Growing awareness of the environmental and health impacts of unburned and partially pyrolyzed hydrocarbons emitted by flaring establishes a need for instru-
mentation  that  can  quantify  the  performance  of  flares  in  terms  of  overall  combustion  efficiency  (CE)  as  well  as  the  destruction  removal  efficiency  (DRE)  of  a
particular species. Climate modelers and policymakers need CE estimates to calculate the overall contribution of flaring to global methane inventories, so they may
understand how flare emissions impact climate change and develop science-informed regulations; regulators need tools for enforcing current and emerging rules
governing flare DRE; flare operators need instrumentation to identify problematic operating conditions in real time; and combustion equipment manufacturers need
to quantify improvements in CE/DRE realized through new flare tip designs.

This paper reviews the current state-of-the-art in instrumentation and techniques used for quantifying CE and DRE, with a focus on flaring in the oil and gas sector.
The paper begins with an overview of flaring, followed by a discussion of the aspects of flaring that make this measurement so difficult to carry out. Techniques for
measuring flare CE and DRE are then examined. The paper concludes with an outlook of future challenges and opportunities.

1. Introduction

1.1. Overview of flaring

Flaring is used to dispose of unwanted flammable gases that arise in
industrial scenarios, including purged or waste products from refineries;
associated  gases  from  oil  and  gas  extraction;  vented  gases  from  blast
furnaces;  unused  gases  from  coke  ovens;  and  gaseous  waste  from
chemical production. This paper focuses on flaring activities in the oil
and gas sector, which may be subdivided into three segments: upstream,
where oil and natural gases are extracted; downstream, where the raw
resource streams are converted into their final products through ther-
mochemical processing; and midstream, which connects the upstream
and  downstream  operations.  Flaring  is  used  for  a  range  of  purposes
within these segments, including.

o  Initial start-up flaring, in which hydrocarbon (HC) gas is introduced
into a system to test the functionality of new processes and equip-
ment (e.g., pipeline integrity) and then flared off.

o  Continuous  production  flaring,  which  is  used  to  burn  âassociated
gasâ  that  comes  out  of  solution  when  oil  is  extracted  from  high-
pressure reservoirs.

o  Operational/non-continuous  production  flaring,  which  may  be
planned, due to maintenance and shutdowns, or unplanned (emer-
gency flaring), caused by equipment failures and other unexpected
production  issues.  Emergency  flaring  includes  safety  flaring,  in
which the HC gas is flared to avoid an unsafe operating or working

condition.  These  situations  often  arise  unexpectedly  and  demand
quick resolution.

The equipment used to flare gas varies significantly depending on its
purpose: flares used in the upstream oil and gas segment are often simple
in design and may consist of an elevated flare stack, an electric igniter,
and a flame tip surrounded by a wind shroud to avoid blow-out and fuel
stripping (Fig. 1a). In some cases, upstream flares may be air-assisted to
enhance the mixing between the unburned flare gas and surrounding air,
thus suppressing soot formation and breakthrough. Downstream flares,
particularly those used to consume heavier HCs, may involve additional
equipment such as knock-out drums to remove liquid droplets, auxiliary
fuel  streams,  and  steam-  and  air-assistance  (Fig.  1b).  Fixed  infrared
sensors  may  be  installed  to  ensure  that  the  flare  remains  lit,  since
maintaining a lit condition is a regulatory requirement [1,2].

Globally, approximately 90 % of oil and gas flaring is associated with
the disposal of associated gas, consisting principally of methane (CH4),
from  upstream  oil  and  gas  production  [3].  In  2022,  over  138  billion
cubic  meters  of  gas  was  flared  from  upstream  oil  and  gas  facilities
around the world, producing emissions having the global warming po-
tential (GWP) of nearly 440 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) over a
20-year basis [4]. The remaining 10 % of flaring is mainly attributed to
midstream and downstream facilities [5].

1.2. Environmental and health impacts of flare emissions

In an ideal scenario, unwanted flammable gases are not flared but

Fig. 1. Examples of flares typical of (a) upstream and (b) downstream applications. Upstream flares tend to be simpler and consist of an electrical igniter and a wind
guard to prevent blow-off. Downstream flares are often more elaborate in design and use steam-assist to avoid soot formation. (Photographs by the authors.)

instead used for some other purpose, e.g., generating heat or steam in a
petrochemical plant, onsite power generation, and, particularly in the
case  of  associated  gas,  conversion  into  a  liquified  and  compressed  or
value-added product (e.g., gas-to-liquid or gas-to-methanol conversion
plants)  [6].  Unfortunately,  these  options  are  often  impractical  or  un-
economical due to the intermittency of the gas flow, the lack of appro-
priate infrastructure to store and transport the gas (particularly in the
case of associated gas [3,7]), or the low heating value of the flare gas. In
these scenarios, flaring is often viewed as the safest and most environ-
mentally benign means to dispose of the gas, especially if the alternative
is simply to vent the gas into the atmosphere, due to the high GWP of
most flare gas streams compared with their combustion products, which,
under ideal conditions, consist of CO2 and water [8].

However,  flare  plumes  often  contain  significant  amounts  of  un-
burned or partially pyrolyzed HCs, in both gas and particulate phases,
due  to  poor  mixing  between  the  flare  gases  and  the  surrounding  air,
entrainment  of  non-HC  liquid  carryover  (e.g.,  fracking  fluid)  into  the
flare gas [9], and aerodynamic stripping of fuel from the combustion
zone, among other factors. These emissions, along with other products of
combustion like nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulphur dioxide (SO2), have a
detrimental effect on both the environment and human health through a
variety of pathways [10].

Soot (more specifically black carbon, BC) is one of the most impor-
tant climate-forcing agents through a wide range of mechanisms that act
on both a local and global scale [8]. It also impacts human respiratory
and cardiovascular health [11]; a recent epidemiology study attributed
between 26 and 53 premature deaths in the United States (US) to BC
emissions from flaring annually [12]. Of all the species within a flare
plume, only soot is readily visible to the naked eye; the visible flame is
due mainly to incandescence of soot within the flame envelope, as well
as chemiluminescence of excited radicals in the gas-phase (e.g., a blue or
purple  color).  Soot  particles  that  break  through  the  flame  envelope
without  being  oxidized  are  seen  as  smoke  in  the  downstream  plume.
Many jurisdictions have specific rules governing flare operation based
on the opacity of the flare plume caused by soot. For example, US federal
regulations require flares to have a plume opacity below 20 % for most
operational times [13]. Operators satisfy this requirement by adjusting
flare operating parameters, which include steam- and air-assist injection
rates and auxiliary fuel flow rates [14,15].

While gas-phase emissions arising from incomplete combustion are
mostly  unseen,  they  too  have  considerable  impact.  In  the  context
of upstream flaring, CH4 is of particular concern due to its strong GWP
(80  times  that  of  CO2  over  a  20-year  lifespan  [8]).  The  impact  of
downstream  flaring  on  climate  change  receives  less  attention  only
because downstream flaring constitutes a small fraction (10 %) of total
flare volumes [3]. Moreover, in the US, only 2 % of the overall green-
house  gases  emitted  by  refineries  in  2023  were  from  flares,  with  the
majority (72 %) coming from other combustion processes[5], suggesting
that  these  processes  may  present  better  opportunities  for  reducing
overall  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions  from  refineries.  Instead,  the
main  concern  of  refinery  flaring  pertains  to  the  toxicity  of  the  flare
products,  particularly  highly  reactive  volatile  organic  compounds
(HRVOCS)  [16],  which  lead  to  the  formation  of  air  pollutants  like
formaldehyde  and  ground-level  ozone  [17,18].  A  2006  survey  of  air
quality in the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria area estimated that 76 % of
the VOCs and HRVOCs could be linked directly to refinery flares [18].

Excessive HC emissions from downstream flares are often associated
with steam over-assistance, which is especially prevalent when flaring
the  heavier  HCs  typical  of  downstream  petroleum  and  petrochemical
operations. While injecting steam and air into the flare combustion zone
is intended to suppress soot formation and breakthrough by promoting
turbulent mixing between the HC and oxidizer streams [19], too much
assistance  can  lower  the  net  heating  value  of  the  combustion  zone
(NHVcz), leading to local quenching or complete extinguishment of the
flare. Since gaseous HC emissions are invisible to the unaided eye, op-
erators  may  over-assist  to  suppress  visible  soot  formation  and

breakthrough at the cost of excessive gas-phase emissions.

Flare emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2, collectively referred
to as NOx), generated mainly through thermal decomposition of N2  in
the  air,  are  also  a  major  concern since  they  are  precursors  for  tropo-
spheric  ozone  production  and  are  responsible  for  acid  rain,  as  is  SO2
[20â22].  Emission  of  carbon  monoxide  (CO),  which  arises  through
incomplete HC combustion, is also a health concern in the vicinity of
flares.

Finally, while the health effects of downstream flaring are a concern
due  to  the  variety  of  species  in  the  flare  plume  and  the  proximity  of
many refineries to residential areas, there is also growing evidence that
VOCs,  NOx,  CO,  and  particulate  matter  (PM)  from  upstream  and
midstream flaring pose a serious health risk to nearby communities [23,
24].

1.3. Assessing flare performance

The effectiveness of the flaring process is often quantified by the flare
CE, usually defined as the mass fraction of carbon in the flare gas stream
that is converted into CO2. Given that flare gas streams often consist of
multiple carbon-containing species, a second quantity, the flare DRE, is
also used; it is the fraction of carbon affixed to a particular species in the
flare gas stream (e.g., DRECH4  for CH4) that is converted to a different
compound  (CO2,  CO,  or  some  other  HC)  [15].  These  definitions  are
discussed in more detail in Sec. 2. The environmental impact of flaring is
often  assessed  by  assuming  an  average  CE  of  98  %  as  reported  by
McDaniel [25], which he derived from gas samples extracted from the
plume  of  a  large-scale  flare.  This  estimate  was  supported  by  other
studies, including Pohl et al. [26], who followed a similar methodology
based on extractive sampling of the plume, as well as Haus et al., who
measured  path-integrated  CH4  and  CO2  concentrations  across  the
plumes  of  three  flares  in  the  Netherlands  using  an  open-path  Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer [27].

More recent research casts doubt on the broad applicability of this
figure and, potentially, the underlying methodology used to derive this
number. Given the enormous volumes of gases flared each year and the
high GWP of CH4, even a slight overestimate of flare CE or DRE may
cause  the  impact  of  upstream  flaring  on  climate  change  to  be  under-
estimated by a wide margin. As an example, Plant et al. [28] conducted
airborne  sampling  of  upstream  flare  plumes  in  the  US  and  found  the
DRECH4 of flare plumes was approximately 95 %, dropping to 91 % when
accounting for unlit flares. These authors determined that the difference
between a 98 % and 91 % DRECH4 amounts to underestimating annual
CH4 emissions by roughly 0.48 Tg from upstream flaring in the US alone,
equivalent to the annual GHG emissions from 8.8 million automobiles,
assuming a GWPCH4 of 84 over 20 years [28].

The growing awareness of the impact of flaring emissions on human
health and the environment establishes a need for instrumentation that
can accurately measure flare CE. For example, new regulations in the US
[29,30],  Canada  [31],  and  the  European  Union  [32]  severely  curtail
upstream flaring activities at new facilities and assess a price on CH4
emissions.  Likewise,  particularly  for  downstream  flaring,  regulations
target  emissions  of  specific  species  from  flares  [33,34],  so  there  is  a
growing need for instrumentation that can fingerprint and quantify the
species in the flare plume and can assess the compliance of flaring ac-
tivities  to  these  and  any  future  regulations  designed  to  address  flare
emissions. Within the US, there are also proposed regulations that would
allow  continuous  monitoring  (CM)  technologies  to  aid  in  mandatory
reporting  of  flare  emissions  [35].  Globally,  CM  technologies  are
encouraged under the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 (OGMP 2.0),
a  measurement-based  reporting  framework  established  by  the  United

Flare  operators  need  instrumentation  to  identify  suboptimal  oper-
ating conditions, ideally in real time, while flare equipment manufac-
turers need a way to measure the performance of the next generation of
cleaner  flaring  equipment.  At  a  larger  scale,  flare  emissions  must  be

accurately  measured to  develop sound, fact-based  environmental pol-
icies  and  regulations  and  to  compile  jurisdiction-wide  inventories  to
assess whether countries are adhering to international climate treaties.
Scientists also need these data to forecast how flare emissions impact
climate change through numerical simulations.

A wide range of measurement principles and delivery platforms have
been developed for measuring a range of flare attributes. There  is no
âone-size-fits-allâ  solution, but instead, the suitability of various tech-
nologies will depend on the goal of the measurement. Techniques that
are  suitable  for  surveying  flare  emissions  from  a  basin  as  part  of  a
dedicated field campaign may be unsuitable for CM. Given increasingly
strict  regulations  and  improving  flare  technologies  and  practices,  the
required  accuracy  and  precision  of  these  measurements  are  also
becoming significantly more stringent.

1.4. Scope and organization of paper

The  objective  of  this  paper  is  to  review  available  and  emerging
technologies for evaluating gas-phase emissions from flares. Our scope is
limited to instrumentation that measures the plumes of industrial-scale
flares directly, including remote-sensing and plume-sampling method-
ologies. Small- and intermediate-scale laboratory studies provide critical
insights into flare emissions, their susceptibility to environmental con-
ditions,  and  methods  of  operation  to  minimize  emissions  [19,37].
However, the highly precise instrumentation employed in these studies
is generally not transferrable to working flares due to their size and the
challenge of accessing the flare plume.

For completeness, we also briefly review systems that estimate flare
CE based solely on the flare operating state. Some emerging commercial
systems report flare CE through parametric modeling [38] or machine
learning [39] based on the operating state of the flare. These systems do
not  interrogate  the  flare  plume  directly  but  instead  compile  a  state
variable from easier-to-measure quantities, including the velocity and
composition  of  the  flare  stream  using  ultrasonic  probes,  along  with
ambient environmental conditions, e.g., wind, temperature, and relative
humidity.  The  flare  CE  is  then  inferred  from  the  state  variable  using
models derived from a database of external âcalibration measurementsâ
made on other flares under controlled conditions [38] or from compu-
tational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations [40]. While these systems can
identify operating points that may lead to high emissions [41], they do
not measure the flare CE/DRE directly. We also note that the parametric
and statistical models underlying these methods are subject to their own
uncertainties introduced through the training data, and these must be
considered carefully when deriving the models.

While our paper focuses on estimating CE and DRE of open, lit flares,
which  usually  depend  almost  entirely  on  gas-phase  emissions  [25,26,
42], the significant environmental and health impacts of BC emissions
from flaring have motivated extensive research on measuring particu-
late emissions. This body of research includes near-field plume sampling
[42],  aircraft-based  plume  sampling  [43,44],  and  standoff  extinction
spectroscopy (âDiffuse-Sky LOSAâ [45]). We exclude these studies from
our discussion, but in many scenarios the radiometric techniques used to
measure BC may also be adapted to measure gases in the flare plume.

Our study excludes unlit flares and enclosed combustors, although
many of the techniques described here may be deployed to characterize
emissions from both of these sources. While regulations in many juris-
dictions  mandate  devices  that  ensure  flares  remain  continuously  lit,
recent  studies  have  shown  that  flares  are  often  unlit,  particularly  in
upstream oil and gas operations, and unlit flares account for a sizable
portion  of  overall  CH4  emissions  in  some  regions  [28,46].  Enclosed
combustors are increasingly displacing open flares, despite their higher
cost, as the combustion process within these devices is better controlled
and therefore more complete [47].

It is also noteworthy that flaring efficiency is only one of several key
design  considerations  and  performance  metrics  for  flares.  Other  con-
siderations  include:  (1)  properties  of  the  vent  gas  (flow  rate,

composition, temperature, pressure), (2) facility design/location (utility
costs, steam/air assist availability, flame height, proper installation), (3)
flare  reliability  (minimal  maintenance,  no  failure),  (3)  safety  re-
quirements  (continuous  pilot  flame,  flame  attachment,  reliable  cross
lighting, air infiltration leading to flashback, hydraulics/pressure drop),
(4)  environmental  requirements  (flue  gas  emissions  such  as  NOx  and
SO2, flame radiation, smoke suppression, noise reduction), and (5) social
requirements  (visibility,  noise  reduction)  [2].  These  aspects  of  flare
design and performance are also excluded from this paper.

Finally,  while fixed  and  operating  costs  are  obvious factors in  the
deployment of various technologies, for the most part we consider this
aspect  beyond  the  scope  of  this  paper.  We  do  note,  however,  which
systems  may  or  may  not  be  suitable  for  various  roles,  e.g.,  CM  using
fixed, autonomous sensors versus instruments more suited for periodic
field campaigns.

The paper begins by reviewing the various ways in which flare per-
formance may be defined and measured, including local and global CE/
DRE, how the underlying column densities and mass flow rates needed
to calculate these quantities may be obtained, and the aspects of flaring
that  complicate  this  measurement.  Next,  the  various  technologies  for
measuring and estimating flare emissions are surveyed and compared.
The paper concludes with an overview of future technologies and work
that needs to be done to fully realize these opportunities for quantifying
CE/DRE with uncertainty in industrial flares.

2. Flaring performance

This section reviews various ways of defining and assessing flaring
performance in the context of CE/DRE and identifies the fundamental
spatiotemporal, operational, and measurement issues that contribute to
uncertainty in estimates of these quantities.

2.1. Flaring performance defined

How should flare performance be measured? The answer depends on
the flare being examined and the objective of the analysis. For example,
the  authors  of  a  seminal  2010  study  of  flaring  commissioned  by  the
Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) selected the DRE
of the VOCs (DREVOC) in the flare plume as their primary focus because
of air quality concerns [48], and flare CE as a secondary objective. They
computed DREVOC  and  CE from extractive sampling  measurements in
the plume and CE from remote-sensing measurements. For studies that
focus on the impact of upstream flaring on climate change, a flare per-
formance metric that computes the mass of unburned CH4 escaping from
the flame into the atmosphere is desirable; this is particularly the case
for existing and emerging regulations that target CH4 emissions [49â51].
In this regard, it is more common to focus on DRECH4 or simply overall
CE, since in most cases associated gas consists primarily of CH4. In all
these definitions, the ambient/background concentrations of all species
of  interest  must  be  considered  and  âsubtractedâ  to  isolate  the  perfor-
mance of the flare.

Conceptually, CE is âa measure of the ability of the flame to fully
convert  the  fuel  to  carbon  dioxideâ[52]  or,  in  other  words,  âthe  per-
centage of the total hydrocarbon stream entering the flare that burns
completely  to  form  only  carbon  dioxide  and  waterâ  [48].  A  direct
interpretation of the CE in this context is the ratio of the mass flow rate
of carbon in the form of CO2 at the boundaries of the fully reacted plume
to the mass flow rate of carbon entering the flame in the form of hy-
drocarbon  fuel  [52â55].  Since  combustion  products  are  frequently
measured in concentration units, it is convenient to write this equation
in molar form [55]:

CE =

 ÌnCO2
xâ  ÌnCxHy

(1)

where á¹CO2 is the molar flow rate of CO2 leaving the flare plume, á¹CxHy is

4

K.J. Daun and J.P. Spinti

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 110 (2025) 101235

the molar flow rate of the vent gas entering the flare, and x is the number
of  carbon  atoms  attached  to  each  fuel  molecule.  Equation  (1) can  be
expressed in terms of carbon mass flow rates simply by multiplying the
numerator and denominator by the atomic mass of carbon,

CE =

 ÌnCO2
xâ  ÌnCxHy

MC
MC

=

 ÌmC,CO2
 ÌmC,fuel

(2)

where   ÌmC,CO2 and   ÌmC,fuel are the mass flow rates of carbon affixed to the
CO2 in the flare plume and to the gas stream supplied to the flare.

A drawback of Eqs. (1) and (2) is that both the composition and rate
of the flare gas entering the flare must be known, which may not be the
case due to a lack of information about the underlying flaring process,
such as for fenceline measurements. Instead, the denominator of Eq. (2)
may be inferred through a mass or molar balance of all the fully reacted,
carbon-containing  species entering and  leaving a  control volume that
envelops the flare tip and plume [56]:

dMC,CV
dt

=  ÌmC,fuel (cid:0)

 ÌmC,CO2 (cid:0)

 ÌmC,CO (cid:0)

 ÌmC,THC (cid:0)

 ÌmC,soot â 0

(3)

where MC,CV denotes the total mass of carbon within the control volume
at any instant, and âTHCâ denotes the total unburned hydrocarbons in
the plume. Equation (3) only applies if the accumulation term is zero,
which is generally not true instantaneously and only occurs on average
over a long timescale that must be determined, and only if the flare is
operated in a steady manner. In practice, then, the mass flow rates are
taken as âtime-averagedâ  over the duration of the measurement. This
equation also neglects the advection of carbon-containing species into
the control volume from the upwind surface, which should be a minor
contributor to the overall carbon balance. If these terms are subtracted
from the measured mass flow rates in Eq. (3), the adjusted mass flow
rates would be considered âenhancementsâ to the mass flow rates caused
by the flare.

By rearranging Eq. (3) to solve for   ÌmC,fuel and substituting the result

into Eq. (2), one arrives at [57].

CE =

 ÌmC,CO2
 ÌmC,CO2 +  ÌmC,THC +  ÌmC,CO +  ÌmC,soot

(4)

An equivalent formula in terms of molar flow rates is obtained by
dividing the numerator and denominator of Eq. (4) by the atomic mass
of carbon [25,26,48].

For non-smoking flares, the mass flow rate of soot,   ÌmC,soot, is negli-
gible  and  thus  ignored  [25,26,53].  For  smoking  flares,  results  vary.
McDaniel [25] determined that accounting for soot reduced measured
CE from the 98.8â99.8 % range to the 91.2â97.8 % range depending on
the test. On the other hand, Pohl et al. found that soot accounted for less
than 0.5 % of the unburned HC emissions, even in the case of smoking
flares [26].

Alternatively, the CE is often defined based on the concentration of

species at a particular location within the plume, e.g. [58].

CE =

[CO2]
[CO2] + [CO] + [CH4] + â¯

(5)

where [â] denotes any concentration unit, e.g. parts-per-million (ppm),
moles/m3, or molecules/m3. This definition is consistent with Eq. (2)
provided that the plume is well mixed and spatially uniform and that the
quantities in Eqs. (2) and (3) are time-averaged over a window suffi-
ciently long to capture stationary-state behavior, although, as we will
show,  these  conditions  are  often  not  satisfied  [59].  In  the  case  of
imaging-based techniques, it is also common to define

CE =

ÏÊ¹
C,CO2

ÏÊ¹
C,CO2

+ ÏÊ¹

C,CO

+ ÏÊ¹

C,CH4

+ â¯

(6)

where Ïâ²C,X is the column density of carbon mass (kg/m2) associated with
species X that is integrated along a path that traverses the plume normal

5

to the image plane, typically centered on a specified pixel. Equivalently,
the CE may be expressed as the ratio of column number densities, nâ²k
(ppmâm),

CE =

Ê¹
n
CO2

Ê¹
n
CO2
Ê¹
+ n
CH4

Ê¹
+ n
CO

+ ...

(7)

which are found by integrating the number density of the kth species
along a path. Equation (6) may be converted into Eq. (7) by dividing the
mass column densities by the atomic mass of carbon and multiplying the
numerator and denominator by the path-averaged number density of the
gas mixture.

We  emphasize  that  the  above  definitions  are  not  all  equivalent.
Concentrations  and  column  densities  do  not  capture  the  effect  of
nonuniform velocities throughout the plume and thus may be poor ap-
proximations of CE in regions of the flare plume where there is signifi-
cant spatial variation in velocity.

The DRE quantifies how efficiently a specific component in the flare
vent gas is destroyed in the flare, that is, converted to a different com-
pound (e.g., CO2, CO, or other intermediate HCs) [58,60]. A narrower
definition of DRE is how effectively a specific fuel component is broken
down into non-HC molecules (CO, CO2, and H2O) [2]. Using the more
general definition of destruction, the DRE for a target species X can be
written as [54,56,58].

DREX = 1 (cid:0)

 ÌmX,plume
 ÌmX,in

(8)

where   Ìmx,plume and   Ìmx,in denote the mass flow rates of the target species
x  in  the  fully  reacted  flare  plume  and  vent  gas  entering  the  flare,
respectively.  As  is  the  case  with  CE,  it  is  also  commonplace  to  use  a
concentration-based DRE,
DREX = 1 (cid:0) yX,out
yX,in

(9)

where yX,out and yX,in denote the fraction of carbon in the form of X in the
exhaust gases and input vent gases, respectively [58]. The carbon mole
or  mass  fraction  may  be  inferred  through  point  concentration  mea-
surements provided the plume is spatially uniform in composition and
temporally averaged. Finally, path-averaged DREs may be defined that
are analogous to Eqs. (6) and (7). In contrast to the CE, it is not possible
to  define  the  DRE  knowing  only  the  composition  of  the  plume;  some
information must be known or assumed about the composition of the
flare vent gas [56]. As is the case for CE, the definitions in Eqs. (8) and
(9) are not equivalent as the impact of mass flux is ignored in Eq. (9).

Comparing Eqs. (1) and (8), the DRE for a specific component of the
vent  gas  will  always  be  greater  than  or  equal  to  the  CE  [15,54].  Ac-
cording to Schwartz et al., âA flare operating with a combustion effi-
ciency of 98 % can achieve a destruction efficiency in excess of 99.5 %â
[2].  This  representative  difference  of  1.5  %  is  supported  by  the  US
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) [61], with the additional note
that, âThe relationship between destruction and combustion efficiency is
not constant and changes with different compounds.â

2.2. Measuring flaring performance

In  this  section,  we  review  the  major  challenges  associated  with
measuring flare performance. Much of the reviewed work focuses on CE,
but the issues apply equally to DRE and CH4 emissions.

2.2.1.

Instrument models

Neither  CE,  DRE,  nor  any  species  concentration  or  mass  flux  is
measured  directly but is  instead inferred  from other types  of  indirect
measurements  made  on  the  flare  plume  via  an  instrument  model.  The
instrument model depends on the specific definition of CE or DRE, what
exactly  in  the  plume  is  being  measured,  where  in  the  plume  the

throughout  the  flare  plume  [63];  this  technology  has  been  commer-
cialized  as  the  FlareGuardianTM  system  [64],  intended  for  continuous
monitoring. The methodology, described in detail in Section 3.2.3, infers
the ratio of column densities based on the ratio of spectral intensities
aligned with key vibrational-rotational bands of the species of interest.
While  general  aspects  of  the  instrument  model  are  provided,  certain
proprietary technical details of the algorithm are not included, which
complicates any analysis of the uncertainty attached to the CE estimates.

2.2.2. Spatial heterogeneity

Flare CE can be measured locally or globally. Local CE measurements
are based on the relative amounts of combustion products at a single
point, Eq. (5), or as column densities along an LOS, Eqs. (6) and (7).
Global CE is based on an overall carbon balance as shown in Eqs. (2)â(4).
In principle, this requires quantifying each of the mass flow rates shown
in  Fig.  2,  which  is  challenging  to  do  in  the  field.  Even  in  controlled
laboratory  settings,  capturing  and  analyzing  the  effluent  of  an  entire
flare  plume  has  only  been  performed  for  low  crosswind  scenarios.
Bourguignon  et  al.  report  CE  estimates  from  small  diffusion  flames
operating  in  a  closed-loop  wind  tunnel,  derived  by  sampling  the
composition of the wind tunnel gases [55]. However, even this carefully
controlled  experiment  had  several  significant  sources  of  uncertainty,
including infiltration of ambient air into the wind tunnel, exfiltration of
the  plume  gases  from  the  tunnel,  and  recirculation  of  combustion
products within the tunnel. A significant advancement of this technique
using a much larger closed-loop wind tunnel was reported by Burtt et al.
[65]. Their methodology, based on an unsteady carbon mass balance in
a control volume inside the wind tunnel, corrected a previous error in
the mass balance [55]. They assessed their methodology with a Monte
Carlo uncertainty and sensitivity analysis and demonstrated that overall
uncertainties (combined bias and precision) of <1 % CE were achievable
from  this  carefully  controlled  experiment.  This  level  of  uncertainty
provides  some  important  context  for  measurement  limitations  under
more challenging, real-world conditions.

Due to the difficulties of applying a rigorous carbon balance over a
control volume, it is common practice to approximate the global CE with
a local CE made at representative locations in the plume. In this case, the
spatial inhomogeneity of the flare plume needs to be considered. Pohl
et al. [26] used an extraction probe in a protected outdoor test facility to
sample the flare plume at various locations across the flame radius. They
found that CE was lowest at the edge of the flames and highest in the
middle. In a study performed at the pilot-scale (flare tip diameters from
2 to 6 mm), Strosher [66] sampled the flare plume with (1) a multiprobe
system in a plane perpendicular to the flame and (2) a hood sampler that
provided  an  integrated  sample  for  computing  global  CE.  The  results
from  the  hood  samples  were  similar  to  those  obtained  from  the
single-point probe at the center of the plume. Torres et al. [67] analyzed
reproducibility in the TCEQ test series by selecting tests of steam- and
air-assisted flares where DREpropylene >70 %. This threshold was chosen
âbecause  flames  with  lower  DREs/CEs  were  likely  to  display  greater
variability  in  DRE/CE  depending  on  the  location  of  the  extractive
sampler, while flames with higher DREs/CEs generally showed consis-
tent DRE/CE values at a variety of sampling positions within the flame.â
In other words, the impact of spatial inhomogeneity on global CE in-
creases as CE decreases [68].

Selecting  a  representative  location  in  a  system  that  is  spatially
inhomogeneous is an empirical procedure. In the TCEQ flare tests, the
location  of  the  sample  collection  system  was  âthe  center  of  the  flare
plume at a distance far enough downwind from the flare tip to ensure
that  combustion  reactions  had  ceased  and  with  the  face  of  the  inlet
oriented perpendicular to the travel of the plumeâ [48]. In the flare tests
performed for the Marathon Petroleum Consent Decree, the gas species
in Eq. (5) were measured with a remote-sensing device, the PFTIR (Sec.
3.2.2).  According  to  the  authors,  âThe  optimum  aiming  point  for  the
PFTIR is typically about one flame length from the flame tip. This en-
sures that all combustion is complete prior to measurementâ  [62,69].

Fig. 2. Control volume used to define flare CE based on conservation of carbon
mass, Eqs. (1)â(4). The analysis assumes that the mass of carbon within the CV
is invariant with time, which is only true for long averaging times and when the
flare is operated in a steady manner. The analysis also neglects the advection of
carbon-containing species into the CV through upwind surfaces.

measurement is made, and what kind of spatial and temporal averaging
is  occurring.  For  example,  Gogolek  et  al.  [54]  define  CE  as  the  âper-
centage of the mass of carbon as carbon dioxide in the stack gas relative
to mass of fuel-bound carbonâ, which is consistent with Eq. (2), while
others define CE based on the volume concentrations of the species in
the plume after combustion has ceased [25,48]. Johnson and Kostiuk
refer  to  measuring the  accumulation rates  of CO2, CO,  and unburned
hydrocarbons produced by the flame [53]. Still others define CE based
on column densities (e.g., ppmâm, kg/m2) evaluated along lines-of-sight
(LOSs)  normal  to  the  viewing  plane  of  the  flare  and  located  at  some
defined  location  downstream  of  the  flare  tip  [53].  These  statements
imply different instrument models for translating plume measurements
into the quantity of interest (QOI), CE/DRE. Understanding the under-
lying instrument model is critical in analyzing the various methodolo-
gies for measuring CE/DRE.

While  a  detailed  instrument  model  specific  to  the  measurement
technology may be available, this is by no means always true, e.g., the
model algorithm may be proprietary/confidential. The extractive mea-
surements  conducted  for  the  TCEQ  tests,  described  in  detail  within
Appendix I in Ref. [48], represent a case where the instrument model is
known. Samples were extracted via a sample collector at the center of
the flare plume and far enough downwind for the combustion reactions
to have completed. An eductor continuously drew sample through the
collector to a series of analyzers and instruments. The instrument model
for  computing  CE/DRE  from  this  extractive  sampling  includes  a
time-series data analysis to distinguish constituents in the flare plume
from those same constituents in the ambient background coupled with a
carbon-balance method using measurements of any carbon-containing
species of âsignificant abundance.â

A  different  instrument  and  instrument  model  were  used  in  a  test
series performed for the Marathon Petroleum Consent Decree [62]. The
experimental team used a Passive Fourier Transform Infrared (PFTIR)
spectrometer to infer column densities of various species along an LOS
through the flare plume. The instrument was pointed at a location two
flame  lengths  downwind  from  the  flare  tip.  In  this  way,  the  ambient
wind speed and direction, which determine the measurement location,
were implicitly included in the instrument model. The test report pro-
vides detailed descriptions  of the measurement  procedure and  instru-
ment  model  used  to  convert  infrared  radiance  spectra  to  species
concentrations  and  then  to  local  CE  (see  Appendices  A.4  and  A.5  of
Ref.  [62]);  however,  proprietary  software  is  required  for  some  of  the
analysis.

More  recently,  Zeng  and  coworkers  demonstrated  how  a  hyper-
spectral  camera  could  be  used  to  measure  local  CE  simultaneously

The ambiguity of these descriptions reveals the difficulty with sampling
reproducibility and with obtaining the most representative sample.

To  illustrate  the  spatial  heterogeneity  of  local  CE,  consider  the
instantaneous CE field shown in Fig. 3a, obtained from a CFD/large eddy
simulation (CFD-LES) of a steam-assisted flare operating at high turn-
down  with  a  crosswind  speed  of  2.24  m/s  [70].  The  NHVcz  for  this
scenario is ~9 kJ/sm3  (300 BTU/scf) and the vent gas exit velocity is
1.22 m/s (4 ft/s). Contours show the local CE for each computational
cell in the two-dimensional slice through the midplane of the simulation,
calculated  using  Eq.  (5).  According  to  rules  promulgated  by  the  EPA
[61], a flare operating with a NHVcz >270 BTU/scf (~8 kJ/m3) with a
minimum exit velocity of 1.22 m/s would be expected to have a global
DRE of 98 %, corresponding to a CE of 96.5 %.

For  the  experimental  CE  measurement,  the  PFTIR  was  aimed  at  a
location  two  flame  lengths  from  the  flare  tip  [62,69].  This  location,
approximated  in  the  simulation  using  the  time-averaged  temperature
field  (see  Fig.  3b),  is  indicated  with  a  crosshair  in  Fig.  3.  The  circle
surrounding  the  crosshair  represents  the  PFTIR  field-of-view  in  the
experiment, which subtends a region of high local CE while completely
missing the region of low CE in the wake of the flare stack. This low CE
region results from fuel stripping, which occurs when fuel is diverted
from the combustion zone by vortices formed in the wake of the flare
stack, resulting in a region of unburned fuel beneath the reaction zone in
the buoyant combustion plume [53].

Crosswind-induced  fuel  stripping  was  first  proposed  by  Johnson
et al. [52,53]. Their wind tunnel experiments on 1â²â² (25.4 mm) and 3â²â²
(76.2  mm)  diameter  flare  tips,  as  shown  in  Fig.  4,  revealed  a  strong,
nonlinear relationship between CE and crosswind speed (see Fig. 5a) at
low momentum flux ratios (MFRs), defined as

MFR =

ÏjâV2
j
ÏââV2
â

(10)

where Ï and V denote density and velocity and subscripts âjâ and âââ are
the fuel jet and crosswind, respectively. Johnson et al. [52] examined
several  possible  mechanisms  to  explain  these  observations  and
concluded that the fuel-stripping mechanism best described the data. A
2012 US EPA report [61] reviewed efforts made to date to correlate flare
CE  with  MFR  but  concluded  that,  due  to  the  complexity  of  this  phe-
nomenon, MFR alone is insufficient to predict the extent of stripping.
This conclusion highlights the need for both CFD-LES data and experi-
mental  measurements  to  characterize  the  impact  of  crosswinds  on
CE/DRE. Recent work by Burtt et al. [37] in a larger, closed-loop wind
tunnel  allowed  for  4â²â²  (101.6  mm)  diameter  flare  tips,  a  regime  that
overlaps with full-scale flares. Their carbon conversion inefficiency re-
sults (1(cid:0) CE) versus crosswind speed plotted in Fig. 5b lend credence to
the  hypothesis  that crosswind-induced fuel  stripping  impacts  the per-
formance of operating flares.

New  infrared  imaging  technology  offers  a  means  to  visualize  the
entire flare plume and is therefore less susceptible to issues caused by
plume heterogeneity. However, challenges remain with temporal reso-
lution, the measurement of fluxes in addition to concentrations, and the
ability  to  measure  unburned,  stripped  fuel  that  may  be  significantly
colder compared to the hot combustion products. These technologies are
reviewed in Sec. 3.2.3.

2.2.3. The myth of steady state

Many  CE/DRE  measurement  techniques  model  the  flare  plume  as
being at steady state and thus assume that time-averaged measurements
yield  the  same  CE/DRE  as  values  obtained  from  an  instantaneous
snapshot of the flare plume. However, real-world flares exhibit a high
degree of temporal variation that needs to be accounted for in deter-
mining global CE. Pohl et al. referred to this feature as intermittency or
âthe fraction of the time the flame is present at position râ [26]. They
proposed an equation for computing the global CE from local CE mea-
surements that includes an intermittency factor and weighting by the
velocity and area from which the probe sampled. Because of this inter-
mittency, the local CE (measured along the axis of the flare tip) over-
estimated the global CE of the flare, although in practice the authors
determined  that  the  error  was  small,  usually  less  than  50  %  of  com-
bustion inefficiency (1(cid:0) CE) [26].

The  wind  tunnel  tests  conducted  by  Johnson  et  al.  examined  in-
homogeneity  in  low-momentum,  CH4  or  propane  jet  diffusion  flames
under crossflow conditions [52,53]. Fig. 4 shows examples of the short-
long-exposure  photographs  of  propane  flames.  While  the
and
long-exposure photographs show the overall flame position and size, the
short-exposure  images  reveal  complex  and  transient  structures,
including  shear  layer  vortices  [53].  It  is  the  interaction  of  these
fluid-mechanic  structures  with  the  local  combustion  reaction  regime
that  causes  the  stripping  mechanism  described  in  Sec.  2.2.2.:  intense
local mixing of fuel with air that dilutes the fuel below its lower flam-
mability limit. The presence of this mechanism is supported by the local
extinction  events  observed  in  the  short-exposure  images  [53].  The
process  by  which  unburned  fuel  is  ejected  from  these  experimental
flames is highly intermittent and spatially variable [52].

Seymour and Johnson [59] investigated the time correlation of BC
and H2O concentrations in a laboratory flare (1â²â² or 3â²â² diameters) burning
synthetic  flare  gas  having  a  composition  typical  of  either  the  Bakken
formation in North Dakota or the Ecuadorian oil region. Instantaneous
BC and H2O column densities were measured across the plume simul-
taneously based on the transmittance of distributed feedback lasers at
1428 nm and 1654 nm. The 1428 nm laser was scanned across two H2O
absorption  peaks,  while  the  wavelength  of  the  1654  nm  laser,  which
targeted broadband soot absorption, was held constant.

The objective of these measurements was to examine the assumption
of many CE measurement techniques: a carbon balance for computing
CE/DRE  can  be  closed  using  the  relative  concentrations  of  species
measured  at  one  location  in  the  flare  plume.  Often  this  treatment  is
justified by arguing that (1) the plume is well mixed and thus the species
are well correlated, or (2) the number of measurements is sufficient to
minimize any bias or uncertainty resulting from this assumption. Sey-
mour and Johnson [59] observed positive skewness and variability in
the instantaneous BC/H2O ratios that call these assumptions into ques-
tion and suggested that the amount of temporal and/or spatial averaging
needed  to  obtain  the  âtrueâ  BC/H2O  ratio  for  the  flare  should  be
considered carefully. They concluded that a single measurement would
most probably return the mode of the skewed distribution, which was
~13 % less than the mean for both types of flare gas (Fig. 6). The skewed
distribution implies that a BC/H2O ratio calculated from a small sample
size would likely be biased toward low ratio values, thus missing the
infrequent  bursts  of  BC  production  observed  by  the  authors.  Conse-
quently,  inadequate  sampling  would  cause  the  CE/DRE  to  be  biased
toward higher values. While not considered in this study, the authors
expect  the  BC/CO2  ratios  to  follow  similar  trends.  The  broader

implication, however,  is that this wide variation in the instantaneous
LOS  species  concentration  ratios  introduces  considerable  uncertainty
into measurements (i.e., instrument models) that assume these ratios are
fixed.

A final consideration regarding the steady-state assumption for flares
is that of rogue events, defined as infrequent phenomena that have an
outsized effect on the mean outcome of a system. The infrequent bursts
of BC production in laboratory-scale flare plumes [59], evidenced by the
positive  skewness  in  BC/H2O  ratios  in  Fig.  6,  are  one  such  example.
These bursts populate the distributionâs long tail and have an outsized
influence on the mean value. In the case of industrial flares, a rogue eddy
rich in unburned CH4 or in BC may exit the combustion zone of the flare
by the fuel stripping mechanism described above. Conrad and Johnson
[71]  identified  such  rogue  events  when  they  described  the  stochastic
nature of the BC emission rate data from nine field flares during mea-
surement campaigns in Veracruz, Mexico and Orellana, Ecuador. Fig. 7
displays  a  subset  of  these  data  for  one  flare.  Eight  of  the  nine  flares
exhibited positive skewness, which the authors attributed to intermit-
tent bursts of high BC production within localized areas of the plume.
Similar observations were reported by the EPA in their 2014 survey of
enclosed ground combustor (EGC) emissions from upstream well sites
[72].  Plume  measurements  made  using  PFTIR  (Sec.  3.2.2)  and
mid-wavelength  infrared  (MWIR)  hyperspectral  imaging  (Sec.  3.2.3)
showed that the overall CE of these processes is dominated by infrequent

Fig. 8. The overall CE defined by Eq. (3) may be estimated by integrating the
product  of  the  column  densities  of  carbon-containing  species  and  a  2D-mass
weighted  velocity  along  a  control  line.  This  is  not  equivalent  to  averaging  a
pixel-wise local CE, Eq. (7), over the same line.

flash emission events.

How  do  we  capture  rogue  events  in  flaring  and  account  for  their
impact  on  the  global,  time-integrated  CE?  The  solution  may  lie  in
coupling experimental measurements taken at higher spatial resolution
over longer time frames with data obtained from CFD-LES simulations
where the time-varying interactions of the combustion reactions and the
turbulent eddies are computed.

2.2.4. From local to global CE/DRE

Fig. 3a shows instantaneous values of local CE in one slice through
the middle of the computational domain. How should we determine the
global CE from these data? According to Eq. (2), global CE is defined
based on the mass flux of CO2  exiting the boundary of the flare plume
(where  no  further  reaction  occurs)  relative  to  the  mass  flux  of  fuel
entering the flame through the flare tip. If the mass flow rates of carbon-
containing species are assumed to enter the control volume shown in
Fig. 2 through the flare stack and leave through the downwind face, the
global CE may be written as

â«

nCO2uân dA
â
A

xknkuân dA

CE =

where A is the area of the downwind surface, nk is the number density of
the kth species, xk is the number of carbon atoms contained in a mole-
cule of the kth species, uk is the velocity vector, and n is the unit normal
vector  pointing  out  of  the  control  volume.  The  number  densities  and
velocities  are  never  known  as  continuous  functions  and  can  only  be
sampled at a limited number of locations in the plume (e.g., Refs. [26,
66].).

It is also important to note that Eq. (11) is not equivalent to inte-
grating the local CE, defined by Eq. (5), over the downwind face of the
CV. First, the denominator in Eq. (11) accounts for the mass flux of all
carbon-containing species over the control surface, while averaging the
pixelwise CEs normalizes the CO2 column density of the pixel LOS by the
total column density of the carbon-containing species at a given loca-
tion. Accordingly, area elements containing more carbon mass should
have a greater influence on the global CE, but this is not the case when
averaging the local CE values over the total area. Second, as explained in
Sec.  2.2.2,  averaging  the  local  CE  estimates  does  not  account  for  the
nonuniform projected velocity profile.

Particularly in the case of remote sensing, various instrument models
have been proposed to compute global CE from local CE measurements
for  individual  pixels.  In  the  PFTIR  approach  (Sec.  3.2.2),  a  local  CE

consistent  with  Eq.  (7) is  computed  based  on  the  spectrally  resolved
intensity  measured  along  an  LOS  located  at  a  prescribed  distance
downwind of the visible flame; this local CE is taken to be representative
of the global CE. In the VISR/FlareGuardianTM  technique (Sec. 3.2.3),
local values of CE are computed for multiple pixels within a region of
interest outside a flame envelope and then averaged to obtain a global
CE value.

Both  the  PFTIR  and  VISR/FlareGuardianTM  approaches  introduce
potentially  significant  errors  in  the  computation  of  global  CE.  For
example, Eq. (4) may be rewritten as

where  uk  denotes  a  2D  mass-weighted  projected  velocity,  Ìn  is  a  unit
normal vector, and the integration is carried out over a control line Î in
the image plane, as shown in Fig. 8. (Note that the projected velocity
may be different for each species due to heterogeneous plume compo-
sition.) As is the case for Eq. (11), Eq. (12) is not equivalent to averaging
local pixelwise CE estimates, Eq. (7). Alternatively, the integrands in Eq.
(12) may  be  estimated  by  converting  spectrally  resolved  intensity
measurements into column densities and combining these with 2D ve-
locity fields inferred through feature tracking between successive plume
images. This technique is possible using IFTSs, as discussed in Sec. 3.2.3.
However, inferring the local species concentrations along each LOS in-
volves approximations that also introduce uncertainty in the global CE
estimate.

3. Current techniques for measuring flare emissions

3.1. Plume sampling methods

All techniques used to estimate flare CE/DRE or emission rate of a
particular species of interest require some means to determine the flare
plume  composition.  The  most  direct  way  to  do  this  is  to  extract  gas-
phase samples from the flare plume and identify the composition and

10

concentration of species within these samples through online or offline
measurements. These concentrations are then related to the composition
of the flare plume at the sample location.

3.1.1. Near-field sampling: how shiny is the gold standard?

Near-field sampling is generally considered the âgold standardâ for
determining flare plume composition, and hence CE or DRE, and is the
basis for the earliest experimental attempts to quantify flare CE or DRE,
e.g., Refs. [16,25â27,56,57,73]. The plume is usually sampled by posi-
tioning  an  extractor  hood  above  the  flare  plume  using a  crane  or  lift
(Fig.  9).  Continuous  emission  monitors,  such  as  tunable  diode  laser
absorption  spectrometers  (TDLAS),  cavity  ringdown  spectrometers
(CRDS),  and  non-dispersive  infrared  analyzers  (NDIRs)  can  measure
mass fractions of various VOCs, CO, CO2, O2, and NOx [25,66] with some
degree of temporal resolution (e.g., 1 Hz), although the sampling process
introduces a time lag and âtemporal blendingâ. Alternatively, samples
may be extracted into TedlarÂ® bags, stainless steel cannisters, or similar
containers, and then processed offline using more exacting methods, like
gas  chromatography/mass  spectrometry  [16],  which  is  particularly
useful when analyzing for a wide range of trace species. Table 1 shows
examples of the instrumentation that may be used to measure gas ana-
lytes  extracted  from  the  flare  plumes.  Gas  chromatography  is  also
routinely used to analyze the contents and heating value of the flare vent
gas, particularly for downstream flaring.

Sample  lines  should  be  heated  to  prevent  water  vapor  from
condensing prior to chemical analysis, or a trap may be used to remove
moisture to allow for analysis of the âdryâ  analyte. In some cases, an
inert tracer may be added to the flare vent gas to assess the amount of
diluent that is introduced into the sample line, which must be accounted
for when relating the composition of the analyte to species concentra-
tions within the plume [57]; correlations in the concentrations between
plume species may also be used to infer air entrainment, reasoning that
the plume species are diluted at the same rate [16,56]. A further concern
is the lifetime of some intermediate species, which may continue to react
and decompose after the sample has been extracted from the plume.

Plume sampling is impractical for in-service flares due to the inac-
cessibility of the flare plume. Moreover, even if plume sampling were
possible at a refinery, this would not be the case for many upstream and
midstream  flares  in  remote  locations  and  operating  under  primitive
conditions.  Nevertheless,  physical  probing  is  routinely  used  as  a
benchmark to assess the performance of other CE or DRE measurement
techniques [63,68], particularly during technology âshowdownsâ  [48]
and as an information source for the emerging class of data-driven flare
measurement  and  control  technologies  [38].  The  composition  and
flow rate of the flare vent gas is well known and controlled precisely
during these tests, so âground truthâ CE and DRE may be obtained from
Eqs.  (6) and  (9),  respectively,  using  the  concentrations  of  CO,  CO2
and/or target species (e.g., CH4) measured in the flare plume, assuming
that the plume is well mixed and at steady state.

Any discussion of uncertainty in plume sampling is usually limited to

K.J. Daun and J.P. Spinti

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 110 (2025) 101235

the  accuracy  and  precision  of  the  instrument  used  to  examine  the
extracted  analyte  (e.g.,  Ref.  [16]),  but  uncertainty  in  the  CE  or  DRE
derived from extractive measurements is almost certainly dominated by
flare plume dynamics that cannot be captured due to the limited spatial
and temporal resolution of probing.

Near-field  measurements  are  particularly  sensitive  to  plume  het-
erogeneity and intermittency, as discussed in Sec. 2.2.3. As an example,
a recent study by Evans et al. focused on measuring the CE and DRE of
three  different flare  tips under various momentum  flux ratio, NHVCZ,
and crosswind conditions. The CE and DRE were inferred from online
concentration  measurements  of  combustion  gases  sampled  via  an
extractor located downwind of the visible flame. The extractor inlet was
instrumented with three thermocouples, and the hood was  located to
â¦
ensure that the average temperature remained between 300
F
(149
C) to ensure that the inlet was sampling combustion prod-
ucts and that the combustion process was complete. Evans et al. esti-
mated  the  overall  CE/DRE  uncertainty  by  combining  the  uncertainty
associated with the resolution of the online sensors with a replication
uncertainty  meant  to  capture  the  effect  of  plume  intermittency  and
heterogeneity  [73].  They  found  the  uncertainty  in  their  estimates  to
scale with combustion inefficiency; for DRE >98 %, the median 68 %
confidence  interval  was  Â±0.11  (in  units  of  %DRE)  but  grew  rapidly,
mainly due to intermittency.

It is unclear, however, whether positioning the extractor inlet at one
location is sufficient to represent the overall flare emissions. As a case in
point,  any  fuel-rich  region  beneath  the  flare  caused  by  fuel  stripping
would likely be missed by a hood extractor located above the flare, like
the one shown in Fig. 9a. Likewise, offline, and even online, extractive
sampling  may  miss  intermittent  effects  like  flare  âsputteringâ  [68].
Consequently,  the  results  of  these  studies  should  be  interpreted  with
caution. For example, while extractive measurements may distinguish
between acceptable and unacceptable operating conditions, e.g., from
over-steaming, is it possible to definitively distinguish a CE of 98 % from
99.5  %  in  view  of  the  inherent  assumptions  and  approximations
involved in connecting point concentration measurements in the plume
to the overall flare performance? In the authorsâ opinion, this level of
accuracy has not been demonstrated adequately, particularly in view of
spatially inhomogeneous flare plumes (Sec. 2.2.2) and ârogue eventsâ
(Sec.  2.2.3),  due  to  the  low  spatial  and  temporal  resolution  of  the
extraction probes.

A  particular  concern  is  when  CE  and  DRE  estimates  derived  from
near-field extractive measurements are used to train expert systems [38,
74,75], several of which have been commercialized [76,77], since the
robustness of the training data has not been established.

3.1.2. Far-field sampling

A  second  class  of  extractive  measurements  involves  sampling  the
plume  further  downwind  from  the  flare.  Far-field  sampling  measure-
ments are  often  conducted as  part of environmental monitoring  cam-
paigns, not necessarily with the cooperation of the flare operator. The
key distinction between the near-field and far-field measurements is the
additional  mixing  that  occurs  as  the  plume  travels  downstream.
Consequently,  the  assumption  of  a  homogenous  plume  may  be  more
reasonable compared to those encountered in near-field measurements
[48], a key difference to consider when developing appropriate instru-
ment models for these two types of sampling approaches. The drawbacks
of  far-field  measurements  are  the  inherently  lower  concentrations  of
target species caused by air entrainment and dilution, the lack of tem-
poral resolution, and the difficulty of identifying the plume location.

Instrument models developed for far-field sampling include methods
for determining CO2  enhancements measured in the plume relative to
measurements  made  outside  the  plume.  A  further  challenge  concerns
distinguishing the species emitted by a particular flare from contribu-
tions of other local sources, which is generally not a concern in instru-
ment  models  for  the  near-field  sampling  regime.  In  the  case  of  DRE
estimates, some assumptions must be made about the composition of the
flare  vent  gas  since  it  is  generally  unknown  for  a  specific  flare.  With
downstream refining, the composition may be inferred from annual in-
ventories  reported  by  the  flare  owners  [58],  while  an  associated  gas
composition  typical  of  a  given  basin  may  be  assumed  with  upstream
flaring [28].

Downstream measurements may be made from the ground or in the
air.  For  example,  Wood  et  al.  [58]  conducted  ground-based  mobile
measurements of flare plumes in the Houston area using an Aerodyne
Mobile Laboratory,  which  was  stationary during  measurements. They
assumed that the plume was released from a height of 65â70 m and then
transported to the ground through atmospheric mixing. Measurements
were  made  approximately  400â800  m  downstream  of  the  flare;  this
distance  is  a  trade-off  between  being  far  enough  away  to  ensure  the
plume  is  well  mixed  at  ground  level  but  sufficiently  close  to  avoid
contributions from other nearby emission sources. The CE was estimated
using Eq. (5), with concentrations scaled and regressed versus the CO
concentrations  to  distinguish  the  concentrations  of  carbon-containing
species  within  the  flare  exhaust  from  background  concentrations,
which  may  be  considerable  in  an  industrial  area.  The  authors  also
evaluated flare DRE on a concentration basis via Eq. (9).

Aircraft are increasingly being used to measure flare emissions and
CE [21,28,43,78]. Typically, the aircraft conducts multiple transects of a
single  plume.  (In  this  context,  a  transect  is  a  discrete  traverse  of  the
plume  from  one  side  to  the  other.)  The  start  and  end  of  the  transect

should  be  far  enough  from  the  influence  of  the  plume  to  experience
background  CH4  conditions.  The  sensor  package  onboard  the  aircraft
may include a CRDS, which is highly sensitive to CH4, C2H6, and CO2,
and other sensors to measure NOx  and PM. The peak enhancement to
CO2  ([ÎCO2]) and CH4 ([ÎCH4]) concentrations (and other species) in
the plume is determined relative to concentration measurements made
outside of the plume (Fig. 10a). The CE and DRE values are then ob-
tained by regressing  ÎCH4  versus ÎCO2, as shown in Fig. 10b. These
studies often focus on DRECH4, which may be approximated by

DRECH4 = 1 (cid:0)

[ÎCH4]
yCH4[ÎCO2] + [ÎCH4]

(13)

where yCH4 is the assumed mole fraction of CH4 in the flare vent gas. The
threshold  sensitivity  and  uncertainty  of  this  measurement  is  derived
from the threshold sensitivity of the onboard sensors to CH4  and CO2
[78],  along  with  the  statistical  variability  of  the  concentration  en-
hancements measured from the set of transects.

A wide range of CE and/or DRE values for upstream flares have been
measured  by  airborne  sampling  studies  in  various  regions,  reflecting
both  the  uncertainty  endemic  to  the  measurement  technique  and,
especially, the inherent variability of the underlying regional distribu-
tion. One of the earliest airborne surveys was conducted by Caulton et al.
[78], who estimated DRECH4  from 10 upstream flares in North Dakota
(Bakken  formation)  and  one  in  Pennsylvania  (Marcellus  formation)
using an aircraft equipped with a CRDS. The aircraft was flown directly
into the flare plume and over the flares, parallel to the wind direction.
They estimated the DRE of each plume using Eq. (13) based on the en-
hancements of CH4  and CO2  relative to their backgrounds at multiple
points  per  transect  and  for  multiple  transects.  They  derived  an
enhancement  factor  by  plotting  [ÎCH4]  versus  [ÎCO2],  performing  a
linear regression through zero, and taking the slope. Finally, they con-
verted the enhancement factor into a DRE estimate through Eq. (13).
Caulton et al. reported significant statistical variability in the enhance-
ment factors for each flare but found the DREs to all be larger than 99.8
% with a claimed quantification limit of 99.99 % due to the challenge of
measuring  [ÎCO2]  [78].  The  enhancement  factors,  and  therefore  the
DRE, dropped with increasing crosswind speed in a nonlinear manner,
although  the  authors  estimated  the  overall  effect  on  the  DRE  to  be
negligible due to the large overall DRE. The authors comment that the
difference in height between the flight altitude (~150 m above ground
level, AGL) and the flare stacks (~9 m AGL) had a negligible effect on
the wind  speed experienced by the flare versus that measured by the
plane, especially given the relatively flat terrain. However, this differ-
ence is a potential source of uncertainty in the instrument model.

Gvakharia et al. [43] surveyed 37 flares in the Bakken region for BC,
CH4, and C2H6 using an aircraft equipped with a CRDS and a TDLAS to
measure gas-phase species and a single particle soot photometer (SP2)
system  for  measuring  PM.  Measurements  were  conducted  at  approxi-
mately 400â600 m AGL, with a few measurements at 1000 m AGL. Once
identified  and  verified  using  wind  direction,  flaring  volume,  and  dis-
tance of the plume from the well, flare plumes were measured by circling
the flare on the order of hundreds of meters to a kilometer downwind to
allow  the  flare  sufficient  time  to  disperse  and  to  extend  the  transect
measurement  time  to  provide  a  more  clearly  defined  plume  profile
(Fig. 10a). They then determined the DRE in a manner similar to Caulton
et  al.  [78],  although  Gvakharia  et  al.  [43]  only  considered  the  peak
enhancements  for  each  plume  transect  versus  the  multiple  points  per
transect used by Caulton et al. [78].

The Gvakharia et al. [43] study confirms the same weak dependence
of flare efficiency on crosswind speed as observed by Caulton et al. [78].
However,  it also finds a  lower and more broadly distributed  DRECH4,
with a median between 96 and 97 % and a strong lognormal distribu-
tion, highlighting the disproportionate effect on overall flare emissions
of a minority of flares having much lower DREs than the median. Gva-
kharia  et  al.  [43]  speculate  that  the  difference  between  their

observations and those of Caulton et al. [78] is due mainly to the fact
that  fewer  plumes  were  sampled  during  the  earlier  study,  so  the
important âtailâ of the lognormal distribution may have been missed.

Plant et al. [28] conducted the most comprehensive airborne sam-
pling of upstream flares to date, consisting of over 600 transects of more
than 300 individual flares across the Permian, Eagle Ford, and Bakken
formations.  This  study  used  a  similar  instrument  suite  as  previous
studies  [43,78].  The  aircraft  transected  the  plumes  at  low  altitude,
typically  between  200  and  2000  m  downwind  of  the  flare,  and  then
obtained DRE using Eq. (13), with CO2  and CH4  enhancements deter-
mined  from  concentration  readings  at  each  intercept  (peak)  in  the
transect. They confirmed the lognormal distribution of DRE among lit
flares as reported by Gvakharia et al. [43]; the median value across all
basins was 98 %, while the mean value was 95 % owing to the long tail of
the underlying distribution. Confidence intervals of approximately Â±1
% were found through a bootstrap resampling of the measurements. This
figure contrasts with the 98 % DRE figure that has long been assumed
based on early large-scale extractive flare tests [25â27,57]. Plant et al.
also reported  many  unlit flares;  accounting  for  the  CH4  emitted  from
these flares lowered the effective mean DRE to 91 %. In contrast to the
earlier  studies,  Plant  et  al.  did  not  observe  a  statistically  significant
relationship between wind speed and DRE [28].

While  several  campaigns  have  been  conducted  to  measure  VOC
emissions from offshore oil and gas facilities in the North Sea [79â82], to
date  only  Shaw  et  al.  [21]  have  concurrently  measured  CO2  concen-
trations to estimate CE and DRE (assuming a flare vent gas composition),
along with BC and NOx concentrations. These authors noted that earlier
shipborne measurements targeting CH4 may have failed to capture flare
emissions, which are buoyant and rise into the atmosphere. This study
sampled 58 plumes from offshore platforms in the North Sea using an
aircraft  equipped  with  CRDS  (CO2,  CH4),  TDLAS  (C2H6)  and  custom
chemiluminescence  sensors  to  measure  NOx.  Flare  CE  was  estimated
based on the peak enhancements of CO2, CH4, and C2H6 concentrations
in the plume relative to the background,

CE =

[ÎCO2]
[ÎCO2] + [ÎCO] + 2[ÎC2H6]

(14)

while DRECH4  and DREC2H6  were defined in a manner consistent with
Eq. (13). However, rather than conducting a linear regression between
co-located  components,  Shaw  et  al.  [21]  considered  time-  (or  path-)
integrated  concentration  enhancements,  which  they  argued  are  less
sensitive to temporal misalignments in the species concentration mea-
surements compared to the practice of regressing pairs of [ÎCO2] and
[ÎCH4]  measurements  that  are  supposedly  spatially  co-located.  They
reported  mean  and  median  CE  values  of  97.9  %  and  98.4  %,  respec-
tively,  with  some  evidence  of  a  strongly  skewed  distribution.  Corre-
sponding mean and median DRECH4  values were 97.6 % and 98.5 %,
respectively. These values are consistent with those reported by Plant
et al. [28] and Gvakharia et al. [43] but are lower than those reported by
Caulton  et  al.  [78].  Like  Plant  et  al.  [28],  Shaw  et  al.  [21]  found  no
statistically significant relationship between wind speed and CE for wind
speeds  up  to  15  m/s.  Finally,  Shaw  et  al.  found  that  NOx  production
increases linearly with CE, as one would expect since higher CE would
likely lead to higher flame temperatures and more NOx  production via
the thermal pathway [21].

The accuracy of the CE/DRE values obtained from airborne sampling
hinges on the assumptions that the plume is well mixed and steady and
that it originates only from the flare; if these conditions are satisfied, the
ratio of concentration enhancements measured with the aircraft repre-
sents emissions from the plume. As noted by Gvakharia et al., a major
challenge is the ability to discern CO2  enhancements relative to back-
ground concentration, which impacts the uncertainty of high CE/DRE
estimates [43]. Accordingly, the transect distance should be far enough
downwind  to  provide  a  clear  plume  profile,  but  close  enough  to  be
within  the  noise  threshold  of  the  CO2  concentration  measurement.

Gvakharia et al. also stated that it would be difficult to distinguish DRE
measurements greater than 99 % due to the noise threshold on the CO2
concentration  measurement  [43].  Plant  et  al.  further  examined  the
impact of inert CO2 that may be present in the flare gas and products of
incomplete combustion and found that both these effects may lead to
errors of approximately 0.1 % [28].

A key conclusion that may be drawn from airborne surveys of up-
stream flares is that flare CE and DRE in each region exhibit wide dis-
tributions, with poorly performing flares having a pronounced effect on
overall  emissions.  When  the  QOI  is  the  mean  or  median  flare  perfor-
mance, the contrast between the results of Caulton et al. [78], Gvakharia
et  al.  [43],  and  Plant  et  al.  [28]  highlight  that  a  leading  uncertainty
source  is  likely  to  be  sampling  error.  Accordingly,  the  true  environ-
mental  impact  of  upstream  flaring  can  only  be  understood  through
large-scale  measurement  campaigns.  In  this  regard,  while  airborne
sampling may have a lower sensitivity compared to near-field sampling
measurements, it is ideally suited to measuring large numbers of flares
over wide geographic areas, exemplifying our assertion that there is no
âone-size-fits-allâ solution to measuring flare performance.

3.2. Remote-sensing approaches

In  general,  remote-sensing  measurements  involve  inferring  the
plume  composition  (or,  specifically,  estimating  the  CE/DRE)  through
stand-off  radiometric  measurements.  There  are  clear  advantages  to
stand-off  measurement  techniques,  particularly  given  the  challenges
inherent to sampling the plume gases directly. Stand-off measurements
are  also  safer,  potentially  less  expensive, more  amenable  to  fenceline
monitoring, and may permit automated, continuous monitoring of flare
performance. Information about wind  speed and direction needed for
data  interpretation  and  processing  is  typically  collected  using  an
anemometer.

Table 2 summarizes the remote-sensing techniques that have been
used to characterize flare emissions. In general, they may be categorized
by (1) how the optical path is defined; (2) whether the measurement is
made along a single LOS or is image-based; (3) whether the radiation

section and are consequently difficult to use. The inset highlights the Lorentzian

source is active or passive; and (4) the portion of the electromagnetic
spectrum targeted by the approach and the degree of spectral resolution.
In general, passive approaches are desirable since they are simpler, less
expensive and require less physical access to the flare. It should be noted
that many of the instruments used to measure the analytes described in
Sec. 3.1 are also based on radiometric principles (e.g., CRDS, TDLAS),
but we view these as distinct since they are not deployed on the plume
directly.

Stand-off  radiometric  techniques  are  based  on  spectrally  resolved
intensity  measurements  made  on  either  the  flame  or  the  hot  plume
gases.  In  the  former  category,  QOIs  are  inferred  indirectly  through
correlations  between  the  QOI  and  observable  parameters  like  flame
temperature,  flame  area,  and  flame  shape  that  are  derived  using  re-
ported flaring volumes and âcalibrationâ  measurements done through
extractive sampling or CFD. Radiometric measurements on the plume
gases,  in  contrast,  provide  a  more  direct  connection  to  the  gas-phase
species emitted by the flare.

blackbody intensity, and IÎ·,bg is the background intensity from the sky,
the ground, or some other boundary at s = 0, with s = L denoting the
sensor aperture. An example configuration for measuring the intensity
from a flare plume is shown in Fig. 11.

The  absorption  coefficient,  ÎºÎ·(s),  is  the  sum  of  the  absorption  co-
efficients for the individual components, which may be written in terms
of their mole fractions and molecular spectral absorption cross-sections
(e.g., m2/molecule),

where kB  is Boltzmannâs constant, pg  is the ambient gas pressure, T(s)
and yk(s) are the local temperature and mole fraction of the kth species at
location s, and CÎ·,abs,k(s) is the absorption cross-section, which also de-
pends on temperature. Radiometric measurements made on the plume
exploit the fact that the plume species of interest, including CO2, CO, and
HCs,  have  distinct  absorption  features  over  infrared  wavelengths/
wavenumbers that arise from transitions in vibrational-rotational (VR)
energy states of the molecule. These transitions depend on the unique
spacing of the quantized energy levels of the molecule, so the spectral
absorption  coefficient  ÎºÎ·  acts  like  a  âfingerprintâ  for  each  species.
Therefore, the spectral intensity may be leveraged to identify species in
the flare plume and to develop a quantitative estimate of the amount of
each species along the corresponding LOS using cross-sections computed
using a spectral line database (e.g., HITRAN [83]) or empirically derived
reference spectra [84]. Example absorption spectra for these species are
shown in Fig. 12.

Equation (16) may be extended to include broadband emission and
absorption  by  soot  in  both  the  flame  and  the  flare  plume.  The  local
absorption coefficient of soot, ÎºÎ·,soot(s), may be related to the local soot
volume fraction, fv(s), by

ÎºÎ·,soot(s) = 6ÏE(m)fv(s)Î·

negligible  for  the  infrared  wavelengths  and  pathlengths  used  in  these  di-
agnostics, except in the case of differential absorption LiDAR (DIAL).

where  E(m)  is  the  wavenumber-dependent  absorption  function  [85].
Broadband  contributions  from  soot  particles  tend  to  dominate  the
emission spectra of luminous flames, especially diffusion flares typical of
upstream oil and gas operations. Consequently, the emission spectrum of
the visible flame can often be modeled as a blackbody, which facilitates
calculation of a pyrometric flame temperature. The broadband contri-
bution of soot tends to be much lower in the flare plume downstream of
the flame since much of the soot oxidizes within the flame region.

3.2.1. Satellite-based approaches

While  satellite-based  sensors  cannot  measure  flare  CE  or  DRE
directly, they play a critical role in assessing global flaring activities and
flare  gas  volumes  and  thus  merit  discussion.  Satellite  platforms  are
particularly useful for providing a global perspective on flaring activity,
and, unlike other remote-sensing approaches, they are not constrained
by property boundaries and geopolitical borders. Recent surveys of the
state-of-the-art  in  satellite-based  flare  measurements  are  provided  by
Faruilo et al. [86] and Anejionu [87].

Flares may be observed using a suite of satellite-based sensors that
measure irradiance over multiple bands across the visible and infrared
spectra.  These  include  NOAAâs  Visible  Infrared  Imaging  Radiometer
Suite  (VIIRS),  NASAâs  Moderate  Resolution  Imaging  Spectrometer
(MODIS), and, most recently, the ESAâs Sentinal-3 Sea and Land Surface
Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR). Potential flares may be identified as
âhot  spotsâ  through  multispectral  image  analysis  over  visible  and
infrared  wavelengths.  Once  identified,  the  flame  temperature  is  esti-
mated  through  Planckâs  law  by  comparing  intensities  measured  at
multiple  channels;  flares  are  distinguished  from  other  incandescent
sources  (e.g.,  biomass  combustion)  based  on  their  temperature.  Flare
measurements are made at night because the sensors are more sensitive
compared to daytime operation and solar-induced confounding effects
are avoided, although increasingly sophisticated sensors and data pro-
cessing may enable daytime detection of flares under some conditions
[88]. Satellite infrared imaging sensors have a spatial resolution much
larger than the size of the visible flame (e.g., on the order of ~70 m for
VIIRS). Consequently, the observed pixel intensity is usually composed
of flare and background irradiance; these contributions may be distin-
guished from each other through multispectral sensing. Spatial resolu-
tion  may  be  enhanced  by  combining  the  nighttime  observation  with
synthetic aperture radar [89] or high-resolution daytime imaging [88].
It is worth noting that satellite-based sensors cannot observe unlit flares
or enclosed combustors. Unlit flares are a particularly important source
of GHG emissions from upstream oil and gas activities [28,46].

Flares were first observed from space in the 1970s [90,91] and 1980s
[92]; these observations motivated a second-generation of intentional
research focused on identifying flares, starting in the mid-1980s [93].
While early studies estimated flaring activity based on the numbers of
flares in a given area, more sophisticated multispectral analysis may be
used to estimate flare gas volumes in one of two ways: empirical models
developed by correlating satellite-observed quantities (e.g., flame tem-
perature or radiance) with flaring volumes reported by producers [93,
94], or physiochemical models that account for the heating value of the
fuel,  flare  CE/DRE,  and  radiant  fraction  (the  portion  of  combustion
enthalpy converted to thermal emission) [95,96]. In both techniques BC
and greenhouse gas emission estimates derived from satellite imagery
require specification of flare CE or DRE and not vice versa [96], high-
lighting  the  need  for  the  measurement  techniques  reviewed  in  this
study. In the case of large flares, however, Schade speculates that it may
be possible to exploit a correlation between flare temperature and CE,
reasoning that CE scales inversely with flame temperature [97]. Were
this  approach  viable,  it  would  rely  on  âmicro-scaleâ  calibrations  be-
tween satellite data and CE or DRE measurements made locally [97]. A
similar  observation  is  made  by  Caseiro  et  al.,  who  reason  that  flare
temperatures close  to  the  adiabatic flame  temperature  imply that the
flare is highly efficient [96].

Another approach is to combine visible and infrared emission mea-
surements  made  mainly  at  night  with  daytime  observations  of  back-
scattered sunlight, which may be used to infer column densities of NO2,
CH4,  aerosols,  and  other  pollutant  species  of  interest.  The  Ozone
Monitoring  Instrument  (OMI)  [98],  and  more  recently  TROPOMI
(TROPOSPspheric  Monitoring  Instrument)  [88],  launched  in  2004  in
2017, respectively, are particularly useful in this regard. However, the
low spatial resolution of these sensors (on the order of 20 km for OMI
and  5  km  for  TROPOMI)  means  that  emissions  may  be  attributed  to
flaring activities at the gas field or facility level, but not to individual
flares.

3.2.2. Open-path FTIR spectroscopy

At  the  time  of  writing,  open-path  FTIR  spectroscopy  is  the  most
widely used stand-off technique for measuring flare CE or DRE. In this
approach, a telescope-equipped FTIR spectrometer measures the spec-
tral intensity along an LOS that transects the flare plume at a prescribed
location relative to the flare tip or visible flame. The measured spectrum
is then used to infer species column number densities, and the CE may be
found  via  Eq.  (6).  A  similar  column-density-based  definition  may  be
used to infer a DRE.

A dedicated prototype for measuring flare plumes was developed in
1984  by  Industrial  Monitor  and  Control  Corporation  (IMACC)  and
subsequently refined through field deployments in 2003 and 2009, as
well  as  the  TCEQ  measurement  campaign  in  2010  [48,68].  In  2000,
Blackwood  used open-path FTIR measurements  to infer  the DRECO  of
two flares simultaneously [99]. The technique was also proposed inde-
pendently by Haus et al. [27], who used their instrument to measure
concentrations of CH4, CO2, CO, NO and H2O in natural gas flares in
Europe.

Fourier transform infrared spectrometers convert a beam of broad-
band  light  into  a  resolved  spectrum  through  interferometry.  Light
entering the spectrometer aperture is split into two paths: one path is
terminated  by  a  fixed  mirror,  while  the  other  is  terminated  by  an
oscillating  mirror. The  reflected  beams  are  then  recombined,  and  the
resulting intensity measured using a detector. Plotting the intensity as a
function of mirror displacement produces an oscillating pattern called
an  interferogram  that  conveys  wavelength-dependent  information
through  the  constructive  and  destructive  wave  interference  patterns,
which depend on the difference in optical paths (mirror position) and
wavelength.  Finally,  the  interferogram  is  Fourier-transformed  into  an
intensity spectrum. The measured spectrum amounts to a convolution of
the true intensity and an instrument lineshape function (ILS) that de-
termines the spectral resolution and depends on the maximum mirror
displacement (maximum optical path difference, MOPD). The spectral
resolution/MOPD  must  be  adjusted  to  provide  a  trade-off  between
spectral resolution and acquisition time/temporal resolution.

The IMACC instrument is typically operated at a spectral resolution
(cid:0) 1,  sufficient  to  resolve  key  absorption  lines,  and  uses  data
of  0.5  cm
(cid:0) 1) and 8â15 Î¼m (1250
collected over both the 3â5 Î¼m (2000 to 3000 cm
(cid:0) 1) atmospheric windows, which are relatively free of water
to 650 cm
lines.  Spectra  are  integrated  over  1-min  intervals  [69]  and  may  be
further  averaged  over  time,  e.g.,  over  15  min  [68],  to  improve  the
signal-to-noise ratio. The IMACC procedure is to aim the telescope âone
visible flame length awayâ from the visible flame tip [69], as shown in
Fig. 3, reasoning that at this location the reactants in the flare vent gas
have  been  consumed  completely.  Ideally  the  optical  path  is  defined
perpendicular to the wind direction, so that the plume may be modeled
as homogeneous. The Cassegrain telescope used in the IMACC instru-
ment has a divergence of 0.5 mrad, so a measurement made 100 m away
from the plume corresponds to a spot diameter of 30 cm.

The  measured  intensity  spectra  are  then  interpreted  using  an  in-
strument model that accounts for the ILS and a âtwo-slabâ spectroscopic
model. By assuming the plume to be homogeneous in composition and
temperature, Eq. (15) simplifies to

plume  and  ÏÎ·,plume  are  the  plume  emittance  and  transmittance  respec-
tively, and ÏÎ·,atm is the transmittance of the atmospheric layer between
the plume and the sensor. Plume transmittance is related to the species
concentrations in the plume through

where L is the plume thickness and nâ²k is the column number density of
the kth species (molecules/m2). The plume emittance is related to the
plume transmittance by Kirchhoffâs law, ÎµÎ·,plume = 1(cid:0) ÏÎ·,plume [85].

Open-path FTIR measurements may be conducted in either âpassiveâ
or âactiveâ  modes. In passive (PFTIR) mode, the optical path is âopen
ended,â so that IÎ·,bg is that of the sky. Background intensity is found by
comparing intensity measurements made through the plume and outside
of the plume, while ÏÎ·,atm  is obtained by measuring the spectrum of a
blackbody calibration source located at a similar distance away from the
instrument.  The  plume  temperature,  Tplume,  is  calculated  from
temperature-sensitive  features  of  the  absorption  spectrum,  e.g.,  a
(cid:0) 1 CO band
Boltzmann plot of the âhot linesâ at the wings of the 2150 cm
[69]. Finally, the path-integrated species concentrations are found by
regressing a modeled plume transmittance, Eq. (19), to the one inferred
from the FTIR intensity spectrum.

In  âactiveâ  (AFTIR)  mode,  the  optical  path  through  the  plume  is
terminated by an active light source or retroreflector. Haus et al. used a
steady  infrared  light  source  (globar)  [27],  while  the  IMACCS  AFTIR
instrument  combines  a  time-modulated  light  source  and  FTIR  into  a
single  transceiver  unit  and  terminates  the  path  with  a  retroreflector
behind  the  plume.  The  modulation  is  used  to  isolate  the  transmitted
portion  of  the  spectrum  (âACâ  component)  from  the  emission  and
background (âDCâ components), thereby avoiding additional calibration
steps [68]. The recovered plume transmittance is less sensitive to un-
certain background spectra (which can be complex on a cloudy or partly
cloudy day). Also, since the absorption term in Eq. (18) is nearly inde-
pendent of the local plume temperature, this approach avoids the model
error  introduced  by  approximating  the  plume  as  isothermal  and  well
mixed,  which  is  necessary  when  modeling  the  emitted  contributions.
Blackwood used a retroreflector to characterize the DREs of two flare
plumes simultaneously [99]. The performance of the individual flares
was distinguished by adding inert tracer gases (CF4  or SF6) to the fuel
stream of each flare, both of which are strongly participating and easily
detected by the FTIR. While AFTIR is regarded as more sensitive and
accurate than PFTIR, the challenge of suspending a globar or retrore-
flector  behind  the  flare  plume  renders  it  impractical  except  during
dedicated, large-scale testing.

A special class of AFTIR called solar occultation flux uses the sun as
an  active  source.  Mellqvist  [100]  applied  this  technique  to  measure
ethylene (C2H4) emitted by two steam-assisted flares at a polyethylene
plant  and  then  estimated  CE.  The  solar  FTIR  was  connected  to  a  sun
tracker, and this system was mounted on the roof of a vehicle that moved
along a transect 200 m from the plume and roughly parallel to the wind
direction. Because the background (solar) intensity was large relative to
IÎ·,b(Tplume) and IÎ·,b(Tatm), the emission term in Eq. (18) was neglected,
resulting in the species column density depending directly on the plume
opacity,  ln(IÎ·,bg/IÎ·,L).  Mellqvist  found  ethylene  column  densities  by
fitting modeled absorptance spectra that accounted for C2H4, H2O, and
NH3  to the  measured  spectra.  He then  combined these  densities  with
simultaneous anemometry measurements to obtain C2H4 emission rates
(kg/h).  Because  this  technique  only  targeted  C2H4  in  the  plume,  the

supply rate needed to find CE. Instead, N2O was used as a tracer gas and
introduced into the flare gas stream at a known rate; the dilution relative
to  C2H4  was  measured  further  downstream  using  a  separate  FTIR.
Mellqvist [100] found the CE to vary between 50 % and 97 %, with low
CE  values  corresponding  to  high  steam-to-C2H4  ratios  and  low  flow
rates.

A key advantage of FTIR-based approaches is the ability to finger-
print and quantify a wide range of species. As an example, in 2014 the
US EPA deployed the IMACC PFTIR instrument and Telops MWIR im-
aging Fourier transform spectrometer (IFTS) (Sec. 3.2.3) to measure the
CE  of  EGCs  via  Eq.  (7) [72].  The  PFTIR  instrument  provided  column
densities (ppmâm) of C4H10, C2H2, C3H6, CH4, CO, CO2, H2O, NO, and
NO2  within  the  exhaust  plumes.  The  EGC  plumes  are  a  particularly
challenging  target  compared  to  flares  due  to  their  lower  temperature
and heterogeneity.

There  are  several  challenges  inherent  to  open-path  FTIR  that
contribute  to  uncertainty  in  measured  CE  and  DRE.  While  CO2  is
abundant in flare plumes as a combustion product, it is also present in
the atmosphere and, depending on the stand-off distance and the con-
centration  and  temperature  of  the  CO2  in  the  flare  plume,  it  may  be
difficult to calculate the CO2  column density accurately. As shown in
Fig.  13,  CO2  in  the  flare  plume  is  only  detectable  based  on  the
(cid:0) 1  band,
temperature-sensitive âhot linesâ at the wings of the 2325 cm
which  appear  as  âspikesâ  on  either  side  of  the  band;  the  center  is
completely absorbed by the atmospheric layer between the plume and
the camera.

Most  importantly,  the  assumption  of  a  temporally  steady  and
spatially homogeneous plume that underlies this technique may not be
generally applicable, as discussed in Secs. 2.2.2 and 2.2.3. Wormholdt
et  al.  [68]  compared  CE  estimates  derived  from  PFTIR  and
extractive-sampling  measurements  during  the  2010  TCEQ  tests.  They
found PFTIR-derived values to match those determined from extractive
sampling  within specified error bars at high CE but saw  greater vari-
ability and larger differences between these methods at lower CE, when
the  flare  may  be  âsputteringâ.  This  was  particularly  the  case  for
over-steamed  flares  and  was  attributed  to  greater  plume
in-
homogeneities  under  these  operating  conditions.  Propylene-fueled
flares  exhibited  the  largest  differences  between  PFTIR  and  extractive
CE  estimates;  possible  reasons  included  challenges  inherent  in
measuring propylene in the extracted sample, errors in the spectroscopic
model used to analyze the PFTIR data, cold fuel that was undetected by
the PFTIR instrument, plume inhomogeneity, or some combination of
these factors. Wormholdt et al. [68] also observed that fluctuations in

individual species column densities were much larger than fluctuations
in CE estimates since species column densities were highly temporally
correlated.  They  argue  that  this  makes  open-path,  FTIR-inferred  CE
estimates more robust compared to individual column density estimates,
although this finding conflicts with Seymour and Johnsonâs observation
that  the  BC  and  H2O  column  densities  in  a  flare  plume  were  not
temporally correlated [59] (Sec. 2.2.3/Fig. 7).

Even for flares operated at high CE, it is not clear that open-path FTIR
would be capable of capturing the fuel-rich region beneath the plume
that may arise from fuel stripping, as is visible in Fig. 3a. First, the FTIR
LOS  is  aligned  immediately  downstream  of  the  visible  flame  tip  to
capture the hot plume gases from the combustion region but not beneath
the visible flame, where the colder, more dense stripped fuel is likely to
accumulate. Second, the cold fuel region may not have sufficient ther-
mal contrast with the background to be visible (Fig. 3b). Given that the
performance  of  open-path  FTIR  methods  are  validated  by  extractive
sampling conducted downstream of the flare plume and not beneath it
(Fig. 9), both PFTIR and extractive sampling approaches may system-
atically overestimate flare CE.

3.2.3. Whole-plume imaging techniques

The main drawback of open-path FTIR is that its narrow field-of-view
may lead to strongly biased CE or DRE estimates in the case of hetero-
geneous plumes. This limitation motivated development of whole-plume
imaging techniques, which infer CE or DRE based on images of the flare
plume viewed in profile. All whole-plume imaging techniques generate
images  having  some  degree  of  spectral  resolution.  Most  approaches
(cid:0) 1),  which
focus  on  the  MWIR  spectrum  (3â5  Î¼m,  3333-2000  cm
contains  VR  bands  for  CO2,  CO,  and  HCs,  and,  importantly,  excludes
strong H2O lines that are not of interest and could obscure or confound
measurement  of  the  species  needed  to  estimate  CE,  although  recent
research has explored the viability of hyperspectral imagers that operate
over the long-wavelength infrared (LWIR) spectrum [101].

Multispectral cameras based on uncooled âwarmâ filters placed over
the instrument aperture cannot be used to develop quantitative CE or
DRE  estimates,  since  blackbody  emission  from  the  opaque  portion  of
these filters would dominate the part of the signal from the flare plume.
This consideration limits the candidate equipment that may be used to
estimate CE or DRE to specialized instruments that have only become
commercially available within the last decade.

3.2.3.1. Light-field and line-scan cameras. In 2012 Zeng et al. [102,103]
proposed a technique called âvideo imaging spectro-radiometryâ (VISR)
based on a multispectral camera containing four measurement bands of

spectrally  integrated  intensity:  one  each  for  CO2  (4.2â4.3  Î¼m),  CO
(4.7â4.8  Î¼m),  HCs  (3â4  Î¼m),  and  a  background  measurement.  They
derived  an  instrument  model  for  a  pixel-wise,  local  CE  measurement
from  the  set  of  measured intensities  obtained  by  integrating  over  the
particular wavelength band. The spectral intensities are related to the
column densities through spectrally averaged absorption cross-sections
using a simplified version of the slab model used for open-path FTIR.
By assuming that IÎ·,bg is negligible compared to the emission term and
approximating the plume emittance by a first-order Taylor series (the
âoptically thinâ approximation [85]), Eq. (18) simplifies to

the plume and the camera. By solving Eq. (21) for the molecular column
density,  nkâ²,  and  approximating  the  blackbody  intensity  as  uniform
across all four channels, the pixel-wise local CE, Eq. (7), can be written
in terms of the pixel intensities

Nominally, Sk,j  depends on both local number density and the temper-
ature  along  each  LOS;  however,  by  assuming  that  the  blackbody  in-
tensity  is  the  same  for  all  channels  and  by  calculating  the  molecular
absorption  cross-section at  a  ârepresentativeâ  plume  temperature, the
local CE for each pixel can be approximated without knowing the plume
temperature. The local CE estimates from Eq. (22) are converted to an
overall flare CE, e.g., Eq. (1), by averaging the local CE values for pixels

VISR method and extractive methods for steam- and air-assisted flares, reported

immediately outside of the flame envelope [63]. A key benefit of this
simplified radiometric model is that flare CE estimates may be generated
in real-time, without the post-processing required for other techniques.
One of the main challenges in VISR lies in generating simultaneous
plume  images  over  different  spectra  without  using  warm  filters,  i.e.,
filters  placed  in  front  of  the  camera  aperture,  since  the  blackbody
emission from the opaque portion of the filter would otherwise dominate
the transmitted radiation from the plume species. In their original white
paper [102] and patent [103], Zeng et al. suggested using a light-field
multispectral  camera,  within  which  a  microlens  array  projects
âcopiesâ  of  the  image  onto  a  segmented  focal  plane  array  (FPA).  A
different bandpass filter is mounted immediately in front of each FPA
segment and behind the cold shield of the camera to suppress blackbody
emission from the filters. A similar camera operating over LWIR wave-
lengths has been developed for measuring ambient methane emissions
[104].

This  concept  was  prototyped  using  a  Surface  Optics  Corporation
SOC750  commercial  hyperspectral  (line-scan)  camera  [63].  The  in-
strument imaged 5 or 7 one-pixel-wide strips of the scene (depending on
the  camera  model)  using  prisms.  The  optics  were  moved  to  scan  the
entire image, resulting in a 3D data cube consisting of 42 images, each
integrated over uniform spectral intervals between 2 and 5 Î¼m. For each
experiment, the camera acquired data for 30 s, generating 11 data cubes
per second (256 pixels Ã 240 pixels Ã 42 bands) for a total of 325 cubes
per measurement. These cubes were averaged to reduce measurement
variance, and the single, averaged data cube was used to calculate the
CE [63].

Zeng et al. [63] assessed the accuracy of this technique by comparing
VISR-derived  CE  values  with  those  found  through  plume  sampling,
shown in Fig. 9b, for 28 cases consisting of both steam- and air-assisted
flares. The results of this comparison are plotted in Fig. 14. The average
difference between these datasets was 0.50 % when all data points were
included  and  0.10  %  when  a  subset  of  18  data  points  with  lower  O2
content was considered, rationalizing that the samples were less diluted
and thus more representative of the actual plume composition. Thirteen
of these tests were replicated, and the maximum difference between the
VISR-derived and plume-sampling CE values was 0.2 %, excluding two
outliers. They found greater disagreement between the datasets at low
CE,  with  the  VISR-derived  CE  values  being  larger  than  those  derived
from sampling; indeed, Fig. 14 shows that the regression line does not
intercept the origin for this reason. This finding is similar with the dif-
ference  between  PFTIR-derived  CE  values  and  those  found  through
extractive  sampling  on  similar  flare  types  (Sec.  3.2.2).  In  subsequent
work,  Providence  Photonics  identified  a  âsystematic  negative  bias  of
(cid:0) 0.8 % ... in the VISR results when compared to the extractive resultsâ.
They assumed the extractive results to be correct and adjusted the VISR
instrument model accordingly to remove the bias [105]. Given that the
underlying uncertainty of CE values obtained from near-field extractive
measurements  is  almost  certainly  larger  than  this  discrepancy  (Sec.
3.1.1),  this  treatment  raises  questions  about  the  accuracy  of  the
VISR-derived CE estimates.

Zeng et al. [63] note that the sensitivities of both the radiometer and
the extractive sampler were very close to their threshold HC detection
capabilities at the highest CE values, leading to the scatter shown in the
inset of Fig. 14. These results have been used to justify the claim that this
technique  has  an  âaccuracy  within  0.5  %  [64],  but  a  more  precise
statement  is  that  the  difference  in  CE  values  between  the  VISR  and
extractive  techniques  is  less  than  0.01.  Or,  as  stated  in  Ref.  [105],
âStrictly speaking, what can be assessed is the agreement between the
two methods, not the accuracy of either method because the true flare
CE  is  unknownâ.  The  uncertainties  associated  with  the  limitations
imposed by the choice of camera and by the assumptions used to create
the instrument model have not been analyzed.

While the SOC750 is a convenient, general-purpose, hyperspectral
imager, only a minority of its 42 spectral bins are aligned with VR bands
of the species of interest. Furthermore, the moving components of the

Fig. 15. Schematic of an infrared Fourier transform spectrometer (IFTS). The image entering the aperture is split and directed into two optical paths: one terminated
by a fixed mirror, and the other by a moving mirror. The images are recombined, and the resulting image is attenuated due to wave interference patterns. Traversing
the moving mirror over its full range of motion produces an interferogram data cube that is Fourier-transformed into a spectral-intensity data cube.

(cid:0) 1, along with spectra corresponding to pixels (a) above and (b) within the plume, as well as (c) from the

line-scan  camera  constrain  the  minimum  time  needed  to  generate  an
image. Accordingly, Providence Photonics, Surface Optics Corporation,
and  Zeeco,  Inc.  partnered  to  develop  the  FlareGuardianTM  system;
instead of a line-scan camera, it uses a light-field hyperspectral imager,
which can acquire images at intervals of 33â91 ms. The measurement
spectrum has been reduced to 3â5 Î¼m and divided into a similar number
of bins as the SOC750; however, the bins are distributed nonuniformly
according to the spectral features of the species of interest  (CO, CO2,
HCs). This spectral resolution is sufficient to capture some coarse fea-
tures of the emission spectrum, e.g., the red and blue CO2  spikes, but
inadequate  to  estimate  temperature  or  identify  unburned  or  partially
pyrolyzed species in the flare plume. It may be an important limitation
in the case of downstream flaring, which often involves more complex
fuels,  or  even  in  upstream  flaring  when  the  associated  gas  is  not

dominated  by  one  species.  While  it  may  be  possible  to  develop  a
âmixture-weightedâ spectral absorption cross-section for unburned HCs
when  the  flare  gas  composition  is  known,  this  would  be  impractical
under real-world conditions when the flare gas composition may change
dynamically or when it is unknown. Another drawback of the light-field
camera  is  that  spatial  resolution  is  sacrificed  for  spectral  resolution,
since the FPA must be split into the number of spectral bins.

A further concern pertains to the way in which the local, pixel-wise
CE is averaged to obtain a global CE. Aside from the fact that the âflame
envelopeâ is defined in an ambiguous and heuristic way [63], the global
CE cannot be found by averaging local CE values for reasons discussed in
Sec. 2.2.4. Furthermore, the flame envelope contains pixels on both the
upwind and downwind sides of the flame, while only the combustion
products  leaving  the  flare  should  impact  the  global  CE.  Finally,  it  is

18

unclear whether a technique based purely on emissive spectroscopy can
detect cold HCs beneath the flare plume associated with fuel stripping
(Fig. 3).

SENSIA  recently  introduced  a  commercial  multispectral  system
called Agni-RedLookTM for continuous flare monitoring [75,77]. Like the
FlareGuardianTM, this system claims to provide real-time DRE estimates.
This instrument incorporates two broadband IR cameras containing cold
filters roughly aligned to the absorption bands of HCs (3.2â3.4 Î¼m) and
CO2 (4.2â4.4 Î¼m), like the multispectral concept proposed by Zeng et al.
[102,103].  A  pixel-wise  DRE  estimate  is  then  calculated  based  on
broadband  absorptances,  similar  to  Eq.  (22).  Finally,  an  overall  DRE
value is obtained, although the methodology for this calculation is not
specified. The instrument was demonstrated on two diffusion flares at an
oil and gas site and provided DRE estimates between 97 and 99 % [75].
To the best of our knowledge, this system has yet to be assessed through
rigorous testing, and no uncertainty estimates have been provided at the
present time.

3.2.3.2. Imaging  Fourier  transform  spectrometers  (IFTSs). Other  re-
searchers have used IFTSs to measure flare emissions and to infer flare
CE.  Commercial  MWIR  and  LWIR  IFTSs  were  developed  in  the  mid-
2000s  by  Telops,  Inc.  and  have  been  used  extensively  for  measure-
ments on combustion-generated gas plumes. As shown in Fig. 15, the
IFTS  operates  similarly  to  an  FTIR  spectrometer  in  a  PFTIR  measure-
ment. The image is split into two images by a beam-splitter. One of the
images is reflected off a fixed mirror and the other off a moving one.
Recombining  the  images  produces  an  interferogram  cube,  which  is
Fourier-transformed  into  a  data  cube  containing  hundreds of  spectral
intensity maps, each at a distinct wavenumber. The spectral resolution
(cid:0) 1)  is  lower  than  a  typical  PFTIR  measurement  (0.5
(usually  ~1  cm
(cid:0) 1)  but  much  higher  than  a  light-field  or  line-scan  hyperspectral
cm
(cid:0) 1  near 3.5 Î¼m for the SOC750). An example in-
camera (e.g., ~70 cm
tensity image of a steam-assisted flare is shown in Fig. 16, along with
spectra  for  pixels  above  and  within  the  flare  plume  and  on  the  flare
stack.

As with the PFTIR, the spectra for a subset of pixels are then analyzed
to recover column number densities. Like PFTIR, it is also possible to
identify  species  within  plumes  of  uncertain  composition.  However,
while  the  spectrometer  used  to  conduct  PFTIR  measurements  covers
most of the infrared spectrum (Fig. 13), the IFTS spectral range is usually
much  narrower,  making  species  fingerprinting  more  difficult.  Never-
theless, in the case of Fig. 16, it is possible to identify the HC as butane.
While each interferogram takes ~30 s to assemble, depending on the
spectral resolution, the individual images within the interferogram are
recorded  at  hundreds  of  frames  per  second.  These  images  may  be
normalized and processed using optical flow [106] or image correlation
velocimetry  [107]  algorithms  to  obtain  a  near-instantaneous,  intensi-
ty-weighted velocity field. The column densities and velocities may then
be combined to obtain the species mass flux estimates needed to define
CE.

Computing  this  regression  for  each  pixel  LOS  is  time-consuming,
mainly  due  to  the  expense  of  calculating  the  temperature-dependent
absorption  cross-sections.  Consequently,  rather  than  generating  a  full
2D column density map, column densities may  be computed only for
pixels along one or several âintegration linesâ that define a transecting
plane normal to the image plane, like the one in Fig. 8. Each column
density  is  then  multiplied  by  the  corresponding  velocity  component
normal to the line and the pixel height. Summing over the pixels, we
obtain the mass flow rates needed to calculate CE via Eq. (4).

Savary et al. [108] estimated the emission rates of H2O, CO2, SO2,
and a wide range of HCs from a refinery flare using simultaneous MWIR
(1.5â5.5 Î¼m) and LWIR (8â12 Î¼m) measurements made with two com-
mercial IFTSs. Mass flow rates were then transformed into CE estimates.
Gagnon et al. [109] used a LWIR IFTS to generate SO2 and formaldehyde
(CH2O)  column  density  maps  in  a  flare  plume  but  were  unable  to

measure  CO2  over  this  spectral  range  and  could  not  calculate  CE.
Subsequent studies (e.g., Refs. [110,111]) have mainly focused on the
MWIR instrument, since this wavelength range includes prominent CO2
features needed to quantify CE/DRE and avoids H2O lines that overlap
those of key HCs (Fig. 12). A Telops MWIR IFTS was used to measure the
CE of steam- and air-assisted flares as part of the 2010 TCEQ study [48].
The CE values estimated by the IFTS were, on average, ~15 % lower
than  those  estimated  by  PFTIR  (Sec.  3.2.2)  and  near-field  sampling
measurements (Sec. 3.1.1) [48]. The Telops instrument was less reliable
than the PFTIR and required over six weeks to obtain a CE estimate due
mainly to the enormous amounts of data generated by the instrument
[48].

In a 2014 US EPA study on EGCs [72], the Telops MWIR IFTS was
used to measure benzene, toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene, CO, CO2, H2O,
NO, and N2O in the exhaust plumes. The IFTS was operated at a spectral
(cid:0) 1 using a 128 pixel Ã 128 pixel subdomain of the
resolution of 0.25 cm
FPA. Species concentration maps (ppmâm) revealed a significant degree
of  plume  heterogeneity  (Sec.  2.2.2)  and  emission  bursts  (Sec.  2.2.3).
However, as was the case in the TCEQ study [48], Telops was unable to
transform the large amounts of data generated by IFTS into reliable CE
estimates [72].

Miguel et al. [112] reassessed the potential for estimating flare CE
with  a  MWIR  IFTS  using  a  CFD-LES  model  of  a  flare  in  crosswind,  a
laboratory-scale  heated  vent,  and
laboratory-scale  steam-  and
air-assisted flares. Experimental measurements were carried out using a
Telops  iMW  IFTS  (3â5.4  Î¼m).  IFTS-inferred  CH4  flow  rates  were  in
excellent agreement with the known mass flow rates for the heated vent,
but spectra captured on the lab-scale flare were affected by broadband
emission from soot and some artifacts of unknown origin.

Lapeyre et al. [111] used the same MWIR IFTS to measure the plumes
from a natural gas flare, an EGC, and a steam-assisted flare at a refinery.
Overall, IFTS-inferred carbon mass flow rates for the EGC matched the
fuel supply rate. However, quantitative analysis of both exposed flares
was affected by lens flare artifacts emanating from the hot CO2  in the
combustion region, a common problem in high dynamic range imaging
[113]. These artifacts arise from secondary reflections between the op-
tical components of the camera. Flare plume measurements made using
a LWIR IFTS (Telops mini xLW, 7.4â12.5 Î¼m) were free of this artifact
[101],  since  the  spectral  absorption  cross-section  of  CO2  over  this
wavelength range is much smaller compared to the other species of in-
terest (Fig. 12).

To the best of our knowledge, there has yet to be a rigorous quan-
tification of the uncertainties of the CE/DRE values obtained from an
IFTS or of the underlying mass flow rates used in Eq. (4). The uncertainty
in the mass flow rates arises from at least two sources: uncertainties in
the  column  densities  found  by  inverting  the  radiometric  model,  and
uncertainties in the projected velocity field used to convert the column
densities into a mass flow rate. Both Miguel et al. [110] and Lapeyre
et al. [111] benchmarked the performance of the IFTS by quantifying
CO2 and CH4 mass flow rates from a heated vent. The IFTS-derived mass
flow rates were generally within 10 % of the imposed mass flow rates.
This  level  of  accuracy  is  representative  of  what  one  may  expect  by
combining  column  densities  with  an  intensity-weighted  projected  ve-
locity field [114]. If these mass flow rates were used to derive the CE via
Eq.  (4),  the  corresponding  uncertainty  would  be  smaller  because  the
mass flow rate errors are correlated by the velocity field (i.e., the same
velocity field is used to calculate the two mass flow rates, so the errors
âcancel outâ to some extent.)

The  uncertainties  in  the  column-density  values  depend  on  the
sensitivity  of  the  IFTS-measured  spectra  to  the  species  in  the  plume,
which in turn are functions of the spectral resolution, the presence of
other plume species that also absorb and emit over the same spectrum,
the transmittance of the atmosphere between the plume and the IFTS,
and,  especially,  the  parameterization  of  the  temperature  and  species
concentration  along  each  LOS.  Neglecting  the  fluctuations  in  these
values, which couple in a nonlinear way, is an additional error in the

19

instrument model.

A further issue concerns scene-change artifacts (SCAs), which arise
from turbulent fluctuations in the gas concentrations and temperature as
the  underlying  interferogram  is  being  constructed.  These  fluctuations
become conflated with amplitude fluctuations induced by the interfer-
ometer and manifest as broadband artifacts in the spectrum. The SCAs
may  be  removed  either  by  median  filtering  a  large  set  of  data  cubes
[115], further limiting the time resolution of the data, or by bandpass
filtering the interferograms themselves [116].

Finally, at the present time, IFTS analysis cannot provide detailed,
real-time CE estimates due to the computational expense of solving for
the unknown-species column densities. Therefore, while IFTSs may be
useful for dedicated measurement campaigns that target specific flares,
they are not suitable for stand-alone, continuous monitoring of a flare.
And, as already noted, the large amount of data generated by the IFTS is
both a blessing and a curse. In principle an IFTS data cube may be used
to fingerprint unknown species and map species column densities over
the entire image, but storing and processing the large amounts of data
generated by the instrument is challenging. This barrier is diminishing
with  rapid  advancements  in  solid-state  and  cloud  data  storage,  high-
performance computing, and expert systems/artificial intelligence.

3.2.3.3. Challenges to whole-plume imaging. There are several challenges
inherent to whole-plume imaging. Foremost is the question of whether
the image captures the key plume components. As already noted, many
of the plume imaging techniques are based on MWIR imaging since this
spectral range avoids emissions from hot water generated through the
combustion process. The drawback in this wavelength range is that, due
to the lower spectral intensity of colder plume components, it may not
be possible to image stripped fuel that was diverted from the combustion
zone.  More  generally,  the  high  dynamic  range  of  the  image  makes  it
difficult to capture all the species of interest. Hot CO2  is also far more
abundant  than  unburned  HCs,  and  temperatures  vary  significantly
throughout the plume. Broadband emissions from soot may also lead to
image saturation.

A  further  complication  concerns  crosswinds.  Most  plume  imaging
techniques assume that the image plane is parallel to the plume/wind
direction, as shown in Fig. 11. In reality, practical limitations of plume
access and wind shifts during the measurement may impact the calcu-
lation. Under these conditions, one would expect the true plume chord
length to be longer than the one inferred from the image plane, while the
velocity  measured  through  feature-tracking  would  be  lower  than  the
true  velocity.  These  effects  roughly  cancel  out,  as  demonstrated  by
Johnson et al. when calculating soot emission rates from flares [45]. A
more  complex  question  concerns  wind  variability,  particularly  for
âlong-exposureâ techniques like the IFTS. To the best of our knowledge,

a systematic analysis of the impact of variable wind on flare gas-phase
emission measurements remains to be conducted.

3.2.4. Visible flame spectroscopy

A major drawback of whole-plume imaging techniques is that they
require costly and specialized equipment to capture the MWIR or LWIR
spectra needed to fingerprint and quantify the plume species directly. An
alternative  approach  is  to  image  the  flame  over  visible  wavelengths
using less expensive equipment and then correlate these images to the
CE or DRE. For example, as already noted in Sec. 3.2.1, there is an ex-
pected relationship between flame brightness and CE as hotter flames
tend to be more efficient. Since the visible appearance of the flame is
only indirectly connected to the plume composition, these techniques
are  all  âdata-drivenâ  and  rely  on  training  data  obtained  through
extractive measurements or CFD simulations.

Casi Ìneira  et  al.  [74]  proposed  a  multiwavelength  image  analysis
(MIA) technique based on simultaneous flame images recorded over the
red, blue, and green channels of a visible camera. They used a principal
component analysis  to reduce  the images into candidate feature vari-
ables that included the area of the luminous region, peak flame bright-
ness,  uniformity  of  flame  brightness,  and  average  brightness  of  the
nonluminous area. These features became the basis of a regressive model
for flame CE.

This technique was developed using half of a set of simulated RGB
images  generated  from  CFD-LES  models  of  six  wind-tunnel  diffusion
flares from Johnson and  Kostiuk  [53]. The predictive  performance of
the partial least squares (PLS) regression model was assessed using the
other  half  of  the  simulated  data.  Casi Ìneira  et  al.  [74]  then  deployed
their  approach  on  a  subset  of  experimental  measurements  conducted
on  steam-  and  air-assisted flares  operated  under  20  distinct  scenarios
(7 for steam-assisted flares, 13 for air-assisted flares) during the 2010
TCEQ study [48]. In this case, the feature variables included the flame
area,  angle,  brightness,  and  hue.  The  PLS  regression  was  conducted
using  time-resolved images  collected at  1 Hz  for  5 min  per  test. Two
training schemes were used: in Scheme A, half of the entire image data
for one scenario was used to train the model and the other half was used
to assess the model, while in Scheme B, the model for each scenario was
trained using data from the other scenarios (steam-assist or air-assist)
while excluding the current scenario (cross-validation).

Fig. 17 compares CE values found by applying Scheme B to visible
images of an air-assisted flare to those found through extractive sam-
pling  (Sec.  3.1.1).  Scheme  B  is  more  representative  of  real-world
application, since the operating point and environmental conditions of
a  flare  are  unlikely  to  perfectly  match  those  used  to  construct  the
training dataset. Casti Ìneira et al. [74] showed Scheme A has a better
predictive capability than Scheme B, highlighting that the effectiveness

Fig. 18. Schematic of a DIAL measurement of a flare plume. In an ideal mea-
surement  scenario,  the  transceiver  unit  is  located  with  an  unobstructed  view
upstream and downstream of the plume. A concentration map is generated by
traversing  the  transceiver  through  an  arc  and  solving  the  LiDAR  equation  at
each angle. The concentration profile is then combined with a logarithmic wind
profile to obtain the mass flow rate.

of  this  approach  hinges  on  the  availability  of  a  training  dataset  that
includes flares operating under similar conditions. Particularly notable
is the poor predictive performance of the MIA algorithm for the last case
shown in Fig. 17, which was severely over-assisted; the flare operating
parameters  for  this  case  were  highly  distinct  from  the  others,  so  the
training model was inadequate. This outcome highlights the challenge of
data-driven measurement models.

3.2.5. Differential absorption LiDAR (DIAL)

Differential absorption LiDAR (DIAL) has been used in several flare
emission measurement campaigns [117â120]. A DIAL system consists of
a transceiver unit that contains multiple laser light sources, launch and
collection  optics,  and  data  logging  equipment.  Two  laser  pulses  of
several nanoseconds in duration are emitted simultaneously along a LOS
that transects the plume. The wavelength of one pulse is aligned with an
absorption line of the species of interest (âon-resonantâ), while the other
is a nearby wavelength transparent to the species of interest (âoff reso-
nantâ).  The  intensity  of  the  light  backscattered  by  aerosol  particles
(infrared wavelengths) or nitrogen molecules (ultraviolet wavelengths)
is  captured  using  a  telescope.  The  delay  between  pulse  emission  and
backscatter detection is related to the backscatter location along the LOS
by  the  speed  of  light,  while  the  ratio  of  on-  and  off-resonant  back-
scattered signals indicates the column density of target gas between the
backscattering event and the detector. These data are then deconvolved
in space/time to obtain the target gas distribution along the LOS; the
spatial resolution depends in part on the minimum pulse length, but also
on  the  signal-to-noise  ratio.  By  traversing  the  laser  through  an  arc,  a
plume cross-section may be generated as shown in Fig. 18. Finally, local
species concentrations are combined with anemometry data to obtain
the emissions flux.

This technique can measure many species with high precision and
selectivity. Typically, NOx, SO2, O3, benzene, and toluene are measured
using UV laser pulses, while the IR pulses are used for HCs [117,119].
Few et al. describe 14 measurement campaigns conducted by the UKâs
National Physics Laboratory (NPL) between 1983 and 2015 [117]. The
NPL  mobile  DIAL  system  is  mounted  in  a  truck  typically  positioned
~200  m  away  from  the  plume.  It  uses  a  combination  of  Neodymium
Yttrium-Aluminum Garnet (Nd:YAG) and dye lasers to generate tunable
infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths. Backscattered light is collected by
a telescope and directed to either a cooled InSb sensor (IR) or a photo-
multiplier tube (UV) and digitized using a high-speed oscilloscope that
gives a theoretical resolution of ~4 m, although in practice it is ~20â30
m due to noise. Signals are averaged over 250 shots to reduce variance.
Typically, each plume transect consists of between 7 and 20 lines, with
10 being a typical value, and requires 10â15 min to complete [120]. This
time window is much longer than the time scales relevant to the inter-
mittent/rogue events that may dominate flare CE as discussed in Sec.
2.2.3, so the field should be considered as time averaged.

A further advantage of DIAL is that, since it acquires range-resolved
measurements,  it  can  sample  both  inside  and  outside  the  plume  in  a
single measurement, allowing it to capture background concentrations
simultaneously. The DIAL signal returns can be combined with doppler
techniques to perform simultaneous wind and concentration measure-
ments [121].

The instrument has been used to estimate CE for scenarios in which
the fuel flow rate is known. Uncertainties are usually reported based on
the standard deviation of repeated scans [117,120], with the assumption
that the main sources of error are random and unbiased. Innocenti et al.
[120]  present  a  more  detailed  uncertainty  analysis  on  concentration
maps and mass emission rates. Typical uncertainties in the mass emis-
sion rates and concentrations are on the order of 10 % for sufficiently
large mass flow rates [120].

While DIAL may be used to obtain reliable concentrations and mass
emission rates for species that otherwise have a trace presence in the
atmosphere,  measuring  CO2  is  difficult  due  to  its  large  atmospheric
abundance. Over the long pathlengths typical of a DIAL measurement,

the enhancement of CO2 concentration from a flare plume may represent
a very small fraction of the overall column density and becomes âlostâ in
the noise when the LiDAR equation is deconvolved.

Only recently have systems been developed that could potentially be
used  to  measure  CO2  emissions  from  flare  plumes.  Robinson  et  al.
extended  the  capabilities  of  the  NPL  DIAL  system  by  targeting  the
1572.46 nm CO2 absorption feature [118]; this line is sufficiently strong
to have good sensitivity but not so strong that the atmosphere between
the plume and the instrument becomes opaque. This wavelength also
avoids  interference  from  nearby  H2O  lines.  A  proof-of-concept  mea-
surement was made on exhaust plumes at a coal-fired power plant [118].
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) also devel-
oped  a DIAL  system  capable of measuring CO2  and H2O in industrial
plumes  [122].  Rather  than  targeting  a  single  âon-resonantâ  line,  the
NIST  system  covers  10  wavelengths  that  span  a  CO2/H2O  line  pair
centered  at  1571.9  nm;  the  absorptances  obtained  from  these  wave-
lengths are then used to fit a theoretical line shape for the individual CO2
and H2O column densities. This technique was demonstrated to measure
CO2 and H2O emission rates from a natural gas power plant [122].

Despite these innovations, at the time of this writing the enhanced
capabilities of the NPL system have not been leveraged to obtain a CE
estimate independent of the known vent gas flow rate and composition,
and the current NIST system for measuring CO2  and H2O cannot mea-
sure HCs. However, it is questionable whether the capacity to measure
CO2  is important for DIAL measurements of flares, since the cost, size,
and complexity of these systems limit their use to situations where the
vent gas flow rate is known. Moreover, the long scan time means that
temporal  variations  in  CO2  and  HC  concentrations  that  may  provide
insight  into  the  cause  of  low  CE  performance  is  out  of  reach  for  this
instrument. Nevertheless, this instrument is likely the most accurate and
reliable means to obtain a time-averaged concentration field within a
flare  plume  and  will  remain  a  critical  part  of  future  measurement
campaigns.

4. Summary and outlook

4.1. Current state-of-the-art

Quantifying  flare  emissions  is  assuming  new  importance  with
growing recognition of the environmental and health impacts of flaring
and emerging evidence suggesting that flares may not operate as effi-
ciently  as  originally  thought.  Accurate  flare  emission  estimates  are
needed  to  assess  these  impacts;  develop  and  enforce  science-based
regulation  and  policy;  and  design  cleaner  and  more  reliable  flaring
technology.  The  accuracy  of  flare  emission  measurements  must  be
quantified  and  improved  as  flare  emission  regulations  become  more
stringent.  Previously,  US  EPA  rules  were  written  such  that  if  certain
operating conditions were met (NHVcz, flare tip velocity, presence of a
pilot flame, etc.), the flare was assumed to operate with an overall CE of
98 % [60]. In new rules effective May 7, 2024, flares burning associated
gas from new wells must achieve DREs for CH4 and VOC emissions of 95
%, although it is not clear how these DREs will be determined [30]. Also
of note is the $35 million, three-year research program, Reducing Emis-
sions of Methane Every Day of the Year (REMEDY, 2023â2026), whose
stated goal is to seek âsystem-level technical solutions that achieve 99.5
% methane conversionâ (e.g., DRECH4) from three source types, one of
which is the approximately 300,000 flares associated with oil and gas
development [123]. Proposed solutions cannot be verified experimen-
tally unless the uncertainty in the DRECH4 measurements can be ascer-
tained.  Unfortunately,  the  REMEDY  program  does  not  include  any
in  CE/DRE
research
measurements.

focused  on  quantifying

the  uncertainty

Reliable CE/DRE estimates are challenging due to the inaccessibility
of flare plumes and the fact that key phenomena impacting overall flare
CE  are  intermittent  and  localized.  There  is  no  âone-size-fits-allâ  or
âGoldilocksâ solution for quantifying CE or DRE; instead, each technique

21

K.J. Daun and J.P. Spinti

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 110 (2025) 101235

has its own strengths and weaknesses as well as applications for which it
is well suited. Satellite observations are useful for estimating emissions
from thousands of flares over a wide area but cannot measure the per-
formance of a single flare. Aircraft can efficiently take measurements in
the large numbers of flare plumes needed to capture the broad distri-
bution of flare performance across a basin, albeit with less sensitivity
compared to near-field sampling. Near-field sampling defines the âgold
standardâ against which other techniques are evaluated but cannot be
generally  applied  on  working  flares.  Open-path  FTIR  instruments  are
particularly useful for fingerprinting and quantifying the complex spe-
cies  that  may  arise  in  downstream  flaring,  including  products  of
incomplete combustion, but they can only resolve a single LOS at once,
making them sensitive to plume heterogeneity. The IFTSs can map the
distribution  of  column  densities  within  the  flare  plume  and  provide
insight into the combustion and fluid dynamics that may lead to poor
flare performance but are too costly and complex for continuous, real-
time  monitoring.  On  the  other  hand,  the  simplifications  needed  to
facilitate low-cost, real-time analysis using imaging systems designed for
continuous monitoring may also impact the reliability of the estimates.
Systematic bias may also be present due to the fuel-stripping phe-
nomenon identified by Johnson et al. [52,53] for flares in crosswind.
Researchers who compare remote-sensing results to the âgold standardâ
of extractive sampling (e.g., Refs. [63,68]) may be entirely missing the
region downstream of the flare stack and below the level of the flare tip
where unburned hydrocarbons are most likely to be found. We are not
aware of any work that has been performed to quantify the effects of fuel
stripping by sampling in the fuel-stripping region in full-scale, operating
flares. This knowledge gap must be addressed with urgency.

4.2. Emerging technologies and methodologies for measuring flare
emissions

In our assessment, the current suite of techniques and instrumenta-
tion  available to  measure flare  emissions are  inadequate to  fulfill the
growing need for increasingly precise and accurate emissions estimates,
particularly  given  tightening  environmental  regulations  and  the
increasing urgency of the climate crisis. Fortunately, there are emerging,
disruptive  advancements  in  sensors,  unmanned  aerial  vehicles,  and
artificial intelligence (AI) that may help meet these requirements.

4.2.1. Extractive sampling approaches

As outlined in Secs. 2.2.2 and 2.2.3, the main factors that limit the
accuracy  of  extractive  sampling  estimates  are  the  intermittency  and
spatial  heterogeneity  of  the  flare  plume.  A  further  limitation  is  the

inaccessibility  of  the  flare  plume;  to  date,  near-field  extractive  mea-
surement campaigns have almost all been limited to special âfield testsâ
involving flares installed in such a way as to facilitate these measure-
ments,  which  would  otherwise  be  difficult  to  obtain  from  operating
flares  in  upstream,  midstream,  or  downstream  environments.  In  this
regard, uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer a significant opportunity
to  characterize  emissions  from  working  flares.  TDLAS  sensors  are
particularly  well  suited  to  characterizing  the  species  within  a  flare
plume, including CO2, CO, CH4, and other HCs. These sensors are small
and light enough to be incorporated into a drone payload, although each
species typically requires a dedicated TDLAS sensor. TDLAS sensors may
provide a point concentration measurement or, in some cases, the in-
tensity  measurement  of  a  vertically  oriented,  ground-reflected  signal,
providing  vertical  column  density  [124].  Martinez  et  al.  describe  a
UAV-mountable CRDS sensor capable of measuring CH4 concentrations
at an even higher resolution than can be achieved with a TDLAS sensor
[125].

When estimating flare CE/DRE, it is necessary to measure multiple
species  simultaneously,  e.g.,  CO,  CO2  and  the  HC  species  of  interest.
Smith et al.  describe a  UAV with lightweight, carbon-nanotube-based
sensors for measuring CO, CO2, and CH4, which has been deployed on
industrial  flares  at  Zeecoâs  test  facility  [126].  Festa-Blanchet  et  al.
developed  a  UAV  containing  lightweight,  commercial  sensors  for
measuring CH4, C2H6, CO2, and CO concentrations, which can be con-
verted  into  a  local  CE  estimate  using  Eq.  (5) [127].  Given  the  inter-
mittency  and  heterogeneity  of  flare  plumes,  however,  converting
concentrations measured along the UAV flight path to an overall flare
CE/DRE estimate with uncertainty would require careful consideration
and detailed analysis.

4.2.2.

Imaging systems

An ideal infrared hyperspectral imaging system would provide high
degrees  of  spatial,  spectral,  and  temporal  resolution  to  quantify  the
transient species mass fluxes needed to derive the flare CE/DRE. How-
ever, current imaging systems provide either high degrees of spatial and
spectral  resolution  with  lower  temporal  resolution  (IFTS)  or  high  de-
grees of temporal and spatial resolution with lower spectral resolution
(line-scan or light-field cameras). To a certain extent these limitations
are inherent to the operating principles of these systems: the spectral
resolution achievable through a light-field camera is limited by the pitch
of the microlens and FPAs, while the temporal resolution of an IFTS is
limited by the quantum efficiency of the FPA (integration time) and the
speed  of  the  moving  optical  components.  Recent  disruptive  improve-
ments  in  optoelectronic  miniaturization  and  the  development  of  high

quantum-efficiency  MWIR  and  LWIR  sensors,  driven  in  large  part  by
defence-related applications, will lead to systems that provide a better
compromise among temporal, spatial, and spectral resolution.

The  performance  of  image-based  systems  is  also  limited  by  the
computational effort required to process the immense amount of data
generated by the IFTS (on the order of gigabytes per cube). At the time of
writing, the computational effort required to infer the concentration and
temperature  distribution  along  a  single  pixel  LOS  is  on  the  order  of
several minutes, which limits the number of pixels that can be analyzed
in  a  single  image.  In  this  regard,  advancements  in  high-performance
computing  and  machine  learning  (ML)  offer  opportunities  for  highly
accurate instrument models that can provide near real-time analysis.

4.2.3. Active methane-only remote sensing

In scenarios where the vent gas flow rate is inferred through a carbon
mass balance on the flare plume, the requirement to measure all carbon-
containing  species  in  the  flare  plume  is  a  significant  measurement
challenge for remote sensing since these species absorb and emit radi-
ation at different wavelengths. However, if the objective is to quantify
only CH4 concentrations in the plume, other techniques based on active
near-infrared (NIR) sensing near the 1.65 Î¼m band may prove useful, e.
g., using an aircraft-mounted, tunable diode laser [128] as a source, and
then  inferring  the  CH4  column  density  through  the  plume  from  the
ground-reflected return signal. However, it would be unlikely that the
infrequent ârogueâ events that are responsible for emissions of unburned
fuel  (Sec.  2.2.3)  would  be  adequately  captured  during  a  single
overflight.

Under  these  conditions,  fixed,  ground-based  imaging  systems  that
target fugitive CH4  may also be used to identify unlit and poorly per-
forming flares. Fig. 19 shows unburned CH4 detected in the shadow of a
flare plume using a Kuva GC1360 OGI, which detects methane plumes
based on the absorption of ground-reflected sunlight over the 1.65 Î¼m
band  imaged  using  a  fixed,  downward-looking,  multiband  short-
wavelength infrared sensor [129].

4.2.4. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)

There is a growing trend towards using AI and ML, a subset of AI, to
determine CE and DRE in open-flame flares. For example, expert systems
developed from âtraining dataâ may exploit subtle and sometimes hid-
den relationships among readily observable quantities like the visible
flame  shape  and  flare  operating  parameters  to  infer  CE  and  DRE.
Recently,  a  team  at  Baker  Hughes  and  BP  [38,73]  employed  AI  to
generalize the input variables that affect CE and DRE, including vent gas
NHV,  exit  velocity,  composition  and  molecular  weight  as  well  as
crosswind speed and, for assisted flares, the assist-gas flow rate. They
obtained  CE  and  DRE  data  from  extractive-sampling  measurements,
augmented with CFD-LES simulations of high-wind conditions that were
difficult  to  achieve  during  testing.  The  researchers  included  un-
certainties  developed  from  two  different  methods:  standard  error
propagation  [130]  and  Monte  Carlo  analysis  [131].  Lou  et  al.  [132]
collected output (CE and opacity) and input (operating condition) data
from seven different sources for a total of 280 data points. Using these
data, they developed a zone-based (for managing outliers) ML algorithm
for predicting CE and opacity in flares, noting that CE exhibited a strong
dependence  on  vent  gas  composition.  These  same  data  sources  were
used by Damodara et al. [14] to develop ML models for predicting CE
based on neural networks. Pandiyan et al. [133] expanded the types of
empirically  based  ML  models  that  can  be  applied  to  existing  experi-
mental CE and DRE data using 425 data points collected from seven flare
datasets. And, as discussed in Sec. 3.2.5, Casti Ìneira et al. [74] used an
expert system to connect visible flame images generated from CFD-LES
data to wind-tunnel measurements of flare CE. The reliability of this type
of approach hinges on the accuracy and relevance of the training data.
Given the difficulties of using extractive sampling to measure CE (Sec
3.1.1) and the limited fidelity of CFD-LES models, the validity of expert
systems trained using these data remains questionable.

There is also a trend towards using data from experiments and sim-
ulations within the context of ML to refine the system models (calibra-
tion).  The  calibrated  model  then  becomes  the  tool  for  system
optimization (AI) by predicting system performance (with uncertainty)
in regimes for which experimental data do not exist. As an example, Elias
et  al.  [70]  described  a  Bayesian  ML  methodology  applied  to  a  set  of
steam-assisted  flare  experiments  [62].  The  authors  used  CFD-LES
simulation  data  and  experimental  CE  data  measured  with  a  PFTIR  to
determine  the  distributions  of  uncertain  model  parameters,  including
wind  speed  and  direction and  assist-gas flow  rate.  Using these  model
parameter distributions, they predicted the distribution of CE for a given
set of flare operating conditions. Thus, the methodology produces dis-
tributions of the QOI (flare CE) conditioned on the observed data (the
current state of knowledge) for any unobserved set of operational pa-
rameters using the calibrated, physics-based model as the scaling tool.
This methodology is discussed in more detail in the next section.

4.3. Estimating CE/DRE with quantified uncertainty

Missing  from  most  discussions  about  current  and  emerging  tech-
nologies  for  measuring CE/DRE  is  a robust,  generalizable  method  for
quantifying the uncertainty of the measurement. Without knowing un-
certainty, we cannot answer even basic questions: How much do flares
contribute to overall greenhouse gas emissions in a given jurisdiction?
Will  the  accuracy  of  this  CE/DRE  estimate  improve  with  more  mea-
surements?  How  significant  is  the  expected  improvement  realized
through a change in flare tip design or operational practice, and is it
worth the cost? These and similar questions can only be answered by
knowing the uncertainty attached to the relevant CE/DRE measurement,
particularly as flares are required to operate at ever higher CE and DRE
values.

Much  of  the  uncertainty  attached  to  these  estimates  arises  from
simplifying assumptions made to the instrument models, the validity of
which depends on the circumstance. For example, the measured data are
collected over some time interval, which may range from fractions of
seconds to 15 min or longer; shorter sampling  times require  a longer
sampling duration to capture the time-averaged plume behaviour, while
longer sampling times may miss key correlations between variables that
occur over short time scales. Also, many of these models approximate
the plume as homogeneous in composition; these conditions might be
satisfied  far  downstream  of  the  combustion  zone  but  may  be  a  poor
approximation  near  the  flame,  particularly  in  cases  of  steam  and  air
over-assistance.  Far-field  sampling  techniques  assume  that  the  flare
plume components originate from the flare in question, which may not
be the case. Remote-sensing techniques based on emission spectroscopy
may not detect stripped fuel that is too cold to be measured reliably [72].
All these assumptions contribute to measurement uncertainty and need
to  be  accounted  for  when  reporting  âmeasuredâ  CE  or  DRE  values,  a
challenging  task  due  to  the  complexity  of  the  underlying  phenomena
and to the limited information that may be gleaned from the flare plume.
In the case of remote-sensing techniques, uncertainty estimates are
often derived by comparing inferred CE/DRE estimates with those found
through  extractive  sampling,  which  are  subject  to  their  own  un-
certainties  that  are  poorly  understood.  Overall,  we  view  the  lack  of
uncertainty  quantification  as  one  of  the  key  factors  that  needs  to  be
addressed by future research.

4.3.1. Bayesian uncertainty quantification

In speaking of how modern (e.g., frequentist) statistics are used in
science, Clayton writes, âAt the heart of the problem is a fundamental
misunderstanding of  the quantification of uncertainty - that is  proba-
bility - and its role in drawing inferences from dataâ [134]. He goes on to
differentiate  between  sampling  probabilities  (frequency-based  inter-
pretation) and inferential probabilities (degree-of-confidence interpre-
tation). âSampling probabilities go from hypothesis to data: Given an
assumption,  what  will  we  observe,  and  how  often?  Inferential

23

K.J. Daun and J.P. Spinti

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 110 (2025) 101235

probabilities go from data to hypothesis: Given what we observed, what
can we conclude and with what certainty?â Clayton then points to the
application of Bayesâ  Law and its inferential probability as the way to
correct the misunderstanding [134].

In  the  Bayesian  viewpoint,  the  measurements,  model  parameters,
and even the models themselves are viewed, not as deterministic values,
but rather as random variables that have a probability density. Conse-
quently, we must learn to think in terms of distributions instead of single
values (âpoint estimatesâ). For example, there is no single CE/DRE for a
flare; rather, one may state that the CE or DRE belongs to a given interval
(e.g.,  99â100  %)  with  a  certain  probability  (e.g.,  90  %).  Within  the
context  of  Bayesian  uncertainty  quantification,  probability  represents
our  state  of  knowledge,  and  that  state  of  knowledge  is  continually
improving as new information (experimental measurements, simulation
data) becomes available.

We  propose  the  following  generalized  Bayesian  approach  for
addressing the challenge of obtaining estimates of flare emissions with
quantified uncertainty.

Provide more rigorous definitions of CE/DRE so that measurements made
with different instruments can be evaluated on the same basis. These defi-
nitions should account for the impacts of intermittency, heterogeneity,
and rogue events that skew the distribution of outcomes. The definitions
should also consider sample size and location. For example, should CE
be  computed  based  on  time-averaged  values  in  the  flare  plume  or
defined  as  the  median  of  a  distribution  of  short-time-scale  samples?
Seymour  and  Johnson  [59]  showed  that  ~100  measurements  were
required for the median value of BC/H2O ratios measured in field flares
to  be  within  10  %  of  the  true  mean.  These  definitions  can  then  be
incorporated into the instrument models used to compute CE/DRE.

Use data from both experiments and âdigital twinâ CFD-LES simulations.
The two sources of information available to estimate flare CE/DRE are
experimental  data (usually  radiometric  observations), ye,  and  simula-
tion  data,  ym.  However,  experimental  data  obtained  from  any  of  the
instruments (and their associated models) described in this paper as well
as simulation data from a high-fidelity, physics-based flare model are
only approximations; each source has unquantified bias due to limita-
tions  of  the  chosen  model  form  [135].  Fortunately,  we  can  elucidate
these  errors  from  the  difference  between  simulation  data  and  experi-
mental  observations,  ym(cid:0) ye,  also  known  as  the  defect,  within  the
framework  of  Bayesian  calibration.  In  other  words,  by  using  experi-
mental  (i.e.,  instrument  model)  and  simulation  data  together,  we
determine the uncertainty resulting from anything not captured by the
models (latent effects); this includes âmissing physicsâ introduced by the

simplifications  made  when  deriving  both  simulation  and  instrument
models. The advantage of this Bayesian methodology is that we do not
have to define the PDF of the latent effects (represented by the variance,
Ï2, or standard deviation, Ï, of the distribution) a priori; rather, we infer
it by performing the Bayesian analysis. Through this technique, we can
compute flare CE/DRE with quantified uncertainty.

Calibrate uncertain parameters from the data using a Bayesian approach.
Use impact analysis to identify the set of uncertain parameters (opera-
tional,  instrument  model,  simulation  model)  that  have  the  largest
impact on the QOI (CE/DRE) due to uncertainty about the parameterâs
value  or  the  QOIâs  sensitivity  to  the  parameter.  This  set  includes  the
âlatent  effectsâ  parameter,  ÏCE,  that  accounts  for  all  uncertainty  not
explicitly determined by the remaining uncertain parameters. Bayesian
calibration generates the posterior PDF, a multidimensional PDF of the
uncertain parameter set informed by the experimental data, the simu-
lation  data,  and  any  available  prior  information  [136].  The  posterior
PDF amounts to a comprehensive definition of the uncertainty attached
to the identified uncertain parameter set for a given set of defects and
prior knowledge.

Compute variables with quantified uncertainty that may (i.e., CEPFTIR) or
may not (i.e., overall or âtrueâ  CE/DRE) be measured using the posterior
PDF and the simulation data. From the simulations, extract QOI data (e.g.,
CEPFTIR,  overall CE/DRE) and create surrogate models from these data
that are functions of the uncertain parameter set. Next, generate random
iterates of the uncertain model parameters that are sampled from the
posterior PDF. Lastly, input the sampled parameters into the surrogate
models of the QOIs to obtain PDFs of the QOIs at the current operating
conditions [136]. These posterior predictive distributions quantitatively
define what is known about the CE/DRE given all available information.
As an example, we performed a Bayesian analysis using experimental
data (ye) from PFTIR measurements on a steam-assisted, industrial-scale
flare at the John Zink flare test facility [62] and simulation data (ym)
from a suite of seven simulations of the flare using the CFD-LES code
Uintah/Arches [70]. The uncertain parameter set included: (1) instru-
ment model parameters related to the aiming location for the PFTIR, (2)
scenario parameters related to the operation of the flare (steam flow rate
and wind speed/direction), and (3) ÏCE  (to account for all uncertainty
not captured by the other parameters).

Fig. 20 shows the posterior predictive PDF for a PFTIR-inferred CE of
this steam-assisted flare [62]. This figure corresponds to a specific test
condition (fuel flow rate, steam flow rate, wind speed, and wind direc-
tion)  where  two  replicate  measurements  were  available  within  the
reproducibility  achievable  in  an  industrial-scale  flare  test  (test  condi-
tions varied by < 5 %). The vertical dotted lines represent the experi-
mentally measured PFTIR values for the two replicates. These replicates
indicate  that  the  experimental-measurement  (e.g.,  instrument-model)
error alone precludes measuring the âtrueâ CE within 1 %.

From the Bayesian analysis, we can quantify the contribution of each
parameterâs uncertainty to the overall uncertainty of the CEPFTIR  mea-
surement.  The  blue  PDF  in  Fig.  20 represents  the  contribution  of  the
instrument  model  parameter  uncertainty  (measurement  aiming  loca-
tion) to the total CEPFTIR  uncertainty. The yellow PDF adds the contri-
bution of the scenario-parameter uncertainty (frequently assumed to be
zero, e.g., the wind speed is exactly what is measured). The orange PDF
adds the contribution of ÏCE. In this case, the latent effects dominate the
uncertainty and illustrate that the "measuredâ CEPFTIR value has a large
uncertainty that precludes it from being used in situations requiring high
levels  of  measurement  accuracy.  In  other  words,  there  are  sources  of
uncertainty  in  this  system  outside  of  the  parameters  in  the  uncertain
parameter set that produce a CE distribution ranging from 0.3 to 1.0 for
one specific test condition. Given this uncertainty, there is no way to
prove that a design modification âimprovesâ CE by 1 % (say from 98 %
to 99 %). Bayesian analysis does not identify the source of the latent
effects. It is up to the operators, analysts, experimentalists, and simu-
lation  scientists  familiar  with  the  system  to  identify  other  potential
source(s)  of  uncertainty  (either  in  the  data-collection  process/

collection and/or model form(s), and repeat the Bayesian analysis.

4.3.2. Flare data for uncertainty quantification

The uncertainty quantification methodology outlined in the previous
section requires high-quality experimental data, preferably with well-
defined instrument models. Recently, Raman and Hassanaly [137,138]
defined three classes of problems based on data availability: 1) Data-rich
problems,  where
large  and  continuous  data  streams  require
fast-execution  processing  tools  (e.g., ML tools)  focused on identifying
features in the data, 2) data-sufficient problems, where validation tests
of  high-fidelity  computational  models  using  data  obtained  from
well-developed  experimental  capabilities  builds  trust  in  the  models,
which can then be used to evaluate the effect of design variations on the
QOIs, and 3) data-poor problems, where neither experimental data nor
computational models can provide the data needed to define measure-
ment  uncertainty,  explore  design  modifications,  or  obtain  useful  in-
sights. Subsets of data-poor problems include the exploration of events
with  a  low  probability  of  occurring  and  of  extreme  operational  envi-
ronments where the associated physics are not well understood.

Data-poor  problems  have  received  much  less  attention  than  their
data-rich  and  data-sufficient  counterparts.  Historical  and  recent
industrial-scale flaring studies in the public domain have provided the
beginnings of a database for evaluating flare performance and the ac-
curacy of measurement techniques used to obtain the QOIs [25,26,48,
54,54,62,105,139â144]. We acknowledge the value of these data and
the considerable efforts that were made to obtain them. Nevertheless,
uncertainty quantification of CE/DRE measurements in industrial-scale
flares  is  a  data-poor  problem  for  the  reasons  described  in  this  paper.
Moving  from  a  data-poor  to  a  data-sufficient  regime  will  require
consistent definitions of CE/DRE (e.g., how to account for spatial and
temporal  variations  in  computing  global  CE  from  local  CE  measure-
ments),  better  understanding  and  analysis  of  the  instrument  models
being used to measure CE/DRE, standardized tools for determining the
uncertainty  of  various  measurement  methodologies,  and  the  employ-
ment  of  data  obtained  from  physics-based  simulations  run  on
high-performance  computing  resources  to  augment  the  sparse  experi-
mental data.

Clearly,  uncertainty  quantification  for  CE/DRE  measurements  will
require  more  resources  for  experimental  measurements  and  for  high-
fidelity simulations. But, without knowing what we do not know, the
CE/DRE  values  we  measure  are  meaningless.  Questions  to  consider
include:  (1)  How  should  operational  parameters  be  determined  for
measurement data sets obtained without the operatorâs knowledge? (2)
How should intermittency and heterogeneity be incorporated? (3) How
might  expensive  CFD-LES  simulations  be  leveraged  (such  as  using  a
design  of  experiments  and  surrogate  models  to  represent  simulation
data)? (4) How may we create instrument models for proprietary tech-
nology?  These  questions  can  be  answered  in  greater  or  lesser  detail
depending  on  resources  available;  engineering  approximations  (prior
knowledge  in  Bayesian  terms)  will  fill  in  the  gaps.  Because  of  the
expense  involved,  we  envision  the  development  of  digital  twins  that
incorporate  these  Bayesian  analysis  tools  and  can  be  applied  across
broad classes of flares with the underlying physics-based models being
used to interpolate physics and extrapolate scale. Uncertainty quantifi-
cation  is  the  missing  link  in  developing  new  methodologies  for  flare
emissions measurements.

Dr. Kyle J. Daun is a Professor in the Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics En-
gineering at the University of Waterloo. He received his PhD from the University of Texas
at Austin in 2003, focusing on inverse design of radiant enclosures. From 2004 to 2007, Dr.
Daun worked at the National Research Council Canada as a Natural Sciences and Engi-
neering Research Council of Canada postdoctoral fellow and later as a research officer,
before joining the University of Waterloo in 2007. Dr. Daunâs research interests include
inverse  problems  in radiative  transfer, optical  combustion  diagnostics,  and  uncertainty
quantification.  His  most  recent  work  focuses  on  developing  optical  diagnostics  and
Bayesian  techniques  for  quantifying  methane  emissions  from  flares  and  other  sources,
along  with  associated  uncertainty  estimates.  Dr.  Daun  is  a  Fellow  of  the  Humboldt
Foundation and the American Society of Mechanical Engineering. In 2010, he received the
JQSRT Ray Viskanta Young Scientist Award.

Dr. Jennifer P. Spinti is a Research Associate Professor in the Department of Chemical
Engineering at the University of Utah. She has spent her career studying all aspects of
combustion  through both  experimental and computational  work.  Dr. Spinti  earned  her
Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from the University of Utah in 1997. Her doctoral work
focused on the fate of nitrogen that remains in the char during pulverized coal combustion.
Since then, Dr. Spinti has had research roles in three large programs at the University of
Utah: Center for Simulation of Accidental Fires and Explosions, Clean and Secure Energy
from  Domestic  Oil  Shale  and  Oil  Sands  Resources  Program,  and  the  National  Nuclear
Security  Administrationâs  Predictive  Science  Academic  Alliance  Program  (PSAAP).  The
PSAAP program focused on uncertainty quantification in electric power generation; the
methods developed as part of that program are transferrable to other difficult-to-measure
combustion  environments  such  as  gas  flares.  Dr.  Spinti  has  performed  simulations  of
buoyancy-driven flows, including pool fires and flares. Recently, she has focused on using
Bayesâ Law to quantify the uncertainty of measurements made in combustion systems.
