Understanding of the chemical processes that govern formation and destruction of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in
combustion processes continues to be a challenge. Even though this area has been the subject of extensive
research over the last four decades, there are still unresolved issues that may limit the accuracy of engineer-
ing calculations and thereby the potential of primary measures for NOx control. In this review our current
understanding of the mechanisms that are responsible for combustion-generated nitrogen-containing air
pollutants is discussed. The thermochemistry of the relevant nitrogen compounds is updated, using
the Active Thermochemical Tables (ATcT) approach. Rate parameters for the key gas-phase reactions of the
nitrogen species are surveyed, based on available information from experiments and high-level theory. The
mechanisms for thermal and prompt-NO, for fuel-NO, and NO formation via NNH or N2O are discussed,
along with the chemistry of NO removal processes such as reburning and Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction
of NO. Each subset of the mechanism is evaluated against experimental data and the accuracy of modeling
predictions is discussed.

1. Introduction

PEmission of oxides of nitrogen from combustion and high tem-
perature industrial processes continues to be an environmental con-
cern. Nitrogen oxides, collectively termed NOx, are formed in
essentially all combustion processes, mostly as nitric oxide (NO)
with smaller amounts of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and nitrous oxide
(N2O). Nitric oxide is subsequently oxidized to NO2 in the atmo-
sphere. Nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide are acid rain precursors
and participate in the generation of photochemical smog, while
nitrous oxide is a greenhouse gas.

PSeveral separate mechanisms have been identified that can lead
to formation of nitrogen oxides in significant quantities. These
mechanisms involve either fixation of the molecular nitrogen con-
tained in the combustion air or oxidation of organic nitrogen chemi-
cally bound in the fuel. Fig. 1 provides an overview of the most
important sources of NO in combustion.

PFor gaseous fuels with no or negligible amounts of fuel-bound
nitrogen (e.g., natural gas), as well as for fuels with a low nitrogen
content (oil, woody biomass, plastic waste), formation of NO arises
from fixation of N2 in the combustion air. Homogeneous mecha-
nisms for fixation of N2 involve the attack of reactive radicals (O,
CHn, H) on the triple bond in molecular nitrogen [1(cid:1)4]. These

Fig. 1. Simplified reaction path diagram illustrating the major steps in the formation
of thermal NO, prompt NO, and fuel NO. Recycling of NO to N2 through reaction with
atomic nitrogen or to cyanides through reaction with hydrocarbon radicals is not
shown.

Preactions form either NO or a reactive nitrogen intermediate (N2O,
cyanides, NNH) that may subsequently be oxidized to NO. For fuels
with a considerable content of organically bound nitrogen, i.e., most
solid fuels, oxidation of fuel-bound nitrogen constitutes the domi-
nant source of nitrogen oxides. Here, formation of NO will depend
on the partitioning of fuel-N between volatiles and char. The chemis-
try of the volatile nitrogen is complicated, since it may involve oxi-
dation of tar-N, soot-N, cyclic compounds, and light species such as
HCN and NH3. Volatile-N from coal is mostly released with tar,
emerging subsequently mainly as HCN, while for biomass and low
rank coals, significant amounts of NH3 may be released directly from
the solid matrix during devolatilization [3].

PA large amount of work has been devoted to improve the under-
standing of NOx formation mechanisms in combustion and to
develop control strategies to reduce emissions [1(cid:1)3,5,6]. Restric-
tions on NOx emissions that used to apply only to large combustion
systems such as power plants are now implemented on ever
smaller scales: they continue to be a driving force for research and
development in many industrial high temperature processes. In
large power plants and for certain engines, emissions are typically
controlled by catalytic flue gas cleaning. However, this technology
can be challenging to use for fuels such as biomass and waste due
to poisoning issues or undesirable due to comparatively high costs.
For this reason there is still an incentive to control NOx emissions
by primary means or by in-situ techniques such as Selective Non-
Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) or reburning. To achieve this aim, it is
important to have access to reliable and versatile chemical kinetic
models for formation and consumption of NO in high temperature
processes. The use of detailed reaction mechanisms together with
engineering models such as Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
has, with the strongly enhanced computational power now avail-
able, become an important tool in designing low-NOx combustion
systems.

PThe objective of the present work is to establish and evaluate a
state-of-the-art, non-optimized chemical kinetic model for homoge-
neous nitrogen chemistry in combustion. It is based on the work on
nitrogen chemistry reported over the last decades, drawing also on
recent advances in the knowledge of thermochemistry and reaction
rates from theoretical work. The different mechanisms for formation
and consumption of NO are discussed and the key reaction steps are
evaluated. Different subsets of the model are validated against
experimental data and the predictive capability of the mechanism is
assessed.

PTo limit the scope of the review, we emphasize nitrogen chemis-
try in combustion of light hydrocarbons, mostly CH4, and/or light
fuel-nitrogen species (HCN, NH3, HNCO) at atmospheric or sub-
atmospheric pressure. Oxidation of heterocyclic nitrogen com-
pounds, which may be formed in combustion of more complex fuels,
or of energetic materials such as nitroalkanes is not addressed in the
current work. Furthermore, we focus on experimental conditions

Pthat are sufficiently well-defined for kinetic interpretation and
refrain from modeling practical combustion systems, partly due to
the fact that turbulent flow characteristics and turbulence/chemistry
interactions may play a significant role, and partly due to the need
for simplified chemistry when used in computational fluid dynamics
calculations.

PIn this review, a wide range of experimental data has been
selected for model validation, including results from laminar pre-
mixed flames at low and atmospheric pressure, from shock tube
experiments, and from jet-stirred reactors. Modeling predictions
have also been compared extensively to data obtained in laminar
flow reactors. However, data from flow reactors are prone to
uncertainties in initial conditions, either due to conditioning
(mixing, preheating) or interference from reactions on the reactor
surface, even for fairly inert materials such as quartz and alumina.
For this reason, care must be taken when interpreting the results
[7]. In Appendix A, it is discussed how quartz surfaces may inter-
act with the gas phase chemistry in flow and batch reactors. In
reality, all experimental approaches suffer from complications
that must be kept in mind when used for model development and
evaluation.

2. Detailed chemical kinetic model

PA chemical kinetic model consists of a reaction mechanism along
with thermodynamic properties and transport coefficients for the
involved species. A reaction mechanism for nitrogen chemistry in
combustion will have to include submechanisms for hydrocarbon
oxidation, oxidation of reactive nitrogen species (amines, cyanides,
etc.), and interactions between the hydrocarbon and nitrogen chem-
istry (e.g., prompt NO, reburning). The model established in this
review is based on work on nitrogen chemistry published over
the last 40 years. However, the thermochemistry and the rate
constants for reactions important for formation and consumption
of NO are re-evaluated based on recent high-level theory work.
The full model in Chemkin input format is available as Supple-
mentary Material. Specific aspects of the model are discussed in
detail in the following.

2.1. Thermodynamic properties

PTable 1 lists thermodynamic properties for selected species in the
model. The data for these species were reevaluated in the present
work using the Active Thermochemical Tables (ATcT) approach [8,9].
Particular emphasis was on the thermochemistry of selected hydro-
carbon radicals and reactive nitrogen species. Where relevant, these
are discussed in more detail in the sections below. Heats of forma-
tion for the CHn hydrocarbon radicals are entirely consistent with
the recent evaluation of Ruscic [10], which was based on ver. 1.122
of the ATcT Thermochemical Network (TN) [11]. The listed values
are based on the updated progeny ATcT TN ver. 1.122b, which was
augmented with new determinations during a subsequent effort to
extract the best currently available energy difference between HCN
and HNC, as well as the enthalpies of formation of these two species
and their positive and negative ions [12]. ATcT TN ver. 1.122b was
also used to develop and benchmark new high-level composite elec-
tronic structure methods known as ANLn [13]. In order to obtain the
requisite NASA thermodynamic polynomials for the species listed in
Table 1, JANAF-style tabular ATcT outputs based on the results from
TN ver. 1.122b (containing temperatures, isobaric heat capacities,
entropies, enthalpy increments, and enthalpies of formation, using
50 K increments) were fitted using the gold-standard NASA PAC pro-
gram of McBride and Gordon [14].

PThe thermodynamic properties for other species were mostly
adopted from the Ideal Gas Thermochemical Database by Goos, Bur-
cat and Ruscic [15] (which is periodically updated with available
ATcT enthalpies of formation).

2.2. Reaction mechanism

PThe core of the reaction mechanism is based on recent work by
the authors on the chemistry of C1(cid:1)C2 hydrocarbons [16(cid:1)18],
amines [19], cyanides [20], and hydrocarbon/nitrogen interactions
[21(cid:1)23]. However, many features of the model date back to work in
the1980's [1,24]. The nitrogen chemistry subsets of the mechanism
will be discussed in the following sections. In this section we discuss
briefly the reactions in the fuel oxidation subset that are of particular
importance for the nitrogen chemistry.

Pbeen measured directly in shock tube studies [27,28] and inferred
from a number of flame studies [29(cid:1)36]. In addition, the reverse
reaction,
N þ NO @ O þ N2

ðR1Þ

has been characterized experimentally over a wide range of temper-
ature [26,37(cid:1)46]. The N + NO reaction is expected to have little if
any pressure dependence because the minimum energy path on the
ground electronic surface is purely attractive with no minimum
[47].

PFig. 2 shows an Arrhenius plot for reaction R1. Data for the O + N2
reaction (R1b) are converted through the equilibrium constant.
Baulch et al. [26] estimated the uncertainty in the rate constant to be
a factor of two, providing a recommendation for k1b that is 50(cid:1)70%
larger than their value for k1 divided by the equilibrium constant.

PWe have adopted the rate constant for reaction R1 from the
recent study of Abian et al. [46]. They determined k1 from flow reac-
tor experiments, measuring NO formation from N2/O2 mixtures at
1700(cid:1)1800 K, and extrapolated the rate constant to a wider temper-
ature range taking literature data into account. Their resulting value
is 25% above the recommendation of Baulch et al. for k1, while it cor-
responds to a value k1b 25% below the Baulch et al. evaluation, rec-
onciling the data for the forward and reverse rate constant (Fig. 2).

P3.1.2. Modeling thermal NO formation

PComparatively little experimental work, reviewed in [46,50,51],
has been conducted to characterize thermal NO formation under
well-controlled conditions. Following Abian et al. [46], we have
selected the flow reactor data of Arai et al. [52] and the flame
data from Homer and Sutton [53] for comparison with modeling
predictions.

PArai et al. [52] conducted an experimental study of the O2/N2
system in an isothermal laminar flow reactor, investigating the
effect of the O2 mole fraction (0.05(cid:1)0.95) and the temperature
(1550(cid:1)1750 K) on the formation of NO. Fig. 3 compares the

PFormation and consumption of nitric oxide in combustion are
strongly dependent on the radical pool. Formation of NO through the
thermal NO mechanism, or through N2O or NNH, is dependent on
the O/H radical pool, which is typically controlled by the fuel oxida-
tion chemistry. To the extent the kinetic model is able to provide a
satisfactory description of the fuel oxidation chemistry, it would be
expected to predict the O/H radical pool fairly accurately. However,
under some conditions trace species chemistry has an impact on the
radical pool. For instance, the presence of nitrogen oxides may serve
to promote or inhibit fuel oxidation, depending on the conditions [4].
PA more direct interaction between the nitrogen chemistry and
the fuel oxidation chemistry involves reactions of hydrocarbon radi-
cals with N2 (forming prompt NO), with NO (reburn type reactions),
or with other reactive nitrogen species (for instance, converting
amines to cyanides). Almost any fuel derived radical, e.g., CH3, 3CH2,
1CH2, CH, and C among the C1-radicals and C2H, C2, HCCO, and C2O
from the C2-radical pool, may be involved in this interaction. Among
these radicals, methylidyne (CH) is of special interest since it is suffi-
ciently reactive to attack even molecular nitrogen and initiate
prompt NO formation.

PIn the present review, we limit our scope to nitrogen chemistry in
combustion of small hydrocarbons, mostly methane. In oxidation
of methane, the CH and C radicals are largely formed from the
sequence

CH3 ⟶

þH;OH 3CH2 ⟶

þH;OH

þH;OH
CH ⟶

C

In Appendix B, we take a look at the reactions that determine the
levels of the small hydrocarbon radicals and evaluate this part of the
reaction mechanism. Compared to previous modeling efforts, an
important feature in the present mechanism is the use of a more
accurate rate constant for CH + H2O.

3. Formation mechanisms for NO

3.1. Thermal NO

PThe thermal NO or Zeldovich mechanism [25] is the most impor-
tant source of NO in high-temperature gas combustion. The mecha-
nism of thermal NO formation is well established. The initiating step
is attack of an oxygen atom on the triple bond in N2,
O þ N2 @ NO þ N

ðR1bÞ
PThis reaction has a high activation energy, about 75 kcal mol(cid:1)1
[26], and it is the rate limiting step in thermal NO formation. Once
formed, the nitrogen atom is rapidly oxidized to NO by reaction with
OH or O2,
N þ OH @ NO þ H

ðR2Þ

N þ O2 @ NO þ O

ðR3Þ
PThe remaining issues in modeling thermal NO formation involve
mainly the accuracy of the rate constant for reaction R1, discussed
below.

formation. The rate constant for the rate limiting step (R1b) has

Fig. 3. Comparison between experimental data [52] and modeling predictions for for-
mation of NO from N2 and O2 in a flow reactor as a function of temperature and mole
fraction of O2 in the O2/N2 reactant gas mixture. Experimental data are shown as sym-
bols, while modeling predictions are shown as lines.

Pmeasured NO concentrations reported by Arai et al. with modeling
predictions. Interference of the quartz reactor surface with the NO
formation in these experiments is expected to be negligible. Loss
of atomic oxygen at the reactor wall, which could be a concern
(Appendix A), can be disregarded since O is rapidly equilibrated with
O2 under these conditions [46].

PThe agreement is within 20% or better. The differences are most
pronounced for the highest temperature at O2 levels above 30%,
where the predicted NO levels exceed the measurements. As pointed
out by Abian et al. [46], the observed NO profile at this temperature
has a different shape from those measured at other temperatures,
with NO peaking at a lower O2 concentration, and the difference
may be partly attributed to an experimental artifact.

PHomer and Sutton [53] reported measurements of NO concentra-
tion profiles
in atmospheric-pressure premixed hydrogen(cid:1)
oxygen(cid:1)nitrogen flames over a range of stoichiometries and tem-
peratures. Fig. 4 compares their experimental data with modeling
predictions. The flames of Homer and Sutton were heavily stabilized
on the burner and conceivably the burner surface affected the flames
by removing heat and radicals from the flame zone. Most of the NO
formation reported by Homer and Sutton occurs very early in the
flame, i.e. in a region where the flame may interact with the burner
surface. Following Abian et al. [46], we choose in the calculations to
fix the NO level at the measured value at about 0.25 cm above the
burner and model the NO formation only in the post-flame region to
minimize the uncertainty.

PThe flame data are scattered and there is some uncertainty in the
measured flame temperatures. However, the agreement between
observed and calculated NO concentrations in the post-flame region
is good.

PEven though the thermal NO subset can only be validated to a
limited extent due to the scarcity of suitable experimental data, the
uncertainty of calculations for this NO formation mechanism would
be expected to be small. The accuracy in the rate constant for the
rate limiting step (R1) is probably of the order of 25% at high temper-
atures and modeling predictions for thermal NO formation under
well-controlled conditions are likely to have a similar accuracy. In
practical systems, the accuracy of the calculations would be limited

Pto a greater extent by uncertainties in temperature and/or in turbu-
lence-chemistry interactions.

3.2. Prompt-NO

PThe mechanism initiated by attack of CHn-radicals on N2 is
termed prompt NO [29,54]. Prompt NO is an important, perhaps
dominating, source of NO in turbulent hydrocarbon/air diffusion
flames [55], which is the most common practical flame configura-
tion. Early modeling studies [1,24] identified the reaction of CH with
N2 as the most important initiation step. For a long time, this reac-
tion was believed to form HCN + N, but it is now known to proceed
via insertion of CH into the N2 triple bond, yielding NCN + H [56,57]:
ðR4Þ
CH þ N2 @ NCN þ H
POther hydrocarbon radicals have also been proposed to attack
molecular nitrogen. The reactions of both triplet and singlet methy-
lene (3CH2, 1CH2) with N2 have been shown to have too high barriers
to contribute to prompt NO formation [1,24,58]. Also, the C2O + N2
reaction, discussed in several publications [59(cid:1)62], has a prohibi-
tively high barrier [63]. The C2 + N2 reaction (R6) could be a candi-
date [64,65], but the low C2 concentration, typically two orders of
magnitude below the CH concentration in premixed flames [66],
prevents this step from being significant. Only the C + N2 reaction to
form CN + N (R5b) or NCN (R7b) is sufficiently fast to compete with
CH + N2 (R4). The direct step to form CN + N (R5b) has a higher acti-
vation energy than reaction R4 and becomes more competitive as
the combustion temperature increases, but also the sequence C + N2
(+M) ! NCN (+M) (R7b), followed by reaction of NCN, may contrib-
ute to NO formation. The C + N2 (+M) ! NCN (+M) reaction (R7b) is
exothermic (by 63.6 kcal mol(cid:1)1 at 298 K) and is exergonic up to
2100 K, becoming endergonic at higher temperatures, while C + N2
! CN + N (R5b) is both endothermic (by 17.4 kcal mol(cid:1)1 at 298 K)
and endergonic, with its endergonicity gradually growing as the
temperature rises.

PThe NCN radical formed by CH + N2 (R4) or C + N2 (R7b) feeds into
the cyanide pool and is eventually oxidized to NO or N2. Recent
modeling studies [60(cid:1)62,67(cid:1)72] have successfully included and

Prefined the NCN chemistry in the reaction mechanism for prompt NO
formation. However, there are still unresolved issues, as discussed
below.

P3.2.1. Heat of formation of NCN

PThe thermodynamic properties for NCN are important in model-
ing prompt-NO formation since they affect the branching fraction of
the NCN + H reaction towards CH + N2 (R4b) and HCN/HNC + N (R8,
R9). Values for the heat of formation of NCN used in modeling stud-
ies [61,62,67,71,72] vary more than three kcal mol(cid:1)1; differences
that have a significant impact on modeling predictions.

PTable 3 lists reported values of the heat of formation of NCN. Clif-
ford et al. [73] estimated DfH0
298(NCN) to 107.9 § 4.0 kcal mol(cid:1)1 from
electron affinity measurements measurements on NCN and a com-
puted (CBS-4, CBS-Q, and CBS-APNO) gas-phase acidity of HNCN.
Bise et al. [74,75] studied the photodissociation dynamics of NCN
using beam photofragment spectroscopy leading to DfH0
298 =
111.1 § 0.7 kcal mol(cid:1)1. Canneaux et al. [76] computed a value of
DfH0
298 = 107.2 § 0.8 kcal mol(cid:1)1 using CBS-QB3, CBS-APNO, G3B3, G3,
and G4 calculated atomization energies.

PRecently, Goos et al. [71] reexaminated the heat of formation of
NCN based on a detailed analysis of available experimental and theo-
retical thermochemical data combined with two Active Thermo-
chemical Tables analyses. As discussed at length by these authors,
the initial ATcT analysis using TN ver. 1.112, which included the
experimental and theoretical data available at the time, suggested a
tentative value of 106.5 § 0.4 kcal mol(cid:1)1 [79]. The value was reflect-
ing an irreconcilable discord between available experimental data
and was thus significantly influenced by several mid-level electronic
structure results, such as those of Canneaux et al. [76] (CBS-QB3,
CBS-APNO, G3B3, G3, G4), which appeared to be mutually consistent.
Upon repetition and further scrutiny of these (and other) single-ref-
erence computations, Goos et al. [71] established that these theoreti-
cal results for NCN (which is a 3S(cid:1)
biradical in the ground state)
suffer from significant spin contamination, a problem that escaped
notice by both Canneaux et al. [76] and Clifford et al. [73]. The value
proposed by Goos et al., 109.4 § 0.5 kcal mol(cid:1)1; was obtained by solv-
ing a small (localized) TN (ver. 1.112 bis) that included the conflict-
ing experimental data from Clifford et al. [73] and Bise et al. [74,75],
together with a couple of multi-reference results of Harding et al.
[77], but excluded all spin-contaminated single-reference theoreti-
cal results. As discussed by Goos et al., the data available at the time
produced a rather sparse TN, which subtended very few thermo-
chemical cycles involving NCN that would normally be exploited by
ATcT to check the individual determinations for consistency. As a
consequence, the ATcT statistical analysis of the TN could not find
clear fault with either of the two experimental studies and thus pro-
duced a result that was more-or-less mid-way between the two dis-
cordant experiments, which turned out to be in reasonable accord
with the value implied by the (included) multi-reference results of
Harding et al. [77]. (Parenthetically, when the content of the local-
ized TN is conjoined with the full TN, such as in ver. 1.118 [80], the
NCN-related local sparsity of the TN largely remains unchanged, and

Pthus the result changes rather insignificantly, to 109.1 kcal mol(cid:1)1.)
Since the proposed result deviates significantly from previous values
used in modeling studies, Goos et al. [71] tested its impact on
prompt NO formation, and concluded that the value obtained from
the localized TN did appear to somewhat improve the modeling of
NCN and NO mole fraction profiles in a fuel-rich methane flame
when compared to the high value of Bise et al. In addition, by sepa-
rately examining which range of values could be accommodated in
their modeling efforts, Goos et al. concluded that a feasible enthalpy
of formation of NCN should fall between 106.4 and 108.3 kcal mol(cid:1)1
- somewhat lower than the ATcT result from the localized TN -
but also indirectly suggesting that the experimental value of Clifford
et al. appears more acceptable than the high value of Bise et al.

POther previous modeling studies of prompt-NO have also
employed values for DfH0
298(NCN) that were varying by 3 or more
kcal mol(cid:1)1. Konnov [61] preferred the high value of 111 kcal mol(cid:1)1
from Bise and coworkers [74,75]. Desgroux and coworkers [62,67]
initially adopted the value of 107.9 kcal mol(cid:1)1 from Clifford et al.
[73], but in their most recent work [72] they find that the best agree-
ment with flame measurements is obtained with an even lower
DfH0

298(NCN) = 106.1 kcal mol(cid:1)1.
PIn the present work, we use the current ATcT value of DfH0
298
(NCN) = 107.7 § 0.2 kcal mol(cid:1)1 (see Section 2.1). The value is partially
based on new experimental and theoretical information. The rele-
vant new theoretical information emanates from recent high-accu-
racy computational results at the ANL1 level of theory [13], and was
added to the TN as appropriate isodesmic reactions; the new experi-
mental information is based on the 2nd and 3rd law interpretation
of the studies of Fassheber et al. [78]. The recent shock tube study by
Fassheber et al. on the NCN + H reaction supports a value of DfH0
298
(NCN) of approximately 107.5 kcal mol(cid:1)1; with an upper limit of
108.9 kcal mol(cid:1)1. The provenance of the current ATcT enthalpy of
formation (based on species-specific variance decomposition analy-
sis [81]) indicates that it indeed relies heavily on the new ANL1
results (which cumulatively contribute 76.5% to the provenance),
followed by the experimental study of Fassheber et al. (the 2nd and
3rd law contributing together 5.6%). Of note is also that the individ-
ual enthalpies of formation implied on one hand by the ANL1
computational results alone and on the other by the experimental
study of Fassheber et al. agree rather closely, and thus it is perhaps
no surprise that the current ATcT value is in excellent agreement
both with the latter experimental result and with ANL1 computa-
tions. The current ATcT value is also in admirable agreement with
the earlier result of Clifford et al. [73], but is outside the error bounds
of the determination of Bise et al. [74,75], reinforcing the conclusion
that the latter is too high. The current ATcT result is lower than the
previous ATcT result from a small localized TN reported by Goos
et al., but it falls comfortably in the middle of their deduced ‘feasible
range’ for the enthalpy of formation. Perhaps somewhat surprising
is that the current ATcT value also agrees well with the results
obtained from mid-level computations of Canneaux et al., given that
these veritably suffer from spin contamination in nearly every
computational step of their composite sequences.

P3.2.2. Reaction subset for prompt NO formation

PSelected reactions in the prompt NO subset are listed in Table 4.
Other important steps are formation and consumption of hydrocar-
bon radicals, discussed in Appendix B, and reactions in the cyanide
and amine subsets, discussed in the following sections.

Prate coefficients of the CH + N2 reaction in the 2500(cid:1)3800 K temper-
ature range. Their results are in good agreement, but the data from
Vasudevan et al. show less scatter. Lindackers et al. [91] also
reported measurements for the CH + N2 reaction from shock tube
experiments. However, they monitored formation of atomic N,
which is now known to be a product of secondary reactions, and
their results were disregarded in the present evaluation.

PHarding et al. [77] reported a high level theoretical study of the
CH + N2 reaction. They determined a value for k4 with an uncertainty
of a factor of two, owing mostly to the uncertainty in the heat of for-
mation for NCN. Recently, Klippenstein et al. [82] reanalyzed the
reactions on the HNCN potential energy surface. They obtained a
value for k4, adopted in the present work, that is slightly higher than
the rate constant from Harding et al. and the measurements of Vasu-
devan et al. (Fig. 5).

PKnowledge of the subsequent reactions of the NCN radical has
improved considerably in recent years, owing to a large degree to
the shock tube work of Friedrichs and coworkers who determined
rate constants for several of the NCN reactions, i.e., NCN + M (R7)
[83], NCN + H [78], NCN + O (R9) [83], NCN + O2 (R13) [85], and NCN
+ NO (R14) [86]. In addition, Lin and coworkers have studied theoret-
ically a number of reactions, including NCN + H [92], NCN + O [84],

PNCN + OH [93] and NCN + O2 [94]. Very recently, Klippenstein et al.
[82] reported a theoretical study of NCN + H and NCN + OH. The pres-
ent subset for NCN relies mostly on the experimental results of Frie-
drichs and coworkers and the theoretical work of Klippenstein et al.
PPrompt NO formation is most important under slightly reducing
conditions and the reaction with atomic hydrogen is a key step in
the NCN subset. In addition to recombination to form HNCN, this
reaction has three product channels,
NCN þ H @ CH þ N2

ðR4bÞ

NCN þ H @ HCN þ N

ðR8Þ

NCN þ H @ HNC þ N

ðR9Þ
PFassheber et al. [78] measured the overall rate constant for NCN +
H in a shock tube in the temperature range 962(cid:1)2425 K, while Vasu-
devan et al. [88] derived a rate constant for the sum of the channel to
HCN + N (R8) and HNC + N (R9) at 2300(cid:1)2500 K from measured time
histories of the NCN radical concentration. In addition, the NCN + H
reaction has been studied theoretically by Teng et al. [92] and by
Klippenstein et al. [82].

PIn Fig. 6 the measurements of Fassheber et al. and Vasudevan
et al. for NCN + H are compared with the high-level calculations of
Klippenstein et al. [82] for k4b, k8 + k9, and kNCNþH;total. The NCN + H
reaction is dominated by the channel to CH + N2 (R4b) at low to
medium temperatures, while HCN + N (R8) becomes competitive at
high temperatures. Since k4b has a negative temperature depen-
dence while k8 increases with temperature, the overall rate constant
for NCN + H has an inflection point, which occurs at temperatures
between 1000 and 1500 K.

PTeng et al. calculated a rate constant for reaction R8 in good
agreement with the measurements of Vasudevan et al., finding for-
mation of HNC + N (R9) to be of little importance due to a high bar-
rier. The analysis of Klippenstein et al. confirms that the channel to
HNC + N (R9) is minor, even though there may be a contribution
from inter-system crossing from 2HNCN to 4HNCN.

PThe value of k8 (+k9) inferred by Fassheber et al. from their
experiments is about a factor of two higher than indicated by the
data from Vasudevan et al. and the theoretical studies. However,
their overall rate constant for NCN + H is in good agreement with the
prediction of Klippenstein et al., in particular at high temperatures.

PIn the present work, we have adopted the rate constants for the
reactions on the HNCN potential energy surface from Klippenstein

Pet al. [82]. Their calculated values of k8 + k9 are below those derived
by Fassheber et al. [78] by more than a factor of three at 2000 K. This
difference has implications for modeling predictions of prompt NO
formation and more work is required to resolve this issue. The accu-
racy of the theoretical values is affected by uncertainty in the predic-
tion of the inter-system crossing probability for NCN + H and in the
thermodynamic properties for NCN and CH when extrapolated to
high temperatures [82].

PBoth experiment [83] and theory [84] support that the reaction of
NCN with O (R10) is fast and it is important for prompt NO forma-
tion. The NCN + OH reaction (R11, R12) has only been studied theo-
retically [82,93]; this step is slower and thus less important for NO
formation.

P3.2.3. Modeling prompt NO formation

PThe model for prompt-NO formation is evaluated by comparison
to data from low-pressure premixed flames [62,72,95(cid:1)99] and from
jet-stirred reactors [100]. The most comprehensive experimental
work on prompt NO formation in flames has been conducted by Des-
groux and coworkers in a series of publications [62,72,96(cid:1)99]. Data
from laminar, premixed flames are often very reliable, in particular
if obtained by non-intrusive methods. Concerns include the accuracy
of the measured temperature profile and possible interactions with
the burner surface. The well-stirred reactor device is characterized
by intense turbulent mixing, high concentrations of free radicals and
short residence times. These conditions favor prompt-NO formation
and make it the dominant source of NO at equivalence ratios ranging
from stoichiometric to fuel(cid:1)rich. However, data from jet-stirred
reactors are prone to be mixing influenced, in particular at high tem-
peratures where the chemistry is fast.

PFollowing Glarborg et al. [24] and Miller and Bowman [1], we
compare modeling predictions with the measurements of Bartok
et al. [100] on NO formation in combustion of CH4 in a jet-stirred
reactor (Fig. 7). In the calculations we have used the measured tem-
peratures, which peak at about 2000 K at slightly fuel-rich condi-
tions. Due to the concerns about mixing influence, the uncertainty in
the experimental results is presumably considerable. With this in
mind, the agreement between the experimental data and the

Pmodeling predictions is good, except at very fuel-rich conditions
where the NO concentration is underpredicted.

PAnalysis of the calculations for Fig. 7 provides information on how
the dominating NO formation mechanism is controlled by the stoichi-
ometry and the temperature. It is seen from the figure that if the
prompt-NO initiation reactions are deleted from the reaction mecha-
nism (dashed line), NO is still predicted well under lean conditions,
but under stoichiometric and reducing conditions it is severely
underpredicted. Thermal NO dominates under slightly lean condi-
tions, while NO formation through the nitrous oxide mechanism, dis-
cussed in Section 3.3, becomes more important as the amount of
excess air increases and the temperature decreases. Under stoichio-
metric conditions thermal NO and prompt NO contribute with similar
amounts of nitric oxide, but prompt NO rapidly becomes the domi-
nating source of NO for fuel(cid:1)air equivalence ratios larger than 1.0.

PFig. 8 shows a reaction path diagram for prompt NO formation
under slightly fuel-rich conditions. Prompt-NO formation involves
three overall steps [1,24]:

P(cid:4) formation of CHn-radicals, in particular CH
P(cid:4) molecular nitrogen fixation
P(cid:4) interconversion between fixed nitrogen species

PThe fixation of N2 occurs mainly through the CH + N2 reaction
(R4), even though recombination of C and N2 (R7b) also contributes.
Up to a fuel(cid:1)air equivalence ratio of approximately 1.2 the NCN and
N formed in these reactions are oxidized rapidly to NO, principally
by the sequence:

NCN þ H @ HCN þ N

HCN þ O @ NCO þ H

NCO þ H @ NH þ CO

NH þ H @ N þ H2

N þ OH @ NO þ H

PFig. 10 compares measured NO concentration profiles with
modeling predictions for six flames from Lamoureux et al. and Berg
et al. Despite differences between the two sets of flames, some com-
mon trends are seen. The measured NO increases with fuel(cid:1)air
equivalence ratio in these flames, ranging from about 5 ppm in the
lean flames (f = 0.80) to 25(cid:1)40 ppm in the fuel-rich flames (f =
1.25(cid:1)1.28). This is expected, since prompt NO is the controlling NO
formation mechanism in these flames, with temperatures in the
range 1750(cid:1)1980 K. The model predicts the NO profile quite accu-
rately under slightly lean conditions, but underpredicts NO under

where we see the largest discrepancy, the calculated NO is about a
factor of two below measurements.

PFig. 11 compares the measured and calculated CH-profiles from
the two sets of flames. Even though the equivalence ratios investi-
gated in the studies of Lamoureux et al. and Berg et al. are similar,
differences in pressure and temperature mean that the flames are
not directly comparable. Modeling predictions are generally in satis-
factory agreement with measurements. The only important differ-
ence is observed for the fuel-rich flame of Berg et al., where CH is
underpredicted by a factor of two. However, in the similar flame
from Lamoureux et al., CH is predicted quite accurately.

PFig. 12 shows results for the key nitrogen intermediates in
prompt NO formation for the flames of Lamoureux et al. The concen-
trations of HCN, NCN, and CN are all captured well by the model. The
largest discrepancy is seen for NCO, which is underpredicted in the
stoichiometric and the fuel-rich flame.

PTo bring the present modeling predictions in agreement with the
measured NO profile in the rich flame, the rate constant for the reac-
tion NCN + H ! HCN + N (R8) needs to be increased by more than a
factor of four, bringing it roughly in agreement with the determina-
tion from Fassheber et al. [78] and the optimized rate constant used
by Lamoureux et al. [72]. Such a change would be outside the esti-
mated 2s uncertainty of a factor of 1.5 for the theoretical rate

NH2.

PAt conditions richer than f = 1.2 the concentration of HCN
increases rapidly, while NO decreases. The shift in fixed nitrogen
partition from NO to HCN is caused by the combination of several
factors. The conversion of HCN to NO by reaction (R26) is no longer
rapid due to the decrease in O-atom concentration. Furthermore,
recycling of amine radicals and NO back to HCN through reaction
with hydrocarbon radicals becomes dominant. At richer conditions
the reactions of CH3 leading to CHn(cid:1)radicals are favored compared
to the oxidation pathways leading to formaldehyde. Reactions
between the CHn-radicals and NO then efficiently convert NO to cya-
nides and isocyanides. These steps are discussed in more detail in
Section 4.2 on reburning. Recycling of amine radicals into the cya-
nide pool occurs mainly through the fast reactions,
CH3 þ N @ H2CN þ H

CH3 þ NH @ CH2NH þ H

PFig. 9 shows a sensitivity analysis for NO for the conditions of the
experiments of Bartok et al. (Fig. 7). Results for three selected fuel(cid:1)air
equivalence ratios are shown. Under slightly lean conditions (f =
0.91), thermal NO contributes to formation of NO and the prediction
is sensitive to the O + N2 reaction (R1). Under slightly fuel-rich condi-
tions (f = 1.08), the importance of this step is diminished and under
even more reducing conditions (f = 1.27), it proceeds in the reverse
direction (N + NO ! N2 + O) and shows a negative coefficient.

PPrompt NO is an important source of NO under all three condi-
tions. The key reactions in the prompt NO mechanism, CH + N2 (R4),
NCN + H (R8, R9) and NCN + O (R10) exhibit positive sensitivity coef-
ficients. Reactions that promote formation of CH through the
sequence CH3 ! 3CH2 ! CH, i.e., CH3 + H (R99, R100b), CH3 + OH
(R103) and 3CH2 + H (R106), also show positive sensitivity coeffi-
cients, while steps breaking this sequence (mainly CH3 + O (R101)
and 3CH2 + OH (R107)) and steps competing with CH + N2 (R4) (pri-
marily CH + O2 (R113) and CH + H2O (R115)) inhibit NO formation.
Under reducing conditions, the reaction N + OH (R3) also becomes
important for NO formation.

PModeling predictions were compared to concentration profiles
for NO and relevant precursors from a series of low-pressure, lami-
nar premixed methane(cid:1)air flames. The experimental data were
obtained by Berg et al. [95] who detected CH and NO, and by Des-
groux and coworkers [62,72,96(cid:1)99], who in addition to CH and NO
reported concentration profiles for HCN, NCN, CN, and NCO. In both
flame studies methane was used as fuel, at pressures of 25(cid:1)30 and
40 torr, respectively, and over a range of equivalence ratios.

chiometric, 25 torr, T max = 1920 K) and 1.28 (rich, 30 torr, T max = 1980 K).

Pconstant [82]. While a high value for k8 is not supported by theory, it
is evident that the predictions of the present model deteriorates
under reducing conditions and more work is desirable to resolve
the differences. Preliminary calculations suggest that the underesti-
mate in the NO prediction for rich conditions may be related to
the reaction of CH3 with NCN, which is currently excluded from
the mechanism.

PPrediction of prompt NO formation requires an accurate rate con-
stant for the CH + N2 reaction (R4), as well as the ability to predict
both the CH concentration and the selectivity in the oxidation of
NCN to form NO or N2. The value of k4 is known to better than a fac-
tor of two, but the rate constants for important NCN reactions, in
particular NCN + H, are still in discussion. Consequently, the accu-
racy in predicting prompt NO formation in the combustion of meth-
ane or natural gas is probably not better than a factor of two. The
uncertainty in predictions for other hydrocarbon fuels may be even
larger, due to concerns about predicting accurately the concentra-
tion of CH [70].

3.3. The N2O and NNH mechanisms

PAdditional reaction paths to NO from atmospheric nitrogen
are initiated by recombination of N2 with atomic oxygen, O + N2
(+M) ! N2O (+M) [101], or atomic hydrogen, H + N2 (+M) !
NNH (+M) [102], followed by oxidation of the nitrogen interme-
diate to NO. The N2O scheme may be important under lean con-
ditions at high pressure and moderate temperatures, while the
NNH mechanism is most significant at slightly reducing condi-
tions and higher temperatures, perhaps in particular in diffusion
flames where NNH may form on the fuel-rich side of the flame
sheet and then react with O inside the flame sheet [103]. While
the N2O mechanism is quite well established, the importance of
NO formation through NNH remains controversial, as discussed
below.

NCN, CN, and NCO in low-pressure premixed methane/air flames. The symbols denote
experimental data, while the solid lines denote calculated values. Conditions: fuel(cid:1)air
equivalence ratios of 0.80 (lean), 1.0 (stoichiometric) and 1.25 (rich); pressure 40 torr.

P3.3.1. Reaction subset for NO formation via N2O

PThe N2O mechanism was proposed by Malte and Pratt [101]. It

involves the steps

O þ N2ðþMÞ @ N2OðþMÞ

N2O þ H @ NO þ NH

ðR15bÞ

ðR17bÞ

N2O þ O @ NO þ NO

ðR18Þ
PThe NH radical may react with OH or O2 to form NO, or react with
NO to form N2 or N2O. The NO forming reactions compete with steps
recycling N2O to N2,
N2O þ H @ N2 þ OH

ðR16Þ

N2O þ O @ N2 þ O2

ðR19Þ
PThe N2O subset of the mechanism is listed in Table 5. Data on the
association reaction between N2 and O (R15b) are very limited, but
the reverse reaction, dissociation of N2O (R15b), has been studied
experimentally over a wide range of conditions. The data, reviewed
by Baulch et al. [26], are in very good agreement. The selectivity for

Pforming NO or N2 from N2O is largely controlled by the branching
fractions of the reactions of N2O with H and O, respectively.

PThe N2O + H reaction was studied theoretically by Klippenstein
et al. [19]. Their calculated rate constant is in excellent agreement
with the measurements of Marshall et al. [105]. The reaction yields
predominantly N2 + OH (R16), except at very low temperatures
where addition occurs. The product channel to form NH + NO (R17b)
is only minor and reliable data for the forward reaction are scarce.
However, the NH + NO reaction has been studied extensively. The
reaction has two major product channels:
NH þ NO @ N2O þ H

ðR17Þ

NH þ NO @ N2 þ OH

ðR71Þ
PReported results for the overall rate constant for NH + NO are
summarized in Fig. 13. The low temperature measurements agree to
within a factor of two, and the data of Lillich et al. [106] and Rom-
ming and Wagner [107], which are in good agreement, serve to
extrapolate the data up to about 2200 K. Also the theoretical rate
constant from Klippenstein et al. [19] and the evaluation by Baulch
et al. [26] are shown, both for k17 + k71.

PExperimental [106,108(cid:1)112] and theoretical [19] data for the
branching ratio of the reaction show that N2O + H (R17) is dominat-
ing in the 300(cid:1)2200 K range, contributing 70(cid:1)90% of the total rate.
The N2 + OH channel (R71) accounts for 10(cid:1)30%; according to theory
this value increases only slightly with temperature [19].

PAt temperatures above 2200 K there are only two reported stud-
ies of NH + NO, both conducted in a shock tube using HNCO as a
source of NH. Mertens et al. [109] report overall rate measurements

et al. [116], Lillich et al. [106], Romming and Wagner [107], Geiger et al. [117], Klip-
penstein et al. [19] (k17 + k71) and Baulch et al. [26] (k17 + k71).

Psingle measurement at 3500 K. The data from Mertens et al., which
are in good agreement with those of Romming and Wagner in the
overlapping temperature range, indicate an increase in the rate con-
stant for NH + NO above 2200 K. The upturn in the rate constant is
not consistent with the measurement of Yokoyama et al. Their result
for kNHþNO at 3500 K is about a factor of three lower than the data of
Mertens et al., but in excellent agreement with the recommendation
of Baulch et al. for k17 + k71.

PBaulch et al. [26] attributed the high temperature increase
detected by Mertens et al. in the rate constant for NH + NO to a third
product channel,

NH þ NO @ NNH þ O

ðR23bÞ

This would require a rate constant for NNH + O (R23) close to colli-
sion frequency at high temperatures. While this would be in agree-
ment with early estimates [102,118,119], theoretical work [19,120]
indicates a value about an order of magnitude lower, making the
NNH + O channel (R23) insignificant for the overall rate of NH + NO.
Reaction R23 is discussed in detail in Section 3.3.2 below.

PWe have adopted the value for k17 + k71 and the branching frac-
tion k71/(k17 + k71) from Baulch et al. [26]; these rate coefficients are
in agreement with the theoretical work [19] withín the uncertainty,
but provide a slightly better agreement with the experiments of Lil-
lich et al. and Romming and Wagner in the temperature range of
interest in this study.

PFor the N2O + O reaction, the rate constant for forming NO + NO
(R18), measured both in the forward and reverse directions, and at
high temperatures also the overall rate constant are well established
[26,104]. However, the predicted formation of NO from N2O is sensi-
tive to the branching fraction of the N2O + O reaction between NO +
NO (R18) and N2 + O2 (R19) and the value of k19 has significant error
limits at intermediate temperatures [26]. In early evaluations by
Baulch et al. [121] and Hanson and Salimian [122], it was concluded
that k18 and k19 were similar over a wide temperature range. More
recently, this finding was questioned by Meagher and Anderson
[104]. From a reevaluation of the available experimental results,
they concluded that most likely reaction R19 had a significantly
smaller activation energy than R18, causing formation of N2 + O2 to
dominate at lower temperatures, while NO formation dominated at
temperatures above 1900 K.

PReported experimental results obtained at lower temperatures
do not support the conclusions of Meagher and Anderson regarding
k19. Kaufman et al. [123] conducted a batch reactor study of
decomposition of N2O and formation of NO at temperatures of
876(cid:1)1031 K. Their data indicate that the NO producing channel
(R18) constitutes at least 50% under these conditions. Meagher and
Anderson discarded the batch reactor results due to concern about
surface effects. However, according to Kaufman et al. an increase in
the surface/volume ratio resulted in a decrease, not an increase, in
formation of NO. The decrease in NO formation would be consistent
with loss of atomic oxygen on the quartz surface (see Appendix A).
In the present work, we have adopted the rate constant for reaction
R18 from the review of Meagher and Anderson [104], but tentatively
assumed that k18 = k19 based on the results of Kaufman et al. [123],
Dindi et al. [124], and Rohrig et al. [125]. A high activation energy for
reaction R19 is consistent with theoretical work [126], but more
work on this reaction is desirable.

PThe rate constant for NNH dissociation (R20) is discussed in more
detail in Section 4.1.1. With a lifetime of NNH of about 10(cid:1)9 s [19],
the NNH @ N2 + H reaction equilibrates rapidly. Thereby, the yield of
NO from the NNH mechanism becomes directly proportional to the
rate constant for NNH + O @ NH + NO (R23), as well as to the equilib-
rium constant KC, 20b for reaction R20b [19,127]. The equilibrium
constant KC, 20b depends on the heat of formation of NNH, which is
now well established at a value of DfH0
298(NNH) = 59.7 kcal mol(cid:1)1
[19]. Contrary to this, reported rate constants for the NNH + O !
NH + NO reaction (R23) vary by more than an order of magnitude, as
shown in Fig. 14.

PThere are no direct measurements of k23. The data shown from
Mertens et al. are calculated from their shock tube measurements of
kNHþNO by subtracting k17 + k71 and then converting the resulting
value for k23b to k23 through the equilibrium constant. Hayhurst and
Hutchinson reported values of k23 ¢ KC, 20b, derived from flame meas-
urements, with error limits of a factor of five; we have used the pres-
ent thermochemistry to obtain k23. Konnov and De Ruyck [128]
based their recommendation for k23 on a re-interpretation of flame
data from Harrington et al. [129] at 1200 K. Their value is compatible
with the results from Hayhurst and Hutchinson (1800(cid:1)2500 K) and
from Mertens et al.

PThese indirect experimental determinations of k23 all support a
value close to collision frequency. However, the theoretical studies
by Haworth et al. [120] and Klippenstein et al. [19] indicate a much
lower rate constant for reaction R23 (Fig. 14). In the present work,
we have drawn k23 from the theoretical study of Klippenstein et al.
[19]. This value has an estimated 2s uncertainty of a factor of two.

PThe implications of this choice for predicting NO formation through
the NNH mechanism is discussed below.

P3.3.3. Modeling NO formation from the N2O and NNH mechanisms

PUnder most conditions, formation of NO via N2O or NNH is a
minor source of nitric oxide compared to thermal NO and prompt
NO. For this reason experiments where the N2O or NNH mechanisms
dominate NO formation are scarce. To exclude the possibility of
prompt-NO formation, we select validation data only from non-
hydrocarbon systems, i.e. with H2 or H2/CO mixtures as fuel.

PFollowing Haworth et al. [120] and Klippenstein et al. [19], we
have selected the low-pressure, fuel-rich flames of Harrington et al.
[129] and the lean jet-stirred reactor experiments of Steele et al.
[130] for comparison with modeling predictions. The H2/air flames
of Harrington et al. were designed to minimize formation of NO
through thermal NO and N2O mechanisms while yielding measur-
able quantities of NO from NNH. To obtain this condition, the flames
were operated at comparatively low temperature (about 1200 K)
and under reducing conditions.

PIn Fig. 15, the measured NO profile from the 38 torr flame of Har-
rington et al. is compared with modeling predictions. The amount of
NO formed is very low, below 1 ppm. Even so, the model underpre-
dicts NO in the flame by almost an order of magnitude. We currently
cannot explain the difference between the observed and calculated
this flame. With a value of k23 of about
NO levels
1014 cm3 mol(cid:1)1 s(cid:1)1; the NO predictions become in agreement with
experiment. However, such a fast step appears to be incompatible
with the theoretical work [19,120], which clearly indicates that NH +
NO is only a minor channel of the NNH + O reaction.

for

PMalte and co-workers [101,130] have conducted a range of jet-
stirred reactor experiments to characterize NO formation in lean,
premixed combustion. While NO is mostly formed via N2O under
these conditions, the CO/H2 oxidation data of Steele et al. [130] is
sensitive also to NO formation from the NNH mechanism [19,120].
Fig. 16 compares measured and predicted NO and N2O concentra-
tions as a function of temperature. The model predicts both NO and
N2O within about 20%. Analysis of the calculations indicates that
the N2O mechanism dominates under the conditions of these

ory). The data from Mertens et al. are derived from their overall measurements of
kNHþNO; subtracting k17 + k71 and converting through the equilibrium constant. The
data from Hayhurst and Hutchinson are derived from their reported values of k23 ¢ KC,
20b, using the present thermochemistry.

Pmajor consumption steps for HCN are the reactions with O
(R27(cid:1)R29) and OH (R30(cid:1)R33). Both of these reactions are compli-
cated processes that involve multiple potential wells and multiple
product channels [1]. While rate constant and product channels are
fairly well established for the HCN + O reaction [1,20,144], few
experimental data are available for HCN + OH. Only the H-abstrac-
tion reaction R30 is well characterized experimentally [143]. For the
other product channels of HCN + OH (R31(cid:1)33), rate constants are
drawn from BAC-MP4 calculations by Miller and Melius [145].

PHydrogen isocyanide (HNC) has been proposed as an important
intermediate in oxidation of HCN in combustion [154]. At higher
temperatures, HCN and HNC equilibrate rapidly through isomeriza-
tion (R25), and, being more reactive than HCN, HNC offers an alter-
native route of oxidation for cyanides. The major issues regarding
HNC have been the energy separation to HCN, important for the pre-
dicted concentration of HNC when equilibrated with HCN, and the
rate constants for the reactions of HNC with OH and O2. Both the
thermodynamic properties of HNC and the key HNC reactions are
known more accurately due to recent work. Nguyen et al. [12] deter-
mined the energy difference between HCN and HNC at 298 K to be
15.1 § 0.1 kcal mol(cid:1)1; 2.2 kcal mol(cid:1)1 higher than that proposed in the
early study by Lin et al. [154] and 0.3 kcal mol(cid:1)1 higher than the rec-
ommendation of Dagaut et al.[20]. Reactions of HNC with OH (R36)
[149] and O2 [143] have been characterized theoretically and both
steps appear to be slower at relevant temperatures than assumed in
earlier modeling studies. In particular, Glarborg and Marshall [143]
report a high barrier of 44 kcal mol(cid:1)1 for the latter reaction, making
it irrelevant under most conditions of interest.

PCompared to the HCN subset from previous work [20,143], only a
few changes have been made. The most important of these concerns
the reaction of the CN radical with O2. This step is fast and the overall
rate constant is well established. However, the branching fraction to
the two product channels NCO + O (R37) and NO + CO (R38) has
been in discussion. Measurements of
the branching fraction
[150,155,156] are in good agreement at room temperature. Recently,
Feng and Hershberger [150] verified that the NO + CO channel (R38)
constituted 20% with little or no temperature dependence over the
range 296(cid:1)475 K, in contrast to earlier results from the same group
[156], and we have adopted their recommendation.

P3.4.2. Modeling HCN oxidation

PIn the following, modeling predictions for HCN oxidation are
compared to experimental results from flames (high temperature,

while the solid lines denote calculated values. Results are shown as a function of tem-

Pexperiments. However, augmented by the high levels of radicals in
the reactor, the NNH mechanism is also active, contributing about
25% to the formation of NO. It is noteworthy that modeling predic-
tions with a high rate constant for the NNH + O @ NH + NO reaction
(R23) leads to a substantial overprediction of NO under these condi-
tions [19,120].

PThe N2O mechanism is well established and predictions of NO
formed from this scheme would be expected to be quite accurate at
relevant temperatures and pressures. The main uncertainty relates
to the activation energy for N2O + O ! N2 + O2 (R19), which particu-
larly at lower temperatures has some impact on the calculated NO.

PThe prediction of NO from NNH is significantly more uncertain.
High level theoretical results for DfH0
298(NNH) [19] and for the NNH
+ O reaction [19,120] indicate that the NNH mechanism may be less
important than indicated by early modeling studies. Experimental
results [129,130] are inconclusive and additional experimental work
is called for to validate this subset.

3.4. Oxidation of HCN

PIn combustion processes, cyanides may be formed from reaction
of CH and C with N2 (the initiating steps in prompt NO formation),
from reaction of reactive nitrogen species such as NO or amines with
hydrocarbon radicals, from decomposition of hydrocarbon amines,
or from devolatilization of fuels with organically bound nitrogen
[1(cid:1)4,131]. The predominant cyanide species in combustion is hydro-
gen cyanide (HCN) and the oxidation chemistry of this component
has been studied extensively over the years [132(cid:1)143]. Much of this
work was reviewed by Dagaut et al. [20]. Recently the chemistry
was re-examined by Glarborg and Marshall [143], who emphasized
the role of the hydrogen isocyanide isomer HNC. The key issue in
HCN chemistry is the selectivity towards forming other nitrogen
species during oxidation, i.e., NH3, HNCO, NO, N2O, and N2.

Preducing conditions) and flow reactors (intermediate temperatures,
oxidizing conditions).

PFollowing Glarborg and Marshall [143], we compare modeling
predictions for the post-flame zone with measurements from a rich
ethylene flame doped with ammonia (Fig. 17). The conditions are
representative of the high-temperature region in fuel-rich combus-
tion prior to the rich-lean transition. The experimental data are from
Haynes [157] who investigated the decay of hydrogen cyanide in the
burnt gases of a number of fuel-rich, atmospheric pressure hydrocar-
bon flames, using nitrogen additives (ammonia or pyridine) as a
source of HCN. In the reaction zone of the flame, the additive would
be converted to HCN, with smaller amounts of NO. In the post-flame
zone, HCN was slowly converted to NH3. The temperature of the
burnt gases was 2000 K. In the modeling, it was assumed that both
ethylene and oxygen were depleted in the reaction zone, resulting in
an equilibrium mixture of CO, H2, CO2, and H2O entering the post-
flame zone together with measured concentrations of HCN, NH3,
and NO [143].

PThe modeling predictions are in good agreement with the meas-
urements for HCN, NH3, and NO. Hydrogen cyanide is consumed
through a two step sequence,

HCN þ M @ HNC þ M

ðR25Þ

HNC þ OH ! HNCO þ H
ðR36Þ
Under the conditions in the flame, HCN equilibrates rapidly with
HNC. Atomic hydrogen and to a lesser extent OH are the dominant
radicals in the flame but they consume little HCN because the reac-
tions HCN + H @ CN + H2 (R26b) and HCN + OH @ CN + H2O (R30)
are both rapidly equilibrated. The HNCO formed in reaction R36
feeds rapidly into the amine pool, eventually forming NH3:
HNCO þ H @ NH2 þ CO

ðR44Þ

NH2 þ H2 @ NH3 þ H

ðR53bÞ
PA smaller fraction of the NH2 is converted to NH and N through
the sequence NH2 ⟶þH NH ⟶þH N. The NH and N radicals may be
oxidized to NO by reaction with OH or react with NO to form N2O

Por N2. This competition results overall in a small decrease in NO con-
centration.

PIn combustion, HCN is oxidized to NO and N2 under excess air
conditions, typically in the presence of combustibles. Fig. 18 com-
pares flow reactor results from Hulgaard and Dam-Johansen [136]
and Glarborg and Miller [137] on lean oxidation of HCN with model-
ing predictions. The upper figure shows results for HCN oxidation in
the absence of combustibles [137], while the lower figure shows the
impact of adding CO as a reactant [136]. The agreement between
model and experiment is good. In the absence of CO, the conversion
of HCN to HNCO is underpredicted at lower temperatures, while pre-
dicted concentrations of NO and N2O at higher temperatures are
slightly too high.

PFig. 19 shows a reaction path diagram for HCN oxidation under
the conditions of Fig. 18. In the absence of CO, predictions are sensi-
tive to the generation of radicals. Due to the abundance of O2 and
H2O in the flow reactor experiments, representative of the burnout
region in combustion systems, H and O atoms are efficiently con-
verted to OH, which becomes the dominant chain carrier. This occurs
through the chain branching sequence H + O2 ! O + OH, O + H2O
! OH + OH. Consequently, removal of HCN is controlled primarily
by reaction with OH (R30), followed by a fast reaction of CN with O2
to form NCO + O (R37). The subsequent reactions of NCO largely
determine the fate of the N atom in the HCN oxidation process.
Under the conditions of Fig. 18 (upper), NCO reacts primarily with
H2O (R48b) at lower temperatures, thereby converting HCN to
HNCO. Due to low radical concentrations, consumption of HNCO is
very slow below 1150 K. As the temperature increases, the NCO +
H2O ! HNCO + OH reaction is reversed at longer reaction times. In
this way, reaction R48 becomes the main consumption channel for
HNCO as well as the main source.

Phigh temperature work of Hanson and coworkers [167(cid:1)170], and
theoretical work, e.g., [171,172].

PThe main consumption step for HNCO is the reaction with OH

[159],
HNCO þ OH @ NCO þ H2O

ðR48Þ
PThe rate constant for this reaction has been measured both at low
[162] and high [170] temperatures and the results are in good agree-
ment. Both experimental studies show that NCO + H2O is the major
product channel. The importance of a secondary product channel to
NH2 + CO2 has been in discussion, but the theoretical study of Sen-
gupta and Nguyen [172] indicates that this channel is negligible.

PThe reaction between HNCO and O2,

HNCO þ O2 @ HNO þ CO2

ðR49Þ

was proposed by Glarborg et al. [159] to explain the oxidation
behavior of HNCO in the absence of other combustibles. They
assumed an activation energy for reaction R49 of 35 kcal mol(cid:1)1. In
the present work we estimate the barrier for the addition of triplet
O2 to HNCO to be about 58.9 kcal mol(cid:1)1. The overall barrier for reac-
tion R49 might be even higher. Such a high barrier to reaction means
that the HNCO + O2 reaction is insignificant under the conditions of
interest here.

PAlternative reactions of HNCO include the self-reaction and the

reaction with H2O. Both of these reactions possibly yield CO2,
HNCO þ HNCO @ HNCNH þ CO2

ðR51Þ

HNCO þ H2O @ NH3 þ CO2

ðR50Þ
PReaction R51 has been studied both experimentally [164] and
theoretically [164,175] and data are in good agreement. The reaction
is too slow to contribute to HNCO consumption under most condi-
tions of interest. The rate constant for formation of the HNCO dimer
is predicted to be 1(cid:1)2 orders of magnitude faster [175], but the
dimer is not expected to be stable at elevated temperatures.

PHydrogenation of HNCO has been reported to occur readily in liq-
uid phase [176], but there are no measurements of the gas-phase
step. The reaction has been studied theoretically both in gas phase
[173,174,177] and aqueous phase [178]. Wei et al. [173] and Cheng
et al. [174] calculated barriers for R50 of 48.4 and 48.7 kcal mol(cid:1)1;
respectively; significantly higher than the value of 35.3 kcal mol(cid:1)1
predicted for the direct bimolecular reaction in aqueous phase [178].
Following Wei et al. [173] and Cheng et al. [174], we have included
the reaction with an activation energy of 48.5 kcal mol(cid:1)1.

Fig. 19. Reaction path diagram for oxidation of HCN under lean conditions.

PIn the presence of combustibles, here CO (Fig. 18 lower), the gen-
eration of chain carriers becomes less sensitive to reactions in the
HCN subset. The sequence CO + OH ! CO2 + H, H + O2 ! O + OH
acts as a source of radicals and shifts the HCN oxidation chemistry
towards lower temperatures. It also suppresses the formation of
HNCO. Since OH reacts rapidly with CO, atomic oxygen now assumes
a more important role in the HCN oxidation. Reaction of HCN with O
(R27, R28) becomes competitive with HCN + OH (R30) in removing
HCN, and a minor oxidation route now proceeds through the amine
pool via reaction R28. The increased O-atom concentration also
shifts the balance between the NCO + O and NCO + NO reactions and
causes a comparatively larger fraction of HCN to be oxidized to NO
at higher temperatures.

PFor most practical purposes, the HCN oxidation chemistry is suffi-
ciently well established. Hydrogen cyanide is very seldom a stand-
alone combustible and the radical pool will typically be controlled
by the oxidation of the main fuel or fuel intermediates, not by the
HCN chemistry. The selectivity in HCN oxidation for forming NO,
HNCO, NH3, N2O, or N2 is predicted fairly accurately by the present
model.

3.5. Oxidation of HNCO

PIsocyanic acid (HNCO) is an important intermediate in fuel nitro-
gen oxidation [1,3,20,137(cid:1)139]. It is also important in selective non-
catalytic reduction of NO with cyanuric acid and urea, as it is a pri-
mary decomposition product of both these agents [152,158]. Previ-
ous modeling studies of HNCO oxidation [159] and reduction of NO
by HNCO [1,152,159,160] have provided an understanding of the
HNCO chemistry, but efforts to develop a reliable prediction tool
have to some extent been hampered by the limited availability of
suitable experimental data.

P3.5.1. Reaction subset for HNCO oxidation

PTable 8 lists selected reactions from the HNCO subset of the
chemical kinetic model. The subset is mostly based on previous
modeling studies by the authors [1,20,21,152,159], as well as on
the evaluation by Baulch et al. [26]. Rate constants for several of the
HNCO consumption reactions are fairly well established due to
the low temperature work of Perry and coworkers [161,162], the
medium-to-high temperature work of Lin’s group [163(cid:1)166], the

P3.5.2. Modeling HNCO oxidation

PThe only experimental study of HNCO oxidation is the flow reac-
tor work of Glarborg et al. [159]. However, results for the reduction
of NO by HNCO (RapReNOx) are also of importance for understanding
the HNCO chemistry; these are discussed in Section 4.1.2. Glarborg
et al. investigated HNCO oxidation in the absence and presence of
CO in the temperature range 1025(cid:1)1425 K at atmospheric pressure.

Penhance oxidation, similarly to what is observed for HCN (see Sec-
tion 3.4). The isomerization pathways for HNCO have been studied
theoretically by several groups [108,179,180] who find the pathway
to HOCN to be energetically the most favorable. However, the overall
barrier height is of the order of 90 kcal mol(cid:1)1; which is too high for
the process to be significant at the present temperatures. Even
though quartz surfaces are believed to be inert towards HNCO
[158,160,181], it cannot be excluded that oxidation is promoted by
heterogenous reactions on the surface.

PFig. 20 (lower) shows results for HNCO oxidation in the presence
of CO. The impact of CO on HNCO oxidation is similar to the effect it
has on HCN oxidation, discussed in Section 3.4. The presence of CO
enhances the consumption rate of HNCO significantly and isocyanic
acid is completely oxidized already at 1200 K, forming considerable
amounts of NO and N2O, in addition to N2. The model describes the
observations well. The predicted onset of reaction is slightly prema-
ture, but the product concentrations are in good agreement with
experiment.

PThe CO oxidation chemistry acts to replenish the radical pool and
shifts the chemistry towards lower temperatures. Similar to what
was seen for HCN oxidation, this happens through the chain branch-
ing sequence CO + OH @ CO2 + H, H + O2 @ O + OH, O+H2O @ OH +
OH. Oxidation of CO is slightly inhibited by the presence of HNCO
due to the chain terminating NCO reactions and the competition for
OH(cid:1)radicals between CO and HNCO. For this reason, CO enters the
rapid oxidation regime only after most of the HNCO is depleted.

PFig. 21 shows a pathway diagram for oxidation of HNCO in the
presence of CO. Isocyanuric acid is consumed primarily by reaction
with OH (R49), forming NCO. The NCO radical subsequently reacts
either with O to form NO (R40) or with NO to form N2O (R42) and N2
(R43). At temperatures above 1250 K formation of N2O diminishes
while consumption reactions, in particular thermal dissociation,
become competitive, causing a decrease in N2O.

PSimilar to HCN, the reliability of the HNCO oxidation subset of the
model is sufficient for most practical purposes. In combustion sys-
tems, HNCO is only a minor reactive nitrogen species, formed either
in devolatilization of solid fuels or from partial oxidation of cyanides.
The uncertainty in the HNCO oxidation chemistry is mainly related
to the slow oxidation occurring in the absence of other combustibles.
However, as discussed in more detail in Section 4.1.2, selective non-
catalytic reduction of NO by cyanuric acid or urea is sensitive to the

Fig. 21. Reaction path diagram for oxidation of HNCO under lean conditions.

Fig. 20. Comparison of experimental data [159] and modeling predictions for HNCO
oxidation in a quartz flow reactor, without (upper figure) and with (lower figure) CO in
the inlet. Experimental data are shown as symbols, modeling predictions as lines. The
data have been normalized by the inlet HNCO concentration, calculated from a carbon
balance (HNCO + CO + CO2). Inlet mole fractions: upper figure HNCO = 228(cid:1)336 ppm
(320 ppm in the calculations), O2 = 5.6%, H2O = 0.5%; lower figure HNCO =
343(cid:1)516 ppm (480 ppm in the calculations), CO = 730 ppm, O2 = 5.5%, H2O = 0.5%;
balance N2. P = 1.05 atm. Reaction time = 0.10 s at 1200 K (constant mass flow). The
reactor surface/volume ratio was 4.4 cm(cid:1)1.

PFig. 20 compares experimental results and predictions with the pres-
ent model. Unfortunately, the source of HNCO in the experiments (cid:1)
saturation of a nitrogen stream at 195 K (cid:1) was not completely stable,
but the scatter in the data is limited. In order to facilitate interpreta-
tion, the experimental results are presented on a normalized basis in
the figure, using the calculated concentrations of inlet HNCO. The
corresponding calculations are carried out for each set with a fixed
inlet composition.

PFig. 20 (upper) shows results on HNCO oxidation in the absence
of combustibles. Consumption of HNCO proceeds very slowly at tem-
peratures below 1250 K. Above 1250 K the HNCO decay is faster, but
even at 1400 K only of the order of 50% of the inlet HNCO is con-
sumed. Oxidation of HNCO leads to concentrations of CO2 that are
consistently larger than those of CO. Nitric oxide and N2O constitute
a comparatively small fraction of the products.

PThe model severely underpredicts the consumption rate of
HNCO. The low predicted oxidation rate for HNCO even at high tem-
perature is due to the fact that the major oxidation route for HNCO
under these conditions is chain terminating. The OH radical is the
main chain carrier, and HNCO is mainly consumed by the HNCO +
OH reaction (R48), forming NCO and H2O. The NCO radical is con-
sumed by reaction with O (R40) and, at higher temperatures, possi-
bly also O2 (R41). These reactions are chain terminating and inhibit
the oxidation process. Isocyanide oxidation is negligible even at
it proceeds exclusively through this sequence. The
1400 K,
observed consumption of HNCO, and the formation of CO2 rather
than CO, support the importance of a reaction between HNCO and
another stable species, i.e., O2 (R49), H2O (R50), or HNCO (R51).
However, all of these steps appear to be too slow to account for the
observed reaction. Formation of isomers of HNCO could potentially

PHNCO subset, and here the uncertainties in this chemistry limit the
predictive capability of the model.

3.6. Oxidation of NH3

PAmmonia is the key volatile-N species in combustion. It is formed
in devolatilization of solid fuels [3] or from conversion of cyanides at
higher temperatures [1,3,131,157]. At the rich-lean transition in
staged combustion processes, NH3 rather than HCN governs the
nitrogen chemistry and controls the selectivity for forming NO and
N2 [182].

PA number of modeling studies and reviews on ammonia oxida-
tion chemistry have been reported, e.g. [1,19,48,146,183(cid:1)185]. In
addition, the chemistry of selective non-catalytic reduction of NO by
reaction with ammonia has been studied extensively (see Sec-
tion 4.1.1). However, the development of reliable models for ammo-
nia oxidation in combustion and flue gas cleaning has been
hampered partly by issues concerning key reactions, in particular
the branching fraction of the NH2 + NO reaction and the lifetime of
NNH [1,19], and partly by the strong sensitivity of ammonia to surfa-
ces, potentially limiting the accuracy of reactor experiments (see
Appendix A).

P3.6.1. Reaction subset for NH3 oxidation

PTable 9 lists selected reactions in the amine subset of the chemi-
cal kinetic model. This subset was based mostly on the recent work
by Klippenstein et al. [19], which again drew on previous modeling
studies [22,48,186(cid:1)189]. For many of the key reactions in the
ammonia subset, rate constants have been calculated by Klippen-
stein and coworkers using high-level theory. These include NH2 +
NO [190,191] and NH2 + NO2 [192], reactions on the ONNH potential
energy surface (NH + NO, NNH + O, N2O + H) [19], reactions of NH2
and NNH with O2 [19], and NH2 + OH [193].

PIn the absence of hydrocarbons, ammonia is largely consumed by
H-abstraction reactions with the O/H radical pool (R53(cid:1)R55); these
steps are all characterized experimentally over a wide temperature
range. The subsequent reactions of the NH2 radical have a large
impact on the consumption rate for NH3 and on the selectivity for

Fig. 22. Arrhenius plot for the reaction NH2 + NO ! products. The symbols denote
measurements of the rate constant while lines denote theoretical values. The data are
drawn from Silver and Kolb [205], Stief et al. [206], Atakan et al. [207], Wolf et al.
[208,209], Song et al. [201,204], and Klippenstein [191].

Pforming NO and N2. Owing to the low reactivity of NH2 towards O2,
the key step in the presence of even small amounts of NO is the fast
NH2 + NO reaction. Due to the importance of this reaction in the
SNCR process (Section 4.1.1), it has been studied extensively in the
past [203]. An Arrhenius plot for the overall reaction between NH2
and NO is shown in Fig. 22. The reaction has been measured over a
wide temperature range, and data agree roughly within a factor of
two. The experimentally based value of Song et al. [204] and the the-
oretical rate constant from Klippenstein [191], which both provide
an accurate representation of available measurements, are slightly
lower than the value of Miller and Glarborg [188] used in our recent
modeling work [19].

PThe NH2 + NO reaction has two product channels,

NH2 þ NO @ NNH þ OH

ðR65Þ

NH2 þ NO @ N2 þ H2O

ðR66Þ
PReaction R65 is chain branching while R66 is in effect terminat-
ing, and for this reason, modeling predictions are very sensitive to
the branching fraction for the reaction, defined as a = k65/(k65 + k66).
Fig. 23 compares experimental data for the branching fraction with
the theoretical ratio from Miller and Klippenstein [190] and Klippen-
stein [191]. The recent experimental data [201,204,210(cid:1)213] and
the theoretical values are in very good agreement.

PIn the present work, we have adopted the rate constants for reac-
tions R65 and R66 from Song et al. [201]. Their branching ratio was
chosen to match the theoretical value from Miller and Klippenstein
[190]. In the temperature window for the Thermal DeNOx process
(around 1250 K), this value is slightly lower than the value of the
CASPT2 calculation from Klippenstein [191] (see Fig. 23). Due to the
very high sensitivity to a in modeling predictions for Thermal
DeNOx, even a very small change has a significant impact (see
Section 4.1.1).

PAt large excess air ratios, the HO2 radical may be formed in signif-
icant quantities, promoting oxidation of NO to NO2. This occurs via
the reaction NO + HO2 @ NO2 + OH, which is well characterized both
in the forward [26,215] and reverse [216] direction. The NH2 + NO2
reaction has been studied over a wide range of temperature. Similar
to NH2 + NO, it has two major product channels,

PAlso the branching fraction for the NH2 + NO2 reaction, defined as
k67/(k67 + k68), has been in discussion but most studies support a
value around 20% [223,225(cid:1)229], in agreement with the theoretical
analysis of Klippenstein et al. [192].

PCompeting consumption steps of NH2 include reactions with the
O/H radical pool (R57(cid:1)R61), with amine radicals leading to forma-
tion of N2-amines, and, at high excess oxygen levels, with O2 (R62,
R63). The NH2 + H reaction (R57b) has been measured both in the
forward [230,231] and reverse [199,232] direction at elevated tem-
peratures. The data for the NH + H2 reaction [199,232] is in excellent
agreement over an extended temperature range and consistent with
the only low temperature measurement of k57b [233]. The NH2 + O
reaction (R58, R59) has only been measured at low temperature
where the overall rate constant has been shown to be fast
[234(cid:1)236] and HNO + H (R58) is the dominating product channel,
with a minor contribution from NH + OH (R59) [234,235]. Based on
unpublished data by Temps (cited by Miller et al. [183]), we have
assumed a T(cid:1)0:5 temperature dependence for reaction R58. Since the
NH2 + O reaction is important for formation of NO from NH3 at high
temperatures, a measurement of the rate of this step at elevated
temperature is desirable. The NH2 + OH reaction (R60) was studied
experimentally and theoretically by Klippenstein et al. [193].

PThe NH radical, formed by hydrogen atom abstraction from NH2,
may react with NO to form N2O (R17) or N2 (R71), as discussed in
Section 3.3.1, or with O2 leading to formation of NO,
NH þ O2 @ NO þ OH

ðR70Þ

NH þ O2 @ HNO þ O

ðR69Þ

The competition between the different consumption reactions of
NH is important for the overall selectivity for forming NO or N2 in
ammonia oxidation, in particular at higher temperatures.

PUnder conditions with high O2 concentrations [19] or high pres-
sure [237], nitroxide (H2NO) may be formed in significant quantities
from reaction of NH2 with HO2 or NO2. The H2NO subset of the reac-
tion mechanism is not well established and consists largely of reac-
tions with estimated rate constants. The most important reaction of
H2NO is that with O2,
H2NO þ O2 @ HNO þ HO2

ðR72Þ
PThere are no experimental data available for this reaction.
Recently, it was studied theoretically by Song et al. [237] who calcu-
lated the rate constant from ab initio theory. To facilitate modeling
predictions of NH3 oxidation and Thermal DeNOx at high oxygen
concentrations, we have lowered the activation energy for reaction
(R72) by 2.5 kcal mol(cid:1)1; this change is within the estimated uncer-
tainty in the calculated barrier height.

PAlso for HNO, reaction with O2 (R73) is an important consump-
tion step. For this reaction we rely on a rate constant derived from
QRRK theory [146]. Experimental determinations of the rate con-
stants for both HNO + O2 and H2NO + O2 are desirable.

P3.6.2. Modeling NH3 oxidation

POxidation of ammonia has been studied extensively in the past,
both experimentally and through modeling. The experimental work
include studies in flames [238(cid:1)245], shock tubes [185,246(cid:1)253]
and flow reactors [136,140,237,254,255].

PDue to the potential impact of surface reactions on the induction
time in NH3 oxidation even for quartz (see [254] and Appendix A),
flow and batch reactor experiments can be used only cautiously for
model validation. For this reason, we supplement flow reactor data
with results from experiments conducted in premixed flames and
shock tubes for validation of the NH3 oxidation subset.

PFollowing Miller and Bowman [1], we evaluate the model against
the low-pressure flame data of Bian et al. [244]. They measured the
structure of a flame burning in a near equimolar ammonia(cid:1)oxygen

1.3 ¢ 1016 T(cid:1)1:216 exp((cid:1)1360/T); k66 = 3.3 ¢ 1021 T(cid:1)3:029 exp((cid:1)588/T) (MRCI+Q).

PValues for the overall rate constant have been reported over a wide
range of conditions [192,217(cid:1)226], but the scatter in the data is con-
siderable. However, even though data at 500 K differ by more than
an order of magnitude (Fig. 24), most recent determinations are in
fairly good agreement. The rate constant calculated by Klippenstein
et al. [192] provides a good description of most of the data below
1000 K, but it is a factor of three below the high temperature
(1300(cid:1)1600 K) shock tube determination of Song et al. [226]. In the
present work, we have adopted the overall rate constant from Glar-
borg et al. [223], which is compatible with the rate constants from
both Song et al. and Klippenstein et al. within their uncertainties.

Pthe mechanism. This subset is quite uncertain and more work on the
N2-amine chemistry is desirable.

PIn the presence of even small amounts of NO, NH3 oxidation
becomes insensitive to initiation reactions and the impact of the sur-
face in flow reactor experiments is minimized [1,159]. Fig. 28 shows
results for NH3 oxidation in the presence of NO varying in the range
25(cid:1)100 ppm, with the NH3 and O2 inlet levels maintained at
1000 ppm and 40%, respectively [256]. The onset temperature for
reaction is independent of the NO level. Even at the smallest NO con-
centration of 25 ppm, a minimum in NO is observed just above the
initiation temperature, and inspection of the data shows that the
fractional conversion of NO at the minimum is quite similar over
the range of NO levels from 25 to 100 ppm. At higher temperatures
( > 1200 K), the exit NO concentration asymptotically approaches a
value, which is independent of the inlet level. A similar observation
was reported by Lyon and Benn [257]. The modeling predictions cap-
ture all these trends well.

Pmixture at reduced pressure (35 Torr), using using a molecular beam
sampling technique coupled with a mass spectrometer. Fig. 25 com-
pares the measured species profiles with modeling predictions.

POverall, the agreement between the experimental results and the
modeling predictions is good. The concentrations of both reactants
(NH3, O2) and products (NO, N2O, N2, and H2O) are predicted quite
accurately, while calculations for the amine radicals NH2 and NH are
within the experimental uncertainty. The only major discrepancies,
not shown, occur for HNO and N, which are both severely overpre-
dicted.

PFig. 26 shows a reaction path diagram for oxidation of NH3.
Ammonia is converted to NH2 by reaction with the radical pool.
The NH2 radical may be converted to NH and N in the sequence
NH2 ⟶þOH;H NH ⟶þOH;H N; these reactions become more competitive
with increasing temperature. Subsequently, the NHi radicals may
react with NO, leading to N2, or with O, OH, or O2, forming NO. The
selectivity for forming NO or N2 in oxidation of ammonia is deter-
mined by the competition of the amine radicals for reacting with NO
or with the O/H radical pool (or O2).

PMathieu and Petersen [185] measured the ignition delay for NH3
as a function of stoichiometry and pressure. In Fig. 27, their results
for a pressure of 1.4 atm are compared with modeling predictions.
The calculations are in good agreement with measurements at lean
and rich conditions, but curiously show a larger deviation at stoi-
chiometric conditions. As pointed out by Mathieu and Petersen, the
predicted ignition delays for NH3 are sensitive to the N2Hx subset of

Fig. 28. Comparison of experimental data [256] and modeling predictions for oxida-
tion of NH3 in a quartz flow reactor: effect of inlet NO concentration. Symbols denote
experimental data, while solid lines denote modeling predictions. Inlet concentra-
tions: NH3 = 1000 § 100 ppm, O2 = 40 § 1.2%, H2O = trace, NO varying (25, 50,
100 ppm); balance N2. Residence time (s) = 48.7/T[K].

PThe comparisons with the flame structure data (Fig. 25), the
shock tube ignition delays (Fig. 27), and the flow reactor data
(Fig. 28) indicate that the important features of NH3 oxidation,
including the selectivity for forming NO and N2, are described well
by the model. However, in combustion processes ammonia formed
from fuel(cid:1)nitrogen will typically be present only in small amounts
compared to other combustibles. The oxidation chemistry of these
combustibles will control the generation of chain carriers, and, par-
ticularly under reducing conditions, hydrocarbon/amine interactions
may be important.

PFig. 29 compares modeling predictions with the experimental
results from Mendiara and Glarborg [22] for oxidation of CH4 doped
with NH3 in a flow reactor as a function of temperature and stoichi-
ometry. The conditions of these experiments are expected to be
more representative of practical combustion systems. The methane
inlet level was about 2500 ppm, with about 500 ppm NH3. The stoi-
chiometry is seen to have a major impact on the NO formation.
Under fuel-rich conditions, the amount of NO formed is negligible.
Carbon monoxide is formed above 1230 K and reaches a plateau
level at a temperature close to 1300 K. Ammonia oxidation is initi-
ated at 1130 K, but the consumption rate of NH3 is slow until CH4 is
completely converted to CO. For stoichiometric conditions, the initi-
ation of the reaction occurs at a slightly lower temperature. Nitric
oxide is formed following the disappearance of NH3, reaching a level
of 180 ppm at 1400 K and then leveling out. Carbon monoxide exhib-
its a peak at 1230 K and then reaches a plateau. For fuel-lean condi-
tions, reaction is initiated at much lower temperatures. Carbon
monoxide peaks already at 1030 K, and no CO is observed above
1075 K. Following the depletion of NH3 at about 1050 K, NO is
formed. The NO concentration increases with temperature up to
1250 K and then levels out.

PModeling predictions are generally in good agreement with
experiments. The model captures well the initiation of methane and
ammonia oxidation and the onset of NO formation, except under
lean conditions where the onset temperature is underpredicted. The
amount of NO formed is predicted quite accurately over the range of
temperature and stoichiometry.

Fig. 29. Comparison of experimental data [22] and modeling predictions for oxidation
of a mixture of CH4 and NH3 as a function of stoichiometry and temperature. Symbols
denote experimental data, while solid lines denote modeling predictions. Inlet con-
centrations (reducing (f = 1.55) / stoichiometric (f = 1.07) / oxidizing (f = 0.13)): CH4
= 2508 / 2513 / 2515 ppm, O2 = 3480 / 5040 / 40100 ppm, NH3 = 484 / 468 / 468 ppm;
balance N2. All experiments were conducted in a 12 mm inner diameter alumina reac-
tor at 1.05 atm with a residence time in the isothermal zone of 1296/T(K).

PThe presence of hydrocarbons opens up additional oxidation
pathways for NH3, compared to the diagram in Fig. 26. These interac-
tions are discussed in more detail elsewhere [22,131,189]. In partic-
ular the methyl radical plays an active role, converting amine
radicals to hydrocarbon amines,
CH3 þ NH2ðþMÞ @ CH3NH2ðþMÞ

CH3 þ NH @ CH2NH þ H

and hydrogen cyanide to acetonitrile,
CH3 þ HCN @ CH3CN þ H

PThe level of accuracy shown in Fig. 29 is presumably representa-
tive of the reliability of the model in simulating ammonia oxidation,
in particular the selectivity for forming NO and N2, in most practical
systems. This is encouraging, as NH3 can be considered the most
important fuel(cid:1)nitrogen species in the gas-phase. However, the
interaction of NH3 with the hydrocarbon oxidation chemistry,
particularly under
is quite complicated
[22,131,189] and uncertainties in this chemistry may limit the accu-
racy of modeling predictions under reducing conditions.

PAs legislation on nitrogen oxide emissions becomes increasingly
stringent, primary measures based on staged combustion may
become inadequate, making it necessary to employ either catalytic
flue gas cleaning or in-situ control technologies such as selective
non-catalytic
SNCR
[1,152,258,259] and reburning [21,260(cid:1)273] have been studied
extensively. They are available as commercial technologies, typically
offering NOx reductions of the order of 50% [274]. In the following
sections, the chemistry of these processes are outlined and the reli-
ability of the model in describing the NO reduction is evaluated.

4.1. Selective non-catalytic reduction of NO

PSelective, non-catalytic reduction of NO (SNCR) is widely used for
NOx control in combustion of fuels such as biomass and waste,
where catalytic cleaning may be prohibitive due to poisoning of the
catalyst. The reducing agents used to react with NO are ammonia,
urea and cyanuric acid. Also ammonium sulfate has been proposed
[274], but little is known about the performance of this agent.

P4.1.1. SNCR with NH3 (Thermal DeNOx)

PSelective, non-catalytic reduction of NO using NH3 as the reduc-
ing agent was developed by Lyon [258] who termed the process
Thermal DeNOx. The chemistry of Thermal DeNOx has been studied
extensively [1,19,187,188,258,259,275(cid:1)277]. Characteristic of the
process is that nitric oxide removal is possible only in a narrow tem-
perature range centered at 1250 K and only in the presence of oxy-
gen. At temperatures below 1100 K, reaction is too slow to be
significant, and above 1400 K the NH3 is oxidized to NO rather than
to N2.

PThe kinetic model for Thermal DeNOx is the same as that for the
H/N/O chemistry discussed in previous sections. The major differ-
ence between the present subset, adopted largely from Klippenstein
et al. [19], and previous kinetic models for Thermal DeNOx, e.g.,
[1,188], is that the chain branching in the process is now mainly
restricted by the small value of the branching fraction a of the NH2 +
NO reaction, rather than by reactions of NNH with O2 or NO. Follow-
ing Klippenstein et al. [19], we use a value for the NNH lifetime of
10(cid:1)9 s, much lower than values commonly used in modeling. This
value corresponds to k20 = 1 £ 109 s(cid:1)1. A lower limit rate for prompt
dissociation can be estimated to around 2 £ 108 s(cid:1)1. An accurate
determination of the dissociation rate for NNH (R20) would be very
valuable for modeling ammonia oxidation and selective non-
catalytic reduction of NO.

PFig. 30 compares experimental and modeling results for the Ther-
mal DeNOx process. The upper figure shows data obtained in a lami-
nar flow reactor [278], while the results in the lower figure were
obtained in a jet-stirred reactor [276]. Despite the difference in reac-
tion conditions, the temperature window for the process is similar
in the two reactor configurations. Presence of water vapor is seen to
have only a limited impact on the process.

PThe present model provides a satisfactory prediction of the
experimental results, even though it predicts a larger impact of H2O
than observed experimentally. While NO is predicted fairly accu-
rately in the presence of water vapor, in particular for the flow reac-
tor conditions, the model tends to underpredict the temperature for
onset of reaction in the absence of H2O. The reason for this discrep-
ancy is not clear. Loss of atomic oxygen on the reactor wall under
dry conditions could conceivably play a role; this is discussed in
Appendix A. The predicted inhibition by water vapor is mostly
caused by its high collider efficiency in the reaction H + O2 + M !
HO2 + M. Presently, the collider efficiency is based on low tempera-
ture measurements, but there is likely a considerable temperature
dependence to it.

Fig. 30. Comparison of experimental data [276,278] and modeling predictions for
reduction of NO by NH3: effect of H2O concentration. Symbols denote experimental
data, while solid lines denote modeling predictions. Upper figure (laminar quartz flow
reactor [278]): Inlet concentrations: NH3 = 832 ppm, NO = 507 ppm, O2 = 4.0%, H2O =
0% or 2.8% or 10%, balance N2. Residence time (s) = 92.7/T(K). Lower figure (jet-stirred
reactor [276]): Inlet concentrations: NH3 = 960 ppm, NO = 400 ppm, O2 = 0.8%, H2O =
0% or 3%, balance N2. Nominal residence time (s) = 370/T(K).

PFig. 31 shows a pathway diagram for the Thermal DeNOx process
in the presence of water vapor. Ammonia is converted to NH2 by
reaction with the O/H radical pool, primarily OH (R55). The subse-
quent reaction between NH2 and NO is the key step in the process.
This reaction must simultaneously remove NO and produce free rad-
icals to sustain reaction [1,19]. As discussed above, it has two prod-
uct channels

PDissociation of NNH initiates a reaction sequence, which secures
that reaction R65 ads to a net formation of three hydroxyl radicals
[1,19]:
NNH @ N2 þ H
H þ O2 @ O þ OH
O þ H2O @ OH þ OH

ðR20Þ

PFor the overall process to be self-sustainable, it is required that
the branching fraction of the NH2 + NO reaction, a = k65/(k65 + k66),
must be at least 25%. Early experiments [207,279] indicated a
smaller branching fraction, but it is now well established that a
attains values of 0.3-0.4 in the 1100(cid:1)1400 K range (Fig. 23).

PThe process is limited in the high temperature end by the chain
branching cycle occurring too rapidly, thus leading to a strong
growth in the O/H radical pool. This promotes conversion of NH2 to
NH,
NH2 þ OH @ NH þ H2O

ðR60Þ

which becomes competitive with the NH2 + NO reaction. The
þO2
NH formed is partly oxidized to NO through the sequence NH ⟶
HNO ⟶þM;OH;O2 NO. Also the NH2 + O reaction (R58, R59) contributes to
formation of NO. At sufficiently high temperatures, typically around
1400 K, these reactions lead to a net formation of NO.

PFig. 32 shows a sensitivity analysis for NO for the conditions of
the experiments of Duo (Fig. 30). Results for three water vapor con-
centrations are shown for temperatures slightly above the onset
temperature for the process and below the optimum temperature
for NO reduction. Chain branching processes enhance the reduction,
whereas termination processes inhibit it. Reaction R65, NH2 + NO
! NNH + OH, is favorable to NO reduction, and reaction R66, NH2 +
NO ! N2 + H2O, is equally unfavorable. Similarly, but with much
lower sensitivity coefficients, H + O2 ! O + OH promotes reaction
while H + O2 (+M) ! HO2 (+M) inhibits reduction of NO.

PThe sensitivity coefficients for the NH2 + NO reaction, and in par-
ticular for the branching fraction for the reaction, a = k65/(k65 + k66),
are very large, showing the unusually large sensitivity of modeling
predictions for Thermal DeNOx to this parameter. Apart from the H +
O2 reaction, no other steps in the mechanism are nearly as impor-
tant.

PFigs. 33 and 34 compare modeling predictions for NO with exper-
imental data from Kasuya et al. [280]. They performed a series of
flow reactor experiments where they investigated the effect of O2
concentration from close to zero to 50% on the Thermal DeNOx pro-
cess, measuring both NO, NO2, and N2O.

Fig. 32. Sensitivity coefficients for prediction of NO in Thermal DeNOx for the condi-
tions of the experiments of Duo [278] as a function of the water vapor concentration
at a temperature slightly above the temperature for onset of reaction: 0% (1100 K),
2.75% (1125 K), and 10% (1150 K).

Fig. 33. Comparison of experimental data [280] and modeling predictions for reduc-
tion of NO by NH3 in a quartz flow reactor: effect of O2 concentration. Symbols denote
experimental data, while solid lines denote modeling predictions. Inlet concentra-
tions: NH3 = 1000 § 60 ppm, NO = 500 § 30 ppm, H2O = 5%, balance N2. Residence
time (s) = 88.0/T(K). The reactor surface/volume ratio was 7.8 cm(cid:1)1.

PFig. 33 shows results for NO. An increase in the oxygen concen-
tration shifts the window towards lower temperatures and widens
it. At the same time, the maximum amount of NO removal decreases.
Similar results were reported by Lu and Lu [277]. These characteris-
tics are described well by the model. Similar to what was observed
by Klippenstein et al. [19], the predicted temperature for onset of
reaction is slightly shifted for some conditions. The very short NNH
lifetime of the present mechanism causes the predicted onset tem-
perature to be less sensitive to the O2 level than observed experi-
mentally, but
the difference is probably within experimental
uncertainty.

PFig. 34 compares predicted and observed concentrations of NO2
and N2O for the conditions of Fig. 33. Kasuya et al. were the first to
report detection of NO2 in the Thermal DeNOx process; NO2 is now
believed to be a key intermediate in the process [19,187,188]. Nitro-
gen dioxide is seen to form in significant quantities at high concen-
trations of O2, but the level drops off rapidly as O2 decreases.

PThe modeling predictions are in qualitative agreement with the
measurements, but the predicted window for NO2 extends to higher
temperatures than observed experimentally. Nitrogen dioxide is
formed through the sequence,

volume ratio was 4.4 cm(cid:1)1.

Pqualitatively with the measured profiles, but the model overpredicts
N2O under conditions where the NH + NO reaction is the main
source.

PPresence of combustibles such as H2 or CO shifts the window for
NO removal towards lower temperatures by replenishing the radical
pool. Furthermore, it leads to a narrowing of the process window,
because the enhanced radical levels cause oxidation of NH3 to NO to
compete more efficiently with the NO removal reactions. These
effects are illustrated in Fig. 35, which compares modeling predic-
tions for the effect of CO addition on Thermal DeNOx with the exper-
imental results of Alzueta et al. [281]. Both the shift in onset
temperature and the narrowing of the temperature window are cap-
tured quite well by the model.

PEven though the Thermal DeNOx mechanism is now well under-
stood and the main features of the process are predicted satisfacto-
rily by the model, quantitative modeling predictions over a wider
range of conditions are still elusive. As discussed in Section 3.6.1, the
rate constants and branching fractions of some of the key reactions
were re-evaluated in the present work, most importantly the NH2 +
NO reaction (R65, R66). This reaction is probably one of the best
characterized reactions in combustion chemistry, with rate con-
stants for the two product channels determined very accurately
from both experiment and theory. Still, this level of accuracy
( § 10%) is not sufficient to guarantee a good prediction of NO in the
Thermal DeNOx process. A small lowering of the branching fraction
from 0.37 (best theoretical value [191]) to 0.34 (lower end of experi-
mental range) at 1200 K considerably improves predictions for the
temperature for reaction by
process by increasing the onset
25(cid:1)50 K. It is probably a unique feature of nitrogen chemistry - due
to the selectivity in products (NO, N2, N2O, etc.) - that such a small
correction has a major impact on predictions. The accuracy of
modeling predictions for Thermal DeNOx is limited also by uncer-
tainties in other reactions, for instance at increased oxygen concen-
trations the steps HNO + O2 and H2NO + O2.

The competition between reactions of HNO and H2NO with O2 (nei-
ther of which are well characterized) and with the radical pool is
important for the peak concentration of NO2, as well as the width of
the NO2 formation window [19].

PThe formation of N2O is a complex function of temperature and
oxygen concentration. The N2O peak shifts from high temperature to
low temperature as [O2] increases. At 10% O2, a double peak in N2O
can be detected, indicating that two mechanisms of N2O formation
are active. The two sources of N2O are the reactions [187,188]

Pacid (HNCO), which at sufficiently high temperature initiates a reac-
tion sequence that can take out NO [152]. The process was discov-
ered by Perry [282] and termed RapReNOx. Compared to the
Thermal DeNOx process, RapReNOx is efficient at slightly higher tem-
peratures, due to the self-inhibiting nature of HNCO oxidation dis-
cussed in Section 3.5. A concern with the process is the formation
and possible emission of nitrous oxide, N2O.

PA number of flow reactor studies of the reduction of NO by HNCO
have been performed in order to investigate the characteristics of
this process [158(cid:1)160,181,283]. The most comprehensive data were
obtained by Caton and Siebers [158] who investigated the effect of
temperature and exhaust gas composition on the process. Modeling
studies for the RapReNOx process have been reported by Miller
and Bowman [1,152], Lyon and Cole [160], and Glarborg et al.
[159]. These studies have provided an overall understanding of
the reduction of NO by HNCO, but details of the chemistry
remain uncertain.

PThe subset used in the present work for studying the RapReNOx is
the same as that discussed in Sections 3.4 and 3.5 for oxidation of
HCN and HNCO, respectively. In the modeling, cyanuric acid is
assumed to decompose instantaneously at the temperatures rele-
vant for the process. The key reaction for removing NO is NCO + NO,
which has two product channels,
NCO þ NO @ N2O þ CO

ðR42Þ

NCO þ NO @ N2 þ CO2

ðR43Þ

The overall rate constant has been measured over a wide range of
temperature [161,284,285] and the main uncertainty relates to the
branching ratio for the reaction. We have adopted the recommenda-
tion of Baulch et al. [26], which is based on the theoretical work by
Zhu and Lin [153]. The nitrous oxide formed in reaction R42 may be
emitted from the process and it is a concern for RapReNOx.

PFor model validation, we compare predictions with the flow reac-
tor data of Caton and Siebers [158]. They systematically investigated
the effect of the initial concentrations of CO, H2O, and O2. Their data
are characterized by a high HNCO/NO ratio and long reaction times,
promoting NO reduction and widening the temperature window for
the process. However, uncertainties related to the mixing conditions,
the temperature profile, and the decomposition of cyanuric acid
imply that their results should be used with caution for model evalu-
ation purposes [152].

PFig. 36 shows the effect of adding water vapor and carbon mon-
oxide to the process. In the absence of H2O and CO, the process win-
dow occurs at temperatures above 1300 K. Under these conditions,
atomic oxygen is the main radical, and the HNCO + O reaction yields
both NCO (R47) and NH (R46). The subsequent NCO + NO reaction
(R42, R43) is chain terminating. Even though the reaction removes
NO, it serves to limit NO reduction, shifting the process to higher
temperatures. In addition, the sequence NO + O (+M) ! NO2 (+M),
NO2 + O ! NO + O2 is chain terminating and slows down reaction.
The NH radical is consumed primarily by reaction with O2 and NO in
chain propagating reactions; the NH + NO reaction makes a consid-
erable contribution to reducing NO under dry conditions.

PAddition of H2O shifts the window approximately 50 K towards
lower temperatures. The presence of water vapor causes a shift from
O to OH as the major chain carrier due to the reaction O + H2O !
OH + OH, diminishing the importance of the chain terminating
sequence involving NO2. Also, the direct reaction between HNCO
and H2O serves to promote reaction, even though it is slow.

PWhen CO is added as a combustible, the temperature window is
lowered further, with onset of reaction occurring below 1100 K.
Fig. 37 shows comparison of experimental data and modeling pre-
dictions for HNCO, NO, N2O, CO, and CO2 for these conditions. Due to
the large excess of HNCO compared to NO, as well as the long resi-
dence time, the temperature window for the process is unusually

Pwide, extending from 1100 K to beyond 1350 K. A significant fraction
of the NO is converted to N2O; only at the highest investigated tem-
perature of 1350 K is N2O depleted.

PDespite the uncertainties in the subset for HNCO, the model
describes the data of Caton and Siebers satisfactorily, particularly in
the presence of combustibles. Nitric oxide is generally overpredicted
in the higher end of the temperature window, but N2O is predicted
well. However, the availability of reliable experimental data for Rap-
ReNOx is limited and it is difficult to fully assess the predictive capa-
bilities of the model.

P4.1.3. SNCR with urea (NOxout)

PSelective non-catalytic reduction of NO using urea as a reducing
agent was proposed by Muzio and coworkers [286] who termed the
process NOxOut. At high temperatures, urea decomposes rapidly to
NH3 and HNCO [158], and thus the chemistry of the process shares
important similarities with both Thermal DeNOx and RapReNOx.
Compared to ammonia, the use of urea has the advantage of easier
handling and reduced safety hazards. In addition, the urea SNCR pro-
cess has a slightly wider temperature window than SNCR with NH3.
A disadvantage of the process is that, similarly to RapReNOx, N2O
will be formed and may be emitted from the process.

PThe urea SNCR process is not as well characterized as Thermal
DeNOx, even though its commercial impact is similar. Experimental
data for NOxOut, obtained under well-defined conditions in the labo-
ratory, are limited, partly because urea is typically added to the reac-
tor either in solid form or dissolved in water. In laboratory scale,
flow reactor experiments have been reported by Alzueta et al. [287]
and Lee et al. [288], while Rota et al. [289,290] conducted experi-
ments in a jet-stirred reactor.

PChemical kinetic models for the NOxOut process have been
reported by several groups [287,289,291]. The reaction mechanism
involves reactions for urea decomposition, along with the H/N/O
subset for Thermal DeNOx and the HNCO subset for RapReNOx. Data
for urea decomposition at high temperatures and high heating rates
representative of the SNCR process are limited, but results indicate
that it is fast [291,292]; we assume it to happen instantaneously.
When urea is added in an aqueous solution or as a solid, the decom-
position presumably happens in condensed phase; reported activa-
tion energies of 15(cid:1)20 kcal mol(cid:1)1 [292] seem to be too low to be
compatible with a gas-phase dissociation. Details of the condensed
phase decomposition of urea still need to be verified, but a prelimi-
nary reaction mechanism has been proposed based on TGA experi-
ments [293].

PFig. 38 compares modeling predictions to the experimental data
from Alzueta et al. [287], obtained in a laminar flow reactor, and
from Rota et al. [289], measured in a jet-stirred reactor. Despite dif-
ferences in reactor configuration and urea/NO molar ratio, the two
data sets agree fairly well. The onset of reaction (in the absence of
combustibles) occurs at around 1150 K, with the highest NO reduc-
tion observed at about 1250 K.

PThe model captures the trends well and the agreement with
experiment is satisfactory. The minimum in NO is predicted at
slightly higher temperatures than observed and the level of reduc-
tion is overpredicted at higher temperatures, but the differences are
not large.

PSimilar to the situation for RapReNOx, the availability of experi-
mental data for NOxOut is limited and the predictive capability of
the model is difficult to assess. However, conceivably the uncertainty
in predictions is similar to that for Thermal DeNOx, since this subset,
in particular the choice of rate constants for the NH2 + NO reaction
and NNH dissociation, controls the temperature window for the pro-
cess.

4.2. Reburning

PSixty years ago Myerson et al. [294] discovered that hydrocarbon
radicals react fast with NO. A low-NOx-technique that exploits this
reaction was outlined by Wendt et al. [295], who termed the method
reburning. In reburning NO is removed from the combustion prod-
ucts by using fuel as reducing agent. By adding part of the fuel and
combustion air to the post flame region instead of the main combus-
tion zone a three stage combustion process is obtained. The first
stage, where around 80% of the heat is released, is normally run with
stoichiometric or excess air. The reburn fuel, which usually consti-
tutes 10(cid:1)20% of the total fuel, is added after the primary combustion
zone to form a fuel-rich second stage where NO is reduced.

reduction of NO by urea. Symbols denote experimental data, while solid lines denote
modeling predictions. Upper figure (laminar flow quartz reactor (S/V = 2.3) [287]):

dence time (s) = 200/T(K).

PDownstream of the reburn zone secondary combustion air is added
to secure complete burnout.

jet-stirred reactors [100,268,270,272],
and low-pressure flames [299(cid:1)303]. The stages in the reburn pro-
cess involve mixing of the reburn fuel into the flue gas from the pri-
mary zone, decomposition of the reburn fuel and formation of flame
radicals to react with NO, and conversion of the formed cyano and
amine species to molecular nitrogen. The reburn chemistry is quite
complex, sharing similarities with both prompt NO and fuel(cid:1)NO
chemistry. Despite this complexity, reported modeling studies for
reburning [1,21,23,24,262,266,268(cid:1)273] have generally provided
satisfactory results, at least for smaller hydrocarbons.

P4.2.1. Reaction subset for reburning

PTable 10 lists selected reactions from the reburning subset of the
model. Significant progress has been made in characterizing the
reactions that reduce NO. In the 1200(cid:1)1500 K range typical of the
reburn process it is primarily the reactions HCCO + NO, CH3 + NO
and 3CH2 + NO that are active in reducing NO [21,23]. At higher tem-
peratures, for instance in well-stirred reactors or flames, NO is pri-
marily reduced by smaller hydrocarbon radicals, i.e., 3CH2, CH, and C
[1]. Many of these steps are complex, multi-step reactions.

PThe reaction between CH3 and NO has three product channels:

CH3 þ NO @ HCN þ H2O

ðR74Þ

CH3 þ NO @ H2CN þ OH

ðR75Þ
PIt has been studied extensively, both at low temperatures, where
only the recombination reaction is competitive, and at high

Ptemperatures, where cyanides are formed (R74,R75). In the tempera-
ture range of the present work, the CH3NO complex dissociates rap-
idly, and only reactions R74 and R75 serve to remove NO. The
overall rate for these two steps is fairly well established. We use a
rate constant for the overall reaction derived theoretically by Miller
et al. [304], which is in good agreement with high temperature
experimental data [319,320], together with a branching fraction of
50% [21].

PThe reaction between 3CH2 and NO has two major product chan-

nels, presumably

3CH2 þ NO @ HCNO þ H

ðR76Þ

ðR77Þ
3CH2 þ NO @ HCN þ OH
Despite a number of experimental studies [305,321(cid:1)323] both reac-
tion rate and product channels for this reaction remain uncertain. In
particular, the static reactor laser photolysis measurements of Ata-
kan et al. [305] deviate significantly from the shock tube results of
Bauerle et al. [323] at the overlapping temperature of 1000 K, both
in the overall rate constant and in the contribution of an OH produc-
ing channel. Following Mendiara and Glarborg [23], we adopt the
overall rate constant from Atakan et al., using the branching fraction
reported by Fikri et al. [306]. The reaction of singlet CH2 with NO
yields primarily inter-system crossing to triplet CH2, with a possible
minor channel forming HCN [21]. For the reaction of CH with NO
that appears to have five product channels (R80(cid:1)R84), we rely on
the recommendations of Baulch et al. [26].
PThe reaction between ketenyl and NO,

HCCO þ NO @ HCNO þ CO

HCCO þ NO @ HCN þ CO2

ðR91Þ

ðR92Þ

has been characterized experimentally in a number of studies
[312(cid:1)314,324(cid:1)328] and both the overall rate constant and the
branching fraction is fairly well established. Measurements of the
branching fraction indicate that the HCNO + CO channel (R91) domi-
nates, with reported yields of 64(cid:1)88% [313,314,326,327]. We have
combined the total rate coefficient measurement of Carl et al. [312]

Pwith the reported branching fraction, which appears to be indepen-
dent of temperature [313,314], to arrive at the rate coefficients used
in the present work.

PThe reactions between hydrocarbon radicals and NO mostly feed
into the cyanide pool, forming mainly hydrogen cyanide; the cyanide
chemistry is discussed in Section 3.4. However, both HCCO + NO
(R76) and 3CH2 + NO (R91) form HCNO and the fate of this interme-
diate is important for the NO reduction efficiency. In earlier reburn
modeling work [21], it was assumed that the reactions of HCNO
with O and OH were fast and that both of them produced NO as the
major product. Later, Miller et al. [316] proposed NCO as an alterna-
tive product for the HCNO + OH reaction. However, recent experi-
mental [318] and theoretical [329] work indicate that the HCNO +
OH reaction forms mainly H2NO (R97) and HNO (R98). Thereby the
reactions of HCNO with O (R95) and OH (R97, R98) largely recycle
HCNO back to NO, and consequently the reactions that form HCNO
have only a minor impact on the NO reduction efficiency.

P4.2.2. Modeling reburning

PEven though the reburning process has been studied extensively,
experimental data obtained under well-controlled conditions in lab-
oratory scale are limited. For the present purposes, we have selected
data from well(cid:1)stirred reactor and flow reactor experiments.

PChen and Malte [330] studied combustion of CH4/O2/N2-mixtures
doped with NO in a jet-stirred flow reactor. They measured the
emissions of NO, HCN and NH3 as a function of fuel-air equivalence
ratio and temperature. Fig. 39 shows comparison between their
measurements and modeling predictions for reactor temperatures
of 1580 K and 1800 K.

PThe behavior of the reburning system is similar at the two inves-
tigated temperatures. Under lean conditions 60(cid:1)100% of the NO is
emitted, while under fuel-rich conditions the emission of NO is con-
siderably lower, constituting less than 20% of the inlet NO at fuel(cid:1)air
equivalence ratios larger than 1.4. Here, a major part of the NO is
converted to cyanides, with minor amounts of ammonia formed.
There is a minimum in total fixed nitrogen (TFN), taken here as the
sum HCN + NH3 + NO, as a function of the equivalence ratio. The

Pminimum at 1580 K occurs at a fuel(cid:1)air equivalence ratio below 1.2,
while at 1800 K the minimum is observed at more reducing condi-
tions, f (cid:5) 1.3. The agreement between experimental data and
modeling predictions is good. Both NO, HCN and NH3 are predicted
well over the whole range of equivalence ratios, in particular at the
higher temperature.

PThe importance of competing reaction pathways depends
strongly on the actual reburn conditions, particularly reburn fuel,
temperature, and stoichiometry. However, the results can all be
interpreted in terms of three most important overall steps:

P(cid:4) Decomposition of the reburn fuel and formation of hydrocarbon

radicals

P(cid:4) Fast reaction of hydrocarbon radicals with NO, forming cyanide

species

P(cid:4) Comparatively slow conversion of cyanide species via isocyanic

and amine species partly to N2 and partly back to NO

PFig. 40 shows a reaction path diagram for the reburn chemistry,
for methane as a reburn fuel. Nitric oxides are converted into cya-
nides and isocyanides by reactions with a wide range of hydrocarbon
radicals, mainly CH3, 3CH2, CH, C, and HCCO. At high radical concen-
trations (high temperatures and/or jet-stirred reactor conditions),
the smaller hydrocarbon radicals are most active in reducing NO,
while in a less reactive environment (lower temperatures and/or
flow reactor conditions) reactions of NO with CH3 and HCCO
dominate.

PThe cyanide pool is oxidized in a sequence of reactions similar to
that discussed for prompt-NO formation (Section 3.2) and HCN oxi-
dation (Section 3.4). Under high-temperature, reducing conditions a
significant fraction of the HCN is converted through the isomer HNC
in the sequence HCN ⟶þM;H HNC ⟶OH HNCO ⟶H NH2 ⟶H;OH NH. This
sequence is shown as a single dashed line in Fig. 40.

PReactions of 3CH2 and HCCO with NO yield HCNO, which becomes
an important nitrogen intermediate under certain conditions. The
HCNO is partly converted to HCN by reaction with atomic hydrogen
and possibly also by thermal dissociation. However, a significant
fraction of the HCNO is recycled directly or indirectly (via HNO and
H2NO) to NO through reaction with OH (R97, R98) and O (R95); these
recycling pathways are shown in Fig. 40 as a single dashed line.

Fig. 41. Sensitivity coefficients for prediction of NO under the conditions of the Chen
and Malte reburn experiments [330] at 1580 K as a function of the stoichiometry (f =
1.1 or 1.3).

PFig. 41 shows sensitivity coefficients for NO for the conditions of
the Chen and Malte experiments for fuel-air equivalence ratios of
1.1 and 1.3. The analysis shows that the reactions of importance for
NO removal depends on the stoichiometry, but there are some com-
mon trends. Nitric oxide is consumed by mainly hydrocarbon radi-
cals and prediction of NO is sensitive to these steps, in particular CH3
+ NO (R74, R75), 3CH2 + NO (R76), and CH + NO (R82). Consequently,
also reactions promoting formation of CHn exhibit negative sensitiv-
ity coefficients; these steps include CH3 + H (R99, R100b), CH3 + OH
(R103) and 3CH2 + H (R106). Oxidation of hydrocarbon radicals to
oxygenated intermediates inhibits NO removal; this takes place
mainly through the reactions CH3 + O (R101), 3CH2 + OH (R107), CH
+ H2O (R115), and CH + CO2 (R116). Nitric oxide may also be reduced
by reaction with amine radicals, NH + NO (R17) and N + NO (R1), or
reformed by the reaction N + OH (R3).

P1150 ppm NO. The figure shows the effect of oxygen concentration
on the emission of total fixed nitrogen (NO + HCN + NH3) from the
reactor. Myerson observed significant temperature gradients in the
reactor and the reported temperature of 1423 K was only accurate
within § 70 K.

PMyerson showed that for a variety of fuels, there was a most
effective molar ratio between the oxygen and the reburn fuel at
which a minimum TFN could be obtained. The observed minimum
for methane occurs at an O2/CH4-ratio of 1.0 (Fig. 42). The agreement
between experimental data and calculations is good, except at very
reducing conditions (O2/CH4 < 1.0) where the concentration of total
fixed nitrogen is overpredicted. Both modeling predictions and
experimental data indicate that the fixed nitrogen under these con-
ditions consists almost entirely of NO and HCN; only negligible
amounts of NH3 are formed.

PAlzueta and coworkers [21,267] studied the reburn chemistry for
different hydrocarbon fuels in flow reactor experiments under
reducing conditions. In Fig. 43 a comparison is shown between their
data and calculations for NO in combustion of methane and C2-
hydrocarbons as a function of temperature.

PThe results show that the ability to remove NO varies signifi-
cantly between the investigated hydrocarbons. Under the conditions
of the experiments, CH4 is only active above 1350 K, reducing NO by
about 30%. A simulated natural gas (methane with about 10% of eth-
ane) is more efficient in reducing NO and with a lower onset temper-
ature, about 1300 K. Among the C2-hydrocarbons, acetylene and
ethylene behave similarly, with an NO reduction of up to about 50%
from 1150 K. Ethane is able to reduce NO above 1100 K, with the effi-
ciency increasing with temperature. Nitric oxide is partly converted
to hydrogen cyanide for all fuels, but the HCN concentrations are
comparatively low.

PThe modeling predictions capture the trends well and are mostly
in good agreement with the experimental results. The only major
discrepancy is seen for reburning with ethane, where both the
reduction of NO and the formation of HCN is underpredicted. Part of
this difference may be attributed to mixing effects in the reactor, as
discussed by Glarborg et al. [21].

PPrediction of the potential of reburning for reducing NO relies on
the ability of the model to describe the chemistry in the reducing
zone, where hydrocarbon radicals are formed and act to reduce NO,
and at the rich-lean transition, where the formed cyanides and
amines are converted to NO and N2. The accuracy in predicting the
fuel-derived radical concentrations is still in discussion, even for oxi-
dation of methane (see Section 3.2 and Appendix B). However, since
most of the C1 and C2 radicals typically participate in removing NO
and the radical + NO reactions generally are fairly well characterized,
the model would be expected to predict the NO consumption in the
reducing zone perhaps within 30% for methane, with a slightly
higher uncertainty for other hydrocarbons. The burnout chemistry
at the rich-lean transition, which is discussed in more detail by Kris-
tensen et al. [182], involves oxidation of HCN and NH3 in the pres-
ence of the remaining combustibles as well as of NO. It shares
similarities with selective non-catalytic reduction of NO (see Sec-
tion 4.1). The radical generation in the burnout region is controlled
by oxidation of CO and H2 rather than by the nitrogen chemistry,
and the selectivity for forming NO and N2 from the reactive nitrogen
species would be expected to be captured well by the model.

Concluding remarks

PClose to thirty years ago, Miller and Bowman published their
epochal review on nitrogen chemistry in combustion. They con-
cluded that future changes to their proposed mechanism were likely
to be quantitative rather than qualitative. Since then, our knowledge
of the thermochemistry and rate constants important for formation
and destruction of nitrogen oxides has increased considerably,

Pfacilitated by the development of high-level theoretical tools. How-
ever, to a large extent the statement of Miller and Bowman has
turned out to be accurate. The subsets describing formation of NO by
the thermal mechanism, via N2O, or from oxidation of cyanides and
amines are now more reliable due to advances in our knowledge of
specific reactions, but qualitatively they are similar to those pro-
posed by Miller and Bowman. The same applies for the reburn type
chemistry that serves to destroy NO in staged combustion. Major
discoveries post Miller and Bowman concern the formation of
prompt NO, where the products of the rate controlling reaction
between CH and N2 is now known to be NCN + H rather than HCN +
N, and the Thermal DeNOx process, where the predicted lifetime of
(cid:1)9 s, so reaction now is
NNH has been reduced from 10
restrained by the branching fraction a of the NH2 + NO reaction
rather than by reaction of NNH with NO or O2. Despite the advances
in the accuracy of specific rate constants, there are still subsets of
the nitrogen chemistry where modeling predictions are less reliable

Pthan desired; these include primarily prompt NO formation and
selective non-catalytic reduction of NO (SNCR). However, overall the
present non-optimized model offers reliable predictions for forma-
tion and destruction of NO over a wide range of conditions and can
be used with a significant degree of confidence in engineering calcu-
lations for industrial processes.

PFuture challenges in nitrogen chemistry include extension of the
model to more complicated fuels (emphasizing, for instance, forma-
tion of hydrocarbon radicals that may interact with nitrogen spe-
cies), more complex nitrogen compounds such as cyclic species, and,
not least, extension to the high pressures encountered in engines
and gas turbines.

Appendix A. Surface reactions in quartz reactors

PA significant fraction of the experimental data on nitrogen chem-
istry in combustion is obtained in atmospheric pressure, laminar
flow quartz reactors. While these data benefit from well-character-
ized experimental conditions, the potential impact of surface reac-
tions on the reactor walls introduces an uncertainty in data
interpretation. Heterogeneous reactions may involve decomposition
of fuel components, promoting reaction, or loss of radicals, inhibiting
reaction.

PSome nitrogen species, in particular ammonia [186,331,332], are
known to decompose on quartz surfaces. Dean et al. [254] observed
that heterogeneous effects affected induction times for oxidation of
ammonia. For Thermal DeNOx, Lyon and Benn [257] found little
impact of surfaces, consistent with the modeling study of Glarborg
et al. [186] who concluded that surface decomposition of NH3 was
not important for SNCR in low S/V quartz reactors. However, Suhl-
mann and Rotzoll [333] reported that for high surface/volume ratios,
presence of quartz surfaces widened the temperature window for
the process.

PRadical recombination on SiO2 surfaces (quartz, Pyrex, etc.) has
been studied extensively, due to its importance for reaction in reac-
tors (e.g., explosion limits [334]) and on heat shields for space
vehicles in earth reentry [335]. The radical recombination at the sur-
face is usually described in terms of an apparent recombination effi-
ciency g. Data are available for H [336], O [335(cid:1)340], OH
[215,341(cid:1)343], HO2 [215,342,344(cid:1)346] and N [337].

PIt can be expected that the impact of the surface will depend on
the concentration of water vapor in the system. In flow reactor
experiments, the dominating radicals are O (dry conditions) or OH
(moist conditions), provided the mixture is not too fuel-rich. In addi-
tion to controlling the main chain carrier, the presence of water
vapor has been reported to alter the surface condition, for instance
inhibiting oxidation of CO on a quartz surface [347].

PIn a dry system, where the silica surface may be more active,
atomic oxygen is the dominating chain carrier under oxidizing con-
ditions. The recombination probability for O on quartz is found to be
a complex function of temperature [336], but in the 700(cid:1)1430 K
range results are consistent, indicating an activation energy for the

Papparent recombination efficiency of 4.2 kcal mol(cid:1)1 [335,336]. At
these temperatures, it is likely that both Eley(cid:1)Rideal and Lang-
muir(cid:1)Hinshelwood recombination mechanisms contribute to the
radical loss [340,348,349].

PIt is of interest whether a radical loss mechanism can explain the
difference between measured and predicted temperatures for the
onset of reaction in SNCR experiments conducted under dry condi-
tions (see Section 4.1.1 and Fig. 30). Fig. 44 compares experimental
results for the NH3/NO/O2 system obtained under dry conditions
[278] with modeling predictions with and without heterogeneous
removal of O. The sink of atomic oxygen on the quartz surface is rep-
resented in the mechanism by a pseudo-first-order reaction with an
activation energy set to the value reported by Kim and Boudart
[336] and the A-factor adjusted to predict the observed onset of
reaction for the conditions of Fig. 44. Addition of this pseudo-reac-
tion to the mechanism shifts the predicted window for the process
towards higher temperature, providing a good agreement between
modeling and experiments. However, results in literature on the
impact of surface reactions on ammonia oxidation and Thermal
DeNOx in dry systems indicate that heterogeneous radical loss is
insignificant. Lyon and Benn [257] reported that reaction rates for
the NH3/O2/NO system was reproducible within 6% when varying
the surface to volume ratio by a factor of two in a dry system. Fur-
thermore, Dean et al. [254] varied the S/V ratio from 4 cm(cid:1)1 to
20 cm(cid:1)1 without observing significant changes in the post-induction
time NH3 oxidation rate.

PLoss of radicals on the surfaces of quartz flow reactors in moist
systems was discussed by Kristensen and coworkers [350,351].
Fig. 45 shows their results for moist CO oxidation in quartz reactors
of varying size. The moist CO oxidation experiments had good repro-
ducibility, independent of time and among reactors of varying size.
The results indicate that under moist conditions loss of radicals on
the quartz surface of aged reactors is negligible. Modeling predic-
tions conducted with loss of O atoms on the surface with the rate
constant derived above (assuming it to be proportional to the sur-
face/volume ratio of the reactor) shows an impact of reactor size not
observed experimentally.

PBased on this evidence, we conclude that surface loss of radicals
in quartz reactors is generally insignificant at temperatures relevant

Appendix B. Formation and consumption of hydrocarbon
radicals

PTable 11 lists important reactions in the CHn subset (n = 0(cid:1)3).
Formation of methylene in its triplet (3CH2) and singlet (1CH2) states
from methyl occurs mainly by reactions involving H and OH. In the
present mechanism, the rate constant for CH3 + H to form 3CH2 + H2
(R99) is drawn from Klippenstein (unpublished work), while the
channel to 1CH2 + H2 (R100b), represented by the reverse step, was
adopted from the evaluation of Baulch et al. [26]. The rate constants
for the CH3 + OH reactions (R103, R104) were based on the theoreti-
cal work of Jasper et al. [352]. The calculated rate constant k103 for
abstraction on the triplet surface is in good agreement with the mea-
surement of Wilson and Balint-Kurti [353]. Singlet CH2 formed in
(R100b) and (R104) is mostly converted to its triplet state by the
rapid collisionally induced inter-system crossing (R105).

PThe CH radical is formed from methylene by the reactions CH2 +
H ! CH + H2 (R106) and CH2 + OH ! CH + H2O (R108). The rate
constants for both of these steps have been in question. Low temper-
ature data for reaction R106 [361(cid:1)365] are in good agreement,
indicating a fast
reaction with a rate constant of around
1014 mol cm(cid:1)3 s(cid:1)1. However, the extrapolation to high temperatures
is uncertain. Early high-temperature data from shock tubes [366]
and flames [367] indicated that the reaction is not faster than
1013 mol cm(cid:1)3 s(cid:1)1 at 2000 K, while more recent shock tube work of
Rohrig et al. [358] and Deppe and Wagner [368] suggested a fast rate
even at high temperature.

PMeasurements [369(cid:1)372] of the rate constant of the reverse
reaction, CH + H2 ! CH2 + H (R106b), support the findings of Rohrig
et al. and Deppe and Wagner that the CH2 + H rate constant is largely
independent of temperature. Fig. 46 compares the available data for
k106, both from direct measurements of the forward reaction and
from converting data for k106b through the equilibrium constant.
Values of k106 derived from reaction R106b are generally larger, per-
haps due to interference from the competing step CH + H2 (+M) ⟶
CH3 (+M). In the present work we have applied a rate constant of
1.6 ¢ 1014 cm3 mol(cid:1)1 s(cid:1)1; slightly faster than the recommendation of

Pto combustion. However, surface decomposition or oxidation of
reactive species could conceivably play a role, and data from flow
reactor or batch reactor experiments on systems that react slowly
(such as HNCO oxidation) or are sensitive to initiation (e.g, NH3 oxi-
dation) must be interpreted with caution.

PBaulch et al. [26]. However, there is significant scatter in the data
and an accurate determination of k106 over a wide temperature
range is desirable.

PFor the reaction of CH2 with OH (R107, R108) we rely on the theo-
retical work of Jasper et al. [357]. Reactions R106 and R108 that form
CH compete with steps involving O, OH, and O2 that form oxygen-
ated species and serve to diminish the CHn radical pool.

[374], but conflicts with measurements at room temperature
[375,376]. Reaction R111 competes with other consumption steps of
CH, including reactions with O, OH, O2, and H2O. Even though they
are much slower than the radical(cid:1)radical reactions, reactions of CH
with H2O and CO2 may become important under conditions with
high concentrations of combustion products. The reaction between
CH and H2O yields formaldehyde,

PFig. 47 shows an Arrhenius plot for the reaction. Previous model-
ing studies have relied on the measurements of Zabarnick et al.
[377] (298(cid:1)669 K) and Blitz et al. [378] (291(cid:1)673 K), which show a
negative temperature dependence of reaction R115, making it com-
paratively slow under most combustion conditions. Recently, Klip-
penstein (unpublished work) studied the reaction at a high level of
theory. He calculated a rate constant with a minimum at approxi-
mately 800 K and a slow increase with temperature above this value.
His rate constant, which was adopted in the present model, results in
a reaction which is more competitive at combustion temperatures
and consequently a faster predicted consumption of CH.

PThe rate constant for the reaction between CH and CO2 (R14) has
been measured over a wider temperature range (298(cid:1)3500 K)

were drawn from the following sources: Bosnali and Perner [379], Zabarnick et al.

(unpublished).

P[382(cid:1)385]. The data, which show a strong curvature in the Arrhe-
nius expression, are well described by the rate constant proposed by
Glarborg and Bentzen [359].

PHydrocarbon radical concentrations reported from low-pressure,
premixed methane flames include data for methyl [303,386,387],
triplet methylene [386], and singlet methylene [388(cid:1)394]. Most
data are available for methylidyne (CH), which has been detected in
methane flames [62,70,95,97,303,395(cid:1)405], as well as in flames of
C2H2 [62,97,406], C2H4 [35], C2H6 [70,405], C3H6 [66], and C3H8
[70,396,405,407].

PFig. 11 shown in Section 3.2.3 compared the measured and calcu-
lated CH-profiles from two sets of low-pressure methane flames,
obtained over a range of fuel(cid:1)air equivalence ratios. Modeling pre-
dictions were generally in satisfactory agreement with measure-
ments, capturing the CH concentration within a factor of two under
all conditions. Here we compare modeling predictions with mea-
sured profiles for a wider range of CHn radicals, obtained by molecu-
lar beam sampling and mass spectrometry.

PIn Fig. 48, modeling predictions are compared to data from Hen-
nessy et al. [386] for a low-pressure, premixed methane/oxygen/
argon flame. The structure of this flame is well predicted by the
model; all major species (including CH4 shown) are captured pre-
cisely. The peak concentrations of CH3 and 3CH2 are predicted within
a factor of two, but the methylene peak is shifted by about 1.5 mm
compared to the measured profile.

PFig. 49 compares measured and predicted profiles of 3CH2 , CH,
and C for the low-pressure, premixed ethylene/O2/N2 flame from
Blauwens et al. [35]. The flame was operated under near-stoichio-
metric conditions. While CH is calculated quite accurately, the model
overpredicts the 3CH2 and C concentrations by factors of two and
three, respectively.

PThe uncertainties in the measured radical concentrations in the
flames of Hennesy et al. and Blauwens et al. were reported to be fac-
tors of three and two, respectively. Lamoureux et al. [72] and Berg
et al. [95] measured CH concentrations by laser diagnostics with an
estimated accuracy of 20% (see Section 3.2.3). We estimate that
modeling predictions of the CHn radical concentrations in combus-
tion of small hydrocarbons are mostly accurate within a factor of
two.

Fig. 48. Comparison of measured [386] and predicted mole fractions of CH4, CH3, and
3CH2 for a low-pressure premixed methane/air flame. The symbols denote experi-
mental data, while the solid lines denote calculated values. Conditions: pressure of
20 torr, inlet composition 19% CH4, 38% O2; balance Ar. The maximum flame tempera-
ture was about 2300 K and the velocity of the unburnt gas mixture was 119 cm/s.

PFor larger hydrocarbons, formation and consumption of fuel-
derived radicals are more complicated. Sutton et al. [70] compared
modeling predictions to flame measurements for different fuels and
stoichiometries and concluded that the tested mechanisms were not
able to predict the CH concentration accurately over a wider range
of fuels and conditions. Also, for more complex fuels larger hydrocar-
bon radicals, such as propargyl (C3H3), may become important in
interacting with the nitrogen chemistry. More work is desirable in
this area, but it is outside the scope of the present review.

Fig. 49. Comparison of measured [35] and predicted mole fractions of 3CH2, CH, C, and
NO for a low-pressure premixed ethylene/air flame. The symbols denote experimental
data, while the solid lines denote calculated values. Conditions: pressure of 18.5 torr,
fuel(cid:1)air equivalence ratio of f = 0.97 (11.2% C2H4 in O2/N2 mixture) and a velocity of
the unburnt gas mixture of 169 cm/s.
