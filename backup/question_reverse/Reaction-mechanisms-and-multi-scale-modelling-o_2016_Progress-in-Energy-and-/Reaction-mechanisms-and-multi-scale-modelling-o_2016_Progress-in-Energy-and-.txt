Contents

In this work about pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass, the individual reaction mechanisms of cellulose,
hemicellulose and lignin are initially described. The recent advances in the understanding of the fun-
damental reaction pathways are described, including quantum-mechanical calculations, and the description
of pyrolysis as a two-step process, i.e., primary pyrolysis and secondary charring, the effect of the pres-
ence of an intermediate liquid compound, and the influence of inorganic species are discussed.

The need to describe biomass pyrolysis as the sum of the contributions of its individual components
is then emphasised. The process of determining biomass mass loss kinetics is analysed, and the product
composition and heat of reaction that are experimentally obtained during pyrolysis are presented, along
with detailed schemes that can be used to predict them.

Finally, it is demonstrated that a multi-scale consideration of pyrolysis on multiple levels – specifi-
cally, on molecular, particle and reaction levels – is required to accurately describe biomass pyrolysis.
Intra-particle phenomena and particle models are discussed and the reactor level is analysed with a focus
placed on fixed bed and fluidised bed pyrolysis. In summary, a list of 10 research focal points that will
be important in the future is presented.

1. Introduction

The energetic and chemical utilisation of biomass has become
a prominent topic during recent years, and it is expected to play a
more important role in the future due to its benefits. Biomass is a
renewable energy source, is available worldwide, allows the pro-
duction of heat and power on demand, and, if its collection is
performed in a sustainable way, is CO2-neutral. The main types of
biomass are [1,2]:

• wood and woody biomass;
• herbaceous and agricultural biomass;
• aquatic biomass;
• animal and human biomass wastes.

Biomass conversion can occur through either biochemical,
physico-chemical or thermochemical processes [3,4]. During bio-
chemical conversion, molecules of biomass are broken down into
smaller molecules by bacteria or enzymes. This process is much
slower than thermochemical conversion, but does not require an
input of much external energy. The principal routes for biochem-
ical conversion are digestion (anaerobic and aerobic) and
fermentation. During aerobic digestion, or composting, different types
of microorganisms that have access to oxygen from the air produce
carbon dioxide, heat, and a solid digestate. In anaerobic digestion,
the main products are methane and carbon dioxide in addition to
a solid residue. During fermentation, part of the biomass is con-
verted into sugars by acid or enzymes. The sugar is then converted
into ethanol or other chemicals with the help of yeasts. During
physico-chemical processes, vegetable oil is generated from some
types of biomass like seeds from sunflower or rape seeds by press-
ing. During thermo-chemical processes, biomass is converted at high
temperatures. The main thermo-chemical processes are pyrolysis,
combustion, gasification, hydrothermal liquefaction and hydrother-
mal carbonisation [5–8].

• Pyrolysis: thermal degradation of carbonaceous material in the
absence of an externally supplied oxidising agent, usually at

temperatures in the range of 300–600 °C. The products of py-
rolysis are char (solid), permanent gases and a pyrolytic liquid
(liquid at room temperature), which is often referred to as bio-
oil or pyrolysis-oil. Char can be employed as a domestic cooking
fuel, for barbecuing or other energy purposes, upgraded to ac-
tivated carbon, or used in the metallurgical industry, as well as
many other applications [9]. When the obtained char, also called
in this application biochar, is redirected to the soil, the proper-
ties of the former are highly improved over the mid- and long-
terms, also representing a strong CO2 sink [10–13]. The obtained
bio-oil can be upgraded to liquid fuel for combustion engines
(e.g., transportation) [14,15], or directly employed for power or
heat generation. Catalytic hydrotreating, with the addition of hy-
drogen [16], and catalytic cracking [17] of the bio-oil can be
conducted for the upgrading, which is required in order to reduce
the oxygen content of the liquid fuel. Moreover, catalytic pyrol-
ysis profoundly alters the pyrolytic product distribution. Therefore,
catalysts such as zeolites are also commonly employed in the
pyrolysis process to directly produce pyrolyis liquids with a
reduced oxygen content [15]. Bio-oil is also a promising source
for chemicals in a biorefinery concept [18,19] and for biologi-
cal pesticides [20]. Pyrolysis gases can be also used for heat and
power generation.

• Gasification: thermal degradation of carbonaceous material in
the presence of an externally supplied oxidising agent (air, pure
oxygen or steam). The main product of gasification is a mixture
of gases (producer gas), the main components of which are CO,
CO2, H2, H2O, CH4, N2 (just when air is used as oxidising agent),
tar and small particles of ash or char. The producer gas can be
used as fuel gas in internal combustion engines for power and
heat production. It could also be used to fuel gas turbines or fuel
cells. Liquid fuels can also be obtained from the producer gas
through methanol or Fischer–Tropsch synthesis [5,21–23].
• Combustion: complete oxidation of the biomass feedstock. In con-
trast to pyrolysis and gasification, which represent fuel conversion
processes, combustion can provide heat. The hot gases are used
for direct heating purposes, for power generation producing steam
by means of subsequent steam turbine processes, and as an

energy source for a Stirling engine or an organic Rankine cycle
for power production in small scale applications [24,25].

• Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL): direct conversion of biomass
in the liquid phase at low temperatures (250–400 °C) and high
pressures (up to 200 bar), usually with a high hydrogen partial
pressure and catalysts to enhance the reaction rate and/or to
improve the selectivity of the process. The main goal is to reach
maximum liquid yields with higher quality than those ob-
tained from a pyrolysis process, in terms of their higher heating
value and lower oxygen content [7].

• Hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC): conversion of biomass
suspended in water under saturated pressure at moderate tem-
peratures (180–250 °C) for several hours. The main goal is to reach
maximum solid yields, obtaining a lignite-like product [8].

Biomass and waste account for around 10% of the world primary
energy consumption. Almost 60% of total biomass used world-
wide in 2010, however, was employed in a traditional way, mainly
for cooking and space heating in developing countries as India and
sub-Saharan Africa [26]. Materials such as firewood, crop resi-
dues, manure, or charcoal (produced from the previously mentioned
sources) used in a traditional way have been the main energy source
over most of human history [27] and still plays relevant roles today.
These processes, however, have very low efficiencies and lead to
severe health and environmental problems. This biomass utilisa-
tion cannot actually be described as renewable [28].

Most of the commercial activity in biomass conversion in a
modern way has been applied to low moisture content biomasses,
i.e., agricultural, herbaceous and woody biomass [1]. The main com-
mercial application of biomass today is in industry, where the pulp
and paper industry is the largest user, followed by the power and
building sectors. Transportation is the fourth most relevant sector
and has grown rapidly in recent years [26,29]. The most common-
ly employed technology is combustion. Systems for heat and power
production are available over a broad range of sizes, from a few kilo-
watts up to more than 100 MW. This is a consolidated technology,
although it should still improve regarding the emissions of partic-
ulate matter (PM) and NOx [24]. Other thermo-chemical technologies
for production of heat, power and chemicals – gasification and py-
rolysis – are very promising because they offer higher efficiencies
than combustion [5] and plentiful applications, as previously de-
scribed. They have a growing importance, but have not yet been fully
consolidated into the market [5,22,23,30].

The biofuels sector recently experienced a rapid growth, and fer-
mentation of biomass used to produce first generation biofuels is
fully commercialised. However, severe criticism recently has been
made by members of scientific and policy communities about first
generation biofuels, defined as those conventionally produced from
food crops (i.e., bioethanol from starchy crops via fermentation and
biodiesel from vegetable oils via transesterification of triglycer-
ides). It was stated that they were little better than traditional fossil
fuels in terms of their overall carbon footprint and environmental
damage, and were possibly much worse due to their potential effects
on biodiversity, land-use, food availability and prices, as well as
related socio-economic implications [31]. Therefore, their use was
limited in the recent proposal on Indirect Land Use Change from
the European Commission [32].

The utilisation of lignocellulosic biomass, in contrast to food crops,
for different uses, including heat and power applications, produc-
tion of chemicals, or second generation biofuels, significantly
improves first generation biofuels in terms of their greenhouse gas
emission savings, carbon footprint and environmental damage (e.g.,
deforestation) [31]. Therefore, utilisation of lignocellulosic biomass
is becoming more common every year. Ligno-cellulosic biomass is
plant biomass that is mainly composed of cellulose, hemi-cellulose,
and lignin; wood and agricultural residues are primary examples.

Biochemical conversion of lignocellulosic biomass is an expen-
sive and difficult process because it requires a hydrolytic pre-
treatment (acid, enzymatic, or hydrothermal) to separate lignin,
hemi-cellulose and cellulose. Once these ingredients have been sepa-
rated, the cellulose fraction can be fermented into alcohols. The
lignin, which is mainly not converted, is either subjected to com-
bustion or thermo-chemical conversion into chemicals. Extensive
research is being conducted in order to overcome the natural
resistance of plant cell walls to microbial and enzymatic decon-
struction, which is the responsible for the high cost of biochemical
conversion [33,34]. Recent advances have been achieved in the en-
gineering of new metabolic routes for production of biofuels [35,36].
Thermo-chemical processes such as combustion, gasification and
pyrolysis are currently better geared towards the conversion of lig-
nocellulosic biomass. Hydrothermal processes (HTL, HTC) are more
suited to biomass materials which are intrinsically high-moisture
materials, such as aquatic biomass and animal and human biomass
[1].

This review focuses on pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass. Py-
rolysis itself is a promising conversion process that can be used to
produce liquid bio-oil and biochar, and which is a main sub-
process in other thermo-chemical processes such as gasification or
combustion. It is extremely important to fully understand this key
process in order to further develop the thermo-chemical conver-
sion of biomass. This work is focused on the fundamentals of biomass
pyrolysis. A complete review of biomass pyrolysis was presented
by Di Blasi in 2007 (online) [37]. The objective of this work is to
complement this previous work by describing recent advances and
focusing on topics that were not previously thoroughly treated, such
as reaction schemes, product composition, or the importance of sec-
ondary reactions.

In the next section, biomass components and pyrolysis prod-
ucts will be presented. In Section 3, the pyrolysis mechanisms of
biomass macromolecules will be described in detail. After individ-
ually analysing the mechanisms of biomass components, kinetic
schemes and the composition of products of lignocellulosic biomass
pyrolysis will be reviewed in Section 4. Multi-scale modelling of
biomass pyrolysis, including the molecular, particle and reactor level,
will be then discussed in Section 5. Finally, the overarching con-
clusions will be drawn.

2. Biomass composition and pyrolysis products

2.1. Biomass components

Lignocellulosic biomass is mainly composed of macromolecu-
lar substances – cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin – together with
smaller amounts of low molecular weight substances: extractives
and inorganics (salts or minerals). Extractives are organic com-
pounds and inorganics are the species that form the ashes. Biomass
has a porous structure and consists of cells. In a typical lignified cell,
cellulose represents an important structural element that is sur-
rounded by other substances that function as matrix (hemicellulose)
and encrusting (lignin) materials [6].

Moisture is also present in biomass and can be found in three

forms [6]:

• Bound or hygroscopic water: found in the cell wall, mainly
hydrogen bonded to the hydroxyl groups of cellulose and hemi-
cellulose and, to a lesser extent, of lignin. It is limited by the
number of sorption sites available and the number of mol-
ecules of water that can be held on a sorption site.

• Free or capillary water: found in liquid form in the lumens or
void areas of biomass, when sorption sites are no more avail-
able. It is only held by weak capillary forces without hydrogen
bonds.

44

• Water vapour: found in the gas phase.

The proportion of the macromolecular components varies among
different biomass species, as reviewed by Vassilev et al. [38]. The
cellulose content in wood generally ranges from 40 to 44%. Hemi-
cellulose represents usually between 25 and 30% of the total wood.
The percentage is on average higher in hardwoods (angiosperms,
flowering plants) than in softwoods (gymnosperms, seed-producing,
non-flowering plants) and the hemicellulose composition is very
different. The usual proportions of lignin in wood are 18–25% for
hardwood and 25–35% for softwood. The ash content in wood is
usually below 1%. However, the previous compositions only apply
to the plant stem. Barks, twigs and leaves have more hemi-cellulose
and lower cellulose content, more extractives and inorganic species.
In herbaceous and agricultural biomass, cellulose is usually the most
abundant and lignin is the least abundant macromolecule, but there
are many exceptions, such as the high lignin content in some shells
[38,39]. The content of inorganic species in herbaceous and agri-
cultural biomass is, on average, higher than in wood. The precise
values of the cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin contents for several
species, covering a wide range of biomass, can be found in Refs. 38
and 40.

The cellulose component is a polysaccharide consisting of linear
combination of d-glucose units connected to each other by β(1→4)
glucosidic bonds, as seen in Fig. 1a. This polymer has a very high
degree of polymerisation (DP, number of units), which can be higher
than 10,000. Cellulose has a strong tendency to form intra and in-
termolecular hydrogen bonds, and the aggregation of the linear
chains of molecules within microfibriles creates a highly crystal-
line structure [6,39,41]. Many crystalline structures of cellulose are

known, with different locations of hydrogen bonds between and
within the strands [42].

Hemicellulose is a complex polysaccharide mainly composed of
pentose sugars (xylose and arabinose) and hexose sugars (mannose,
galactose, glucose, rhamnose or glucuronic acid) (see Fig. 1c). In con-
trast to cellulose, the hemicelluloses are amorphous and have a lower
DP, usually between 50 and 200 [6]. Hemicellulose in hardwoods
consists mainly of acetylglucuronoxylan (15–30%, formed mainly
by xylose and galactose) in association with other components such
as galactose, arabinose, rhamnose, glucuronic acid and acetyl groups.
Softwoods consist mainly of galactoglucomannan (5–8%, formed by
mannose, glucose and galactose) and glucomannan (10–15%, formed
by mannose and glucose). Low amounts of glucomannan are also
present (3–5%) in hardwoods. Arabinoglucuronoxylan is also present
in softwoods (around 7–8%, formed by xylose, galactose and arabi-
nose) [41,43–45]. Xlyan (see Fig. 1b) is a good representative of
hemicellulose from hardwoods, and glucomannan of hemicellu-
lose from softwoods [39]. Xylose is the most abundant
monosaccharide in xylan, but the amounts depend on the biomass
species [46]. As it can be derived from the composition, hemicel-
lulose in hardwood is mainly composed of pentoses, while hexoses
are more abundant in softwood.

The total polysaccharide fraction (holocellulose) is mainly com-
posed of cellulose and hemicellulose. Other polysaccharides present
in lignocellulosic biomass are pectins. Pectin is a polymer of units
of galacturonic acid (hexose) with dispersed units of rhamnose, ga-
lactose or arabinose [41,47].

Lignin is a randomly linked, amorphous, high-molecular-
weight phenolic compound. The main building blocks in lignin are
p-coumaryl, coniferyl and sinapyl alcohol units (see Fig. 2). Softwood

lignin is mostly composed of units of coniferyl alcohol (with one
methoxy group) with low amounts of units of p-coumaryl alcohol.
Hardwood lignin, in addition to this, contains sinapyl alcohol units
(with two methoxy groups). Lignin is more abundant and polymer-
ic in softwoods than in hardwoods. Lignin is inevitably chemically
altered during its isolation. Therefore, the properties of lignins differ,
depending on the extraction or isolation techniques used [6,14,48].
The extractives are substances that can be separated by succes-
sive treatments of the biomass with solvents and that can be
recovered by evaporation of the solvents. They contribute to char-
acteristic properties such as colour, odour, taste and decay resistance
of the wood. The extractives are classified according to their lipo-
philic and hydrophilic constituents [49,50]. Liphopilic extractive
compounds, usually called resins, are soluble in liquids of low po-
larity such as hexane and are mainly lipids with a low oxygen
content. They can be non-cyclic compounds such as fats, fatty acids
and waxes, or cyclic compounds such as terpenoids (including resin
acid) and sterols. Hydrophilic extractive compounds are mainly phe-
nolic compounds, such as lignans, but can also be sugars. There are
generally more extractives from softwood than from hardwood. In
spruce (softwood), there are around 2 wt% extractives in the heart-
wood and sapwood. The proportion, especially of hydrophilic
extractives, is higher in bark and knots (>10 wt%).

Inorganic elements are present in biomass, but usually in lower
concentrations as compared to organic elements. In a decreasing
order of abundance in mass, the major elements found are com-
monly C, O, H, N, Ca, K, Si, Mg, Al, S, Fe, P, Cl, Na, Mn and Ti [2].
Cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin are formed of C, O and H, and
N is organically bonded to them. The other elements are present
in water-soluble, ion-exchangeable (salts or organically bound com-
pounds) or mineral forms [51]. The term inorganics, which refers
to elements present in minor concentrations such as K, is actually
not strictly correct, as a fraction is organically bonded. The chem-
ical composition of different biomass types can be found in Refs.
2, 38, and 52, including the composition of the ashes that can be
produced through biomass combustion. Ashes are formed of inor-
ganic matter as phosphates, carbonates, silicates, chlorides, sulphates,
oxyhydroxides, nitrates or hydroxides. Therefore, inorganics are ash-
forming elements.

2.2. Pyrolysis products

The reaction products of pyrolysis are a complex mixture of

volatiles and a solid residue, called char.

2.2.1. Char

The solid residue of pyrolysis is a carbonaceous and porous
product called char. The composition of char depends mainly on the
final pyrolysis temperature and initial biomass material. The char
carbon content increases at higher pyrolysis temperatures. On
average, the oxygen and hydrogen mass contents are 10.0 and 1.5%,
respectively, at 700 °C in an dry ash-free basis [53]. The ash content
of char depends mainly on the initial inorganic biomass composi-
tion. Typical ash compositions have been previously described
[2,38,52].

During pyrolysis, an increase in aromaticity and a reduction of
oxygen-containing functional groups occur [54]. The energy density
increases and the material becomes hydrophobic [55]. The inter-
nal surface area of the solid material increases significantly, especially
at temperatures higher than 400 °C. The maximum surface area of
char from woody biomass is usually observed at pyrolysis tem-
peratures in the range of 600–800 °C [56]. A very high range of char
surface areas have been reported in the literature. This is probably
due to the differences in raw materials and pyrolysis process pa-
rameters [57]. Values over 300 m2/g are usually achieved for the
maximum surface area of woody biomass [56]. At low heating rates,

the internal structure of char is not abruptly modified from the one
of the original biomass during pyrolysis, where the natural poros-
ity allows the release of the volatiles and no major morphological
changes occur. However, at high heating rates, the original cellu-
lar structure is lost due to the fact that it completely melts [58–60].
For temperatures higher than 800 °C, the surface area is reduced
due to an increase in the structural order [61,62]. Under these tem-
perature conditions, the structure of the char changes from
amorphous to graphite-like, leading to a reduction in atomic pore
space between the carbon layers [63,64]. A complete ordered struc-
ture is, however, not achieved, because lignocellulosic char is a “non-
graphitising” carbon [64].

Inorganic elements and nitrgen are also present in char. Inor-
ganic elements such as Ca, Si, Mg, Al, Fe or Ti are almost completely
retained due to their non-volatile nature. Other elements such as
N, K, Na, Cl or S can be partially or totally released during pyroly-
sis. For example, over 90% of the alkali metals are found in water-
soluble or ion-exchangeable forms and are available for release
[51,65], but their release is usually much lower [66].

2.2.2. Volatiles

Volatile compounds that are produced in biomass pyrolysis
include permanent gases and compounds which are liquids at
ambient temperature. Reviews of the characterisation of pyrolysis
liquids (bio-oil) have been published by Oasmaa and Meier [67] and
Mohan et al. [14]. Depending on the chemical structure and func-
tional groups, the organic volatiles can be classified in the following
groups (see also Table 1 and Fig. 3) [14,67–71]:

• Permanent gases: the main permanent gases are CO, CO2, CH4
and H2. Light hydrocarbons such as ethene and propene and ni-
trogenous compounds (HCN, NH3 or HNCO) are also produced
in lower quantities. They are products of all the biomass mac-
romolecules: cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin.

• Water vapour: reactive water produced in pyrolysis, not to be
confused with water released during drying. It is produced from
cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin.

• Carbonyls and alcohols: a carbonyl group is carbon atom double-
bonded to an oxygen atom, such as is found in aldehyde, ketone
and carboxylic acid moieties. An alcohol group is a hydroxyl func-
tional group (—OH) bounded to a carbon atom. These non-
cyclic compounds are produced from all components: cellulose,
hemicellulose and lignin.

• Heterocyclics: cyclic compounds that have at least two differ-
ent elemental atoms as members of its ring. They are mainly
produced by cellulose and also by hemicellulose. The heteroa-
tom is commonly oxygen. Heterocyclic compounds with nitrogen
and even sulphur atoms are also present. The most common com-
pounds are furans.

• Sugars: carbohydrate compounds that are produced from py-
rolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose. Examples are levoglucosan
and cellobiosan, produced from cellulose, or xylose, produced
from hemicellulose.

• Phenolics: aromatic compounds that contain a phenyl group (e.g.,
guaicols, syringols, cresols, catechols or phenols). They mainly
originate from lignin.

• BTX and PAH: aromatics with a single ring (BTX: benzene, toluene,
xylene) or several rings (PAH: polyaromatic hydrocarbons such
as naphthalene, anthracene or pyrene) but, as opposed to phe-
nolics, without oxygen content. They are secondary products that
are mainly produced from phenolics, but can be also generated
in lower concentrations from holocellulose volatiles.

The species in each group usually have properties in the same
range. For example, the previous groups can be listed from higher
to lower boiling point as follows: phenolics, BTX/PAH, sugars > het-
erocyclics > carbonyls and alcohols, water vapour > permanent gases.
Compounds that make up what is commonly referred as tar,
i.e., organic compounds that are liquid at ambient temperature,
have been classified by Evans and Milne [68–70] in primary, sec-
ondary and tertiary tars, depending on the temperature zones in
which they can be present. Primary tar includes oxygenated com-
pounds, which are the result of depolymerisation of the biomass
macromolecules: cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. It is com-
posed of carbonyls and alcohols, heterocyclics, sugars and phenolic
compounds. Heterocyclics and sugars are produced from
holocellulose (cellulose and hemicellulose); phenolics, from lignin;
and carbonyls and alcohols, from all components. The group of
phenolic compounds is especially complex. Primary tar formed by
lignin (phenolics) contains mainly guaiacol and (in hardwood)
syringol units, i.e., the aromatic structure that exists in the origi-
nal lignin is still present, but is fragmented. These phenolic molecules
do not only consist of single ring units, like guaiacol, illustrated in
Fig. 3. Phenolic tars also consist of oligomers (di-, tri- and tetram-
ers are the most abundant) of these single ring units. This volatile
polymeric fraction, which is water insoluble, is called pyrolytic
lignin [72,73]. Possible structures of the pyrolytic tar of lignin
have been proposed by Bayerbach and Meier [74]. An example is
shown in Fig. 4.

Tars produced during primary pyrolysis can be converted by
several secondary tar cracking reactions when the temperature in-
creases, producing in the first place secondary tar and, with further
secondary reactions, tertiary tar: Primary tar → secondary tar (phe-
nolics) → tertiary tar (BTX/PAH). The nature of the tar is changed
during these secondary reactions and the total tar yield is reduced,
as permanent gases are also produced. Cracking of primary tars gen-
erated in the particle pores, which produces secondary/tertiary tars,
can occur either homogeneously in the gas phase (i.e., in the pores
or outside the particles) [75] or heterogeneously on the char surface,
i.e., the pore walls [76]. Secondary tars are, needless to say, all in-

biomass.

and Meier [74] with permission of Elsevier).

termediates between primary and tertiary tars (BTX and PAH). During
secondary reactions, the reduction of the tar yield from phenolics
is lower than the reduction of tar yield from carbonyls and alco-
hols, sugars and heterocyclics. Therefore, primary tars from
holocellulose do not usually form secondary/tertiary tars; they mainly
produce permanent gases when they crack. Secondary tars mainly
consist of phenolics such as phenols, cresols or catechols, which are
produced from the primary phenolics generated from lignin pyrol-
ysis. Tertiary tars, which are aromatic rings without oxygen, are
mainly produced from secondary phenolics, although they can be
also generated from holocellulose via different routes, but in smaller
quantities. Tertiary tars are produced in low quantities at typical
pyrolysis temperatures (<500 °C) and their production is en-
hanced at high temperatures. They have a high relevance because
they lead to technical difficulties in gasification [70] and are pre-
cursors of soot [77].

A complete characterisation of volatiles produced during biomass
pyrolysis is challenging. Different techniques need to be applied in
order to characterise all compounds. Most commonly, volatiles are
condensed and carbonyls and alcohols, heterocyclic, BTX/PAH and
single ring phenolic compounds are analysed afterwards using gas
chromatography (GC). Levoglucosan (LGA), the main sugar, can also
be analysed using GC, while other sugars can be analysed using high-
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The amount of water
in the liquid phase can be measured by Karl–Fischer titration [67,78].
The most challenging compounds to determine are the phenolic
oligomers, called pyrolytic lignin. Phase separation of this fraction
can be achieved with water addition [72,79]. Several characterisa-
tion techniques can be employed [72,73,80,81], but individual
compounds cannot be currently identified. Another difficulty is the
instability of the phenolic fraction in the condensed phase [82].

Online techniques have been applied to measure the volatiles,
studying the transient evolution of the process. Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) has been applied to measure perma-
nent gases and some carbonyls and alcohols online [83] and GC has
been used to analyse permanent gases. Other innovative tech-
niques have been applied, such as tunable synchrotron vacuum
ultraviolet photoionisation mass spectrometry, with the focus on
measuring phenolics [84], and laser induced fluorescence (LIF)
[85–88] or ultraviolet adsorption [89], with the focus on measur-
ing PAH.

3. Pyrolysis mechanisms of biomass components

The pyrolysis reaction mechanisms of the biomass macromo-
lecular components, i.e., cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, will be
reviewed in detail in this section.

3.1.1. Classical schemes

The first thorough insights into cellulose pyrolysis were re-
viewed by Shafizadeh [39]. They are summarised in the Broido–
Shafizadeh scheme, depicted in Fig. 5a. This scheme was originally
developed by Kilker and Broido [90] and later on simplified by
Shafizadeh and Bradbury [91]. Active cellulose is firstly produced
in reaction R1 by depolymerisation of cellulose, reducing the degree
of the polymerisation but without releasing any volatiles. Active cel-
lulose, with a low degree of polymerisation, can be decomposed by
two competitive reactions: a slow reaction that produces char plus
permanent gases (reaction R2), and the main reaction that pro-
duces a tarry pyrolyzate containing levoglucosan (LGA) and other
sugars (reaction R3). Reaction R2 dominates over reaction R3 at tem-
peratures above 300 °C.

According to these references [39,91], glucose decomposition
products can form after primary pyrolysis through secondary de-
hydration reactions from the products of R3. This produces furans,
pyrans or other sugars. The dehydration products are also re-
ported to be important as intermediate compounds in secondary
char formation through secondary reactions. Fragmentation of the
sugar units, accompanied by other reactions such as dehydration,
provides a variety of carbonyl and alkene compounds as well as
water, CO, CO2 and char. It has also been reported that the prod-
ucts of these fragmentation reactions are closely similar to those
obtained from pyrolysis of pure LGA. The yields of the different prod-
ucts of pyrolysis of cellulose are greatly affected by the pyrolysis
conditions. Yields of LGA are higher under vacuum and greatly
reduced by increasing pressure. Moreover, the presence of cata-
lysts significantly increases the production of fragmentation and
dehydration products, reducing the LGA yield. Furthermore, reac-
tion R2 has a lower activation energy than reaction R3, so charring
is favoured at low temperatures.

However, later studies [92,93] suggested the direct formation of
ring scission products (fragmentation products), such as
hydroxyacetaldehyde (HAA). Low molecular weight compounds
(LMWC), mainly carbonyls, are not formed from secondary reac-
tions of LGA or other sugars but directly from active cellulose. In
the new proposed scheme by Piskorz et al. [92], shown in Fig. 5b,
the initial stage involves a competition between low temperature

char formation (R4) and a rapid reduction in the degree of
polymerisation of cellulose to produce active cellulose (R1).
Once the degree of polymerisation has been sufficiently reduced,
competition exists between ring fragmentation to produce
hydroxyacetaldehyde, among other products (R2), and depoly-
merisation by transglycosylation to yield mainly LGA and other
sugars (R3).

Banyasz et al. [94,95] later completed the Piskorz scheme, in-
cluding other products such as permanent gases and char, as seen
in Fig. 5c. The low temperature charring reaction R4 is retained, in-
termediate products are generated in reaction R2 and liquid LGA
is produced in reaction R3. The intermediates of reaction R2 de-
compose rapidly to produce formaldehyde and CO in competition
with the production of hydroxyacetaldehyde. The liquid LGA from
reaction R3 is expected to then evaporate and can afterwards
undergo charring reactions to produce CO2 as well as char. It is in-
teresting to note that production of CO and CO2 arises from two
different pathways. Moreover, activation energies for reactions R2
and R3 have been calculated. The ring fragmentation pathway (R2)
has the higher activation energy, so it is favoured at high tempera-
tures over transglycosylation (R3) [94].

Temperature exercises only a weak influence over the produc-
tivity of the two pathways (fragmentation and transglycosylation),
however, as compared to the presence of inorganics, which act as
catalysts. Essig et al. [96] observed that the addition of 0.05% NaCl
to ash-free cellulose reduced the yield of LGA by a factor of 6 and
increased the hydroxyacetaldehyde yield by a factor of more than
40. Later on, Richards and Zheng [97] showed that the presence of
K, Li, and Ca ions strongly promoted the formation of char from wood
at the expense of tar (mainly LGA) formation. Many works have re-
ported that the presence of minor amounts of the inorganic
impurities reduced the LGA yield greatly [98].

Secondary vapour–solid phase interactions play a key role in char
formation. It was stated in the review of Antal and Varhegyi [99]
that the decomposition of pyrolytic vapours may be the only source
of char from samples of pure cellulose. Therefore, char is not a
primary product but a secondary product, produced in reaction R7
of the Banyasz scheme (Fig. 5c). The only exception could be the slow
char formation from reaction R4. However, this process was not
thought to be relevant at temperatures over 300 °C. Mass transfer
during weight loss plays a main role in char formation, as

described by Milosavljevic and Suuberg [100,101]. They demon-
strated that, after LGA vapourises, it undergoes charring if it cannot
diffuse out of the sample matrix. Consequently, anything that hinders
mass transport increases charring. Therefore, the residence time of
tar in a char-forming environment is key to determining the char
yield [101].

Moreover, secondary charring reactions (R7 in Fig. 5c) are asso-
ciated with the production of H2O, CO2 [102] and, more recently,
with the formation of volatile PAH [103,104]. A study with LIF has
shown the linked production of CO2 and PAH in charring of cellu-
lose [88]. The complex pathways of charring are not fully understood,
but furans are probable intermediates [105,106]. Possible mecha-
nisms leading to aromatics from volatiles of cellulose in the gas phase
have been investigated [107].

Primary tars, such as sugars, furans or carbonyls produced in
primary pyrolysis can be cracked at high temperatures. These re-
actions, which produce mainly permanent gases, can occur
homogeneously in the gas phase at temperatures higher than 500 °C
[68,75] producing mainly CO or heterogeneously, when in contact
with char, which acts as catalyst [76].

3.1.2. Controversies of classical schemes

Most of the fundamentals of the schemes from Piskorz and
Banyasz are still valid, and are often referred in literature. Contro-
versies about some details of the scheme, such as the activation
energies for the production of tar and gas, the importance of sec-
ondary reactions, the role of active cellulose and the optimal way
to determine kinetics, will be subsequently addressed.

3.1.2.1. Activation energy of lumped products. Competitive schemes,
such as the previously described ones, are usually employed in lit-
erature to predict the product composition of cellulose pyrolysis.
The reaction products are lumped in three categories: char, tar and
gas. However, confusion exists about the different activation ener-
gies reported for tar and gas formation, as explained by Mamleev
et al. [108].

• In the work of Bradbury et al. [109], following the Broido–
Shafizadeh scheme (Fig. 5a), a low activation energy was assigned
to reaction R2, which produces char and gas, while tar forma-
tion (reaction R3) had a higher activation energy.

• In the work of Banyasz et al. [95], following the Banyasz scheme
(Fig. 5c), tar is produced together with char and CO2 through re-
action R3 in competition with reaction R2, where mainly LMWC
are generated, including gases. The later reaction (R2) has a higher
activation energy, i.e., it is favoured at higher temperatures. The
activation energy of char formation at low temperatures through
reaction R4 was not calculated by Banyasz et al. [95], because
it was considered a very slow process.

Therefore, tar formation has a higher activation energy than gas
formation in Bradbury et al. [109], in contrast to Banyasz et al. [95].
The reason for these contradictory results is that different phenom-
ena are being described. In the work of Bradbury et al. [109], the
lower activation energy of char plus gas formation indicates that
charring is favoured at low temperatures, while more liquids are
formed at higher temperatures. On the other hand, in the later
work of Banyasz et al. [95] the higher activation energy of the re-
action producing LMWC (including gases) indicates that the
fragmentation pathway is favoured at higher temperatures over
transglycosylation. In the scheme of Banyasz, the results of Bradbury
et al. [109] are included in the competition between reactions R1
and R4. However, these activation energies were not calculated in
that work. If we consider that the kinetics of these reactions are the
ones calculated by Bradbury et al. [109], the product composition
in mass percentage at different heating rates predicted by the scheme

et al. [109] for R1 and R4 and of Banyasz et al. [95] for R2 and R3 (A1 = 3.2·1014 s−1,
E1 = 198 kJ/mol, A2 = 1.0·1014 s−1, E2 = 195.9 kJ/mol, A3 = 4.0·1010 s−1, E3 = 151.1 kJ/
mol, A4 = 1.3·1010 s−1, E4 = 153.2 kJ/mol).

of Banyasz (Fig. 5c) is as shown in Fig. 6. The mass loss over time
(dm/dt) of active cellulose (AC), LMWC, LGA and charring products
are calculated as shown in Eqs. (1), (2), (3) and (4), respectively. The
simulations are carried out at constant heating rates, assuming a
constant temperature in the particle, i.e., a pure kinetic regime. The
employed pre-exponential factors (Ai) and activation energies (Ei)
are stated in the legend of Fig. 6. Optimal conditions for LGA and
liquid production are in the range of medium temperatures/
heating rates. At lower temperatures, charring is favoured, while at
higher temperatures, more light condensable species and perma-
nent gases are formed through fragmentation reactions.

3.1.2.2. Secondary charring reactions and competitive schemes. The
importance of secondary charring reactions, despite having been
long known, is usually overlooked in literature. It should be again
pointed out that char is mainly (or exclusively) a secondary product
[99]. Secondary charring reactions can be produced at the same place
as primary pyrolysis or when the volatiles leave the particle. Py-
rolysis without char formation of small samples of wood at high
heating rates has been reported by rapidly removing the volatiles
from the wood surface [110]. The char yield in cellulose pyrolysis
depends on:

• Heating rate: high heating rates are required to obtain a low char

yield, as generally accepted [30] and depicted in Fig. 6.

• Final temperature: under vacuum, Shafizadeh [39] reported a final
solid yield of 8% at 350 °C and 4% at 450 °C, for cellulose powder.
• Retention time of the volatiles: when the retention time of
the volatiles in the solid matrix is increased, secondary reac-
tions are promoted increasing the char yield [101]. The
experiments of Antal and Varhegyi [99] highlight its importance.
Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) were performed in an open

sample holder with 1 mg of cellulose at 10 K/min to produce a
final char yield of 5%. When experiments were done with the
addition of a cover (with a small pinhole) to the sample pan, the
char yield increased to 19%. Similar results were presented by
Mok and Antal [111]. The same effect was produced when a
higher initial sample mass was employed in the experiments
[112].

• Pressure: at lower pressures, fewer secondary reactions take place,
reducing the char yield. Shafizadeh [39] reported a char yield
of 34.2% at 300 °C and ambient pressure, but the char yield was
reduced to 17.8% at 1.5 mmHg of pressure. The same trend has
been reported by Mok and Antal for experiments at higher pres-
sures [111].

• Presence of inorganics: ash constituents, especially potassium,
sodium and calcium, act as catalysts for the decomposition
process and favour charring reactions, increasing the char yield
[37].

• Atmosphere: Kashiwagi and Nambu reported a lower char yield
for oxidative pyrolysis (21%) than for pyrolysis in a N2 atmo-
sphere (24%) at low heating rates (1–5 K/min) for pyrolysis of
small samples (5 mg) of cellulosic paper [113].

In the previously presented schemes, where the reaction rates
are calculated using Arrhenius equations, the char yield is a func-
tion of the temperature program, i.e., the heating rate and final
temperature. The presence of secondary reactions is only partially
included in these schemes, because the effects of retention time of
the volatiles, pressure and presence of inorganics are not consid-
ered, despite being even more important for the determination of
the product composition than the temperature program. As an
example, the yield of char plus gases produced in the charring re-
action is 21.3% at 10 K/min, following the scheme of Banyasz (Fig. 6).
This leads to a char yield of around 10%, assuming that most of the
carbon in cellulose is converted to char in this reaction. As shown
in the previously reported experiments of Antal and Varhegyi [99],
the char yield can be much higher or lower than 10% depending
on the extent of charring reactions, ranging from 5 to 19%. Extreme
caution should be taken when applying these kinetics to experi-
mental conditions that are far removed from the ones from which
they were derived. However, this is not always the case.

3.1.2.3. Active cellulose. The role and importance of active cellu-
lose has been widely discussed in literature. The formation of an
intermediate liquid compound (ILC) was demonstrated at very high
heating rates by Lede et al. [114]. This ILC can be associated with
active cellulose. The ILC decomposes rapidly into volatile products
in a competition between transglycosylation and ring fragmenta-
tion. The ILC also plays a main role in aerosol generation by reactive
boiling ejection of pyrolysis products from molten cellulose [115,116].
A review on this topic was written by Lede [117]. However, the exact
nature of active cellulose is still unknown. Active cellulose was re-
cently associated with the formation of reducing end groups in the
(long) cellulose macromolecule, which are supposed to activate crys-
talline cellulose [118]. The reducing end of a polysaccharide is the
monosaccharide residue with hemiacetal functionality, while the
non-reducing end is the monosaccharide residue in acetal form.

Despite the presence of several reactions in the previously de-
scribed schemes, the rate of mass loss of small samples of pure
cellulose in TGA experiments (at low and medium heating rates)
can be determined through a single first order reaction with high
activation energy (around 200 kJ/mol). This rate limiting step was
associated with the depolymerisation step [99,119]. It was dem-
onstrated that, for these heating rates, a complex scheme including
active cellulose does not give better predictions [120], and neither
was an ILC compound detected. As it will be discussed in detail in
Section 3.1.3, ILC is probably also produced at these heating rates,

but it is decomposed rapidly. Because it does not accumulate, it is
not detected and it is not required to include it in a kinetic scheme
describing these experiments.

3.1.2.4. Determination of kinetics. Different values for the activa-
tion energy of cellulose pyrolysis have been reported in literature,
as reviewed by Lin et al. [121]. But, as previously stated, the true
activation energies obtained from TGA experiments are high (around
200 kJ/mol) [99,119]. Low activation energies can be obtained due
to the difficulties in obtaining a pure kinetic regime during these
experiments. High heating rates or high initial masses can lead to
thermal lag, resulting in a low apparent activation energy. A round
robin study from Gronli et al. [122] has clearly pointed this out. The
conditions required to obtain a pure kinetic regime will be dis-
cussed in Section 5.1.1.

Another recurrent topic in literature is the question of whether
kinetics obtained at low heating rates/temperatures can be applied
at high heating rates/temperatures. In theory, different reaction
mechanisms can be active at different temperatures. However, it must
be pointed out that, in this respect, it is impossible to achieve high
temperatures without going through the low-temperature region
[37]. With a true heating rate of 1000 K/s (difficult to achieve), cel-
lulose cannot be heated above 527 °C without incurring a 60%
decomposition of the substrate. Moreover, an estimation of high tem-
perature kinetics is extremely difficult to conduct due to the reasons
pointed out in the previous paragraph and further discussed in
Section 5.1.1. Kinetics obtained at high temperatures usually have
lower activation energies, but this has been attributed to the pres-
ence of heat and mass transfer limitations [37]. Extrapolating low
temperature kinetics to describe high temperature experiments
seems to be a better option than to derive high temperature kinet-
ics [99].

3.1.3. Mamleev phenomenological model

A phenomenological pyrolysis scheme developed by Mamleev
et al. leads with some of the previous controversial items [123].
Moreover, this model does not only describe the chemical reac-
tions taking place during pyrolysis, but it also includes a detailed
description of the transformation processes inside the cellulose
matrix, which should be considered in order to correctly model cel-
lulose pyrolysis. A partial summary of the scheme is shown in Fig. 7.
In this two-phase scheme transglycosylation leads to the forma-
tion of cavities in the cellulose matrix, which are filled up by liquid
tar with a high boiling point (mainly LGA) that plays the role of an
electrolyte. A disrupted macromolecule contains a moiety with an
LGA-end and a moiety with a non-reducing chain end (NR-end).
Chain ends located at the interface between polymer cellulose and
tar migrate into the tar. Only two reactions determine the migra-
tion of the chain ends. These are transglycosylation and
fragmentation. The formation of an ILC is, therefore, not included
in the kinetic scheme. Decomposition of LGA-ends produces LGA
and other sugars through transglycosylation (R3). Decomposition
of NR-ends produces several intermediate ring cleavage products
and light gases through fragmentation reactions in the liquid phase
(R2). It is postulated that LGA-ends are more stable than NR-ends,
which would explain why the LGA yield can considerably exceed
50% in this competition. Moreover, the transglycosylation does not
need a catalyst, while a catalyst is needed in the other pathway (R2).
Volatile acids that evolve during decomposition and dissolve in the
tar catalyse various heterolytic reactions (represented as catalytic
continuous initiation from products of R3 and feedback from prod-
ucts of R2 in Fig. 7). Also, the presence of alkali and alkaline earth
metallic (AAEM) species (Na, K, Mg, Ca) in biomass are important
for acid catalysis.

The activation energies of transglycosylation and fragmenta-
tion are in this scheme 190–200 and 250 kJ/mol, respectively. Mass

loss experiments in thermo-gravimetric studies can be described
with one reaction because, at low heating rates, both competing re-
actions nearly merge in one reaction (the difference in peak
temperatures at typical heating rates in TGA is lower than 10 °C).
Moreover, differences in reactivity of different cellulose samples can
be accounted for through a proper conversion function, consider-
ing an incubation period.

The ILC is formed at all heating rates. It is even formed at slow
heating rates, typical of thermo-gravimetric conditions, where it is
not detected because the accumulation is not significant. Its inter-
mediate products degrade into final products without a considerable
time delay. Therefore, the rate of mass loss of cellulose is com-
pletely limited by the rate of depolymerisation in the two reactions
R2 and R3.

Char is produced from secondary reactions in the condensed
phase. It is assumed that it is mainly formed via the fragmenta-
tion pathway. The reduction in char yield at high heating rates can
be explained by the competition between char (R4) and LMWC (R5)
formation. Char formation through cross-linking and dehydration
(R4) inside the liquid tar has lower activation energy, and is fa-
voured at low heating rates/temperatures. This reaction can also be
catalysed. Char formation at very low temperatures is included in
the LGA pathway, but it is assumed that this pathway is less rele-
vant. Moreover, other reactions such as tar cracking are possible in
the condensed phase at low temperatures (T < 500 °C) but not outside
this phase because they would stop. Higher temperatures (T > 500 °C)
are needed to initiate radical tar cracking reactions in the gas phase.

3.1.4. Quantum-mechanical calculations

Even though a broad knowledge has been acquired about cel-
lulose pyrolysis, the exact mechanism is still unknown [124]. In
recent years, several papers including quantum–mechanical cal-
culations have been published, which have brought more insights.
The advantage of these works of fundamental chemistry is that
lumped models are avoided and the elementary reactions, which
remain poorly understood, are analysed. In lumped models the ap-
parent activation energies may also include contributions from phase
changes, e.g., vapourisation of volatiles, rendering such apparent ac-
tivation energies as mixtures of intrinsic kinetics and thermodynamic
quantities [125]. It is, however, difficult to perform quantum-
chemistry calculations on cellulose itself because of the size of the
macromolecule.

Reaction mechanisms of LGA formation proposed in literature
have usually been heterolytic (ionic [126]) or homolytic (with free
radicals [42,127]). However, Hosoya et al. [128] proposed a con-
certed reaction mechanism and, later on, Mayes and Broadbelt [129]
demonstrated that a concerted mechanism is more favourable than
heterolytic or homolytic mechanisms for LGA formation with cal-
culations on a larger system.

Vinu and Broadbelt [130] presented a detailed mechanism for
pyrolysis of pure cellulose, and included recent findings obtained

with quantum-mechanical calculations. This model, with concert-
ed reactions, involves chain cleavage to form LGA and NR ends.
LGA formation does not include glucose as an intermediate product,
although LGA can be also produced from glucose. With a degree
of polymerisation lower than 50 in the initial cellulose chain the
reduction of LGA yield is significant, a trend which has been con-
firmed experimentally [131]. The model simultaneously involves
the formation of LGA and NR ends with a 1:1 ratio and equal
stability. Levoglucosan is unzipped simultaneously from the LGA
and NR ends of the cellulose chain. This contrasted with the exist-
ing non-mechanistic picture, in which levoglucosan is formed in a
single step from LGA ends of active cellulose, such as is depicted
in the scheme of Mamleev (Section 3.1.3). The model also sug-
gests that pathways leading to LGA and LMWC are competitive,
confirming the scheme of Piskorz and subsequent schemes. Direct
formation of LMWC, as hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) or formic
acid, has been demonstrated by Agarwal et al. [125] and by Mettler
et al. [132], although the latter used very high temperatures with
homolytic reactions, which may not be dominant at typical, lower
pyrolysis temperatures. The obtained theoretical activation energy
of LGA formation from cellulose in calculations appearing in dif-
ferent works (around 50 kcal/mol [125,129,133]) is in accordance
with experimental values that have been obtained in micro-TGA
experiments. This model from the group of Broadbelt [130] has
been recently further developed [134] and validated [135] by Zhou
et al.

Secondary reactions of tar take place in the gas phase at tem-
peratures over 500 °C, in agreement with experimental data (Section
3.1.1). Pathways with radical mechanisms of secondary reactions of
LGA have been proposed by Zhang et al. [136]. It should be stated
that the pyrolytic pathways of levoglucosan in the vapour- and liquid/
solid-phases are different, as has been shown experimentally by
Hosoya et al. [137].

Agarwal et al. [125,138] also contributed to the understanding
of active cellulose using quantum-mechanical calculations. It is im-
portant to consider the thermal expansion and changes in hydrogen
bonding patterns, from primarily intrachain to mostly interchain,
in order to understand the chemistry that leads to the ILC and py-
rolysis products. Above 175 °C and below 260 °C “reversible active
cellulose” exists in the solid state, which undergoes depolymerisation
via ring contraction to form “liquid intermediate cellulose” (ILC)
above 260 °C [138].

Despite recent advances, a controversy still exists about the actual
reaction mechanisms that take place during pyrolysis of cellulose
[133]. Recent advances include a mechanism for the conversion of
glucose to HMF [139]. Moreover, models need to be extended to
include non-reactive process such as diffusion or vapourisation of
volatile organic compounds, the mechanisms of secondary char-
ring reactions and the effect of metal ions. The presence of metal
cations in biomass accelerates cellulose pyrolysis, suggesting that
ionic chemistry plays an important role [133].

3.1.5. Current understanding

The current understanding of the process of cellulose pyrolysis
is summarised in Fig. 8. Cellulose pyrolysis can be considered as a
two-step process. During primary pyrolysis, after depolymerisation
(R1) and formation of an intermediate liquid compound (active cel-
lulose) – at least in fast pyrolysis – a competition quickly ensues
between fragmentation (R2), which produces mainly LMWC, and
transglycosilation (R3), which produces mainly LGA. LGA is formed
by concerted reactions and not just from LGA-ends, but also from
non-reducing ends. LMWC formation is favoured at higher tem-
peratures and these heterocyclic reactions can be strongly favoured
by the catalytic effect of inorganic species. Primary pyrolysis kinet-
ics can be modelled with a first order one reaction scheme at low
heating rates. There is controversy at high heating rates, but most
probably two reactions (R2 and R3) – that merge at low heating rates
– are required. Detailed experimental data from primary pyrolysis
under different conditions are available in literature [140], includ-
ing the influence of inorganic matter [141].

The products of primary pyrolysis can further undergo second-
ary reactions in the condensed phase or outside the cellulosic matrix.
Char is a secondary product of pyrolysis and its direct production
through reaction R4 is highly questionable [121]. The reaction path-
ways of the charring reactions (R5) are still unclear, but charring
is associated with the production of H2O, CO2 and the formation of
volatile PAH. Secondary charring is favoured at low temperatures
and enhanced with increasing retention time of the volatiles, pres-
sure and presence of inorganics. Cracking of the volatiles (R6) can
be induced inside (heterogeneously) or outside (homogeneously)
the cellulosic matrix. Homogeneous tar cracking in the gas phase,
which produces mainly CO, is relevant for temperatures above 500 °C.

3.2. Hemicellulose

Information about the pyrolysis of hemicellulose in literature is
much more limited than for cellulose. Commercially available xylan
(a straight-chain polymer of xylose) has often been used as a sub-
stitute for hemicellulose. As stated in Section 2.1, xylan is a good
representative of hemicelluloses from hardwoods. The first studies
were conducted by Shafizadeh et al. [142]. Not only large similari-
ties were found between hemicellulose and cellulose pyrolysis, but
also some remarkable differences were noted. Hemicellulose py-
rolysis starts at lower temperatures and it produces more char and
fewer sugars than cellulose [142,143].

Patwardhan et al. [144] experimentally demonstrated that most
of the fundamental aspects of cellulose pyrolysis, summarised in
Fig. 8, are also valid for hemicellulose. Competition occurs between
the formation of sugars (but for example xyloses for xylan, instead
of LGA) and fragmentation products. The presence of AAEM in-
creases the char and CO2 yields while reducing the sugar yield,
whereas no significant change in the yield of CO has been ob-
served. It was also correctly pointed out by Patwardhan et al. [144]
that some works in literature are carried out with a high ash content

hemicellulose, such as commercial xylan, without considering the
great influence of the ashes on the process.

The main decomposition products of xylan are acetic acid, fur-
fural, 1-hydroxy-2-propanone, CO2, CO and H2O [46]. Acetic acid
mainly results from the dissociation of O-acetyl groups that are at-
tached to the main xylan chain [142] and it is produced at low
temperatures [145]. Hexoses and pentoses in hemicellulose have
different pyrolytic behaviours. Di Blasi et al. [146] pointed out that
HMF is a main product in softwood hemicellulose (mainly com-
posed of hexoses) pyrolysis, but is not produced from hardwood
hemicellulose (mainly composed of pentoses). This result has been
corroborated by Räisänen et al. [147], who found HMF in the prod-
ucts of mannose (hexose) but not in those of xylose and arabinose
(pentoses). Moreover, the pyrolytic products of xylose and arabi-
nose are very similar.

Reaction kinetics at low heating rates of xylan can be de-
scribed by two successive reactions, in contrast to cellulose, for which
one reaction is sufficient [148]. Di Blasi and Lanzetta proposed a
scheme with two competitive reactions to predict the yields of solid
and volatile products [149]. However, the same problem arises for
competitive schemes as for the cellulose pyrolysis described in
Section 3.1.2: they do not reflect the influence of retention time of
the volatiles, pressure or presence of inorganics on the final char
yield. Kinetic studies are also available in the literature for
glucomannan. It decomposes in the same temperature range as xylan
[150], and a scheme with two competitive reactions was also able
to describe the mass loss behaviour [45]. The major difference is
the higher char yield of glucomannan, but – as previously stated –
this result should be interpreted with caution, because it may be
influenced by the different ash compositions between commercial
xylan and glucomannan. Gronli et al. [151] conducted micro-TGA
experiments at 5 K/min with 4 hardwood and 5 softwood species.
The reaction rate at low temperatures of softwoods was lower, and
the authors stated that differences in hemicellulose may explain this
fact. The scheme of Ranzi et al. [152], however, indicates that this
inequality is related to differences in hemicellulose content and lignin
composition [48,152,153] (see Section 4.3.3).

Detailed schemes are available for hemicellulose pyrolysis and,
as in the case of cellulose, some of them have been derived from
quantum-mechanical calculations. Possible reaction mechanisms
have been proposed by Wang et al. [46], by Patwardhan et al. [144]
– based on the heterolytic scheme of Ponder and Richards [154] –
and a by Shen et al. [155] – who presented a homolytic scheme.
Based on similarities to cellulose, concerted mechanisms should be
considered in the future for the formation of sugars and hetero-
lytic mechanisms for fragmentation reactions. The reaction
mechanisms of pectin have also been investigated [156].

3.3. Lignin

Lignin has a more complex structure than the polysaccharides
cellulose and hemicellulose, as can be seen by comparing Figs. 1 and

Fig. 9. Scheme for lignin pyrolyis, adapted from Zhou et al. [159].

2. Pyrolysis of lignin takes place over several stages, and its decom-
position occurs over a wider temperature range [143,157]: after lignin
softening at 160–190 °C [158], dehydration reactions occur at around
200 °C, cleavage of α- and β-aryl-alkylether linkages occurs between
150 and 300 °C, cleavage of aliphatic side chains occurs at around
300 °C, cleavage of C—C linkages at around 370–400 °C and cleav-
age of methoxyl groups at around 340 °C for pine (softwood lignin)
and 310 °C for beech (hardwood lignin) [159]. As stated in Section
2.2.2, lignin pyrolysis produces phenolics, water vapour, carbonyls
and alcohols and permanent gases, including CO, CO2 and CH4. Phe-
nolics are the most distinctive group of volatile products resulting
from lignin pyrolysis. CH4 and methanol are also characteristic of
this process, and are produced in high quantities due to the scis-
sion of methoxyl groups [160]. The extra methoxy group in syringil
units of hardwood leads to more charring than in softwood, in-
creasing the CO2, CH4 and char yields [161]. The presence of inorganic
species, such as K, catalyses lignin pyrolysis in a similar way than
for holocellulose, affecting the product composition and accelerat-
ing mass loss, even in a greater extent than for cellulose and
hemicellulose [162].

Despite their complexity, the main global reactions involved in
lignin pyrolysis are known and detailed kinetic schemes are avail-
able in literature. Klein and Virk developed a model [163,164] with
which the lignin structure is described as a sum of single aromat-
ic compounds with two attributes: the type of propanoid side chain
attached to each aromatic ring and the nature of the phenolic or
methoxyphenol substituent on each aromatic ring. The aromatic rings
are not modified during the process. Only the attributes change, pro-
ducing gases, liquids (phenolics, water and methanol) and a solid
product, char, which is composed of all aromatic units involved in
inter-unit bonding. This reaction scheme was developed from a broad
experimental data set. Faravelli et al. [48] proposed a scheme in
which lignin consists of three different components: LIG-C, LIG-H
and LIG-O, which are richer in carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, re-
spectively. Lignin decomposition occurs over several steps, which
corresponds to the broad temperature range of lignin decomposi-
tion. Softwood lignin is richer in LIG-C due to its higher carbon
content; therefore, it reacts at higher temperatures and produces
a higher char yield. The homolytic mechanism of Faravelli et al. [48],
where free radicals are generated, consists of four steps: initia-
tion, propagation and termination of the radicals in a melt phase
and condensation, where the formation of PAH that continuously
grow and cross-link produces char. The fundamental homolytic re-
actions were investigated by Guo et al. [165], and the presence of
radicals in bio-oil, mainly present in condensed volatiles from lignin,
has recently received attention [166,167]. The schemes from Klein
and Virk [163,164] and Faravelli et al. [48] describe the main reac-
tion pathways, but some relevant aspects of lignin pyrolysis are not
considered: the formation of a liquid intermediate, presence of oligo-
mers in volatiles or secondary reactions.

As for cellulose, an intermediate liquid compound is first formed
during pyrolysis. A simplified scheme of lignin pyrolysis derived from
the work of Zhou et al. is shown in Fig. 9 [159], including the for-
mation of this liquid compound, which has been missing in the
previous models. Again, as for cellulose, reactive boiling ejection of

pyrolysis products from this liquid phase is considered the main
mechanism that explains aerosol generation [115,159]. The inter-
mediate liquid compound also provides a reactive medium for
secondary charring reactions.

During primary pyrolysis mainly pyrolytic lignin is produced. The
molecules that have been considered in previous schemes are only
single ring phenolic units, but pyrolytic lignin also consists of oligo-
mers (di-, tri- and tetramers are the most abundant) of these single
ring units [73]. A proposed structure of a pyrolytic lignin mole-
cule is shown in Fig. 4, which resembles the original lignin structure.
As shown in Fig. 9, pyrolytic lignin is produced during primary py-
rolysis together with permanent gases and light condensable species,
such as water, carbonyls and alcohols. Char is included as a product
here, although it is believed to be mainly (or exclusively) a second-
ary product, as for cellulose [159].

In secondary reactions, that may take place inside the matrix or
in the gas phase when the volatiles leave it, pyrolytic lignin can
further react, producing not only other phenolic oligomers (pyro-
lytic lignin derivates), but also phenolic monomers, char, gases and
light condensable species. The molecular weight is on average
reduced during these secondary reactions, but phenolic oligomers
can also arise from re-oligomerisation [168]. Detailed mecha-
nisms of formation of monomers and oligomers have been described
by Kotake et al. [169]. Fast pyrolysis produce phenolics with higher
degree of oligomerisation [81].

The characteristic functional groups of phenolic compounds also
change during these reactions. This is schematically shown in Fig. 10
where, for reasons of clarity, just single ring units are depicted. The
scheme was adapted in Ref. 85 from that published in Asmadi et al.
[170] and previous publications by the same group [71,161,171,172].

Primary tars consist of guaiacol and syringol (in hardwood lignin)
units, which resemble the original lignin structure. Secondary re-
actions produce secondary tars: phenols, catechols, pyrogallols,
cresols or xylenols. Tertiary tars (BTX/PAH) can, afterwards, be pro-
duced from secondary tars. During secondary reactions, the reduction
of the tar yield from lignin is slower than the reduction of tar yield
from holocellulose [68] due to the higher stability of the aromatic
structure. A detailed scheme of production of BTX/PAH in the gas
phase is presented in Nowakowska et al. [173]. The production of
PAH is enhanced at high temperatures, but they are already pro-
duced at low temperatures (T < 500 °C), as shown by many studies
with different conditions [79,81,85,86,174]. PAH mainly originate
from lignin [88,107]. During secondary heterogeneous reactions, the
size of PAH increases [88]. Moreover, as for holocellulose, PAH pro-
duction is linked to exothermic charring [87].

Kinetics to predict mass loss evolution of lignin with a single re-
action are available in the literature, but the reported range of
activation energies is very broad [37,175], from 20 to 200 kJ/mol.
Determination of kinetics with one reaction is inherently difficult,
because this process takes place over several stages. Low values may
arise from the erroneous assumption of a first order reaction, or due
to reliance on a single heating rate experiment to determine the ac-
tivation energy, as pointed out by Jiang et al. [176] and Anca-
Couce et al. [175]. When lignin kinetics are determined in a
consistent way, high values within the previous range are
obtained. These values for the activation energy actually match the
ones that dominate in the previously described detailed kinetic
schemes [48,163], which can describe the mass loss evolution, as
well as product composition, with reasonable accuracy. Determi-
nation of kinetics will be treated in detail in Section 4.1. As for
cellulose and hemicellulose, competitive schemes are also avail-
able that can be used to predict the solid and volatiles yield [177].
However, the same problem arises as for the cellulose pyrolysis de-
scribed in Section 3.1.2: they do not reflect the influence of retention
time of the volatiles, pressure or presence of inorganics on the final
char yield.

4. Kinetic schemes and product composition of biomass
pyrolysis

After individually analyzing the pyrolysis mechanisms of biomass
components, in this section we will review the kinetic schemes and
product composition of lignocellulosic biomass pyrolysis. We will
focus on kinetics to predict mass loss evolution in Section 4.1, the
experimentally obtained product composition under different con-
ditions in Section 4.2, kinetic schemes in Section 4.3 and the heat
of reaction in Section 4.4. Finally, an analysis of two special pro-
cesses, oxidative pyrolysis and torrefaction, is presented in Section
4.5.

4.1. Mass loss kinetics

Kinetics of biomass to predict mass loss evolution is usually de-
termined by TGA and conducted with small samples at low heating
rates to ensure the absence of heat and mass transport limita-
tions, i.e., to be under a kinetically controlled regime (see Section
5.1.1). Difficulties in determining kinetics at high temperatures/
heating rates were pointed out in Section 3.1.2. The reaction rate
(dα/dt, being α conversion) over temperature in a TGA experi-
ment with pine wood at a constant heating rate of 10 K/min is shown
in Fig. 11 [178]. The main peak corresponds to cellulose; the
shoulder at lower temperatures, to hemicellulose; and lignin de-
composition covers a wider temperature range, including the tail
at high temperatures.

There are two main mathematical approaches used to analyse
the data in order to obtain the kinetics data: model-based (model-

Fig. 11. Normalised mass loss and reaction rate over temperature for pyrolysis of
pine wood at 10 K/min. Experimental data in points, model with three pseudo-
components in solid line and each pseudo-component in dashed lines (adapted from
Anca-Couce et al. [178]).

fitting) and isoconversional (model-free) methods [124,175,179,180].
Isoconversional (model-free) methods can be used to compute kinetic
parameters during conversion without model-based assumptions,
such as an a priori first order reaction. In these methods the acti-
vation energies are calculated at fixed conversions, taking advantage
of the fact that the reaction rate depends exclusively on the reac-
tion temperature. There are integral isoconversional methods, such
as the Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose (KAS) [181,182], Flynn–Wall–
Ozawa (FWO) [183,184] or Vyazovkin [185] methods; and differential
methods, such as the Friedman method. In model-based methods,
a reaction model must be postulated first. The most appropriate re-
action model can solely be selected on the basis of the quality of
the regression fit. Nonlinear least squares fitting is the method most
commonly employed in the biomass community to fit experimen-
tal data and evaluate the Arrhenius parameters. First and nth order
reaction models are usually selected. It is recommended to employ
the reaction rate (as in Fig. 11) instead of mass loss over time/
temperature for the fitting because the details of devolatilisation
are better shown [148].

The description of biomass pyrolysis with just one component
is not precise enough. Biomass pyrolysis is assumed to be approx-
imately the sum of the inputs of the respective main components:
cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin [151]. Pyrolysis can be de-
scribed with a parallel reaction scheme in which three pseudo-
components usually represent the main biomass components,
although more components can be employed. However, the pro-
portions of each pseudo-component do not correspond exactly to
the composition of the real components because of the influence
of mineral matter, different char yields and interactions among the
components [37]. Moreover, the final char yield has to be a priori
defined in this scheme; this scheme predicts the mass loss evolu-
tion over time but not the variations in product composition at
different pyrolysis conditions.

Some studies obtain the pyrolysis kinetics using model-fitting
methods solely with experiments conducted at one heating rate
[143,151]. Branca et al. [186], Anca-Couce et al. [175] or Sánchez-
Jiménez et al. [187] have criticised this, though. Force fitting models
to non-isothermal data obtained from a single heating rate can gen-
erate very inconsistent Arrhenius parameters that display a strong
dependence on the kinetic model selected [124]. Compensation
effects can be avoided by employing several heating rates, i.e., dif-
ferent combinations of pre-exponential factors and activation
energies can describe the same weight loss curve reasonably well.
Only one set of data can predict the behaviour of the material at
several heating rates [37].

Fig. 12. Activation energies reported in literature for the biomass pseudo-components. Data obtained with experiments performed at several heating rates (except 11): 1
[188], 2 [189], 3 [177], 4 [190], 5 [186], 6 [191], 7 [192], 8 [193], 9 [194], 10 [195], 11 [151], 12 [143]. When several values are reported in one study, only the mean value
is shown (adapted from Anca-Couce et al. [175]).

As reviews have indicated, activation energies vary widely in
the literature for each pseudo-component in the parallel reaction
scheme [37,124,175]. Fig. 12 presents an overview (data from Refs.
143, 151, 177, 186, and 188–195). The included values in the
figure are only obtained from works in which several heating
rates were investigated, except for the reference work of Gronli
et al. [151]. The activation energies of the pseudo-components in
the parallel reaction scheme usually resemble the activation ener-
gies of the original components. As stated in Section 3.1.2, pure
cellulose pyrolysis (for low heating rates) can be described with a
first order reaction model with a high activation energy
(191–253 kJ/mol according to Antal et al. [119]). The main compo-
nent for biomass in the parallel reaction scheme representing the
cellulose peak usually has activation energies in the range of
190–250 kJ/mol, close to the values for pure cellulose. Further-
more, the literature usually reports a lower activation energy value
for the hemicellulose pseudo-component than for cellulose, but
usually the activation energy is still high (150–200 kJ/mol). The
reported range of activation energies for lignin is very broad [37,175],
from 20 to 200 kJ/mol, as stated in Section 3.3. The widely varying
kinetic data reported in recent years in the literature have sparked
concern among researches about the reliability of the reported
pyrolysis experiments and the analysis of the data [37,124,175,196].
The following recommendations were suggested to determine ki-
netics in a consistent way by Anca-Couce et al. [175]:

• To first reproduce the reference experiments with pure cellu-

lose (Avicel PH 105) from Gronli et al. [122].

• To perform and analyse experiments with different heating rates.
• To employ integral isoconversional methods to verify the relia-
bility of the experiments and to avoid selecting inappropriate
reaction models in a fitting routine.

The first recommendation is done to validate the thermo-
gravimetric analysis and to ensure the absence of heat and mass
transport limitations. The International Confederation for Thermal
Analysis and Calorimetry (ICTAC) has presented further advices for
the collection of data in a kinetically controlled regime [197]. Ex-
periments conducted at different heating rates are recommended
to avoid compensation effects, as previously explained. Khawam and
Flanagan [179] suggested the complementary use of isoconversional

and model-based methods to determine solid state reaction kinetic
parameters from experimental data. Activation energies can be first
predicted by using isoconversional methods. The most accurate re-
action model can be then chosen, by using model-based methods,
in order to arrive at an activation energy that is close to the one
obtained from the isoconversional analysis. Thus, the selection of
the most appropriate reaction model is in this way potentially more
consistent than when the quality of the regression fit alone is used
as a basis [179]. Moreover, quality of the linear fitting in Arrhenius
plots of integral isoconversional methods for the different conver-
sions can verify the reliability of the experiments. Compensation
effects or assuming first order kinetic models can lead to errone-
ous kinetic parameters, particularly leading to an underestimation
of the activation energy of lignin pyrolysis, as stated in Section 3.3.
By following the recommendations above, consistent kinetics should
be obtained.

Isoconversional methods are not commonly employed by
members of the biomass pyrolysis community, but their popular-
ity has recently increased. Differential isoconversional methods are
very sensitive to noise, therefore integral methods are usually pre-
ferred. Generally, high activation energies are obtained, with
variations during conversion [180,198–200]. Activation energies at
different conversion levels can be approximately associated to
biomass components: hemicellulose at low, cellulose at medium and
lignin at high conversion levels. Different integral isoconversional
methods, such as KAS, FWO or Vyazovkin, deliver very similar results
for the same data set.

The complexity of biomass pyrolysis has led to the employ-
ment of more complex models than the previously presented ones,
with one reaction and a single activation energy for each compo-
nent. Distributed activation energy models (DAEM) assume that
decomposition takes place over a large number of independent, par-
allel reactions with different activation energies, which reflects
variations in the bond strengths of species. The difference in acti-
vation energies can be represented by a continuous distribution
function. This model was recently reviewed by Cai et al. [201]. Kinetic
parameters can be estimated by distribution-fitting (as in Varhegyi
et al. [202]) or distribution-free methods (with the Miura differ-
ential or Miura–Maki integral method [203,204]). Gaussian
distributions are usually employed, although others such as Weibull
[205] are possible. The entire pyrolysis process, for example, including

almost finished, even at high heating rates (see Section 3.1.2) and
homogeneous tar cracking starts. Gomez-Barea and Leckner [215]
reviewed homogeneous tar cracking kinetics. For a retention time
of 0.5 s, the tar conversion for all tar components was below 10%
w.t. for temperatures lower than 500 °C and around 50% at 600–
700 °C. The main products of homogeneous tar cracking are CO and
H2 [75,216,217]. Tar cracking can be produced at lower tempera-
tures, but is heterogeneously and catalysed by char [76,85,218].
Actually heterogeneous tar cracking may be linked to charring. CO2
is reported as a main product of heterogeneous tar cracking [76],
as well as in charring (see Section 3.1.2 and Fig. 8).

The results of micro and macro experiments on product com-

position will be analysed in detail in the next subsections.

4.2.1. Micro experiments

The term micro experiments refers in this work to experi-
ments in which heat and mass transfer transport limitations, as well
as secondary reactions, are minimised. Obtaining a detailed product
characterisation is challenging under these conditions due to the
low initial mass that has to be employed. Data from four publica-
tions describing TGA experiments at a constant heating rate are
reviewed here [219–222]. The initial masses were lower than 20 mg,
heating rates lower than 30 K/min and product composition was
measured either with FTIR [219–221] or GC [222].

The yields of main products are presented in Fig. 14. Experi-
ments until a final temperature of 900 °C at different heating rates
or with different pre-treatments (washing or extraction) are in-
cluded: 3 with wood pellets and 3 with miscanthus from de Jong
et al. [219], 4 with pine, 4 with beech and 4 with thistle from Gómez
et al. [222,223] and 1 with wheat straw from Bassilakis et al. [220].
Clear differences are noted between woody and herbaceous species.
Variations in contents of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin in these
species are not dramatic [38], and the main difference is the higher
ash content of herbaceous biomass. Herbaceous biomass yields more
char, CO2 and H2O (with a higher uncertainty for the last one), while
producing a similar amount of CO as woody biomass.

The release of the presented volatile components is highest ap-
proximately at the maximum total reaction rate, and is almost
finished (>90%) at 500 °C for all cases but for CO (74% release). Ho-
mogeneous tar cracking did not took place in these experiments
because the release of tar compounds was finished before the tem-
perature reached 500 °C. CO and H2 were the main products of char
devolatilisation produced at high temperatures (>600 °C). CH4 release,
which was approximately 1% in mass and mainly linked to lignin,
was delayed compared to other compounds because lignin reacts

the hemicellulose shoulder, cannot be described with one single
DAEM. As described previously, three parallel DAEM representing
cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin are more suitable. Results ap-
plying this method [202,206] show that standard deviations for the
activation energy of cellulose and hemicellulose are low (around
1 and 5 kJ/mol, respectively). However, this value is much higher
for lignin, around 40 kJ/mol. We can conclude that the extra com-
plexity of a DAEM is not required to model cellulose and
hemicellulose mass loss kinetics, which can be well described with
first order reactions, but that the DAEM is indeed a good alterna-
tive to describe lignin pyrolysis, covering the wide temperature range
of this multi-stage process.

4.2. Product composition: experimental data

Products of biomass pyrolysis are usually classified as solids
(char), liquids (mainly tar) and gases. The main product groups of
volatiles and their origins were presented in Sections 2.2.2 and 3.
Comparison between the liquids produced from each biomass com-
ponent can be found in the publications of Evans and Milne [68–70]
or in more recent publications [207–209], as well as for perma-
nent gases [88,210,211]. Pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass can be
approximated as the sum of the contributions of the biomass com-
ponents, but this approach is not exact because of the interactions
among them [71,212,213].

The thicknesses of the lines in Fig. 13 show typical relative pro-
portions of char, tar and gas formation as a result of cellulose and
lignin pyrolysis. The figure for hemicellulose would be similar to
the one for cellulose, but with a higher char yield. At tempera-
tures up to around 500 °C mainly liquids are produced from cellulose.
In contrast, the char yield from lignin is higher than for cellulose.
During secondary reactions, at temperatures higher than 500 °C, the
tar yield from cellulose dramatically decreases, whereas the gas yield
increases considerably. Tertiary tar (BTX/PAH), produced mainly at
high temperatures, arises predominately from lignin, as explained
in Section 2.2.2. Stable aromatic compounds can be produced from
cellulose, as explained in Section 3.1.2, although at a lower con-
centration than from lignin. Moreover, char undergoes a further
devolatilisation at high temperatures releasing permanent gases as
CO [214].

Five hundred degrees Celsius was selected as the cut-off point
in Fig. 13 for two reasons: at this temperature primary pyrolysis is

later than holocellulose (see Fig. 11). Formation of compounds from
other volatile groups in micro experiments was not investigated in
detail in the literature, except for some carbonyls and alcohols and
the release of nitrogenous compounds, which were analysed by de
Jong et al. [219].

It is also interesting to compare the results obtained with washed
and untreated samples by Gómez et al. [222,223] and Jensen et al.
[221] (the last one with wheat straw samples) in Table 2. The rel-
ative percentages of yields of the washed samples, compared to the
untreated samples, are presented in the table. Washing reduced the
ash content to approximately two-thirds of the original one for
samples of Gómez et al. [222,223] (68%) and one-third for the
samples of Jensen et al. [221] (38.6%). As a consequence, lower char,
CO2 and H2O yields were obtained for the washed samples. The CO
yield was reduced to a lower extent (the relative yields for the
washed samples were higher). These results confirm the previous
trends for herbaceous and woody biomass.

The total yield of the detected compounds in the experiments
presented in this subsection is approximately 50%. The remaining
products are mainly condensable species, but they have not been
characterised in detail. A high tar yield has been obtained due to
the low residence time of the volatiles inside the particle, which
reduces secondary reactions. The composition of the condensable
species is very different for each biomass component and detailed
characterisations have been presented in Section 3 for micro ex-
periments with cellulose [140,141], hemicellulose [144] and lignin
[159].

4.2.2. Macro experiments

Macro experiments refer in this work to experiments con-
ducted under conditions in which heat and mass transfer limitations
are present, as well as secondary reactions. This is the case in most
of the practical applications (see Section 5.1.1). A comprehensive lit-
erature review of measurements of product composition in different
reaction configurations (mainly macro conditions) was conducted
by Neves et al. [53] (see Fig. 15). Results were classified according
to fast and slow heating rates, with 1 K/s as the threshold.

As previously done, experiments with temperatures up to 500 °C
will be analysed first, a temperature at which most of the volatiles
have been already released. Char and tar are the most abundant
products of the process. Char and CO2 yields are higher at slow
heating rates, while the tar yield is lower. Differences are lower for
the CO and CH4 yields; while there is a broad range of the H2O yields
reported in literature. Considering both micro and macro experi-
ments, it can be concluded that when charring is promoted, as in
slow pyrolysis or when a higher ash content acts as catalyst, yields
of char, CO2 and H2O are enhanced while the total tar yield is reduced.
As reviewed in Section 3, tar is composed of carbonyls and alco-
hols, heterocyclics, sugars and phenolics. The sugar content is strongly
reduced by the presence of ash, yielding more carbonyls and alco-
hols and heterocyclic compounds, while the phenolic content
depends on the initial amount of lignin, and is highly variable in
lignocellulosic biomass. BTX/PAH are already produced at these tem-
peratures [224], mainly from lignin.

At higher temperatures (>500 °C), the CO and H2 yields in-
crease dramatically, as does the CH4 yield while tar and char yields
are reduced. CO2 and H2O yields do not almost change. This is mainly

due to secondary tar cracking reactions that occur high tempera-
tures and also, to a minor extent, due to char devolatilisation at high
temperatures [157]. With enough residence times, at around 700 °C
almost all carbonyls and alcohols, heterocyclics and sugars have
cracked and at around 950 °C almost all phenolics have as well,
leaving just BTX/PAH [68].

A pyrolysis scheme is presented in Fig. 16 based on an under-
standing of biomass pyrolysis as presented in this section and in
Section 3 for the individual components. This scheme describes py-
rolysis as a two-step process: primary pyrolysis and secondary
charring. Moreover, secondary tar cracking and char devolatilisation
can occur at high temperatures. As in Fig. 13, the thicknesses of the
lines show the typical relative proportions of char, tar and gas, and
500 °C was selected as the cut-off point for the reasons previously
explained.

4.2.3. Release of minor elements

As stated in Section 2.1, elements other than carbon, oxygen and
hydrogen are present in biomass, although in minor concentra-
tions. Some of these elements (such as N, K, Na, Cl or S) are though
very relevant, because their release can lead to several problems
such as PM, NOx, HCl and SOx emissions, corrosion or deposit build
up [66]. Aerosols forming PM or leading to deposits can have organic
(organic oxygenated molecules, probably released from liquid in-
termediates [115], or soot produced from PAH at high temperatures)
or inorganic natures. Therefore, the release of inorganics is of high
relevance.

Intermediate nitrogen species, such as hydrogen cyanide (HCN),
ammonia (NH3) and isocyanuric acid (HNCO), can be released during
pyrolysis to the gas phase. These intermediates can then produce
N2 under reducing conditions or NOx under oxidising conditions at
high temperatures [225]. The direct release of these molecules in
micro-TGA experiments was investigated by de Jong et al. [219]. Ni-
trogen is also significantly retained in the char and bounded to the
released tars. Cracking of these tars can also release more nitrogen-
containing intermediate species [226].

The release of inorganic elements strongly depends on the tem-
perature. Over 90% of the alkali metals (K and Na) are available for
release [65] but their release during pyrolysis is usually limited.
Values in the range of 10% K release are reported for temperatures
up to 700 °C for straw and wood [65,227–229]. At temperatures
greater than 700 °C the K release increases progressively, reaching
25% at 1050 °C for straw [228], for example. On the other hand, an
almost complete release of Cl and a very high release of S are ob-
tained during pyrolysis [230]. Chlorine is released in two stages from
straw [228]: about 60% as temperature increased from 200 to 400 °C
and the remaining amount, between 700 and 900 °C. Between one-
third and half of S is released at 500 °C for agricultural residues [229].
Factors other than temperature influence the release of inorganics.
Secondary reactions between the volatile alkali species and char
reduces their release. K can be retained in carboxyl and phenolic
groups or intercalated in the char matrix [231]. The retention of
inorganics increases with increasing particle size [232], especially
at higher temperatures where more stable compounds are gener-
ated [227]. On the other hand, experiments conducted in order to
minimise secondary reactions have led to an almost complete release
of K at 800 °C [233]. The presence of a flow of forced gas through
the bed can increase the release [234] while a higher bed height
can suppress it [235]. The release of Cl during pyrolysis is also
reduced when more secondary reactions take place [236]. Moreover,
the relative abundance of other elements influences the release
behaviour, especially at high temperatures. K release is facilitated
in the presence of Cl and suppressed in the presence of Si [233,237],
in the latter case due to the possible formation of silicates, which
also depends on the concentration of other elements [238]. In con-
trast, the sulphur release is increased in Si-rich samples [229].

As previously mentioned for cellulose in Section 3.1.1, the
inorganics have an influence on the pyrolysis process, in that they
act as catalysts. Potassium, an alkali species, has an important in-
fluence in that it accelerates the pyrolysis process, reducing the yield
of sugars and increasing charring [239]. Not all inorganics, however,
have the same influence, although the previous trends have been
generally observed [240]. Investigations were conducted for the
effects of impregnated inorganics that are usually present in minor
concentrations in biomass, such as iron and nickel [241]. Catalysts

such as zeolites are also commonly employed in the pyrolysis process
to upgrade the pyrolysis vapours, reducing their oxygen content [15].

4.2.4. Solid and char yields

A final comment should be made about the solid and char yield
to complete this section, analysing the experimental product com-
position. Results of the low temperature experiments (torrefaction,
which will be analysed in detail in Section 4.5.2) of Broström et al.
[242] are shown in Table 3. Dry wood chips of spruce are pyrolyaed

process is partially or completely conducted at low temperatures.
This fact can be derived from the combined analysis of the solid
yields and fixed carbon yields of these experiments.

4.3. Product composition: reaction schemes

Following the review of the experimental composition of prod-
ucts in the previous section, the reaction schemes to predict product
composition will be analysed in this section.

4.3.1. Competitive schemes

The single component scheme with several competitive reac-
tions, called from now on the competitive scheme, was first proposed
by Shafizadeh and Chin [243]. It is the most commonly employed
to describe the product composition of biomass pyrolysis, for
example, in particle and reactor models as will be explained in
Section 5.1.2 and in Section 5.2, respectively. In this scheme, de-
picted in Fig. 17, the reaction products are lumped in three categories:
char, tar and gas. Primary pyrolysis is described as the stage during
which the competition between the formation of char, tars and gas
occurs. Primary tar can then further react in a secondary reaction
to produce more permanent gases and, in some cases, secondary
char. The reaction kinetics of primary pyrolysis in the competitive
scheme are scarce [244]. Common kinetics employed in literature
are the ones of Chan et al. [245], Wagenaar et al. [246], Thurner and
Mann [247] and Di Blasi and Branca [248]. The most frequently em-
ployed sets of tar cracking kinetic data are the ones calculated by
Liden et al. [249], and the exothermic heat of reaction as deter-
mined by Koufopanos et al. [250]. The variation proposed by Di Blasi,
which includes the production of secondary char [251], as shown
in Fig. 17, is sometimes included. These tar cracking kinetics were
derived from data of fluidised bed flash pyrolysis of hardwood and
it has been claimed by the authors that they are valid for most
biomass particles under 2 mm in size when pyrolysed in a fluidised
bed reactor at temperatures of 450 °C or higher; but, they were
applied to very different conditions. As stated in the previous section,
homogeneous tar cracking kinetics predict significant tar conver-
sions at temperatures higher than 500 °C. It should be noted that
the secondary production of char in the competitive scheme cor-
responds to its production at high temperatures from tar cracking,
shown in Fig. 16, but not to the low temperature secondary char-
ring. Competitive schemes have also been proposed for each biomass
component, including active components, by Koufopanos et al. [177]
and Miller and Bellan [252].

The competitive scheme will now be critically evaluated. Dif-
ferences between the predictions of the available kinetic data sets
for primary pyrolysis in the literature are huge, and the observed
trends are sometimes not even uniform. Running a prediction
with some of them will result in an increase in the yield of one
product with higher reaction temperature, while a decrease is
predicted when other kinetic data are used. This happens, in fact,
in the case of the gas or tar yield [244]. The char yield diminishes
with increasing temperature but in a different way and with dif-
ferent values, according to the set of kinetic data used. As for
cellulose (see Section 3.1.2), the char yield in biomass pyrolysis
depends on:

with residence times between 8 and 25 min and low process tem-
peratures, between 260 and 310 °C. The obtained solid yield (SY)
is lower with more severe temperature programs. Additionally, the
fixed carbon (FC) content of the solid product, after torrefaction, is
determined. Determining the FC carbon is equivalent to determin-
ing the char yield from the sample at defined conditions, the ones
specified by the applied norm. The original wood has an FC content
of 14.6%. Pyrolysis over 25 minutes at 310 °C produces a solid yield
of 45.9% (experiment (e) in Table 3). One may initially think that
this is the char yield, but in fact, the pyrolysis process is not yet com-
pleted at these low temperatures. The fixed carbon content, related
to the original material (FC*SY), is 21.9%. It is higher than that found
in the original material, as pyrolysis at low temperatures/heating
rates promotes charring, but still much lower than the solid yield.
Two conclusions can be derived from these experiments. The first
one, which is actually trivial, is that not all the solid product cor-
responds in all cases to char. Low temperature processes, such as
torrefaction, produc a solid product that is a mixture between orig-
inal biomass and char. The distinction between biomass and char
is not clearly defined, because this is actually a gradual process.
However, the solid material produced at 500 °C is without doubt
char, even though it can still liberate volatiles if heated at higher
temperatures. The second conclusion is that the FC content does
not always correspond to the char yield. Lower or higher char yields
than those calculated during FC determination can be obtained when
minimising/maximising charring or increasing/reducing the final
temperature. Higher char yields are obtained when the pyrolysis

increased from 20 to 40%. The competitive scheme cannot predict
any of these differences in a general way.

The competitive scheme can provide a first approximation for
biomass pyrolysis but it lacks the ability to predict product com-
position at different conditions. Care should be taken when applying
this scheme to different conditions from the ones from which the
kinetic data were derived. Moreover, compounds with very differ-
ent properties are lumped in one category in this scheme, e.g., both
water and phenolic compounds belong to the liquid phase. In ad-
dition, the scheme is quite questionable from the point of view of
analytical chemistry [37]. In the opinion of this reviewer, the use
of more detailed schemes should be promoted in the future.

4.3.2. Coal devolatilisation schemes

Coal devolatilisation schemes have been adapted to predict
biomass pyrolysis. The main models that have been employed are:
the functional group – depolymerisation, vapourisation and cross-
linking (FG-DVC) model [219,257], bio-Flashchain (BFC) [258] and
bio chemical percolation devolatilisation (CPD) [259–261].

The FG-DVC model, developed by Chen et al. [257] and also
applied by de Jong et al. [219] and Wolfinger [262], combines a func-
tional group (FG) model to describe the evolution of the gas species
with the depolymerisation, vapouriation and cross-linking (DVC)
model for tar and char formation. The DVC model simulates coal
as a macromolecular network of condensed ring clusters which are
linked by strong and weak bridges. However, in the biomass version
of the model the DVC part is less relevant and the evolution of tar
is described with the FG model [219]. Therefore, the release of CO,
CO2, H2O, CH4 or tars is modelled with one or more FG models
[219,262]. The evolution of each FG is described with a DAEM. The
FG-DVC model provides a precise evolution over time of the release
of the volatile species, but the main drawback is that the model is
only applicable for the conditions and fuels for which they were de-
veloped. For example, the tar yield is an input of the model and
cannot be calculated as a function of the process conditions.

The BFC (bio-Flashchain) model developed by Niksa [258] con-
siders biomass as a mixture of cellulose and a lignin-like component.
The chain macromolecules of the biomass structure are described
with bridges, which are the monomers in the chain, e.g., glucose
for cellulose. The bridges can be decomposed by scission, produc-
ing smaller fragments that can be afterwards released as tar, light
condensable species and gases. Moreover, bridges and dehydrated
bridges, which are the condensed-phase products of bridge scis-
sion, can produce char links, which are unbreakable connections
that recombine with the nascent char matrix. As opposite to coal,
refractory aromatic nuclei are absent for biomass. The chain frag-
ments that can suffer scission or condensation are classified by size
into groups: reactant and intermediate fragments, and metaplast.
Fragments can only suffer the previously described reactions.
Metaplast are lighter fragments and they can also recombine. More-
over, all tar precursors are actually metaplasts that are in a vapour
– condensed phase equilibrium. Tar formation is described in analogy
to a flash distillation process. Char devolatilisation at high tem-
peratures, releasing the heteroatoms, mainly as CO and H2, is included
in the scheme. The reaction rates for scission, condensation and char
devolatilisation are described with DAEMs.

The bio CPD model developed by Sheng and Azevedo [259] and
improved by Fletcher and coworkers [260,261] considers cellu-
lose, hemicellulose and lignin. The structure is modelled as aromatic
clusters connected by bridges. The parameters that define the struc-
ture, such as molecular weights of the clusters, are determined for
coal by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments. In the
case of biomass, some parameters are determined by NMR experi-
ments while other parameters are directly obtained from the known
structures of the biomass components. In pyrolysis, the bridges are
activated and there is a competition between scission and char

pyrolysis kinetics of Chan et al. (Achar = 1.1·107 s−1, Echar = 121.3 kJ/mol, Atar = 2.0·108 s−1,
Etar = 133.1 kJ/mol, Agas = 1.3·108 s−1, Egas = 140.3 kJ/mol) [245].

• Temperature program: heating rate and maximum temperature.
• Amount of secondary reactions: retention time of the volatiles

or pressure.

• Biomass composition: macromolecules and inorganics.

The competitive scheme only predicts differences in char yield
at different heating rates or different constant temperatures. Dif-
ferences in char, gas and tar yields predicted by applying the kinetics
of Chan et al. [245] are shown in Fig. 18. The kinetic scheme has
been applied at different heating rates, in a similar way as it was
done for cellulose pyrolysis (see Section 3.1.2). The employed pre-
exponential factors and activation energies are stated in the legend
of the figure. Char formation, with low activation energy, is fa-
voured at low heating rates while gas and tar formation is favoured
at high heating rates. A char yield of 29.3% is predicted at 20 K/min,
a typical heating rate for slow pyrolysis in a fixed-bed, while a char
yield of 21.4% is predicted at 2000 K/min, a typical heating rate for
fast pyrolysis in a fluidised-bed. It can be seen that these kinetics
can predict significant differences in char yields for slow and fast
pyrolysis.

Now, the other factors influencing the char yield will be analysed.
As for cellulose, maximum temperature, retention time of the
volatiles, or presence of inorganics have a significant influence on
the char yield. For example, in experiments with pine wood con-
ducted at 10 K/min [178], the char yield decreased from 24 to 21.5%
when the maximum pyrolysis temperature was increased from 450
to just 500 °C. In experiments done by Alves and Figueirido [253]
with pine wood, a char yield of 18% was obtained with a sample
of 10 mg. When experiments were done with cylinders of 18 mm
diameter at similar heating rates, the char yield was increased to
22% due to the enhancement of secondary reactions. In experi-
ments with oak wood conducted by Mok [61], the char yield
increased from 14.5 to 18% when a lower flow rate was employed,
thus increasing the retention time of the volatiles and, therefore,
the secondary reactions. Ash constituents, especially potassium,
sodium and calcium (AAEM), are known to favour char formation
remarkably well [37]. Moreover, the macromolecular composition
of the species plays a main role. When the lignin content of biomass
is higher, the obtained char yield increases [254–256]. According
to the relationship established by Hashimoto et al. [256], from ex-
periments conducted with small samples (3–4 mg) of several biomass
species at low heating rates and maximum temperatures of 900 °C,
the char yield increased from 16 to 22% when the lignin content

formation. These reactions are described with DAEMs. Percolation
statistics are employed to describe the bridge breaking and the size
of the formed fragments. The tar yield is calculated in analogy to
a flash distillation process, as in the BFC model.

The main limitation of coal devolatilisation models is the dif-
ference in structure between biomass and coal. Coal is mainly
composed of condensed polyaromatic compounds, which is just par-
tially the case for lignin, while cellulose and hemicellulose are more
similar to chains [259]. Moreover, other factors such as the cata-
lytic effect of ashes are not considered [258]. Despite their limitations,
these models have produced results with a reasonable accuracy and
they provide a valuable knowledge for biomass pyrolysis, especial-
ly for secondary charring. The differences in structure lead to a
greater uncertainty when they are applied to describe primary py-
rolysis of the biomass components.

4.3.3. Detailed schemes: Ranzi and RAC schemes

Detailed schemes are required to be able to describe the complex
reactions that take place during biomass pyrolysis. Reaction schemes
for biomass macrocomponents were presented in Section 3. The
most promising scheme in the literature for biomass pyrolysis
thus far published is the one found in Ranzi et al. [152,263–265].
The last version appears in Corbetta et al. [266]. It is a multi-
component mechanism whereby biomass pyrolysis is described by
the superposition of different sub-mechanisms for each biomass
pseudo-component: cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Twenty rep-
resentative species are considered to describe the volatiles. Simplified
mechanisms are presented for each component and they are derived
from semi-detailed kinetic schemes. The cellulose pyrolysis mech-
anism from the Ranzi scheme is based on the scheme of Piskorz et al.
(see Fig. 19 and Fig. 5). The product composition of the fragmen-
tation reaction (R2, (Vol. + Char)1,1) consists of 10 species, including
permanent gases, carbonyls and alcohols, furans and a low quan-

tity of char. Hemicellulose decomposition is described with a two-
step scheme, resembling the one for cellulose in the first step. The
lignin scheme is a simplification of the detailed scheme of Faravelli
et al. [48] presented in Section 3.3. Lignin decomposition occurs in
several steps, which corresponds to the broad temperature range
of these reactions. Char is not simply produced as pure carbon, but
also as several G{} forms which react further at higher tempera-
tures producing CO2, CO or H2, i.e., char devolatilisation. The G{} forms
represent volatiles trapped within a metaplastic phase. Moreover,
the same group has a detailed kinetic scheme available to
model secondary homogeneous reactions of the volatiles
[152,268,269].

The initial biomass composition that can be applied to this kinetic
scheme can be calculated from the elemental analysis [265]. Rep-
resentative initial compositions of hardwood and softwood to predict
their different pyrolytic behaviours have also been suggested [153].
It was verified that the scheme provides generally correct predic-
tions for mass loss evolution in micro-TGA experiments [263] and
for product composition under different conditions, mainly in fast
pyrolysis experiments [152,266,270].

The main advantages of the Ranzi scheme are:

1. Biomass pyrolysis can be predicted by the sum of the contribu-

tions of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin.

2. Mechanistic schemes, although simplified (semi-detailed), are

presented for each component.

3. The scheme can correctly predict mass loss evolution. The re-
ported activation energies are in accordance with what was
described in Section 4.1.

4. A detailed product characterisation is presented, including 5 per-
manent gases (CO, CO2, CH4, C2H4 and H2), 8 carbonyls and
alcohols, 3 monomeric phenolics, 2 sugars (including LGA), 1 het-
erocyclic (HMF) and water vapour. Lumped approaches, such as

62

grouping all liquid compounds at ambient temperature, are
avoided.

5. Char devolatilisation at high temperatures is introduced in the

scheme.

There are however some limitations:

1. The scheme describes primary pyrolysis and secondary gas-
phase cracking of the volatiles, but secondary charring reactions
are not directly included. As previously described (see Fig. 16)
charring reactions play a crucial role during biomass pyrolysis
but this scheme cannot predict the variable extent of charring
under different conditions.

2. The influence of inorganics is not included in the scheme. Min-
erals can affect the char yield, as mentioned in Section 4.2, or
they can catalyse the fragmentation reactions during the pyrol-
ysis of cellulose and hemicellulose, as commented in Sections
3.1.1 and 3.2, respectively. The release of inorganics or nitroge-
nous compounds is not described.

3. Interactions between biomass components are not considered,
which can influence mass loss [213] and product composition
[71,271].

4. The presented schemes for each component do not completely
reflect the entire mechanism of biomass pyrolysis. More de-
tailed schemes would be required for a precise description. For
example, phenolic oligomers released from lignin are not
considered.

5. Xylan is employed as representative for hemicellulose. However,
as stated in Section 2.1, xylan may be a good representative of
hemicellulose of hardwoods, but its use leads to inaccuracies for
softwoods [153]. Moreover, extractives are not considered in the
scheme.

The first limitation was partially dealt in Anca-Couce et al. [267]
through an adaptation of the Ranzi scheme. Secondary charring re-
actions were introduced in the RAC scheme (Ranzi et al.
[152] + Anca-Couce et al. [267], see Fig. 19). In these reactions, char
is produced together with H2O, CO2 and H2. These products were
suggested by Milosavljevic et al. [101] and Vinu and Broadbelt [130]
and their stoichiometry is based on the results of the micro-TGA
experiments of Jensen et al. [221] (see Section 4.2.1). Adjustable pa-
rameters “xi” represent the amount of the initial fragmentation
primary products – (Vol. + Char)1,1 in the case of cellulose – that react
to form the previously listed secondary products – (Vol. + Char)2,1
in this case. Char formation through reaction R4 is eliminated [121].
Furthermore, the influence of inorganics is partially considered.
During the competition between fragmentation and sugar forma-
tion reactions, the catalytic effect of alkali metals in biomass, together
with secondary reactions of volatiles in particles of a certain thick-
ness, leads to a preference of the fragmentation pathway over the
formation of sugar for both cellulose and hemicellulose in the
adapted scheme. Sugars are produced in very low quantities under
these conditions [45,174], not just because of the secondary dehy-
dration reactions of sugars inside the biomass particle, as stated by
Corbetta et al. [266], but also due to the presence of inorganics
(mainly AAEM), which strongly enhance the direct production of
LMWC. This last adaptation is not generally valid, but it is valid for
the aforementioned conditions. The adaptation significantly im-
proves the predictions of final product composition for wood
pyrolysis and torrefaction in a fixed bed (slow pyrolysis) with par-
ticle sizes of around 1 cm [153,267,272]. Values of the “xi”
parameters, which represent the amount of secondary charring re-
actions, in the range 0.3–0.4 and equal for all components are optimal
for these conditions. Lower values should be employed under con-
ditions where less secondary reactions take place, such as under
typical fluidised bed conditions. A value of 0.2 [153] was em-

ployed to describe the micro-TGA experiments at low heating rates
conducted by Gronli et al. [151]. The factors that influence the extent
of secondary charring reactions, and therefore the “xi” param-
eters, have been already discussed in detail in Section 4.3.1 and will
be here briefly stated:

• Temperature/heating rate: low temperatures/heating rates lead

to more charring.

• Retention time of the volatiles in the particles: higher reten-
tion times, obtained with higher particle sizes or lower gas flow
rates, lead to more charring.

• Pressure: higher pressures lead to more charring.
• Inorganics: ash constituents, especially AAEM, lead to more

charring.

Future work is still required to overcome the previously de-
scribed limitations. The amounts of secondary charring reactions
(“xi” in the RAC scheme) are expected to be different for each com-
ponent and depend on the pyrolysis conditions. In order to develop
a predictive model, the “xi” parameters for each component should
be calculated as a function of the temperature (based on compet-
itive reactions), retention time of the volatiles, pressure and content
and composition of inorganics. The competitions between sugar for-
mation and fragmentation is expected to be a function of the
concentration and the composition of inorganic species (mainly
AAEM), in accordance with the work of Trendewicz et al. [273]. More
detailed schemes are still required for both primary and second-
ary reactions. Recent advancements in the understanding of the
pyrolysis mechanisms of biomass macrocomponents have been re-
viewed in Section 3. Insights into secondary homogeneous tar
cracking reactions, included the formation of BTX/PAH, have been
obtained through the use of the detailed mechanism of Norinaga
et al. [107] for cellulose, and of Nowakowska et al. [173] for lignin
volatiles. Mellin et al. [274] have proposed a simpler mechanisms
to model these reactions from the products of the Ranzi scheme.
Despite the limitations of the Ranzi and RAC schemes, they signifi-
cantly surpass the commonly schemes appearing in the literature,
such as the competitive scheme. The use of detailed schemes, which
allows researchers to go into the fundamentals of pyrolysis in depth,
is recommended by this reviewer.

4.4. Heat of reaction

The heat of reaction during biomass pyrolysis remains a
matter of controversy, as has been pointed out recently by several
authors [275–277]. The heat of reaction in micro experiments is
usually determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
[178,211,278–281]. In these experiments, the sample holder and a
reference holder are kept at the same temperature with indepen-
dently controllable resistance heaters. The heat of reaction is
calculated from the difference in the electrical input going to each
holder [6]. Heat radiation effects should be considered during these
experiments and removed to calculate the heat of reaction of the
pyrolysis experiments, as explained by Rath et al. [278]. A typical
result for woody biomass (5 mg of spruce) is shown in Fig. 20 [278].
In the experiment, conducted without a lid, pyrolysis is globally en-
dothermic, except for a slight exothermicity exhibited at high
temperatures, and there is a good correlation between the mass loss
and heat of reaction curves (see also Fig. 11). The common belief
that biomass pyrolysis is an endothermic process may have arisen
from the results of these experiments.

However, as pointed out by many authors and as seen in Fig. 20,
when a lid is employed, the exothermicity of the reaction in-
creases, as well as the char yield [278–281]. The same effect is
observed when a higher initial sample mass is employed for the
experiment. The presence of the lid increases the retention time of

A. Anca-Couce/Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 53 (2016) 41–79

63

tion of the volatiles [87,218,278–281,285]. The general importance
of heterogeneous secondary reactions in wood pyrolysis has been
pointed out by Schinkel [218], who calculated kinetics for them. The
LIF of the volatiles from single particle experiments showed that
the production of PAH in charring reactions (see Fig. 8 for cellu-
lose and Fig. 10 for lignin) was correlated with a more exothermic
global heat of reaction [87]. With reference to Fig. 16, biomass py-
rolysis can be considered as a two-step process, with an initial
endothermic primary devolatilisation followed by exothermic sec-
ondary charring. When charring reactions are enhanced, a more
exothermic global heat of reaction is obtained. This occurs when
the residence time of the volatiles is increased, as in the previ-
ously mentioned experiments, but also when the biomass has higher
ash content [282] or experiments are conducted under higher pres-
sure conditions [286].

Values for the heat of reaction of charring that are available in
literature differ [277]. The global heat of reaction of pyrolysis is
almost a linear function of the char yield, so the heat of reaction
of charring can be calculated from the slope of that figure [277].
For cellulose, Mok and Antal reported a value of 3.6 kJ/g of char [102],
Milosavljievic et al. [100] of 2.0 kJ/g, and Cho et al. [287] of 5.1 kJ/g.
Rath et al. [278] reported values of 3.5 and 3.8 kJ/g for beech and
spruce respectively and Gómez et al. [279] a value of 0.9 kJ/g for
artichoke thistle. Experiments from Basile et al. [286] conducted with
corn stalks, poplar and switchgrass led to similar values as Mok and
Antal (3.6 kJ/g) [102]. Chen et al. [281] reported huge differences
among several biomasses, including a questionable low value for
cellulose (<0.3 kJ/g). Different values may also arise due to exper-
imental errors.

Heat of reaction in biomass pyrolysis can be explained using the
RAC scheme presented in Section 4.3. The heat of reaction is pre-
sented for different components and values of “x” in Fig. 22, which
determines the amount of secondary charring reactions. Values are
calculated as a difference of the net heating value of reactants and
products. The net calorific values of cellulose, hemicellulose and
lignin are calculated from the elemental composition of the model
according to the correlation of Gaur [288]. For hemicellulose, the
same value is assumed for “x5” and “x8”. It is clearly seen that en-
hancing charring results in a more exothermic process. A value of
0.2, employed for micro-TGA experiments, leads to a more endo-
thermic process. A similar value would be valid for fast pyrolysis
processes, endothermic and with low charring [30]. A value in the
range 0.3–0.4, employed for pyrolysis in a fixed bed with particles
in the cm range, leads to some exothermicity, as observed in the
experiment illustrated in Fig. 21. In the case of cellulose, the slope
of the figure leads to a heat of reaction for charring equal to 3.6 kJ/g
of char, in the range of values reported in the literature. Considering
that less charring occurs for cellulose than for hemicellulose and

lid at 10 K/min with 5 mg of spruce (adapted from Rath et al. [278]).

the volatiles in the sample and, therefore, the extent of charring re-
actions. This exothermic behaviour has been also observed in single
particle or reactor experiments [87,277,282]. Three different zones
can be observed: an initial exothermic peak, which is mainly linked
to hemicellulose, followed by an endothermic peak linked to cel-
lulose and, afterwards, an exothermic peak that is linked to lignin.
The remarkable exothermicity of the last stage of pyrolysis can be
clearly observed in single particle experiments, such as the ones con-
ducted by Park et al. [283] and shown in Fig. 21.

Different interpretations are available in the literature for the exo-
thermicity of biomass pyrolysis. Haseli et al. [276] noted that the
heat of reaction is dependent on temperature, and it becomes more
exothermic at higher temperatures. The same group [284] later stated
that the exo-/endothermic nature of pyrolysis cannot be com-
pletely reflected by this temperature dependence. Park et al. [283]
tried to model the single particle experiment of Fig. 21 using the
competitive scheme illustrated in Fig. 17, but including a solid in-
termediate instead of char. This intermediate product would then
produce char exothermally during primary pyrolysis. Secondary re-
actions were ruled out as a cause for exothermicity because when
employing (homogeneous) tar cracking kinetics from the litera-
ture, these secondary reactions would not have taken place. The
experiment is run at 415 °C, which is lower than the 500 °C that
would be required (see Section 4.2). However, this argument was
not correct, because it arrives from the confusion made between
secondary cracking reactions with secondary charring reactions. A
through literature review indicates that exothermicity is linked
with the heterogeneous secondary reactions of volatiles that lead
to generation of (secondary) char, as well as affect the composi-

iment of a wood sphere (25 mm diameter) at 415 °C (adapted from Park et al. [283]).

lignin, the RAC scheme can also predict the different behaviour of
the components, with cellulose being the most endothermic. It has
clearly been shown that a scheme that includes exothermic sec-
ondary charring, such as the RAC scheme, is required in order to
describe the different heats of reactions experimentally observed
in pyrolysis.

4.5. Other processes

Two special cases of pyrolysis will now be reviewed in more

detail: oxidative pyrolysis and torrefaction.

4.5.1. Oxidative pyrolysis

Pyrolysis is not always conducted in an atmosphere that lacks
an oxidising agent. Practical examples of oxidative pyrolysis are
smouldering or pyrolysis in an oxidative medium as a sub-process
of gasification. Smouldering is a slow, low temperature, flameless
form of combustion, sustained by the heat that evolves when oxygen
is directly in contact with the surface of a fuel, as in the case of char-
coal grills or cigarettes, for example Ref. 289. Smouldering is a critical
matter in the cases of wildfires, fuel accumulations and fire safety
of building and aerospace environments. Controlled smouldering
can also have beneficial effects, because it can produce biochar at
practically no energy costs [290]. Oxidative pyrolysis is usually se-
lected as the first step in the two stage gasification process, because
this first process is autothermal [174]. Moreover, when the air intake
is at the top in downdraft gasification, oxidative pyrolysis occurs
in this region [291].

In oxidative pyrolysis, as reviewed by Di Blasi [292], the peak
of the mass loss rate is shifted to lower temperatures than for py-
rolysis due to the presence of oxygen. In an atmosphere of air the
maximum reaction rate at low heating rates (around 5 K/min) is
about 1.5 times higher than for pyrolysis, and is produced at a tem-
perature 30–50 °C lower for pine wood and other woody biomass
species. The hemicellulose shoulder is less clear than in pyrolysis
due to an overlap of the cellulose and hemicellulose peaks, pro-
ducing a higher maximum reaction rate [178,293–295]. Moreover,
oxidative pyrolysis is followed by char combustion when oxygen
in present.

The kinetic scheme that is frequently employed to describe
smouldering is the three-step chemical reaction scheme of a poly-
meric fuel that was proposed by Ohlemiller [289]. The mechanism
includes fuel pyrolysis, fuel oxidation and char oxidation, account-
ing for three solid species or components (fuel, char and ash) as
shown:

The distinction between fuel pyrolysis and oxidation is rele-
vant because their heats of reaction are extremely different; fuel
oxidation is clearly exothermic. Oxidative degradation is predom-
inant in cellulose experiments in air at 190 °C, but pyrolysis
dominates [91] above 300 °C. The differences in the activation en-
ergies are expected to reflect this behaviour; the activation energy
of cellulose pyrolysis is higher than that of cellulose oxidation [113].
The same behaviour is observed for the different components of lig-
nocellulosic biomass [178].

The kinetics of oxidative pyrolysis of different types of lignocel-
lulosic biomass are available in the literature [293,295–300]. The
kinetics that distinguish between fuel pyrolysis and oxidation fol-
lowing the Ohlemiller scheme are more rare. They are available for
paper (cellulose) [113], polyurethane foam [301] and pine wood

[178]. In the case of polyurethane foam and pine wood, several
pseudo-components – 2 and 3, respectively – have been em-
ployed to gain a more precise description of the fuel, as is required
for pyrolysis.

It is also important to point out that oxidative pyrolysis may occur
at low concentrations of oxygen because of the depletion of the
oxygen content inside the bed [289,302,303] or the low ambient
oxygen concentration [304]. It is, therefore, important to measure
oxidative pyrolysis at different, low oxygen concentration levels.
Studies that have dealt with this issue are available for cellulose paper
[113,305], tobacco [296] (with the DAEM), residues from olive oil
processing [297], pine wood [178,293,300] and rice straw [298].

The presence of oxygen during pyrolysis not only affects the re-
action kinetics, but also the product composition. In oxidative
pyrolysis the yields of CO2, CO and H2O are higher than in pyroly-
sis, while the yield of organic compounds is reduced [113,174,306].
The yield of char is, however, nearly unaffected, and the obtained
char has the same oxidation reactivity as the one produced through
pure pyrolysis experiments [178].

4.5.2. Torrefaction

Torrefaction is a mild pyrolysis process that occurs at tempera-
tures that are usually in the range of 220–350 °C. In this process,
mainly the hemicellulose fraction decomposes. Biomass loses mass
and becomes enriched in carbon due to the release of volatiles. Ad-
ditionally, torrefaction improves grindability, prolongs durability,
increases hydrophobicity and reduces the chance of biological and
thermal degradation, which is favourable for storage and transpor-
tation. Due to these benefits, interest in torrefaction has grown in
recent years. The process of torrefaction and its applications were
reviewed by van der Stelt et al. [307] and Tumuluru et al. [308].

The kinetics of torrefaction are usually modelled using a two-
step kinetic scheme, with the competition between the formation
of volatiles and solid products shown at each step [309–311]. This
approach has been inspired by the work with hemicellulose re-
viewed in Section 3.2. The composition of the volatiles for each
reaction was calculated by Bates and Ghoniem [312] for a hard-
wood species (willow), based on the kinetics [309] and analysis of
products [313] from Prins et al. The main limitations of these
schemes are that they cannot be generally employed for lignocel-
lulosic biomass, but only for the species for which kinetics and
product composition were initially calculated. Additionally, the points
of critic about competitive schemes stated in Section 4.3.1 also apply
here.

Biomass pyrolysis schemes, based on the sum of the contribu-
tions of the biomass components, are also employed to describe
torrefaction [314–316]. A kinetic scheme that is able to predict
biomass pyrolysis is also expected to be able to predict biomass tor-
refaction, because torrefaction is only a partial pyrolysis process.
The detailed schemes presented in Section 4.3.3 are well-suited to
describing biomass torrefaction. Corbetta et al. [266] have shown
that the Ranzi scheme is able to predict the mass loss evolution of
cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin under torrefaction conditions.
Anca-Couce et al. [153,272] have shown that the RAC scheme can
correctly predict mass loss evolution and product composition of
hardwood and softwood species during torrefaction. The main limi-
tations of the scheme are that reactive drying is not included [308],
leading to an under-prediction of the water vapour yield, and that
xylan is considered a representative of softwood, which leads to some
inaccuracies for spruce (softwood). Moreover, interactions among
the macrocomponents are not considered [316], but this does not
significantly limit the capacities of this detailed scheme.

It has been shown in typical micro-TGA experiments at low
heating rates that the pyrolysis and oxidation reactivity of the re-
maining cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin fractions and the
produced char in torrefied wood are very similar to those of the

original biomass source [242,317]. Char produced at high heating
rates from torrefied wood, however, has a lower reactivity than char
produced under the same conditions from the original wood [318].
Char produced at high heating rates is known to have a higher re-
activity [58,59]. The lower reactivity of char produced after
torrefaction may be explained due to in this initial process, during
which some char (cross-linking) is already produced [319,320], which
is actually a low heating rate char, with a lower reactivity than that
produced at high heating rates.

The main volatile products are H2O, CO2 and, for hardwoods, acetic
acid produced from hemicellulose [153,309,321]. Mass loss from
hardwoods at a certain temperature is higher than from soft-
woods [153,313]. Other permanent gases, such as CO, and
condensable species, such as formaldehyde, methanol or lactic acid
are produced. Heavy condensable species, which can be mea-
sured using a gravimetric method, are also produced in significant
amounts [153,320] but are often disregarded.

Exothermic behaviour has been reported in single particle ex-
periments with wood [314]. Exothermicity is associated with
hemicellulose decomposition and can lead to temperature run-
aways in these experiments [322]. In the two-step kinetic scheme,
the first step is associated with hemicellulose and is exothermic.
The second step, mainly associated with cellulose and lignin, can
be either endothermic or exothermic [275]. This is in accordance
with the predictions from the RAC scheme shown in Fig. 22. Values
of the “x” parameter ranging from 0.3 to 0.4, representative of typical
torrefaction conditions (see Section 4.4), lead to exothermic hemi-
cellulose decomposition.

5. Multi-scale pyrolysis

Modelling thermo-chemical processes of biomass should be con-
sidered a multi-scale problem. Multi-scale modelling is a multi-

disciplinary attempt to merge models with different time and length
scales in order to describe the processes from first principles. In
chemical engineering, the different scales range from atomic to the
plant level. At the atomic level quantum chemistry can provide re-
action rate constants, activations energies, heat of adsorption or heat
capacities. That information is the input at the molecular level, con-
sisting of chemical reactions and surface processes. At the particle
level, transport phenomena should be taken into account and com-
bined with the kinetics of the molecular level. The particle level is
usually solved with the Thiele modulus approach. At the reactor level,
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) are employed to describe the
mass, momentum and energy transport. The aim of multi-scale mod-
elling is to combine all these levels to describe chemical processes
[323].

The same approach should be employed when pyrolysis of
biomass is modelled. The first principles of quantum chemistry were
applied to develop a molecular mechanism for pure cellulose py-
rolysis, as explained in Section 3.1.4, but this work has not yet been
extended to lignocellulosic biomass. The available molecular mecha-
nisms in the literature have been reviewed in Section 4.3. At the
particle level, which will be described in Section 5.1, transport phe-
nomena should be taken into account along with the reaction
schemes derived from the molecular level and changes in the solid
structure. At the reactor level, which will be described in Section
5.2, the single biomass particles should be considered together with
the interstitial gas phase. The molecular, particle and reactor levels,
shown in Fig. 23, should be considered together in models. When
describing pyrolysis of biomass, the particle level is often not con-
sidered and apparent kinetics, thus, are directly introduced in reactor
models. It has been emphasised that, instead of global kinetics, in-
trinsic reaction kinetics – the molecular level – should be applied
to describe a process [324]. Without reliable kinetics, the reactor
design is rather speculative, and it is not really possible to predict

66

A. Anca-Couce/Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 53 (2016) 41–79

the dynamic behaviour of a reactor. This means that more sophis-
ticated models are required, which are based on chemico-physical
processes rather than on empirical correlations. Only a model in-
corporating different spatial scales will be able to describe thermo-
chemical processes of biomass with adequate accuracy.

5.1. Particle level

Many models for the pyrolysis of a single biomass particle are avail-
able in the literature and a comprehensive review has been provided
by Di Blasi [37]. Earlier comprehensive reviews are also available [6,244].
At the particle level, the following phenomena are coupled:

• Chemical reactions: primary and secondary pyrolysis, plus drying

if the particle is initially wet.

• Transport of energy.
• Transport of mass and momentum.
• Change in the physical structure of the particle.

The main dimensional numbers that govern pyrolysis of a single
particle will first be analysed and then the previous phenomena will
be described one by one, to complete the section with a discus-
sion of relevant single particle experiments and models.

5.1.1. Non dimensional numbers

A dimensional analysis of the pyrolysis of a single particle, con-
sidering primary pyrolysis kinetics and transport of energy, reveals
that two dimensionless numbers describe the main controlling
factors [325,326]: the thermal Biot number and the pyrolysis number,
which is also called inverse of the thermal Thiele modulus. The di-
mensionless numbers will be described for a spherical particle of
radius R, thermal conductivity λ and heat capacity cp, with (cid:2)r
representing the reaction rate of pyrolysis and α the external heat
transfer coefficient. The thermal Biot number – Eq. (5) – shows the
importance of internal temperature gradients. For a large Bi number,
internal heat transfer is slow as compared to external heat trans-
fer, and internal temperature gradients are significant. The pyrolysis
number is the ratio of the characteristic times of reaction and heat
transport. Two different pyrolysis numbers are defined, which refer
to internal heat penetration in the particle – Py defined in Eq. (6)
– and to external heat transport to the particle – Py′ defined in Eq.
(7). If the pyrolysis numbers are high, the reaction proceeds slowly
as compared to the internal or external transport of energy.

These non-dimensional numbers are plotted in Fig. 24 for dif-
ferent particle sizes and typical biomass properties. Two different
heat transfer coefficients are considered, 50 and 400 W/(m2*K), which
are typical for fixed and fluidised bed conditions, respectively [244].
Two different temperatures are considered, 600 K (323 °C) and 800 K
(523 °C). Although higher pyrolysis temperatures are sometimes
claimed in experiments, it is questionable whether significant py-
rolysis not takes place during heating of the particle, as discussed
in Section 3.1.2. For each particle size, only the lower value between
Py or Py′ is represented. Therefore, only the mode that dominates
is depicted in the figure, either internal (Py) or external (Py′) heat
transport.

cle with λ = 0.2 W/(m*K), cp = 2 kJ/(kg*K), ρ = 500 kg/m3 and kinetics of primary
pyrolysis from Chan et al. [245].

Four different regimens can be defined based on the non-

dimensional numbers [37,132,140,325,327]:

• Pure kinetic regime: with low Bi and high Py′ numbers, whereby
the chemical reactions are slower than heat transfer, and, there-
fore, a purely kinetic regime at a constant temperature is achieved.
• Thermally thin regime: with low Bi and low Py′ numbers,
whereby the internal heat transfer in the particle and chemical
reactions are faster than the external heat transfer to the par-
ticle, and, therefore, external heat transfer controls the process,
but no intra-particle gradients are present.

• Thermal wave regime: with high Bi and low Py numbers, whereby
the internal heat transfer is much slower than the external heat
transfer and chemical reactions, and, therefore, internal heat
transfer controls the process.

• Thermally thick regime: with high Bi and high Py numbers,
whereby both internal heat transfer and chemical reactions
control the process.

With a small particle size, a low Bi number is obtained and, there-
fore, no intra-particle gradients are present. To measure pyrolysis
kinetics accurately, without temperature variations along the radius
of the particle, micro experiments are conducted. Particle sizes lower
than 1 mm are required because of the low thermal conductivity
of the solid biomass. A small particle size is a necessary but not suf-
ficient condition to be included in a pure kinetic regime; a high
pyrolysis number is also required to achieve this regime. This would
generally happen if pyrolysis kinetics are measured at low tem-
peratures (around 600 K) or heating rates, as in typical micro-TGA
experiments like the one for which results are shown in Fig. 11, con-
ducted at a heating rate of 10 K/min. If the researchers want to
measure kinetics at high temperatures, two main difficulties are
faced. First, as pointed out in Section 3.1.2, high temperatures cannot
be achieved without significant decomposition throughout the low-
temperature region. Second, a thermally thin non kinetic regime will
most probably partially or entirely apply, rather than a purely kinetic
regime, and the external heat transfer to the particle will control
the process and the temperature of the sample cannot be mea-
sured, but only estimated based on calculations. Therefore, obtaining
kinetics at high heating rates/temperatures is extremely challeng-
ing, and experiments in a pure kinetic regime, such as those
discussed in Section 4.1, are usually recommended.

For larger particle sizes, particle models are required to model
the temperature gradients that will be present inside the particle.
A detailed volumetric model, that allows the calculation of tem-
peratures and reaction rates throughout the particle, is required for

the thermally thick regime and zones between regimes. A partic-
ularly relevant case is the application of the unreacted shrinking
core model, where the char region is separated from the virgin wood
by an infinitely thin surface front where pyrolysis takes place. This
model is valid for the thermal wave regime. The Biot number and
inverse of the pyrolysis number should be higher than (100,100)
[326] or (40,1400) [325] in order to apply it without significant error.
Lower values can be employed with an acceptable error margin.
Fig. 24 illustrates that particles in the centimetre range and subject
to high temperatures are required in order to correctly employ this
shrinking core model.

5.1.2. Chemical reactions and drying

The competitive scheme, described in Section 4.3.1, is the most
commonly employed to describe pyrolysis in single particle volu-
metric models [6,244,245,251,283,328–331]. Tar cracking is
commonly described with homogeneous kinetics, such as the one
of Liden et al. [249], applied in Refs. 251, 283, and 328–332. The
application of the competitive scheme, in combination with the
transport of heat in the particle, allows an accurate description of
the mass loss evolution over time in single particle experiments.
Points of critique for this scheme have already been presented
(Section 4.3.1): a non-detailed product composition is predicted by
the model and not all relevant parameters in charring are consid-
ered, such as particle size, pressure or ash content.

The detailed Ranzi scheme presented in Section 4.3.3 was applied
by Corbetta et al. [266,333] and by Bennadji et al. [334] in a par-
ticle model, providing promising results for both mass loss evolution
and the detailed product composition. However, Bennadji et al. [334]
have noted that the model could not be used to detect the differ-
ences in product composition among particles of different sizes,
because the secondary reactions of the volatiles were not consid-
ered. Neither the available model for secondary gas phase reactions
[335] nor the secondary charring reactions (which may be more rel-
evant due to the low temperatures, less than 500 °C) were considered
in that work [334].

Pyrolysis has been described as a two-stage process in Fig. 16,
but particle models applied until now have not generally included
secondary charring or, in general, heterogeneous charring/cracking
reactions of the volatiles, due lack of information. Available kinet-
ics for these reactions are very limited [218]. Exceptions to this rule
are provided in the papers of Ahuja et al. [336] and Sadhukhan et al.
[337], where heterogeneous tar cracking/charring are considered
in particle models and applied to temperatures in the range 300–
600 °C. They included a deposition coefficient, which depended on
the volatile contact time inside the pyrolysing particle. The kinet-
ics and coefficients of the secondary reactions were fitted to
reproduce single particle results, resulting into estimated activa-
tion energy of this reaction of around 80 and 90 kJ/mol, respectively.
A low activation energy was predicted by Milosavljevic et al. [101],
as obtained in the previous works. A different approach was pro-
posed by Grieco and Baldi [338], that considered reactions for cross-
linking and obtained very high activation energies for them.

On the other hand, homogeneous tar cracking kinetics that are
commonly employed in competitive schemes predict that tar crack-
ing is not relevant for temperatures lower than 500 °C, as stated in
Section 4.2. This has led some authors to the conclusion that no sec-
ondary tar reactions take place inside the particle at lower
temperatures [283], which is not actually true [87,218]. Heteroge-
neous secondary reactions take place at lower temperatures, and
involve charring to some extent.

It can be concluded that mass loss can be correctly described,
and that advancements have been made in the description of product
composition with detailed schemes, but that a more detailed
description of secondary processes inside the particle has yet to be
made.

5.1.2.1. Drying. A biomass particle is not commonly initially dried
when it is pyrolysed. The forms of moisture in a biomass particle
were reviewed in Section 2.1. The evaporation of moisture must be
included in a detailed model together with pyrolysis and can be cal-
culated in three different ways:

• Equilibrium method: assumes that liquid and bound water are
in equilibrium with water vapour in the pores. This assump-
tion is typical in models of low-temperature drying, however,
several authors have applied it for high-temperature drying
[6,253,339,340]. In order to implement this model, a detailed de-
scription of mass and energy transport inside the particle is
required [341]. Special care should be taken to select the ap-
propriate properties and transport coefficients [342].

• Heterogeneous reaction: a first-order Arrhenius equation has been
proposed by Chan et al. [245] to calculate the evaporation rate
in woody biomass. It has been employed in several papers due
to its simple introduction in models [329,331,343,344]. Its primary
disadvantage is that differing physical phenomena are lumped
together into a single expression. Comparisons between exper-
imental and calculated data have shown that the pseudokinetic
data must be adapted to the given boundary conditions, which
excludes this model from general use [345].

• Heat sink method: assumes that evaporation occurs at a fixed
boiling temperature over an infinitely thin moving surface. When
a surface reaches this temperature, the energy received on this
surface is only consumed in evaporation until the water has been
completely released. Therefore, evaporation plays the role of a
heat sink during drying. This model, which actually resembles
the shrinking particle model previously described, is not valid
when the thickness of the drying zone is not negligible as com-
pared to the thickness of the material. Therefore, it can only be
employed for high temperature drying for particles that are not
small. A disadvantage is that a step function is created, which
could cause problems with numerical stability [346].

It is worth noting that some authors have used a combination
of these different methods [329,331]. The heterogeneous reaction
model should not be directly employed for conditions different from
the ones for which the pseudokinetic data were obtained [347]. Gen-
erally, the equilibrium method is more appropriate for low
temperature drying and the heat sink method for high tempera-
ture drying, although the limits of each region are not clearly defined.

5.1.3. Transport of mass and energy

Most of the developed models described in the literature are one-
dimensional in space [37]. Due to the anisotropic nature of biomass,
a two-dimensional model is required for a precise description of
temperature and pressure fields in the particle [348]. On average,
conversion is faster in two-dimensional models [37,244]. However,
for engineering purposes one-dimensional models provide a good
prediction of conversion time when the particle shape is consid-
ered [349] or a correction factor is introduced in one-dimensional
models [244].

Heat transfer occurs by conduction, convection and radiation. The
modes of energy transfer have been described by Gronli [6,350], who
also reviewed the biomass properties and transport coefficients avail-
able in the literature. Due to the large Peclet number for heat transfer
[351], a local thermal equilibrium between the solid and the gas
phase is usually assumed. Heat conduction is the most relevant mode
of heat transfer. The thermal conductivity λ plays actually a role in
the Bi and Py numbers. The thermal conductivity varies in the per-
pendicular and parallel directions to the fibre, and, therefore, an
effective thermal conductivity needs to be defined in one-
dimensional models, which can also include the effects of radiation
[6,346]. The relevance of heat convection, i.e., advection, was reflected

upon by Janse et al. [330], who have shown the cooling effect of the
volatiles when leaving the particle. This effect will, however, not occur
when the direction of gas flow is perpendicular to the heat flux di-
rection. The external heat transfer coefficient α, present in the Py′
number, also plays a relevant role. The values obtained for this co-
efficient with different technologies have been reviewed by Di Blasi
[37]. Heat transfer has generally been well described by volumet-
ric models, and the accurate description of heat transfer combined
with primary pyrolysis kinetics has led to good predictions for the
total conversion time and intra-particle temperatures.

On the other hand, not so much attention has been devoted to
intra-particle mass transfer. An accurate description of mass trans-
fer does not have a significant influence on the total conversion time
[6,244] because the volatiles are rapidly released from the parti-
cle. An exception to this statement is the case in which an
equilibrium model is employed to describe moisture evaporation.
Many pyrolysis models actually employ the hypothesis of imme-
diate outflow of volatiles [346,352,353]. Mass transfer is relevant
in order to describe the secondary reactions that can take place inside
the particle, which affect mainly the product composition [6,244].
As stated in Section 5.1.2, current models include tar cracking re-
actions with homogeneous kinetics, but charring/heterogeneous
reactions have almost never been described. The pressure field inside
the biomass particle can be estimated, although the presence of
cracks in char and the high uncertainty in permeability have led to
some inaccurate estimations [348,354].

Transport of mass occurs by convection and diffusion. Convec-
tion in pyrolysis is usually modelled using Darcy’s law, which is valid
when the viscous resistance force due to the momentum transfer
at the solid–fluid interface is much larger than both the inertial force
and the viscous resistance to the flow inside the fluid [355]. Spe-
cifically, this situation occurs when the Reynolds number – based
on permeability – is much lower than 10 [351], as it is for biomass
pyrolysis. Applying the full form of the momentum equation for a
low Mach number, derived theoretically, leads to similar results as
the application of Darcy’s law [332]. Therefore, Darcy’s law is usually
applied for simplicity. Molecular diffusion can be described using
a multicomponent Fickian diffusion or the dusty gas model (DGM).
In pyrolysis Fick’s Law is usually applied. The DGM has also been
employed [262,330], but has not led to noticeably different results
as Fick’s Law [262]. Knudsen diffusion could also be included,
however, it is usually neglected due to the typical biomass pore size
(10 μm) [245].

The estimation of the characteristic times for diffusion and con-
vection in porous particles have shown that convection is many
orders of magnitude faster than diffusion in pyrolysis [245], and,
therefore, diffusion can be neglected. The same conclusion is ob-
tained by evaluating the Peclet number for mass transfer, which is
much higher than 1 [356]. However, this does not hold for drying
and low temperature pyrolysis [6]. The typically characteristic times
for the different phenomena in a single particle under typical fixed
bed and fluidised bed conditions are shown in Table 4, being ρ
density, μ viscosity, κ permeability, p pressure, H length of the control
volume, vmax maximum velocity, D diffusivity and the subscripts g
and s show that the magnitude pertains to gas or solid phase, re-
spectively [357]. They have been derived considering Darcy’s law

for convection. These characteristic times show the time scale over
which each phenomenon takes place. Darcy convection refers to con-
vection that is due to pressure variations, which arise from the
pressure equation that is obtained by combining the equation of
state, Darcy’s law and continuity for the gas phase. The character-
istic time of Courant convection arises solely from the continuity
equation, when the velocity is already known. Despite the huge vari-
ability in permeability values [6,358], the characteristic time of
(Darcy) convection is many orders of magnitude lower than the one
for diffusion. Both phenomena are significantly faster than reac-
tion and conduction. These two slow phenomena control the total
conversion time and, therefore, the non-dimensional numbers pre-
sented in Section 5.1.1 are based on them, together with external
heat transfer.

5.1.4. Physical structure

During pyrolysis, a change in the physical structure of a biomass
particle occurs. Shrinkage of the structure takes place and possi-
bly cracking that can lead to swelling. Shrinkage is lower in the
longitudinal direction of the fibres, attributed to cellulose, than in
the radial and tangential directions, attributed to hemicellulose and
lignin [359]. Changes in the physical structure also occur, al-
though on a lower extent, during drying [341].

Shrinkage is described in some particle models. Mainly two usual
ways to describe it exist: the three-parameter model, presented by
Di Blasi [251], and the one-parameter model, presented by Hagge
and Bryden [328]. The first one fits the three parameters of the model
to reproduce the experimental results providing flexibility. However,
no experimental values are available for these parameters, and it
is not clear that the described changes in solid volume, volatile
volume and wood porosity are independent from one another, as
assumed in this model. The simpler one-parameter model assumes
that the intrinsic densities of the original biomass and char are con-
stant, and shrinkage is modelled as a linear function of conversion,
allowing the determination of the porosity theoretically, even though
it has been experimentally shown that shrinkage actually starts later
than mass loss during pyrolysis [360,361]. More complex and ac-
curate models that are based on elasticity theory, stress and
deformation are not available, despite some advances in the field
[362,363]. Models which relate shrinkage to the extent of char-
ring or models which describe the evolution of the internal surface
area of the solid material, described in Section 2.2.1, are neither avail-
able. The description of shrinkage in models is relevant for the
thermal wave regime, with high particle sizes and temperatures,
but not so relevant in other cases [328]. Char fragmentation, which
can be produced during subsequent char oxidation and gasifica-
tion reactions, is in contrast a crucial phenomenon to correctly
describe char reactions after pyrolysis [364].

5.1.5. Results

Typical changes in temperatures and mass loss for a single par-
ticle are shown in Fig. 21. Due to the high Biot number in the
experiment of Park et al. [283], where the particle diameter was
25 mm, intra-particle temperature gradients were present. There-
fore, mass loss is delayed in single particle experiments as compared
to pure kinetic experiments conducted at the same temperature
[365]. Single particle volumetric models can be used to describe the
previously reported or similar results, if a correct description of heat
transfer and primary pyrolysis kinetics, which can correctly de-
scribe the mass loss, are applied [6,245,283,284,349]. A detailed
sensitivity analysis, including comparison with experimental data,
has been conducted by Gronli [6] and it was concluded that the
thermal conductivity is of great importance for a correct modelling.
The shrinking core model can also simulate these experiments when
they take place in the thermal wave regime (see Section 5.1.1)

69

[366,367]. The experiments of Lu et al. [349] were correctly de-
scribed by both the volumetric detailed model [349] and by the
shrinking core model in Mehrabian et al. [367]. The latter model
is usually applied under combustion conditions, due to the front
reaction nature of the char oxidation reaction [346]. A combined
model, describing pyrolysis with a volumetric method and drying
and char oxidation with a shrinking core model, has been pro-
posed by He and Behrendt [302].

The reaction enthalpy of biomass pyrolysis is also required to
correctly describe these single particle experiments [330]. In many
studies, the reaction enthalpy has been considered to be constant,
as was mentioned by Bates and Ghoniem [275] and by Haseli et al.
[276]. With this approach, however, the differences in reaction en-
thalpy during conversion (see Section 4.4) cannot be described, which
has led, for example, to difficulties in modelling the exothermic peak
at the end of the experiments, shown in Fig. 21 and also shown in
other experiments [83,87]. As discussed in Section 4.4, this exo-
thermicity arises from heterogeneous secondary charring reactions;
therefore, a pyrolysis scheme should reflect these in order to cor-
rectly predict the temperature evolution inside the particle. Moreover,
accurate values for the thermal conductivity and specific heat are
required in order to correctly describe the temperature profiles, in-
cluding the final exothermic peak [266].

Pyrolysis products have been classified in char, tar and gas in most
of the literature studies at the particle level. The competitive scheme,
shown in Fig. 17, can predict both lower char yield and higher tar
yield at higher heating rates and the reduction of the tar yield at
high temperatures due to secondary tar cracking reactions [37]. As
mentioned in Section 2.2.2, the complete characterisation of volatiles
of biomass pyrolysis is challenging and the low mass of experi-
ments at the particle level complicates it. A description of the online
evolution of permanent gases has been provided in some studies
[365,368]. Moreover, Bennadji et al. described the evolution of some
light condensable species [83] and Gauthier et al. [369] characterised
to some extent the condensed species after the experiments. The
results of these two latter studies have been compared with the pre-
dictions of a particle model that includes the detailed Ranzi scheme
[266], and provided good results. The LIF technique was applied to
characterise the volatiles, focusing on PAH or formaldehyde and CO
[85,87,370,371]. In another study, the volatiles inside the particle
were sampled and the permanent gases were measured [372].
However, a complete characterisation of the volatiles in single par-
ticle experiments is not yet available.

The presence of moisture has a significant influence, because it
increases the total time of conversion. The effects of moisture content
on biomass pyrolysis were investigated by Di Blasi et al. [343]. Ex-
periments and modelling are also available for low temperature
pyrolysis (i.e., torrefaction) [314,315,373] and for oxidative pyrol-
ysis [293,374]. Exothermic behviour in the centre of the particle has
also been detected in torrefaction experiments, which can be at-
tributed in this case to the exotermicity of hemicellulose pyrolysis
[322] (see Section 4.4).

Finding the solution of a particle model involves solving a system
of differential and algebraic equations after spatial discretisation.
Standard methods such as the Crank–Nicolson [253,325,353], Runge–
Kutta [337] or backward differencing formulas (Gear method)
[6,244,352], when the problem is more stiff, can be used to solve
these partial differential equations. Specifically developed methods
for this purpose have also been presented [251]. Several authors have
devoted their attention to minimising the computational time re-
quired to solve a particle model, especially when it is coupled with
CFD reactor models. Methods have been proposed for the volumet-
ric model [357], based on the characteristic time of each phenomena,
the shrinking core model [375] or the particular situation in which
(at high temperatures) the shrinking core approach can be applied
to relatively small particles [376]. Empirical correlations have also

been developed for particular cases [37], however, care should be
taken when extrapolating them to different conditions.

5.2. Reactor level

At the reactor level, the single biomass particles should be con-
sidered together with the interstitial gas phase. The reactor level
should be coupled to the molecular and particle level in multi-
scale modelling. Different technologies are available and they are
usually classified as fast or slow pyrolysis [30,377]. In fast pyroly-
sis reactors, high heating rates are employed to maximise the
production of condensable species (liquids) and minimise the char
yield. As stated in Section 4.3, a rapid heating rate is not the only
condition that is required to maximise the liquid yield; a rapid
removal of primary pyrolysis products is also required to limit sec-
ondary charring reactions [377]. Other factors such as biomass
composition play a role. The analysis of the reactor level will be
divided into slow pyrolysis processes, Section 5.2.1, and fast pyrol-
ysis processes, Section 5.2.2, due to the significant differences
between them.

5.2.1. Slow pyrolysis

Slow pyrolysis processes that occur in kilns or retorts have long
been conducted with the objective to maximise the char yield
[61,378]. Slow heating rates, moderate temperatures and a long res-
idence time of the volatiles in the bed are key factors to maximise
this yield. There has recently been renewed interest in this tech-
nology for exploiting the properties of biochar [379]. Slow pyrolytic
processes are usually conducted in fixed/slow-moving beds, screw
reactors or rotatory kilns.

However, a lack of detailed experimental data exists in the lit-
erature for fixed beds of kilograms of material and particle sizes of
more than a few millimetres. Many pyrolysis experiments have been
reported, but usually for small samples. Schröder [380] made heat
transfer, drying and pyrolysis experiments with 10 mm beech wood
particles in a fixed bed of more than 20 cm height and diameter,
reported mass loss and temperatures in the bed. A detailed com-
position of the volatiles from pyrolysis with wood particles, including
condensable species, has been presented for fixed bed reactors in
the works of Branca et al. [78] and Milhe et al. [174] as well as, for
torrefaction, in Anca-Couce et al. [153]. Detailed composition data
have also been reported for screw pyrolysis in Tomasi-Morgano et al.
[381], including the composition at different points along the reactor.
The modes of heat and mass transfer in a fixed bed have been
well established [382,383]. Difficulties encountered when model-
ling a fixed bed of particles are the significant scattering of the
Nusselt number for low Reynolds numbers [384] and the possible
occurrence of channelling [385].

Most of the fixed bed/slow-moving pyrolysis models reported
in the literature are quasi-continuous, also referred to as Euler–
Euler models. In these models, the solid and gas phases are treated
as if they were continuous phases. Both phases are assumed to
coexist at every point of the spatial domain. Fixed-bed pyrolysis,
two-dimensional, quasi-continuous models that can be used to solve
mass, momentum and energy balances are available in the litera-
ture [386–389]. The momentum equation is often simplified by
applying Darcy’s law [386,388,389]. More simplified, fixed-bed, semi-
empirical models are also available [390]. A quasi-continuous model
has also been presented that can be employed to model pyrolysis
in a rotatory kiln [391]. The movement of the solid particles can be
modelled using the granular flow theory, as in rotatory kilns [392].
To model the slow movement of particles is, however, not straight-
forward, as shown by the difficulties encountered in modelling the
repose angle of a bed of particles [393]. Quasi-continuous models
are also usually employed when describing pyrolysis as a sub-
process to other thermo-chemical processes, as in combustion

70

(references in Refs. 394 and 395) or gasification [396]. These Euler–
Euler models are appropriate for thermally thin particles, since the
intra-particle gradients of temperatures and species concentra-
tions are negligible in this case. For these particles, Euler–Euler
models can provide a good description of mass loss and tempera-
tures in the bed.

To describe thermally thick particles (see 5.1.1), intra-particle
modelling is required. Wurzenbeger [397] reported that consider-
ing intra-particle gradients when modelling slow pyrolysis and drying
in a fixed-bed reactor lead to an extension of the drying and py-
rolysis fronts in the bed and fewer step temperature gradients in
the bed. The importance of intra-particle modelling in combus-
tion, including pyrolysis as a sub-process, was also shown
[394,398,399]. Di Blasi has stated that failing to include particle gra-
dients into reactor models can introduce severe inaccuracies into
the predictions of important design parameters of the reactor in
fixed-bed pyrolysis [37] and gasification [396].

Peters et al. [400,401] incorporated the particle level into a reactor
model of drying and pyrolysis, solving this multi-scale problem with
the Discrete Particle Model (DPM), which is also referred to as Dis-
crete Element Method or Euler–Lagrange model. The fluid phase is
considered as continuous in the DPM, but each particle is tracked
with a Lagrangian approach. Therefore, a model for each particle
in the bed is solved simultaneously with the fluid-phase balances
in the reactor domain. The size and the position of each particle have
to be determined at every time step. Peters and co-workers cor-
rectly simulated the experimental results of Schröder [380] with
the DPM employing a one-dimensional [400] and a three-
dimensional [401] model for the fluid phase. These experiments were
employed for model validation due to their detailed description of
the bed temperatures and mass loss. The DPM has also been applied
to fixed-bed combustion [394,399]. In all these studies, reactors of
lab-scale size have been considered.

The main disadvantage of incorporating a particle model into a
reactor model is the high amount of computational time needed
to reach the numerical solution of such a multi-scale model. This
is mainly due to the large number of particles that have to be con-
sidered. The Representative Particle Model (RPM) can reduce the
computational time with reference to model fixed-bed reactors. In
the RPM approach, an intra-particle model is solved for each finite
volume element in the reactor. It is assumed that all particles within
a finite volume element of the reactor (see Fig. 23) obey the same
characteristics as the one for which the intra-particle model is solved,
which is why it can be considered as representative. The advan-
tages of the RPM as compared to DPM are the significantly smaller
computational effort, making it possible to simulate bigger reactor
sizes, and the easier integration into existing computer codes for
simulation of fixed-bed reactors. RPM is a compromise between DPM
(Euler–Lagrange) and quasi-continuous models (Euler–Euler), which
considers in a feasible way intra-particle gradients. The RPM was
introduced by Wurzenberger to describe fixed-bed pyrolysis and
drying [397] and combustion [402], but without experimental val-
idation. In these papers, both the reactor and the particle domain
were discretised in one direction, in the axial direction in the reactor
and in the radial direction in the particle, which is why the model
was described as 1D+1D. The RPM was later applied by Anca-
Couce et al. [403] to describe the experimental results of Schröder
[380], showing that it is able predict them, and describing intra-
particle gradients.

The pyrolysis reaction in the previously mentioned models has
usually been described with competitive reaction schemes (see
Section 4.3.1) or simplified kinetic schemes. It is remarkable that
Yang et al. [387], applying the micro-kinetics from de Jong et al. [219],
reported an under-prediction of the char yield in the reactor
experiments. Detailed schemes (see Section 4.3.3) have not yet been
employed in comprehensive reactor models of slow pyrolysis, but

their potential to accurately predict product composition has already
been shown [267]. Moreover, the detailed Ranzi scheme has been
successfully employed to model pyrolysis in fixed bed gasification
[404] and combustion in a travelling grate [335]. As for the parti-
cle level (Section 5.1.5), exothermic behaviour was detected in fixed-
bed experiments that led to temperature runaways [277,282]. As
stated in Section 4.4, the enhancement of secondary reactions (such
as those that occurs in these reactors) leads to a more exothermic
behaviour. These temperature runaways have not yet been mod-
elled and a correct heat of reaction should be employed in models
to achieve it (see Section 4.4).

5.2.2. Fast pyrolysis

Fast pyrolysis processes are commonly conducted in bubbling
or circulating fluidised beds. Other technologies of relevance are ro-
tating cone pyrolysis and ablative pyrolysis [30]. These concepts are
based on a high heat transfer to the particles. In all of them, except
for ablative pyrolysis, low particle sizes are employed to rapidly gain
high temperatures throughout the particles, and to avoid second-
ary charring reactions. In ablative pyrolysis heat is transferred from
the reactor wall to one side of the particle by contact with pres-
sure, removing rapidly the volatiles that are generated. Other
innovative technologies such as microwave pyrolysis have also been
proposed [405]. The temperatures employed in all concepts are
usually around 500 °C. This temperature maximises the liquid yield,
while higher temperatures lead to tar cracking reactions and lower
temperatures to more charring.

Fluidised bed models should describe the gas, sand and biomass
phases. Gomez-Barea and Leckner [215] extensively reviewed
fluidised bed gasification. The fluidisation concepts described in that
review can also be applied for fluidised bed pyrolysis. Two possi-
ble ways to described the solid phases in a fluidised bed exist, as
for fixed-bed pyrolysis: an Eulerian and a Lagrangian approach.

Eulerian models treat the solid and gas phases as if they are con-
tinuous phases. The movement of the solid particles is modelled
using the granular theory. These quasi-continuous models have been
applied for bubbling [274,406–411] and circulating [412] fluidised
beds, although the closure between phases is not easy to solve in
these Eulerian models [413]. One-dimensional models [407,412] or
more complex models with more dimensions [274,406,410,411] have
been presented. It has been concluded that a two-dimensional sim-
ulation is suitable to describe fast pyrolysis in bubbling beds
[408,410].

In a Lagrangian model, each particle is tracked using a Lagran-
gian approach, increasing the required computational power. A
bubbling bed was simulated, considering the sand phase as Eulerian
and modelling a few reacting biomass particles [414,415]. A more
detailed model has been presented, employing the Lagrangian ap-
proach for the sand and biomass particles, which required the use
of a supercomputer [416]. Thermally thin particles were consid-
ered in both cases.

Models are also available for other fast pyrolysis technologies such
as rotating cone [417] and vortex reactors, with an Eulerian [418]
and a Lagrangian [419] approach for the biomass particles.

Intra-particle gradients were not considered in most of the cases.
However, intra-particle gradients can be significant in a fluidised
bed, as it has been experimentally shown [420]. A particle model
was applied by Di Blasi [421] and by Kersten et al. [244] that con-
sidered typical boundary conditions for these reactors. The particle
model developed by Miller and Bellan [252] was applied in a
fluidised bed [406] and a vortex [419] reactor model. Lathouwers
and Bellan [406] employed separate transport equations for each
particle class in the Eulerian model of a fluidised bed. Miller and
Bellan considered representative “test” particles in the vortex reactor
model [419]. They arrived at the conclusion that particles respond

only to time-averaged values of the flow properties and are not af-
fected by local temporal disturbances.

Detailed experimental data for fluidised bed reactors and other
fast pyrolysis technologies in the literature are limited [215], as it
is for slow pyrolysis. This is a difficulty faced during model valida-
tion. Moreover, most of the experimental data have been obtained
with lab-scale reactors [408,422]. Most of the previously pre-
sented models have employed simplified biomass kinetics, although
some works have already employed the detailed Ranzi scheme (see
Section 4.3.3) [274,412].

6. Conclusions

The reaction mechanisms and multi-scale modelling of ligno-
cellulosic biomass pyrolysis have been reviewed in this work. After
introducing the relevance of biomass pyrolysis and its products, the
individual reaction mechanism of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin
was described. The distinctive features of each one were shown, but
also attention was placed on the similarities among them: primary
pyrolysis involves an intermediate liquid compound, primary prod-
ucts may react further in secondary charring or cracking reactions
and the composition of the volatiles is significantly affected by the
presence of inorganics in biomass.

Pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass was then analysed, includ-
ing mass loss kinetics, product composition, reaction schemes, heat
of reaction and two particular processes: torrefaction and oxida-
tive pyrolysis. An emphasis was placed on the description of pyrolysis
as the sum of the contributions of the individual components and
the advantages of detailed reaction schemes. Finally, intra-particle
phenomena and particle models were analysed, as well as reactor
models, focusing on the main technologies: fluidised bed for fast
pyrolysis and fixed bed for slow pyrolysis. The need for a multi-
scale description of pyrolysis, including the molecular, particle and
reaction levels, was highlighted.

The word cloud for this work is presented in Fig. 25. It is not sur-
prising that words such as pyrolysis and biomass play a very relevant
role. A more detailed analysis shows the importance of the indi-
vidual components – cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin – and the
following recurrent concepts in the review: reaction schemes, models,
particle (level), secondary charring, heat of reaction or kinetics.

In summary, a list of 10 important research focal points for the
future is presented. An interesting list of future challenges has also
been proposed by Mettler et al. [423], which is focused on the fun-
damentals of pyrolysis for the production of biofuels, while the
proposed list in this work is more general. Research in these topics
would allow a more fundamental understanding of biomass pyrol-

ysis to be gained that would, in turn, allow the process to be
controlled in a more precise way and the development of more tar-
geted applications.

1. Quantum-mechanical calculations to determinate the precise
reaction mechanisms that take place in primary pyrolysis of
all biomass components.

2. Determination of the precise catalytic effects of the differ-

ent inorganics that can be present in biomass.

3. Influence of the intermediate liquid compound, phase changes

and changes in the physical structure.

4. Reactants, reaction pathways and products of secondary char-

ring reactions.

5. Detailed online characterisation applying different tech-
niques of the pyrolysis products from different biomass types
at different conditions.

6. Development and application of detailed reaction schemes
that can predict product composition at different conditions
based on the sum of the contributions of each component plus
the influence of inorganics and possible interactions.

7. Development of single particle models coupled with de-
tailed reaction schemes that can predict the extent of charring
that occurs in the particle together with heat and mass trans-
fer and changes in the physical structure.

8. Further development of multi-scale reactor models, includ-
ing the particle level and movement of solid particles, applied
to different technologies.

9. Detailed experimental characterisation of pyrolysis with dif-
ferent technologies, including real scale applications and
presenting product composition, parameters along the reactor
and boundary conditions.

10. Determination of possible harmful emissions such as
aerosols, PAH or compounds with N, Cl or S at different
conditions.
