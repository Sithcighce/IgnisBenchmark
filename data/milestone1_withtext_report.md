## üìã SAMPLE QUESTIONS (Fully Verified)


### Question 1 (Q2)

- **Type**: reasoning
- **Difficulty**: 4/5
- **Topic**: machine_learning
- **Citations**: 2 (all verified ‚úÖ)

**Question**:  
What are the key advantages of Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) over traditional ANNs for ICE modeling?

**Answer**:  
ELMs feature faster training speeds through random initialization of hidden layer parameters and analytical calculation of output weights via Moore-Penrose inversion, avoiding iterative optimization pitfalls like local minima.

**Original Text Citations**:
  1. [95.3% match] Extreme learning machine is a powerful and promising regression and classification approach with an extremely fast training speed compared to conventi...
  2. [95.1% match] Unlike the traditional ANNs, ELM analytically calculates the output weights by an inversion method called Moore-Penrose.

### Question 2 (Q3)

- **Type**: concept
- **Difficulty**: 5/5
- **Topic**: diagnostics
- **Citations**: 2 (all verified ‚úÖ)

**Question**:  
How does Gaussian Process regression differ from SVM in probabilistic predictions for combustion diagnostics?

**Answer**:  
GPs provide inherent probabilistic outputs through Bayesian inference on training data distributions, whereas SVMs require additional techniques to estimate prediction uncertainties since they only make point predictions.

**Original Text Citations**:
  1. [95.2% match] The Gaussian process is an effective method for Bayesian non-linear nonparametric classification and regression.
  2. [95.3% match] SVMs make point predictions rather than distribution (also called probabilistic) predictions.

### Question 3 (Q4)

- **Type**: calculation
- **Difficulty**: 3/5
- **Topic**: algorithm_complexity
- **Citations**: 1 (all verified ‚úÖ)

**Question**:  
Calculate the expected computational cost increase for Gaussian Processes when doubling the training data points from N to 2N.

**Answer**:  
Computational cost scales as O(n¬≥), so doubling N from N to 2N increases cost by (2N)¬≥/N¬≥ = 8 times. Storage scales as O(n¬≤), increasing by (2N)¬≤/N¬≤ = 4 times.

**Original Text Citations**:
  1. [92.1% match] The computational cost of GP increases by O(n¬≥) and its storage requirement increases by O(n¬≤) (where n is the number of points being interpolated).
