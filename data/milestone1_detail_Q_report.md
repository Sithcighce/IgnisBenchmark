### Question 2 ❌

**Question**: What are the key advantages of using extreme learning machines (ELMs) over traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs) for real-time combustion phasing control in HCCI engines?

**Answer Length**: 917 chars

**Verdict**: fail

**Checks**:
- Domain-focused: ✅ - The question specifically addresses the application of ELMs in HCCI engine combustion phasing contro
- Answer correct: ❌
- Citations verified: ✅ (2/2)

**Answer Issues**:
  - unsupported: The claim about OS-ELM variants updating models without retraining entire datasets is not supported by the provided citations.
  - unsupported: The specific performance metric (CA50 prediction errors <0.5°CA) is not mentioned in the citations.


### Question 3 ❌

**Question**: Derive the relationship between pressure rise rate (PRR) and ringing intensity (RI) in knocking combustion, considering both acoustic wave propagation and heat release effects.

**Answer Length**: 905 chars

**Verdict**: fail

**Checks**:
- Domain-focused: ✅ - The question requires deep knowledge of combustion dynamics, including pressure-wave energy formulat
- Answer correct: ❌
- Citations verified: ✅ (2/2)

**Answer Issues**:
  - unsupported: The answer provides a detailed derivation of RI and its relationship with PRR, but these details are not supported by the provided citations or original text excerpts, which only mention the complexity of predicting RI without giving specific equations or relationships.
  - factual_error: The answer assumes specific relationships (e.g., quadratic scaling of RI with PRR) that are not verified or mentioned in the provided citations or original text.


### Question 4 ❌

**Question**: How does the turbulence-chemistry interaction in RCCI combustion affect the spatial distribution of reactivity stratification, and what CFD modeling approaches best capture this phenomenon?

**Answer Length**: 1146 chars

**Verdict**: fail

**Checks**:
- Domain-focused: ✅ - The question requires deep understanding of combustion science (RCCI combustion, reactivity stratifi
- Answer correct: ❌
- Citations verified: ✅ (2/2)

**Answer Issues**:
  - unsupported: The answer provides detailed mechanisms (turbulent Schmidt number, Kolmogorov-scale eddies, Damköhler number) and modeling recommendations (transported PDF methods, LES) but lacks direct citations from the original text or paper excerpts to validate these claims.
  - too_brief: While the answer exceeds 300 characters, it lacks sufficient grounding in the provided citations or paper content to confirm factual accuracy.


### Question 5 ❌

**Question**: What are the limitations of using Gaussian Process (GP) regression for transient NOx prediction in diesel engines, and how do these limitations compare to ANN-based approaches?

**Answer Length**: 973 chars

**Verdict**: fail

**Checks**:
- Domain-focused: ✅ - The question requires understanding of combustion science (NOx prediction) and machine learning appl
- Answer correct: ❌
- Citations verified: ✅ (2/2)

**Answer Issues**:
  - unsupported: The answer claims GP regression struggles with discontinuous NOx spikes during load transients and that ANN handles discontinuities better, but these claims are not supported by the provided citations or paper excerpts.
  - unsupported: The answer states GP accuracy degrades sharply beyond ~20 inputs while deep ANNs can process 50+ parameters, but this comparison lacks citation support.
  - too_brief: The answer provides mathematical notation for GP predictive variance but does not sufficiently explain its relevance to NOx prediction in diesel engines.
