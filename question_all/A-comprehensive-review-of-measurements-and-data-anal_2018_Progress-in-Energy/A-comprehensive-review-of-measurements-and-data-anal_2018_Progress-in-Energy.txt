Accurate measurement and prediction of laminar burning velocity is important for characterization of premixed com-
bustion properties of a fuel, development and validation of new kinetic models, and calibration of turbulent combustion
models. Understanding the variation of laminar burning velocity with thermodynamic conditions is important from the
perspective of practical applications in industrial furnaces, gas turbine combustors and rocket engines as operating tem-
peratures and pressures are significantly higher than ambient conditions. With this perspective, a brief review of spher-
ical flame propagation method, counterflow/stagnation burner method, heat-flux method, annular stepwise method,
externally heated diverging channel method, and Bunsen method is presented. A direct comparison of power exponents
for temperature (a) and pressure (b) obtained from different experiments and derived from various kinetic mechanisms
is reported to provide an independent tool for detailed validation of kinetic schemes. Accurate prediction of laminar
burning velocities at higher temperatures and pressures for individual fuels will help in closer scrutiny of the existing
experimental data for various uncertainties due to inherent challenges in individual measurement techniques. Laminar
burning velocity data for hydrogen (H2), gaseous alkane fuels (methane, ethane, propane, n-butane, n-pentane), liquid
alkane fuels (n-heptane, isooctane, n-decane), alcohols (CH3OH, C2H5OH, n-propanol, n-butanol, n-pentanol) and di-
methyl ether (DME) are obtained from literature of last three decades for a wide range of pressures (1(cid:1)10 bar), temper-
atures (300(cid:1)700 K), equivalence ratios and mixture dilutions. The available experimental and numerical data for H2
and methane fuels compares well for various pressures and temperatures. However, more experimental and kinetic
model development studies are required for other fuels. Comparison of laminar burning velocity data obtained from dif-
ferent measurement techniques at higher initial pressures and temperatures showed significant deviations for all fuels.
This suggests to conduct focused measurements at elevated pressure and temperature conditions for different fuels to
enable the development of accurate kinetic models for wider range of mixtures and thermodynamic conditions.

1. Introduction

The combustion of fossil fuels contributes to around 80% of the
total energy production in today's world. This share of energy gener-
ation through combustion would continue to dominate in the com-
ing decades [1]. Pollutant emissions such as CO and NOx from
various combustion systems are a significant concern over environ-
mental protection and global warming. This has led to the develop-
ment of various techniques to improve the fuel economy, reduction
in pollutant emissions [2(cid:1)6], development of alternative and cleaner
combustion techniques through flame cooling [7], air staging [3,8,9],
reburning [10,11], lean premixed combustion [12(cid:1)14], exhaust gas
recirculation [15,16], high temperature air combustion [17,18] and
flameless combustion [19(cid:1)22]. However, detailed research and
understanding of combustion behavior is required before imple-
menting these techniques in practical combustion systems. A first
step toward this is to understand the laminar burning velocity
behavior of various fuel+oxidizer mixtures and characterize the
flame structure and ignition delays both experimentally and through
the modeling to improve our understanding in the field based on
detailed chemical kinetics [23(cid:1)26].

Laminar burning velocity (LBV) is a physicochemical property of a
premixed fuel + oxidizer mixture, resulting from the combined influ-
ence of the mixture diffusivity, mixture exothermicity and mixture
reactivity [26,27].
It provides a measure of overall reactivity of
fuel + air mixtures and helps in determining the rates of heat release,
testing and validation of detailed reaction mechanisms and simplified
kinetic models. Laminar burning velocity is a key parameter which
also helps describe various combustion phenomena such as flame
stabilization, flame flashback, flame blowout, and flame extinction
[26,28]. The laminar burning velocity as a parameter appears in the
modeling of various combustion phenomena, prediction of pollutants
formation through detailed mechanisms and accurate modeling of
the combustion of fuel + oxidizer mixture under practical conditions,
which occur in the combustion systems such as industrial furnaces,
IC engines, gas turbine combustors and rocket engines [2,3,24,26,29].
Laminar burning velocity, SLo, by definition, is the velocity of a steady
one-dimensional adiabatic free flame propagating in the doubly infi-
nite domain. This definition makes it suitable for calculations using
1-D computer codes using kinetic model, thermodynamic and trans-
port properties as input parameters and, therefore, convenient for
validation of kinetic schemes provided that thermodynamic and
transport parameters are well established.
It is, however, unfeasible
to perform experiments with planar flames in the doubly infinite
domain both from obvious practical and from fundamental points of
view. Planar flame propagation inside a confined space is affected by
non-quiescent unburned gas mixtures, because of thermal expansion
(Darrius-Landau instability), flame wall interactions, acoustic pres-
sure waves and buoyancy effects [30]. The Laminar burning velocity
is, therefore, not a measurable quantity; it is derived from other
observables using different assumptions or theoretical models.

Researchers have developed many techniques to measure the
laminar burning velocity of various fuel + air mixtures. In spherical
flame method [30], the fuel + air mixture ignited at the center using
a spark and flame propagation speed is determined either from pres-
sure-time history [31] or flame radius with time [32,33]. In stagna-
tion flame method [34], the minimum flow velocity near the
stabilized flame is considered as flame propagation velocity. The
measured flame propagation speeds from these methods are cor-
rected to flame stretch to derive laminar burning velocity [34,35].
Heat-flux method [36] helps direct measurement of laminar burning
velocity by stabilizing an adiabatic planar flame on the top of a per-
forated plate. Burner method [37(cid:1)39], annular stepwise diverging
tube [40] and diverging channel method [41] uses mass conservation
across the flame front to derive laminar burning velocity of pre-
mixed fuel + air mixtures.

Premixed flames were used in chemical laboratories as early as in
18th century [42], however, only in 1854 Bunsen proposed a design
suitable for stabilization of the flames of different composition and
their investigation. First measurements of the flame burning velocity
of hydrogen and carbon monoxide were performed by Bunsen in
1867 using eudiometer fitted with electrodes to ignite a mixture of
gas [43]. Subsequently, Mallard measured burning velocity of fire-
dump and lightning gases using the same method and proposed the
first flame propagation theory in 1875 [44], which was later devel-
oped by Mallard and Le Chatelier [45,46]. Mason and Wheeler [47]
also investigated flames propagating in tubes and discovered that
flame propagation speed depends on the tube diameter. Further
attempts to improve this method, notably by Coward and Hartwell
[48,49] demonstrated that flames propagating in tubes are not flat
and attempted to take the flame front surface into consideration to
derive average burning velocity. Gouy [50] implemented Bunsen
burner and suggested that in conical flames, the burning velocity
can be defined as volumetric rate of flow divided by the area of the
flames surface. When the flame shape is close to conical, this yields
sine angle based method. The same approach was later discussed by
Michelson [51], who contributed to the development of the theory
of Mallard and Le Chatelier. Hopkinson [52] reported first experi-
mental investigation of flame propagation in a confined chamber
with central ignition by electric spark. Flamm and Mache [53] were
first to propose a relation between pressure and the amount of mix-
ture burnt for spherical flames. Soap bubble method based on spher-
ical flames was proposed by Stevens [54] and further developed by
Fiock and Marvin [55]. Ellis and Wheeler [56] reported the first pho-
tograph of a spherical flame simultaneously with pressure measure-
ments. Lewis and von Elbe [30] proposed measurement of laminar
burning velocity, SL with constant volume spherical flame method
from time-pressure explosion records. In 1943, Lewis and von Elbe
[57], introduced particle imaging based technique to understand the
laminar burning velocity behavior within the burner stabilized
flames. Laminar burning velocity measurement using planar flame
front was proposed by Powling [58] . Linnet [59] analyzed all these

methods mentioned above and definitions of the burning velocity
specific for a particular method of measurements and concluded
that “it seems impossible to give a precise definition for burning
velocity which will be equally applicable to planar and spherical
flames”. Botha and Spalding [60] improved the Egerton-Powling
burner and proposed another method for flat flame stabilization and
burning velocity measurements. Later de Goey and co-workers
[61(cid:1)63] developed a heat-flux based approach to measure laminar
burning velocities for various fuel + air mixtures based on the ideas
of Botha and Spalding. Simmon and Wolfhard [64] reported the first
study of diffusion flames in stagnation flow configuration. The stag-
nation flow configuration was implemented for studying premixed
flames by Smith et al. [65]. They presented a theoretical analysis of a
stagnation flow system for premixed reactants along with experi-
mental studies on CO-oxidation system performed by Fang et al.
[66]. Law et al. [67] implemented the stagnation flow method to
determine lean extinction limits for propane + air mixtures experi-
mentally. Fristrom [68] proposed considering normalized burning
velocity as invariant quantity for curved flames, which helped
resolve differences between several methods, and explain the
behavior of flame tips and flame kernels in terms of geometry and a
single burning velocity parameter [68,69]. Garforth and Rallis [70]
and Rallis and Garforth [71] proposed a model to predict the gas
motion inside the constant volume chamber, which enabled com-
plete particle track to be constructed from measurements of flame
position and vessel pressure. This helped obtain accurate

distribution of gas properties behind the flame front to calculate
average gas densities there. These advancements are summarized in
Fig. 1.

Various advantages and disadvantages are inherently associated
with each of the techniques for measuring the laminar burning
velocity. For instance, spherical flame method is commonly used for
measuring the laminar burning velocity at high pressures. The
approach is susceptible to flame instabilities for combustible mix-
ture with non-unity Lewis number (Le = a/D , where a is the ther-
mal diffusivity and D is mass diffusivity). A change in the area of the
propagating flame front with time due to aerodynamic and bound-
ary conditions is called flame stretch and it is defined as logarithmic
rate of change of flame area with time [72]. Corrections due to flame
stretch are required for obtaining the accurate magnitude of the
laminar burning velocity. In 1951, Markstein [73,74] suggested a
dependence of flame propagation velocity on flame curvature. Flame
curvature and its effect on laminar burning velocity was later dis-
cussed by Sivashinsky and coworkers [75(cid:1)77] and other researchers
[33,78,79]. Flame stretch corrections to various burner flames, coun-
terflow flames and spherical flames were proposed in 1980 s by Wu
and Law [34], Lewis and co-workers [80], Matalon and co-workers
[35,81]. Subsequently, non-linear stretch correction was proposed
by Chao et al. [82]. A linear extrapolation may results in overestima-
tion of the laminar burning velocity [27,29,36,83,84]. Many non-lin-
ear correlations have been proposed to elucidate the non-linear
effect of flame stretch on laminar burning velocity [33,78,79,85(cid:1)88].

Several methods proposed recently do not consider flame
stretch. The flat flame based heat-flux method has been proposed
and investigated by de Goey et al. [63]. In this method, the burner
rim is externally heated to negate the heat-loss from the flame to
the burner and obtain the laminar burning velocity for adiabatic
conditions. These flat flames are not affected by stretch which facil-
itates data processing.

Another method of flame stabilization in a diverging tube was
proposed and demonstrated by Mullins [89]. This method was used
by the author mostly for investigation of ignition delays of different
fuels, e.g., kerosene-air mixtures [90], however, similar diverging
tube was used for burning velocity measurements for a hypergolic
propellant system of N2O4 + UDMH [91]. The approach of Mullins
[89,90] has evolved into annular step-wise and diverging channel
techniques recently. In annular step-wise method proposed by Kim
and coworkers [40,92(cid:1)94], the arrangement of multi-step configu-
ration helps stabilizing the flame at a particular location. Based on
the flame location and mixture flow velocity, the laminar burning
velocity and flame quenching distance have been shown to match
well with the existing literature. However, issues related to the
flame stretch, and heat-loss through annular walls and radiation
remain to be examined [40,92,93].

An externally heated diverging channel technique has been pro-
posed by Kumar and coworkers [114,115] to measure the laminar
burning velocity of various fuel + air mixtures at elevated mixture
temperatures. A linear wall temperature gradient along the direction
of the fluid flow helps stabilizing a planar flame for certain flow rate
conditions. Mass conservation across the stabilized flame helps
determine the laminar burning velocity at a given mixture tempera-
ture and equivalence ratio. Due to smaller dimensions of the diverg-
ing channel ((cid:1) 2 mm), planar flames are formed even for non-unity
Lewis number mixtures. However, various issues related to planarity
of flame in depth direction [116,117], effect of heat-loss to channel
walls [115] and extent of hydrodynamic stretch affecting laminar
burning velocity due to diverging section of the channel need further
attention of researchers to improve the accuracy of the technique.

Fig. 2 shows the variation of the measured laminar burning veloc-
ity for stoichiometric methane + air mixtures over last several deca-
des with different measurement techniques. It is to be noted that
spherically propagating flame and counterflow/stagnation flame
techniques were used dominantly to measure the laminar burning
velocity. However, the measured data converged to a value of
»36 cm/s, after stretch corrections to the measured laminar burning
velocities were introduced by several researchers in 19900s. Various
other techniques developed during last two decades, i.e. heat-flux
method, annular stepwise tube method and diverging channel
method have shown consistent results due to advancements in the
field of measurement of laminar burning velocity through the use of
laser based techniques and accurate measurement of flow rates. It is
interesting to note that most of the measurements have recently
converged to a range of 36 § 1 cm/s from a value of 37 § 4 cm/s two
decades back due to improvements in understanding various
theoretical aspects such as flame stretch, heat-loss effect and better
accuracy in measurement techniques.

Laminar burning velocity of a fuel + air mixture is affected by
various parameters such as mixture equivalence ratio, mixture tem-
perature, initial pressure, mixture dilution and other higher order
effects such as Soret and Dufour effects. Laminar burning velocity
strongly varies with equivalence ratio, a maximum occurring for
slightly rich mixtures (f (cid:3) 1.1) for most of the hydrocarbon fuels. H2
fuel is one of the exceptions where maximum laminar burning
velocity is observed at f = 1.8. Laminar burning velocity increases
with an increase in the mixture temperature due to Arrhenius
dependence of mixture reactivity on mixture temperature

laminar burning velocity on mixture temperature and pressure
can be expressed in the form SL/SLo = (Tu/Tuo)a(pu/puo)b, where a -
temperature exponent, b (cid:1) pressure exponent [28,101,118(cid:1)121].
The value of a is a function of various parameters such as fuel type,
oxidizer type, mixture dilution, pressure, temperature and equiva-
lence ratio [26(cid:1)28]. From detailed theoretical (both thermal and
comprehensive theories) analysis of laminar burning velocity, the
dependence of laminar burning velocity on pressure can be shown to
vary as SL/p(n ¡ 2)/2, where n indicates the overall order of the reac-
tion [122(cid:1)126]. For most of the hydrocarbon + air mixtures, the over-
all order of reaction is reported to be less than 2 with SL < 0.5 m/s,
indicating that the laminar burning velocity reduces with an increase
in mixture pressure. [28,127]. Due to this, the observed pressure
exponent, b is negative for hydrocarbon + air mixtures.

The dilution of various fuels or their mixtures with chemically
inert species results in enhanced flame quenching characteristics,
control on flame characteristics, emission control due to increased
specific heats, changes in transport properties and chemical path-
way of fuel oxidation [128]. Dilution of oxidizer and fuel stream has
gained significant importance in recent times from the view point of
fire safety, NOx emission control through flameless/mild combus-
tion, EGR and oxy-fuel combustion facilitating CO2 capture and
sequestration [129(cid:1)133]. However, the dilution of fuel + air mix-
tures affects the flame reactivity, thereby inducing flame stability
problems in combustion systems [22]. It necessitates better under-
standing of the effect of thermophysical and chemical properties of
diluents on flame propagation behavior. Perhaps a viewpoint on
laminar burning velocity from
understanding the variation of

the perspective of global dilution levels would help researchers
delineate the effect of global dilution, diluent type, and their role in
chemical reaction thereby affecting the combustion behavior as well
as chemical emissions through thermal and chemical routes.

To efficiently burn various low quality fuels and assist lean burn-
ing of fossil fuels to help reduce pollutant emissions, such as NOx
and CO2 thereby help achieve higher efficiencies, hydrogen enrich-
ment has been proposed and investigated [134(cid:1)144] Hydrogen
enrichment helps in improved flame stability limits, particularly at
leaner limits, faster flame propagation and ultra clean emissions
[145,146]. Similar various studies on understanding the combustion
characteristics of various surrogate fuels have been reported in liter-
ature with an aim to mimic an approximate representation of the
real fuel of interest [137,147(cid:1)154]. For instance, commercial gaso-
line is a mixture of hundreds of different chemical compounds.
Deriving a detailed chemical model for gasoline therefore becomes
impossible and fuel representation needs to be simplified drastically
for numerical simulations using a well-defined mixture of a few
components that will approximately match major physical and
chemical properties of real fuels such as H(cid:1)(cid:1)C ratio, density, and
boiling characteristics.

As discussed in the previous paragraphs, many techniques have
been developed to measure the laminar burning velocities of
fuel + air mixtures. Extraction of the laminar burning velocity of a
laminar, adiabatic, freely propagating flame with zero stretch is a
challenge which needs to be carefully looked into. This issue
becomes increasingly complex for non-unity Lewis number mix-
tures such as H2 + air (Le < 1) and C7H16 + air (Le > 1). A detailed
quantitative analysis by Wu et al. [29] on extraction of laminar burn-
ing velocity from spherical flames using various linear and non-lin-
ear models show that the uncertainties in stretch corrections for
nearly stoichiometric mixtures are minimum. These uncertainties in
stretch corrections however, are as high as 60% for lean H2 + air mix-
tures and »10% for lean and rich heptane + air mixtures [29]. Simi-
larly, the effect of heat loss on laminar burning velocity has been
discussed by Botha and Spalding [60], whereby detailed experimen-
tal investigation is presented for the variation of laminar burning
velocity with heat loss from the flames stabilized over a flat flame
burner. To overcome the effect of heat-loss on laminar burning
velocity, de Goey and coworkers [61(cid:1)63] presented a modified
approach to measure adiabatic laminar burning velocity using a
heat-flux approach to flat flame burner. To summarize, flame stabil-
ity, Lewis number, differential diffusion effects and uncertainties in
reactant concentration, mixture temperature and pressure are some
of the factors which contribute to uncertainty in the determination
of laminar burning velocity SLo.

Recently, Egolfopuolos et al. [84] have presented a review of vari-
ous LBV measurement techniques for determining the global flame
properties with a focus on detailed flame data consistency from
50 mbar to 50 bar pressure for fuel + air mixtures. Merits and demer-
its of each technique along with recent advances and potential sour-
ces of uncertainties associated with each technique are discussed
and appropriate recommendations have been made to increase data
fidelity, to enable accurate development of new kinetic models.
Ranzi et al. [155] have presented a hierarchical analysis of CRECK
reaction mechanism [155] by comparing the burning velocity data
for a range of alkanes and oxygenated fuels at various initial pressure
and temperatures. The aim of the authors was to present a hierarchi-
cal structure of the CRECK mechanism for various fuels and under-
stand the role of intermediate reactive species and various reactions
on laminar burning velocity. This hierarchical assessment of CRECK
mechanism was carried out with initial C0(cid:1)(cid:1)C4 species for alkanes,
cycloalkanes, aromatics and alcohol fuels and appropriate modifica-
tions incorporated in the mechanism. They observed that most
active radicals are hydrogen radical (increases burning velocity) and
methyl radical (decreases burning velocity). Authors presented a

comprehensive analysis of the CRECK mechanism for a range of
fuels. Detailed analysis of high-temperature chemistry of various
fuels was presented and role of important reactions and species was
brought out clearly to interpret various observations on the variation
of laminar burning velocity at elevated mixture temperatures.

The present review article is aimed at presenting detailed analy-
sis and comparison of the existing experimental data of the laminar
burning velocities for different single component fuels, particularly
with an added emphasis on its variation with mixture equivalence
ratio, temperature and pressure. The present review is focussed on
selected single-component fuels, for which significant amount of
measurements are available with different measurement methods
for a range of pressure, temperature and mixture equivalence ratio
conditions. These data are at times contradictory and require specific
analysis to bring out the data consistency through comparison of dif-
ferent experimental approaches, and data analysis using pressure
laminar burning velocity. For
and temperature dependencies of
many other
fuels, such as hydrogen enriched fuel mixtures
[144,146,154], binary fuels and multi-component surrogate fuel mix-
tures representing real fuels, limited LBV results are also available.
However, they are not covered in the present study due to (i) Lack
of independent measurements using different methods at similar
conditions, (ii) Limited availability of data at high temperature and
pressure conditions, (iii) Lack of specific kinetic models for their vali-
dation and comparison. This prevents a meaningful analysis of the
data consistency for these derived, multi-component, and surrogate
fuels. In Section 2, a review of the recent advancements of selected
laminar burning velocity measurement techniques will be presented
along with merits and demerits of each technique. Although, the
data obtained with many of these techniques corresponds to lower
pressures as temperatures, as high pressure instabilities are expected
to develop in these systems resulting in inaccurate measurement of
laminar burning velocity. Similar issues with fuel decomposition due
to higher mixture temperatures are expected at
temperatures
greater than 1100 K [156]. In Section 3, a review of various numeri-
cal codes used for predicting the laminar burning velocities will be
presented. Emphasis will be placed on the approach used for simu-
lating the propagation of the flame, discretization technique, solu-
tion approach and other related issues. Predictions using different
numerical codes will be presented and discussed. In Section 4, the
data on various fuels such as H2 + air, CH4 + air, higher alkane fuels
such as ethane, propane, n-butane, n-heptane, isooctane, n-decane
along with dimethyl-ether, methanol, ethanol and n-butanol will be
presented at elevated mixture temperatures and pressures along
with detailed analysis of the existing data in the literature. A brief
summary of the analysis will be presented for the existing detailed
kinetic mechanisms alongside in modeling the effect of various
parameters such as pressure, mixture temperature, equivalence ratio
and dilution for single component fuel + air mixtures along with rec-
ommendations to conduct focused experiments at various pressure
and temperature conditions for different fuels.

2. Introduction of selected measurement techniques and their
recent advances

Many experimental techniques have been proposed and devel-
oped during the last century to measure the LBV of fuel + air mixtures
including constant volume or constant pressure spherical flame
method [30,86,97,99,157(cid:1)169], counterflow or stagnation flame
method [34,81,108,110,112,170(cid:1)180], heat-flux method [36,61,62,
111,181(cid:1)187], externally heated diverging channel method [41,114,
115,188(cid:1)191] and annular step-wise tube method [40,92,93]. A criti-
cal review of stagnation/counterflow burner method, spherical flame
propagation method and heat-flux method has been reported by
Egolfopuolos et al. [84] . In the present paper, the recent updates on
these techniques have been reviewed and presented.

203

In addition to these techniques, other flame configurations have
also been used by researchers for detailed flame studies. For
instance, tubular flames are useful for investigating the stretch and
curvature effects on flame structure, as they are subjected to uni-
form stretch and curvature and each parameter can be varied inde-
pendently [192]. A tubular flame without rotation is formed inside a
porous walled cylindrical burner and in a radial in-flow burner
[193,194]. A tubular flame with rotation was realized using a swirl-
type burner and axisymmetric swirl burner [195]. For smaller rota-
tional speeds, the pressure variation caused by circumferential
movement is small and the tubular flame becomes equivalent of a
tubular flame without rotation as the circumferential flow field can
be uncoupled and solved separately [196]. At higher rotational
speeds, a strong pressure gradient exists with radius. Both the pres-
sure variation and its gradient influence the flame response and it is
not due to flame curvature. Analytical studies on tubular flames
have significantly helped in a better correlation between planar and
curved stretched flames. Studies with different fuel + air mixtures
helped elucidate the role of preferential diffusion on flame curvature
and flame propagation speeds [192].

Bunsen burner and slot burner flames have been explored by
researchers to measure the laminar burning velocities and provide
better understanding of various flame phenomena [197(cid:1)201]. In
Bunsen burner and slot burner method, the flame is subjected to a
negative stretch due to flame curvature at the tip of the flame. The
flame curvature and flame tip opening is a strong function of jet
velocity, mixture Lewis number and Karlovitz number. The phenom-
enon of tip opening can be explained using combined effect of mix-
ture Lewis number and Karlovitz number. Vu et al. [197] introduced
a local Karlovitz number, defined as the ratio of characteristic reac-
tion time in normal direction to characteristic flow time in tangen-
tial direction for the stretched flame. This formulation helped
authors to explain the tip opening phenomena in Bunsen burner
flames irrespective of the mixture type and mixture Lewis number.
Wang et al. [198] attributed the flame curvature combined with
preferential diffusion as the dominant effect for tip opening. Zhen
et al. [199] investigated the effect of hydrogen addition on flame
characteristics of biogas (CH4 = 40 (cid:1) 60% and CO2 = 60 (cid:1) 40%) and
variation of laminar burning velocities of the fuel + air mixtures. The
LBV can be measured with a reasonable accuracy for CH4 + air mix-
tures using a slot burner, however, may lack precision for other mix-
tures (i.e. H2 + air) due to preferential diffusion effects for non-unity
Lewis number mixtures [200].

2.1. Spherical flame method

In spherical flame method, a premixed fuel + air mixture is filled
in a confined chamber and maintained at known equivalence ratio,
initial temperature and pressure conditions. The mixture is then
ignited at the centre of the vessel. A spherical flame (Fig. 3) propa-
gates into the quiescent combustible mixture. Local flame properties
of expanding spherical flame are affected by unsteady flame propa-
gation, non uniform flow field, variation in flame curvature and dif-
fusional effects. These effects are summarized as flame stretch and
they significantly affect the flame propagation speed of the fuel + air
mixture [33,202(cid:1)204]. It is important to quantify the stretch effects
and to derive unstretched LBV from the measurements. Constant
pressure method [54,160] and constant volume methods [30,31,70]
are two variants in spherical flame method to estimate desired LBV.
These methods are discussed in the following sections.

2.1.1. Constant pressure spherical flame method

A critical review of this technique was recently presented by
Egolfopoulos et al. [84] along with various challenges involved in
understanding the (a) Effect of ignition energy, (b) Radiation effect,
(c) Linear/ nonlinear flame stretch extrapolation and associated

innovations evolved in freely expanding spherical flame method
during last three decades. Giannakopoulus et al. [32] with detailed
simulations stated that isotherm representing flame surface chosen
closer to the burned gas side yields LBV comparable to that of
asymptotic theory in the weakly stretched regime. Chen [205] men-
tioned that Schlieren/ shadowgraph technique to record flame
motion does not bring in any uncertainty in LBV. Once the flame
radius time history is measured, the stretched flame speed, Sb, is cal-
culated as Sb = drf/dt [33,84,206,207], where rf is the instantaneous
spherical flame radius. The estimated Sb, sometimes showed oscilla-
tions [95,208(cid:1)210], which were attributed to acoustic disturbances
arising inside the confined chamber. Smoothening algorithms were
proposed to remove these oscillations in Sb data [95]. For spherical
flame method, flame stretch rate is K= 2Sb/rf. The Sb needs to be
extrapolated to zero stretch to obtain unstretched flame speed, So

rized in Table 1. Recently, integral forms of equations listed in Table 1

2.1.1.1. Effect of flame stretch rate and extrapolation schemes. A brief
summary of the extracted data of LBV using linear and non-linear
stretch extrapolation methods for stoichiometric CH4 + air mixtures
is given in Fig. 4. It is interesting to note that stretch correction of
LBV using linear extrapolation method has resulted in LBV dropping
from »40 cm/s to »37 cm/s during last three decades.

Table 1 shows the available extrapolation schemes to correct
stretch effects. Matalon and Matkowsky [214] determined asymp-
totically the linear relationship (LS) between stretch and stretched
flame speed, Sb, with the assumptions such as Le»1 and flame speed
is unstretched to leading order. Matalon and Bechtold [215], Ronney
& Sivashinsky [85] and Kelley et al. [211] presented a non linear rela-
tionship (NE-quasi steady state form) between Sb and stretch appli-
cable for all Lewis numbers. Kelley et al. [211] expanded LS, NE and
LC in inverse powers of Rf and showed that NE and LC models con-
sider the 3rd and 2nd orders in inverse powers of Rf which improved
their performance significantly for mixtures with non unity Lewis
numbers as compared to LS which considers only 1st order in inverse
power of Rf. Chen [205] reported that the choice of extrapolation
schemes shown in Table 1 to correct stretch effects strongly depends
on mixture Lewis number and range of flame radii considered for
extrapolation. Recently, Wu et al. [29] proposed a new model (N3P)
and compared the results obtained from all available extrapolation
schemes as shown in Fig. 5 for H2 + air at different equivalence
ratios. They have shown that for mixtures with Le < 1, all the tested
extrapolation methods result in significant errors compared to simu-
lated unstretched flame speed. They proposed a technique to reduce
the uncertainties. They observed that if MaLinearKamid is calculated
(Malinear = Lb/dL is Markstein number, Kamid = KdL/Sb is Karlovitz num-
ber evaluated at mid radius in the chosen range, Lb obtained from LS,
dL = (Tad ¡ Tu)/(dT/dx)max is flame thickness estimated from one
dimensional planar flame simulations where Tad is the adiabatic
flame temperature and Tu the unburned gas temperature) from the

range of data chosen for extrapolation and lies between 0.05 - 0.15,
then the uncertainty in extrapolation can be controlled to a small
range of § 5% as shown in Fig. 6. Lipatnikov et al. [216] introduced a
procedure to identify the range of flame radii that can be used for
extrapolation without human bias. They reported that
the
unstretched LBV obtained from integral forms of LC and NQ models
were accurate for lean C3H8 + air and rich H2 + air mixtures. Liang et
al. [212] adopted a finite flame thickness expression (FTE) based
approach proposed by Frankel and Shivashinky [217] for extrapola-
tion of Sb to zero stretch rate for all Lewis numbers. Using FTE, they
obtained flame thickness, dL from experimental data. Recently, Li
et al. [213] reported another extrapolation model, NL4 (shown in
Table 1) for mixtures with Le > 1. They concluded that for mixtures
with Le 61⁄4 1, the performance of non-linear models is better than lin-
ear model. However, the anomaly is that the estimated values of Lb
using all models did not match with each other for the chosen
(same) range of flame radii. Xiouris et al. [31] proposed a new
approach based on direct numerical simulations to obtain accurate

unstretched LBV. Their key hypothesis is that the slope of the line
connecting each experimental stretched flame speed to the experi-
mental unstretched flame speed (to be determined) is equal to its
DNS counterpart. They reported that their approach is better as it
does not involve asymptotic model for extrapolation and also takes
care of the differential diffusion effects, which most asymptotic
models overlook. Huo et al. [218] recently mentioned that uncertain-
ties occur in extrapolation schemes due to model error and random
error. Model error can be reduced by choosing small value of |Lb/Rf|
and increasing the lower and upper bounds of flame radii chosen for
extrapolation. In the chosen range, if the number of measurement
points is larger, it will help reduce the random error.

2.1.1.2. Other uncertainties. Various uncertainties in constant pres-
sure spherical flame method is reviewed by Egolfopoulos et al. [84],
Chen [205] and Xiouris et al. [31]. Chen [219], Santner et al. [166], Yu
et al. [220] and Xiouris et al. [31] reported that utilization of thermal
expansion ratio, s, to calculate LBV results in errors due to radition
losses. Yu et al. [220] proposed an empirical correlation to estimate
the radiation heat loss from measured spherical flames with some
restrictions.

Importance of the correct evaluation of density ratio, s was
recently discussed by Naucler et al. [221] who determined LBV of
nitromethane + air flames at 1 atm and initial gas temperatures,
Tu, = 338 K, 348 K, and 358 K using the heat flux method. It was dem-
onstrated that conventional recalculation of flame speed into LBV
using density ratio of the unburned and burned gases at equilibrium
is inappropriate for spherical nitromethane flames due to large
thickness of nitromethane flame front.

To minimize the uncertainties in the calculation of burned
gases density due to radiation, stretch and Le number effects,
Balusamy et al. [167] and Varea et al. [168] directly measured
the local stretched burning velocity using non intrusive tech-
nique. Lefebvre et al. [222] reinstated the importance of flame
consumption speed [169,223],
typically free from restrictive
assumptions or approximations of stretch or thermodynamic gas
states. To estimate the consumption speed from experimental
data, the rate of change of unburned gas density is required, a
very challenging task for future researchers [219]. Detailed
uncertainty analysis of LBV for various parameters by Xiouris
et al. [31] showed that it ranges from § 1% to § 5% based on a
68% confidence interval for their studied mixtures.

In summary, it is clear that constant pressure spherical flame
propagation method should involve large confinement with unity
aspect-ratio to minimize the confinement effect in the regime of
interest. The chosen range of flame radii should have the value of
Malinear.Kamid = 0.05(cid:1)0.15 [29] to reduce the error involved in the
choice of extrapolation method. Method proposed by Xiouris et al.
[31] should also be meritoriously considered in future experiments
as it did not involve extrapolation schemes. With the present level of
maturity, a standard design of confinement and data processing
technique needs to be identified and practised by researchers to
obtain accurate results.

Some of the challenges in this method are: (a) chamber should
have large volume and unity aspect ratio (b) dual chambers required
for engine relevant operating pressures (c) artificial oxidizer with
helium is required to delay the onset of hydrodynamic instability at
high initial pressures (c) possible decomposition of liquid fuels at
higher initial temperatures and (d) seals used in the rigs may wear
which will compromise the overall integrity of the rig [31] .

2.1.2. Constant volume spherical flame method

Constant volume method (CVM) proposed by Lewis and von Elbe
[30] uses a spherical chamber without optical access. Unsteady pres-
sure-time history during the flame propagation event is recorded. In
a given measurement, burning velocities can be obtained for a range

of higher pressures and temperatures. Xiouris et al. [31] reported
that since higher temperature is achieved inside the chamber within
a short span of time during flame propagation, the decomposition of
fuel does not happen and also it did not affect the structural integrity
of the rig. It is being considered as a viable approach to obtain LBV at
higher pressures and temperatures that occur simultaneously during
compression stage.

In earlier days, LBV obtained using this method was found to be
less accurate due to the non-consideration of flame stretch effects
[224], consideration of linear x-p (burned mass fraction-unsteady
pressure inside the chamber) relationship [225,226] and radiation
effects [31]. Chen et al. [224] proposed a methodology to obtain
unstretched LBV from CVM. They mentioned that stretch effects
decrease with increase in flame size. If the pressure rise in the cham-
ber is more than 20% of the initial value, the measured LBV can be
approximated as unstretched LBV. Luitjen et al [225] proposed a
new burned gas mass fraction (x) and instantaneous chamber pres-
sure (P) relation to improve the accuracy. Metghalchi and co workers
[227,228] varied stretch rates in CVM experiments by changing ini-
tial conditions that were aligned on an isentrope. They emphasize
that the pressure-time used for the estimation of LBV fell in the very
weakly stretched regime. Xiouris et al. [31] extracted LBV data from
pressure-time history using a new hybrid, thermodynamic radiation
model. They reiterated that the stretch rate estimated from CVM
decreased with increase in pressure, i.e. increase in flame radius.
They pointed out that the possible reasons were (a) Lower values of
Sb due to inward motion of burned gases due to compression effect
with increase in pressure and (b) Temporal variation in the density
of burned gases. Finally, they mentioned that the burning velocity
calculated from the unsteady pressure data required no stretch
correction if the range of pressure chosen was above »2.5 times of
initial value. Omari et al. [226] recently proposed a new x-p relation
to improve the accuracy of the LBV obtained using CVM. They
mentioned that a favorable range of pressure data can be used
is 10% < (P-Pi)/(Pe-Pi) < 55%. Faghih and Chen [229] presented a
detailed review on constant volume spherical flame method.

Challenge of this method is that the determined LBV data from P-
t traces are always stretched even though the magnitudes of stretch
rates are very small [226]. For a given combustible mixture and
operating condition, still large discrepancy in value of LBV exists
between different groups [229]. Further studies are required to
improve the same.

2.2. Stagnation flame method

Stagnation/counterflow flame configuration was proposed by
Simmons and Wolfard [64] and extensively used to experimentally
study the structure, stability and extinction characteristics of pre-
mixed and non-premixed flames [230(cid:1)233]. Ladd and coworkers
[65,66] presented a theoretical analysis of a stagnation flow system
for premixed reactants along with experimental studies on CO-oxi-
dation system to study the kinetics of CO-humid air system. During
early 19800s, Law et al. [67] implemented the stagnation flow
method to determine the lean extinction limits for propane + air
mixtures experimentally. Wu and Law [34] and Zhu et al. [170] pro-
posed the extraction of LBV, SLo from stagnation flow burner configu-
ration. A steady 1-D laminar flame is stabilized in a well-defined
stagnation flow field [108]. Stagnation flow field is achieved either
by impinging two identical nozzle-generated flows or by impinging
a generated flow on a solid wall. For a premixed configuration, pre-
mixed fuel + air mixture is supplied from both the nozzles and twin
premixed flames are formed as shown in Fig. 7. In case of twin-flame
configuration, the stabilized flames do not have any downstream
conductive heat losses due to flame symmetry and only loss being
through a negligible component of radiative heat loss [84]. There-
fore, the only external effect on such flames is the flame stretch

given significantly better and consistent results as compared to lin-
ear stretch extrapolation method in stagnation flame method.

Recently, a detailed comparison of the laminar burning velocities
extracted from counter-flow burner method and spherically propa-
gating flames for ethylene and n-heptane was reported to assess the
accuracy and consistency of the two methods with detailed numeri-
cal simulations [179,235]. Notable uncertainties were observed for
spherical flames due to non-linear behavior between flame stretch
and laminar burning velocities. Multi-dimensional effects of flow
field on laminar burning velocity and ignition characteristics of
flames were recently investigated for various fuel + air mixtures
using straight tubes in stagnation flame method [23,236,237]. Signif-
icant discrepancies between 1D and 2D results were traced to the
assumption of constant pressure derivative term in momentum
equation of 1D model [237]. The nature of the flow field significantly
affects the ignition and extinction characteristics of the fuel + air
mixtures [23,236]. Laminar burning velocity was observed to remain
insensitive to the burner exit velocity profile shape and other param-
eters leading to two-dimensional flow behavior for CH4 + N2 + air
mixtures. Investigations of Niemann et al. [238] showed the impor-
tance of accounting for radial gradients with contoured nozzles for
counterflow burners. Application of plug flow boundary conditions
helped in simplifying the modeling of screened ducts in counterflow
burner configuration with good accuracy. Johnson et al. [239] ana-
lyzed the effect of nozzle shape and size to investigate the applicabil-
ity of 1D models in counterflow flames with plug flow boundary
conditions. Their investigations showed that nozzle diameters
greater than 12 mm help significantly reduce the radial effects and
provide reliable measurements, which can be accurately modeled
using 1D models.

Although most of the data reported in the literature is for CH4
fuel as compared to higher hydrocarbons, lower diffusivity of higher
hydrocarbons results in reduced differential diffusion of heavier spe-
cies under fuel rich conditions. Due to these issues, higher uncertain-
ties have been reported for rich mixtures of higher hydrocarbons
[180,240]. The effect of mixture Lewis number on flame structure
investigated by several groups
and LBV has been further
[178,240,241]. Their analysis showed that for large molecular weight
hydrocarbons, the flame behavior is affected by differential diffusion
in fuel rich mixtures. This affects the mixture reactivity further with
stretch resulting in increased uncertainties for this method. The ratio
SL,ref/SL,o remains independent of mixture Lewis number. SL,ref
increases with flame stretch for mixtures with Le (cid:3) 1. For Le (cid:1) 1
(H2 + air mixtures) reaction rates increases with stretch and flame
extinctions occurs due to reduced residence time [241].

Flow rate measurement, mixture preparation with liquid fuels,
and particle slip errors are other issues, which contribute to uncer-
tainties in the measurement of the laminar burning velocities. The
measurements become more complex for liquid fuels. A precisely
measured quantity of liquid fuel needs to be injected as a spray into
a heated oxidizer stream to completely vaporize the liquid fuel and
create a uniform fuel + air mixture [242].

2.3. Heat flux method

Heat flux method is a direct method for determining the LBV of
various fuel + air mixtures. In this method, the flame is planar and
stationary at the burner exit and the flow of unburned gases is nor-
mal to the flame front, so that the LBV is equal to the unburned gas
velocity. de Goey et al. [63] introduced major changes to the flat
flame burner setup to stabilize adiabatic flat flames. The heat loss
from the flame is compensated through the heat gain of the unburnt
gases when flowing through the perforated burner plate, which is
externally heated with hot water, circulated in a jacket on burner
head as shown in Fig. 9. The radial variation of the burner plate
temperature is measured using thin thermocouples attached on

introduced due to external flow effect in the form of hydrodynamic
strain [27,203]. For an ideal stagnation flow, the flame stretch can be
related to the local velocity gradient, dv/dr, which in turn can be
related to axial velocity gradient du/dx [35].

To capture the non-linear dependence of SL on K, Tien and Mata-
lon [81] and Davis and Law [173] proposed a new relation for deter-
mination of LBV. Wang et al [174]., Ji et al. [176], and Veloo et al.
[175] revisited the issue of non-linear extrapolation through numer-
ical approach and quantified the non-linear dependence of SL,ref on K
for small Ka values. A brief summary of the extracted data of LBV for
stoichiometric CH4 + air mixtures using linear and non-linear stretch
extrapolation methods is reported in Fig. 8. It is interesting to note
that with linear extrapolation method, the extracted LBV has
dropped from »40 cm/s to »36 cm/s during last three decades. The
non-linear stretch extrapolation method introduced recently has

Fig. 9. (a) Schematic diagram of a heat flux set up (b) Hole pattern of the burner plate de Goey and his coworkers [62,183,243] have reported a set of reliable data of adiabatic
burning velocities of gaseous fuels like methane, ethane, propane, n-butane and isobutane at atmospheric pressure with air as oxidizer. Bosschaart and de Goey [244] applied the
heat flux method for sub-atmospheric pressures (80(cid:1)1000 mbar) as well and concluded that due to excessive diffusion of fuel into surroundings and increased standoff distance
at low pressures, measurements were accurate only above 200 mbar.

upstream of the burner plate. For different gas velocities, tempera-
ture profile is measured and when this profile becomes flat [63], the
flame is adiabatically stabilized. For this condition, the gas velocity
becomes equal to adiabatic laminar burning velocity. de Goey et al.
[182,243] have shown experimentally using CARS thermomtery and
numerically that the flame stabilized on this kind of perforated
burner is flat.

Goswami et al. [186] extended the heat flux method for accurate
measurement of the LBV of methane + air mixtures to high pressures
(up to 5 bar). They measured the burning velocities at elevated pres-
sures for equivalence ratios varying from 0.8 to 1.4 and derived a
correlation for pressure dependence. These experimental studies
reported laminar burning velocities of lean H2 + CO mixtures at ele-
vated pressures for various oxidizer compositions [187,245]. They
could measure the LBV up to a maximum pressure of 10 atm. The
upper limit of gas velocity attained was limited to around 70 cm/s in
their setup. Using the same experimental setup, measurements of
laminar burning velocities of ethane + air and propane + air mixtures
were performed by Goswami et al. [246]. This study pointed out that
the decrease in burning velocity with pressure causes difficulties in
flame stabilization beyond 5 atm pressure.

Apart from the application of the heat flux method to gaseous
fuels, this method has been successfully applied to measure the lam-
inar burning velocities of various liquid fuels and alternate biofuel
blends as well [247(cid:1)249]. Konnov et al. [247] employed the heat
flux method for the first time to measure the burning velocity of
liquid fuel (ethanol + air), over a range of initial temperatures,
298 K(cid:1)358 K. Knorsch et al. [248] introduced a novel heat flux
burner system for the measurement of adiabatic burning velocities
of liquid fuels. Rau et al. [249] measured the laminar burning veloci-
ties of isooctane/ethanol blends at various mixture temperatures.
The experimental results of laminar burning velocities of liquid fuels
using the heat flux method are in good agreement with the existing
data, which shows that the heat flux method is apt for the measure-
ment of burning velocity of liquid fuels.

A detailed review on various factors affecting the experimental
uncertainty in the heat flux method has been presented by Alekseev
et al. [250]. They extensively analyzed the major uncertainty factors
arising from each part of the setup. After detailed analysis, they
approximately quantified the expected variations in burning velocity
(ΔSL) due to each of the above mentioned uncertainties. Some of the
major uncertainty factors and the proposed controlling methods are
briefly summarized in Table 2. Table 3 gives a brief summary of the
limits of contemporary heat-flux setups for measurement of LBV for

various liquid and gaseous fuels. Even though the results of LBV
obtained from the heat flux method are in good agreement with
various numerical predictions and results obtained from other
measurement techniques, there are certain inherent difficulties as
summarized below.

i. This method cannot be used for mixtures with higher laminar
burning velocities beyond 80 cm/s. To measure laminar burning
velocities greater than 80 cm/s, the hole size needs to be reduced,
thus making the fabrication of the burner a challenging affair.
ii. Measurement of laminar burning velocities at higher mixture
temperature is difficult as flame stand-off distance reduces
resulting in increased radical quenching over the plate [251].
iii. At high pressures, burning velocities are very low and flame

stabilization becomes difficult beyond 10 atm [187].

2.4. Annular stepwise diverging tube

Related to the chemical reaction mechanism, LBV has been of
interest and a perfect adiabatic and un-stretched premixed flat flame
has been pursued. However, a perfect adiabatic flame is not easily
achievable, and an unstretched premixed flat flame may not exist

due to Darrieus-Landau instability. Thus so far, the experimental
results have mostly been extrapolated to evaluate the adiabatic LBV.
However, recent advances in fast computations made it possible to
simulate actual simple laminar flame structures that were found in
the practical experiments. Therefore, multi-dimensional simulations
including detailed reaction mechanism will be adjusted more pre-
cisely based on experimental results.

Meanwhile, practical flame characteristics are directly affected
by heat loss and flame stretch, and they are mostly concerned with
the length-scales. Some representative phenomena affected by the
length-scale have been observed within narrow combustion spaces.
As a practical case, stationary premixed flames in tubes were experi-
mentally investigated by Kim et al. [252(cid:1)254], and it was shown
that the flame propagation velocity (FPV) defined as a relative flow
velocity to a stationary flame was comparable to the LBV if the flame
was not significantly wrinkled or elongated. The FPV and flame
structure have been numerically investigated with the variation of
channel gap [255] or tube diameter [256], and the results are shown
in Fig. 10a. The existence of a critical FPV that was less affected by
the length scales was found, and it was comparable to the value of
LBV of the given fuel + air mixture. It is notable that both simulations
were conducted for a frictional cold wall (300 K). Variation of the

flame shape from a hemispherical to a cusped dome is shown with
an increase in the length scale as shown in Fig. 10b [256].

Thus, the flame stretch at the center is expected to turn from a
positive value to a negative one near the critical FPV. In addition, heat
loss from flame could be compensated through the growth of surface
area and flow redirection within the dead space near the wall.

Since the critical FPV measured in a parallel channel was closer to
LBV than that of a circular tube, an infinite two-dimensional parallel
channel was preferred in the experiments. As a practical method to
formulate similar configuration, a tapered core was installed within a
quartz tube as shown in Fig. 11a [40]. Through a series of experiments,
an annular diverging tube (ADT) was formulated, and stationary pre-
mixed flames could be stabilized hydro-dynamically. Material of the
core did not affect the FPV if its temperature was not significantly
high. Using this burner, the existence of critical flame propagation
velocity was confirmed again experimentally as shown in Fig. 10a.

This ADT system was consecutively improved. First, the tapered
core was replaced with a stepwise core as shown in Fig. 11b [92]
resulting in the formation of an annular stepwise diverging tube
(ASDT). Consecutive backward steps helped stabilization of a flatter
flame in the azimuthal direction. Four types of cores were compared
and experimental resolution was improved by employing finer steps

in tapered portion. The location of stabilized flame was determined
more clearly, and the quenching distance was measured accurately.
Each step-unit was fabricated separately to have higher resolution,
and the core was assembled with selected step-units as shown in
Fig. 11c [93]. Thus, the experimental resolution could be regulated
by selecting suitable step-units. Heat transfer along the core
could also be reduced by placing a small cavity between neigh-
boring step-units.

With the improvement of the burner, experimental resolution in
the measurement of the critical flame propagation velocity (see
Fig. 12a) was improved significantly. Applicability of this method
was extended to H2 + air premixed flames [94] having much larger
laminar burning velocities using an infrared-camera (see Fig. 12b).

An improved ASDT system with state-of-the-art design configura-
tion was used to investigate methane and propane flames [257]. The
relationship between length scale, w, and FPV, Vf,
is shown in
Fig. 13a for various fuel concentrations (or equivalence ratios, f).
The overall trends were similar, and the existence of the critical
points was clarified in most cases. The relationship between f and
Vf is shown in Fig. 13b. The flame propagation velocity data shows
higher number density levels at the critical flame propagation veloc-
ity that was very similar to S0
L from the literature [258]. The relation-
ship between f and w is shown in Fig. 13c. The smallest length-scales
for each f will correspond to the respective quenching distances, wq,
and can be compared to the results reported in the literature [259].

The overall characteristics of flame propagation were described
in the form of a mathematically continuous surface in a new physical
diagram of Concentration-Length-Velocity (CLV-diagram). The CLV-
diagram of propane flames provides a bird's-eye-view on the overall
characteristics of flame propagation velocity as shown in Fig. 14. The

three projected planes of the CLV-diagram correspond to each one
in Fig. 13. Some physical concepts in combustion theories can
be clarified based on the CLV-diagram. For example, in a plane of an
arbitrary constant concentration (or constant f), a theoretical rela-
(cid:1)lMaK can be visualized. Here, lMa is the Marks-
tionship of Vf
tein length, and K is the flame strain rate. If the flame strain rate is
determined either by experiment or simulation, the Markstein
length will be extracted from the CLV-diagram. In addition, a direct
comparison between the critical FPV and the quenching distance can
help derive the relationship between quenching Peclet number, and

it will be possible to distinguish Lewis number effects. Similarly, var-
ious questions and discussions may be derived from this CLV-dia-
gram, thus the extended studies for different fuels in different
thermodynamic states are necessary.

2.5. Externally heated diverging channel method

2.5.1. Introduction

Fig. 15 depicts the strategy of stabilization of planar flames in
an externally heated mesoscale diverging channel [115]. External
heating of channel walls helps in creating a positive temperature
gradient along the length of the channel [260(cid:1)264]. A premixed
fuel + air mixture is fed through the rectangular inlet of the channel.
The reactive mixture is ignited at the exit plane and flame stabilizes
at a location, where flow velocity equals to mixture burning velocity.
The high aspect-ratio of the channel helps in the formation of uni-
form flow field and hence formation of planar flames [41]. A slight
divergence helps increase the range of inlet velocities over which
planar flames can be stabilized [28,262,265]. The external preheating
of the channel walls helps in stabilizing the flame at higher mixture
temperatures and maintaining nearly adiabatic conditions by com-
pensating the heat loss from flame to the channel walls and thermal
feedback from channel walls to the incoming fresh reactants mix-
ture. The laminar adiabatic burning velocity is determined by apply-
ing the conservation of mass at the flame front. To obtain the
accurate burning velocity of premixed fuel + air mixtures, flame
front must be planar i.e. free from stretch and curvature. The struc-
ture of flame is strongly influenced by the flow field.

A linear variation of flow velocity and wall temperature was
observed in the axial direction as shown in Fig. 16. The measured
velocity and temperature were nearly uniform in transverse direc-
tion as well for a range of flow rates inside the channels with aspect-
ratio greater than 10 [266]. Fig. 16 shows a uniform distribution of
wall temperature in axial direction for an air flow velocity of 0.5 m/s
inside a high aspect ratio channel (AR = 12.5) with a 108 divergence
angle. This is due to resemblance of Hele-Shaw flow inside a high
aspect-ratio channel. This uniformity of velocity and temperature
distribution governs the flame structure and helps in stabilization of
planar flames.

These planar flames were observed to exist for a range of flow
velocities (»0.3 (cid:1) 0.9 m/s) depending on the mixture equivalence
ratio and rate of external heating of the channel walls. Fig. 17a shows
a direct photograph of a typical planar flame stabilized inside the

Botha and Spalding [60] have reported the variations of LBV with
the heat carried away from the flames. Fig. 18 shows the variation of
the normalized burning velocity with heat flux for stoichiometric
propane + air mixtures. In Fig. 18, dashed (vertical) lines show the
range of the heat transfer from flame to the wall in the present
experiments and corresponding horizontal lines show the respective
deviation of LBV from adiabatic values. The deviation in the values of
LBV due to heat loss from stabilized flame to solid walls is 2 - 4%
lower than the adiabatic burning velocity. Reduction in the burning
velocity magnitude due to heat loss through channel walls has been
considered by Akram and coworkers [41,114,115,190,191,267] in
their uncertainty analysis and corrected the results for the same.

Thermal feedback from post-combustion zone through chan-
nel walls increases the enthalpy of the reactants, resulting in
increased burning velocity of the mixture. Low thermal conduc-
tivity (1.4 W/m K) of the channel walls makes thermal feedback
Increase in burning velocity due to
relatively less important.
thermal feedback is appropriately considered in the uncertainty
analysis [41,114,115,190,191,267].

2.5.3. Effect of hydrodynamic strain

The variation of hydrodynamic strain rate in a heated diverging
channel is shown in Fig. 19. The strain rate varies from 6 to 10 s¡1
for cold flow conditions. External heating of channel walls increases
the strain rate to 40(cid:1)55 s¡1 range as shown in the figure. Fig. 19b
shows a typical comparison with other methods where the LBV is
generally extrapolated from very high stretch rate conditions (200 (cid:1)
500 s¡1). A typical extrapolation of LBV from »50 s¡1 conditions
results in an uncertainty of less than 5%. This has been appropriately
accounted in the corrected LBV calculations.

2.5.4. Other uncertainties

Extensive uncertainty analysis of various parameters influenc-
ing the burning velocity such as heat-loss to solid walls, thermal
feedback, boundary layer, and difference in wall and reactant
temperature was reported [115]. The difference between the
average wall temperature and mixture temperature is less than
20 K and reduces the burning velocity by »5 %. The effective
channel area calculated by considering the effect of flame extinc-
tion near the walls due to dead space [256] reduces the effective
flame area and increases the burning velocity by » 7 %. Other
uncertainties related to temperature measurement, flame posi-
in an uncertainty of § 4%. The
tion and flow rates result

channel
Detailed numerical simulations on same channel geometry with GRI
mech 3.0 [268] showed the existence of planar flames as shown in
Fig. 17b. Fig. 17b shows the temperature contours for a stabilized
flame inside a diverging channel for stoichiometric methane + air
mixtures. The propagating flames are relatively planar in both trans-
verse and depth direction of the channel indicating the applicability
of present method to measure laminar burning velocity. Similar
studies on the formation of planar flame for certain wall heat trans-
fer conditions and their effect on flame shape, flame propagation
velocity have been discussed in literature [116,117,269].

2.5.2. Effect of heat loss to channel walls

To understand the effect of heat loss from flame to channel walls
on LBV, detailed analysis was carried out to obtain the heat flux dis-
tribution inside channel walls. Detailed studies were reported for a
range of equivalence ratios (f = 0.7-1.3) and inlet velocities
(0.3(cid:1)0.7 m/s) with different wall temperature profiles observed in
the experiments. The heat flux on inner wall near the flame is in
100 (cid:1) 300 kW/m2 range for different mixture and temperature con-
ditions. The heat flux on outer wall is in 10 - 30 kW/m2 range.

have been shown to compare well with unstretched LBV data
reported in literature within experimental uncertainties. A wide
range of experiments with lean syngas-air mixtures at elevated pres-
sures (1(cid:1)15 atm), temperatures (300(cid:1)700 K) with different mole
fractions of N2/CO2 diluents have been reported [273].

Dong et al. [276] reported LBV of syngas mixtures measured
using Bunsen burner at atmospheric conditions. Mazas et al. [277]
studied oxygenated methane combustion using nozzle burner.
They quantified that the strain effects estimated from measured
velocity profiles of the reacting flow field are reasonably small
[277] . However, they did not quantify the stretch effects contribu-
tion due to flame curvature along the flame surface and at the
flame tip. Bouvet et al. [278] measured stretch uncorrected LBV
using tubular/ nozzle burners using OH* chemiluminescence tech-
nique to identify the flame edge to obtain better results as com-
pared to other stretch corrected data. Boushaki et al. [279] studied
the effect of hydrogen enrichment and dilution effect with steam
addition to methane + air premixed flames using slot burner
method at 1 bar and 300(cid:1)330 K temperature range and reported
LBV without any stretch correction. The measured LBV was shown
to compare well with the literature data and numerical predictions.
Overall, the burner method is quite helpful in providing a good ini-
tial estimate of burning velocities provided the following issues are
carefully considered while using the burner setup for LBV measure-
ments. (a) Existence of a uniform unburned gas velocity profile,
(b) Large aspect ratio flames, (c) Large base diameter to minimize
boundary layer effects (d) Smaller value of the ratio of flame thick-
ness to base diameter and (d) Flame edge detected using OH*
chemiluminescence technique.

This method is not actively considered for accurate measure-
ment of burning velocity because (i) Boundary layer development
near the burner rim may extinguish the flame resulting in substan-
tial errors in angle method to estimate LBV [278] (ii) Variation of
burning velocity at the conical flame surface from base to tip as
shown in Fig. 21. (iii) Fig. 21 shows the strong effect of flame curva-
ture on measured LBV indicating that burner method is unreliable
at times. Stretch correction required to obtain LBV from measured

combined influence of all these parameters leads to an uncer-
tainty of less than § 5% of the actual value.

To summarize, externally heated diverging channel method
helps direct measurement of burning velocities up to mixture auto-
ignition temperature. Uncertainties due to hydrodynamic stretch
are minimum as fuel + air mixtures are subjected to very low
hydrodynamic stretch rates (»30(cid:1)55 s¡1). Certain issues related to
its applicability at higher pressures, and for mixtures with higher
burning velocity such as H2 + air and CH4 + O2 mixtures needs to be
explored further.

2.6. Burner method

Burner method is a traditional method used for determination
of burning velocities for various fuel + air mixtures.
In this
method, a stationary premixed conical flame is anchored at the
exit of the cylindrical/ nozzle/ orifice burner as shown in Fig. 20
under laminar flow conditions. The conical shape of the anchored
flame is due to the uniform unburned gas velocity profile at the
burner exit. The burned gases leave the flame by buoyancy cur-
rents induced due to heat release through combustion. Since the
flame is stationary, the LBV becomes equal to the normal compo-
nent of the velocity of the unburned gases and it is calculated
using following Eq. (3).

where SL is stretched burning velocity, ug is the velocity of
unburned gases, a is the semi-cone angle of the conical flame.
Another method to estimate burning velocity is by applying the

average flame area (Af) based on edge detected closer to reaction

Liu and MacFarlane [270] determined LBV of hydrogen-air and
hydrogen-air-steam mixtures using constant volume nozzle burner
with laser Doppler anemometry and Schlieren photography. Chung
and Law [204] and Sun et al. [271] using integral analysis derived an
expression for stretch correction of a curved flame propagating in a
non-uniform flow field. Choi and Puri [272] discussed the influence
of curvature of the burning velocity measured using conical flames.
Natarajan et al. [273,274] used this method for the determination of
LBV with slight modifications. They mentioned that flame surface
area estimated using flame edge identified closer to reaction zone is
free of curvature effects, however, still significantly affected by flow
strain. They imaged the chemiluminescence emissions of OH* and
CO2* from the flame using an ICCD camera and identified the flame
edge closer to reaction zone. The anchored conical flames with large

computational effort without sacrificing the accuracy of the results.
Based on adaptive grid methodology, Kee et al. [287] developed
PREMIX code, which has been used by many research groups for
computations of laminar burning velocities.

Marchionni et al. [288] introduced Redlich-Kwong equation of
state to PREMIX code to understand the effect of real gas thermody-
namics on computations of freely propagating CH4 + O2 + He flames
up to 150 atm pressure. They observed that up to 20 atm pressure,
both real and ideal gas formulation predictions are essentially iden-
tical. At 60 atm pressure, the difference in predictions with experi-
ments was attributed to lack of reliable chemistry and transport
models at these high pressures. Fig. 22 shows that real gas model
predictions are lower at high pressures and the difference increases
with an increase in pressure. This difference is mainly attributed to
the pressure effect on mixture specific heat capacity.

Brown et al. [289] reviewed the presently used approximations
and approaches for calculating the transport properties for various
combustion modeling applications. For calculating the transport
properties, four different methods such as, TRANLIB, MKC (for non
polar molecules), DRFM and ELGIB are generally employed. TRANLIB
codes developed by Kee et al. [290] are most popular in calculating
the transport properties in combustion models. They found that per-
forming more transport property measurements for mixtures that
include radical species is important. Dagdigian [291] examined the
effect of transport properties in simulations of freely propagating
H2/O2/He and CH4/O2, by performing numerical flame simulations
with two sets of transport data. They observed that there is signifi-
cant variation in LBV with respect to the transport property model.

3.2. Review of available numerical codes

Through a detailed survey, authors gathered information on
eight different numerical codes, which are currently being used for
computations of laminar burning velocities in various configura-
tions. CHEMKIN-II package has PREMIX and OPPDIFF modules,
most prominently used as they were originally open source codes
and later commercially marketed through REACTION DESIGN [292]
and nowadays by ANSYS. CANTERA [293]
is an open source
C + + objective oriented programming code for numerical simula-
tion of laminar premixed flames. COSILAB/RUN1DL [294] developed
by Rogg and coworkers in F77, shared for research up to 2004 and
later commercialized through Rotexo. Chem1D [295] is a 1D flame
computational code developed progressively by Eindhoven research
group. ASURF1D [296] was developed by Chen and Ju's group
in 2003, which uses operator-splitter method for computations.
OpenSMOKE++ [297] was developed recently by Cuoci et al. [298].
A brief summary of these numerical tools is given in Table 4.

3.3. Comparison of predictions with different numerical codes

To present a comparison of various numerical tools, authors
carried out detailed simulations with different codes for CH4 + air
flames at 300 K initial temperature and 1 atm pressure with GRI-

(vi) Quantification of radiation losses from stabilized flame [273].
(vii) Flame anchoring becomes a challenging task at higher flow
rates [273] and (viii) Quantification of real time flow field effects on
flame stretch rates and Markstein length cannot be quantified using
this method.

3. Numerical analysis of laminar premixed flames

3.1. One-dimensional simulation codes for laminar burning velocity

To evaluate various aspects related to understanding the varia-
tion of LBV, one-dimensional laminar premixed flame equations are
solved along with detailed reaction mechanisms. These numerical
tools helps to understand important aspects related to LBV such as
chemical effect of CO2 dilution, Soret and Dufour effects, and impor-
tance of radiation, mixture equivalence ratio, reaction sensitivity,
pressure, temperature, and role of various species in the combustion
process.

Spalding et al. [280,281] proposed a uniform grid based calcula-
tion procedure for one-dimensional unsteady laminar flame propa-
gation based on a two-dimensional boundary layer model. They
applied this methodology for hydrazine-decomposition and H2 + O2
flame. Tsatsaronis [282] computed laminar LBVs for CH4 + O2 + air
mixtures using computational model of Spalding et al. [280].
Warnatz [283(cid:1)285] modeled unsteady conservation equations
for 1D laminar premixed flames with multi-component transport
model for Ozone decomposition flames, H2 + O2 + air mixtures and
H2 + CO + air mixtures. Smooke et al. [286] presented an adaptive
grid methodology for calculation of LBV to significantly reduce the

Mech 3.0 [268]. All computations with various codes were per-
formed with GRAD = 0.02 and CURV = 0.1. The predicted values of
LBV from various codes are compared with LBV simulated using PRE-
MIX [287] as the base code. Fig. 23 shows the percentage difference
of computed burning velocities with respect to computed PREMIX
values for various codes at different mixture equivalence ratios. It is
interesting to note that the difference in burning velocity calculated
by various codes are within the limit of § 5%, usually acceptable due
to typically higher experimental uncertainties, even though COSILAB
[294] shows higher predicted values for lean mixture conditions.
These differences could be due the transport property formulation
and disctretization scheme used by each code.

Burning velocities at higher unburnt mixture temperature are
also predicted reasonably well by all the codes. The calculated burn-
ing velocity results of CH4 + air mixture at 600 K using different
numerical codes are compared with the experimental results of
Akram et al. [189] and Dirrenberger et al. [301] for various equiva-
lence ratios as shown in Fig. 24. It can be noted that PREMIX [287]
and CANTERA [293] are predicting similar values as numerical
schemes are similar and OPENSMOKE + + [297] and CHEM1D [295]
predict similar values as both codes use FVM for discretization. Fig.
24 shows the agreement between the predicted (GRI-Mech 3.0) and

measured values of burning velocity is not satisfactory at most of
the reported conditions. More research is needed to fine tune the
mechanism. In Fig. 25, the computed burning velocity of CH4 + air
mixture at 10 atm and 300 K using various numerical codes are com-
pared with experimental results. At high pressures, the maximum
deviation in the predicted values by various codes is less than 1.5%.

It is essential to use numerical code with adaptive gridding which
will help in better grid convergence. At very high pressures (i.e
above 20 atm) it would be essential to model mixture as real gas.
From the detailed simulations with different codes on LBV at high
temperature, it is observed that codes are consistent based on the
discretization scheme. All the tested codes predicted the effect of
pressure on LBV reasonably well, even though there is slight over-
prediction on lean side and slight under-prediction on rich side.

One should note that simulations for 0D conditions with the
same kinetic scheme are indistinguishable when using different
computer codes. Therefore, as it was discussed earlier the main dif-
ference between the flame codes is in the calculations of transport
properties, such as diffusion and second order effects.

The second order mass (Soret) and thermal (Dufour) diffusion
effects can significantly affect the flame front dynamics and there-
fore, cannot be ignored in many situations [302(cid:1)305]. For instance,
Soret effect drives lighter molecules toward hot regions and heavy
molecules toward colder regions of the flow. The effect becomes sig-
nificant for mixtures with low Lewis numbers i.e. H2 + air mixtures
[303] and relatively small for high Lewis number mixtures such as
butane + air mixtures [304]. Bongers and De Goey [306] studied the
effect of various transport models on prediction of LBV and found
that Soret effect is important for mixture involving lighter molecules
like H2. Also, neglecting Soret effect for H2 + air mixture will lead to
an error of »10%. Laminar burning velocity is strongly affected by
diffusion of H radical due to Soret effect [303(cid:1)305].

4. Effect of pressure, temperature and equivalence ratio on
laminar burning velocities of different fuel + air mixtures

In this section, detailed analysis of various parameters such as
pressure, temperature and mixture equivalence ratio affecting the
LBV for different fuel + air mixtures is reported. A brief discussion on
evolution of theoretical and empirical relations is presented to
understand the LBV dependence on these parameters. Detailed anal-
ysis of the experimental data and their comparison with the predic-
tions of various kinetic mechanisms for different gaseous and liquid
fuel + air mixtures has been carried out. Outlier data are indetified

and directions for future work have been proposed to help in the
development of better kinetic models for each fuel + air mixture.

4.1. Theoretical and empirical analysis of laminar burning velocity
correlations

4.1.1. Temperature dependence of laminar burning velocity

In general applications, from domestic appliances to engines and
gas turbines, the pressure and initial temperature of fuel + air mix-
tures are often higher than the standard conditions. Laminar burning
velocity of a reactive mixture depends on mixture equivalence ratio
f, initial pressure pu, initial temperature Tu, and dilution concentra-
tions. The correlations of the dependence of LBV on these parame-
ters are both based on flame theories and empirical.

Thermal theory of Mallard and Le Chatelier [46], proposed that
the conduction of heat from the combustion zone into the unburned
mixture controls the flame propagation. The laminar burning veloc-
ity relation based on thermo-chemical parameters is derived as:
SL 1⁄4 k
rCp

(cid:1)Ti
Tf
Ti (cid:1)Tu

ð4Þ

(cid:4)

(cid:5)

where k is the thermal conductivity, r the density, Cp the specific
heat, Tu (cid:1) unburnt mixture temperature, Tf (cid:1) flame temperature,
Ti (cid:1) ignition temperature, and d - reaction zone thickness. Though
the expression is very simple, reaction zone thickness, d is unfortu-
nately unknown. Further adaptation of Mallard and Le Chatelier [46]
approach gives a significant result as dependence of SL on reaction
rate (SL » 1⁄2 _v

000(cid:4)1=2) as discussed in Eq. (1).

Further analysis of Eqs. (1) and (2) with Arrhenius form of reac-

tion rates yields:

ð

(cid:4)1=2

ð5Þ

where Ea is the activation energy. Although, thermal theory provides
the dependence of burning velocity on physical parameters, effect of
diffusion of species in reaction zone has not been considered.

Thermal theory was extended with the inclusion of simultaneous
diffusion of heat and species by Zeldovich and Frank-Kamenetskii,
[122]. The dependence of burning velocity on various parameters for
a second order reaction was proposed as:

approaches showing the dependence of burning velocity on mixture
temperature were proposed by various researchers with Arrhenius
rate dependence [247(cid:1)251]. Metghalchi and Keck [158] reported
that, the correlation parameters vary erratically with equivalence
ratio, which makes physical significance obscure and produces diffi-
culties in smooth interpolation and extrapolation.

During 1950 (cid:1) 1980 period, the research associated with burning
velocity was dedicated mostly to understand the effect of tempera-
ture and pressure for stoichiometric fuel + air mixtures [307,308].
The expressions of the kind in which burning velocity is dependent
on initial temperature led to the use of simple empirical correlation
based on temperature as.

Based on this, the most popular correlation describing the effect

of initial temperature on the LBV is

where S0
L is the burning velocity at reference conditions (usually at

perature. The temperature exponent, a, varies with equivalence
ratio. Some researchers have reported this temperature exponent as
a function of initial pressure as well [107,309].

The procedure to evaluate uncertainties of alpha coefficients has
been developed by Alekseev et al. [310].These uncertainties were
evaluated based on the accuracy of the burning velocity measure-
ments. As calculated with the least square model, a is a function
individual burning velocities at each temperature, STi

4.1.2. Pressure dependence of laminar burning velocity

The correlations of the dependence of LBV on the initial pressure

are as well based on flame theories and empirical at times.

The simple physical approach of thermal theory proposed by
Mallard and Le Chatelier [46] offers significant
insights into
the dependence of burning velocity on physical parameters. For
instance, dependence of LBV on pressure can be obtained by consid-
ering the variation of reaction rate RR with pressure in Eq. (5) as:

(cid:9)
SL » Pn(cid:1)2

u

(cid:10)

ð11Þ

where n is the order of global chemical reaction. From Eq. (9), it can
be inferred that the pressure exponent, b = n/2 ¡ 1 and is 0 for bimo-
lecular reactions and ¡0.5 for the first order reactions. The indepen-
dent developments of flame theory by Jouguet [123], Crussard [124],
Nusselt [125], and Daniell [126], and Zeldovich and Frank-Kamenet-
sky [122] also led to the same result as reported in Eq. (11).

The first measurement of LBV at different pressures was reported
by Ubbelohde and Koelliker [118]. The most popular correlation
describing the effect of initial pressure on LBV is

Sharma et al. [309] and Bose et al. [312] interpreted their meas-
urements using Eq. (11), and presented discrete coefficients b0 for
different mixture compositions. Iijima and Takeno [107] derived a
similar correlation with parameter b0 linearly depending on mixture
stoichiometry. Dahoe and de Goey [119] analyzed Eqs. (12) and (13)
and noticed that both are in fact related through series expansion
though b and b0 are different in magnitudes. Smith and Agnew [311]
proposed an entirely different correlation based on exponential

variation of the pressure ratio. However, these correlations and
some other similar empirical correlations are not in common use
[313].

The pressure exponent, b, is observed to be a function of equiva-
lence ratio and range of mixture pressures over which the experi-
ments are carried out. For instance, Babkin and Kozachenko [314]
performed extensive studies of methane + air flames covering a wide
range of equivalence ratios, initial temperatures and pressures.

Considering the power-law correlations as the most popular cor-
relations [101,119(cid:1)121,313] for temperature and pressure depen-
dence, one equation describing the simultaneous variation of LBV
with pressure and temperature can be written as follows:

(cid:7)

SL 1⁄4 S0

L Tu=Tu;0

(cid:8)a

(cid:7)
Pu=Pu;0

(cid:8)b

ð14Þ

To summarize, correlations proposed in Eqs. (8), (12) and (14)
find their mention in most of the recent research articles reported in
the literature are summarized in Table 5.

In the following sections, the effects of pressure, temperature and
equivalence ratio on laminar burning velocities of various fuel + air
mixtures are analyzed. It will be demonstrated through detailed
analysis of the experimental data and predictions of kinetic models
that pressure and temperature exponents a and b used in Eq. (14)
vary significantly with mixture composition. Moreover, these empir-
ical parameters vary also with temperature and pressure. Thus
straightforward extrapolation of the LBV measurements toward
high pressures and temperatures relevant for engine conditions may
lead to significant uncertainties as will also be illustrated through
comparison of the existing data. On the other hand, unless we find
an accurate and precise technique for measurement of laminar burn-
ing velocity at high pressures and temperatures, these exponents are
useful to estimate the LBV with a good order of certainty. Even more
important, analysis of the pressure and temperature dependencies
helps in examination of the data consistency of experimental data-
sets obtained at different conditions and identification of outliers
not suitable for validation of kinetic models.

4.2. Laminar burning velocity of hydrogen + air mixtures

4.2.1. Mixture dependence of hydrogen + air flames

Typical presentation of the LBV measurements is in coordinates
SL versus equivalence ratio, f. Fig. 26 shows such an example for
hydrogen + air flames burning at standard conditions: atmospheric
pressure and initial temperature of the mixtures of 298 K. Only
stretch-corrected measurements are shown here starting with the
seminal work of Wu and Law [34]. The color codes group literature
data by decades since then. Also shown are predictions of three
recent kinetic models: Konnov [331], Keromnes et al. [332] and Alek-
seev et al. [310]. For this type of graphs further qualitative discussion

can be focused on agreement/disagreement of different sets of meas-
urements and on agreement/disagreement between experiments
and model predictions. Table 6 gives a summary of various kinetic
models used in the present work and respective labels used in the
figures for better understanding of the results in this paper for differ-
ent fuel + air mixtures. These mechanisms have been chosen based
on their application to prediction of laminar burning velocity by var-
ious researchers in the literature.

First observation from the data shown in Fig. 26 is that scatter in
the experimental results seems to be insignificant in lean mixtures,
while increasing around maximum burning velocity close to f = 1.8
and further in very rich flames. Law et al. [333] explained the
observed difference by significant asymmetry of the definition of
equivalence ratio which is skewed, being bounded by a finite span
between (0, 1) for lean and a semi-infinite span (1, 1) for rich mix-
tures. They suggested to plot the burning velocities for hydrogen
versus normalized and symmetrized equivalence ratio defined as
f = f / (1 + f). Indeed in these coordinates, the scatter in the
data obtained in lean mixtures becomes notable and comparable
with that in rich flames. Asymmetry could also be overcome in
coordinates SL versus log (f) as implemented by, e.g., Sanchez and
Williams [334].

Law et al. [333] performed statistical analysis of available data for
hydrogen flames at standard conditions using standard rational
function analysis and nonlinear least squares procedure. They found
that even obvious outliers such as measurements of Aung et al. [318]
and Hu et al. [326] are at the limits, but still within 2s confidence
intervals of the data. From the measurements shown in Fig. 26 only
results of Koroll et al. [316] and Zamashchikov et al. [330] at f = 7.1
are beyond 2s confidence intervals. However, even if these data are
denounced and not used for validation or optimisation of kinetic
models, remaining scatter prevents from decisive model improve-
ment based on laminar burning velocities.

with linear model (LM) originated from Wu and Law [34]; orange (cid:1)
counterflow burner with non-linear extrapolation (NLM) based on
the study of Tien and Matalon [81] for the data of Das et al. [328],
and on the work of Wang et al. [174] for the data of Park et al. [365].
Another observation hampering model validation for very lean
hydrogen flames is that flames actually propagates beyond the theo-
retical 1D flammability limits as seen in Fig. 27. This phenomenon
was often attributed to highly unstable nature of lean hydrogen
flames that easily develop cellular structures and flame balls even
subject to stretch as discussed by, e.g., Williams and Grcar [366] and
Alekseev et al. [367].

Three decades of experience summarized by, e.g., Egolfopoulos
et al. [84] show that the most important issue affecting the burning
velocity derived from counterflow or spherical flames is proper
stretch-correction. For example, processing of the same raw data
obtained in counterflow configuration using linear (Das et al. [328])
or non-linear model (Das et al. [328]) shows that non-linear extrapo-
lation yields apparent burning velocity lower by about 32% at a mix-
ture equivalence ratio of f = 0.3. At higher equivalence ratio, f = 0.4,
however, these models give results closer to each other and to the
earlier measurements of Vagelopoulos et al. [317], see Fig. 27. Simi-
larly, Park et al. [365] used counterflow technique and found that
non-linear extrapolation leads to significantly smaller values of the
burning velocity in lean flames with f = 0.32 and 0.45 as compared
to the linear model.

Vast majority of the burning velocity measurements (not only for
hydrogen, but also for other fuels) have been performed using spher-
ical flame method. All existing methods for stretch correction imple-
mented for interpretation of the spherical flames of H2 + air were
recently analyzed by Wu et al. [29]. It was demonstrated that all
methods overestimate the LBV, and the difference can reach up to
60% for the classical linear model of stretch correction [73].

Other problems pertinent to spherical flame experiments such
as effect of spark, critical radius, assumed density ratio between
reactants and products, and radiative heat losses have also been
recognized and discussed in Section 2. Due to highly diffusive
nature of H2, the applicability of the calculated density ratio
between cold reactants and products to convert flame displacement
speed into burning velocity is difficult to assess a priori. Therefore
Varea et al. [142] implemented the technique proposed by Zhou
et al. [368], and Balusamy et al. [167], for direct measurement of
the local instantaneous unburned gas velocity (denoted “direct” in
Fig. 27) and compared the results obtained to SL determined with a
common approach by assuming jump conditions across the flame
(denoted “indirect” in Fig. 27). It was clearly proven that these
two methods yield different values of the burning velocity with
the discrepancy increasing when equivalence ratio decreases, even
though numerical simulations predict similar results for the two
approaches.

Summarizing analyses of the burning velocities of lean hydrogen
flames derived from counterflow or spherical flames one may con-
clude that many results could be unreliable due to simplified proce-
dures of stretch correction. In both configurations, linear stretch
correction significantly overestimates the burning velocity in lean
flames and therefore cannot be used for kinetic model validation or
optimization. To avoid the impact of stretch correction, independent
measurements of the LBV of H2 + air mixtures using flat non-

data. It will be shown in the following that analysis of the tem-
perature (or pressure) dependence provides additional powerful
tool for assessment of the data consistency. Indeed, since the
LBV of the given fuel depends on the stoichiometric ratio, pres-
sure and temperature only, SL = f(f, P, T), interpretation of exper-
imental and modeling results using correlations outlined in
Section 4.1 provide additional dimensions, which allow for eluci-
dation of possible outliers or inconsistency.

4.2.2. Temperature dependence of hydrogen + air flames

Measurements of the LBV of hydrogen flames even with stretch
correction implemented are numerous as discussed above. However,
available data on the effect of temperature on the burning velocities
of H2 + air flames interpreted using correlation SL = SLo (T/To)a are
rather scarce. Heimel [369] and Milton and Keck [370] determined
discrete values of the power exponent a, while Liu and MacFarlane
[270] proposed linear correlations below and above the maximum
of the burning velocity as a function of equivalence ratio with the
junction value of a = 1.571. Iijima and Takeno [107] covered practi-
cally the same range of equivalence ratios (0.5 < f < 4) and observed
modest increase of a without a minimum. All these data were
obtained without stretch correction.

These measurements were analyzed by Konnov [372], who calcu-
lated laminar burning velocities of hydrogen + air flames in the range
of equivalence ratios from 0.35 to 8.5. From the calculations using the
model of Konnov [331] the temperature exponents a, were derived as
shown in Fig. 29. Modeling results confirmed modest variation of a in
the range of equivalence ratios from 1 to 3. For very lean and very
rich mixtures, however, the temperature exponent increases dramati-
cally. Sensitivity analysis revealed the reason of this behavior [372].

Apart from the studies mentioned above, where the temperature
exponent a was derived directly, a number of works [316,323,326,
328,329,371] presented burning velocities of H2 + air flames at room
and elevated temperatures without evaluation of the temperature
exponent in the form of Eq. (8). For these studies, the power expo-
nent a was extracted with a least-square fit procedure by Alekseev
et al. [310]. The temperature dependence of the LBV of lean stretch-
free flat hydrogen + air flames was for the first time studied by Alek-
seev et al. [367]. The equivalence ratio was varied from 0.375 to 0.5
and the range of the unburned gas temperatures was 278(cid:1)358 K. All
available and extracted from the experimental data values of a are
shown in Fig. 29.

stretched flames could be most useful. Therefore LBV of lean hydro-
gen + air flames and its temperature dependence were for the first
time studied in stretch-free flat flames on a heat flux burner by Alek-
seev et al. [367]. The equivalence ratio was varied from 0.375 to 0.5
and the range of the unburned gas temperatures was 278(cid:1)358 K.
The flat flames tended to form cells at adiabatic conditions, therefore
special attention was paid to the issue of their appearance by taking
OH* images with an EM-CCD camera.

The measured burning velocities of the lean flat H2 + air flames at
298 K showed an important difference to the previously obtained lit-
erature values, easily seen when comparing Figs. 27 and 28. Fig. 28
shows the results derived from the counterflow flames using non-
from spherical flames using “direct”
linear stretch correction,
method of Varea et al. [142], and experimental data of Alekseev et al.
[367]. The SL values obtained in flat flames are systematically lower
than the values derived from stretched spherical flames for leaner
mixtures. The present data, however, were found to be in a good
agreement with the “direct” dataset from the recent experiments in
spherical flames by Varea et al. [142]. Note that the second set of
data from Varea et al. [142] was obtained using a common method
utilizing the density ratio (“indirect” method) and not shown in
Fig. 28. These measurements at f = 0.45, and also similar results of
Dayma et al. [364] at f = 0.5 obtained using non-linear stretch cor-
rection are about 20% higher than the data shown in Fig. 28 consis-
tent with the analysis of Wu et al. [29].

For leaner mixtures only two data points obtained in the counter-
flow configuration by Das et al. [328], and Park et al. [365] are avail-
able. Following lines of calculated burning velocities as eye guidance in
Fig. 28, one may note that these two values significantly deviate from
expected trend. Furthermore, SL from the flat flame measurements
reported by Alekseev et al. [367] at f = 0.4 is only slightly above the
point of Park et al. [365] obtained at f = 0.32. This discrepancy strongly
calls for further experimental studies in very lean hydrogen flames.

Scrutiny of the data reliability as above is mostly based on the
critical analysis of the proper stretch correction performed in
several studies. For lean hydrogen flames, only limited data could
be considered reliable. However, in rich mixtures, the methods of
stretch corrections are more robust and could provide accurate

A new hydrogen combustion mechanism was developed and
employed to investigate the temperature dependence of the LBV of
H2 flames by Alekseev et al. [310]. Recent H2 model of Keromnes
et al. [332] was also tested. Modeling has been performed at atmo-
spheric pressure and in the range of temperatures 250 (cid:1) 500 K,
where majority of experiments were made. These two models
show very close performance at standard conditions as shown in
Figs. 26(cid:1)28. The values of temperature exponents a, were derived
from a least-square fit to the simulated data and the calculated val-
ues are also very close for different mechanisms. Further analysis
[310] showed that the value of a does depend on the fitted tempera-
ture range, which also means that the power law in the form of Eq.
(8) with constant a is not valid for a wide temperature intervals.
However, for the range 250(cid:1)500 K this empirical correlation is still
valid and thus can be used for analysis of the majority of the H2 + air
burning velocity measurements.

The models presented in Fig. 29 predict rapid rise of a for lean
mixtures, which is supported by the data of Krejci et al. [329] and
Das et al. [328]. The latter is the only study, which indicates a
very high value of the temperature exponent, a in a very lean
mixture at f = 0.3. However, it should be noted that in this case,
a is based on just two temperature points in a narrow interval of
25 K (298 K and 323 K), though the rise of the burning velocity
was considerable.

Contrary to a majority of the studies performed in spherical and
counterflow flames, the data from flat flames Alekseev et al. [367]
support the trend of increasing a with decreasing equivalence ratio
as predicted by kinetic modeling. It was shown experimentally that
a can reach values of about 3(cid:1)5 at f = 0.4(cid:1)0.5, see Fig. 29. This
observation also validates a as an important independent parameter
for analysis of reliability and consistency of the burning velocity
measurements.

To illustrate the suitability of the temperature exponent, a for
this purpose we first compare experimental data of Krejci et al.
[329], Hu et al. [326], Bradley et al. [323], Verhelst et al. [322] shown
in Fig. 30. In coordinates SL versus equivalence ratio, f over the wide
range (Fig. 30a), all these measurements seem to be in a good agree-
ment taking into account that specific temperatures of these experi-
ments were not always exactly the same. Closer look at only lean
flames in Fig. 30b indicates significant scatter and disagreement
between these datasets which may affect validation of kinetic mod-
els or selection of the most appropriate model for the present condi-
tions. The temperature exponents a,
for these measurements
presented in Fig. 29 clearly show that the data of Krejci et al. [329]
possess less scattering for the a(f) dependence than the measure-
ments of Hu et al. [326]. Moreover, in the very lean mixtures
(f < 0.5), not covered by Krejci et al. [329], the values of tempera-
ture exponents derived from the measurements of Hu et al. [326],
Bradley et al. [323], and Verhelst et al. [322] disagree with the calcu-
lated dependence. This deviation strongly suggests large uncertainty
in these measurements in lean flames.

Large discrepancies in the experimental data are also seen in
Fig. 29 for the temperature exponents derived from results of Koroll
et al. [316], and Desoky et al. [371]. Therefore their measurements of
the burning velocity should be excluded from comparison with and
validation of kinetic models.

Summarizing analysis of the temperature dependence of hydro-
gen flames one may conclude that the temperature exponent cannot
be treated as a constant for hydrogen flames, even to a first approxi-
mation. For a given fuel-oxidizer mixture, it strongly depends on
equivalence ratio, diluent content and correlation temperature
interval. A rapid increase of a in very lean mixtures was observed as
supported by the data of Krejci et al. [329], Das et al. [328] and Alek-
seev et al. [367], yet new experimental measurements in the very
lean H2 + air mixtures are required to confirm the quality of the
model prediction for these conditions.

4.2.3. Pressure dependence of hydrogen + air flames

Unstretched laminar burning velocities of hydrogen + air flames
at high pressures are available for a limited number of combinations
of the mixture composition and pressure mostly from constant vol-
ume bombs [159,162,315,320,373]. The systematic measurements
of hydrogen + air mixtures [373] are shown in Fig. 31. The experi-
mental uncertainty of »12% was specified by the authors [318,373].
The experimental results also obtained in spherical flames from Qiao
et al. [374] at 0.5 and 1 atm, and from Dayma et al. [364] at
0.5(cid:1)3 atm are given for comparison. Measurements of laminar burn-
ing velocities were conducted using a technique based on particle
tracking velocimetry and image processing for burner-stabilized
nozzle-type flames in a high-pressure chamber by Qin et al. [375] at
1(cid:1)3 atm. The predictions of three recent kinetic models: Konnov
[331], Keromnes et al. [332] and Alekseev et al. [310] are also shown.
Although predictions of these models are not used for screening of
the measurements, one may note that agreement between models is
much better as compared to significant scatter in experiments. To
show that discrepancies between different measurements are not
only of quantitative, but qualitative as well as shown in Fig. 32.

In lean mixtures with equivalence ratios between 0.446 and 0.5
only measurements at subatmospheric pressures reported by Egol-
fopoulos and Law [315] seem to follow expected trend supported by

the modeling. Results of Dayma et al. [364] possess large scatter,
while those of Aung et al. [373] clearly show unusual behavior at
pressures above 2 atm.

For mixtures closer to stoichiometry, obvious outliers are the
measurements of Pareja et al. [327] and Kitagawa et al. [376]. For
mixtures reporting a maximum burning velocity at equivalence
ratios of f = 1.7(cid:1)1.8 again outliers are the data from Pareja et al.
[327]. Finally, in rich mixtures with f = 3.0, the measurements of
Qin et al. [375] contradict all other data.

It is remarkable that the measurements of Aung et al. [318,373]
rapidly converge with the calculated burning velocities with pres-
sure rise at mixture equivalence ratios from stoichiometric to rich
mixtures. Yet, they are obvious outliers and consistently lower than
other data from the literature for pressures below »2 atm.

4.2.4. Effects of dilution on laminar burning velocity of hydrogen flames
Numerous experimental studies were devoted to investigations
on flame propagation in H2 + O2 + diluent mixtures. For example,
replacement of N2 by He allowed investigating stable spherical
flames up to 60 atm [99,162]. For other diluents hydrogen flames are
prone to hydrodynamic and diffusive-thermal instabilities. Burke
et al. [324] demonstrated that mass burning rate (SL multiplied by
density) of lean H2 + O2 + He flames increases from atmospheric to
relatively high pressures (about 10 atm) but further pressure
increase reduces it. Therefore overall reaction order derived from
this pressure dependence assumes negative values.

Since the focus of the present overview is on data consistency the
discussion will be limited to mixtures of H2 + air with addition of
inert gases. In this type of experiments, dilution is often defined
as amount of additional inert in the H2 + air that is D = inert /
(H2 + air + inert). Then, at a fixed equivalence ratio, monotonic and
almost linear decrease in LBV as a function of D was often observed.
This is illustrated in Fig. 33. The experimental data are taken from
the systematic study of Qiao et al. [374,377] who investigated the

effects of several diluents, Ar, He, N2, and CO2, on the near-limit
properties of laminar, premixed outwardly propagating spherical
flames in a short-drop free-fall laboratory facility. Also shown are
measurements of Taylor [95], Egolfopoulos and Law [315], Her-
manns et al. [378] and Paidi et al. [190] in stoichiometric flames.

For a wide range of dilutions (up to D = 0.3 (cid:1) 0.4), linear trends
were observed for different diluents as seen in Fig. 33a. However,
close to flammability limits (significant degree of dilution shown in
Fig. 33b), these linear trends do not hold anymore. Different convex
or concave shaped behaviours are observed for different inert
diluents, e.g., Ar and He both experimentally and in the different
models (Konnov [331], Keromnes et al. [332], Alekseev et al. [310])
tested in Fig. 33. Similar trends were observed for the LBV of rich
(ɸ = 1.8) H2 + air + diluent flames at standard conditions for a range
of dilution varying from 0 to 75% in the total mixture as reported by
Qiao et al. [374,377].

Qiao et al. [374,377] analysed relative effectiveness of the diluents
defined as the fractional reduction of SL at any fixed diluent concen-
tration relative to its undiluted value. The effectiveness increases in
the order He < Ar < N2 < CO2, with CO2 being most effective. This
ranking was explained by Qiao et al. [374,377] and attributed to their
increasing specific heats that lead to progressively reduced flame
temperatures and thus reduced flame burning velocity.

Monotonic, yet non-linear dependence observed in Fig. 33 and
in other studies strongly suggest that physical effect of the flame
temperature reduction is accompanied by chemical effects.
Indeed, although He, Ar and, to much degree, N2 do not react pro-
ducing other products, they are chemically involved since they
participate as third-body collisional partners in chemical reac-
tions, e.g., H + O2 (+ M) = HO2 (+ M) modifying their rate constants.
For this reason experimental data and modeling for CO2 is not
shown in Fig. 33 since the three recent kinetic models: Konnov
[331], Keromnes et al. [332] and Alekseev et al. [310] tested do
not include reactions with carbon dioxide.

4.2.5. Validation of hydrogen kinetic mechanisms in predicting the
laminar burning velocity

It is common practice to present experimental data on laminar
burning velocities together with predictions of detailed kinetic

models and analyze the agreement between them. But which model
is better suited for the flame propagation modeling? Recently
Olm et al. [379] compared performance of 19 recently published
hydrogen combustion mechanisms against experimental data on

ignition delays in shock tubes and rapid compression machines, con-
centration(cid:1)time profiles in flow reactors, outlet concentrations in
jet-stirred reactors and flame burning velocity measurements cover-
ing wide ranges of temperature, pressure and equivalence ratio. A
large set of experimental data including 631 data points in 73 data-
sets for burning velocities of hydrogen was used initially assuming
equal weight of these measurements.

Summarizing overall behavior of these models Olm et al. [379]
concluded that the mechanism of K(cid:2)eromn(cid:3)es et al. [332] was the
(cid:2)
best, but the mechanisms NUIG-NGM-2010 [380],
OConaire et al.
[381], Konnov [331], Li et al. [351] and Burke et al. [324] have simi-
larly good overall performances. Note that the models of Alekseev
et al. [310] and Konnov [382] were not included in this analysis,
moreover later Varga et al. [383] developed an optimized model for
hydrogen combustion which was shown to have superior perfor-
mance as compared to all mechanisms reported in the literature.

Comparison of the best hydrogen models by Olm et al. [379] and
Varga et al. [383] revealed several trends indicating data quality and
consistency of different categories of experimental data. Flame burn-
ing velocities measured using the flame cone method were poorly
reproduced. This is consistent with the lack of stretch correction in
data processing of the measurements using this method. Therefore
the data obtained with the flame cone method should be ignored in
model validation or optimization.

Agreement with the data from outwardly propagating spherical
flame method, counterflow twin-flame technique, and heat flux
burner method improved in this order. The scattering of the data
from spherical flames is due to the difficulties associated with exper-
imental determination of SL from stretched flames [29,142] as dis-
cussed above. Olm et al. [379] also observed that the reproduction of
the measured laminar burning velocities improved with increasing
pressure and total diluent concentration, and decreasing equiva-
lence ratio.

The influence of poorly reproduced experiments on the model
comparison and model optimization was further investigated by
Varga et al. [383]. They found that the following datasets should be
excluded from the final optimization runs due to inconsistency with
the bulk of literature data: All measurements of Qin et al. [375]
obtained using burner-stabilized nozzle-type flames. This is consis-
tent with discrepancies seen in Figs. 31 and 32 and discussed in rela-
tion to pressure dependence of the burning velocities.

Several datasets obtained in spherical flames, namely H2 + air at 1
atm and 0.35 atm by Aung et al. [318] and Aung et al. [373], respec-
tively, and also H2 + O2 + N2 flames with oxygen concentrations in
the oxidizer of order of 12.5 and 15% at 1 atm and 298 K as reported
by Aung et al. [373]. These outliers are seen in Figs. 26(cid:1)28 and 32
and discussed in relation to temperature and pressure dependence
of the burning velocities. In the same context, the measurements of
Hu et al. [326] were found inconsistent especially for lean flames,
which could be explained through the implementation of the linear
stretch correction as discussed by Wu et al. [29].

4.3. Laminar burning velocity of methane + air mixtures

4.3.1. Mixture dependence of methane + air flames

Due to the simple molecular structure, combustion characteris-
tics such as LBV of methane + air mixtures have been widely studied
and reviewed over several decades [59,84,119,308]. The effect of
stretch on the LBV of methane + air mixture was first considered in
the seminal work of Wu and Law [34]. The LBV of methane + air mix-
tures at atmospheric pressure and initial temperature of 300 K is
plotted against the mixture equivalence ratio, f and shown in
Fig. 34. Preferably, stretch-corrected measurements are considered
here, starting with the work of Wu and Law (1985) [34]. The color
codes group the literature data by decades since then. Also shown
are the predictions of various detailed kinetic models: GRI mech 3.0

[268], San Diego mech [335], Konnov mech 0.5 [337], and USC mech
II [336] for comparison purpose with the experimental data.

The maximum magnitude of LBV for methane + air mixtures is
observed to exist for slightly rich mixtures and burning velocity
decreases on both sides of the stoichiometry. This is due to the disso-
ciation of CO2 at relatively higher flame temperatures of stoichio-
metric mixtures as compared to lean and very rich mixtures to bring
down the combustion intensity. However, it is to be noted that a
large scatter (about § 5 cm/s) can be seen in Fig. 34 for near stoichio-
metric mixtures compared to both lean and rich mixtures
(about § 3 cm/s). The highest values (43 cm/s for f = 1.0) with
stretch correction in spherical flames were reported by Tseng et al.
1993 [385]. However, in later works Aung et al. [96] revised their
data with correct heat of formation and density ratios which
resulted in reduced magnitudes of
laminar burning velocities
(34 cm/s for f = 1.0).

The large discrepancies between the experimental data could be
due the different measurement and data extraction techniques.
Bunsen burner method was used for the burning velocity measure-
ment by Ogami and Kobayashi [394], Ouitmette et al. [388], and
Mitu et al. [393]. This method is significantly influenced by flame
stretch and heat losses to the burner rim. The heat flux method van
Maaren et al. [61], annular diverging channel method Akram et al.
[189], and annular step-wise method Liu and Kim [93] do not
require any stretch corrections as the flames were flat and planar.
However, they either corrected the LBV for heat losses (in case of
diverging channel method) or compensated for heat loss (in case of
heat flux method).

Spherical flame method has been widely used for burning veloc-
ity measurements. As the outwardly propagating spherical flames
are associated with stretch, a correction is required to obtained
accurate burning velocity. However, the stretch correction was not
considered by the various researchers [101,107,119,120,386], as
they utilized pressure-time recording.

Fig. 35 further summarizes the available stretch-corrected data
obtained with spherical flame method and stagnation flame method
at standard conditions and predictions from different kinetic models.
The color codes denote the measurement method and stretch-
correction approach implemented: green (cid:1) spherical flame method
with linear model (LM) suggested by Markstein [73]; blue (cid:1) spheri-
cal flame method with non-linear model (NLM) of Kelley and Law
[86]; red (cid:1) stagnation flame method with linear model (LM) origi-
nated from Wu and Law [34]; orange (cid:1) stagnation flame method
with non-linear extrapolation (NLM) based on the work of Wang
et al. [174]. Only recent measurements are shown from specific
research groups e.g., by Faeth and co-workers Hassan et al. [97],

Due to the implementation of stretch corrections, the scatter has
reduced significantly. Only Liao et al [100] have reported laminar
burning velocities of »40 cm/s for stoichiometric methane + air mix-
tures measured using the spherical flame methods with linear
extrapolation model. It is interesting to note that stagnation flame
data with non-linear extrapolation is higher for lean mixtures and
lower for rich mixtures than linear extrapolation data. However, in
spherical flame method, non-linear stretch corrected data is consis-
tently lower for all mixture equivalence ratios.

To avoid the impact of stretch correction, comparison of the LBV
of methane + air mixtures using flat non-stretched flames could be
most useful. Fig. 36 shows the recent data from the heat flux method
[186,301], diverging channel method [189], and annular step-wise
method [93] in comparison with all available non-linear stretch cor-
rected data obtained using spherical/counterflow flame method.
Also shown are the predictions from various detailed kinetic models
available in literature: San Diego mech [335], Konnov mech [337],
GRI mech 3.0 [268], and USC mech II [336] for comparison purpose

with the experimental data. There is a good agreement between the
computational predictions of various detailed mechanisms over the
range of equivalence ratios. However, the kinetic models appear to
under-predict the burning velocity for highly rich mixture compared
to data reported by Direnberger et al. [301].

4.3.2. Temperature dependence of methane + air flames

The simultaneous effect of mixture equivalence ratio, pressure,
and temperature on the variation of LBV is correlated using Eq. (14).

Fig. 37 shows the variation of the temperature exponent, a, for
methane + air mixtures obtained with different methods and extrap-
olation techniques. The value of temperature exponent, a for stoi-
chiometric mixture exhibits a significantly large scatter. A recent
trend shows that the value of the temperature exponent has con-
verged to a »1.6 with relatively small variation across various mea-
surement techniques. It is also interesting to note that there is a
large discrepancy in the variation of temperature exponent with the
mixture equivalence ratio as shown in Fig. 37. Experimental uncer-
tainties associated with the measurements are shown with uncer-
tainty bars as reported by Akram et al. [189] and Dirrenberger et al.
[301]. A slight increase in a was observed by Iijima and Takeno
[107] for a range of 0.8 (cid:1) f (cid:1) 1.3. A slight decrease in a from lean to
rich mixtures was observed by Bose et al. [312] and Takizawa et al.
[101]. In another study, Stone et al. [120] proposed a linear correla-
tion, in which temperature exponent, a decreases linearly with mix-
ture equivalence ratio as shown in Fig. 37. Sharma et al. [309]

proposed separate expressions for rich and lean mixtures and their
experiments were limited for a mixture equivalence ratio range of
0.8 - 1.2. They observed that a minimum value of temperature expo-
nent, a exists for near stoichiometric mixture, which was later
confirmed by several researchers through their experimental studies
[98,100,189,390].

Large discrepancies between the temperature exponent values
could be due to different measurement and data extraction techni-
ques employed by researchers. Ouitmette et al. [388] used Bunsen
burner method without any stretch corrections. Spherical flame
method, without stretch corrections, was used by Sharma et al.
[309], Iijima and Takeno [107], Bose et al. [312], Stone et al. [120],
Dahoe and de Goey [119], and Takizawa et al. [101]. All these
data are shown by magenta colour code. Spherical flame method
with linear extrapolation was used by Gu et al. [98] and Liao et al.
[100]. Further analysis reveals that the large scatter is due to non-
consideration of stretch effects while extracting the values of tem-
perature exponent and laminar burning velocities.

Fig. 38 shows a comparison between the temperature exponent
derived from the data with stretch corrections and from flat flames
obtained using the heat flux and diverging channel methods. Experi-
mental studies of the temperature dependence of methane flames
have long history, however, there were no computational studies
until Konnov [372] derived and analyzed power exponents, a using
detailed kinetic models. Computational predictions of temperature
exponent using various detailed kinetic mechanisms confirm the
existence of a minimum value of a with mixture equivalence ratio
for slightly rich mixtures. A moderate decrease in the temperature
rich mixtures was predicted through

computational studies and this trend has been well supported
through the observations of Yan et al. [396] and Dirrenberger et al.
[301] as shown in Fig. 38, where only stretch corrected data are con-
sidered. A significant deviation can be seen in the magnitudes of
temperature exponent, a, for highly rich mixtures. The measure-
ments of Dirrenberger et al. [301] using the heat flux method are

able to predict the variation of temperature exponent qualitatively
well. The measurements of Akram et al. [189] show the variation of
temperature exponent with significantly reduced uncertainty as
they reported the experimental measurement of laminar burning
velocities up to 600 K mixture temperature and derived the temper-
ature exponent from a large range of experimental data.

mechanisms except Konnov mech [337] give slightly higher values
when compared with very recent data of Dirrenberger et al. [301]
and Hu et al. [106] data using non-linear model for stretch extrapo-
lation. The disagreement between various kinetic mechanisms is
also notable at higher mixture temperatures. A rigorous analysis of
both the existing mechanisms as well as experimental techniques is
required to further reduce the scatter at elevated temperatures.

4.3.3. Pressure dependence of methane + air flames

The variation of the pressure exponent with mixture equivalence
ratio is also very important to understand the variation of LBV at
higher pressures. Fig. 40 shows the various trends reported in litera-
ture for the pressure exponent with equivalence ratio. A recent study
of Mitu et al. [393] has shown erratic variation in the pressure expo-
nent depicting no trend in the dependence of pressure exponent, b
on equivalence ratio. Dahoe and de Goey [119] reported modest
increment of pressure exponent, b with equivalence ratio. Whereas,
Stone et al. [120] and Takizawa et al. [101] have reported significant
decrement of pressure exponent, b with equivalence ratio, f. A
modest increment for lean mixtures till near stoichiometric mixture
and then decrement has been observed by Liao et al. [100], Gu et al.
[98], Goswami et al. [186], and Dirrenberger et al. [301]. Halter et al.
[102] reported similar trend with lower magnitudes and similar var-
iations. Goswami et al. [186] also reported an increase in the pres-
sure exponent, b for highly rich mixtures (f > 1.3) as can be seen in
Fig. 40. Experimental uncertainties associated with the measure-
ments are shown with uncertainty bars as reported by Goswami
et al. [186] and Dirrenberger et al. [301]. The possible reasons for
large discrepancies in the reported values of pressure exponents by
different researchers could be due to different measurement and
data extraction techniques. Ouitmette et al. [388] and Mitu et al.
[393] used Bunsen burner method without any stretch corrections.
Spherical flame method, without stretch corrections, was used by
Stone et al. [120], Dahoe and de Goey [119], and Takizawa et al.
[101]. All these data without any stretch correction are shown by
magenta colour code. Spherical flame method with linear extrapola-
tion was used by Gu et al. [98] and Liao et al. [100]. Further analysis
reveals that the large scatter in the reported value of pressure

rect (obtained using Eq. (8) with the reported values of S0
L and a,

ture temperature for all the mixtures. A reasonably good agreement
can be seen between various experiments and computations at
lower mixture temperatures of 373 K and 443 K. The LBV reported
by Hu et al. [106] using a linear stretch model gives higher values for
richer mixtures compared to non-linear stretch model. There exist
little differences for lean mixtures between the predictions of differ-
the
ent mechanisms

and experimental measurements. All

coefficient from the literature is due to omission of stretch correc-
tion in the reported data measured using spherically propagating
flames and Bunsen burner method at higher initial pressures.

Fig. 41 shows a good agreement and consistency between the
pressure exponent, b derived from the measurements using stretch
corrections and the heat-flux method. A qualitative agreement can
be observed with stretch corrected data and data obtained with the
heat flux method. Fig. 41 also shows a comparison of the computa-
tional and experimental results taking the parabolic variation of
pressure exponent into considerations. Computational data using
detailed kinetic mechanisms exhibit qualitative similarity but not
quantitatively over the complete range of equivalence ratios investi-
gated in their studies. Computations also show a parabolic variation
with equivalence ratios with a sharp increment in pressure expo-
nent for equivalence ratios, f > 1.3. However, USC mech II [336] pre-
dicts slightly higher magnitudes of the pressure exponent for lean
mixtures as compared to GRI mech 3.0 [268] and experiments. It is
to be noted that the experimental data of Dirrenberger et al. [301]
and Goswami et al. [186] have been reported only upto 5 bar cham-
ber pressure. It remains to be seen whether the trend of the pressure
exponent, b will remain the same or change significantly if the val-
ues of b are obtained from a larger range of pressures.

indirect (obtained using the power law correlation using Eq. (12)
with reported S0
L and b, open symbols). For the same measurement
technique with stretch corrected data, indirect data is slightly higher
than the direct data. There exists a scatter in the stretch corrected
data compared to the flat flame data obtained using the heat flux
method. A reasonably good agreement can be seen between various
experiments and computations for all mixtures. All the mechanisms
have some differences for lean mixture but predict almost same val-
ues for rich mixtures even at higher pressures.

at 373 K and 443 K for two different pressures of 2 atm and 5 atm
over a range of equivalence ratios respectively. There are some dis-

crepancies in the data reported here for all mixtures. Stretch cor-
rected data with linear extrapolation model are higher compared to
the non-linear extrapolation data for Hu et al. [106]. Non-linear
stretch correction direct data is found to be in good agreement with
flat flame indirect data from Dirrenberger et al. [301]. The predic-
tions show difference for lean mixtures and matches well for rich
mixtures. However, mechanisms under-predict the laminar burning
velocities for rich mixtures compared to experimental results for all
temperature and pressures.

4.3.4. Laminar burning velocity of methane+air mixtures at very high
pressures

The LBV at higher pressures is indeed of practical importance in
various combustion systems such as IC engines and gas turbine com-
bustors. However, very limited data is available for comparison pur-
pose above 0.5 MPa pressure, even for the most studied fuel such as
methane. The data of Gu et al. [98] and Rozenchan et al. [99] using
linear extrapolation for stretch correction compares well with the
predictions of various kinetic models at 10 and 20 atm pressure as
seen in Fig. 45. All the data available above 20 atm for methane + air
mixtures is obtained through spherical flame method using pres-
sure-time record without stretch correction. Elia et al. [386] reported
a single magnitude of pressure exponent lean, stoichiometric, and
rich mixtures. However, their data at 30 atm and 70 atm conditions.
Data reported by other researchers are significantly higher than the
kinetic model prediction as shown in Fig. 45.

4.3.5. Sensitivity of pressure and temperature exponent values to initial
conditions

To understand the effect of initial mixture conditions on the
value of temperature and pressure exponent, the variation of these
exponents on the given range is shown in Fig. 46. The pressure expo-
nent, b is extracted using a power-law correlation over various ini-
tial pressure ranges (1(cid:1)5 atm to 1(cid:1)70 atm) using GRI mech 3.0 for
stoichiometric methane + air mixture. Similarly, the temperature
exponent, a is extracted using a power-law correlation over various
initial temperature ranges (300(cid:1)400 K to 300(cid:1)600 K). The magni-
tudes of temperature exponent (a) and pressure exponents (b) are
least dependent on the temperature and pressure range respectively,
over which the measurements using various methods have been
reported by researchers. For instance, the LBVs estimated at 70 atm
using the pressure exponents obtained using the pressure exponent,
b with two different pressure ranges (1(cid:1)5 atm and 1(cid:1)20 atm are
6.18 and 6.78 cm/s respectively) differ by less than 1 cm/s. Similarly,
the LBVs estimated at a mixture temperature of 600 K using the tem-
perature exponents, a obtained with two different temperature
ranges (300(cid:1)500 K and 300(cid:1)600 K are 118.2 and 122.8 cm/s, respec-
tively) differs by less than 5 cm/s.

Another important point to be noted that the variation in the LBV
at 300 K due to change in the range of these initial conditions is
less than 1 cm/s and compensates for the slight change in the values
of a and b exponent values to obtain accurate LBV magnitudes at
elevated temperature/pressure respectively.

4.3.6. Effects of dilution on laminar burning velocity of methane + air
flames

The modern combustion devices use staged combustion tech-
nique, which essentially utilizes the combustion products from pre-
vious stage of combustion with slightly lower mole fraction of
oxygen (»8 ¡ 10%), also called as vitiated air in the higher stages
[398,399]. Vitiated air generated from hydrocarbon fuels operating
at lean mixture conditions mainly contains N2, CO2, H2O (g) and O2.
In higher stages, fuels like natural gas or biogas where methane is
one of the chief constituents are used. Hence, the stability of a flame
anchored in vitiated air due to the injection of combustible mixture
with methane into it will be significantly affected by the presence of

multiple diluents. Hence, it is important to study the effect of indi-
vidual and multiple diluents on the combustion characteristics of
methane + air flames at different initial temperatures and pressures.
Therefore, in the present section, the data available in the literature
is critically reviewed.

Fig. 47 shows the effect of added nitrogen (to replace portion of
CH4-air mixture) on LBV of premixed methane + air + N2 mixtures
for different equivalence ratios. All the presented data in the figure
are corrected for flame stretch using linear extrapolation model. In
the literature, different ways were reported by the researchers to
prepare the diluted mixture. Hu et al. [400] and Liang et al. [401]
added N2 to the mixture by replacing portion of CH4 + air mixture.
Hermanns et al. [390] and Dyakov et al. [111] altered the mole frac-
tion of N2 in the mixture by increasing the mole fraction of N2 in
the air. Kishore et al. [402] added N2 to methane. For comparison,
the mole fraction of added N2 was recalculated from literature data
as XN2;added
similar to that of Section 4.2.4. The initial
temperature of Liang et al. [401] was 290 K and hence their data is
consistently lower than other data.

of GRI Mech 3.0 [268] overpredict the laminar burning velocities as
compared to the reported measurements. The disagreement
between the kinetic models and the measured data could be due to
the application of linear models of stretch extrapolation. The LBV of
methane + air + N2 is observed to decrease linearly with an increase
in with dilution content. This happens because of (a) a reduction in
flame temperature due to increase in mixture heat capacity and (b)
reduced competition for active radicals.

Fig. 48 shows the effect of addition of CO2 on the LBV of premixed
methane + air + CO2 mixtures at standard conditions obtained from
literature for different equivalence ratios at 300 K and 1 bar. For
comparison, the mole fraction of added CO2 was recalculated from
nCO2
literature data as XCO2;added

corrected for stretch effects using spherical flames with linear
extrapolation model. Scatter in the measurement data between dif-
ferent groups was well within the experimental uncertainties and
their comparison with model prediction using the detailed kinetic
models of GRI Mech 3.0 [268] and San Diego mech [335]. With
increase in the mole fraction of CO2 in the mixture, the LBV
decreased non-linearly. The reason could be (a) reduction in temper-
ature of the flame due to increase in specific heat capacity of mixture
as compared to N2 dilution and (b) it competes for active radicals
through CO + OH$CO2 + H reaction. Overall, it is difficult to present a
complete comparison between the predictions of kinetic models and
experimental data as only limited data are available in literature. A
systematic study is required to understand the effect of dilution
with different gases on the variation of LBV to enable better model
development.

The variation of the LBV for ethane + air mixtures at atmospheric
pressure and initial temperature of 300 K with mixture equivalence

with the experimental data.

Fig. 49 shows that the LBV of ethane + air mixtures is more con-
sistent compared to methane + air mixtures (Fig. 34) as it is evident
with less scatter in the reported data. The peak burning velocity is
observed to be »42 cm/s at slightly rich mixture (f = 1.1) in recent
experiments. The average LBV of stoichiometric mixture at standard
conditions is »40 cm/s. However, the maximum and minimum val-
ues (45 cm/s and 39 cm/s) at f = 1.1 were reported by Tseng et al.
[385], Hassan et al. [97], and Lowry et al. [406]. Tseng et al. [385] and
Hassan et al. [97] used spherical flame method with linear extrapola-
tion for stretch corrections. Jomaas et al. [404] and Lowry et al. [406]
also used linear stretch correction in spherically propagating flames.
Aung et al. [96] updated laminar burning velocities originally mea-
sured by Tseng et al. [385]. However, these updated values were
lower than all other experimental data reported in literature. Work-
ing with ultra-low strain rates, Vagelopoulos et al. [110] found
slightly lower values compared to their earlier data (Egolfopoulos
et al.) [258]. In the recent work, Park et al. [408] reported further
lower magnitudes. Significant amount of data using heat-flux
method [183,246,402,403,405,407] has also been reported,
for
which no stretch correction is required.

Fig. 50 shows the influence of various stretch correction techni-
ques on laminar burning velocities of ethane + air mixtures. The
color codes denote the measurement method and stretch-correction
approach implemented by respective researchers: green (cid:1) spherical
flame method with linear model (LM) suggested by Markstein [73];
red (cid:1) stagnation flame method with linear model (LM) originated
from Wu and Law [34]; orange (cid:1) stagnation flame method with
non-linear extrapolation (NLM) based on Wang et al. [174]. A close
scrutiny of the data shows that significant differences still exist in
the magnitudes of laminar burning velocities, when compared with
different techniques. Particularly, the difference between the data of
Hassan et al. [97] (spherical flame method) using linear extrapola-
tion model and Park et al. [408] (counterflow flame method) using
non-linear extrapolation model is significant.

To avoid the impact of stretch correction for comparing the
experimental data, a comparison of measurements reported with
flat non-stretched flames was attempted. Fig. 51 shows a compari-
son of the literature data from heat flux method [246,402,407] in
comparison with non-linear stretch corrected data reported by Park
et al. [408]. The predictions from various kinetic models are also

shown [329,335,336]. There is a good agreement between the
computational predictions of these detailed mechanisms over the
complete range of equivalence ratios. However, all the investigated
kinetic mechanisms over-predict the burning velocities of lean mix-
tures as compared to experimental data. San Diego mech [335] pre-
dicts slightly lower values compared to other mechanisms for highly
rich mixtures.

There is no experimental data of LBV available at higher mixture
temperatures to derive the values of temperature exponent, and
show the dependence of LBV of ethane + air mixtures with tempera-
ture. Therefore, the related data of temperature exponent, a, and
comparison of LBV at higher mixtures could not be presented.

4.4.2. Pressure dependence of ethane + air flames

Fig. 52 shows the LBV of ethane + air mixtures at elevated pres-
sures of 2(cid:1)5 atm. A good agreement between the computational
predictions and experimental data can be seen at 2 atm mixture
pressure except for highly rich mixtures. A scatter of §2 cm/s is
observed at 2 atm. The disagreement exaggerates at higher mixture
pressures and scatter reaches§ 4 cm/s. Kinetic model predictions
necessitate a sincere redressal of the issue at higher pressures, par-
ticularly for lean mixtures, since they predict significantly higher
values of laminar burning velocities for higher pressures compared
to the experimental data.

Fig. 53 shows the variation of the pressure exponent with equiva-
lence ratio for ethane + air mixtures which was only reported by
Goswami et al. [246]. The pressure exponent, b data were also
derived from the experimental data of Hassan et al. [97], Jomaas
et al. [404], and Lowry et al. [406] and plotted in Fig. 51. Except Has-
san et al. [97], all other experimental results show a nonlinear varia-
tion of pressure exponent, b with equivalence ratio, with a
maximum value existing for slightly rich mixtures.

A comparison between the experimental data and predictions
using detailed kinetic models is also shown in Fig. 53. The predicted
values of pressure exponent, b exhibit a qualitative similarity with
the experimental values of pressure exponents. There is good
agreement between the predictions of different mechanisms with
the data of Jomaas et al. [404]. The values of the pressure exponent
reported by Goswami et al. [246] for lean mixtures and by Lowry
et al. [406] for rich mixtures are much lower and higher respec-
tively, when compared to the mechanism predictions. However, it
is to be noted that the uncertainty in the pressure exponent, b, are
significantly higher for the measurements reported with spherical
vessel method by Jomaas et al. [404] and Hassan et al. [97] com-
pared to the measurements using the heat-flux method (Goswami
et al.) [246]. Overall, more focused experiments are recommended
to understand the variation of pressure exponent, b with mixture
equivalence ratio. An overall comparison of Figs. 52 and 53 shows
that the comparison between the measured and predicted values of
laminar burning velocities and pressure exponent, b is significantly
different. Therefore, more experimental investigations and further
model validation is required to accurately predict the pressure
dependence of the laminar burning velocities at higher mixture
temperatures.

ratio, f is shown in Fig. 54. The color codes represent the literature

ing velocities using several detailed kinetic schemes available in lit-
erature: San Diego mech [335], Qin mech [338], and USC mech II
[336] for comparison purpose with the experimental data.

Fig. 54 indicates that the peak value of LBV for propane + air mix-
tures occur for slightly rich mixture and it decreases on both sides of
the peak value. Good amount of scatter could be seen in the reported
data at all equivalence ratios. At stoichiometric conditions, the LBV
of propane + air mixtures seems to be in the range of 38(cid:1)44 cm/s
with the exception of Tseng et al. [385] who reported a very low
value of just 32 cm/s. Huzayyin et al. [411] reported the highest
value of 45 cm/s at f = 1.1. They used spherical flame method and
corrected for stretch using linear scheme. Takizawa et al. [101],
Huzayyin et al. [411], Razus et al. [413], and Razus et al. [415] also
measured laminar burning velocities using spherical flame method.
They derived LBV from pressure-time history while did not perform
stretch corrections.

Yu et al. [384], and Egolfopoulos et al. [258] used stagnation
flame method with linear stretch corrections to measure the laminar
burning velocities. Vagelopoulos et al. [7] improved the accuracy of
stagnation flame method by increasing the separation distance
between the nozzles and measured weakly strained burning veloci-
ties and subsequently reduced the errors arising during stretch
extrapolation. Vagelopolous and Egolfopoulos [9] adapted stagna-
tion flame method and used larger separation distance between the
burner and stagnation plate. Then, they allowed the positively
strained flames at higher speeds to transit to negatively strained
conical flames by further reducing the exit velocities of burner. Dur-
ing the transition, they identified a quasi-steady location at which
the flame achieved a near
zero strain rate limit. Above

improvements, ensured that the obtained LBV from stagnation flame
method was less sensitive to errors due to extrapolation which can
be visualized from Fig. 54. The measurements using the heat flux
method [36,183,246,407,414], annular diverging channel method
[114] and annular step-wise method [93] do not require any stretch
corrections as the flames were planar and propagate normal to the
combustible mixture.

Fig. 55 further summarizes available stretch-corrected LBV litera-
ture data as a function of mixture equivalence ratio and measured
with spherical flame method and stagnation flame method at stan-
dard conditions along with modeling results. In the figure, the lami-
nar burning velocities measured using the above mentioned
methods but reported without stretch corrections were excluded.

Fig. 55 shows that stretch correction reduced the scatter in the
unstretched burning velocities. The unstretched LBV measured by
Tang et al. [412] using spherical flame method was systematically
higher than rest of the data for conditions of f > 1.0. They used lin-
ear scheme for zero stretch extrapolation. For propane + air mix-
tures, no unstretched burning velocity data is available in the

literature measured with spherical flame method and corrected for
stretch using contemporary non-linear extrapolation schemes.
Extrapolation of stretched burning velocity measured with spherical
flame method using linear schemes provides slightly lower values
for lean propane + air mixtures and slightly higher values for rich
compared to nonlinear extrapolation
propane + air mixtures
schemes. It is important to mention that the unstretched burning
velocity measured with stagnation flame method and stretch cor-
rected using non-linear extrapolation scheme are higher for lean
mixtures and lower for rich mixtures than linear extrapolation data.
To avoid the impact of the choice of stretch correction, the com-
parison of LBV of propane + air mixtures measured using non-
stretched planar flames could be handy. Fig. 56 shows the recent
burning velocity data measured with the heat-flux method
[246,407] and diverging channel method [114] in comparison with
the stretch corrected burning velocity values using non-linear
schemes [23]. Also shown are the predicted values of burning veloci-
ties using different detailed kinetic models available in the literature
such as: San Diego mech [335], Qin mech [338], and USC mech II
[336] . The agreement between the values of burning velocities
obtained from simulations using different detailed kinetic schemes
and proper stretch corrected measurements is quite good over the
reported range of equivalence ratios as shown in the figure.

4.5.2. Temperature dependence of propane + air flames

Fig. 57 shows the variation of the temperature exponent, a for
propane + air mixtures extracted from both measurements and sim-
ulations. In the figure, error bars are shown for the literature experi-
mental data that reported uncertainties. Present predicted values of
a are estimated from simulations obtained for a temperature range
of 300(cid:1)600 K. Large scatter can be observed among the reported
experimental data. A slight decrease in a with equivalence ratio
(0.8(cid:1)1.2) was reported by Metghalchi and Keck [158]. The values of
a reported by Takizawa et al. [101] monotonically decrease with an
increase in the equivalence ratio (0.7(cid:1)1.4). Razus et al. [413]
observed a scattered non-linear variation, in which temperature
exponent, a reduces with equivalence ratio. Their values of a for
richer mixtures are significantly lower than the predictions and
other reported measurements. However, in their subsequent study
[415], they reported the values of a to decrease till stoichiometry

and further increase for rich mixtures as shown in Fig. 57. Akram
et al. [114] confirmed that a minimum value of temperature expo-
nent, a exists for slightly rich mixtures, and increases on both sides
of the mixture equivalence ratio range. Similar observations have
been made for methane + air mixtures by various researchers as dis-
cussed earlier in Sections 4.2.2 and 4.3.2 respectively [414].

Large discrepancies observed in the values of temperature expo-
nent, a could be due to the use of different measurement methods
and data extraction techniques. Metghalchi and Keck [158], Taki-
zawa et al. [101], Razus et al. [413], and Razus et al. [415] used spher-
ical flame method without stretch corrections. The observation of
stretch free measurement data of Akram et al. [114] and present
simulated data with different kinetic models clearly indicates that
the scatter is mainly due to non-consideration of stretch effects.

Fig. 58 shows the LBV of propane + air mixtures at ambient pres-
sure and different mixture temperatures of 370 K, 500 K, and 650 K.
It is important to mention that the literature data reported without
stretch correction is not included in the Fig. 56. The data shown in
the figure can be classified as direct (as reported in literature, filled
symbols) and indirect (calculated from power law correlation using
Eq. (8) along with the values of S0
L and a, reported in the respective
literature, open symbols). Laminar burning velocity at 343 K, 370 K
and 390 K reported by Veloo and Egolfopoulos [416], Tang et al.
[417] and Gong et al. [418] respectively are also shown for compari-
son. Laminar burning velocity increases with mixture temperature
for all the reported conditions. A reasonably good agreement can be
observed between different measurement methods and simulations
at unburned gas temperatures of 370 K and 500 K. Computational
predictions at 500 K match well with the data of Zhao et al. [409]
and Akram et al. [114]. However, it is interesting to note that a sub-
stantial deviation between the measured burning velocity of Zhao
et al. [409] and simulations could be observed at 650 K. The disagree-
ment between various kinetic mechanisms is also notable at higher
mixture temperatures of 650 K. A rigorous analysis of both the exist-
ing kinetic mechanisms as well as experimental techniques is
required to further reduce the scatter at elevated temperatures.

4.5.3. Pressure dependence of propane + air flames

Fig. 59 shows variation of the pressure exponent, b with equiva-
lence ratio for propane + air mixtures reported in the literature.

234

A.A. Konnov et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 68 (2018) 197(cid:1)267

Significant difference in the values of b between the reported
measurements could be due to the use of different measurement
methods and data extraction techniques. Especially, the stretch
uncorrected data measured using spherical flame method and
reported by Metghalchi and Keck [158], Takizawa et al. [101] and
Razus et al. [413,415] showed large deviations. Stretch corrected
data (linear extrapolation) measured using spherical flame method
reported by Hassan et al. [97], Tang et al. [417] and Jomaas et al.
[404] (integral form of linear extrapolation) exhibits some differen-
ces, they are near to flat flame data of Goswami et al. [246]. Ongoing
discussion clearly indicates that the flame stretch significantly
affects the values of pressure exponent and hence, it is essential to
perform stretch corrections wherever it is required. Fig. 59 also
shows the comparison of the computational and experimental
results for pressure exponent variation. All the mechanisms predict
similar values of pressure exponent. A good agreement can be
observed between the predictions and flat flame data except for
very lean mixture conditions.

Fig. 60 shows the variation of LBV of propane + air mixtures with
equivalence ratio at elevated pressures of 2(cid:1)5 atm. The data shown
in the figure can be classified as direct (as reported in literature,
filled symbols) and indirect (calculated using power law correlation
with Eq. (12) along with the values of S0
L and b reported in the
respective literature, open symbols). There exists a scatter in the
stretch corrected data (spherical flame and counter flow flame
method) compared to the flat flame data using the heat flux method.
A reasonably good agreement can be seen between various experi-
ments and computations for lean and near stoichiometric mixtures.
All the mechanisms have some differences for lean mixtures, how-
ever, predict almost the same values with rich mixtures even at
higher pressures.

4.6. Laminar burning velocity of n-butane + air mixtures

4.6.1. Mixture dependence of n-butane + air flames

The laminar burning velocity of n-butane + air mixtures as a func-
tion of equivalence ratio, f at atmospheric pressure and initial tem-
perature of 300 K is shown in Fig. 61. The literature data is color
coded based on decade in which results were reported. It can be
observed that a maximum LBV for n-butane + air flames + at 1 atm
and 300 K is 42 cm/s. Large discrepancies for lean and near stoichio-
metric mixtures and reasonable consistency for very rich mixtures
except the data of Razus et al. [413] can be observed. Among the
data available, Sher and Ozdor [419] reported highest values. The
burning velocity data for very rich mixture using Spherical flame
method with no flame stretch corrections were obtained by Clarke
et al. [420], Marshall et al. [421], and Razus et al. [413] and the heat
flux method was used which does not require any stretch correc-
tions by Bosschaart and de Goey [183] and Dirrenberger et al. [407].

The stretch corrected burning velocity data for n-butane + air
flames are presented in Fig. 62. It should noted that data of Clarke
et al. [420], Marshall et al. [421], and Razus et al. [413] who have
used spherical flame method with p-t recordings have been
excluded. Also, modeling results obtained with two reaction mecha-
nisms: USC mech II [336] and San Diego mech [335] are shown in
the figure for comparison purpose. The color codes represents the
measurement method and stretch-correction approach imple-
mented: green (cid:1) spherical flame method with linear extrapolation
model; blue (cid:1) spherical flame method with non-linear extrapolation
model; red (cid:1) stagnation flame method with linear extrapolation
model; orange (cid:1) stagnation flame method with non-linear extrapo-
lation model.

Spherical flame method using flame radius versus time recording
with linear extrapolation by Wu et al [424]. and non-linear extrapo-
lation by Kelley et al. [86] and Tang et al. [423] was used for the mea-
surement of LBV of n-butane + air flames. It is interesting to note that

Metghalchi and Keck [158] and Takizawa et al. [101] have reported a
linear increase in the values of pressure exponent with an increase
in the equivalence ratio. A dispersed increase in pressure exponent,
b till stoichiometric mixture and then drop is reported by Razus
et al. [413]. However, the recent work of Razus [415] shows a reduc-
tion in the values of pressure exponent with an increase in equiva-
lence ratio as seen from Fig. 59. Goswami et al. [246] have shown a
nonlinear variation of pressure exponent with equivalence ratio and
their minimum value of b is observed at f = 1.1.

burning velocities with linear extrapolation model [424] are lower
than non-linear extrapolation data [86,423]. This is contrary to the
observations for the case of methane + air and other alkanes + air
flames, where lower values were reported for non-linear stretch
extrapolation models. Davis and Law [173] measured n-butane + air
LBV along with other hydrocarbon fuel + air mixtures using stagna-
tion flame method (twin flame in counterflow burner with particle
tracking and linear/non-linear extrapolation). They observed a dif-
ference of 2(cid:1)3 cm/s between linear and non-linear extrapolation.
Hirasawa et al. [422] used the same setup with DPIV technique and
non-linear extrapolation. They obtained comparatively lower values
for lean mixtures, and higher values for stoichiometric and rich mix-
tures. Recently Park et al. [23] reduced uncertainties related to coun-
terflow flame method and reported 3 cm/s lower values compared
to Davis and Law [173] data for near stoichiometric mixtures.

It can seen that stretch correction method has significant effect
on measured values of laminar burning velocities and hence, com-
parison of the burning velocity measurements using flat non-
stretched flames of n-butane + air mixtures could be most useful.
Fig. 63 shows recent data from the heat flux method reported by Dir-
renberger et al. [407] along with non-linear stretch corrected data of
Kelley and law [86] and Park et al. [23]. Also the predictions from
two detailed kinetic models available in literature: USC mech II
[336] and San Diego mech [335] are included. The computational
predictions of both detailed kinetic mechanisms are in good agree-
ment with experimental data over the range of equivalence ratio.
The predictions are also consistent with the recent experimental
data for rich mixtures. However, the computational predictions
are higher than experimental burning velocities for all the lean
mixtures.

4.6.2. Temperature dependence of n-butane + air flames

Temperature dependence of n-butane + air flames has been ana-
lyzed using temperature exponent. The variation of the temperature
exponent with equivalence ratio is shown in Fig. 64. Clarke et al.
[420] reported the temperature exponent values as 1.45 for stoichio-
metric n-butane + air mixture. A slight decrease in a value from lean
to rich mixtures was observed by Marshall et al. [421]. In another
study, Sher and Ozdor [419] proposed a linear correlation, in which

temperature exponent, a increases significantly with mixture equiv-
alence ratio as shown in Fig. 64. Both USC mech II [336] and San
Diego mech [335] predictions give a non-linear trend with a mini-
mum value existing for slightly rich mixtures for which LBV is maxi-
mum. This is usual variation of temperature exponent, observed for
other hydrocarbon mixtures discussed earlier [372]. The disagree-
ment observed between the temperature exponents of various
experiments and computational predictions, can be explained by the
fact that all experimental determinations were performed without
stretch correction. This further substantiates the fact that the
removal

[413,420,421] from the data used for model validation is justifiable.

The LBV of n-butane + air mixtures for various equivalence ratios
at mixture temperature near 343 K and atmospheric pressure is
shown in Fig. 65. Marshall et al. [421] data at given temperature and
pressure was extracted from a power law correlation presented
based on their experimental data. Veloo et al. [416] reported burning
velocities at 343 K using stagnation flame method and non-linear
stretch correction model proposed by Wang et al. [174]. Sher and
Ozdor [419] used the flat flame method and studied the effect of
temperature (270(cid:1)410 K) and hydrogen addition on variation of
laminar burning velocities of n-butane + air flames. Their data at
310 K itself compares with the data of Veloo et al. [416] at 434 K. The
higher magnitudes could be due to their higher burning velocities at
ambient conditions and higher temperature exponents compared to
computational predictions. The computational predictions of USC
mech II [336] and San Diego mech [335] are in very good agreement
with each other and with the stretch-corrected measurements of
Veloo et al. [416].

4.6.3. Pressure dependence of n-butane + air flames

Pressure dependence of n-butane + air flames can be analyzed
using pressure exponent. The variation of the pressure exponent val-
ues with equivalence ratio is shown in Fig. 66. Also computed pres-
sure exponents using USC mech II [336] and San Diego mech [335]
are shown in Fig. 66. Clark et al. [420] reported a value of the pres-
sure exponent as ¡0.225 for stoichiometric n-butane + air mixture
based on the measurements without any correction for the flame
stretch. A slight decrease (near constant) in b from lean to rich

mixtures was observed by Marshall et al. [421]. Both San Diego mech
[335] and USC mech II [336] prediction are in better agreement with
each other and give a non-linear trend with maximum value existing
for slightly rich mixtures. The pressure exponents of various experi-
ments [420,421] were obtained from the data without stretch cor-
rection implemented for extracting the LBV which has led to a
significant disagreement with the predictions of detailed kinetic
models. This further substantiates the removal of the relevant burn-
ing velocity measurements [420] from the data used for model vali-
dation.

The laminar burning velocity of n-butane + air at 3 atm and 450 K
is shown in Fig. 67. Farrell et al. [425] measured the burning velocity
using pressure-time recording in spherical flames. Their experimen-
tal LBV data are relatively high compared to the data reported by
Marshall et al. [421] through their experimental correlation. Both

have not considered correction for stretch effects and a significant
disagreement can be observed for the data reported by both groups.
Computational predictions are slightly lower compared to experi-
mental measurements reported by Farrell et al. [425] for lean mix-
tures and slightly lower compared to experimental measurements
reported by Marshall et al. [421] for rich mixtures.

Considering the above issues with the unavailability of measure-
ments without stretch corrections and with flat flames, it is impor-
tant to readdress the investigations at elevated pressures and
temperatures for n-butane + air flames.

measurement data are available in the literature for these condi-
tions. Davis and Law 1998 [426] measured n-pentane + air LBV using
stagnation flame method (twin flame in counterflow burner with
particle tracking and linear/non-linear extrapolation). Dirrenberger
et al. 2015 [427] have recently reported the measured LBV using
heat flux method. Both these experimental data complement each
other.

Numerical predictions of both detailed mechanisms are in good
agreement with experimental data for lean and near-stoichiometric
mixtures. The predictions are also consistent with recent experi-
mental data for these mixtures. However, the computational predic-
tions of recently published model on pentane isomers (NUI-PI-
Modify mechanism) [340] are significantly lower than experimen-
tally measured burning velocities for highly rich mixtures.

4.7.2. Temperature dependence of n-pentane + air flames

The values of temperature exponent, a for n-pentane + air flames
have been reported by Dirrenberger et al. 2015 only and are shown
in Fig. 69. The trends of temperature exponent, a using the predic-
tions of both Jet Surf 2.0 mech [339] and NUI-PI-Modify mech [340]
also conform a qualitative match with the experiments measure-
ments as shown in Fig. 4.x.2.

The laminar burning velocity of n-pentane + air mixtures for
various equivalence ratios at 353 K mixture temperature and
atmospheric pressure is shown in Fig. 70. The LBVs at 358 K and
398 K reported by Dirrenberger et al. 2015 [427] are also shown in
the figure for comparison purpose. The data obtained using stag-
nation flame method with non-linear stretch correction Ji et al.
[180] are slightly higher than the data obtained with spherical
flame method with both linear (Kelley et al. [428]) and non-linear
(Kelley et al. [428], Cheng et al. [340]) stretch extrapolation. The
computational predictions of NUI-PI-Modify mech. [340] are in
good agreement with the measurements of Dirrenberger et al.
[427] using heat-flux method at both the mixture temperatures.
For rich mixtures, the predictions of NUI-PI-Modify mech [340] are
significantly higher than the results of spherical flame and stagna-
tion flame method.

4.7.3. Pressure dependence of n-pentane + air flames

The variation of the pressure exponent, b is shown in Fig. 71.
The experimental data is extracted from the limited results of Dir-
renberger et al. 2015. The obtained values of b are in good

qualitative agreement with both the kinetic model predictions. A
comparison of LBVs of n-pentane + air at 353 K mixture tempera-
ture and various pressures of 2 atm, 5 atm, and 10 atm is shown in
Fig. 72. The reported data of Kelley et al. 2011 [428] is slightly
higher compared to the data reported by Dirrenberger et al. 2015
[427] at 353 K and 2 atm conditions. The computational predictions
of NUI-PI-Modify mech [340] are in good agreement with the
experimental data for lean mixtures. A significant difference
between the mechanism predictions and experimental measure-
ments can be seen for rich mixtures.

Considering the disagreement in the magnitudes of these two dif-
ferent mechanisms specifically for highly rich mixtures, a sincere
effort is required to update these mechanisms. For the better devel-
opment of these mechanisms, more experiments are required at
high pressures and temperatures with n-pentane + air mixtures
using different measurement techniques.

4.8. Laminar burning velocity of DME + air mixtures

4.8.1. Mixture dependence of DME + air flames

With the recent advancements toward the development of alter-
native fuels, dimethyl ether (DME, CH3OCH3) has emerged as one of
the prominent clean fuels [436]. It is the simplest of ethers with high
reactivity due to higher cetane number ((cid:3)60), low boiling point
(¡25 °C) and low auto-ignition temperature. Dimethyl ether (DME)
is one of the simplest organic and oxygenated compounds that
exhibits an emblematic negative temperature coefficient (NTC)
behavior [437(cid:1)439] and multi-stage ignition [440(cid:1)442]. Various
combustion characteristics such as ignition delay and LBV of
DME + air mixtures find their importance in its deployment as a per-
spective fuel for various practical applications.

The variation of the LBV of DME + air mixtures at atmospheric
pressure and initial temperature of 300 K with mixture equiva-
lence ratio, f is shown in Fig. 73. The predictions from various
detailed kinetic models [329,341(cid:1)343,443] are also shown in
the figure for comparison purpose with the experimental data
[163,174,267,392,424,429(cid:1)435].

significant disagreements

A significant scatter can be observed among the experimental
data reported for DME + air mixtures at ambient conditions. The dis-
persion in the experimental data is comparatively higher for rich
mixtures. A significant disagreement (»50 (cid:1) 80%) in the measured
LBV can be seen for Huang et al. [431] and Zhao et al. [342], using
spherical flame and stagnation flame method, respectively. For rich
DME + air mixtures, Zhao et al. 2004 [430] reported higher values,
whereas Huang et al. [431] reported comparatively lower values.
(»70%) can be observed
Similarly,
between Qin and Ju [163] and Huang et al. [431], even though spher-
ical flame method with linear extrapolation technique was used in
both studies. Observation of a maximum burning velocity for lean
mixtures by Huang et al. [431] should be considered cautiously. De
Vries et al. [433] analyzed the data reported by Huang et al. [431]
and Chen et al. [432]. They pointed out that large discrepancies exist
in the density ratios used by Huang et al. [431] for certain mixtures.
For example, burned and unburned LBV ratio of 13.6 was reported at
0.15 MPa pressure. The results of Chen et al. [432] are similar to
those reported by Huang et al. [431] with an exception for rich

mixtures. Chen et al. [432] later updated their data in their recent
work [392]. Considering the huge scatter in some of the reported
data [430(cid:1)432] and its criticism by de Vries et al. [433] for reasons
discussed above, these data can be excluded from further compari-
son in the following sections. Differences in the computational pre-
dictions using different mechanisms are evident when compared
with these scattered experimental data. The LLNL mechanism highly
over-predicts the laminar burning velocities as seen in Fig. 73.

Fig. 74 summarizes the available stretch-corrected data (exclud-
ing Daly et al. 2001 [429] pressure (cid:1) time recordings) at standard
conditions and modeling results obtained with various reaction
mechanisms for comparison purpose. The color codes denote the
measurement method and stretch-correction approach imple-
mented as follows: green (cid:1) spherical flame method with linear
model of Markstein [73]; red (cid:1) stagnation flame method with linear
model (LM) originated from Wu and Law [34]; orange (cid:1) stagnation
flame method with non-linear extrapolation (NLM) based on the
work of Wang et al. [174].

Constant volume spherical flame method using flame radius ver-
sus time recording with linear extrapolation was used [29,392,434]
for the measurement of LBV of DME + air flames. Interestingly, burn-
ing velocities measured by the same group [103] with same mea-
surement
technique and linear extrapolation method differs
significantly as can be seen in Fig. 74. Qin and Ju [163] used spherical
flame method with pressure-release technique and linear extrapola-
tion model. In another study, de Vries et al. [433] used a linear corre-
lation between LBV and flame radius data. This linear extrapolation
technique was suggested by Brown et al. [444] and later used by
Law and co-workers [99,162]. Laminar burning velocity of DME + air
mixtures using stagnation flame method with a non-linear extrapo-
lation technique was reported by Wang et al. [174,341].

To avoid the impact of stretch correction, comparison of the data
from the measured laminar burning velocities using non-stretched
flat flames could be more useful. Fig. 75 shows the recently reported
data from externally preheated diverging channel method reported
by Varghese et al. [267] and its comparison with the most recent
non-linear stretch corrected data of Wang et al. [174]. The predic-
tions from various detailed kinetic models are also shown for com-
parison with experimental data in the figure. It is interesting to note

tions of various detailed mechanisms such as Zhao et al. mech [342]
and Wang et al. mech [341]over the complete range of equivalence
ratios. The predictions are also consistent with recent experimental
data reported by Wang et al. [174] with stagnation flame method
and non-linear extrapolation of stretch effects.

4.8.2. Temperature dependence of DME + air flames

The only experimental data available for DME + air mixtures at
elevated temperatures and temperature exponent, a, are recently
reported by Varghese et al. [267]. As shown in Fig. 76, the tempera-
ture exponent, a varies non-linearly with mixture equivalence ratio.
The predicted variation of the temperature exponent, a with Zhao

et al. mechanism [342] is in good agreement with the experimental
values of Varghese et al. [267].

The laminar burning velocities obtained using Eq. (8) along with
the values of temperature exponent, a and LBV So
L at higher mixture
temperatures of 400 K and 500 K are compared with predictions
using different kinetic mechanisms as shown in Fig. 77. The predic-
tions of Wang et al. mechanism [341] and Zhao et al. mechanism
[342] are in good agreement with the experimental data of Varghese
et al. [267]. It is to be noted that the predictions of Aramco mech 1.3
[329] and LLNL mech [343] are significantly higher than the mea-
sured burning velocities at higher temperatures, particularly for stoi-
chiometric and rich mixtures.

4.8.3. Pressure dependence of DME + air flames

The studies on understanding the effect of pressure on laminar
burning velocities of DME + air mixtures are very few. Fig. 78 shows

different approaches and different mechanisms, a significant dis-
agreement between the measured and predicted values of laminar
burning velocities can be observed at higher pressures. This necessi-
tates a sincere re-addressal of both experimental and kinetic models
at elevated pressures as well as at elevated temperatures.

4.9. Laminar burning velocity of liquid alkane + air flames

4.9.1. Laminar burning velocity of n-heptane + air mixtures

4.9.1.1. Mixture dependence of n-heptane + air flames. n-heptane fuel
holds great significance as it is used as a test component in anti-
knock test engines with an assigned value of zero point on octane
scale and 100 points assigned to isooctane, also known as octane
number. The laminar burning velocity for n-heptane + air mixtures
has been widely studied by many researchers as it is simplest single-
component reference liquid fuel. The variation of the LBV with mix-
ture equivalence ratio, f is shown in Fig. 80. Only post-stretch meas-
urements are shown by color coded decades since the initial work of
Davis and Law [445]. Predictions from various detailed mechanisms
of LLNL mech 3.1 [344], Smallbone et al. [346], Jet Surf 2.0 mech
[339], PoliMi mech 1 [345] are shown as lines for comparison with
the experimental data. It is to be noted that a significant scatter
exists in the reported experimental data as well in mechanism pre-
dictions. The disagreement further worsens for rich mixtures. It is to
be noted that maximum burning velocity is observed for slightly
rich mixtures (at f = 1.1). A large scatter (about § 4 cm/s) can be
seen in Fig. 80 for slightly rich mixtures compared to lean and very
rich mixtures.

Kumar et al. [448] measured the LBV of n-heptane + air mixtures
using stagnation flame method with both linear and non-linear
extrapolation techniques. However, they reported only linearly
extrapolated data citing that linear extrapolation technique gives
3 cm/s higher magnitudes of LBV as compared to non-linear extrapo-
lation technique. Fig. 81 shows the LBV of n-heptane + air mixtures
techniques and different
obtained with various measurement
stretch corrections strategies. The color codes used in this and fol-
lowing figures denote the measurement method and stretch-

the variation of the pressure exponent, b, reported by Qin and Ju
[163], and de Vries et al. 2011 [433]. The values of the pressure expo-
nent, b reported by these researchers are obtained using spherical
flame method with two different approaches (pressure-release
method with linear extrapolation method by Qin and Ju [163], and
constant volume method with linear extrapolation technique by de
Vries et al. [433]). Both experiments exhibit significant differences in
reported b values. Pressure exponent, b varies non-linearly with
mixture equivalence ratios with a maximum value observed for near
stoichiometric mixtures. A qualitative comparison between the
experimentally measured and predicted values can be seen. The var-
iation of the pressure exponent, b predicted with different mecha-
nisms also shows similar trend, however, significant differences in
the magnitude can be observed between them.

A comparison of the laminar burning velocities of DME + air mix-
ture at a higher pressure of 10 bar is shown in Fig. 79. Due to signifi-
cant differences in the pressure exponents, b reported by two

flame method with linear model (LM) suggested by Markstein [73];
red (cid:1) stagnation flame method with linear model (LM) originated
from Wu and Law [34]; black (cid:1) heat-flux method. The measure-
ments of Kwon et al. [446] were carried out in a spherical chamber
for n-heptane + air mixtures using high-speed photography. The
reported values are significantly lower than the recent data in the lit-
erature. Similarly, the measurements of Kumar et al. [448] using
stagnation flame method report significantly higher values for stoi-
chiometric and slightly rich mixtures. Kwon et al. [446] and Kumar
et al. [448] show significantly different values of LBV perhaps due to
linear extrapolation approach used to extract LBV values from the
measured data.

The data obtained from the heat-flux method recently has been
included in the figure to show their direct comparison with remain-
ing data and mechanism predictions. It is interesting to note that the
experimental data obtained using stagnation flame method with lin-
ear extrapolation [445,447,450] for rich mixtures compares well
with the heat-flux method based measurements of Dirrenberger
et al.
[149] and predictions of various detailed mechanisms
[339,344(cid:1)346]. It is important to note here that no experimental
data with non-linear extrapolation is reported for n-heptane + air
flames. It requires sincere care toward the extrapolation technique
to reduce the existing differences between the data obtained from
stagnation flame method and spherical flame method.

4.9.1.2. Temperature dependence of n-heptane+air flames. The varia-
tion of the temperature exponent, a with mixture equivalence ratio
is shown in Fig. 82. The experimental data reported by Sileghem
et al. [148] and Dirrenberger et al. [149] using heat-flux method has
been reported and compared with the predictions of various mecha-
nisms. The predictions of these models [339,344,345] compare rela-
tively well with each other for the given mixture equivalence ratio
range of 0.7 (cid:1) f (cid:1) 1.5. However, a small over prediction can be
noted as compared to experimental measurements. Overall, various
mechanisms are able to predict the trend of variation of a with
equivalence ratio reasonably well.

Fig. 83 shows the comparison of the LBV with equivalence ratio at
mixture temperatures of 360, 400 and 470 K with a select set of

experimental data. The experimental data of Sileghem et al. [148]
and Dirrenberger et al. [149] are extrapolated to higher mixture
temperatures using Eq. (8) with LBV values, So
L at 300 K and tempera-
ture exponent, a values reported in Fig. 83. It is to be noted that the
data reported by Smallbone et al. [346] using stagnation flame
method with linear extrapolation model and Kelly et al. [451] using
spherically propagating flames with non-linear extrapolation model
for stretch correction under-predict the variation of LBV at 360 K
mixture temperature. The values of Kumar et al. [448] and Chong
et al. [450] using linear extrapolation model are considerably higher
than the mechanism predictions at various mixture temperatures
varying up to 470 K. The data of Ji et al. [180] using stagnation flame
method with non-linear extrapolation model are able to show a vari-
ation close to the kinetic model preditions. Indirectly obtained val-
ues of Sileghem et al. [148] and Dirrenberger et al. [149] using Eq.
(8) compares well with the predictions of different models
[339,344,345,347] for lean mixtures at 350(cid:1)360 K temperatures as
shown in Fig. 76(a). However, the measurements of Smallbone et al.
[346], and Kelly et al. [451] are significantly lower than the mecha-
nisms predictions and other experimental data. The measurements
of Ji et al. [180] using a non-linear model for stretch extrapolation
show slightly lower values for rich mixture conditions. The data
obtained using the heat-flux method compare reasonable well for
the whole range of mixture equivalence ratios [148,149]. A small
and noticeable difference between the measurements of Sileghem
et al. [148] and Dirrenberger et al. [149] using the heat-flux method
can be observed at both lean (lower values than predictions) and
rich mixtures (higher values than predictions) for complete range of
mixture equivalence ratios. The disagreement perhaps comes due to
the fact that the values of temperature exponent, a reported in
Fig. 82 are obtained from a limited set of experimental data with
mixture temperature varying upto 398 K. The discrepancy between
the experimental measurements and mechanism predictions contin-
ues to increase with mixture temperature as clear from Fig. 76(a)
and (b). At mixture temperatures of 400 K and 470 K, the measure-
ments using stagnation flame method [448,450] are significantly
higher than the mechanism predictions [339,344,345]. Overall, the
measurements using the heat-flux method give a better agreement
at higher mixture temperatures as compared to other techniques.
However, the disagreement continues to increase both in the experi-
techniques as well as
mental data obtained using different

comparison in the figure. The predictions of Jetsurf [339] and Chaos
et al. [347] mechanism compare well with a limited data of Kelly
et al. [451] at 10 atm pressure and 353 K mixture temperature. Due
to insufficient data, it is not possible to present and compare the var-
iation of pressure exponent, b with mixture equivalence ratio for n-
heptane + air mixtures. A comparison of LBV at higher pressure of 10
atm and 25 atm with the predictions of LLNL mechanism [344] is
shown in Fig. 85. The measured LBV at 10 atm pressure shows good
match at intermediate mixture equivalence ratios. The predicted
burning velocities at 25 atm pressure are significantly higher than
the measured burning velocities.

To briefly summarize, for n-heptane + air mixtures, experimental
data compares well with certain mechanisms up to 360 K mixture
temperature. Following issues needs to be considered in the future
work.

(i) To understand the variation of temperature exponent, a with
equivalence ratio, very limited data [148,149] with the heat-flux
method exist. The comparison of the extrapolated laminar burn-
ing velocities at higher mixture temperatures (500(cid:1)600 K) with
the predictions of various mechanisms becomes relatively poor.
(ii) Significant disagreement exists between the experimental data
obtained using different methods such as heat-flux, stagnation
flame, and spherical flame method. The issue need to be revis-
ited from the perspective of higher mixture Lewis number of n-
heptane + air mixtures and accurate prediction of dependence of
LBV on non-linear stretch effects.

(iii) Insufficient data are available at high pressures to determine the
pressure exponent, b and check the validity of the existing
mechanisms at higher pressures.

important component of gasoline, frequently used in large propor-
tions to increase the knock resistance of surrogates of fossil fuels
with an assigned octane rating of 100. The laminar burning velocity
for isooctane + air mixtures as single component liquid fuel is shown
in Fig. 86 for standard conditions of 1 atm pressure and 300 K

predictions from different mechanism due to different values of
temperature exponent, a. This indicates that more research is
required on the direct measurement of laminar burning velocities at
higher mixture temperatures to fine tune the existing chemical
kinetic mechanisms.

4.9.1.3. Pressure dependence of n-heptane + air flames. A very limited
set of data for LBV variation is available at higher pressures and spec-
ified mixture temperatures. Therefore, it becomes very difficult to
present a fair comparison between the experimental data and pre-
dictions of different mechanisms. Fig. 84 shows the variation of the
LBV of n-heptane + air mixtures at 2 and 10 atm with 353 K mixture
temperature.

The data of Kelly et al. [451] and Mannaa et al. [452] compares
well with the predictions of Chaos et al. [347] and JetSurf [339]
mechanisms. However, the predicted and measured values of Small-
bone et al. [346] are significantly lower than other values for 2 atm

shown by decades since the work of Davis and Law [445]. Various
color codes group the data by decades since then. Significant scatter
can be observed in the measured data over last two decades with
various techniques as seen in Fig. 86. A comparison with LLNL mech

a maximum value of (cid:1) 33.5 cm/s for f = 1.1.

lower values compared to various mechanism predictions at all mix-
ture equivalence ratios. The measurements of Zhou et al. [453] using
spherical flames and non-linear model for stretch extrapolation
show significantly lower values of LBV for the complete range of
mixture equivalence ratios. A close comparison of the data reported
by Smallbone et al. [346], Huang et al. [447], Kumar et al. [448] com-
pares well with the flat flame data obtained using the heat flux

et al. [448], van Lipzig et al. [449], and Sileghem et al. [148] show a
parabolic variation of the temperature exponent. Similar behavior
has been observed for other alkane fuels as well and also predicted
with various detailed kinetic mechanisms. However, it is to be noted
that LLNL mech 3.0 [344] significantly over predicts the values of a
as compared to other mechanisms. The predictions of Hasse et al.
[349] and LLNL mech 3.0 [344] mechanisms are in reasonably good
agreement with the measurements of Sileghem et al. [148] and Lip-
zig et al. [449] obtained using the heat-flux method. It is to be noted
here that Kumar et al. [448] (stagnation flame method with linear

propagation method with linear extrapolation model) show non-
linear and linear variation of temperature exponent, a respectively
with mixture equivalence ratio.The values of temperature exponent,

from a limited set of LBV data upto a mixture temperature of 398 K.

that the predictions of Hasse et al. [349]) and LLNL mech 3.0 [344]
are in close agreement with the experimental data at 360 K. The data
of Dirrenberger et al. [149] reports lower values for rich mixtures at
360 K. A significant disagreement between the experimentally mea-
sured data and mechanism predictions can be seen at 470 K mixture
temperature. The reported values of Kumar et al. [448] with stagna-
tion flame method agree well with the predictions of various mecha-
nisms. However, these values are significantly higher than the
extrapolated values (using Eq. (8)) of Sileghem et al. [148], van Lipzig
et al. [449] and Dirrenberger et al. [149] using heat-flux method. A
similar comparison of LBV at 400 K mixture temperature is shown in
Fig. 89(b). The predictions of LLNL mech 3.0 [344] and Hasse et al.
[349] are in good agreement with the measurements of Sileghem
et al. [148], Dirrenberger et al. [149], and others obtained with the
heat-flux method for lean mixtures. However, there is a small dis-
agreement for rich mixtures. This disagreement between the experi-
mentally measured values and mechanism predictions is expected
to become worse at higher mixture temperatures of 500(cid:1)700 K due
to a difference between the predicted and measured values of the
temperature exponent, a. Experimental measurements of Kumar
et al. [448] using stagnation flame method with linear extrapolation
model for stretch correction are higher than the extrapolated data
reported using the heat-flux method [148,149,449]. This could be
due to the issues related to linear/non-linear stretch extrapolation
for stretched flames with stagnation flame method. This calls for
more scrutiny of the measurements as well as mechanisms at higher
mixture temperatures. There is a need to obtain accurate experi-
mental data at higher mixture temperatures and readdress the issue
of detailed mechanisms with respect to these measurements.

4.9.2.3. Pressure dependence of isooctane + air flames. The variation of
the pressure exponent, b with mixture equivalence ratio is reported
in Fig. 90. Only Marshall et al. [456] have reported the variation of
the pressure exponent, b from spherical flames using pressure-time
approach and it is compared with the predictions of the LLNL mech
3.0 [344]. Although LLNL mech 3.0 [344] predicts a variation of pres-
sure exponent, b similar to gaseous alkane fuels, the trend is not
observed in the experimental measurements by Marshall et al.
[456]. The possible reasons could be the issues related to the

formation of instabilities in spherically propagating flames under
high-pressure conditions due to higher Lewis number of isooc-
tane + air mixtures. Additionally, lack of extrapolation of LBV to zero
stretch values could be another reason for this mismatch between
the experimental measurements and mechanism predictions.

Fig. 91 shows the comparison of the LBV for isooctane + air mix-
tures at higher pressures and elevated mixture temperatures. Due to
non-availability of extensive experimental data at particular pres-
sure and temperature conditions for isooctane + air mixtures, very
limited data are available for comparison. The details of the condi-
tions are summarized in the figure. The values reported by Farrell
et al. [425] using pressure-time trace are significantly higher com-
pared to other data in the figure. These values obtained from pres-
sure-time history ignore the flame stretch correction, resulting in
significantly higher values of the LBV. Similarly, Marshall et al. [456]
also ignore the flame stretch corrections to obtain the laminar burn-
ing velocities. Overall, the data of Farrell et al. [425] and Marshall
et al. [456] match relatively better with LLNL mech 3.0 [344] predic-
tions, particularly for lean mixture range. Similarly, the detailed

mechanism simulations are able to predict the trend of Jerzembeck
et al. [147] at a higher pressure of 10 atm.

Fig. 92 shows the comparison of laminar burning velocities at 10
atm and 25 atm pressure conditions. The measured burning veloci-
ties compare well with the predictions of LLNL mechanism [344] at
25 atm pressure. However, the significant disagreement can be
observed for the measurements of Bradley et al. [209] at 10 atm
pressure. It is to be noted here that the data considered for compari-
son is obtained using spherical flame method with linear extrapola-
tion model [147,209].

To briefly summarize, for isooctane + air mixtures, experimental
data compares well with certain mechanisms [344,349] up to 360 K
mixture temperatures. However, following issues need to be read-
dressed for isooctane + air mixtures to gain better understanding
about the variation of the LBV.

(i) To understand the variation of the temperature exponent, a
with equivalence ratios, additional experimental data are
required. Currently very limited data with the heat-flux method,
stagnation flame and spherical flame propagation method exist.
The comparison between the measured temperature exponent,
a and predicted values is relatively poor resulting in significant
differences between the predicted and measured laminar burn-
ing velocities at elevated mixture temperatures.

(ii) Significant disagreement

in the data of

laminar burning
velocities exists between various methods such as heat-flux,
stagnation flame and spherical flame method for mixture
temperatures greater than 400 K. The issue need to be revis-
ited from the perspective of accurate prediction of tempera-
ture effects on the LBV and subsequent validation of kinetic
mechanisms.

(iii) Insufficient data available at higher pressures to check the valid-
ity of the existing mechanisms at high pressures and compare
the pressure exponent variation, b.

4.9.3. Laminar burning velocity of n-decane + air mixtures

4.9.3.1. Mixture dependence of n-decane + air flames. n-decane is a
component of gasoline and kerosene, which has been extensively
studied over the years with an aim to develop reliable kinetic models
for higher hydrocarbons and thereby enabling better understanding
the combustion mechanisms of fossil fuels. Toward this, a compari-
son of LBV of n-decane + air mixtures at 400 K is considered here and
presented in Fig. 93. Various researchers have used either spherical
flame propagation method or stagnation flame method to measure
the LBV at different temperatures. Most of the data reported in this
figure shows a maximum burning velocity of 60 § 2 cm/s observed
for slightly rich mixtures at f = 1.1. However, Kumar et al. [457]
report a burning velocity of 68 cm/s at f = 1.1 and Hui et al. [151]
report a burning velocity of 65.5 cm/s for the same mixture
conditions.

Fig. 94 presents the available stretch-corrected data obtained
with spherical flame method and stagnation flame method at 400 K
together with modeling results. Spherical flame method without
stretch correction was used by Ali et al. [228] and Kim et al. [460], as
they utilized the pressure-time recording for obtaining the LBV, and
their measurements are not shown in Fig. 84. Following color code is

method with linear extrapolation was used by Singh et al. [459] and
Comandini et al. [462] recently. Kumar et al. [457] and Hui et al.
[151] reported very high values of the LBV using stagnation flame
method with linear stretch extrapolation. When non-linear extrapo-
lation is used with the same stagnation flame method [180,461] the
burning velocity values obtained were about 3 cm/s lower than the
linear extrapolation method [151,457]. A comparison with various

detailed mechanisms shows that only JetsurF 2.0 [339] mechanism
is able to give a closer match with the experimental measurements.
The predictions from all other kinetic mechanisms [350,458] over
predict the variation of the LBV with equivalence ratio.

4.9.3.2. Temperature dependence of n-decane + air flames. To gain bet-
ter insight, a variation of the temperature exponent, a is plotted
with mixture equivalence ratio as shown in Fig. 85. Very limited
data of the temperature exponent could be extracted from the exist-
ing literature of Kumar et al. [457] and Ali et al. [228]. It is interesting
to note that Ali et al. [228] used pressure-time recording for obtain-
ing the laminar burning velocities and they show a nearly constant
value of a (cid:3) 2.0 for 0.7 (cid:1) f (cid:1) 1.1. These values are much higher
when compared with the predictions of various detailed kinetic
mechanisms [339,350,458] as shown in Fig. 95. A similar comparison
of the experimental data of Kumar et al. [457] with mechanism pre-
dictions shows that although the magnitude of a is closer to mecha-
nism predictions, none of the mechanisms accurately predict the
experimentally observed behavior. It is to be noted that the mecha-
nisms of Zhao mech 2 [350], JetsurF 2.0 [339] and Poli Mi mech 2
[458] predict a similar variation of temperature exponent over a
large range of mixture equivalence ratios.

A detailed comparison of laminar burning velocities of n-dec-
ane + air mixtures was carried out at various mixture temperatures
of 338 K and 470 K as shown in Fig. 96(a). At a mixture temperature
of 338 K, the data of Kumar et al. [457] and Alekseev et al. [463]
matches well with each other, as well as with the predictions of Poli
Mi mech 2 [458]. The predicted laminar burning velocities of Jet surf
2.0 [339] are slightly lower than the measured burning velocities at
338 K mixture temperature. Additional comparison at a mixture
temperature of 470 K shows that the predictions of Poli Mi mech 2
[458] are in closer agreement with the measurements of Kumar
et al. [457]. Other measurements reported by Skjoth-Rasmussen
et al. [464] and Ali et al. [228] are significantly different from the
mechanism predictions as clear from Fig. 96(a). A similar compari-
son of the experimental data (Fig. 96(b)) at 360 K also shows a closer
agreement between the measurements of Alekseev et al. [463] using
heat-flux method, Kumar et al. [457] using counter flow burner and
mechanism predictions of Poli Mi mech 2 [458].

tion of these combustion mechanisms at higher pressures.

4.10. Laminar burning velocity of alcohol + air mixtures

Various alcohol fuels, particularly first four aliphatic compounds
(methanol, ethanol, propanol and butanol) are of significant interest
to combustion research community as future renewable fuels
because these alcohols can be synthesized chemically or biologically.
Their thermochemical properties allow them to be used in various IC
engines and other combustion systems. Alcohols can be easily
blended with gasoline and used in automotive engines efficiently
because of their higher octane number rating and clean combustion
characteristics [465(cid:1)467]. Due to these advantages, researchers
have extensively studied the combustion characteristics of various
alcohol + air mixtures [467(cid:1)471]. A critical analysis of the efforts in
understanding the variation of LBV with different parameters is pre-
sented in this section.

4.10.1. Laminar burning velocity of methanol + air mixtures

4.10.1.1. Mixture dependence of methanol + air flames. The variation
of the LBV for methanol + air mixtures is shown in Fig. 97. Only post-
stretch era measurements are shown in the figure by decades since
the measurements of Egolfopuolos et al. [473], and Davis and Law
[173]. A significant scatter can be observed in the data reported dur-
ing last three decades. A comparison of the data with the predictions
of the detailed kinetic mechanisms of Li mech 1 [351] and San Diego
Mech [472] is also shown in the figure. Saeed and Stone [474] have
reported the highest burning velocity measured using the pressure-
time data of spherically propagating flames to extract the LBV. How-
ever, the data are not corrected for the flame stretch resulting in
higher magnitude of laminar burning velocities [474]. To show a bet-
ter comparison between the mechanism predictions and recent
measurements, the data of Saeed and Stone [474] is neglected
(obtained using pressure-time records). Only recent data from the
group of de Goey and coworkers is considered and shown in Fig. 98
for better comparison [478] as the data reported using heat-flux

To briefly summarize, for n-decane + air mixtures, experimental
data compares well with certain mechanisms up to 360 K mixture
temperatures. However, following issues need to be readdressed for
n-decane + air mixtures to gain a better understanding.

(i) The comparison between the limited data of temperature expo-
nent, a and predicted values is poor resulting in significant dif-
ferences between the predicted and measured laminar burning
velocities at elevated mixture temperatures greater than 360 K.
To obtain better understanding of the variation of the tempera-
ture exponent, a with equivalence ratios, additional experimen-
tal data are required.

(ii) High-pressure data are not available for n-decane fuel. There is a
need to invest more efforts to establish the dependence of lami-
nar burning velocity of n-decane + air mixtures at higher pres-
sures. Accurate measurement of laminar burning velocities will
also help in establishing a relation between the mixture pres-
sure and laminar burning velocity variation. This will help in

method are independent of stretch correction and quite close the
each other [476(cid:1)478].

The color codes used in this figure and following figures denote
the measurement method and stretch-correction approach imple-
mented: green (cid:1) Spherical flame method with linear extrapolation
model suggested by Markstein [73]; red (cid:1) stagnation flame method
with linear extrapolation model originated from Wu and Law [34];
black (cid:1) heat flux method and externally preheated diverging chan-
nel method. It is interesting to note from Figs. 97 and 98 that the
data reported by Vancoillie et al. [476], Bardin et al. [477], and Sile-
ghem et al. [478] using heat-flux method is in close agreement with
the experimental measurements of Katoch et al. [242] using an
externally heated diverging channel method. The disagreement
between the measurements of Vancoillie et al. [476] and Katoch
et al. [242] and model predictions [351,472] is notable at f = 1.1. All
the experimental measurements show the existence of a maximum
LBV at f = 1.1, whereas both the kinetic models predict a maximum
burning velocity at f = 1.2. Overall, the predictions of San Diego
mech [472] and Li mech 1 [351] compare well with various experi-
mental data [242,476,478] in 0.8 (cid:1) f (cid:1) 1.2 range.

Fig. 99 shows the variation of the temperature exponent, a with
equivalence ratio for methanol + air mixtures and its comparison
with various mechanisms. The magenta colored data of Metghalchi
and Keck [479] and Saeed and Stone [474] is not corrected for flame
stretch and shows unusual variation with mixture equivalence ratio.
The measured data of Liao et al. [475] using spherical flames cor-
rected to stretch with linear model compares well with the mecha-
nism predictions [351,472]. It is to be noted here that the measured
values using the heat flux method [476,478] and diverging channel
method [242] are lower than the predicted values of temperature
exponent, a in 0.9 (cid:1) f (cid:1) 1.3 range. However, the measured data
points using the heat flux method [476,478] and diverging channel
method [242] are relatively close to each other irrespective of the
measurement technique used. Overall, various mechanisms are able
to predict the trend of variation of a with equivalence ratio; how-
ever, quantitative disagreement between the experimental data
[242,475,476,478] and kinetic model predictions [351,472] remains
to be investigated further. It is to be noted further that the kinetic

models predict a minimum value of temperature exponent, a for
f = 1.2 as compared to experimental data showing a minimum value
at f = 1.1. Larger uncertainties in the values of temperature expo-
nent, a, are observed in the reported data as shown in the figure.
Determination of temperature exponent, a, from a limited tempera-
ture range data of laminar burning velocities results in increased
uncertainties. This indicates that a readdressing of this issue at
higher mixture temperatures and improved data sets will be
required to accurately predict the variation of LBV at higher mixture
temperatures using Eq. (8) along with the values of laminar burning
velocities at 300 K mixture temperature and temperature exponent,
a values.

Fig. 100 shows the comparison of the LBV at various mixture
temperatures and 1 atm pressure. It is interesting to note from
Fig. 100 that for a mixture temperature of 343 K and 500 K, the mea-
sured [175,473] and indirectly obtained (Vancoillie et al. [476], Sile-
ghem et al. [478] and Katoch et al. [242]) laminar burning velocities
match well with the mechanism predictions 1 [351,472] .The data of
Katoch et al. [242] matches well up to a mixture equivalence ratio of
f = 1.2. Fig. 101 shows the comparison of LBV at 400 K and 600 K
mixture temperatures. For higher mixture temperatures of 500 K
and 600 K, the predictions of both the detailed kinetic model match
well for leaner mixtures. However, these predictions are much
higher than measured burning velocities obtained indirectly using
Eq. (8) for stoichiometric and rich mixtures. This is due to lower val-
ues of temperature exponent, a reported in the measurements by
various researchers [242,476,478]. It is to be noted that the data of
Sileghem et al. [478], Vancoillie et al. [476] is obtained through the
extrapolation of the existing low-temperature data (<400 K) using
temperature exponent, a. The disagreement for stoichiometric and
rich mixtures at higher temperatures calls for more focused studies
on understanding the methanol oxidation at those conditions using
both experimental studies and detailed kinetic studies.

the variation of the pressure exponent, b and its comparison with

posed a linear decrease in the pressure exponent, b, with mixture
equivalence ratio based on their extensive studies. However, it is to
be noted here that the data of both research groups [479] and [474]
are not corrected to stretch. Detailed kinetic studies using Li et al.
[351] and San Diego mechanism [472] also predicted an unusual
behavior of the variation of pressure exponent, b as shown in
Fig. 102 following the trend of the experimental results. However, a
detailed comparison between the results showed a significant dis-
agreement between the measured and predicted values of the lami-
nar burning velocities at higher pressures.

To briefly summarize, for methanol + air mixtures, experimental
data compares well with the mechanisms of Li et al. [351] and San
Diego mech [472] up to 400 K mixture temperature. Following issues
needs to be readdressed.

i. Both kinetic models predict a maximum burning velocity and a
minimum temperature exponent, alpha values at f = 1.2. There-
fore, both the kinetic models fail to predict the existence of max-
imum burning velocity and minimum temperature exponent
values at f = 1.1.

ii. Comparison of the measured values of the temperature expo-
nent, a, with the model predictions of various kinetic models is
rather poor. This results in a significant difference in the mea-
sured and predicted values of laminar burning velocities at
higher mixture temperatures.

iii. Significant disagreement exists between the data reported using
different methods such as heat-flux, stagnation flame burner,
and spherical flame method. The issue needs to be revisited.
iv. Insufficient data available at high pressures to check the validity
of the existing mechanisms at high pressures. The trend of pres-
sure exponent, b predicted by Li et al. [351] and San Diego mech
[472] are significantly different as compared to other alcohols
and hydrocarbons and need further investigations.

4.10.2. Laminar burning velocity of ethanol + air mixtures

4.10.2.1. Mixture dependence of ethanol + air flames. Ethanol
is a
renewable fuel and could be added to gasoline to oxygenate the fuel
and reduce the combustion emissions significantly [468]. The addi-
tion of ethanol to gasoline bears significance as it has higher octane
number, thereby helping improve the anti-knocking properties of
the fuels. Therefore, it is important to understand the effect of vari-
ous parameters on the combustion characteristics of ethanol + air
mixtures and summarize the current advances in the field.

The variation of the LBV for ethanol + air mixtures with equiva-

for stoichiometric and rich mixtures. The reported experimental
data [227,247,473,478,480,481,] for lean mixtures are significantly
lower (20 (cid:1) 50%) than mechanism predictions [329,335,352,353].
The predictions using San Diego mechanism [472] and Aramco mech
1.3 [352] match well for near stoichiometric and slightly rich mix-
tures. The recent data of van Lipzig et al. [449] and Dirrenberger
et al. [149] are reasonably close to the predictions of Marinov mech-
anism [353]. To present a better comparison of the experimental
data with mechanism prediction, the recent data with different mea-
surement techniques are shown in Fig. 104. The color codes used in
this figure and following figures denote the measurement method

tein [73]; red (cid:1) stagnation flame method with linear extrapolation
model originated from Wu and Law [34]; blue (cid:1) spherical flame

flux method and diverging channel method. It can be noted that the
measurements of Sileghem et al. [478], Dirrenberger et al. [149] and
Katoch et al. [482] show a good quantitative agreement with mecha-
nism predictions for lean mixtures. The measurements of Egolfopuo-
los et al. [473], Liao et al. [480] and Bradley et al. [481] report
significantly lower values (»20 (cid:1) 30%) of the LBV for lean mixtures.
The issue of prediction of LBV for very rich mixtures needs to be seri-
ously addressed because a significant disagreement can be observed
between the various mechanism predictions and their comparison
with existing experimental data for f > 1.2.

4.10.2.2. Temperature dependence of ethanol+air flames. Fig. 105
shows the variation of the temperature exponent with equivalence
ratio for ethanol+air mixtures. All mechanisms (Aramco mech 2
[352], San Diego Mech [472], Konnov mech [247], Marinov et al.
[353]) predict a parabolic variation of the temperature exponent, a
with equivalence ratio, consistent with various other fuels. However,
it is to be noted that a significant difference exists between the pre-
dictions of various mechanisms. The mechanism of Konnov et al.
[247] predicts lower values of temperature exponents, a and San
Diego mechanism [472] predicts higher values over a complete
range of mixture equivalence ratios. A similar variation of the
temperature exponent, a has been reported in the experimental
measurements by various researchers [149,227,247,478,480,481,
482,483]. It is to be noted that Liao et al. [480] Bradley et al. [481]
and Eisazadeh-Far et al. [227] reported a linear decrease in tempera-
ture exponent with equivalence ratio. Similar disagreement between
mechanism predictions and measurements of Dirrenberger et al.
[149] is perhaps due to extraction of temperature exponent from
limited data reported by the authors. The trend of the measured
temperature exponent, a values of Konnov et al. [247], Sileghem
et al. [478] and Katoch et al. [482] matches well with the mecha-
nism predictions. It is to be noted here that a significant disagree-
ment can be observed between various experimental data as well

the mechanism predictions except for the measurements reported
from heat flux method [247,478] and externally heated divering
channel method [482]. The disagreement indicates that readdress-
ing of the issue is needed at higher mixture temperatures to help
accurately measure and predict the LBV variation.

To show a detailed comparison at higher mixture temperatures,
laminar burning velocities for ethanol + air mixtures at 358(cid:1)363 K
mixture temperatures are plotted and compared with various mech-
anism predictions as shown in Fig. 106. For mixtures with f (cid:1) 0.9,
the predicted values of LBV are relatively much higher than the
experimentally measured values. The predictions of Aramco mech 2
[352] and San Diego mech [472] are consistently higher than the
measured values using different methods [149,247,478,483,484] for
complete range of equivalence ratio. A close match between the
measured and predicted values of Marinov mech [353] can be seen
for nearly stoichiometric conditions. For rich mixtures, the Marinov
mech [353] under predicts the values of laminar burning velocities.

A detailed comparison of laminar burning velocities at 453 K mix-
ture temperature is shown in Fig. 106. The data of Katoch et al. [482]
Agsaee et al. [483] compare well with the predictions of Aramco
mech 2 [352] and San Diego mechanism [472] predictions. The
measurements of Egolfopuolos et al. [473] also show a good compar-
ison with the mechanism predictions at 453 K. However, most of the
data reported with the heat flux method [149,247,478] are signifi-
cantly lower than mechanism predictions (Aramco mech 2 [352],
San Diego Mech [472], Marinov mechanism [353]) for lean mixtures.
The predictions of Marinov mechanism [353] seem to match well
with the heat flux measurements [149,247,478] for nearly stoichio-
metric and slightly rich mixtures. It is important to note here that
the data from the heat flux method reported in this figure (453 K) is
obtained through extrapolation of low temperature data to higher
mixture temperatures using Eq. (8) with So
L and temperature expo-
nent, a values. The extrapolated data of Konnov et al. [247], Sile-
ghem et al. [478] and Dirrenberger et al. [149] matches well with
each other as well as with the predictions of Marinov et al. [353] for
1.0 (cid:1) f (cid:1) 1.2 range. The measurements of Katoch et al. [482] are
closer to the predictions of San Diego mech [472] and Aramco mech
2 [352] for stoichiometric and leaner mixtures. For other equivalence

ratios, measured experimental data are significantly lower than the
predictions of various mechanisms.

4.10.2.3. Pressure dependence of ethanol+air flames. Fig. 107 shows
the variation of the pressure exponent, b with mixture equivalence
ratio for ethanol + air mixtures. Various mechanisms [Aramco mech
2 [352], San Diego mech [472], Marinov mech [353]] predict a varia-
tion of pressure exponent, b similar to that of various alkane fuels
with a maximum value for nearly stoichiometric mixtures. The
measurements of Eisazadeh et al. [227] have predicted the linear
variation of the pressure exponent, b. The data of Bradley et al. [481]
and Varea et al. [485] show a behavior, qualitatively similar to the
mechanism predictions (Aramco mech 2 [352], San Diego mech
[472], Marinov mech [353]). However, a significant disagreement
can be seen for rich mixtures as clear from the figure. The limited
availability of accurate data calls for a focused work on bringing out
a detailed quantitative comparison between the models and experi-
mental data.

Due to lack of experimental data at specific pressure and temper-
ature conditions, it becomes difficult to choose experimental data to
compare with different mechanisms, particularly for liquid fuels due
to varying thermophysical properties of these fuels such as boiling
point and vapor pressure of the fuel at atmospheric pressure condi-
tions. An effort is made to present a comparison of the existing data
with different mechanisms to show their prediction capabilities for
the given range of conditions. Fig. 108 shows the variation of the
LBV of ethanol + air mixtures at 10 atm pressure conditions.

The recent measurements [227,481,486] using spherical flame
propagation method show significant variation in the measured
data, particularly for the leaner mixtures. The reported values are
very low as compared to other measurements as well as mechanism
predictions. The measurements reported by Beeckmann et al. [486]
and Varea et al. [485] are slightly higher than the mechanism predic-
tions. Mechanism predictions lie between two experimental meas-
urements for the lean mixture as shown in the figure. For rich
mixtures, the mechanism predictions tend to yield lower values
than experimental measurements. However, it is to be noted that
the difference between various measurements varies within
20(cid:1)40%.

and spherical flame method. The issue needs to be revisited
with more accurate experimental data and precise modeling.
(iii) Insufficient data available at high pressures to check the validity
of the existing mechanisms at high pressures. The discrepancies
are more pronounced at conditions where temperature and
pressure increase simultaneously.

(iv) Accurate experiments are needed under specified conditions of
pressure and temperature conditions to accurately model the
effect of both parameters on the LBV of ethanol + air mixtures.

4.10.3. Laminar burning velocity of n-propanol+air mixtures

4.10.3.1. Mixture dependence of n-propanol+air flames. Fig. 109
shows the mixture dependence of the LBV for n-propanol + air mix-
tures along with predictions of various mechanisms [155,354,355]
at 343 K mixture temperature and atmospheric pressure. The data of
Veloo and Egolfopuolos [416] is obtained at 343 K mixture tempera-
ture using stagnation flame method and non-linear stretch extrapo-
lation of Wang et al. [489]. The measurements of Capriolo et al. [487]
using heat-flux method at 343 K and Katoch et al. [488] using an
externally heated divering channel are also shown in the figure for
comparison purpose. Both the measurements match well at f = 1.1,
however, the measurements of Capriolo et al. [487] are slightly
higher than those of Veloo and Egolfopuolos [416]. A comparison
with predictions of Galmiche mechanism [355] shows that it signifi-
cantly underestimates the LBV of lean mixtures at 343 K conditions.
However, a good comparison for very rich mixtures can be seen in
the figure. PoliMi mech 3 [155] and Aramco mech 3 [354] show a
reasonably good comparison for lean and stoichiometric mixtures at
given conditions.

Another data set of experimental measurements is reported at
423 K by Gong et al. [418] and Galmiche et al. [355] using spherical
flame method with non-linear stretch extrapolation shown in
Fig. 110. Both the measurements using spherical flame method with
non-linear extrapolation match well with each other except for
0.9 (cid:1) f (cid:1) 1.2 range. A comparison with predictions of different
kinetic models shows that the predictions of Galmiche et al.

To briefly summarize, for ethanol + air mixtures, various mecha-
nisms (Aramco mech 2 [352], San Diego mech [472], Marinov mech
[353]) significantly over predict the values of LBV for leaner mixtures
and under predict for richer mixtures at various conditions. Follow-
ing issues needs to be readdressed.

(i) The measured values of the temperature exponent, a, are signif-
icantly lower than the predicted values except for Agasaee et al.
[483]. This results in a significant difference in the measured
and predicted values of the laminar burning velocities at higher
mixture temperatures.

(ii) Significant disagreement exists between the data reported using
different methods such as heat-flux, stagnation flame method,

mechanism [355] compare very well for complete range of equiva-
lence ratio. However, the measurements of Katoch et al. [488] at
423 K mixture temperature are in good agreement with the predic-
tions of both PoliMi mech 3 [155] and Aramco mech 3 [354]. It is
interesting to note that the difference between the predictions from
the kinetic models of Johnson et al. [354] and Ranzi et al. (2011)
significantly overestimate the laminar burning velocities at 423 K
mixture temperatures.

4.10.3.2. Pressure dependence of n-propanol + air flames. A compari-
son of burning velocities for n-propanol + air mixtures at 3 atm and
10 atm pressures is shown in Fig. 111 with the predictions of differ-
ent kinetic models. The experimental data obtained using spherical
flame method and non-linear extrapolation method [355,486] is
compared with the prediction of the kinetic models [155,354,355]. It
is to be noted that the predictions of Galmiche et al. mechanism
[355] match well with their measurements at 3 atm pressure. The
predictions of PoliMi mechanism [155] are significantly lower than
the measurements of Galmiche et al. [355] at 3 atm pressure condi-
tions. A similar comparison at 10 atm pressure shows that the data
of Beeckmann et al. [486] using same technique compares well with
the predictions of PoliMi mechanism [155]. However, Johnson et al.
mechanism [354] significantly underestimates the burning velocities
at 10 atm pressure.

There is no data available at other temperatures and pressures to
enable the extraction of temperature exponent, a and pressure
exponent, b for further comparison. Therefore, there is a strong need
to carry out more experiments at various temperatures and pressure
to obtain better models for the combustion of n-propanol fuel.

4.10.4. Laminar burning velocity of n-butanol + air mixtures

n-butanol is generally derived from various renewable sources
such as biomass, algae and other agricultural feedstocks using
microbial fermentation and chemical synthesis. It is proposed to be
used as a renewable fuel with characteristics being similar to other
alcohol and fossil fuels. Therefore, it is being actively considered as a
good alternative to conventional gasoline and diesel fuels. To under-
stand the combustion characteristics of n-butanol, a detailed analy-
sis of the existing results of laminar burning velocities is presented
below.

Tu = 343 K and 423 K. Lines: calculations using models of Sarathy mech 2009 [356], Liu

(Heat-flux method) -Knorsch et al. 2014 [455]. (For interpretation of the references to

4.10.4.1. Mixture dependence of n-butanol + air flames. Fig. 112 shows
dependence of the LBV for n-butanol + air mixtures along with pre-
dictions of various kinetic mechanisms [356(cid:1)358] at 353 K and
423 K mixture temperatures and atmospheric pressure. It is to be
noted here that Sarathy et al. [356], Gu et al. [490] and Liu et al.
[451] have used spherical flame propagation method with linear
extrapolation model for stretch correction. Veloo et al. [175] have
used stagnation flame method with non-linear extrapolation model
of Wang et al. [174] and Knorsch et al. [455] have used heat-flux
method to measure laminar burning velocities. These conditions are
chosen for detailed comparison and analysis as many researchers
have reported data of LBV at
these conditions [175,356,451,
455,490]. The detailed kinetic mechanism predictions of Feng et al.
[358] match well with the experimental data of Knorsch et al. [455]
and Veloo et al. [175]. The predictions of Liu et al. [357] mechanism
are slightly lower than Feng et al. [358] for leaner mixtures. Experi-
mental data of Sarathy et al. [356] at 353 K and 0.9 bar pressure
matches well with other experimental data for rich mixtures. How-
ever, there is a significant difference for lean mixtures. A similar
comparison of the experimental data at 423 K shows that none of
the mechanisms are able to accurately predict the variation of LBV at
those conditions. The predictions of Liu et al. [357] are closer to the
experimental measurements of Knorsch et al. [455] except for
0.9 (cid:1) f (cid:1) 1.3 at 423 K. The experimental data of Knorsch et al. [455]
matches relatively better for leaner mixtures (f (cid:1) 0.9). The measure-
ments reported by Gu et al. [490] at 423 K do not match with any of
the mechanism predictions.

A comparison of LBV data of Knorsch et al. [455] at a mixture
temperature of 373 K is shown in Fig. 113. The measurements are in
good agreement over a large range of mixture equivalence ratio with
the predictions of Liu et al. [357] and Feng et al. [358] mechanisms.
The kinetic model of Sarathy et al. [356] underpredicts the LBV at all
equivalence ratios.

4.10.4.2. Temperature dependence of n-butanol + air flames. There
are very limited studies reported in the literature at higher mixture
temperature to assess and derive the variation of temperature
exponent, a for n-butanol + air mixtures. However, the mechanism

development has been actively pursued by various research groups
since past one decade. Fig. 114 shows the variation of the tempera-
ture exponent, a with equivalence ratio using different kinetic
mechanisms [356(cid:1)358]. All the mechanisms show a parabolic varia-
tion of the temperature exponent, a with equivalence ratio. It is to
be noted that all three mechanisms show a close resemblance for
very lean and very rich mixtures. However, a significant difference
can be observed for 0.8 (cid:1) f (cid:1) 1.2 range. Due to this difference, the
predictions of various mechanisms may show significant variation in
the predicted laminar burning velocities shown in Figs. 112 and 113.

4.10.4.3. Pressure dependence of n-butanol + air flames. Fig. 102
shows the comparison of the laminar burning velocities at a higher
pressure of 2.5 atm with mixture temperatures of 413 K and 473 K.
The experimental data of Gu et al. [491] at both temperatures does
not compare well with the predictions using different kinetic mech-
anisms as shown in the figure. Experimental results show that the
peak of LBV is observed for f = 1.3 at 2.5 atm pressure conditions.

tion of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web
version of this article.)

However, all the mechanisms predict a maximum burning velocity
at f = 1.1. A similar comparison of LBV at 10 atm pressure and 373 K
mixture temperature shows that the experimental measurements of
Beeckmann et al. [486] are significantly under-predicted by various
mechanisms [356(cid:1)358].

To briefly summarize, for n-butanol + air mixtures, the predic-
tions from various mechanisms [356(cid:1)358] are significantly different
than the measurements reported in the literature. Following issues
needs to be readdressed for n-butanol + air mixtures..

(i) Measurements of LBV with different techniques show signifi-
cantly different results. More work needed with focused plan of
conducting experiments at standard temperatures to bring out a
better comparison of various techniques, thereby enabling the
development of better kinetic models.

(ii) The experimental data for temperature exponent, a, has not
been reported in the literature. More work needed in this direc-
tion to help obtain better estimates of the laminar burning
velocities at higher mixture temperatures.

(iii) Accurate experiments are needed under specified conditions of
pressure and temperature conditions to accurately model the
effect of both parameters on LBV of n-butanol + air mixtures.
These experiments will help in obtaining accurate variation of
temperature and pressure exponents and thereby better devel-
opment of kinetic models.

4.10.5. Laminar burning velocity of n-pentanol + air mixtures

n-pentanol is one of the second generation biofuels with its prop-
erties comparable to diesel fuel in terms of combustion performance,
gaseous and particulate emissions from various combustion systems
and IC engines [492(cid:1)497]. A study of Heufer et al. [498] suggests
that reactivity of longer carbon chain alcohol fuels is equivalent to
their corresponding alkanes. Compared to low carbon alcohols, n-
pentanol has higher energy density, higher boiling point, lesser
hygroscopicity and corrosiveness [499]. Therefore, n-pentanol
appears to be a good alternative to conventional diesel fuels with
blending [492,497]. To understand the various advances in the com-
bustion characteristics of n-pentanol, a detailed analysis of the exist-
ing results of laminar burning velocities is presented below.

tion of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web

4.10.5.1. Mixture dependence of n-pentanol + air flames. Fig. 116
shows the mixture dependence of the LBV for n-pentanol + air mix-
tures along with predictions of various mechanisms [357,359(cid:1)361]
at 433 K mixture temperature and atmospheric pressure. The data of
Togbe et al. [361] are obtained at 423 K mixture temperature. It is to
be noted here that the experimental data are obtained using spheri-
cal flame propagation method with linear and non-linear extrapola-
tion models for stretch correction. These conditions are chosen for
detailed comparison and analysis as many researchers have reported
data of LBV at these conditions [359,361,499]. The mechanism pre-
dictions of Liu et al. [357] and Wang et al. [360] mechanism match
relatively better with the experimental data of Nativel et al. [499].
The predictions of other mechanisms are significantly lower than
the experimentally measured data as well. The experimental meas-
urements of Li et al. [359] are significantly lower than those of Nati-
vel et al. [499] despite using the spherical flame method with non-
linear method for stretch extrapolation.

Further comparison of LBV data at mixture temperatures of 393 K
and 473 K is shown in Fig. 117. The measurements of Li et al. [359]
appear to be in good agreement with the mechanism predictions of
Liu et al. [357] and Wang et al. [360] for stoichiometric and lean mix-
tures. Predictions of Li et al. [359] and Togbe et al. [361] mechanisms
significantly underestimate the laminar burning velocities. A similar
comparison at 473 K shows that the measured burning velocities are
slightly higher than the predictions of Li et al. [359] and Togbe et al.
[361] mechanisms. The measured burning velocities of Li et al. [359]
are significantly lower than those of Nativel et al. [499] for f > 0.9.

4.10.5.2. Variation of temperature exponent with equivalence ratio.
There are very limited studies in literature at higher mixture tem-
peratures to assess and derive the variation of
temperature
exponent, a for n-pentanol + air mixtures. The mechanism develop-
ment has been actively pursued by various research groups along
with experimental studies. Fig. 118 shows the variation of the tem-
perature exponent, a with equivalence ratio for different mecha-
nisms [357,359(cid:1)361]. All
the mechanisms show a parabolic
variation of the temperature exponent, a with equivalence ratio.
The values of temperature exponent obtained from the analysis of
the experimental data of Nativel et al. [499] are also shown in the

figure for comparison purpose. It is to be noted that all mechanisms
show close resemblance for lean and stoichiometric mixtures. A sig-
nificant difference can be observed for mixtures with f (cid:3) 1.2 range.
Due to this difference, the predictions of various mechanisms may
show significant variation in the predicted laminar burning veloci-
ties shown in Figs. 116 and 117.

4.10.5.3. Comparison of pressure exponent with mixture equivalence
ratio. Fig. 119 shows the variation of the pressure exponent, b with
mixture equivalence ratio for n-pentanol + air mixtures. Various
mechanisms [357,359(cid:1)361] predict a variation of pressure expo-
nent, b similar to that of various alkane fuels with a maximum value
for nearly stoichiometric mixtures. The measurements of Li et al.
[359] and Li et al. [500] show a non-linear variation of pressure
exponent, b similar to that of mechanism predictions. A qualitatively

5. Concluding remarks

In this article, a comprehensive review of recent advances in vari-
ous LBV measurement techniques is presented along with their mer-
its and demerits. The existing LBV data for single component fuels
starting with H2, CH4, higher alkanes, DME, liquid alkanes and alco-
hols have been critically reviewed to understand the effect of ther-
modynamics parameters such as mixture equivalence ratio, mixture
temperature and pressure on the variation of LBV. The data obtained
using different techniques are compared with each other as well as
with the predictions of detailed kinetic models of respective fuels.
Based on the detailed comparison, the outlier and inconsistent data
sets have been identified and recommendations have been made for
future work to be carried out to help in the development of better
kinetic models for these fuels. A brief summary of various findings is
reported below.

(i) Hydrogen: The burning velocities of

lean hydrogen flames
derived from counterflow or spherical flame method could be
unreliable due to the application of linear models with simpli-
fied stretch corrections. Non-linear stretch correction models
and non-stretched flames with the heat-flux method appear
more useful for kinetic model validation and optimization. Anal-
ysis of temperature exponent provides additional powerful tool
for assessment of data consistency and helps segregation of pos-
sible outliers and inconsistencies in the data. All kinetic models
predict a steep rise in the values of temperature exponent of
very lean mixture (f < 0.5), also ably supported by experimen-
tal data obtained using flat flames, and contrary to majority of
the observations from counterflow and spherical flame method
using linear stretch extrapolation model. Various kinetic models
closely follow each other in predicting the effect of pressure on
LBV. Future work should be focused in a direction to obtain a
better agreement of laminar burning velocities at higher mix-
ture temperatures and pressures thereby enabling the detailed
comparison of temperature and pressure exponents for better
model development and their optimization.

(ii) Methane: Methane being one of the most researched fuel, the
recent data reported with different methods and various stretch
extrapolations techniques match well with non-stretched
flames as well as the predictions of kinetic models at ambient
conditions. Significant scatter observed in the values of temper-
ature exponent (at stoichiometric conditions) till last decade,
this value has converged to »1.6 during recent years. The non-
instance, heat-flux
stretch correction based methods,
method and diverging channel method have ably reported the
variation of temperature exponent with equivalence ratio. A
good way to test the validity of reported values is through
detailed comparison of laminar burning velocities at higher mix-
ture temperatures. The values obtained from experimental data
and kinetic models predictions are in close agreement for mix-
ture temperatures upto 600 K. For comparing pressure depen-
dence, few experimental data are available and the recent
findings with the heat-flux method compare well both qualita-
tively and quantitatively upto a pressure of 5 atm indicating that
sufficient scope exists for further work at higher pressures and
mixture temperatures.

for

(iii) Higher alkanes (Ethane, propane and n-butane): Detailed com-
parison of LBV data for higher alkanes (ethane, propane and n-
butane) at ambient conditions shows that the recent data of
these fuels matches closely with various kinetic models at ambi-
ent conditions indicating the adequacy of the experiments and
kinetic models. However, a detailed analysis at higher mixture
temperatures and pressures shows the unavailability of any
data for ethane fuel. Therefore, no comparison of LBV at higher
mixture temperatures and pressure could be presented at those

mental data: Li et al. (2013) [359] open symbols (cid:1) Linear extrapolation, closed sym-

good comparison between the mechanism predictions and experi-
mental measurement can be seen in the figure. The availability of
limited and accurate data calls for a focused work on bringing out a
detailed quantitative comparison between the models and experi-
mental data.

4.10.5.4. Comparison of laminar burning velocity at high pressures.
PFig. 120 shows the comparison of the laminar burning velocities at a
higher pressure of 2.5 and 7.5 bar with mixture equivalence ratio at
a temperature of 433 K. The experimental data of Li et al. [359] and
Li et al. [500] at the given mixture temperatures compares reason-
ably well with the predictions of different mechanisms as shown
in the figure. The mechanism predictions of Togbe et al. [361]
mechanism are lowest and far from experimental measurements
[359,500].

conditions. For propane fuel, only data of temperature exponent
available is with diverging channel method and it matches both
qualitatively and quantitatively with kinetic model predictions.
Some researchers have invested efforts and reported the varia-
tion of pressure exponent with equivalence ratio for propane
fuel. The reported data matched qualitatively with the kinetic
model predictions. Similarly for n-butane fuel, limited experi-
mental data on temperature exponent and pressure exponent
variation makes it difficult to present a complete comparison
between experimental data and kinetic model predictions. Over-
all, more work is required at higher pressure and temperature
conditions to understand the accurate variation of temperature
exponent and pressure exponent for these fuels. This will further
help in the development of accurate kinetic models for these
fuels and their further validation.

(iv) DME: A detailed comparison of the recent data of laminar burn-
ing velocities for DME + air mixtures with the predictions of
detailed kinetic models shows that the measured values using
non-linear stretch extrapolation method and diverging channel
method are slightly lower for lean mixtures than the predicted
values. LLNL mechanism and Aramco mechanism significantly
overpredict the laminar burning velocities for stoichiometric and
rich mixtures at ambient conditions. Zhao mechanism and Wang
mechanism are able to accurately predict the variation of laminar
burning velocities for rich mixtures as well. The temperature
exponent variation reported using diverging channel technique
compares well with the predictions of detailed kinetic mecha-
nisms and results in good qualitative and quantitative match
between experimental data along with predictions at higher mix-
ture temperatures as well. The pressure exponent variation
reported using spherical flame method matches qualitatively
with the kinetic model predictions. More focused work needed at
higher pressures to obtain quantitative match with the experi-
mental data for further validation and optimization of the
detailed kinetic models for DME + air mixtures.

(v) Liquid alkanes (n-heptane, isooctane, n-decane): Detailed com-
parison of laminar burning velocities for liquid alkanes(n-hep-
tane, isooctane and n-decane) shows that some of the recent
data of these fuels matches closely with various kinetic models
indicating the adequacy of the experimental data and certain
kinetic models. In case of n-heptane, the data obtained using
stagnation flame method with linear extrapolation model for
stretch correction show significant scatter over the years with
recent data being similar to that of the heat-flux method.
Slightly lower values of temperature exponent than kinetic
model predictions are obtained from limited data sets using the
heat-flux method, resulting in lower burning velocities at higher
mixture temperatures. Laminar burning velocities at higher
pressures show a relatively good qualitative and quantitative
match between experiments and model predictions. For isooc-
tane fuel, the experimental values of temperature exponent
show different trends and the predictions of kinetic models dif-
fer significantly due to unavailability of vast sets of data at
higher mixture temperatures. Similar observation was made
about the variation of pressure exponent and burning velocity
variation at higher pressures for isooctane + air mixtures. Analy-
sis of n-decane + air mixture data shows the non-availability of
sufficient data for obtaining detailed comparison of burning
velocity at higher temperatures and pressures as well as the var-
iation of temperature exponent and pressure exponent for these
fuels. This will help to obtain better and accurate models and
their validation for prediction of burning velocities at conditions
relevant to practical applications.

(vi) Alcohols (Methanol, ethanol, n-butanol, n-propanol, n-petpa-
nol): Detailed comparison of laminar burning velocities for
methanol, ethanol and n-butanol + air mixtures at ambient

conditions shows that the recent data of these fuels matches
closely with various kinetic models at ambient conditions indi-
cating the adequacy of the experimental data and certain kinetic
models. Sufficient experimental data of temperature exponent
for methanol and ethanol are available with different techniques
and a qualitative match can be observed with kinetic models.
However, limited data are available in literature for n-buta-
nol + air mixtures at different temperature and pressure condi-
tions. Therefore, issues related to quantitative comparison of
temperature exponent, pressure exponent and burning veloci-
ties at higher temperature and higher pressures need to be
addressed seriously using different techniques to help validate
the existing kinetic models and their further development.

To summarize, a close agreement between experimental data
and model predictions can be observed for various fuels at ambient
conditions. The measurement data reported at higher mixture tem-
peratures with different techniques show significant differences
with each other as well as model predictions. The differences
between measured data obtained with linear stretch extrapolation
technique and kinetic model predictions are significant for stagna-
tion flame method and spherical flame method. A closer agreement
was observed for experimental data obtained from non-stretch cor-
rection methods such as heat-flux method and diverging channel
method and non-linear stretch extrapolation technique with stag-
nation flame and spherical flame method. Analysis of temperature
exponent shows that a reasonably close agreement exists for some
fuels (H2, CH4, C3H8 and some liquid fuels) and more work required
for other fuels. Similarly the data on the variation of the pressure
exponent is scarce. Focused work is required to obtain better
understanding of LBV at higher pressures. To bring out a better
comparison between the data of different methods, the raw data
should be made accessible for analysis to other research groups
along with detailed implementation of various data reduction tech-
niques employed by respective research groups for detailed scru-
tiny. Analysis of the data consistency of the LBV measurements of
various fuel + air mixtures presented in this work clearly demon-
strated that earlier publications underestimate the experimental
uncertainties. This lack of the critical evaluation of uncertainties is
often manifested as unexplained differences between measure-
ments performed using different methods.

5.1. Recommendations and future perspectives

The current review focuses on the variation of laminar burning
velocity with mixture equivalence ratio, temperature and pressure
for important single component fuels. The detailed review shows
that significant work must be carried out to present a consistent
database on laminar burning velocity values to enable accurate
development and validation of kinetic models. Various recommen-
dations are summarized below.

1. There is a need of unified approach for stretch correction from
raw data for spherical and stagnation flame method. The raw
experimental data must be made available for analysis to other
research groups for comparison and analysis purpose. Accurate
information on initial operating conditions, purity of gases/ oxi-
dizer and their composition, accuracy of instrumentation and
uncertainty calculations should be presented to enable better
comparison among different methods.

2. Very limited data exists for mixture temperatures greater than
500 K. Only diverging channel method reports direct measure-
ment of laminar burning velocity at higher temperatures. A
comparison of measurements with different methods will help
obtain better estimates of temperature exponent, a. This would

259

further enable the development of accurate kinetic models at
higher temperatures.

3. Limited measurements exist at high pressures conditions.
Recent efforts with heat-flux method helped obtain accurate
trend of pressure exponent, b variation and its comparison with
kinetic model predictions for methane fuel. However, the exper-
imental data is limited to 5 atm pressure. Constant volume
method can help obtain measurements at higher pressures and
temperatures of practical importance for gas turbines and IC
engines. Focus required on developing the techniques for lami-
nar burning velocity measurement at these conditions and data
comparison across different measurement methods to enable
development of improved kinetic models. This is expected to
become a challenging task because usage of air as oxidizer
would result in highly unstable flames due to reduction in flame
thickness and extrapolation of results using helium gas would
be equally challenging.

4. Application of developed single component fuel kinetic mod-
els to complex hydrogen-enriched and multi-component sur-
rogate fuels finding applications in real engineering systems.
Simultaneous measurement of laminar burning velocity at
higher mixture temperatures and pressures will help in bet-
ter design of systems. Increased effort required to further
improve the constant volume spherical flame method as it
has shown the promise to measure laminar burning veloci-
ties at higher temperatures and pressures simultaneously.
