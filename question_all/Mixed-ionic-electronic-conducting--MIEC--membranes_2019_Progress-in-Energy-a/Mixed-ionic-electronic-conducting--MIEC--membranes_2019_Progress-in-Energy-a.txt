Intermediate temperature membrane-supported CO 2 thermochemical reduction using renewable energy
is a clean approach for reusing CO 2 . To implement this technology at scale, stable catalytic membrane
materials with fast kinetics should be developed, and reactor designs and system integrations should
be optimized. In this review, we highlight major advancements in experimental and numerical efforts
on mixed ionic-electronic conducting (MIEC) membrane-supported CO 2 thermochemical reduction, and
discuss the connection among materials, kinetics, membranes and reactor design. First, we discuss the
thermodynamics and kinetics of CO 2 reduction and the working principles of membrane reactors. Two
methods are compared: chemical looping (redox) and membrane supported CO 2  reduction. Next, we
compare CO 2 conversion rates on various membrane materials and their stability. Strontium based per-
ovskites, e.g., Nb 2 O 5 -doped SrCo 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3- δ (SCoF-82) show the highest CO 2 reduction rates so far, but
they suffer degradation mainly from carbonate formation. Mixed-phase membranes are promising, with
high reduction rates and good stability. Surface modification can enhance the reduction rates and increase
membrane stabilities. In order to accelerate the development in materials and membranes, kinetic param-
eters, e.g., conductivity and reaction rate constants should be obtained from high throughput benchtop
reactors complemented by reduced physical models. The mechanisms and transport models for surface
kinetics and bulk diffusion are summarized. Using these results, changes in membrane morphology and
surface chemistry are proposed. Finally, we summarize methods and system-scaled analysis to integrate
this membrane technology with renewable or waste heat sources for fuel production and energy storage.

1. Introduction

The  global  temperature  has  been  rising  over  the  past  few
decades,  and  2015–2017  have  been  the  hottest  years  on  record
[1] .  Even  though  global  energy-related  CO
2  emissions  have  lev-
eled off for three years, 2014–2016, the annual emission in 2017
increased by 1.4%, reaching 32.5 gigatonnes [2] , with the global av-
erage atmospheric CO
2 concentration climbing above 408 ppm [3] .
To counter these trends, the first universal climate agreement was
adopted by 195 countries in the 2015 Paris Climate Conference [4] .
Concerted efforts from various countries and sectors are being fo-
cused on keeping global warming well below 2 °C compared with
pre-industrial levels (e.g., China [5] and European Union [6,7] ). CO
2
capture and utilization, e.g., converting CO
2 to value-added chem-
icals such as CO, urea, salicylic acid and polyurethanes, has envi-
ronmental and economic benefits and can accelerate the transition
to low-carbon economy [8–12] .

Carbon dioxide is a very stable molecule; the average C = O bond
2 is highly en-

energy is 805 kJ mol −1 [13] . The dissociation of CO

If intermittent renewable energy sources are used for CO
duction to CO or C, the process can be viewed as an energy stor-
age technology. There are four promising methods for doing that:
electrochemical, photochemical, thermochemical and biochemical,
shown schematically in Fig. 1 and Table 1 . They are categorized
2  reduction, i.e., electricity, pho-
by the energy to activate the CO
ton, thermal energy and biology cultivation, respectively. Combi-
nations  of  any  two  of  these  technologies  have  also  been  pro-
posed, such as photo-electro-chemical (PEC) [14] , photo-bioreactor
[15] and electro-bioreactor [16] . These have all been demonstrated
at lab-scale, but breakthroughs such as efficiency improvement and
cost reduction are required before large-scale application becomes
possible. Examining the kinetic and transport phenomena in these
processes can reveal the rate-limiting steps and guide the design
and optimization of materials, reactors and systems. It is important
to develop frameworks of extracting valuable information such as
reaction rate constants from high throughput benchtop setups and
building physical models to simulate the processes.

Here we review the process of CO

2 thermochemical reduction
to  CO,  which  has  drawn  much  attention  in  recent  years  thanks
to  the  interest  of  solar  fuel  production  for  storage  of  renewable

Oxygen permeable membrane supported CO

2 .  We  focus  on  the  membrane-supported
energy  and  reusing  CO
2  reduction  and  discuss  the  kinetics  and  transport  models  to
CO
describe  processes.  Readers  who  are  interested  in  other  CO
2 -to-
chemical technologies in Fig. 1 can find relevant reviews in Table 1 .
2  thermochemical
reduction  was  proposed  in  1980s  as  a  clean  way  to  utilize  re-
newable  or  waste  heat  to  produce  useful  chemicals  [26] .  Mem-
branes operate in the temperature range of 70 0–10 0 0 °C with oxy-
gen fluxes in the orders of 0.01–10 μmol cm −2 s −1 [22] . By incor-
porating a perm-selective membrane in the CO
2 reduction process,
thermodynamics  equilibrium  on  the  feed  side  can  be  shifted  by
separating one of the products, that’s oxygen, and hence, lowering
the temperature required to achieve similar yields as that achieved
by direct thermolysis in the pure gas phase operation at tempera-
tures in the range 120 0–20 0 0 °C. Oxygen permeation is driven by
its partial pressure gradient across the membrane (or its chemi-
cal potential in the general case). In order to maintain low oxygen
partial pressure on the sweep side, different methods can be ap-
plied as shown in Fig. 2 (a): (1) using inert gas to sweep away the
produced oxygen; (2) using vacuum to maintain a low total pres-
sure; (3) using fuels to consume oxygen by full or partial oxidation.
2  reduction  on  the  feed  side  is  impacted  by  the  oxygen  par-
CO
tial pressure gradient, as shown in Fig. 2 (b). Different applications
have been proposed in which CO
2 reduction in an oxygen perme-
able membrane is integrated with other synergistic processes. One
2  in the combus-
option is using renewable energy to convert CO
tion products of fossil fuel power plants back into fuels, which is
schematically shown in Fig. 2 (c).

In  this  review,  we  first  discuss  the  thermodynamics  and  ki-
2 thermolysis in the gas phase or using metal oxides
netics of CO
at  elevated  temperatures.  We  compare  two  thermochemical  CO
2
reduction technologies: chemical looping (redox) and membrane-
supported  CO
2  reduction.  Next,  we  focus  on  the  latter  technol-
ogy, and summarize membrane materials, categorized into single
phase (fluorite or perovskite) and mixed phase materials. Material
synthesis, membrane fabrication and surface modifications are dis-
cussed as they can impact conversion rates and stability. Kinetics
including charged species diffusion, reaction mechanisms and rate
constants are reviewed. System integration for solar-fuel produc-
tion, and system analysis are summarized. In order to accelerate
technology development, attention should be focused on extract-
ing  material  and  membrane  characteristics,  e.g.,  surface  reaction
rates and bulk diffusivity, from high throughput experiments and
physical models. The selection of transport models will also be dis-
cussed, which depends on the operating conditions and the rate-
limiting steps.

2.1. Thermodynamics of CO 2 dissociation

Homogeneous gas-phase CO

2 thermal dissociation, or thermol-
ysis,  operates  at  temperatures  much  higher  than  1200 °C,  con-
strained by thermodynamic equilibrium [27] . Fig. 3 shows the gas

Heat at these temperatures could be supplied by concentrated
solar field with high concentration ratios (parabolic, tower or dish

tem can operate with values as high as 20% [29] . The lower effi-
ciency could be due to product recombination and lower CO pro-
duction in the reaction zone of 2350 °C (12% instead of the ideal
19%), showing the thermodynamics and kinetics limitations of the

splitting process. Moreover, heat loss and performance degradation
are among the major concerns of high temperature concentrated
solar plants. And the cost of the solar concentrator increases with
the operating temperature and solar concentration ratio [28] .

To  overcome  the  equilibrium  limitations  in  the  homogeneous
gas  phase,  methods  to  shift  the  equilibrium,  prevent  products

branes  [33–36]  and  oxide  catalysts  [27] .  Quenching  and  heat-
exchanger  loops  have  lower  process  efficiency.  To  accelerate  the
kinetics, oxide catalysts including perovskites and fluorites, such as
2 and CeO
LaFe
2 , were used in fixed
0.25 O

bed reactors [27] . For example, CO
2  reduction rates catalyzed by
2 (fixed bed) were higher by a factor of 1.89
2 and CeO
Ce
and 1.57 times of the rate without catalysts at 1300 °C, respectively
[27] . Alternatively, CO
2  reduction can be done using the reduced
metals or oxides in one reactor, while the reduction of the metal
oxides  is  done  in  a  different  reactor.  On  the  other  hand,  high-
temperature perm-selective membranes can separate the products
in situ, and hence, shift the equilibrium on the feed side. In this
case, the CO
2  reduction process is done on the feed side of the
membrane which oxygen is collected on the permeate side (sweep
side). These last two processes are described in more detail next.

2.2. CO 2 thermochemical reduction

In  the  two  thermochemical  processes,  that  is  chemical  loop-
ing and membrane supported reduction, mentioned above and in
Fig. 5 , CO
2 reduction occurs heterogeneously at the solid-gas inter-
face at 70 0–10 0 0 °C, facilitated by oxygen vacancies, electron holes
or  electrons.  In  this  section,  we  compare  these  two  approaches
(summarized in Table 3 ).

Both experimental and numerical methods can be used to ob-
tain  the  (cid:3)G (cid:7) 0
ox (T )  for  different  complex  oxides.  Recently,  high-
throughput ab initio computations, e.g., the density functional the-
ory (DFT) [46,47] have been used to evaluate (cid:3)G of oxidation reac-
tions of fluorites, perovskites and spinels. By comparing the Gibbs
free energy values in the Ellingham diagram, the favorable operat-
ing temperatures for these compounds can be determined.

Experiments  are  performed  to  evaluate  the  kinetics  of  redox
processes,  which  determines  the  reactor  dimensions  and  system
designs.  In  redox  cycles  at  elevated  temperatures,  particle  prop-
erties such as sizes and surface areas evolve, and these structural
changes affect the apparent kinetic parameters [48] . Furthermore,
the desired shapes and sizes of the particle depend on the reactor
design, e.g., fluidized bed [49] or rotary [50,51] . Intrinsic kinetics
models involve oxygen transport between the gas phase and the
solid surface, and between the surfaces and the bulk. Zhao et al.
[39,52,53] developed a kinetic model for CO

also shows that the splitting rate is impacted by the interactions
between the surface defects and the adsorbates.

2.2.2. Membrane supported CO 2 reduction

In the case of a membrane, the redox pair takes place on the
feed and sweep sides, as shown in Fig. 5 (b), while lattice oxygen
diffuses across without imposing an external electric potential. The
separation of oxygen from CO shifts the equilibrium of the splitting
reaction by preventing product recombination, and hence, further
2 reduction can be achieved. The membranes are often very thin
CO
and highly thermally conductive and the temperature is almost the
same on both sides. Oxygen separation membranes have been used
for air separation under nonreactive conditions, when the sweep
gas is nonreactive with oxygen, and reactive conditions, when us-
ing a fuel on the sweep side [54] . They have also been proposed
for water splitting [55,56] .

The first proof-of-concept study on membrane-supported CO
2
reduction dates back to 1986, when a Japanese team reported us-
0.1  at 1427–
ing tubular calcium stabilized zirconia, (ZrO
1727 °C [26] . This membrane was also used for water splitting at
1800 °C with concentrated solar energy [34,57] . The high operating
temperature requires high solar concentration ratios, and the effi-
ciency can drop at high temperatures as a result of the heat loss.
Since then, membrane materials that work at lower temperatures,
around 900 °C, have been developed. The figures of merit (FOM) of
these membranes are summarized as follows:

lower than the temperature at the intersection of the (cid:3)G (cid:7) 0

on the CO
2 side and its desorption on the sweep/permeate
side, and the ambipolar diffusion of oxygen ions/vacancies
and  electrons/holes  across  the  membrane,  as  well  as  the
oxygen potential gradient across the membrane [56] ;

(2) Active  surface  area :  Surface  reactions  on  both  sides  can,
in some cases, be the limiting steps for oxygen permeation
[58–60] . CO
2 reduction depends on surface reactions such as
adsorption, desorption and oxygen incorporation reaction;
(3) Chemical,  thermal  and  mechanical  stabilities :  As  the
membrane operates at elevated temperatures, material sta-
bility during heating/cooling and under long term operations
is of great importance for industrial applications. The reduc-
O2 can be
ing environment on both feed and sweep sides ( P
as low as 10 −20 –10 −15 bar under equilibrium conditions) can
also induce membrane material reduction or cation segrega-
tions, which can lead to membrane failures. Moreover, since
a total pressure gradient can be used to enhance the perme-
ation flux subjecting the membrane to stresses, mechanical
stability is also important;

(4) Cost :  Large  membrane  surface  areas  are  required,  typical
oxygen permeation fluxes are O(0.1–1 μmol cm −2 s −1 ). Ex-
pensive  materials  such  as  cobalt  should  be  avoided  and
Earth abundant elements are favorable. The cost of fabrica-
tion and assembly must be competitively low;

(5) Operating temperature : High operating temperature leads
to  higher  surface  reaction  kinetics  and  better  oxygen  per-
meability. But it also means higher maintenance and oper-
ational  costs,  and  more  expensive  insulation  materials  are
required to decrease the heat lost and gas leak. Optimiza-
tion is required to have the reactor operate at appropriate
temperatures to achieve the best performances.

2.2.3. Comparison between these two processes

Both  chemical  looping  (redox)  and  membrane-supported  CO
2
reduction processes involve oxidation and reduction reactions. In
the first case, redox reactions take place sequentially by transport-
ing the oxygen carriers between different reactors or changing the
stream inputs into the same reactor, and the reaction rates can be
time dependent due to the consumption and production of oxygen
vacancies in the oxidation and reduction reactions, respectively. On
the other hand, in a membrane reactor, redox reactions occur si-
multaneously  on  the  two  sides  of  the  membrane.  Under  steady
state operation, the oxygen vacancy concentrations on the feed or
sweep sides are constant, but different.

In chemical looping, oxygen transport occurs at different scales,
depending on the reactor design. If the OC is transported between
different reactors, e.g., rotary reactors [50,51] and fluidized bed re-
actors [49] , oxygen is transported with the OCs at the macro scale
and between the surface and the bulk of the particles at the mi-
cro scale. If the oxygen carriers are fixed, e.g., in fixed bed reac-
tors [37] , redox is achieved by switching the oxidizing and reduc-
ing gas streams, and only diffusion between the surface and the
bulk of the particles should be considered. On the other hand, in
a membrane reactor, oxygen diffuses from the feed to the sweep
side, driven by the chemical potential gradient, not requiring mov-
ing the particles or switching the gas streams.

Additionally,  the  operating  temperatures  for  the  two  reactors
in  redox  CO
2  splitting  can  be  different  to  favor  the  thermody-
namics  and  kinetics  of  reduction  or  oxidation.  However,  operat-
ing the two reactors at different temperatures may not be optimal
for the efficiency of the overall system. For instance, analysis of a
system incorporating a rotary reactor (for oxy combustion) shows
that isothermal operation can lead to better exergy efficiency [61] .
The operating pressures for the two reactors are usually the same.
On the other hand, the membrane reactor mostly operates under
isothermal condition across the feed and sweep sides, and there

can be a temperature-gradient from the inlet to outlet of the mem-
brane reactor depending on the heat integration methods. Yet the
pressures on both sides can be different. Having the feed side pres-
sure higher than the sweep side pressure can improve the perme-
ation by increasing the driving force for oxygen permeation across
the  membrane.  Consideration  of  the  dependence  of  kinetics  and
product selectivity on pressure should also be given when selecting
different operating pressures on the two sides in the membrane.

Both  processes  have  been  identified  as  potential  technologies
for the solar-fuel production that is using solar energy in the form
of heat (or electricity) to reduce water or carbon dioxide back into
fuels, i.e., hydrogen or carbon monoxide, respectively. This review
focuses on the membrane supported reduction technology, and we
will discuss the materials and kinetics in the membrane reactors
in details in the following sections.

3. Current state of membrane-supported CO 2 reduction

2 −δ),  perovskite  (ABO

Oxygen permeable membranes are built from mixed ionic and
electronic conducting (MIEC) materials, which can be either single-
phase or mixed-phase. An MIEC material exhibits both ionic and
electronic conductivity; for practical applications, the conductivi-
ties should be higher than 10 −4 –10 −3 S cm −1 [66] . A general dis-
cussion on these membrane materials and applications, mainly for
oxygen separation, can be found in [67] . In this section we will

as  fluorite  (chemical  formula:  AO
mixed-phase. Here, A and B are different metal cations in the flu-
orites or perovskite structures. Membrane separation can operate
in two modes: non-reactive or reactive sweep. In the first, inert
gases,  such  as  argon and  nitrogen are  used  to  sweep the  mem-
brane surface and decrease the oxygen partial pressure. In some
cases, vacuum is used to decrease the sweep side total pressure
as well. The outcome of the non-reactive mode is a co-production
of CO and O
2  in two separate streams (see Fig. 2 (a)). In the sec-
ond, fuels such as hydrogen or methane are used to react with the
permeated oxygen, further decreasing the oxygen potential on that
side. In this case, the overall reactions are reverse water gas shift
and methane dry reforming, respectively, but with the production
of separate streams of CO on the feed side and water/syngas on the
sweep side. While hydrogen is used as a surrogate fuel in some
experimental studies, in practice and unless renewable hydrogen
is available at low cost, other fuels should be used. In both hydro-
gen or methane sweep cases, the overall reaction in the membrane
reactor is endothermic, and CO
2  reduction can be thought of as

The Arrhenius plots of the performances of some membranes are
shown in Fig. 7 , where all the cases correspond to reactive sweep
and parameters such as the membrane thickness, sweep conditions
and  catalysts  are  shown.  Material  synthesis  and  membrane  fab-
rication techniques for these oxygen permeable membranes, and
their stability are also summarized. The chemical kinetics in the
processes, e.g., reaction mechanisms, defect chemistry and charged
species diffusion will be discussed in the next section.

3.1. Materials and membrane performance

As mentioned above, oxygen permeable materials can be cate-
gorized as fluorite, perovskite and mixed-phase materials. Fluorite-
2  (A = Ce 4 + ,  Ze 4 + ,  etc.)  oxides  are  good  ionic  conduc-
type  AO
tors  used  extensively  in  oxygen  sensors  and  fuel  cells  [74] .  Yet
they are mainly ionic conductors and their electronic conductiv-
ity  is  very  low,  so  they  are  usually  mixed  with  other  conduc-

sweep case, Itoh et al. [80] tested a 2 mm thick yttria-stabilized
zirconia (YSZ, 6 mol% Y
3 ) tube with maximum temperature at
1509 °C and measured the maximum CO production rate with Ar
sweep to be 0.488 μmol cm −2 s − 1 . Recently, Tou et al. [65] tested
a ceria membrane reactor with inert sweep gas in a solar simula-
tor. The maximum CO production rate was 0.01 μmol cm −2 s − 1 at
160 0 °C with 350 0 suns radiation. In most cases, the measured CO
production rates were around 10 times lower than the theoretical
limits that are calculated by equilibrating the feed side CO
2  con-
centration and the oxygen partial pressure on the sweep side at
the corresponding operating temperature. The difference between
the actual and ideal performance means that reactor optimization
with the solar concentrator is necessary.

Factors such as flow rates and temperature can affect CO

2 con-
version, and should be optimized to achieve best performance. For
the 2-mm thick YSZ (6 mol% Y
3 ) tube, it was found that with
2 O
increasing CO
2  flow rate, its conversion first decreases, increases
then decreases again. In the first and third regimes, the reason is
mainly due to the drop in the residence time, while in the mid-
dle regime, the drop of temperature near the outlet of the tubular
membrane reduces recombination and hence, increases CO
2  con-
version [80] .

The electronic conductivity of fluorites is generally lower than
their ionic conductivity, which can be the rate-limiting step. Ni-
gara  and  Cales  [26]  compared  a  calcia-stabilized  zirconia  mem-
brane and a 20 mol% CeO
2 -doped YSZ membrane. The latter was
found to have higher CO production rates (under CO sweep condi-
tion), mainly due to its higher electronic conductivity [26] .

Both conductivities depend on the charged species concentration

such as oxygen partial pressures and operating temperatures. More
about the charged species and conductivity will be discussed later
in this paper. Other Ruddlesden–Popper phase materials such as

contain more than one phase, with each phase exhibiting a domi-
nant conductivity. For these, the dominant conductivity of different

2 and TiO

Fluorites usually exhibit high ionic yet low electronic conduc-
tivity. Adding dopants can modify their conductivity and stability.
Taking zirconia as an example, dopants such as CeO
2 can
enhance  their  electronic  conductivity,  while  other  dopants  such
as CaO and Y
3  are essential for the stability of its cubic phase
[54] .  Additionally,  the  operating  temperature  and  oxygen  partial
pressure also affect the electronic conductivity. For example, pure
CeO
2  exhibits  higher  electronic  conductivity  at  higher  tempera-
tures; with decreasing oxygen partial pressure from 0.21 atm to
as low as 10 −20 atm, the electronic conductivity first remains con-
stant and then increases after a threshold partial pressure, which
depends on the operating temperature [79] .

Doped fluorite membranes were initially proposed to support
H

earliest experimental studies were on fluorite-based single phase
membranes with either reactive or non-reactive sweep [26,80] . Ni-
gara and Cales [26] tested 2-mm thick tubular calcia-stabilized zir-
2 ) membranes at 1427–1727 °C with CO as the
conia (10 mol% CaO
sweep gas. They found that CO
2 reduction rate increased with re-
spect to temperature and fuel concentration. The highest rate was
0.62 μmol cm −2 s − 1 at 1727 °C with 99% CO. For the non-reactive

Hence, in the Ellingham diagram, at the conditions where the
dotted line ( (cid:3)μC O

P o  of the de-
composition of a certain carbonate), the carbonate decomposition
is thermodynamically favorable. We will discuss the material sta-
bility and reaction mechanisms in details in the corresponding sec-
tions later.

2  feed,  4.8  mol%  CH

Another method to improve the stability of the membrane is
by  adding  porous  layers  on  its  surfaces,  which  can  protect  the
dense membrane against corrosive gases by physically decreasing
the contacts. For example, the bare 0.5wt% Nb
5 doped SCoF-82
(SCoFNb) membrane without porous layers maintained high per-
formances  for  35  h  (16.7  mol%  CO
4  sweep
at  900 °C);  carbonates  were  found  on  the  CO
2  feed  side,  and
unidentified materials on the CH
4  sweep side (by XRD) [68] . By

1.0 mm  thick  SCoFNb  membrane  showed  stable  performance  for

Another example is that Zhang et al. [83] studied how a SCoFZ-451
porous layer impacted the stability of the SCoFZ-451 membrane.
They found that when the layer was added to the feed or sweep
sides, the membrane lasted for ∼3.2 and 1.7 times longer, respec-
tively, than the unmodified membrane under the same operating
conditions (20% CO

2.68 μmol cm −2 s − 1 at 950 °C (20% CO

This shows that the sweep side methane oxidation was the rate-
limiting step in their setup. By adding catalysts on both sides, (i.e.,
3  on the sweep side),

Dopants such as Al and La which are less prone to forming car-
bonates  have  been  added  to  increase  the  stability  of  strontium-
based perovskites. A 0.6 mm thick Al-doped SCoF-82 tubular mem-
brane  was  tested  at  900 °C  with  20  mol%  CO
2  feed  and  5mol%
CH
4 sweep, and the membrane maintained stable performance for
62  h  before  it  broke  [70] .  LSCoF-6428  membranes  also  exhibit
high  stability  towards  carbonate  formation,  but  its  performance
was  much  lower  compared  with  the  SCoFZ-451.  A  0.6 mm  thick
LSCoF-6428 membrane exhibited a maximum CO production rate
of 0.28 μmol cm −2 s −1 at 1030 °C with 10% CH
4 in the sweep gas
[73] . Higher temperature raised the CO
2 splitting rate on the feed
4  conversion ratio on the sweep side. Yet amor-
side and the CH
phous  graphite  was  detected  on  the  LSCoF-6428  membrane  by
XRD after experiments, as a result of methane cracking [73] .

Calcium-based perovskites can also be used because of the rela-
tively unstable calcium carbonates at high temperatures (shown in
the Ellingham diagram in Fig. 8 ). Wu and Ghoniem tested 1.3 mm
thick LCaF-91 membranes for the CO
2  thermochemical reduction
with fuel sweep, and the membrane showed more than 100 h of
stable performance [58,71] . The maximum CO production rates re-
ported were 0.38 and 0.32 μmol cm −2 s −1 with 9.5 mol% H
2 and
11.6 mol% CO sweep at 990 °C, respectively [58] .

Apart from protecting the dense membrane, a porous layer can
also increase the number of active sites and/or catalyze the surface
reactions, and can improve the performance if surface reactions are
the rate limiting steps. Zhang et al. [83] applied porous SCoFZ-451
layers onto different sides of a dense SCoFZ-451 membrane, and
found that the porous layer on either side can slightly enhance the
CO
2 reduction rate, especially at low temperatures around 800 °C.
Adding the porous layer onto the feed side led to a better perfor-
mance than adding it onto the sweep side, and the difference was
more  obvious  at  higher  temperatures  [83] .  For  the  1.3 mm  thick
LCaF-91 membrane, the CO production rate was enhanced by 1.4
times by putting porous LCaF-91 layers on both sides of the mem-
brane  at  990 °C  (100% CO
2  feed,  1–8%  CO  sweep)  [71] .  The  per-
formance was further improved by adding 20 mol% CZO/LCaF-91
and 20 mol% (La
3 /LCaF-91 porous layers on
0.2 Fe
the feed and sweep sides, respectively, with one order of magni-
tude improvements at lower temperatures around 850 °C [71] .

sion ratios, and CO selectivity from methane oxidation all increased

4 conversion ratio but higher CO se-
at the inlet leads to lower CH
lectivity on the same membrane. And increasing CO

tions on the feed side leads to higher oxygen fluxes and methane
conversion, but the CO

niques, and performance measurements such as the reactor setup,
measurement uncertainties, and sampling locations should be re-
ported in details. In this section, we will discuss how these factors
can impact the membrane performance measurements, and hence
can lead to uncertainties when evaluating the materials, catalysts
and membrane configurations.

3.2.1. Material synthesis

Material preparation methods result in unique microstructures,
e.g., grain sizes and grain boundary length that impact their elec-
tronic  and  ionic  conductivities.  Generally,  there  are  five  meth-
ods  to  synthesis  the  oxide  powders  [92] :  solid  state  reaction,
co-precipitation, sol-gel, hydrothermal synthesis, and spray/freeze
drying.  New  methods  such  as  flame  synthesis  of  functional  par-
ticles are under development [93] . Kharton and Marques [94] re-
viewed the relationship between the microstructures and charged
species  transport  in  oxides  and  found  that  for  microcrystalline
solid-electrolyte materials with predominant electronic transport,
larger  grain  size  often  leads  to  higher  ionic  conductivity.  More
recently,  Saher  et  al.  [95]  investigated  the  apparent  oxygen  dif-
fusion and surface exchange coefficients of undoped or Zr-doped
3 −δ (BSCoF-5582) for oxygen transport during
Ba
long term high temperature annealing. They found that the coeffi-
cients of all the membranes dropped with the annealing duration,
but membranes with larger grain sizes experienced less deteriora-
tion probably because less non-conducting secondary phase were
formed in the grain boundaries. Hence, factors such as the steps of
material synthesis and membrane manufacture procedures as well
as  the  resulting  membrane  morphologies,  such  as  surface  struc-
ture and grain size, all impact the reproducibility of the results.
On  the  other  hand,  controlling  the  evolution  of  these  oxide  mi-
crostructures, such as optimizing the grain size [95] and exsolving
nano-catalysts [96] , can provide new opportunities to enhance the
material performances.

Here,  we  briefly  summarize  the  three  methods  used  to  pre-
pare the membranes listed in Table 6 . A comparison on the par-
ticle properties synthesized by these methods and the correspond-
ing membranes are shown in Table 4 . More information about the
particle synthesis method can be found in [67,92] .

3.2.1.1. Solid  state  reaction.  Solid  state  reaction,  or  the  mixed-
powders technique, is the most common approach to produce ce-
ramic  particles  [54] .  Oxides,  carbonates,  hydroxides  or  salts  are
weighed according to the cation stoichiometric ratios, mixed and
ball-milled  up  to  two  days.  Organic  liquids,  such  as  methanol
[97]  and  isopropyl  alcohol  [98]  are  applied  to  the  solid  mixture
to increase its homogeneity. After milling, the dried mixture is cal-
cined at high temperatures. The calcined temperature depends on
the materials. For example, the mixture to synthesize Nb doped
SrCo
3 −δ particles was calcined in air at 950 °C for 5 h [68] ,
0.2 O
3 −δ was calcined in air at 900 °C for
while the one for SrCo
10 h [99] . During this calcination process, the cations diffuse in the
mixture to form the desired stable crystals [100] . The particle size
distribution is usually wide and ball-milling is required to make
finer ceramic particles for further processing. The homogeneity and
purity of the ceramic powders prepared by the solid state reac-
tion method are usually poor [92] . Besides, energy requirements
for ball-milling is high as well as for the high temperature calcina-
tion.

mixed with the precipitating agent. After mixing, a series of pro-
cesses  such  as  filtration,  drying  and  thermal  decomposition  are

performed. For example, Jeon et al. [101] prepared LaNiO

powders using this method. Stoichiometric fractions of cation pre-
cursors, in this case lanthanum acetate hydrate and nickel acetate
tetrahydrate,  were  dissolved  in  distilled  water  and  mixed  thor-
oughly. The precipitating agent, that is ammonium hydroxide, was
added to adjust the pH level to 10 for precipitation. After filtra-
tion, washing and drying, the precipitate was calcined at elevated
temperature to form the desired LNO crystals, and the calcination
temperature  could  be  determined  by  thermogravimetric  analysis
[102] . The particle morphology and purities can be well controlled
by the pH, mixing rate, thermal decomposition temperature, and
cation concentrations in the solution. Doping agents can be added
to avoid composition inhomogeneity [54] . As the temperatures for
co-precipitation are lower than the solid-state reactions, less en-

non-silicate ceramics has been under development since 1948 for
preparing functional oxides such as titanate or mixed cation per-
ovskites [54] . It provides excellent composition control and the re-
sulting ceramic particles are of very high purity. Different routes
are adopted, such as the all-alkoxide method, alkoxide-salt citrate-
type method and hydrous oxide solutions [92] . Generally, an amor-
phous gel is produced from the cation precursors, e.g., metal ni-
trates and metal alkoxides, with the addition of a chelating agent,
e.g., glycine, citric acid and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).
Polymerization promoters such as ethylene glycol can also be ap-
plied to control the gel formation. After the gel is formed, it is de-
hydrated at low temperature and then calcined at high tempera-
ture to form the desired oxides. Sol-gel method has been success-
fully applied to produce functional oxides with high purity, such as
samarium-doped CeO
2 reduction applica-
2 [72] membranes for CO
tions.

3.2.2. Membrane fabrication

The membrane fabrication, especially the porous layer fabrica-
tion  methods  impact  the  membrane  performance,  by  impacting
the  pore  morphologies  and  transport  properties  such  as  poros-
ity,  constriction  factor  and  tortuosity.  There  are  generally  three
steps to fabricate a membrane: shaping, sintering and reprocess-
ing  [67] .  Various  shaping  approaches  have  been  used  to  fabri-
cate the porous supports, e.g., hydrothermal process [103] , screen-
printing [104] , freeze casting [105,106] , and phase-inversion [107] .
The Thiele Modulus, φ, can be used to evaluate the kinetics prop-
erties of the porous layer, and it is defined as the ratio of the re-
action rate over the diffusion rate in the porous layer [71,108] ,

surf  is  the  overall  reaction  rate  on  the  porous  surface,
AB,e  is  the  effective  diffusivity  between  gas

species A and B, [cm 2  s −1 ], and C
A0  is the concentration of gas
species A on the membrane surface, [mol cm −3 ], L c is characteris-
tic length of the porous layer, [cm], i.e., the layer thickness, and J
O2
is the oxygen flux, [mol cm −2 s −1 ]. Rachadel et al. [109] found the
connections of the pores to be very important to effectively trans-
fer the gas species in and out of the membrane surface, and in
some cases when the openings of the pores are narrow, the porous
support had a negative impact on the oxygen flux across the mem-
brane. Hence, porous layers with finger-like pores are preferred to
decrease the concentration polarization. Fabrication methods such
as freeze-casting [105,106] , and phase-inversion [107] can be used
to produce these elongated pores as shown in Fig. 10 .

In the following, four conventional shaping methods are sum-
marized, and compared in Table 4 . More information about mem-
brane fabrication methods can be found in [67] .

3.2.2.4. Dry-pressing.  Pressing is a straightforward method to pre-
pare  membranes  with  simple  geometries  such  as  plates  and
closed-one-end  (COE)  tubes.  The  as-synthesized  particles  are
ground and pressed in a uniaxial or isostatic press in a mold (rub-
ber  or  stainless  steel)  into  desired  tubes  or  plates  [110,111] .  For
two-phase membranes, mixing of different phases is required be-
fore  pressed,  and  binders  such  as  polyninyl  alcohol  can  also  be
added [112] . In order to make a porous surface, graphite or organic
particles are mixed with the functional material particles as pore
formers [59] . For example, Wu et al. [59] prepared a porous LCaF-
91  layer  by  mixing  its  powers  with  graphite  powders  ( < 20 μm,
Sigma-Aldrich®)  at  50vol%  with  a  mortar  and  pestle  for  twenty
minutes, then compressed the mixture into a flat circular plate at
10 t-force for 1 min. After sintering at 1450 °C for 30 min, a porous
substrate with pore size on the order of several micrometers was
produced.

3.2.2.5. Plastic  extrusion.  Plastic  extrusion  is  usually  applied  to
fabricate  tubular  membranes.  First,  a  mixture  with  good  plas-
ticity,  known  as  a  ‘slip’,  consisting  of  ceramic  particles  and  or-
ganic additives, i.e., a solvent, a dispersant, a binder and a plas-
ticizer is prepared [113] . Then the slip undergoes solvent evapora-
tion and extrusion to form tubular membranes. For example, Zhu
et al. [114] prepared a 0.3 mm thick tubular SrCo
3 −δ
(SCoFZ-451) membrane for water splitting using a slip with a mix-
ture of 76wt% SCoFZ-451 powder, 10wt% polyvinyl alcohol solution,
10wt% dextrin and 4wt% tung oil.

3.2.2.6. Phase-inversion spinning.  Phase-inversion spinning is sim-
ilar to plastic extrusion, as both are derived from polymer fabri-
cations and used to prepare tubular membranes. In this method,
ceramics  powders  are  mixed  with  organic  solutions  to  form  a
slurry,  which  is  spun  through  a  spinneret  to  form  green  tubu-
lar membranes [84,115] . Jiang et al. [84] prepared 0.17 mm thick

was  cut  into  0.5 m  pieces  and  sintered  in  a  hanging  geometry
at  1320 °C  for  5 h.  After  sintering,  a  thin  dense  membrane  with

3.2.2.7. Painting or coating.  Painting or coating is an effective ap-
proach  to  fabricate  thin  film  membranes  on  a  porous  support,
while the porous support is prepared by sintering a mixture of ce-
ramic particles and combustible particles using methods described
above. The slurry for painting usually consists of the functional ox-
ide powders, a binder, a plasticizer, poly-vinyl butyral, α-terpineol
[116] . After the slurry is painted onto the substrate, the asymmet-
ric membrane is dried and sintered to form a dense thin film on
the porous support. Park et al. [116] painted a 0.05 mm thick dense
La
3 −δ (LSCuF-7328) thin film membrane on the
porous substrates with the same perovskite material. The sample
was  then  dried  at  80 °C  for  1  h  and  heated  at  1100–1140 °C  for
10 h in air.

3.2.3. Test reactor designs and experimental setups

Test reactor designs impact the performance measurements in
the lab, especially near the membrane surface. For a button cell re-
actor which is often used in lab-scale tests, the membrane can ex-
perience radial gas concentration variation as shown in Fig. 11 (a)–

(c). Gozalvez-Zafrilla et al. [62] carried out a computational fluid
dynamics (CFD) simulation of the oxygen partial pressure on the
sweep  side  (inert sweep)  of  a  membrane reactor  for  air  separa-
tion. They found the oxygen concentration varying along the ra-
dius, which is impacted by the sweep gas flow rate and the gap
between  the  feeding  tube  of  the  sweep  gas  and  the  membrane
( Fig. 11 (c)). Larger gap and smaller sweep gas flow rate increase
the homogeneity of the gas concentration, but decrease the oxy-
gen flux. In order to maintain a constant gas concentration on the
membrane surface, Ghoniem and colleagues [117–119] built a stag-
nation flow reactor as shown in Fig. 11 (d). The planar, finite-gap
stagnation flow configuration (Hiemenz flow, Fig. 11 (e)) has a self-
similar flow field near the membrane surface, and the temperature
and gas species concentration vary only in the direction normal to
the membrane (assuming no gas phase reaction).

When  more  complex  fuels  such  as  methane,  ethane  and
methanol are used on the sweep side, the gas phase reactions can-
not be neglected. Wu et al.  [59,71] used a micro-probe to sam-
ple the gas close to the surface, and compared them with values
measured at the reactor outlet. They found gas phase reactions to
contribute greatly to the final products. In water splitting or CO
2
reduction, when methane is used on the sweep side, full oxida-
tion is more favorable near the membrane surface; as gas products
2 reform the un-
travel from the surface to the outlet, H
reacted methane, and the products at the outlet have a H
2 /CO ra-
tio closer to the stoichiometric values of partial oxidation products.
While the overall performance can be deduced from the inlet and

3.3. Material stability

Oxygen permeable membranes that can work stably in a CO
2
environment  have  been  investigated  for  air  separation  or  oxy-
fuel  combustion.  A  recent  detailed  review  of  this  topic  can  be
found in Zhang et al. [22] . Carbonates on the sweep side surface
were found to decrease the oxygen permeation across the mem-
brane  [120] .  For  example,  Tong  et  al.  [121]  found  that  carbon-
ates  formed  on  the  BCoFZ  membrane  surfaces  exposed  to  pure
2 environment, but the carbonate decomposed when the mem-
CO
2 + 99%Ar for an hour at 800 °C. Similarly,
brane was exposed to 1%O
Kovalevsky  et  al.  [120]  found  that  when  the  sweep  gas  was
switched from inert gases to CO
2 , the oxygen flux through BSCoF-
5582 decreased, because of the formation of carbonates on the sur-
3 −δ (BCoFNb)  also  suffered  from  carbon-
face.  BaCo
ate  formation  that  leads  to  lower  oxygen  flux  with  CO
2  sweep
[122,123] . The Ellingham diagrams (shown in Fig. 8 ) is often used
to examine the potential of carbonate formation on the membrane
surface [85] , and the tendency for carbonate formation increases in
the order of Ca 2 + < Sr 2 + < Ba 2 + .

3 are ready to decompose
under low CO
2 partial pressure and high temperature, carbonates
were still found on the surfaces of Sr- and Ca-based perovskites

following the experiments. For example, SrCO

were identified with XRD on the feed surface and SrZrO
3  on the
sweep surface, after the SCoFZ-451 membrane broke in a 33-hour

4 on the sweep side at 900 °C [83] . For LCaF-91, impurities such
CH
as  FeCO
5  were  found  on  the  feed  surface,  but
these impurities had hardly any impact on the performances for
CO
2 on the feed side, and
2  or CO on the sweep side at 990 °C [58] . These results
1–12% H
show the limitation of using the Ellingham diagram based only on
2 chemical potential to discover stable
carbonate formation and CO
membranes.  The  gas  environment  in  CO
2  reduction  experiments
can  be  more  complicated  and  the  carbonate  formation  mecha-
nism can be related with other factors such as the cation diffu-
sion and oxygen evolution from the surface. For example, Yi et al.
[124] examined the carbonate formation on BaCo
3 −δ
( x = 0.2–0.8, y = 0.2) membranes by annealing them in various CO
2
environments. They found that the tendency for carbonate forma-
2  <  30%
tion  increases  in  the  order  of:  30%  CO

2 reduction during 106 h with 100% CO

Ba 2 + is diffused to the surface. This Ba 2 + outward diffusion mech-
anism  was  confirmed  by  a  recent  DFT  study  on  CO

3  [125] . However, the opposite trend is found on SCoF-
on BaZrO

82, as the amount of carbonates dropped with increasing O

centrations when the perovskite powders were annealed in O

mixtures (p
2 sweep
formed in the presence of oxygen, the case with 5%O
2 /CO
leads to more stable oxygen permeation rates than pure CO
2 sweep
case  [126] .  More  careful  examinations,  especially  in  situ  surface
characterizations, are required to understand the carbonate forma-
tion and CO

2 reduction mechanisms.

On the other hand, during CO

2 reduction, the formation of CO
on that side influences carbonate formation by changing the Lewis
acidity  (electron  acceptor)  and  basicity  (electron  donor)  of  the
oxide surface [127] . For an oxide, the acidity and basicity are at-
tributed to the surface cations (M n + ) and anions (O 2 −), respectively
[128] . The number of acid and basic sites can be probed by the
NH
2 adsorption experiments, respectively. Other methods
such as infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS), low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) and tempera-

3 and CO

ture programmed desorption/reduction (TPD/TPR) can also be ap-
plied  to  characterize  the  surface  acid  and  base  sites  [129] .  Gen-
erally, higher oxidation states or higher binding energy for lattice
oxygen are related to lower basicity [22] , which means less prone
to CO
2 adsorption or carbonate formation. For example, the acid-
ity decreases in the order of Nb 5 + > Co 4 + > Fe 4 + > Co 3 + > Fe 3 +
>  Co 2 +  >  Fe 2 + ,  so  the  doping  of  Nb 5 +  in  the  perovskite  struc-
ture can decrease the carbonate formation tendency [124] . How-
ever, lowering basicity also means increasing the oxygen bonding
energy and decreasing the oxygen vacancies available and hence,
the  oxygen  diffusivity  of  the  membrane  drops  [130,131] .  For  ex-
ample,  dopants  such  as  Al 3 +  were  added  into  SCoFZ-451  mem-
branes  to  increase  their  resistance  towards  carbonate  formation,
but the performance dropped compared with undoped membranes
[70] . In addition, higher basicity increases CO adsorption capabil-
ity, which induces carbonate formation from CO. It was found that
with increasing basicity along the series MgO, CaO and SrO, the
adsorption  capacity  of  CO  on  the  oxide  surface  increases  [132] .
Higher operating temperatures or reducing environments leads to
lower oxidation states of the oxides or more oxygen vacancies and
2 /CO adsorption
hence, increases the basicity. As a result, more CO

18

X.-Y. Wu and A.F. Ghoniem / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 74 (2019) 1–30

will  occur  on  the  oxide  surface  at  higher  temperatures  or  more
reducing environment. For example, with increasing the temper-
3  surfaces  with  CO
ature,  more  basic  sites  were  found  on  SrTiO
2
adsorption  microcalorimetry  measurements  [133] .  Similar  results
are also shown in LaMnO
3  that with high pretreatment temper-
atures,  more  oxygen-deficient  surfaces  (basic  sites)  are  available,
and hence, more CO
2  are adsorbed on the surface [134] . In CO
2
reduction process, the continuous production of CO increases the
reducing environment on the feed side, and this can increase the
basicity and induce more carbonate formation on the surface. This
could be the reason for the carbonate formation observed in some
of the Sr- or Ca-based membranes in Table 6 , even though they are
predicted to be carbonate-free by the Ellingham diagram in Fig. 8 .
Recent advancements in situ and operando material character-
ization  methods  can  be  applied  to  examine  membrane  stability
during  CO
2  reduction.  For  example,  using  in  situ  Raman  spec-
troscopy,  Cheng  and  Liu  [135]  observed  sulfur  poisoning  of  Ni-
YSZ anodes for solid-oxide fuel cells while cooling from ∼500 to
800 °C to room temperature, which could not be revealed by ex
situ Raman experiments. Hardy et al. [136] examined the compo-
sition change of an LSCoF-6428 cathode of a solid-oxide fuel cell
using in situ XRD, and observed gradual expansion of the lattice
structure during operation, which was correlated with Sr and Co
losses. So far, there are not any reports on using these in situ and
operando methods to characterize the stability of membranes un-
der CO
2  reduction. Interested readers can find more information
on these characterization methods in [137–139] .

Even though carbonate formation can decrease the membrane
2  adsorption or carbonate formation can be the first
stability, CO
step of the CO
2  reduction on the oxygen permeable membranes.
More about the reduction mechanisms will be discussed later in
this review.

4. Chemical kinetics and flux models

As  shown  in  Fig.  2 (b),  there  are  generally  five  steps  in  a

4.1. Bulk diffusion

4.1.1. Charged species

For an unpolarized membrane, the material should exhibit ionic
and  electronic  conductivities,  i.e.,  mixed  conductivity.  Charged
species, e.g., lattice oxygen, electrons and/or holes diffuse across
the membrane, driven by the chemical potential gradient as shown
in Fig. 2 (b). For a single-phase membrane, there is often one dom-
inant  electronic  charged  species,  either  electrons  or  holes,  and
the  membrane  is  either  an  n -type  or  p -type  conductor  [76,140] .
However, as it experiences a large oxygen partial pressure differ-
ence,  e.g.,  fuel  sweep  that  leads  to  low  partial  pressure  on  the
sweep side, there may be a transition of the dominant electronic
charged species across the membrane [141] . In order to estimate
the  bulk  distribution  of  the  charged  species  concentrations,  de-
fect reactions mechanisms are required. Here we use the Ca-doped
LaFeO
3 −δ as  an  example  to  illustrate  the  variation  in  charged
species concentration under different oxygen partial pressures. The
non-stoichiometric defect reactions for Ca-doped LaFeO

3 −δ are

actions if any of the steps involve charge transfer.

4.2. Surface reaction kinetics

Although  many  studies  have  been  conducted  for  membrane-
2 reduction, surface reaction mechanisms and kinet-
supported CO
ics are yet to be fully characterized. In addition, the CO
2 reduction
mechanisms for the two thermochemical reduction methods (i.e.,
chemical looping and membrane supported reduction) are similar,
as both involve the gas-solid heterogeneous reaction between the
CO

2 and the oxide.
Oxygen-containing molecules such as H

2 were found
to react with the oxygen vacancies, similar to the interaction be-
tween  oxygen  gas  and  vacancies  [85,153,154] .  Several  multi-step

steps are for the interactions between the membrane surface and
CO
2  reacts with the membrane to
form a thin layer of carbonate and (ii) the carbonate decomposes
with electron transfer and oxygen incorporate to form CO:

Either monodentate or bidentate carbonates can form on an ox-
2 adsorbs on a surface lat-
ide surface. The former occurs when CO
tice oxygen [157] , while the later takes place between CO
2 and a
pair of surface sites, i.e., a lattice oxygen and an oxygen vacancy
[158] .  If  the  carbonate  decomposes,  as  in  reaction  (31) ,  CO  will
be produced. This is observed on LaFeO
3  surface using TPD; and
the more reduced the surface is, the more CO desorption is ob-
served [158] . However, if the carbonates do not decompose, they
may cover the surface and stop further reactions. This is related to
membrane instability discussed earlier.

A similar reaction mechanism involving carbonate formation as
a sub-step is hypothesized by Voigt et al. [159] based on the ex-
perimental results on a sputtered Fe-doped SrTiO
3  single crystal
surface:

(37)

These two reactions are related with charge transfer and occurs
once a current is introduced in the electrolysis cell. The rates are
written in Arrhenius form [160,161] . Experiments showed that the
carbon deposition reaction in an electrolysis cell is significantly fa-
cilitated with the value of the overpotential, and hence, the cell
should operate at lower overpotential to decrease carbon deposi-
tion on the triple phase boundary between Ni and YSZ [161] .

4.3. Kinetics model

Based on the bulk diffusion and surface reaction kinetics mod-
els described above, expressions have been developed to express
the dependency of the permeation process for oxygen separation,
2  reduction on the operating conditions. A
water splitting and CO
recent review covers most of the oxygen permeation models for
MIEC oxygen permeable membranes [162] where the derivation of
these models can be found. In this review, we focus on how to
apply these models to describe the CO
2 reduction process. We first
describe the mass diffusion in the gas phase and in the solid phase.
Then a simplified model for bulk-limiting and a generalized model
considering both bulk diffusion and surface reactions are discussed
for CO

2 reduction.

In the gas phase diffusion steps, the flux without gas phase re-

j , [mol m −2 s −1 ], is modeled as,
actions, J
(cid:4)
(cid:3)
J i
b, j − C i
C i
j = h i
(38)
s, j
m, j
where h m  is mass transfer coefficient, [m s −1 ], C is the concen-
tration, [mol m −3 ]. The superscript i is either feed or sweep side.
Subscripts b and s represent the gas bulk and surface properties,
respectively.  The  mass  transfer  coefficient  in  the  gas  phase  can
be calculated from Sherwood number correlations [163] and the
species diffusion coefficients [164] . In cases where the gas phase
reactions cannot be neglected, such as methane sweep cases, the
concentration  difference  between  the  gas  near  and  away  from
the  membrane  surface  can  be  more  significant;  the  gas  phase
reactive-diffusion should be considered. In experiments, a capillary
probe can be inserted into the reactor to sample the gas species
in  vicinity  of  the  surface  [59,71,117–119] ,  as  described  earlier  in
Section 3.2.3 .

The diffusion of charged species in the solid phase can be de-

scribed by the Nernst–Planck equation [165] ,

and the subscript i denotes the charged species i .

which describes the flux in one-dimensional. When the membrane
is thick and bulk diffusion is the rate-limiting step, Eq. (43) alone
can be used to approximate the oxygen permeation. Hence, a crit-
ical  thickness,  t c ,  is  defined  to  identify  whether  the  flux  across
the  membrane  is  surface  or  transport-limited.  In  the  following,
we first describe the oxygen permeation model in the latter case,
with either electrons or electron holes as the dominating electronic
charged  species.  Next,  a  more  general  oxygen  flux  model  is  de-
rived, considering both bulk diffusion and surface reaction kinetics.
In  order  to  select  the  correct  model  for  oxygen  permeation,
experiments are performed to parametrize the kinetics of surface
reactions  and  bulk  diffusion  and  compare  their  significance.  Wu
and  Ghoniem  [58]  carried  out  a  detailed  reaction  kinetics  study
2 reduction and compared
on the LCaF-91 membrane supported CO
the  resistances  of  the  surface  reactions  and  bulk  diffusion.  They
found  that  a  1.3-mm  thick  LCaF-91  membrane,  the  rate-limiting
step transitions from the feed side CO
2  reduction kinetics to the
sweep side fuel oxidation reaction kinetics at higher temperatures,
as shown in Fig. 16 .

4.3.1. Bulk-diffusion limited

When oxygen permeation is bulk-diffusion limited, we can as-
sume quasi-equilibrium reactions on the surface. In the case that
the  membrane conducts  only  electrons and oxygen  ions (similar
results can be derived for electron hole conductors), the ionic flux
in the case of air-feed-inert-sweep becomes: [166]

ductivity can be described as constant (  ̄σ

4.3.2. Generalized transport model

For the cases when the surface reaction rates should be con-
sidered,  Xu  and  Thomson  [140]  developed  a  generalized  oxy-
gen transport model for air separation considering two gas/solid
reactions  on  both  surfaces  and  one  oxygen  ion  bulk  diffusion,
based  on  the  theoretical  model  from  Lin  et  al.  [167] .  Later,  Wu
and Ghoniem extended this model to other oxygen sources such
as  H
2  [58,71] .  Here,  we  will  summarize  the
2 reduction. For other cases of membrane supported
case with CO
air  separation  and  water  splitting,  more  detail  can  be  found  in
[59,140,162,168] .

One-step reaction is used to describe the surface reactions. On

the feed side,

On the sweep side, depending on the sweeping condition, the
oxygen evolution or Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism are used
for inert sweep or methane sweep, respectively:

(49)

(50)

(51)

Several  assumptions  are  made  to  simplify  the  permeation

model:

(1) The backwards reactions are neglected due to the low oxygen
flux compared to the total flow rate and hence the low product
concentrations compared to the reactants;

(2) Electron hole concentration across the membrane is assumed
to be constant as the electronic transference number is much
higher than ionic transference number [169,170] . Therefore, the
vacancy flux is viewed as zero-order in electron hole concen-
trations [140,171] .

(3) The total site concentration for oxygen species C o is

C O = C

O X
O

+ C V

(52)

where C
and C V are the concentrations of lattice oxygen and oxy-
O X
O
gen vacancies, respectively, [mol m −3 ]. C o is assumed to be a con-
stant value (for example, the value is 0.0825 mol cm −3 , estimated
from the XRD measurements of the stoichiometric LCaF-91 lattice
size in air [172] ).

Based on these assumptions, the vacancy fluxes are:
Feed side:

J(cid:7) V = k

f,C O 2 C(cid:7) C O 2 C(cid:7) V

Sweep side:

insert : J (cid:7)(cid:7) V =  ̃ k r, O 2 ( C O − C (cid:7)(cid:7) V ) − k

here, J (cid:7)

on the feed and sweep side surfaces, respectively, [mol m −2 s −1 ];
C (cid:7)

sweep side, respectively, [mol m −3 ];  ̃ k is the new reaction constant
after lumping the electron hole concentration.

i and C (cid:7) (cid:7)

For the oxygen vacancy diffusion flux as in (43) , when the ionic
conductivity is the limiting step for the bulk diffusion, we obtain
the oxygen vacancy diffusion rate in the bulk:

J V = −D V

(56)

By equating the oxygen vacancy flux on the feed side surface,
(53) , through the bulk (56) , and on the sweep side surface, (54) or
(55) , the flux equation is expressed in the form of the potential
difference over the sum of three resistances as [140,167]

membrane. Feed and sweep sides are at high and low potential, μ’ and μ’’ , re-
spectively (Modified from [168] with permission of the PCCP Owner Societies).

the local oxygen flux can be calculated with respect to the log-
mean membrane area, dA m = 2 π r m dl or to the inner surface of the
membrane. In the first case, the log-mean radius is used to calcu-
late the log-mean membrane area,
r m = ( r o − r i ) / ln ( r o − r i )

(58)

i and r o are the inner and outer radius of the tubular mem-
where r
brane, [m] [173] . For the latter case, the resistance equations with
respect to the inner surface area is summarized in Table 7 for the
oxygen flux per unit length of a tubular membrane.

More  elaborate  models  have  been  developed  to  incorporate
multi-step  surface  reaction  mechanisms  and  different  charged

higher  fidelity  models  are  useful  when  modeling  membranes
subject  to  a  large  oxygen  partial  pressure  difference,  in  which
both electronic and ionic conductivity could be on the same or-
der of magnitude and kinetics mechanism must consider all the
charged  species,  e.g.,  electrons,  holes  or  polarons.  For  example,

of molar concentrations of both mobile and fixed charged species
in the lattice of the membrane, [C m −3 ]. The PNP model can de-
scribe  the  oxygen  permeation  in  a  mixed  conducting  membrane
with multiple charged species [60,141] . When the charged species
in  a  mixed  conductor  changes  over  the  oxygen  partial  pressure
(shown in Fig. 12 ), this model can describe the process accurately.
This should be even more critical in the case of mixed phase ma-
terials where the electronic and ionic conductivity are on similar
order of magnitude. Incorporating detailed CO
2 reduction mecha-
nisms into these higher-fidelity transport models has not been at-
tempted yet.

5. CO 2 -to-fuel systems

As discussed earlier in this review, this membrane process can
convert  CO
2  into  CO  using  thermal  energy  and  chemical  poten-
tial gradients. A promising application is solar-fuel production in
which concentrated solar energy is integrated with a membrane
reactor supporting CO
2  reduction. The full spectrum solar irradi-
ance can be utilized as the thermal energy input. Kogan [36] de-
signed a porous zirconia membrane reactor integrated with a solar
receiver for water splitting, while similar reactor layout is applica-
ble for CO
2 reduction. This system is based on two concentrators
(as shown in Fig. 18 ) to achieve a radiation concentration of the
order of 10,0 0 0 and a reactor wall temperature reaching 2250 K.
Other components were made of ZrO
2 and MgO to maintain me-
chanical and thermal stability at elevated temperatures (the melt-
ing points of ZrO

2 and MgO are 2715 and 2800 °C, respectively).

Three  ways  to  integrate  concentrated  solar  irradiance  with  a
membrane reactor are shown in Fig. 19 . The first shows solar irra-
diance directly shining onto the membrane surface, which requires
a transparent but also gas tight enclosure [65,174] . In the second,
solar irradiance is adsorbed by the entrance wall, making the re-
actor shorter to maintain high operating temperatures along the
membrane surfaces [175] . The third option shows separation be-
tween the heating system and the membrane reactor, where the
solar heat is absorbed by a heat exchanger to heat up the input
gases. In this option, existing solar thermal heating systems can be
used and the membrane reactor can be optimized separately. Ad-
ditionally, electricity from photovoltaics (PVs) or other sources can
also be used to generate the elevated operating temperatures by
direct resistive heating, similar to the case in a solid oxide electrol-

ysis cells where heat is supplied by internal Joule heating and/or
additional resistive heating [176] .

On  the  other  hand,  as  mentioned  in  Table  3 ,  the  two  sides
of the membrane can operate at different pressures to maximize
the chemical potential gradients or to integrate with downstream
processes.  Pressurized  feed  side  [177,178]  or  vacuum sweep side
[179] can enhance oxygen permeation rates. A large scale mem-
brane system with pressurized feed side for over 16 tons/day of
oxygen  production  was  demonstrated  by  Air  Products  and  Cera-
matec, and robust support layers were added on the thin mem-
brane layer to withstand the high pressure difference [180] . Fraun-
hofer Institute for Ceramic Technologies and Systems built a pilot
plant for pure oxygen production with vacuum sweep; the oxygen
production is 10 m 3 (STP) O
2 /h (0.34 tons/day), and the energy de-
mand is 0.72 kWh/m 3  (STP) O
2  [181] . Another process developed
by  Praxair  used  high  pressure  fuel  sweep  to  integrate  with  coal
and natural gas power cycles with CCS [182] . Similar membrane

systems can be used for CO

In order to evaluate these different operation options, paramet-
ric studies should be conducted to investigate the rate dependence
2  concentra-
on the operating conditions (e.g., the flow rates,  CO
tion and sweep side condition), and the membrane characteristics

sweep,  while  the  vacuum  pump-sweep  nonreactive  process  had
an efficiency lower than 20% [183] .

A  similar  analysis  comparing  different  sweep  conditions  for
membrane-supported CO

[174] , where they compared a tubular ceria membrane at 1800 K

by integrating the membrane reactor for CO

2 reduction.

In the efficiency studies reviewed above, the pressure drop in
the  membrane  reactor  was  neglected.  However,  as  indicated  in

[184,185] , the pressure drop could be a significant energy penalty
in a membrane reactor depending on the membrane design, and
should be considered when evaluating the system efficiency. For
example, when the total volume of the membrane reactor is fixed,
larger surface-to-volume ratios can lead to higher production but
larger pressure drops than smaller ratios [186] . The membrane de-
sign (e.g., channel size and length, and the frontal area), the chan-
nel numbers, the total reactor volume, the averaged oxygen fluxes,
and  the  pressure  drop  are  all  integrated.  Hence,  higher-fidelity
models of the membrane supported CO
2 reduction system, includ-
ing sensitivity analysis, are required to correlate the membrane de-
sign,  area  requirement,  pressure  drop  in  the  reactor  and  system
optimization. In addition, techno-economic analysis of CO
2 reduc-
tion and fuel production, as well as life-cycle assessments should
be also performed to facilitate the commercialization of this tech-
nology.

6. Challenges and future prospect

Membrane supported CO

2 reduction is a promising technology
that can be integrated into different renewable energy sources to
reuse the captured CO
2 . Based on this review, several challenges
have been identified, from the mechanistic understanding of the
process  to  large-scale  demonstration.  Advancements  at  different
scales are needed to facilitate the commercialization of this tech-
nology.

6.1. Materials development

For membrane materials, both physical and chemical properties
are important. The mechanical strength and durability of the mem-
branes under high temperature and possibly total pressure differ-
ence for process integration is a major physical challenge. In or-
der to decrease the oxygen diffusion barrier and the materials cost,
thinner membranes are desired. However, to improve the mechan-
ical strength and overall permeation performance, a porous sup-

port is usually added to the dense membrane. An optimal porous
support should have low mass diffusion barrier, good mixed con-
ductivity, fast reaction kinetics, high chemical stability, and good
thermal compatibility.

For  the  chemical  properties,  new  materials  with  faster  kinet-
ics  and  higher  stability  should  be  developed,  e.g.,  mixed-phase
membrane materials with optimum compositions and catalytic sur-
face  modification.  A  combination  of  the  Ellingham  diagram  and
other  descriptors  such  as  the  basicity  of  the  materials  can  help
in  the  discovery  of  new  materials  with  resistance  for  carbonate
formation.  In  addition,  catalytic  porous  support  and  asymmetric
structures  can  improve  gas-surface  kinetics.  To  accelerate  mate-
rial development, it is important to determine kinetic parameters,
e.g., conductivity and reaction rate constants from high through-
put  experimental  measurements  supported  by  transport  models.
Automation can be applied to the experimental setups to increase
the efficiency and repeatability in data acquisition. Local gas atmo-
sphere near the membrane surface should be investigated to reveal
the material properties. Advanced in situ material characterization
methods,  e.g.,  Raman  and  X-ray  adsorption  spectroscopy,  should
be applied to examine the interaction between the solid materials
and the gas species, and therefore reveal the reaction mechanisms,
similar to those used in the study of solid oxide electrochemical
cells [138] . Additionally, computational material modeling such as
density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) have
been used for similar but different processes [187,188] . Efforts are
also needed to screen the thermodynamics properties of various
oxide  membrane  materials  such  as  perovskites,  fluorites,  spinels
2  reduction.  Stable
and  Ruddlesden-Popper  phases  to  support  CO
materials for simultaneous water splitting and CO
2 reduction can
reduce the cost and complexity of fuel production.

Furthermore,  the  costs  of  all  the  components,  i.e.,  the  mem-
branes,  supports  and  catalysts  are  important  parameters  for  the
deployment of such membrane reactor. Hence, materials develop-
ment should focus on using non-critical earth-abundant materials
or decreasing the amounts of material uses in the reactor.

26

6.2. Reactor design and manufacturing

Physical or numerical models, incorporating fluid mechanics, re-
action  kinetics,  heat  and  mass  diffusion,  can  support  the  design
of new reactor configurations. More studies should be carried out
with both experiments and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to
determine the dependence of the species concentrations, temper-
2 conversion rates on different reactor de-
ature gradients, and CO
signs, such as tubular, planar and monolith reactors, and co-current
flow, countercurrent flow and cross-flow configurations. With more
datasets available on the reactor performance and its dependence
on  geometries,  operating  conditions  and  integration  approaches,
artificial intelligence and machine learning tools are also useful in
this endeavor.

The development of advanced manufacture techniques, such as
3D  printing  of  functional  ceramic  materials,  high  precision  ma-
chining  and  automation  show  new  paths  for  membrane  fabrica-
tion (both dense and porous parts) with the optimized geometries
predicted by the physical or numerical models. Hence, better per-
formances, such as lower gas phase diffusion barrier and higher
CO
2 conversion rates, can be achieved compared to the membranes
fabricated with traditional methods such as press-and-sinter and
extrusion. Additionally, sustainable and green manufacturing tech-
niques are also desired to decrease the waste and carbon footprint
in the entire life-cycle of the reactors. Recycle or dispose of the
end-of-life reactors should be also studied to improve the sustain-
ability.

6.3. Novel process integration and system analysis

Various processes can be integrated into a membrane reactor
2  reduction, apart from the oxygen production and
to support CO
syngas production (see Fig. 2 (a) and Table 5 ). Oxidation reactions
that can use the oxygen stream on the sweep side will enhance
the CO
2 reduction by increasing the oxygen chemical potential gra-
dient across the membrane. Examples are methane oxidative cou-
pling to ethylene, ethane and propane oxidative dehydrogenation,
ethylene epoxidation to ethylene oxide, and biomass or coal gasi-
fication. Regardless of the scenario of carbon emission policies, in-
tegration  of  an  important  industrial  process  into  the  membrane
2  reuse technology more favorable eco-
reactor can make this CO
nomically for large scale applications. Another integration option
is having the CO
2 capture process integrated onto the feed side to
achieve capture and utilization in one-unit reactor. Demonstration
of these novel processes can show the versatility of this membrane
2 cap-
process and could potentially improve the economics of CO
ture and utilization.
2 O and CO

2 co-reduction on the feed side of the reactor is also
promising [189] . Syngas is produced from the co-reduction, which
can be further processed into hydrocarbon fuels. When renewable
energy is used as the heat source, this co-reduction process can be
viewed as a sustainable way to recycle the combustion products
(H
2 ) to close the carbon loop. In this process, the com-
petition between the water gas shift reaction and the reduction re-
actions on either the solid surface or in the gas phase can make
the reaction mechanisms more complicated. Yet these competing
pathways are similar to those in the H
2 co-electrolysis
in solid oxide electrolysis cells [190,191] . Much can be learned from
these two emerging applications.

2 O and CO

2 O and CO

H

Furthermore,  system-level  simulation  and  techno-economic
analysis are required to identify the optimal combination of mem-
brane  compositions  and  operating  conditions  for  efficiency  im-
provement and cost reduction. So far, the membrane performance
has been mainly determined on the basis of CO production rate.
Yet  performance  criteria,  under  which  this  membrane-supported
2  reduction  technology  can  be  profitable  and  widely  adopted
CO

should  be  developed  based  on  techno-economic  analysis.  More-
over, life-cycle assessment should be conducted to investigate the
carbon footprint and energy storage potential of the system and
their dependence on the CO
2 reduction rates and material stabil-
ity. These can benefit from the knowledge on materials, kinetics
and reactor designs. In turn, these macro-scale analyses can give
guidance for materials development and reactor optimization with
the considerations of cost and performance.

6.4. Large-scale demonstration

More demonstrations at the laboratory scale and pilot scale are
needed to understand the system performance, such as uniformity
of the fabricated membranes, the distribution of the catalysts and
the temperature profile in the reactor. Eventually, it is important
to construct pilot and industrial scale demonstrations of this mem-
brane supported CO
2 reduction technology to translate the knowl-
edge into practice and also gain experience and knowledge related
to large-scale operations.

One promising demonstration example is to combine concen-
trated solar power with the membrane reactor for solar-fuels pro-
ductions.  Depending  on  the  operating  conditions,  three  different
integration approaches can be adapted (shown in Fig. 19 ). The tem-
perature profile in the reactor, the CO
2 conversion ratio, the pres-
sure drop inside the reactor, and the overall solar-to-fuel conver-
sion efficiency are the important parameters to be measured.

The  stability  of  membrane  materials  and  catalysts  under  the
non-ideal operating conditions, such as temperature and pressure
gradients, are the challenges in large-scale demonstrations. In ad-
dition, if the system is located in the downstream of the exhausts
from fossil fuel power plants, the material corrosions by H
2 S and
2 can become a problem [192,193] . Studies should be carried out
SO
to understand the impacts of a mixture of H
2 O
on the stability and performance of such membrane reactors.

In addition, when using an intermittent heat source, such as so-
lar heat, it is necessary to understand the system response to dy-
namics. Due to the constraints on the thermal expansion of the ce-
ramic materials in the membrane reactor, the reactor might need
to  be  kept  at  high  temperatures  even  when  the  solar  energy  is
not available. Therefore, more flexible systems that can withstand
high ramp rates in temperatures or can incorporate different heat
sources when renewable heat is unavailable should be developed.

and the pore sizes, etc.; operating conditions such as temperature,
pressure, and flow rates; and performances including CO produc-
tion rates (in μmol cm −2 s −1 instead of mL cm −2 min −1 to reduce
confusion regarding the conditions) and CO
2 conversion ratio. Ad-
ditionally, only gas species concentrations closed to the membrane
surface should be used to derive the kinetics parameters for sur-
face reactions (measured directly using a capillary probe [119] or
calculated  from  mass  diffusion  correlations).  Furthermore,  when
using  commonly  used  button-cell  reactors,  attentions  should  be
given to the concentration distributions along the radial direction
of the membrane [62] , and the effect of the flow rate and reactor
geometry should be carefully considered. Finally, the energy effi-
ciency of the process should be reported. A recommended form of
efficiency is based on primary energy, for instance
