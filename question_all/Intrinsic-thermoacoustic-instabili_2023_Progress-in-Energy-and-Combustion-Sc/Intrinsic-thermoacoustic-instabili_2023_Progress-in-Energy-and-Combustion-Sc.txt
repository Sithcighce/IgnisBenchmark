Intrinsic thermoacoustic feedback loop
Combustion instability

It is accepted that the thermoacoustic behavior of a given combustion system can be analyzed by investigating
how its natural acoustic modes are perturbed by the flame dynamics. As a result, the resonance frequency
and structure of the resulting thermoacoustic mode – understood as a perturbed acoustic mode – are slightly
modified with respect to the natural acoustic mode counterpart. However, experimental evidence shows that
the frequency of unstable thermoacoustic modes sometimes lies far away from the natural acoustic frequencies
of the system under study. In many cases, this frequency cannot be associated with hydrodynamic or entropy-
related instabilities. In recent years, the intrinsic thermoacoustic (ITA) feedback loop has been formally
recognized as the responsible mechanism in some of those situations. Theory and devoted experiments have
been developed that have enormously contributed to the understanding of the particular behavior of intrinsic
thermoacoustic instabilities.

The present review encapsulates in a single theoretical framework the theory presented in the collection
of today existing ITA papers, which spread through different cases of study regarding acoustic boundaries –
anechoic, partially or fully reflecting – and geometries – duct flames, combustors composed by three coaxial
ducts and annular configurations. Several examples are shown that summarize the most relevant results on
ITA theory to this day. This review paper also gives special attention to the categorization of ITA modes, given
the fact that there is no current agreement on the definition of an ITA mode: one example in this review paper
explicitly shows that the proposed categorization methods can indeed be contradictory. Of high interest is also
the review of papers illustrating the coexistence of thermoacoustic modes of acoustic and ITA nature, which
in turn relate to the recently discovered exceptional points in the thermoacoustic spectrum. Additionally, this
paper discusses the ‘counter-intuitive’ evidence that shows that ITA modes can be destabilized when acoustic
dissipative elements are added into the system. Finally, it is shown how a single-mode Galerkin expansion may
be able to model some ITA eigenfrequencies. This result is suggested in some recent works and is not obvious.
The practical relevance of ITA modes in industrial combustion chambers of gas turbines is also discussed
together with suggestions for future studies.

1. Introduction

Thermoacoustic instability is a recurrent problem during testing and
operation of gas turbines. In recent decades, with the advent of lean
combustion technologies, the probability of occurrence of this type of
instability has increased, as lean premixed flames are very sensitive
to the surrounding acoustic environment [1]. Until recently, thermoa-
coustic modes1 were understood to be exclusively associated with the
acoustic cavity modes of the combustion system. Acoustic cavity modes
may be understood as modes directly linked to the geometrical enclo-
sure characterizing the entire thermoacoustic system. The existence of
other types of thermoacoustic modes, not linked with acoustic cavity
modes, was not formally recognized until the seminal works of Emmert

et al. [2], Bomberg et al. [3] and Hoeijmakers et al. [4]. In the following
we refer to the acoustic cavity modes of a given thermoacoustic system,
which can be also understood as passive thermoacoustic modes [5],
simply as acoustic modes.2

1.1. The classical paradigm: Thermoacoustic modes are perturbed acoustic
modes

Based on a large amount of observations and scientific experience,
Culick [6] states: ‘‘Probably the most important fundamental charac-
teristic of combustion instabilities is that in first approximation they
may be viewed as perturbations of classical acoustical motions". This

1 In this review paper, the term ‘thermoacoustic mode’ is reserved to modes exclusively associated with the coupling between the heat release rate produced

by the flame and the acoustic field. Other modes, such as hydrodynamic or entropy-acoustic related modes are not considered within this term.

2 This definition includes the effect of mean heat release rate, i.e. increase of mean temperature across the flame, on the acoustic field.

proposition has a corollary, as stated by Lieuwen [7]:
‘‘[Thermo-]
Acoustic oscillations in combustors are manifested as narrow band
oscillations near the natural acoustic frequencies of the system’’. In an
extensive survey, Ghirardo et al. [8] show that this is indeed the case
most of the time (see Table 1. of said study).

Calculation techniques have been developed to investigate thermoa-
coustic instabilities. Two techniques are prevalent. (i) The Helmholtz
equation or the formulation of an acoustic network model may result

in a nonlinear eigenvalue problem. It is usually assumed, following the
classical paradigm, that an appropriate initial guess for the iterative
solver is a pre-evaluated natural acoustic frequency of the system [5,9].
(ii) The Galerkin expansion method (see Culick [6] for an overview),
where a given thermoacoustic mode is expressed as a linear com-
bination of few acoustic modes of the system. If only one mode is
of relevance, i.e. if a thermoacoustic mode is considered as a scaled
acoustic mode, it is possible to derive a simple algebraic relation that
describes a given thermoacoustic eigenfrequency as a perturbed natural
acoustic frequency, where the perturbation term contains the effect of
the flame dynamics. The two aforementioned approaches allow for a
physical insight into the problem, while reinforcing the proposition of
thermoacoustic modes being, in first approximation, perturbed acoustic
modes.

1.2. Observations without unified explanation

During the past two decades several investigations were performed,
where thermoacoustic oscillations could not be explained under the
classical paradigm. In the following, we discuss four experimental
studies that are well documented. It is highly likely that the literature
includes many other observations that do not properly fit under the
‘lens’ of the classical paradigm. Some of those studies are discussed in
Section 10 of this paper.

Eckstein et al. [10] investigated a particular thermoacoustic insta-
bility present in a spray swirled combustor, where a swirl airblast
atomizer – with a design typical of aero-engine systems – is mounted
in a generic combustion chamber. A combustion instability is reported
at a resonance frequency close to 120 Hz. Since this (low) frequency
is far away from any of the natural acoustic frequencies of the system
under investigation, it was first thought that an entropy-acoustic wave
coupling was occurring. In order to support that hypothesis, the venturi
nozzle at the combustor outlet was removed in order to eliminate the
generation of acoustic waves at this location due to incoming entropy
waves. Interestingly, the authors report that the instability does not
disappear: the amplitude of oscillation actually increases! They explain
that there may exist a feedback loop between the generation by the
flame of acoustic waves and the spray dynamics at the injector. The
authors conclude that: ‘‘the injector and especially the convective delay
times in the primary zone are the main sources for self-excitation". This
idea is further elaborated with a devoted network model by Eckstein
and Sattelmayer [11].

Weyermann [12] conducted experiments on combustion noise gen-
erated by a confined, swirled, premixed flame. A strong peak in the
sound pressure level is measured at around 100 Hz, which is far from
a natural resonance mode of the system. A model is first used, where
the source of combustion noise is assumed to be insensitive to external
acoustic fluctuations. The model recovers a cusp at around 400 Hz
(associated with an acoustic mode of the system) but not the peak at
100 Hz. The authors then suggest that this peak may be caused by a
feedback loop between the unsteady heat release rate and upstream
fluctuations in the flow. As a result, they consider a devoted convective
model with an adjusted time-delay between the velocity at a reference
position and the flame. They are finally able to recover the peak at
100 Hz, as shown in experiments.

Tay-Wo-Chong et al. [13] carried out a Large Eddy Simulation
(LES) of a swirled premixed combustor similar to the one investigated
by Weyermann [12]. After evaluating the flame transfer function,
the authors use an acoustic network model for stability analysis and
estimate the eigenfrequencies of the system. The authors find three
eigenfrequencies of interest in the low frequency band (< 500 Hz).
Two of them are recognized to be associated with two acoustic modes:
a Helmholtz mode of the plenum and the quarter-wave mode of the
combustion chamber. The remaining one (mode b in that study) does
not have any acoustic mode to be associated with. Hence, the authors
directly relate this mode with the flame dynamics without any real

clarification or justification. The study also mentions that experiments
demonstrate strong pressure oscillations at a very similar frequency of
mode b.

Hoeijmakers [14,15] carried out experiments on a collection of
laminar Bunsen-type flames stabilized at a perforated plate, and con-
fined within an elongated duct, where the upstream termination is
designed to exhibit very low acoustic reflection. This is achieved by
designing a devoted acoustic horn. Enforcing a low acoustic reflection
at the downstream end by the same means proved difficult [16]. The
experimental results of Hoeijmakers [14,15], formally shown years
later by Hoeijmakers et al. [17], attracted the attention of the ther-
moacoustic community. Based on careful experiments and a simple
theoretical analysis, Hoeijmakers [15] suggests that strong thermoa-
coustic instabilities may occur even in the limit of anechoic boundary
conditions!

1.3. Towards the complete picture

Bomberg et al. [3] and Emmert et al. [2] formally recognize the
existence of an Intrinsic ThermoAcoustic (ITA) feedback loop between
the flame and the upstream flow. They formulate a causal network
representation of the flame element in terms of incoming acoustic
waves (fu and gd) and the associated response, i.e. outgoing acoustic
waves (fd and gu). Note that the acoustic waves, also mathematically
recognized as Riemann invariants, are related to the primitive variables
(acoustic pressure and velocity), as explained later in Section 2.1.
Bomberg et al. [3] develops a graphical representation of the ITA
circuit. A simplified version of such a diagram is shown in Fig. 1.
The actual diagram together with the associated mathematical model
is explained in Section 2. The array of arrows that result from that
model elucidates two feedback loops. On the one hand, an external
circuit (blue arrows) is apparent. It represents the acoustic feedback
loop associated with the acoustic modes of the system. This loop may be
perturbed and destabilized by the presence of the flame. The existence
of such a perturbed acoustic loop is in agreement with the classical
paradigm. On the other hand, an inner circuit (orange arrows) is visible.
It represents the ITA feedback loop, which can be described in simple
terms. A fluctuation of velocity at a reference position upstream of the
flame generates fluctuations of heat release rate. Subsequently, fluctu-
ations of heat release rate produce downstream and upstream traveling
acoustic waves. An instant after, the upstream traveling acoustic waves
gu modulate the velocity at the reference position, thereby closing the
loop.

The experiments of Hoeijmakers [15] demonstrate that the flame
element can be intrinsically unstable: a localized thermoacoustic feed-
back loop can be strong enough to produce thermoacoustic instabilities
even in the absence of acoustically reflecting boundaries. The diagram
of Fig. 1 explains that observation. In the case of anechoic boundary
conditions the upstream and downstream acoustic reflections are zero,

which leads to the absence of incoming acoustic waves (fu = gd = 0). In
that scenario, the acoustic feedback loop (external blue circuit) ceases
to exist. In contrast, the ITA feedback loop (inner orange circuit) not
only exists, but may also be unstable.

Note that ITA instabilities are not related with thermo-diffusive or
hydrodynamic instabilities: the latter two emerge in the close vicinity
of the flame sheet, strongly depend on local features of the flow and
flame (flame curvature, temperature distribution, etc.) and do not need
acoustic waves to exist. That is the reason why standalone numerical
tools based on the incompressible, reacting Navier–Stokes equations are
unable to capture ITA instabilities. On the other hand, such kind of
instabilities have been observed using compressible solvers, as shown
in the works of Courtine et al. [18] and Silva et al. [19], which are
discussed in Section 3.

The studies of Emmert et al. [2], Bomberg et al. [3] and Hoeijmakers
et al. [4] bring a new insight in thermoacoustics towards a complete
picture. Follow-up questions from these works naturally emerge:

(1) Are perturbed acoustic modes (recall classical paradigm) con-
nected to ITA modes in the limit of zero acoustic reflection?
(2) Can ITA modes be well defined for general acoustic states be-

yond anechoic environments?

(3) Can ITA modes coexist with perturbed acoustic modes in systems

with partially/fully acoustically reflecting boundaries?

(4) Do ITA modes exhibit special properties with respect to the
acoustic counterparts? Do these properties entail new challenges
for thermoacoustic control?

During the past years a numerous amount of studies have been
carried out that have contributed to answering these questions. Fur-
thermore, paradoxical observations have been made, where it has been
shown that ITA modes may require special techniques for stabilization,
as they may not respond to acoustic losses in the same way that a
typical acoustic mode does.

Objectives of the present review article

The understanding of ITA instability is crucial for the design and
control of combustion systems. In only five years, not only the literature
concerning ITA instability has grown substantially but also the number
of concepts and ideas that may sometimes be contradictory. It is there-
fore important to put these studies into perspective and address them in
one context defined by similar questions and case studies. Three main
goals of this paper are:

1. To make clear that standard criteria to classify a given ther-
moacoustic mode as ‘ITA’ do not exist to this day. Different
conceptual ideas have been proposed for such a categorization.
Some of them may be more beneficial than others in describing
what the essence of an ITA mode is.

2. To show that traditional thermoacoustic calculation tools –
namely acoustic network models, Helmholtz solvers and
Galerkin expansion approaches – are capable of modeling ITA
modes.

3. To generalize ITA concepts and equations based on the classi-
cal Rijke tube to the three-duct axial configuration, which is
omnipresent in combustion research.

The next section ‘Mathematical Tools’ exposes the thermoacoustic
models used in the present paper. The Linearized Euler Equations (LEE)
for a quasi-1D system at zero Mach number are the foundation of the
models under investigation. On the one hand, the jump conditions of
compact elements are derived, which together with 1D ducts conform
the ensemble that define the acoustic network model of interest. The
causal representation of inputs and outputs is also considered, as done
by Bomberg et al. [3], which results in the modeling of the acoustic
scattering matrix of the flame element and the diagram that depicts

the ITA and acoustic feedback loops. The section ‘The ITA loop in an
anechoic environment’ is the entry point to the ITA feedback loop.
First, the case of a flame within two ducts, which can be further
simplified to a Rijke tube, is studied as this provides the case of an
isolated ITA circuit, where its frequency and growth rate σ can be
easily computed, as done in previous studies [2–4]. The second part of
this section focuses on the three-duct configuration, where two limiting
cases (σ → −∞ and σ = 0; see Section 2.2) are of special interest. The
subsequent section is called ‘The ITA loop in an environment with ideal
boundary conditions’. This section is of notable interest because: (i) ITA
modes are no longer isolated: an interplay of acoustic and ITA modes
emerges; (ii) fully reflecting boundary conditions offer simplicity in the
analysis of both limiting cases (σ → −∞ and σ = 0; see Section 2.2).
In particular, the scenario characterizing the neutral stable case (zero
growth rate σ = 0) is of utmost importance as it depicts the conditions
of the stability–instability borderline. This section focuses on the case
‘three-duct configuration’. Simpler cases, such as the one of the Rijke
tube, can be derived as particular cases from the general formulations
presented. The section ‘Categorization of ITA modes in reflective envi-
ronments’ presents the techniques developed to this day to distinguish
between thermoacoustic modes with a strong acoustic or a strong ITA
nature. This section shows in one example how those criteria may
be contradictory. An additional example explores the possibilities of
analysis if the criterion proposed by Yong et al. [20] is chosen. The
section ‘Parametric maps and exceptional points’ explores the works
carried out on the thermoacoustic spectrum, given a defined window
in the complex plane, where parametric analysis considering two flame
response parameters is performed. This section explores the main fea-
tures of the obtained maps, such as acoustic and ITA trajectories, and
exceptional points. The section ‘Counterintuitive phenomenon: acoustic
damping may destabilize ITA modes’ is of crucial importance as it
reviews the works that have encountered unusual stability behavior
when a thermoacoustic mode is confronted with acoustic damping at
the boundaries. The section ‘ITA modes in annular combustors’ re-
veals, mainly following [21,22], that ITA eigenfrequencies manifest in
annular combustors as groups of clusters. This section discusses the as-
sociated analysis given by the two aforementioned studies. The section
‘The Galerkin Expansion’ reveals that a classical one-mode Galerkin
expansion, together with a suitable flame response model, is able to
capture not only ITA eigenfrequencies in the limit of n → 0 but also
in the entire complex plane around a given acoustic mode. The section
‘Practical Relevance’ encompasses a careful literature review that shows
cases in existing scientific literature that cannot be understood within
the lens of the classical paradigm. Based on the theory reviewed in this
paper, it is shown that a resonance of the ITA-feedback loop may be
the reason for the observations made in those investigations. Finally,
the section ‘Conclusions and perspectives’ highlights the main results
discussed in this review article and postulate future paths for the further
investigation of intrinsic thermoacoustic instability.

2. Mathematical tools

Thermoacoustic instabilities associated with gas turbine combustion
chambers can be modeled via the Linearized Euler Equations (LEE).
In this paper, we focus on acoustic plane waves and associated axial
thermoacoustic modes. Note that plane acoustic waves also play an
important role in annular combustors (see Section 8).

We consider acoustic plane waves propagating in a quasi-1D system
at zero Mach number, as entropy waves are not of interest in this study.

quantities are noted by ̄[] and []′, respectively.

First, we consider Eqs. (1) and (2), when deriving acoustic network
models in Section 2.1. Subsequently, the zero gain limit of those
equations is discussed in Section 2.2. For readers not familiar with
thermoacoustic modeling, Refs. [23] (chapter 8) and the notes of [24]
could be of interest.

2.1. Acoustic network model

A network model can be used to evaluate solutions of the LEE on a
system composed by acoustic elements of different nature. In this study,
Eqs. (1) and (2) are considered to evaluate jump conditions of compact
elements. Such compact elements are subsequently connected via 1D
acoustic ducts, where acoustic wave propagation is well defined.

Compact elements

Eqs. (1) and (2) are integrated along x and the compactness as-
sumption is considered, where ∂∕∂t ∫ u′dx and ∂∕∂t ∫ p′dx are assumed
small with respect to the other resulting terms [25]. Next, harmonic
oscillations []′ = ̂[]est are considered. The Laplace variable is defined as
s = σ+iω, where σ is the growth rate and ω the frequency of oscillation.
The resulting expressions read

̂pd = ̂pu

̂̇Q,

(4)

where ̂̇Q = ∫ ̂̇qadx denotes the volume-integrated heat release rate,
also recognized as the global heat release rate characterizing the flame
element. The scripts []u and []d, as illustrated in Fig. 2, represent
upstream and downstream locations, respectively. Eqs. (3) and (4) are
the jump conditions characterizing an acoustically compact flame and
can be seen as the Rankine–Hugoniot jump conditions in the limit of
zero Mach number [25,26].

The global heat release rate ̂̇Q is usually related to the flow field via
a flame response model  (s), also recognized as flame transfer function
(FTF) in the literature. Premixed flames, which are known to respond
predominantly to acoustic velocity fluctuations [27–29], are usually
modeled by
̂̇Q∕ ̄̇Q
̂uu∕ ̄uu

 (s) =

The mean heat release rate can be expressed as ̄̇Q = ̄ρu ̄uuaucp
̄Tuθ, where
cp, ̄Tu,d and θ = ̄Td∕ ̄Tu − 1 stand for heat capacity at constant pressure,
mean temperature upstream (downstream) of the flame and relative
temperature increment, respectively. Combining this expression with
Eqs. (4) and (5) yields

̂ud = ̂uuα (1 + θ (s)) ,

The thermoacoustic behavior of the system, illustrated in Fig. 2, is

characterized by the 4 × 4 system of equations

algorithms, where an initial guess for s is required. It is common
to use the acoustic eigenfrequencies of the system as initial guesses.
Corresponding results generally deliver eigenfrequencies s that are
close to the initial guesses. Such methodology and results contribute to
the classical paradigm idea, where thermoacoustic eigenpairs are seen
as perturbed acoustic eigenpairs.

2.1.1. Causal representation of the acoustic network model

The definition of the transfer matrices TX in the previous section
is not causal: inputs (elements of the vector multiplying TX ) do not
necessarily occur before the outputs (elements of the vector at the
left-hand side of the corresponding equations). The transfer matrices
TX are mathematical expressions that permit by simple concatenation
of matrices (see expression (13)) the construction of a 4 × 4 matrix
M(s) and derivation of an associated dispersion relation, characterizing
the thermoacoustic stability of the entire system (see Eq. (16)). A
causal representation of inputs with respect to outputs, which facilitates
a posterior analysis of the system, can be provided by an acoustic
scattering representation. As before, this is done by combining Eqs. (3),
(4) and (8). For the flame element, such a representation reads:

element where acoustic reflection and transmission results from cross-
section change (α ≠ 1) and/or temperature change (ξ ≠ 1) only. The
entries of the matrix H model the generation of acoustic waves due
to fluctuations of heat release rate. If considering Eqs. (3) and (6), the

Bomberg et al. [3] introduced a network model diagram associated

response (Eq. (5)) is accounted for. This diagram, depicted in Fig. 3,
allows a clear visualization of the acoustic loop (blue lines) and the ITA
loop (orange lines). Eq. (17) can be rearranged yielding the acoustic

Eq. (19) clearly shows that the poles of the scattering matrix S should

Polifke [31]. The flame scattering matrix S can be lumped with a
scattering matrix describing the reflection at the locations ‘u’ and ‘d’

feedback loop, respectively. The flame element is enclosed in a dashed box and is connected to two inputs (fu and gd) and two outputs (fd and gu).

2.1.2. A compact formulation

Orchini et al. [30] built on the diagram proposed by Bomberg
et al. [3], while considering arbitrary acoustic reflection upstream and
downstream of the flame element. They derived a transfer function
between an external source ̂̇Qn (input) and the upstream velocity ̂uu
(output) as illustrated in Fig. 4. The input and output are related by

̂uu =

N(s)
D(s) − N(s) (s)

̂̇Qn ̄uu∕ ̄̇Q =

1
−  (s)

̂̇Qn ̄uu∕ ̄̇Q.

D(s)
N(s)

(22)

The expressions D(s) and N(s), given in [30], are transcendental func-
tions of s. The thermoacoustic eigenfrequencies of the system are the
solutions of D(s)∕N(s) −  (s) = 0. The latter relation is equivalent to
Eqs. (16) and (21). Similarly to Eq. (16), it is defined for any value of
Rin and Rout.

2.2. The limit of zero gain in the flame response

The limit of zero gain is particularly important when investigating
ITA modes and associated instability. It is possible to envisage two
plausible scenarios, while considering a simple n − τ model as  (s) =
ne−sτ , as n goes to zero.

1. The first scenario reads:

n→0 |ne−sτ
lim

| = 0

2. The second scenario reads:

(23)

β ∼ (1)

| = β, where

n→0 |ne−sτ
lim
| = ne−στ . The
Note that ne−sτ = ne−στ e−iωτ , so that |ne−sτ
quantity β ≡ ne−στ is introduced, which in the limit n → 0 can be
regarded as finite (β ∼ (1)) for σ → −∞. This can be actually
evaluated when reorganizing the expression for β, which results
in σ = ln(n∕β)∕τ. Accordingly, the growth rate σ goes to −∞ as
n goes to zero.

(24)

3. The ITA loop in an anechoic environment

The work of Hoeijmakers was the first in demonstrating, analyt-
ically [4] and then experimentally [17], that a system can exhibit
thermoacoustic instabilities even in the presence of anechoic boundary
conditions. Today, it is known that such an instability occurs because
the ITA loop (see orange loop in Fig. 3) may be unstable, also in the
absence of upstream and downstream acoustic reflection. Hoeijmakers
et al. [4] put forward this observation by making use of a simple
duct configuration, where the flame response is governed by Eq. (5).
In this work, we generalize from that case while considering a flame
within two ducts and the three-duct configuration (see Fig. 2), which
is ubiquitous in combustion systems.

In the presence of anechoic boundary conditions, where Rin =

Rout = 0, the characteristic Eq. (16) reduces to T22(s) = 0:

e−φ1 (1 − αc)(ξ − α − αθ (s)) + eφ1 (1 + αc)(ξ + α + αθ (s)) = 0.

(25)

3.1. Flame within two ducts

A case of relevance emerges when αc = 1, where the cross-section
areas of the plenum and the mid-section (see Fig. 2) are equal a0 = a1.
In that case, Eq. (25) reduces to

ξ + α + αθ (s) = 0.

(26)

The expression for the particular case of a Rijke tube (α = 1) was
first revealed by Hoeijmakers et al. [4] and Emmert et al. [2]. Note
that this expression already appears in the denominator of Eq. (19). As
a result, the eigenfrequencies of the system, which satisfy Eq. (26) –
the eigenfrequencies characterizing the ITA loop – are nothing but the
poles of the scattering matrix S, as pointed out by Bomberg et al. [3].
Emmert et al. [2], influenced by the works of [31,34,35], formally
recognized that in the vicinity of these eigenfrequencies, the acoustic
scattering matrix gain exhibits strong peaks, which implies that, within
this narrow frequency band, there exists a strong acoustic amplification
potential of incoming acoustic disturbances. It is shown in [2] that
such an acoustic amplification, given by the eigenvalues of a so-called
power amplification matrix, can be about two orders of magnitude for
the turbulent combustor investigated in that study. Emmert et al. [2]
also propose an instability potentiality criterion based on the acoustic
scattering matrix of the flame, leveraged on the work of Aurégan and
Starobinski [35]. Note that the eigenfrequencies characterizing the ITA
loop do not correspond to frequencies of gain maxima of the acoustic
flame response, as clearly shown in [3].

Eq. (26) has solutions only if  (s) is real-valued and negative:

 (s) = −

quantities with different signs. Without loss of generality, all quantities are exemplified
as real valued for simplicity.

because ξ, α and θ are strictly positive and real valued. It follows that
the phase φ of the flame response  (s) is given by φ = −(2k + 1)π
for k ∈ N
0, as discussed in [2,4]. Note that the phase φ is stipulated
to be negative, which is helpful in the analysis of causal mechanisms:
fluctuations of heat release rate should lag and not lead fluctuations of
upstream velocity. This condition for the phase φ may be recognized
as the −π criterion [36]. Let us now rewrite Eq. (6) as

̂ud = α ̂uu + ̂uq,

(28)

 (s) represents the contribution to ̂ud of the flame
where ̂uq = αθ ̂uu
dynamics [20], as graphically represented in Fig. 5. Knowing that fu =
gd = 0, we observe that the acoustic velocity changes sign across the
flame: ̂uu = −gu and ̂ud = fd as per Eq. (8). Note that gu and fd must
exhibit the same sign in order to satisfy ̂pu = ̂pd (see Fig. 5). The change
of sign of acoustic velocity across the flame has been recognized in
Yong et al. [20] as a fundamental characteristic of the velocity acoustic
field associated with ITA modes.

Consider now the simple n − τ model as  (s) = ne−sτ , where n ≥ 0
and τ ≥ 0 stand for the interaction index and time delay, respectively.
Replacing the flame model into Eq. (26) leads to

which implies that ITA modes oscillate at a frequency ω = (2k + 1)π∕τ
with a growth rate σ = ln(nαθ∕(ξ + α))∕τ. The critical value of the
interaction index can be computed from the neutral stability condition
σ = 0. It yields

nc =

ξ + α
αθ

,

(30)

which corresponds to the results of [2,4]. This expression puts forward
the idea that an anechoic system can indeed be unstable for values of
the flame response gain beyond a well-defined threshold, n > nc.

After the analytical propositions of [2–4], it was natural that numer-
ical evidence – as a solution of the reactive, compressible Navier–Stokes
equations – was also included in follow-up studies. Two concurrent
numerical works by [18,19] investigated the acoustic response of a
laminar Bunsen-type flame and the scenario of self acoustic excitation
in the absence of acoustic reflection at both the inlet and outlet. Results
revealed that ITA instabilities can indeed be recovered via high-fidelity
numerical simulation.

Courtine et al. [18] studied a configuration where a0 = a1

≠ a2 (see
Fig. 2). They explored systematic variations of the burner geometry,
particularly the cross-section area of the combustion chamber a2. In
the first part of that work, the flame response is calculated via Direct
Numerical Simulation (DNS) under harmonic forcing, and subsequently
fitted to a n − τ description of the flame at a specific frequency of
interest. The obtained n − τ model was integrated within a thermoa-
coustic network, where different areas a2 of the combustion chamber

were explored. It was shown there is a threshold of the value a2, where
the system becomes thermoacoustically unstable. The network model
results suggest that the growth rate of the thermoacoustic mode under
investigation increases as a2 decreases. Note that those results are in
agreement with Eq. (30), as higher values of α correspond to lower
values of nc, which indicate that weak flames (associated to low values
of n) can render the system unstable if α increases. The frequency of
oscillation is predicted to be f = 1∕(2τ) (see Eq. (29)). In the second
part of the study, several DNS are performed for several values of
the combustion chamber cross-section a2. The DNS becomes unstable
for a2 < threshold. During the exponential growth (linear regime),
which occurs before the system reaches a limit cycle, the oscillations
exhibit a frequency of 68 Hz, which is close to that predicted by the
network model (71 Hz). It is therefore concluded that the observed
thermoacoustic instability is of ITA origin.

Similarly to [18], Silva et al. [19] makes use of both DNS and a
network modeling approach. Two geometries are considered. The first
geometry (case A, where a0 = a1 as per Fig. 2) is thermoacoustically
stable. By means of broadband forcing, the unit impulse response
characterizing the flame dynamics under study is obtained. Note that
the obtained impulse response can be understood as a collection of
distributed time delays and is therefore a more detailed model than the
one given by an n − τ model. By using the Fourier transform, such an
impulse response is mapped to the corresponding frequency response,
where both gain and phase are frequency-dependent. The obtained
flame response is subsequently introduced into the network model of
≠ a1 as per Fig. 2), where a
the second geometry (case B, where a0
thermoacoustic stability is predicted at a frequency, where φ = −π,
i.e. a frequency equal to 152 Hz, characterizing the ITA feedback loop
(see Eq. (27)). In a final step, a DNS is carried out on the geometry of
case B. The system is thermoacoustically unstable, and the associated
limit cycle oscillates at a frequency equal to 164 Hz, which is fairly
close to that of the ITA feedback loop. Note that this frequency is much
lower than the first natural frequency of the system, predicted above
8000 Hz. It is therefore concluded that the instability is of ITA nature.

Example 1

Fig. 6 shows the eigenfrequencies of the system ‘Two-Ducts’ with
dimensions shown in Table 1. This system exhibits the same dimensions
as the turbulent swirled combustor (BRS) investigated next, except for
the plenum cross-section a0 as we consider αc = a0∕a1 = 1. The
software taX3 [37], an acoustic simulation tool based on multi-port
interconnected models, is used for the calculations. Fig. 6 is evidence
of the validity of Eq. (29): ω corresponds to odd multiples of π∕τ and σ
goes to minus infinity as n goes to zero. Note that values of the growth
rate are also well estimated by Eq. (29), which also puts forward the
validity of Eq. (30), which estimates the critical gain nc.

3.2. Flame in a three-duct configuration

Consider now the more general case αc

≠ 1. Eq. (25) in this form is
not amenable for carrying out a simple analysis. In order to derive an
equivalent yet more gentle expression, we consider the jump conditions
(see Fig. 2) at the cross section ‘uc-dc’

̂pdc = ̂puc ⇒ fdc + gdc = guc

̂udc = ̂uucαc ⇒ fdc − gdc = −αcguc

and at the flame

where the acoustic pressure and velocity are expressed in terms of

boundary conditions imply fuc = gd = 0. Eqs. (31) and (32) are
combined while accounting for TD1 (fdc = fueφ1 and gdc = gue−φ1 as
per Eq. (12))

[

]
tan(ωl1∕cu)
. We consider now cases where the mid-section length l1
satisfies ωl1∕cu < π∕2. In those cases, i.e. where αc ≫ 1 and α ≪ 1, the
flame response should satisfy  (ω) ≈ −i|
 (ω)|e−iπ∕2e−i2kπ =
 (ω)|e−i(4k+1)π∕2 for k ∈ N
0. We conclude that a three-duct configura-

tion with strong contractions at the planes ‘uc-dc’ and ‘u-d’ exhibits a
phase in the flame response of −π∕2 (modulo 2π) in neutrally stable
cases, where σ = 0. This result was labeled ‘π∕2 criterion’ in Albayrak
et al. [36].

 (ω)| = |

In order to obtain a simplified expression of Eq. (36), it is useful to
invoke the acoustic compactness assumption of the mid-section duct,
as done in [36]. Such an assumption allows the approximation eφ1 ≈
1 + φ1. Replacing such an expression in Eq. (25) (or Eq. (36)) and
keeping only first order terms in the angle φ1 yields

Eq. (36) is equivalent to Eq. (25). Note also that Eq. (26) is recov-
ered when αc = 1. Consider now the n − τ model and recall that

(37)

Eq. (36) in this limit becomes

 (s) =

(38)

which differs from Eq. (27). It follows that the phase of  (s) is given
by φ = −2kπ if ξ > α and φ = −(2k + 1)π if ξ < α, for k ∈ N

0.

Let us study now the neutrally stable case, where σ = 0. The right
hand side of Eq. (36) is complex and strongly depends on αc , α and φ1.
A system exhibiting a strong contraction at the inlet is characterized by
αc ≫ 1 and can be represented by

Fig. 7 shows the eigenfrequencies of the turbulent premixed com-
bustor known as ‘BRS’, calculated using the numerical tool taX. This
configuration, with dimensions listed in Table 1, has been widely
studied in the past [13,38–40]. Note that the limit for n → 0 is
associated with a phase φ characterized by even multiples of −π, as
determined by Eq. (38). Accordingly, the frequency ω is defined by
even multiples of π∕τ. This result opposes those of the Two-Duct case
(see Fig. 6). Consider now the neutral stable case characterized by the
growth rate σ = 0. It is observed that all trajectories depicted in Fig. 7
cross or approach the neutral axis at approximately ω = (4k+1)(π∕2)∕τ,
which corresponds to a phase φ = −(4k + 1)π∕2 for k ∈ N
0. Stronger
area contractions (than the ones defined by the parameters of Table 1)
at both inlet and outlet imply that ω at the neutral axis is closer to
(4k + 1)(π∕2)∕τ, as illustrated in Fig. 8, where the black curve is closer
than the gray one to the red curve. In Fig. 8, the orange and green
circles represent the frequency and phase φ associated with the crossing
points of the trajectories shown in Fig. 7. Note that points get closer to
ω = (4k + 1)(π∕2)∕τ for values of φ1 ≈ 1. Fig. 8 also shows that the
approximation given by Eq. (40), denoted by ‘◦’, delivers very accurate
results for most of the range φ1 ∈ [0, π∕2].

4. The ITA loop in an environment with fully reflecting boundary
conditions

After investigating the ITA feedback loop in an anechoic environ-
ment, it becomes pertinent to study this loop in an environment with
no acoustic losses, where the acoustic boundaries are fully reflecting.

where φ = −iωτ. Anechoic boundaries are considered (Rin = Rout = 0 in Fig. 2). Calculations are performed using the software taX [37].

interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

Similarly as Section 3 we pay special attention to two cases: the limit
of zero gain of the flame response and the neutral stable case, where
σ = 0. For the sake of generality, we will focus on the three-duct
configuration displayed in Fig. 2. More simple cases, such as the duct-
flame configuration, can be evaluated as particular cases by the setting
the parameters αc and α to unity.

4.1. Case of zero gain limit

Mukherjee and Shrira [41] were the first to discuss in detail the
 (s)| → 0) for a simple 1D configuration (Rijke
case of zero gain limit (|
tube) with fully reflecting boundary conditions. They demonstrated
analytically that aside from the set of perturbed acoustic modes (see
classic paradigm), there is a set of thermoacoustic modes found at
very large negative growth rates that exhibit frequencies equal to those
of pure ITA modes. Later, Orchini et al. [30] generalized the results
of [41] for a given 1D configuration with fully or partially reflecting
acoustic boundaries.

The stability of the system of interest can be equivalently charac-
terized by Eqs. (16), (21) or (22). When investigating the case of zero
gain limit, the formulation given by Eq. (22) is very well suited. By
recalling that the thermoacoustic eigenfrequencies of the system are
the solutions of D(s)∕N(s) −  (s) = 0, it is possible to envisage two
scenarios, while considering a simple n − τ model as  (s) = ne−sτ .
Following Section 2.2, the first scenario limn→0 |ne−sτ
| = 0 implies

D(s) = 0, which delivers the solution of the system acoustic modes.
| = β ∼ (1) implies σ → −∞. Orchini

conditions) as long as Rin, Rout
Eq. (41) becomes ξ + α + αθ (ω) = 0, which is the same expression
characterizing the ITA loop in a burner with anechoic terminations (see
Eq. (26)). The implications for φ are the same as discussed for Eq. (27),
and therefore φ = −(2k + 1)π for k ∈ N
0. Note that equal results
are obtained when dividing Eq. (16) by (e−φ1 e−φ2 e−φ3 ) and applying
limσ→−∞ eφi = 0.

4.2. Case of neutral stability

Let us now discuss the neutrally stable case (σ = 0). Making use of
Eqs. (16), (21) or (22) results in convoluted mathematical expressions
not helpful for a simple analysis. This remains true even for the case of
fully reflecting boundary conditions (|Rin| = |Rout| = 1). At this stage it
is helpful to carry out a phasors analysis on the jump conditions at both
locations ‘uc-dc’ and ‘u-d’ (see Fig. 2), as performed at the beginning of
Section 3.2. Fig. 9 illustrates the phasor analysis that follows. We focus
on the case Rin = 1 (closed inlet) and Rout = −1 (open outlet). Note
that similar expressions, as the ones presented below, can be recovered

Assuming Rin = 1 implies fin = gin. The right-hand side of Eqs. (42)
and (43) is greatly simplified becoming 2 cos ̃φ0fin and −i 2 sin ̃φ0fin,
respectively. Note that we have introduced the notation ̃φ = φ∕i = ωl∕c
(see text below Eq. (12) for comparison). Because the right-hand side
of Eqs. (42) and (43) is purely real and purely imaginary, respectively,
it is necessary that Gef = Geg and φef = φeg at the left-hand side. The
jump conditions at the cross-section change simplify to

2 cos( ̃φ0 + ̃φe)Gefin = 2 cos ̃φ0fin

−i 2 sin( ̃φ0 + ̃φe)Gefin = −i 2 sin ̃φ0αcfin,

and can be combined resulting in

Eq. (46) holds for any value of Rout. Consider now the jump conditions
at the flame element (Eqs. (3) and (6)), where Eq. (8) is accounted for
and fu = e−φ1 fdc, gu = eφ1 gdc, fd = ieφ2 fout and gd = ie−φ2 gout (see
TD1(s) and TD2(s) in Eq. (12) and Fig. 9 (c, d, e)):

̂pd = ̂pu ⇒ ieφ2 fout + ie−φ2 gout = 2ξ cos( ̃φ0 + ̃φe + ̃φ1)Gefin

(47)

̂ud = ̂uuα(1 + θ (s)) ⇒ ieφ2 fout − ie−φ2 gout = −i 2 sin( ̃φ0 + ̃φe

(48)

Eqs. (47) and (48) are greatly simplified for an open outlet, where
Rout = −1 (fout = −gout), and become

−2 sin ̃φ2 gout = 2ξ cos( ̃φ0 + ̃φe + ̃φ1)Gefin
i2 cos ̃φ2 gout = −i 2 sin( ̃φ0 + ̃φe + ̃φ1)Geα(1 + θ (ω))fin

Finally, Eqs. (49) and (50) are combined yielding

cot( ̃φ2) cot( ̃φ0 + ̃φe + ̃φ1).

(51)

Note that the right-hand side of Eq. (51) is real valued. Accordingly, the
 (ω)|eiφ must be also real, which in turn
frequency response  (ω) = |
makes necessary the condition φ = −kπ for k ∈ N
0. This observation
has been recently made in Yong et al. [20] for a duct configuration,
where αc = α = 1. Mukherjee and Shrira [41] arrived at an equivalent
formulation to the one of [20]. Nevertheless, [41] assumed that the
condition φ = −kπ was exclusively valid for ITA modes. From Yong
et al. [20] we now know that Eq. (51) applies to any eigenfrequency
at the neutral axis of the complex plane and not exclusively to those
referring to ITA modes. This has an interesting implication: the phase of
a given transfer function  (ω) is fixed to be a multiple of π at marginal
stability (for systems well approximated by fully reflecting boundary
conditions and no damping), which in turns implies that the oscillation
frequency ω is solely dependent on the phase of the flame response via
φ(ω) = −kπ.

Example 3

Fig. 10 shows the eigenfrequencies of the BRS combustor (see
Table 1) calculated by taX [37], while assuming a closed inlet and an
open outlet. We make use of the n − τ model so that φ = −iωτ. We
identify two types of trajectories:

(i) ITA trajectories composed by eigenfrequencies, where the growth
rate σ goes to −∞ as n goes to zero. These eigenfrequencies are
labeled ‘Born Intrinsic’ in [42] and of ‘ITA origin’ in [30].

(ii) Acoustic trajectories composed by eigenfrequencies, where the
growth rate σ goes to zero as n goes to zero. These eigenfre-
quencies are labeled ‘Born Acoustic’ in Mukherjee and Shrira [42]
and of ‘acoustic origin’ in Orchini et al. [30]. Acoustic trajec-
tories are largely studied under the classical paradigm, because
the tracking of thermoacoustic eigenfrequencies departing from
acoustic eigenfrequencies is a standard technique to associate a
given thermoacoustic mode to an acoustic one.

We observe that in the limit of n → 0, the eigenfrequencies associ-
ated with the ITA trajectories go to (2k + 1)π∕τ because the equation
ξ + α + αθ (ω) must be satisfied in this limit, as discussed at the
beginning of this section. Fig. 10 also shows that both acoustic and ITA
trajectories cross the neutral axis at frequencies ω that are either even
or odd multiples of π∕τ. It should be highlighted that the frequency
at these limits (σ → −∞ and σ → 0) remains unchanged if the
flame is assumed to be placed at a finite distance with respect to the

where φ = −iωτ. A closed inlet (Rin = 1) and an open outlet (Rout = −1) are considered. Calculations are performed using the software taX [37].

burner mouth. To arrive at such results a similar phasor analysis as that
illustrated in Fig. 9 can be carried out.

4.4. What about acoustic losses?

4.3. Changing the position of the flame with respect to the dump plane

Changing the position of the flame downstream of the dump plane,
as sketched in Fig. 11 (left), changes some results. For example, the
critical gain – formulated in Eq. (30) or implicitly given by Eq. (51) –
is (slightly) affected. Nevertheless, the value of the resonance frequency
of the ITA feedback loop and the value of the frequency as a function
of the phase of the flame response (φ = −kπ) in the region of marginal
stability (for both anechoic and fully reflecting boundary conditions)
remains unchanged.

The last statement is explained here by means of a phasors diagram,
shown in Fig. 11 as analogous to Fig. 9. The phasors fup and gup can
be understood as phasors obtained by a rotation of fin (clockwise)
and gin (counter-clockwise), respectively. Subsequently, a rotation and
elongation of fup and gup, which follow Eqs. (42) and (43), is applied
so that fdp and gdp are obtained. Afterwards, fdp and gdp are rotated
by an angle that depends on the distance lf of the flame with respect to
the dump plane (see Fig. 11). By doing so, fu and gu are recovered.
Note that the array of g arrows is symmetric with respect to the f
arrows in the case of ideal boundary conditions at the inlet and outlet.
Therefore, the quantities ̂uu = fu − gu and ̂uup = fup − gup (see Fig. 11)
point downwards and are all aligned. It should be highlighted that
the condition across the flame ̂ud = ̂uu + ̂uq (see Eq. (48)) must be
satisfied, where ̂uq = ̂uupαθ . Accordingly, the quantity αθ acts on
̂uup by elongating it (scenario 1) or elongating and flipping it (scenario
2). It is then concluded that equation ̂udc = ̂uu + ̂uupαθ is only satisfied
for a phase of the flame response equal to φ = −kπ.

The exclusion of acoustic losses simplifies the thermoacoustic prob-
lem at its maximum. By excluding damping – by neglecting acoustic
dissipation at boundaries or by suppressing volumetric acoustic sinks
– it is possible to highlight special features of ITA modes, such as, for
example, the frequency of resonance of marginally stable modes, and
the direct association of this frequency with the phase of the flame
response (see Example 3).

Not only the introduction of damping but also the way it is intro-
duced (acoustic dissipation at boundaries or volumetric sinks within
the domain) affect the estimated thermoacoustic eigenfrequencies. On
the one hand, when acoustic dissipation is introduced at the bound-
aries, the shift of the eigenfrequencies on the complex plane can be
understood as a rotation and/or translation of the acoustic and ITA
trajectories. This was studied by Yong et al. [43], where it was shown
that reducing the acoustic reflection at the inlet of a longitudinal
combustor induces a downward translation of these structures (see
Fig. 7 of that study), whereas reducing the acoustic reflection at the
outlet causes mainly a rotation of the structures (see Fig. 6 of that
study). Note that in these cases, the growth rate of some modes can
shift to higher values, which is the paradoxical observation discussed
in Section 7: damping devices can trigger thermoacoustic instabilities.
On the other hand, accounting for a volumetric acoustic sink via an
l − ζ model at the burner element [44,45] produces a different shift of
the aforementioned structures. To this day, such an influence – briefly
shown in Example 4 – has not been shown in the literature.

Example 4

Fig. 12, based on the test case of Example 3, shows the influence of
a simplified l−ζ model at the burner element, where Eq. (3) is replaced

inlet (Rin = 1) and an open outlet (Rout = −1) are considered. The blue arrows point toward increasing loss, where ζ ∈ [0, 5]. The acoustic eigenfrequency is depicted as a black

by ̂pd = ̂pu − ̄ρu ̄cuζMu ̂uu. Here, M stands for the Mach number and ζ
denotes a loss coefficient due to viscous and fluid dynamics effects [45].
The effect of such losses on the eigenfrequencies lying in the vicinity of
the acoustic eigenfrequency is mainly dissipative, as shown for example
in Fig. 12 (block a) by the blue arrows, which point toward increasing
loss. Note that the acoustic eigenfrequency is depicted as a black star
when ζ = 0 and as a gray star when ζ = 5, which is the maximum value
here and within the range of usual values found in the literature (see
for example [46] or [24]). The effect of the l−ζ acoustic loss on the ITA
related eigenfrequencies is counterintuitive (see block b for example),
as it mainly induces a change in the frequency and not in the growth
rate. Along the real axis (where σ = 0), the change in growth rate
is indeed very small in comparison. These results reveal that further
studies are needed, where the effect of dissipation in its different forms
– acoustic dissipation through boundaries (when modeling inlet, outlet
and walls), or volumetric acoustic losses within the system domain
(when modeling area changes or burner induced acoustic dissipation)
– on the thermoacoustic eigenfrequencies related to ITA resonance
should be investigated.

In closing this section, it is worth highlighting that key results in
Sections 3 and 4 – such as Eqs. (25), (26), (36), (40) and (51) – are
general as they do not depend on a given particular flame model.
Subsequently, the n − τ model is introduced only to carry out further
analysis. Accordingly, it is possible to state, for example, that φ =
−ωτ = −kπ, so that f = k∕(2τ) for k ∈ N
0 in a configuration with closed
inlet and open outlet at the region of marginal stability. Additionally,
the use of an n − τ model leads to a simple quantitative description of
a critical gain nc (see Eqs. (29) and (30) for the anechoic case or (51)
with  (ω) = nce−ikπ for a case with closed inlet and open outlet).

5. Categorization of ITA modes in reflective environments

Understanding key features in the spatial structure of thermoacous-
tic modes of ITA or acoustic nature may be of relevance for their
subsequent control. Section 7 shows that thermoacoustic modes of

ITA nature can be destabilized by increasing acoustic dissipation at
some boundaries: a counter-intuitive behavior of ITA modes recently
observed in experiments [47]. As a result, it may be wise to categorize
thermoacoustic modes as ITA or acoustic.

Below, we discuss several studies, which propose techniques to iden-

tify thermoacoustic modes of ITA nature in reflective environments.

5.1. Essential features of ITA modes

Several works suggest that there are essential features of acoustic
and ITA modes when confronted with variations of a characteristic
time delay τ of the flame response or with variations of the combustor
geometry, such as a given alteration of the combustion chamber length.
These studies combine experiments and modeling based on network
representation of acoustic and ITA feedback loops. Supported by exper-
imental data of combustion noise for several mean flow velocities and
swirler positions, Albayrak et al. [36] demonstrate that the frequency
of thermoacoustic modes associated with the ITA feedback loop scales
with the time delay τ. Such a clear dependence of frequency on τ should
be an essential feature of ITA modes as discussed in early theoretical
studies [2–4]. Similarly, Xu et al. [47] and Murugesan et al. [48] show
in their experimental work the strong dependence of frequencies of
unstable ITA modes on characteristic time delays of the flame response.
Whereas the time delay in the study of [47] is a function of the
equivalence ratio, the one in the study of [48] scales directly with the
inlet mass flow rate. The works [47,48] also give experimental evidence
that frequencies of ITA modes do not scale with the length of the
combustion chamber, contrary to what is observed in thermoacoustic
modes associated with the acoustic feedback loop. Note that, similar
to Eckstein et al. [10], Murugesan et al. [48] initially suspected the
observed thermoacoustic instabilities to be the outcome of acoustic-
entropy coupling. After a careful study, where the entropy modes were
ruled out, they identified the ITA feedback loop to be responsible for the
oscillations observed in the partially premixed combustor investigated.

5.2. Identifying ITA modes

The following studies propose additional methods that should help
to clarify the nature of a given thermoacoustic mode. With the excep-
tion of Yong et al. [20], they all rely exclusively on thermoacoustic
models and associated parametric variations.

5.2.1. The μ criterion - Emmert et al. [39]

Emmert et al. [39] suggest rearranging the equations describing the
flame and the adjacent acoustic elements so that the entire system,
written as a 6 × 6 matrix, could be expressed as a collection of
block matrices (see Eq. (17) in that study). Such a structure enables
interpretation of the thermoacoustic system as two coupled subsystems
(diagonal blocks: acoustic and ITA), where the coupling is characterized
by an artificial parameter μ, encountered in the off-diagonal blocks.
When μ is tuned to zero, the thermoacoustic modes decouple in two
distinct, disjoint sets of modes: pure acoustic modes4 and pure ITA
modes, which are exclusively characterized by the acoustic and ITA
loop, respectively (see blue and orange circuits in Fig. 3). They also sug-
gest labeling as ‘acoustic mode’ any thermoacoustic mode converging
to a pure acoustic mode as μ → 0. Such acoustic modes should be seen
as pure acoustic modes that are perturbed by the flame when μ → 1, as
per the classical paradigm. They also recommend labeling as ‘ITA mode’
any thermoacoustic mode converging to a pure ITA mode as μ → 0.
The case of μ → 1 should be then seen as pure ITA modes affected
by the surrounding acoustic elements. Emmert et al. [39] investigate
the thermoacoustic modes of a turbulent swirled combustor under a
fully reflecting inlet and a partially reflecting outlet, and classified the
thermoacoustic modes by the proposed ‘μ’ method. Importantly, they
recognize that the entire set of thermoacoustic modes are the union of
(their definition of) acoustic and ITA modes.

One drawback of [39] tracking technique is that it strongly depends
on the acoustic state of the system and, hence, may lack robustness: a
slightly different acoustic state (a slighter larger acoustic reflection at
the outlet, for example) may induce a sudden change in the conver-
gence limit (acoustic instead of ITA, or vice versa), as recently shown
in Ghani and Polifke [49].

5.2.2. The reflection criterion - Hosseini et al. [50]

Although elegant, the ‘μ’ method proposed by [39] does not offer
a physical interpretation of the parameter μ. As a result, [50] tackle
the problem by varying four physical parameters – inlet and outlet
acoustic reflection, temperature ratio through the flame (which directly
influences the flame response strength) and the time delay τ of the
flame response – and by analyzing asymptotic limits. They propose a
parametric study on a Rijke tube by means of a simple acoustic network
model, while using an n − τ model for the acoustic flame response.
They define ‘pure ITA’ modes as the thermoacoustic modes that exist in
anechoic thermoacoustic systems. This definition is analogous to that
of Emmert et al. [39], as pure ITA modes are exclusively characterized
by the ITA circuit. Hosseini et al. [50] propose two limiting cases in
the limit of zero acoustic reflection: a given thermoacoustic mode can
either become a pure ITA mode or vanish. In the former case, the
thermoacoustic mode is associated with pure ITA modes and is called
‘ITA mode’, whereas in the latter case, the thermoacoustic mode is
associated with an acoustic resonance mode of the system and is called
‘acoustic mode’.5

4 In their study they talk of ‘pure acoustic modes’, whose definition is
the same of ‘acoustic modes’ we introduce in this study (see sentence before
Section 1.1).

5 The definition of ‘acoustic mode’ of [39,50] differs from that of the present
review paper, as in their definition an acoustic mode is influenced by the flame
dynamics.

5.2.3. The n criterion - Mukherjee and Shrira [41]

Mukherjee and Shrira [41] demonstrate analytically that, aside from
the set of perturbed acoustic modes (see classic paradigm), there exists
a set of thermoacoustic modes found at very large negative growth
rates that exhibit frequencies equal to those of pure ITA modes (see
Section 4.1). Accordingly, they label as ‘ITA mode’ any thermoacoustic
mode converging to that set of modes (as n → 0). They also show that
the growth rate of such ITA modes increases as n increases and may
become positive beyond a critical value of n.

5.2.4. Only limiting cases apply - Orchini et al. [30]

Orchini et al. [30] emphasize that there are inconsistencies when
labeling a given thermoacoustic mode as ITA mode by means of param-
eter variation asymptotics: a given thermoacoustic mode can converge
both to a pure ITA mode in the limit of zero acoustic reflection and
to an acoustic mode in the limit of zero gain of the flame response
(see Example 5 below). Labeling a thermoacoustic mode as an ITA or
acoustic mode outside of the two aforementioned limiting cases (zero
acoustic reflection ⇒ only ITA modes exist; zero gain of the flame
response ⇒ only acoustic modes exist) is problematic. They highlight,
nevertheless, that a given thermoacoustic mode shares features of both
ITA and acoustic modes.

5.2.5. The velocity phasors criterion - Yong et al. [20]

Recently Yong et al. [20] proposed a classification of thermoacous-
tic modes at the neutral axis of the complex plane that does not rely
on parametric variation. This is of fundamental importance given the
fact that varying thermodynamic or geometrical parameters of a given
combustion system is rarely possible in practice. Based on a Rijke tube
configuration with fully acoustic reflecting boundaries, they leverage
on phasor analysis and observe that the velocity phasors upstream
and downstream of the flame can be parallel or antiparallel. In the
former case, the thermoacoustic modes are categorized as ‘acoustic’ as
their shape and corresponding resonance frequency are close to those
characterizing the acoustic cavity. In the latter case, the thermoacoustic
modes, aside from presenting resonance frequencies far from the natu-
ral frequencies of the acoustic cavity, exhibit a characteristic feature on
the acoustic mode shape related to the pressure gradient at the flame
region. Such a feature should be the key characteristic of an ITA mode
according to [20]. Example 6 will focus on these observations.

Example 5

Fig. 13 shows several cases that illustrate the possibly contradictory
definitions of Hosseini et al. [50] and Mukherjee et al. [41]. Consider
a flame in a closed-inlet, open-outlet duct with dimensions given in
Hoeijmakers et al. [4] and an n − τ flame model, where n ∈ [1 × 10−6, 1]
and τ = 0.6 ms (left) or τ = 1.6 ms (right). Decreasing the interaction
index n to zero in the eigenfrequencies denoted as ‘B’ and ‘C’ induces a
large negative growth rate that goes to −∞. According to [41], such
an observation would imply that the eigenmodes related to ‘B’ and
‘C’ are ITA modes. Consider now instead a gradual reduction of the
acoustic reflection |R| at both inlet and outlet until reaching complete
anechoic conditions, while maintaining n = 1. It is observed that the
thermoacoustic eigenfrequencies ‘B’ and ‘C’ become infinitely damped
(vanish) for zero acoustic reflection. Following the description of ITA
modes given by [50], the eigenmodes related to ‘B’ and ‘C’ cannot
be ITA modes. Consider now the eigenfrequencies denoted as ‘A’, ‘D’,
‘E’. Reducing the interaction index n to zero leads to a growth rate
equal to zero and a frequency equal to the natural frequencies of the
system. This observation may lead us to think that the thermoacoustic
modes corresponding to ‘A’, ‘D’ and ‘E’ are acoustic modes. Analyze now
the case where the acoustic reflection |R| is reduced to zero at both
the inlet and outlet. Whereas the eigenfrequencies ‘A’ and ‘E’ become
infinitely damped in this anechoic limit – as expected for an acoustic
mode according to [50] – the eigenfrequency denoted with ‘D’ does not

vanish in the anechoic limit, which would imply that the eigenmode
related to ‘D’ is not an acoustic but an ITA mode.

Table 2 summarizes the discussed results. Additionally, it shows
the classification results obtained by applying the μ criterion [39] to
the same thermoacoustic modes. At this point it can be concluded that
‘acoustic’ or ‘ITA’ definitions that depend on parameter variation may
be inconsistent.

Example 6

While considering an anechoic environment, Yong et al. [20] iden-
tified the change in sign of acoustic velocity across the flame (see ̂uu
and ̂ud in Fig. 5) as one of the key features characterizing marginally
stable thermoacoustic modes, which can exhibit either a strong acoustic
or strong ITA nature. Note that in their study, such thermoacoustic
modes are simply called acoustic or ITA modes. Thermoacoustic modes
of a strong acoustic (ITA) nature should exhibit the same (different)
sign in ̂uu and ̂ud according to [20]. Based on a phasor analysis along
the neutral axis of the complex plane, they identify that ̂ud = 0 →
1 + θ (ω) = 0 (see Eq. (28)) should define the threshold 
th(ω) ≡ −1∕θ
between thermoacoustic modes with a strong acoustic and ITA nature.
Eq. (51) defines the value of  (ω) associated with marginally stable
thermoacoustic modes (σ = 0). This equation is solved for  (ω) and
plotted against ω in Fig. 14, while considering the BRS combustor
(see Fig. 2 and Table 1). For the range of frequencies considered, a
curve that crosses twice 
th (vertical dashed line) is found. To the
right (left) of this curve, depicted in blue (red), thermoacoustic modes
with a strong acoustic (ITA) nature are found [20]. Note that the blue
curve crosses the vertical zero line at two points (black squares), which
represent the first and second acoustic modes ω1 and ω2. Fig. 14 shows
examples of two thermoacoustic modes with a strong acoustic nature
(blue boxes c and d). They correspond to the first mode (d - Helmholtz
mode of the plenum) and second mode (c - quarter wave mode of the
combustion chamber) of the BRS combustor. Away from the natural

frequencies (ω1 and ω2) two thermoacoustic modes of strong ITA nature
(red boxes a and b) are shown. Note that the slope of the acoustic
pressure just upstream and downstream of the flame location (depicted
with an orange circle) exhibits different signs in its gradient (see dashed
lines adjacent to the orange circle). Such a feature, which is directly
related to the different sign of ̂uu and ̂ud (see Fig. 5), should be of help
when identifying the predominant nature of a given thermoacoustic
mode according to [20]. It is also worth mentioning that the modes
depicted here are all connected in a continuous way by the ‘parameter’
 (ω). This is easily explained when assuming an n − τ model. Consider
 (ω) = −nc = nce−iωτ , where ωτ = π so that  (ω) < 0. nc represents
the critical value of the interaction index for which σ = 0: values
n > nc imply σ > 0 (and vice versa). Let us now analyze four cases
(see blue circles and red triangles in Fig. 14) for which nc = 0.11 (blue
circles at  (ω) = −0.11) and nc = 0.54 (red triangles at  (ω) = −0.54).
From Eq. (51) the values of τ for the cases d, b, a, c are respectively
τ = 9.1 ms, 8 ms, 2.41 ms and 2.2 ms. As a result, if τ is seen as a
control parameter, it is possible to tune it so that either thermoacoustic
modes with a strong acoustic or ITA nature can be obtained. Note
that the latter modes, which are far away from the natural frequencies
of the system, can only emerge for sufficiently large values of n. For
example, exciting a thermoacoustic mode between 500–1000 rad/s
requires more acoustic energy from the flame than that needed to excite
thermoacoustic modes with a strong acoustic nature, which are close to
ω1 and ω2.

It should be noted that the work of Yong et al. [20] only offers a
classification method for marginal stable cases. An extension of this
method to the entire complex plane would be desirable, as proposed
recently by Yong et al. [52].

6. Parametric maps and exceptional points

As shown by Mukherjee and Shrira [41], the set of thermoacoustic
modes found at infinite decay rates in the limit of zero gain of the
flame response gradually move towards the neutral axis of the com-
plex plane and may eventually become unstable as the gain of the
flame response increases. An interplay between these and the so-called
perturbed acoustic modes may also exist for non-negligible values of
the flame response gain. Such an outcome inspired several follow up
studies aimed at creating thermoacoustic maps of typical systems –
such as the Rijke tube or the three-duct configuration – for a wide
yet realistic range of values of the parameters n and τ representing a
generic flame response. These studies strive for a clear representation

of eigenfrequencies in the complex plane in order to identify eventual
characteristic structures in the corresponding loci.

Silva et al. [53] calculated all eigenfrequencies in the vicinity of
the first acoustic mode as both parameters n and τ vary. Two main
structures in the map are identified. On the one hand, a set of concentric
orbits around f1, as displayed in Fig. 15 (left) where f1 = 254 Hz, are
observed. These orbits are composed by perturbed acoustic eigenfre-
quencies: in the limit of n → 0, these thermoacoustic eigenfrequencies
collapse onto the closest acoustic eigenfrequency (the center of the
orbits). As n increases, these circular trajectories evolve in a ‘star-like’
structure (see Fig. 15 (right)). Along each trajectory, n varies while τ
remains fixed. These loci are called acoustic trajectories in [53] as they
converge to f1 in the limit of zero n (see Example 3 in Section 4).
On the other hand, a collection of quasi-vertical trajectories, labeled
ITA trajectories, are observed (see Example 3 in Section 4). For small
values of n, the growth rate of the eigenfrequencies belonging to these
trajectories is negative and large, and goes to minus infinity as n goes
to zero. Silva et al. [54] studied this kinds of thermoacoustic map
for three axial combustors that are apparently very distinct, as they
are defined by different geometric and thermodynamic parameters (see

Fig. 16. Three thermoacoustic maps in the vicinity of the first acoustic mode are shown for three different combustors, each with a different range of n and τ. The crosses
displayed denote the location of an EP. The geometrical and thermodynamic parameters of these three configurations can be found in Table 3. The growth rate is here defined as
σ∕(2π).

Π1 is labeled flame potency, which encompasses the intensity of the
heat release rate nK and the strength of the flame-acoustic interaction
φk,k. Π2 is recognized as a non-dimensional time lag of the flame. By
using these two non-dimensional groups to portray such thermoacoustic
maps, they show that acoustic and ITA trajectories corresponding to
three different axial combustors collapse in unique acoustic and ITA
trajectories (see Fig. 4 of [54], reproduced in here as Fig. 17). The
collapsing of thermoacoustic maps thereby implies a strong thermoa-
coustic similarity between three axial combustors that at first sight
are very different. Silva et al. [54] also notes that some combustors
are more prone to ITA instabilities than others, as their corresponding
flame potency can be large even though n may be small.

Figs. 16 and 17 evidence also that there is a region in the complex
plane that is scarcely populated with eigenfrequencies. Such a sparsity
is due to a strong sensitivity of the eigenfrequencies to changes in
the value of the parameters under consideration (n and τ). Mensah
et al. [55] identified that this strong sensitivity is caused by the
presence of an Exceptional Point (EP) in the vicinity, as depicted with
a cross in Fig. 16. An EP is a degenerate eigenvalue defined by an alge-
braic a and geometric g multiplicity so that a > g. Such a mathematical
feature makes necessary that at EPs, not only the eigenfrequencies
but also the associated eigenmodes coalesce. This is different from
degenerate, semi-simple eigenvalues where a = g > 1, as those found in
degenerate azimuthal eigenmodes in annular combustors (a = g = 2),
where one eigenfrequency is related to two independent eigenmodes.
Mensah et al. [55], following the work of Heiss [56], highlights that
the sensitivity of an EP to a change in the value of a given parameter
is infinite, as EPs are branch-point singularities in the parameter space.
Although the sensitivity of eigenfrequencies in the vicinity of an EP is
not infinite, it is large, as shown in Sogaro et al. [57], and the reason
for the aforementioned sparsity. Such a sensitivity can be exploited

for thermoacoustic control, moreover when the EP is associated with
positive growth rates, such as that shown in Schaefer et al. [58].

Orchini et al. [30,59], as previously also done by [55], show that
an EP can be generated as one thermoacoustic mode of acoustic origin
and one of ITA origin coalesce, as illustrated here in Fig. 15 (right).
This is also discussed in Magri [60], where a representative illustration
(Fig. 7 in that work) is displayed. Orchini et al. [30] show that the
thermoacoustic mode associated with an EP shares features of ITA and
acoustic modes, as depicted in Fig. 18. All previously mentioned studies
make use of fully reflecting boundary conditions, where no acoustic
dissipation is allowed. Yong et al. [43] investigated the evolution of the
thermoacoustic map as the acoustic reflection at the inlet and/or outlet
of an axial combustor decreases to zero. It was shown that the star
structure rotates while its center, associated with the acoustic eigen-
frequency, translates to negative values of the growth rate and goes
to minus infinity as the acoustic boundaries become anechoic. It was
shown that for certain eigenfrequencies along the acoustic trajectories
belonging to the star structure, the growth rate increases as the acoustic
reflection at the outlet decreases. Similar observations were previously
made by Hoeijmakers et al. [4] and Emmert et al. [39].

Silva et al. [61] investigate the thermoacoustic behavior of an indus-
trial combustion chamber used as the core of a microturbine for power
generation. Similar to the aforementioned studies, a thermoacoustic
map is calculated around the first acoustic eigenfrequency by varying
the parameters n and τ of a generic flame response. An adjoint-based
calculation of such a thermoacoustic map was proposed to efficiently
reduce the computational costs entailed by the parametric study. It
is shown that the obtained maps exhibit traits similar to those of
academic axial combustors, as it is composed by acoustic and ITA
trajectories following similar patterns as those observed in Fig. 16.
By exploiting the surrogate models that are built from high-order,
adjoint-based perturbation theory, it is possible to efficiently calculate

approaches for solving the nonlinear eigenvalue problem must consider
an initial guess that is already sufficiently close to the eigenfrequency
of interest. Consequently, the building of thermoacoustic maps become
tedious as very small parameter intervals must be used to assure proper
convergence to all eigenfrequencies – belonging to acoustic and ITA
trajectories – within the window of interest in the complex plane. In
order to avoid this laborious procedure when computing thermoacous-
tic maps, it is of significant help to model the thermoacoustic system
of interest under a state–space framework. The works [64–68] show
that a linear eigenvalue problem results if a thermoacoustic system is
modeled under a state–space representation, even for cases with active
flames and partially reflecting boundaries. Usually, this is achieved
by the approximation of transcendental functions in the eigenvalue to
rational functions in the eigenvalue. In addition to the Padé approxi-
mant (rational function), systems governed by time delays can also be
approximated by a numerically discretized convective equation. The
state–space representation of a system makes it possible to calculate
in ‘one-shot’ all eigenfrequencies and corresponding eigenmodes accu-
rately within a window of interest in the complex plane. Note that
for building a thermoacoustic map with N parameter variations, the
solution of N (linear) eigenvalue problems is still needed.

7. Counterintuitive phenomenon: acoustic damping may destabi-
lize ITA modes

Hoeijmakers et al. [4] realized that thermoacoustic modes may be
unstable in the presence of anechoic boundary conditions. By carrying
out a simple parametric analysis on a Rijke tube, they also pointed
out that increasing the acoustic reflection at the outlet – and thereby
reducing acoustic losses – suppresses the instability. Conversely, they
discovered that a given thermoacoustic system may be destabilized
when acoustic losses are imposed. Emmert et al. [39] confirmed that
observation when investigating the thermoacoustic behavior of a pre-
mixed turbulent combustor. By means of a low-order model [taX 37],

thermoacoustic maps when accounting for (small or large) parameter
variations, also in cases of more elaborated flame response models.

All previously mentioned studies solve the nonlinear eigenvalue
problem – which results from the discretization of the Helmholtz
equation or linearized Euler equations together with the flame response
model – using iterative approaches.6 The convergence of these ap-
proaches to a specific eigenfrequency strongly depends on the basin
of attraction associated with such an eigenfrequency and the iterative
method employed. It has been shown by Mensah [62] and Mensah
et al. [63] that some eigenfrequencies, mostly belonging to ITA tra-
jectories, exhibit a very small basin of attraction. As a result, iterative

6 In this context, iterative approaches typically consist of four steps to
solve a nonlinear eigenvalue problem: 1) guessing the eigenfrequency s, (2)
replacing that value on the nonlinear terms on s, (3) solving the resulting linear
eigenvalue problem, (4) update the guess s and repeat the process.

they show that reducing the acoustic reflection at the outlet destabilizes
a thermoacoustic mode of the system. Following the μ criterion (see
Section 5.2), they show that such a thermoacoustic mode is an ITA
mode.

Silva et al. [40] investigated the noise radiated by a turbulent
combustor (same configuration as of [39]). At a given operating con-
dition, they showed that the sound pressure level (SPL) exhibits two
peaks: one at around 400 Hz associated with the quarter wave mode of
the combustion chamber and one at around 100 Hz. The latter peak,
previously also observed in the work of Weyermann [12], can only be
explained if the thermoacoustic model accounts for the ITA feedback.
It is then concluded that the peak at 100 Hz is caused by the resonance
of the ITA loop. Silva et al. [40] also show that decreasing the outlet
reflection coefficient in the model leads to two opposite outcomes:
the SPL (acoustic) peak at 400 Hz is reduced whereas the SPL (ITA)
peak at 100 Hz becomes stronger. An uncertainty quantification study
based on this configuration was carried out later by Silva et al. [69]
corroborating these observations.

A devoted experiment was carried out by Xu et al. [47], where
experimental confirmation of the aforementioned observations – made
from parametric studies with thermoacoustic models – was achieved.
In their work, Xu et al. [47] make use of an acoustic liner at the
combustion chamber walls of a premixed turbulent combustor as a
passive instability-control device, as illustrated in Fig. 19. Fig. 20 shows
that Mode 2, identified in that study as an acoustic mode, is damped
once a rigid wall is replaced by an acoustic liner. In contrast, Mode
1, identified as an ITA mode in that study, becomes stronger by the

introduction of such a passive control device. Xu et al. [47] also show
that increasing the bias flow on the liner, which enhances the acoustic
damping in the system, can transform a stable combustor into an
unstable one, where an ITA mode is destabilized. The aforementioned
results are of tremendous importance for instability control theory,
because it demonstrates that passive control devices do not always act
as mitigating elements of combustion instability: on the contrary, they
can promote it.

Yong et al. [43] showed that an eigenfrequency belonging to an
acoustic trajectory becomes unstable as acoustic losses are enhanced. At
first glance, such a result may imply that not only ITA modes but also
perturbed acoustic modes suffer from this counterintuitive pathology.
Recall however Section 5.2, where it is discussed that classifying a
thermoacoustic mode as ITA or acoustic is far from trivial. There-
fore, perturbed acoustic modes, even though they are associated with
the eigenfrequencies belonging to acoustic trajectories, may exhibit a
strong ITA nature.

It is important to highlight, as final discussion in this section, that
the Rayleigh criterion for thermoacoustic instability still applies in
cases where instability is created by enhancing acoustic losses. The
right-hand side of the acoustic energy equation, expressed as ‘sources
- losses’, must always be positive for instability to occur. It implies
that the strength of acoustic sources increases more than the acoustic
losses counterpart, when acoustic damping devices are introduced. A
corresponding cause of this observation is that, when the acoustic
damping device is placed within the system, the shape of the acoustic
mode (at least in the region close to the flame) is altered in such a way
that the acoustic pressure phase becomes more aligned with the heat
release rate counterpart. As a result, the acoustic source strength may
surpass the acoustic losses introduced by the damping device. Such a
strong change of the acoustic pressure field in the presence of acoustic
damping devices may be a route of future studies. Note that in the
theory of current works of relevance, such as Ghirardo et al. [70], it
is assumed that the acoustic mode shape remains invariant under the
presence of an acoustic damping device. Although most of the time such
assumption is correct, due to the relative small size of typical damping
devices, one should not rule out the extension of such works to cases
where the acoustic mode shape is allowed to change.

8. ITA modes in annular combustors

So far most studies on ITA modes have focused on axial combustors.
Annular combustion chambers, which are used for stationary power
generation and aircraft propulsion, are usually the core of high-power-
density gas turbines. As such, it becomes important to understand how
ITA modes manifest themselves in these annular systems. To date, two
relevant studies devoted to ITA modes in annular combustors have been
carried out [21,22].

By making use of a contour integration technique to solve the non-
linear eigenvalue problem derived from the Helmholtz equation [71],
Buschmann et al. [21] discovered the existence of groups of eigen-
frequencies in the complex plane with very similar frequencies of
oscillation. These groups, denoted as clusters, appear at regular dis-
tances on the real axis of the complex plane with frequencies closely
related to the time delay characterizing the flame response model,
as per ω = π∕τ. Therefore, they are associated with ITA modes.
Additionally, each eigenfrequency of a given cluster is associated with
one azimuthal order m of the annular system (see Fig. 21 (left) for an
illustration). The corresponding ITA modes relate to typical evanescent
modes of 2D or 3D acoustic systems, as they do not propagate in the
axial direction and their amplitudes exhibit an exponential decay, as
illustrated in Fig. 21 (right). Being evanescent, these modes do not ‘see’
the inlet and outlet acoustic boundary conditions of the system, and
are, thus, independent of them. Low-order ITA modes (small m) are not
as evanescent as high-order ITA modes (large m) and may be affected
by the acoustic boundary conditions. If that occurs, the corresponding

eigenfrequency may drift away from the cluster, as the frequency of
oscillation no longer depends exclusively on the time delay τ of the
flame response. Note that the way in which the non-linear eigenvalue
problem is solved in Buschmann et al. [21] permitted the discovery
of the aforementioned clusters. It would have hardly been possible if
iterative methods, like the fixed point algorithm, had been used (see
last discussion of Section 6).

Fournier et al. [22] proposed an alternative explanation for the
existence of the ITA clusters in annular combustors. They character-
ize an annular combustor by means of a simple 1D network model
while making use of Bloch boundary conditions [72]. Following the
model assumptions, they analytically derived the acoustic reflection
downstream of each burner. A key-message of this study, also previ-
ously given by Ghirardo et al. [73], is that the reflection coefficient
is function of the Bloch-wave number, and thereby function of the
azimuthal order m. Additionally, because the annular system is assumed
to exhibit no acoustic losses, the magnitude of the reflection coefficient
is unity for all m orders. Thus, considering an annular combustor with
N burners reduces to considering a 1D duct-flame characterized by an
outlet reflection coefficient with magnitude one and N different values
for the phase. The annular combustion system can then be thought
as N duct-flames with N different lengths. As discussed in Section 4
(see ITA trajectories in Fig. 10), a duct-flame, i.e. a Rijke tube, exhibits
eigenfrequencies at odd multiples of ω = π∕τ for infinitesimal values
of the gain. ITA trajectories, which follow quasi-vertical patterns, are
observed when the eigenfrequency loci are tracked as n increases.

Being eigenfrequencies belonging to ITA trajectories, they are not much
affected by the length of the duct but instead are strongly influenced by
the time delay of the flame response. As a result, ITA eigenfrequencies
belonging to N ducts (with different lengths) exhibit very similar
frequencies, and can thereby form clusters, as shown in Fig. 22. The
proposed model also makes it possible to understand why high-order
ITA modes are more damped than low-order ITA modes. A high (low)
value of m is represented by a short (long) duct, where the flame is
placed close to (far from) the outlet. An instability analysis – carried
out using phasors in [22] – can show that a flame close to the outlet
corresponds to a highly negative growth rate.

In a recent study, Fournier et al. [74] studied the interaction of
clusters of acoustic origin [73,75] and of ITA origin in a simpli-
fied can-annular combustor, by considering an equivalent reflection
coefficient derived in [76], which behaves similarly to that of von
Saldern et al. [75]. It is shown that the interaction between the two
aforementioned clusters is well captured by a model composed by a
set of Rijke tubes with equivalent lengths, similarly to what is done
in Fournier et al. [22]. Note that the model of [74] assumes that the
characteristic Strouhal number is sufficiently low and that amplifica-
tion of damping, caused by mean-flow effects [77,78], are negligible.
Similar to [21], Fournier et al. [22,74,76] refrain from using iterative
approaches to solve the nonlinear eigenvalue problem. Instead, they
model the thermoacoustic system via an state-space approach using
taX [37] because of its suitability when evaluating ITA eigenfrequencies
(see last discussion of Section 6).

9. The Galerkin expansion

which implies p ≈ ηkψ k. Eq. (56) reduces to

The thermoacoustic models discussed so far in the present article are
low-order models, such as acoustic networks or the quasi-1D Helmholtz
equation. When coupled with the flame response, such as that given by
Eq. (5), an ITA feedback loop emerges (see illustration in Fig. 3). It is
now of interest to know if modal truncated thermoacoustic models –
frequently used in reduced order methods – are capable of capturing
the ITA feedback loop and the associated eigenpairs. We focus on the
Galerkin expansion method.

The Galerkin expansion [6] is formulated under the classical paradigm

(see Section 1.1), where thermoacoustic modes are seen as acoustic
modes that are perturbed by the flame. Until what extent acoustic
modes are perturbed and under which circumstances they become un-
stable are the main questions that the Galerkin expansion methodology
addresses. The Galerkin expansion is usually applied to the Helmholtz
equation in its one-, two- or three-dimensional form. In this study, we
consider instead the quasi-1D Helmholtz equation, to be consistent with
the system described by Eqs. (1) and (2). Applying the spatial derivative
operator to the linearized momentum Eq. (1), the time derivative
operator to the linearized energy Eq. (2) and subtracting the resulting
expressions results in the quasi-1D Helmholtz equation

where the harmonic decomposition []′ = ̂[]est has been considered. The
Helmholtz equation (53) in absence of a source term reads

 ̂p = as2 ̂p.

(54)

Spatially discretizing the operator  in Eq. (54) results in a square
matrix L, which can be expressed in terms of a generalized eigenvalue
decomposition L = AΨ ΛΨ H A, where Ψ is a rectangular matrix whose
columns define a subset of eigenvectors ψ of L, and Λ is a diagonal
matrix with entries corresponding to a subset of the eigenvalues λ2
of L. A denotes a diagonal matrix,7 whose diagonal elements are
associated with the cross-section a at the discretization nodes location.
The superscript []H denotes the Hermitian transpose. Note that the
eigenpair (ψ k, λk = σk + iωk) corresponds to the k acoustic eigenmode
and eigenfrequency of the system characterized by Eq. (54). For sim-
plicity in the description, the matrix L is considered to be self-adjoint.
Accordingly, ideal boundary conditions (inlet and outlet being fully
reflecting) are assumed. As a result, the eigenvectors ψ are orthogonal
i Aψ j = δij , where
to each other under the inner product ⟨ψ i, ψ j ⟩
δij denotes the Kronecker delta function.

Assume now the decomposition p = ∑N

k=1 ηkψ k = Ψ η, where p is
the discretized thermoacoustic eigenvector ̂p, and η is a vector whose
entries ηk denote the weights associated with each acoustic mode ψ k.
This expression postulates that it is possible to approximate a given
thermoacoustic mode p as a linear combination of N acoustic modes
ψ. The discretized Helmholtz equation (53) now reads

≡ ψ H

s2AΨ η − AΨ ΛΨ H AΨ η = s(γ − 1)Aq,

(55)

where q denotes the spatially discretized heat release rate ̂̇q. Eq. (55) is
projected into the set of acoustic eigenvectors by left-multiplying Ψ H
to Eq. (55). It leads to

s2η − Λη = s(γ − 1)Ψ H Aq.

(56)

Under the classical paradigm, where a thermoacoustic mode is seen
as a perturbed acoustic mode, it is adequate to assume that a given
acoustic mode k contributes the most in the linear combination p = Ψ η,

9.1. The flame response

For simplicity, most studies [such as 79–81], consider the field of
heat release q is a linear function of p when relying on the Galerkin
approach. As nonlinear terms (such as ηj
k for j ∈ N) can be ad-
ditionally considered, this model is adequate for nonlinear analysis.
Only few studies have considered the inclusion of a time delay in the
model for q [8,79,82,83]. Dowling and Stow [79] assume that the
flame responds predominantly to acoustic pressure fluctuations after
a characteristic time delay τp. Such a model can be encapsulated by
q = IfI ⊺
ψ knpe−sτp . If and Iref are vectors of size
[dim(L) × 1]. The elements of If are equal to unity when corresponding
to the location of the flame. Otherwise they are zero. Note that some
normalization of If may be pertinent if more than one element is of
unity value. The elements of Iref are zero everywhere, except for one
element being unity at the reference position. Introducing this model
in Eq. (57) results in

p npe−sτp ≈ ηkIfI ⊺

where κ = ψ H
ψ k is a real number. It is positive when assuming
that no pressure node exists between the reference position and the
flame location, which is the case in most situations. As previously
discussed, Eq. (5) states that in premixed flames it is the upstream
velocity and not the pressure that is directly linked to the unsteady
heat release rate. Nevertheless, using velocity instead of pressure as
the driver of unsteady heat release does not help in the derivation of an
useful and simple expression as Eq. (58). For this reason, fluctuations of
velocity (instead of pressure) are usually not considered in the Galerkin
approach when defining q. However, it may still be possible – as pro-
posed in this review – to conceive an input that is in phase with velocity
fluctuations. This can be done by considering ∂p∕∂t as the driving
mechanism. The proposed expression reads q = −IfI ⊺
∂p∕∂t ne−sτ .
After combining it with Eq. (57), we obtain

k = −s2(γ − 1)κne−sτ .

9.2. ITA modes

(59)

It is of interest now to investigate, whether a one-mode Galerkin
expansion captures eigenfrequencies associated with ITA modes. We
consider the two scenarios discussed in Section 2.2. The first scenario
reads limn→0 |ne−sτ
| = 0. Under this limit and Eq. (58) (or Eq. (59)), it
is clear that the thermoacoustic eigenfrequency s goes to the acous-
tic eigenfrequency λk as n goes to zero. Evidently, this is scenario
is associated with the classical paradigm. The second scenario reads
limn→0 |ne−sτp | = β > 0 where β ∼ (1). Consider Eq. (59) and replace
ne−sτ by βe−iωτ . It yields

σ2 − ω2 + 2iσω + ω2

k = βκ(σ2 − ω2 + 2iσω)(γ − 1)e−iωτ ,
where λk = iωk because no acoustic losses are considered in Eq. (54)
and therefore σk = 0. As limn→0 σ → −∞, Eq. (60) reduces in this limit
to

(60)

σ2 ≈ −βκσ2(γ − 1)e−iωτ

(61)

The left-hand side of Eq. (61) is positive and real. The right-hand side
of Eq. (61) is positive and real only if e−iωτ = −1 (note that κ > 0 as
previously discussed). We conclude that ω is defined by odd multiples
of π∕τ in the limit n → 0. Note that the same limit is obtained when
applying the same analysis to Eq. (58). It is rather surprising that
a single mode Galerkin expansion captures well the frequency limit
associated to limn→0 σ → −∞, which is the one obtained when using
non-truncated thermoacoustic models (see Section 4).

non-truncated thermoacoustic models (see Section 4). The Galerkin
expansion approach reveals an additional piece of information that a
given full model, understood here as the Helmholtz equation, does not.
It shows that ωτ at the neutral curve is equal to even and odd multiples
of π for ωk > ω and ωk < ω, respectively.

Consider the BRS configuration, with parameters given in Table 1.
Figs. 23 and 24 show the eigenfrequencies obtained by solving Eqs. (58)

able that a one mode Galerkin expansion is capable of capturing both

odd multiples of π∕τ, as also observed in Gant et al. [83]. Additionally
the value of ω at the neutral axis is as stated above. Compare Fig. 24
against Fig. 10, where results come from a full model where no modal
truncation is performed. It is noteworthy that both acoustic and ITA
trajectories around ω1 given by Eq. (59) correspond very well to those
given by the full model using taX and the flame response model of
Eq. (5). Also note that the acoustic trajectory associated with the second
acoustic mode ω2 is not captured by the Galerkin expansion model. This
is natural, given the fact that only the first mode was considered in the
expansion. A more complete picture on the suitability of Eq. (59) to
model acoustic and ITA trajectories is given in Example 7.

Example 8

We study the same configuration as Example 7 and focus on the
solution of Eq. (59). We carry out the same kind of parametric analysis
discussed in Section 6 and generate a thermoacoustic map by varying

n ∈ [0, 4] and τ ∈ [0, 2π∕ω1], where ω1 = 335 rad/s is the frequency
of the first acoustic mode. Fig. 25 (left) shows the thermoacoustic map
around ω1 generated by the solution of Eq. (59). It is remarkable how
the loci patterns obtained via a full model (see Fig. 25 (right) and
Section 6), i.e. acoustic and ITA trajectories, are well recovered by the
truncated model of Eq. (59). Better agreement could be obtained when
tuning the parameter κ. For completeness, the solution of Eq. (58) is
shown in Fig. 26. It can be observed that there is no agreement with the
full model (Fig. 25 (right)). This is because the flame response model
considered in Eq. (58) is characterized by p and not uu (see Eq. (5)).

10. Practical relevance

Are ITA modes of interest in industrial real-world configurations?
Have ITA modes already been (perhaps unintentionally) observed in
existing literature? The question of practical relevance is indeed very
pertinent. Such relevance, however, can only be evaluated if the in-
stabilities observed experimentally can be unambiguously associated
with an ITA resonance, which, in turn, requires a proper definition
of ITA modes, an open question to this day (see Section 5.2). For the
present discussion, let us assume that indications for ITA resonance are:
(i) a resonance frequency ω that is not in the vicinity of an acoustic
frequency ω0 (see Fig. 14 to visualize the distance between ITA and
acoustic frequencies); (ii) a resonance frequency ω, at which the phase
of the flame response φ is evaluated to be φ(ω) = −π (see discussion
after Eq. (51)); (iii) a resonance frequency ω that strongly depends on
the characteristic time of the flame response τ and is barely affected
by changes in the geometry (see Section 5.1). For assessing points i–iii,
it is important that specific information in the related studies can be
found such as: (a) estimation of the natural frequencies ω0 of the system
(i.e. acoustic frequencies as defined in page 1 of the present work);
(b) an accurate model of the flame response; (c) effect of parametric
variation – mean flow or geometric modification – on the observed
instability. Such kind of information (points a, b and c) is scarce when
considering industrial real-world configurations.

Generally, the main goal in experimental campaigns devoted to
thermoacoustics is to identify frequency bands of concern so that con-
trol techniques, such as Helmholtz resonators or (more rarely) active
control methodologies, can be put in place. Note that such kind of
studies are of significant interest for OEMs, as the avoidance or mitiga-
tion of combustion instabilities is of the highest concern. Many related
studies aim at the theoretical characterization of such instabilities by
means of low-order modeling. Such instabilities can be described by
accounting for the linearized conservation equations (mass, momentum
and energy), and a suitable model for the flame response (which
can be empirically derived from data), or simply by decomposing the
system in a collection of subsystems, each characterized by an acoustic

technique is evaluated as suitable or not for the mitigation of the
instabilities observed. Note that such studies do not necessarily require
the information described in the aforementioned points a, b and c.

The following analysis is made after doing a careful literature
research on studies, where the above points (a, b or c) can be found.
Such studies are indeed rare, as just a handful of works address these
points.

(a) Deviation of ω and ω0: Most of the time, it is possible to state
that the observed unstable thermoacoustic mode is simply a perturbed
acoustic mode, based on the observation that ω is very close to ω0. The
deviation of ω and ω0 of several studies is summarized by Ghirardo
et al. [8], who report in Table 1 a corresponding ratio ω∕ω0. In most
cases, this ratio is close to unity. Note that the natural frequencies of
the system ω0 must be generally modeled, as the associated modes are
usually stable and cannot be easily captured experimentally. This is
perhaps one reason that explains why not many studies report values
of ω0, and consequently a deviation of ω with respect to ω0. Based
on the survey of [8] and the observation that ω∕ω0 ≈ 1, it may be
valid to claim that ITA-related instabilities are less likely to occur
than classical thermoacoustic instabilities. This is indeed suggested in
Section 5 (Example 6). As exemplified in Fig. 14, to be triggered,
ITA modes require a stronger source of acoustic energy (see triangles)
than classical thermoacoustic modes (see blue circles). As a result,
flames with moderate strength may not be able to trigger ITA-related
instabilities.

transfer function (transmission and reflection coefficients as function
of frequency) assessed experimentally. By doing so, the frequencies
observed in experiments ω can be recovered by the model, usually
by solving a dispersion relation. Subsequently, the investigated control

In contrast to the cases where ω∕ω0 is close to unity, there are
situations where the deviation of the instability frequency ω and the
acoustic counterpart ω0 is significant. For example, Noiray [84] inves-
tigates experimentally and theoretically the thermoacoustic instability
of a multi-flame combustor. In his work, particularly in Fig. 2.2 for
plate 4 (in contrast to plate 1 and plate 6), he shows that the frequency
of instability deviates more than 10% from the value of the natural
frequency of the system. No further analysis from this deviation is
presented. Boudy et al. [85] study a similar configuration. In their
work, particularly in their Fig. 5, he shows that one frequency around
600 Hz shows up in an instability that is not associated with the 1st
or 2nd acoustic modes. The same level of deviation can be observed
in a very different configuration, investigated in Bloxsidge et al. [86],
where the measured instabilities and the natural frequencies deviate
more than 10%. In the work of Nicoud [87], thermoacoustic studies of
a helicopter combustion chamber are reported, where LES results of a
self-excited instability are compared with those of a Helmholtz solver. It
is shown that the instability in LES occur at 740 Hz, whereas the acous-
tic frequency calculated by the Helmholtz solver is around 610 Hz.
Other studies, such as Tufano et al. [88], report a frequency observed
experimentally (440 Hz) that lies between two acoustic modes (240 Hz
and 710 Hz). Similarly, Harvazinski et al. [89] report an instability,
observed in numerical simulations, with a frequency (2800 Hz) lying
between the first and second longitudinal modes. They mention:‘‘This
[resonance frequency] was not seen experimentally and its source is
not clear".

As shown above, several studies have reported thermoacoustic os-
cillations occurring at frequencies moderately far from the acoustic
counterparts. In all cases, the origin of such deviations is unknown.
As a consequence, it is not clear whether the observed instabilities
can be seen as perturbed acoustic modes. Various conjectures for the
observations may arise. For example, strong nonlinear effects in the
flame response may induce a limit cycle frequency being very different
from the one predicted by linear theory [8]. Another explanation
can be related to the fact that the resonance is not related to the
excitation of the acoustic loop (see Figs. 1 and 3) but to a hydrodynamic
mode [90,91] or to a loop accounting for the convection of entropy
waves and the entropy/acoustic conversion mechanism [92]. Others,
such as [88] assume that the observed frequency may result from fluid–
structure interaction. In any case, these results may also indicate that
the ITA feedback loop plays a role in the observed frequencies and may
thus be an explanation for the deviation of ω and ω0. Therefore, it is
helpful to investigate the phase of the flame response.

(b) φ(ω) = −π: Whereas the deviation of ω and ω0 can be a first
hint of a thermoacoustic mode of ITA nature, there are other few
indications found in two of the former mentioned studies. The work of
Nicoud [87] introduces a flame response where the acoustic velocity
at a given upstream reference position is fully out of phase of the
fluctuating heat release. This phase of π, emulated by a calibrated
time delay in an n − τ model, permits the Helmholtz solver to capture
the frequency of instability observed in the LES (740 Hz). The work
of Noiray [84] discussed above also reports that the frequency of
instability is associated with a frequency, where the phase of the flame
response is close to π (Figure 7.2 and 7.3 for plate 4).

(c) Effect of parametric variation A third additional hint to eval-
uate the origin of a given observed instability is given by evaluating
the outcome of parametric studies. Hochgreb et al. [92] studies the
convection of entropy waves as a mechanism of thermoacoustic insta-
bility. Among others, they carried out experiments with two combustor
lengths. They found experimentally that the resonance frequency only
slightly changed in these two configurations. This is an unexpected
result, because such a resonance frequency is a function of the con-
vection time of entropy disturbances along the combustor, which in
turn is a function of the combustor length. They denote this result as
surprising and state: ‘‘this [measurement] cannot be easily explained

using the current simulations, and await further study". Note that the
work of [92] is similar to the one of Murugesan et al. [48], who some
years later observed in their investigation that changing the length
of the combustion chamber did not influence the frequency of the
observed instability. Instead, such a frequency was strongly dependent
on characteristic times of the flame response, a strong indication for the
role of the ITA feedback loop in the aforementioned instabilities. If the
work of Eckstein et al. [10] is also considered (see introduction), it can
be argued that ITA related instabilities can be one origin of ‘rumble’, a
low-frequency instability commonly found in aeroengines.

The work of Laurent et al. [93] relies purely on numerical sim-
ulations. They studied the thermoacoustic behavior of a helicopter
combustion chamber by means of a low-order model based on a frame
of basis functions and a state-space approach. They observed that the
growth rate of one of the computed eigenfrequencies of the studied
combustion chamber increases as the outlet reflection coefficient (adja-
cent to the high pressure turbine stage) decreases, an outcome similar
to that of [47] obtained experimentally. Laurent et al. [93] mention
that such a result may be caused by the nature of the eigenfrequency,
which may be ITA related.

In the introduction of this manuscript, Section 1.2 summarized other
cases of interest – Eckstein et al. [10], Weyermann [12] and Tay-
Wo-Chong et al. [13] – that revealed unexpected outcomes without
a unified explanation. In those cases the information of type (a, b
and c) was available. With the current tools of ITA classification,
mostly based on what it is referred to here as ‘‘Essential Features of
ITA modes" (Section 5.1), it has already been shown that the modes
observed in the three aforementioned studies are of ITA nature. Ghani
et al. [94] demonstrate in their paper that the instability observed
in Eckstein et al. [10] exhibits essential features of the ITA feedback
loop – such as scaling of resonance frequency with time delay τ –
and therefore it is concluded it should be an ITA instability. The work
of Silva et al. [40] focuses on the same case study carried out by
Weyermann [12]. By introducing the ITA feedback in the model of
combustion noise, it is shown that a peak at 100 Hz is recovered. The
frequency of such a peak is directly linked to the frequency of the ITA
feedback-loop present in the system. Emmert et al. [39] and Albayrak
et al. [36] study the same configuration as in Tay-Wo-Chong et al. [13]
for several combustor powers. They demonstrate that there are several
ITA-related eigenfrequencies, some of them with non-negligible growth
rates. Emmert et al. [39] use the μ criterion for the classification
(Section 5.2.1), whereas Albayrak et al. [36] use the ‘‘Essential Features
of ITA modes" ideas introduced in Section 5.1. It should be highlighted
that data containing the information of the aforementioned points (a,
b and c) is of high value for root-cause-analysis, and the assessment of
the importance of the ITA feedback loop in real world configurations.
Note that the understanding of acoustic pulsations during experimental
campaigns is mostly subjected to a pool of possible causes – such as
traditional thermoacoustic modes, entropy or hydrodynamic modes –
that compose the classical understanding of thermoacoustic combustion
instabilities. It is therefore essential to be aware of the existence of
another mechanism (ITA feedback loop) that may be of relevance and
possibly the explanation of already observed acoustic pulsations in
experimental campaigns.

Another effect of practical relevance of ITA-related eigenfrequen-
cies is their role in the resonance of externally forced combustors,
in experimental or simulation campaigns when evaluating the flame
response. In order to enlarge the region of operation at which the flame
response can be measured, damping devices are generally added to the
system (i.e. acoustic orifice(s)) to ensure stable regimes. Note that it
is usually believed that the inlet/outlet of the combustor should be
as non-reflective as possible in order to avoid the resonance of acous-
tic modes and, thus, the triggering of nonlinearities (high amplitude
fluctuations) or thermoacoustic instabilities. In view of the recently
acquired knowledge, it should be clear that eliminating the acoustic

reflection at certain boundaries of the system does not completely
eliminate resonance effects. In contrast, such resonance effects may be
promoted if they are associated with the ITA feedback loop. Fig. 27
shows the Power Spectral Density of a velocity time series obtained
by LES of a thermoacoustically stable combustor [13]. Such a time
series is used as input signal for system identification. A pronounced
peak around 100 Hz is evident, which is solely related to an ITA
eigenfrequency and not associated with any acoustic mode. Whereas
in the work of [13], such a high energy content at one frequency
in the input (and output signal) is not too detrimental for obtaining
satisfactory results, it may not be the case in other studies. The effect
of the ITA resonance on systems that are externally forced has not been
reported in the literature so far. In view of its effects on the quality of
flame response evaluation, which is a decisive task in thermoacoustic
studies, it should be considered in future works on the topic.

11. Conclusions and perspectives

The formal recognition of the existence of thermoacoustic modes
not directly linked to acoustic modes opens new horizons in thermoa-
coustics. The classical paradigm, which regards thermoacoustic modes
as perturbed acoustic modes, should be generalized to include intrinsic
thermoacoustic (ITA) modes.

As shown in this review, the complete set of solutions of classi-
cal thermoacoustic models – such as acoustic networks or low-order
descriptions (i.e. Helmholtz Equation), where an acoustic model is
coupled with a given flame response – includes ITA eigenpairs. Nev-
ertheless, this kind of (ITA) solutions was not discovered until very
recently, mainly because the conceptual background was missing and
the calculation strategies were not holistic. Accordingly, experimental
observations that did not fit the classical paradigm were explained
with ad hoc models, as in [11,12], or simply left for future studies, as
in [88,92]. Most works in thermoacoustics considered iterative methods
for the solution of the nonlinear eigenvalue problem, such as the
fixed point algorithm [5]. Iterative methods require an initial guess,
which most of the time was taken as the acoustic eigenfrequency lying
within a given frequency band of interest. Such a calculation strategy
was fueled by the thermoacoustic understanding offered by the clas-
sical paradigm. As a result, perturbed acoustic eigenfrequencies were
generally obtained as solution of the thermoacoustic problem. Such
kind of results was additionally benefited by the basin of attraction
of perturbed acoustic modes, which seems to be predominantly large
if compared with the ITA counterpart [see 62,63]. One calculation
strategy that outperforms iterative methods consists in expressing the

thermoacoustic problem under a state-space framework [64,66–68,93].
The resulting eigenvalue problem is linear, which allows a direct com-
putation of all eigenfrequencies and corresponding eigenmodes, i.e. the
spectrum of the system, within a window of interest. Note that taX,
the software used for this article, is based on a state-space approach.
Another calculation strategy was recently introduced by [71], which
makes use of contour integration in the complex eigenvalue plane [95].
It allows for the calculation of all eigenfrequencies of interest within a
predefined region in the complex plane. Note that such a method was
essential for the calculation of the eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes of
an annular combustion chamber, where cluster of ITA eigenfrequen-
cies were observed for the first time [21]. It seems that non-iterative
methods will be of crucial importance for thermoacoustic instability
investigation, not only in academic systems but also in complex con-
figurations, such as annular or can-annular combustion chambers of
industrial gas turbines, where thermoacoustic modes, which appear in
clusters and are not necessarily associated with acoustic modes, may
become unstable.

The possibility of calculating the spectrum of a given system without
much difficulty provided the opportunity of carrying out parametric
analysis on the spectrum, which permitted the identification of clear
patterns in the loci of a given thermoacoustic system when two pa-
rameters (n and τ) of a generic flame response were systematically
varied (see Section 6). Such kinds of study allowed the identification
of acoustic trajectories, associated with perturbed acoustic modes, and
ITA trajectories. Several studies have evaluated the asymptotic limits
of thermoacoustic eigenfrequencies of a Rijke tube when n goes to
zero and also their values at the neutral curve in the complex plane,
when the growth rate is zero. This review article encapsulates these
formulations in a single analysis and generalizes them to the case of
three co-axial ducts, a generic configuration omnipresent in combustion
studies (see Sections 3 and 4). The aforementioned thermoacoustic
maps have also permitted the identification of thermoacoustic similar-
ity in family of combustors (see Figs. 16 and 17) and the existence of
Exceptional Points (EPs) in the thermoacoustic spectrum. Future studies
investigating thermoacoustic maps and their features should bring their
attention to cases with acoustic dissipation through boundaries or sinks
(see section 4.4). Expecting a mere downward translation of these maps
(towards smaller values of growth rate) may not be correct, as already
observed in a particular case of incremental dissipation of an outlet
boundary [43].

This review collects the different strategies found in the literature
to this day that are devoted to classifying a given thermoacoustic
mode as of acoustic or ITA nature (see Section 5). It shows that

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience95(2023)10106524

C.F. Silva

all classification methods proposed so far, except that suggested by
Yong et al. [20], are based on parametric analyses. It is shown that
these techniques sometimes offer contradictory results (see Fig. 13).
The work of [20] is specially highlighted in this article because it
offers a classification based on the thermoacoustic mode structure in
the vicinity of the flame and does not rely on parametric analysis.
As such, it may become of enormous help for thermoacoustic mode
categorization when parameter sweeps are impractical, as may hap-
pen in experiments. A generalization of this method from neutrally
stable modes to stable/unstable modes, as recently proposed by Yong
et al. [52], and to systems exhibiting acoustic dissipation would enrich
the utility of this classification technique.

The classification of a given thermoacoustic mode as of acoustic or
ITA nature may be of high importance during combustion instability
investigation. As shown in the present review, several studies have
shown that stabilization techniques that work very well in thermoa-
coustic modes with a strong acoustic nature may not be as efficient and
can even be detrimental for the stability of thermoacoustic modes with
a strong ITA nature (see Section 7). Future studies should pay attention
to the peculiar behavior of these modes and study proper means for
their stabilization, including active control – as recently investigated
by [96] on an academic configuration – and passive control.

The appearance of thermoacoustic modes of ITA nature in annular
combustors have been the matter of investigation of two recent studies
(see Section 8). These studies show that they appear in clusters and
are associated with the azimuthal orders m of the annular combustor.
The work of [22] shows that it is possible to decompose an annular
combustor into Rijke tubes of different lengths and fully reflecting
acoustic boundaries for the understanding and calculation of these ITA
clusters. Following the ideas of [74], future studies should exploit this
modeling technique, while generalizing it to account for interaction of
ITA clusters with acoustic azimuthal modes in annular and can-annular
combustors. Such a generalization may require a better understanding
of ITA modes in Rijke tubes subjected to non-fully reflecting acoustic
boundaries in order to account for acoustic dissipation.

This review article also shows that a Galerkin expansion truncated
to one mode, which results in a very simple algebraic expression
(see Eq. (59)), is able to model with astonishing accuracy the ther-
moacoustic map around the first acoustic mode of the system under
investigation (see Fig. 25). Although not shown in this study, a similar
quality of results is obtained when considering the thermoacoustic
spectrum around the second or third acoustic mode. Future studies may
consider the modeling of higher-order truncated expressions, so that
the correct representation of the thermoacoustic spectrum over a wider
area in the complex plane (including several acoustic modes) becomes
possible. Such an accomplishment would permit the development of
very economical reduced-order models for thermoacoustic design.

Most studies in intrinsic thermoacoustics have been performed on
fully premixed flames. This is because the acoustic response of such
flames can be clearly associated with one input: the velocity of the
flow at a reference location upstream of the flame. By doing so, the ITA
feedback loop (see Fig. 3) is identified. Future studies on ITA instability
should pay more attention to partially premixed and spray flames. This
remains challenging because the flame response in those cases may not
depend exclusively on one input (upstream velocity perturbations) but
also on other inputs such as equivalence ratio or pressure fluctuations
(in partially premixed flames) and on additional mechanisms such as
spray break-up, droplet transport and evaporation (in spray flames).
It is then expected that more than one ITA feedback loop (each loop
associated with a given input mechanism) shows up in the modeling
and manifests in experiments. Note that for a feedback loop to be
considered ‘intrinsic’, it is necessary that the upstream wave produced
by the flame directly affects the quantity to which the flame responds.
For example, Gopalakrishnan et al. [97] recently proposed a model
to investigate an intrinsic instability in autoignition flames, which are

characteristic of sequential combustors. Such an intrinsic feedback loop
is provoked by the direct effect of the upstream propagating acoustic
wave – produced by the autoignition flame – on the flow properties
of the vitiated mixture, which in turn affects the flame position and
heat release rate. Understanding how such an intrinsic loop affects the
overall stability of the gas turbine is undeniably of interest for the
design of stable reheat engines.

To the knowledge of the author, only one study to date has inves-
tigated limit cycles originating from the ITA feedback loop. In their
study, Mohan and Mariappan [98] take advantage of the strong link be-
tween the observed limit cycle oscillations and the (non-linear) acoustic
flame response, while assuming that the acoustic environment does not
play a big role in the amplitude and frequency of these oscillations.
Accordingly, they are able to capture the amplitude and frequency of
the investigated limit cycle by a simple analytical expression. Future
studies on ITA instability can continue the effort of understanding how
limit cycles and the ITA feedback loop are related. They should exploit
the rather simple dispersion relation that describes the ITA feedback
loop (See Eq. (26) for anechoic boundaries) to introduce nonlinear
models in the flame dynamics and study the associated limit cycles.
Note that these oscillations may be complex in nature – producing
period-k, quasiperiodic, or chaotic oscillations – in case of nonlinear
modal interaction with other (unstable) thermoacoustic modes of ITA
or acoustic origin.
