High-pressure thermodynamics 

Rocket engines and high-power new generations of gas-turbine jet engines and diesel engines often- 
times involve the injection of one or more reactants at subcritical temperatures into combustor envi- 
ronments at high pressures, and more particularly at pressures higher than those corresponding to the 
critical points of the individual components of the mixture, which typically range from 13 to 50 bars for 
most propellants. This class of trajectories in the thermodynamic space has been traditionally referred to 
as transcritical. However, the fundamental understanding of fuel atomization, vaporization, mixing, and 
combustion processes at such high pressures remains elusive. In particular, whereas fuel sprays are rela- 
tively well characterized at normal pressures, analyses of dispersion of fuel in high-pressure combustors 
are hindered by the limited experimental diagnostics and theoretical formulations available. The descrip- 
tion of the thermodynamics of hydrocarbon-fueled mixtures employed in chemical propulsion systems is 
complex and involves mixing-induced phenomena, including an elevation of the critical point whereby 
the coexistence region of the mixture extends up to pressures much larger than the critical pressures of 
the individual components. As a result, interfaces subject to surface-tension forces may persist in multi- 
component systems despite the high pressures, and may give rise to unexpected spray-like atomization 
dynamics that are otherwise absent in monocomponent systems above their critical point. In this arti- 
cle, the current understanding of this phenomenon is reviewed within the context of propulsion systems 
fueled by heavy hydrocarbons. Emphasis is made on analytical descriptions at mesoscopic scales of inter- 
est for computational ﬂuid dynamics. In particular, a set of modiﬁcations of the constitutive laws in the 
Navier–Stokes equations for multicomponent ﬂows, supplemented with a high-pressure equation of state 
and appropriate redeﬁnitions of the thermodynamic potentials, are introduced in this work based on an 
extended version of the diffuse-interface theory of van der Waals. The resulting formulation involves re- 
visited forms of the stress tensor and transport ﬂuxes of heat and species, and enables a description 
of the mesoscopic volumetric effects induced by transcritical interfaces consistently with the thermody- 
namic phase diagram of the mixture at high pressures. Applications of the theory are illustrated in canon- 
ical problems, including dodecane/nitrogen transcritical interfaces in non-isothermal systems. The results 
indicate that a transcritical interface is formed between the propellant streams that persists downstream 
of the injection oriﬁce over distances of the same order as the characteristic thermal-entrance length 
of the fuel stream. The transcritical interface vanishes at an edge that gives rise to a fully supercritical 
mixing layer.

1. Introduction 

The utilization of high pressures for burning fuel and oxidizer 
is a necessary requirement for the generation of thrust in chemical 
propulsion systems for ground, air, and space engineering applica- 
tions. In modern designs, the characteristic pressures in the com- 
bustor range from 40 to 560 bars in rocket engines, to 20–60 bars 
in gas-turbine jet engines at takeoff, and 10–30 bars in diesel en- 
gines. However, great diﬃculties arise when attempting to model 
the dynamics of chemically reacting ﬂows at high pressures. One 
of them, which inﬂuences the dispersion of fuel in the combus- 
tor and represents the focus of the present work, is related to the 
occurrence of transcritical conditions. 

Challenges  associated  with  transcritical  conditions  have  been 
known  since  the  development  of  high-pressure  thrust  chambers 
for liquid-fueled rocket engines [1–4] . A number of controlled ex- 
periments have been undertaken over the years to study ﬂows at 
high  pressures  [5–14] ,  and  many  have  revealed  the  presence  of 
interfaces separating the propellants [15–23] . The high pressures, 
however,  limit  the  amount  of  information  that  can  be  obtained 
from  state-of-the-art  experimental  diagnostics.  Numerical  simu- 
lations  have  accompanied  these  endeavors  [24–31] ,  but  most  of 
these computations have been limited to high-pressure conditions 
that did not warrant the existence of interfaces. Major reviews in 
the ﬁeld have also focused on those conditions [32–34] . The ﬁeld 
has evolved rapidly in recent years spurred by a number of publi- 
cations, including (a) the thermodynamic analysis of Qiu and Reitz 
[35] , which has provided detailed information about the thermo- 
dynamic space transited by homogeneous hydrocarbon-fueled mix- 
tures at high pressures; (b) the molecular-dynamics simulations by 
Mo and Qiao [36] , which have described the structure of transcrit- 
ical interfaces albeit limited to very small length and time scales 
imposed  by  the  high  computational  cost  of  molecular  methods; 
and (c) the continuum-level theoretical work of Dahms and Oe- 
felein [37] , and Gaillard et al. [38,39] , which have provided insight 
into the problem of transcriticality by using the diffuse-interface 
theory of van der Waals. The work by Dahms and Oefelein [37] was 
limited to the analysis of mean thermodynamic states in the com- 
bustor and stationary interfaces in absence of ﬂow effects. In con- 
trast, Gaillard et al. [38,39] made signiﬁcant progress in coupling 
extensions of the diffuse-interface theory of van der Waals with 
the Navier-Stokes equations to describe, for instance, steady coun- 
terﬂow hydrogen diffusion ﬂames in transcritical conditions. 

This review article shows that ﬂuid-mechanical effects are cen- 
tral  to  the  description  of  transcritical  phenomena,  and  that  the 
problem cannot be treated solely by mean thermodynamic states 
in the combustor or isolated stationary interfaces, as previously at- 
tempted [37] . This review article fulﬁlls the following objectives: 

(a)  it  summarizes  relevant  operating  conditions  leading  to  tran- 
scriticality; (b) it describes the state-of-the-art in the theoretical 
and computational understanding of transcritical interfaces at the 
continuum level; (c) it provides a comprehensive diffuse-interface 
theory of the hydrodynamics of propellants under transcritical con- 
ditions;  and  (d)  it  employs  that  theory  to  describe,  for  the  ﬁrst 
time, the downstream evolution of a transcritical interface sepa- 
rating the propellant streams. This review article also provides an 
analysis of the terminal structure of the transcritical interface at 
an edge located at a supercriticalization distance downstream of 
the oriﬁce that is calculated as part of the solution. The diffusional 
critical point of the mixture of the propellants is shown to play a 
crucial role in the description of the interface edge. Downstream 
of the interface edge, the ﬂow becomes fully supercritical, the in- 
terface disappears, and the propellants mix by molecular diffusion 
across a growing compositional mixing layer. 

1.1. Transcritical conditions in combustors fueled by heavy 
hydrocarbons 

Although  there  may  be  several  deﬁnitions  of  the  char- 
acter  of  transcritical  conditions  in  the  literature  [1–4,6,7,9–
14,19,22,24,25,30,32,33,35–37] ,  one  that  is  of  practical  relevance 
for  chemical  propulsion  systems  corresponds  to  the  thermody- 
namic conditions attained in the injection conﬁguration sketched 
in  Fig.  1 .  There,  two  streams  of  different  propellants,  denoted 
by the subindexes F (for the fuel stream) and O (for the coﬂow 
stream), are injected in such a way that the temperature of the 
coﬂow stream T 
F . In this 
conﬁguration, transcriticality is attained when at least one of the 
propellant streams, often the fuel stream in practical applications, 
enters the combustor at a subcritical temperature, but the com- 
bustor pressure P ∞ is larger than the critical pressures of the two 
separate components, denoted here by P 

O is higher than that of the fuel stream T 

c ,F and P 

c ,O . 

The  conﬁguration  depicted  in  Fig.  1  drives  the  discussion 
throughout  the  remainder  of  this  manuscript.  It  is  shown  in 
Section 7 that the main characteristics of the ﬂow ﬁeld sketched 
in Fig. 1 , including the interface separating the propellant streams, 
can  be  described  by  the  diffuse-interface  theory  presented  in 
Sections 4 and 5 even in a simpler canonical conﬁguration where 
complex but inessential factors such as turbulence, shear, and in- 
terface  corrugation  are  not  considered.  This  section  provides  a 
qualitative summary of the main physical processes and the asso- 
ciated characteristic scales. 

The possible number of combinations of thermodynamic condi- 
tions in the propellant streams that may lead to transcritical phe- 
nomena are large and cannot be addressed in a single study. Their 
particularities depend on the propulsion system and the mixture

of propellants considered, as discussed in Sections 2 and 3 . How- 
ever, the transcritical conditions illustrated in Fig. 1 are of general 
relevance in combustors fueled by heavy hydrocarbons because of 
two factors: 

(a) As observed in Table 1 , heavy hydrocarbons have relatively high 
critical temperatures, and therefore require signiﬁcant temper- 
ature increments of order unity relative to their injection tem- 
perature to become fully supercritical, namely 
T c, F − T F 
T F 

= O (1) .

Under  the  aforementioned  transcritical  conditions,  which  are 
often found in practice as discussed in Section 2 , and despite the 
prevailing high pressures, the ﬂow ﬁeld contains a region immedi- 
ately downstream of the injector oriﬁce where a thin transcritical 
interface is formed between the fuel and coﬂow streams because 
of diffusion processes essential to the mixing that necessarily pre- 
cedes combustion. Speciﬁcally, as described in Section 5 , the the- 
ory presented here indicates that surface tension survives the high 
pressures because of the intrinsic diffusional instability of the ﬂuid 
resulting from mixing the two propellant streams. This diffusional 
instability, whose basic foundations are discussed in Appendix A , 
leads to separation of the propellants by a transcritical interface 
that bears large composition gradients across and is accompanied 
by surface tension. 

Both  thermal  and  compositional  mixing  layers  sketched  in 

Fig. 1 are slender, since the characteristic Reynolds number 
Re F = ρF U F R F /ηF 
is typically much larger than unity in practical applications. In Eq. 
F  are the velocity, density, and dynamic viscos- 
(2) , U 
ity of the fuel stream, respectively, and R 
F is the fuel oriﬁce radius, 
which is typically of order 0.1–1 mm in chemical propulsion sys- 
tems of interest [19,43–45] .

In the model problem depicted in Fig. 1 , the coﬂow tempera- 
O is large enough to heat up the fuel to its critical temper- 
ture T 
ature downstream of the injection oriﬁce. For coﬂows comprised 
O  must 
of  N 
2 ,  or  air,  the  prevailing  condition  implies  that  T 
O > T 
be  larger  than  the  critical  temperature  of  the  coﬂow,  T 
c ,O , 
c ,O ∼ 120–150 K is in the range of cryogenic temperatures 
since T

perature difference between the propellant streams, deﬁned as the 
thermal-expansion ratio 

α = 

T O − T F

is  an  order-unity  parameter.  Additionally,  the  coﬂow  is  cooled 
down  by  the  fuel  stream  and,  to  a  much  lesser  extent,  the  fuel 
stream is heated by the coﬂow. This discrepancy is driven by the 
much  higher  thermal  diffusivity  of  the  coﬂow.  The  thickness  of 
the resulting thermal mixing layer, δ
T , grows with distance down- 
F near the oriﬁce (a good 
stream from small values compared to R 
assumption for thin oriﬁce rings), to values of order R 
F  far from 
the oriﬁce where the interface vanishes. Since the Prandtl num- 
ber remains close to that of air at normal conditions, only δ
T may 
be considered, for simplicity, as the length scale representative of 
both momentum and thermal transport. 

The transcritical interface extends from the oriﬁce ring to an 
edge  at  a  supercriticalization  distance  x = L TR ,  where  the  fuel 
stream has been heated up to a supercriticalization temperature 
T = T TR . The latter depends on the combination of propellants and 
is a solution of the thermodynamic phase diagram of the mixture. 
For mixtures of heavy hydrocarbons with N 
2 , or air, it will be 
shown that

The transcritical interface terminates at an edge crossed by the 
supercriticalization isotherm, where a fundamental change in the 
diffusional characteristics of the mixture occurs. The structure of 
the edge can be previewed in terms of spatial contours of the fuel 
mass fraction Y 
26 injected 
F in Fig. 2 for a system consisting of C 
2 stream at T O = 10 0 0 K. The sys- 
at T F = 450 K into a coﬂowing N 
tem is at P ∞ = 100 bar, which represents a supercritical pressure 
with respect to both components. The resulting distribution of sur- 
face tension along the transcritical interface with distance down- 
stream of the injection oriﬁce is shown in Fig. 3 . The results in 
both of those ﬁgures are obtained by using the diffuse-interface 
theory  presented  in  Sections  4  and  5 .  The  resulting  formulation 
describes high-pressure ﬂows with interfaces whose strength can 
vary in space and vanish altogether. The results obtained by using 
this theory indicate that the interface thickness δ
I  remains small 
along a large portion of the interface despite the high pressures 
involved. Consequently, the integration of the formulation is hin- 
dered by the large disparity between the interface thickness δ
I and 
other length scales, including δ
TR , and the interface radius of 
curvature R 
I . In particular, it will be shown, in conditions of prac- 
tical relevance, that the large-scale Cahn number

T , R 

F , L 

(9) 

are both much smaller than unity in the transcritical region, where 
the  interface  survives.  These  represent  fundamental  characteris- 
tics that simplify the theoretical description of the interface struc- 
ture. Further details and additional explanations of the results in 
Figs. 2 and 3 are deferred to Section 7 . 
In  the  transcritical  region  0 < x < L 

TR ,  the  interface  survives 
along with the surface-tension force it engenders. In general, the 
quantiﬁcation of L 
TR requires numerical integration of the diffuse- 
interface formulation presented here. In laminar ﬂows at moder- 
ately large values of the Reynolds number (2) , an estimate of L 
TR 
can be obtained by an integral balance between the streamwise 
variation  of  the  enthalpy  ﬂux  in  the  fuel  stream  and  the  total 
amount of heat conduction received across the interface from the

Fig. 2.  Numerical results of the present theory showing a zoomed view of the terminal structure of a transcritical interface at an edge. The interface separates two planar 
laminar streams at high Péclet numbers: one of dodecane (C 12 H 26 ) injected at T F = 450 K (below the interface), and one of molecular nitrogen (N 2 ) injected at T O = 10 0 0 K 
(above the interface). The system is at a supercritical pressure P ∞ = 100 bar with respect to both components. The ﬁgure shows the fuel mass fraction Y F (solid contours 
and dark thin dashed lines), temperature (colored thick dashed-line contours), diffusional critical point (purple diamond symbol), and diffusional spinodal (thick purple 
dashed lines). The vertical axis is the transversal distance from the jet axis y normalized with the oriﬁce radius R F , whereas the horizontal axis is the streamwise distance x 
normalized with the estimate (13) for the supercriticalization length. The ﬂow attains fully supercritical conditions downstream of the interface edge. There, both propellants 
resemble gas-like supercritical ﬂuids and mix by molecular diffusion across a compositional mixing layer that emanates from the interface edge. Details about the calculations 
are provided in Section 7 . (For interpretation of the references to color in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

laminar  jets  are  known  to  have  much  longer  thermal-entrance 
lengths  than  their  round  counterparts  because  the  outer  region, 
where  streamwise  convection  and  transverse  diffusion  balance, 
grows indeﬁnitely with the square root of x , thereby yielding com- 
paratively  smaller  heat  ﬂuxes  into  the  cold  stream  [49] .  In  this 
case,  a  more  appropriate  approximation  to  utilize  in  Eq.  (11)  is

The estimates (12) or (13) predict that the supercriticalization

The considerations above suggest that the injection oriﬁce ra- 
F has a decisive inﬂuence on the size of the transcritical re- 
dius R 
TR is a fraction of the thermal-entrance length, 
gion. In practice, L

perature T

stream. However, it will be shown that the transfer of heat from 
the coﬂow to the fuel stream is hindered in transcritical conditions 
because of two factors: 

O  (rather than T 

(a) High pressures lead to small values of the thermal diffusivity in 

the coﬂow stream. 

(b) For  a  signiﬁcant  portion  of  the  interface  length,  the  speciﬁc 
heat attains a global maximum in the vicinity of the interface, 
thereby  leading to  a  decrease in  the  local  thermal  diffusivity 
there. 

These  factors  should  be  taken  into  account  when  interpret- 
ing molecular-dynamics simulations of transcritical systems, since 
those techniques are typically limited to microscopic length scales 
that may be too small compared to the supercriticalization length 
required  to  describe  the  macroscopic  evolution  of  the  interface 
with distance downstream of the injection oriﬁce.

Additional complexities arise in realistic scenarios that are be- 
yond the scope of this study. For instance, in turbulent transcriti- 
cal ﬂows at large values of the Reynolds number (2) , the molecular 
T,O in Eq. (12) should be replaced by a turbu- 
thermal diffusivity D 
lent eddy diffusivity of order D 
T,O 
F (cid:10) 1. Consequently, the ratio of the super- 
by a factor of order Re 
criticalization length to the oriﬁce radius decreases from L TR /R F ∼
Re F R in laminar ﬂows to L TR /R F ∼ R in turbulent ﬂows. There is 
however little work to date that have addressed closures in high- 
pressure turbulent ﬂows [50] , and therefore the effects of turbu- 
lence  will  not  be  further  pursued  here.  Similarly,  hydrodynamic 
instabilities may develop as a result of the competition between 
aerodynamic  stresses  and  the  interface-restoring  surface-tension 
force in the transcritical region. These force imbalances may roll 
the interface leading to a ﬁnite local radius of interface curvature 
R 
I , and eventually to the formation of ligaments and droplets, as 
sketched in Fig. 1 . Conﬁgurations different from that in Fig. 1 may 
therefore  exist  in  which  the  supercriticalization  isotherm  never 
crosses the interface before it breaks up, but instead crosses the 
ensuing fuel spray cloud. 

1.2. Objectives and outline of the present review 

This review focuses on theoretical aspects of transcritical phe- 
nomena at a continuum level and in a manner amenable to com- 
putational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD). The key question to be explored is 
whether transcritical systems can be computed by integrating the 
Navier-Stokes equations uniformly over the entire ﬂow ﬁeld while 
subject to high-pressure equations of state along with the standard 
transport  theory  for  multicomponent  mixtures.  The  key  concern 
that impedes that approach is related to the antidiffusive character 
of  the  mass transport predicted by  the  standard theory  in  tran- 
scritical  conditions,  which  renders  the  problem  ill-posed.  To  ad- 
dress that, a formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations with revis- 
ited constitutive laws, supplemented with (a) proper redeﬁnitions 
of thermodynamic potentials, (b) a high-pressure equation of state, 
and (c) high-pressure thermophysical and multicomponent trans- 
port properties, is introduced that regularizes the problem and en- 
ables the description of volumetric effects of transcritical interfaces 
in multicomponent ﬂows. The formulation is based on extensions 
of the diffuse-interface theory of van der Waals [108] – a useful 
formalism originally designed for monocomponent isothermal sys- 
tems at high pressures, when the interface broadens signiﬁcantly 
relative to intermolecular distances. 

8 

The theory outlined here provides a description of the struc- 
ture of stationary transcritical interfaces in equilibrium, as well as 
the  downstream  evolution  of  non-equilibrium  transcritical  inter- 
faces separating propellant streams with different tem peratures. In 
the latter case, this theory predicts that the interface ends at an 
edge, whose structure elicits the central role played by the diffu- 
sional critical point of the mixture in supercriticalizing the system, 
as  shown  in  Fig.  2 .  Emphasis  is  made  on  transcritical  interfaces 
in C 
2 mixtures, but supplementary thermodynamic analy- 
ses are provided for several other mixtures of interest that iden- 
tify pressure and temperature conditions inducing transcritical in- 
terfaces in the ﬂow ﬁeld. A discussion is also included about op- 
erating conditions in combustors of aerospace propulsion systems 
leading to transcriticality.

The  remainder  of  this  manuscript  is  structured  as  follows. 
A  qualitative  description  of  transcritical  phenomena  is  pro- 
vided  in  Section  2  for  monocomponent  and  bicomponent  sys- 
tems,  along  with  a  short  survey  of  characteristic  injection  con- 
ditions  in  aerospace  propulsion  systems.  Phase  diagrams  for 
hydrocarbon-fueled  binary  mixtures  are  discussed  in  Section  3 . 
Using  the  diffuse-interface  theory,  a  formulation  of  the  Navier- 
Stokes equations that incorporates high-pressure effects and vol- 
umetric  terms  representing  embedded  interfaces  is  outlined  in 
Section  4 .  Entropy-based  closures  of  interface-related  terms  in 
the augmented Navier-Stokes equations, which enable the descrip- 
tion  of  the  structure  of  transcritical  interfaces,  are  derived  in 
Section 5 . Readers who are not interested in the development of 
the formulation can skip Sections 4 and 5 and move directly to 
Sections  6  and  7 ,  in  which  calculations  of  simpliﬁed  canonical 
problems are provided. In Section 6 , transcritical interfaces in equi- 
librium isothermal systems are analyzed. Section 7 is devoted to 
non-equilibrium transcritical interfaces in non-isothermal systems 
and their evolution downstream of the injection oriﬁce. Lastly, con- 
cluding remarks are given in Section 8 . Additionally, seven appen- 
dices are included that contain supplementary details and funda- 
mental concepts closely connected with the formulation. In partic- 
ular, Appendix A reviews basic concepts of thermodynamic stabil- 
ity and phase equilibrium. Appendix B provides a description of 
thermophysical properties and transport coeﬃcients at high pres- 
sures. Appendix C outlines supplementary thermodynamic expres- 
sions for systems at high pressures. Appendix D focuses on numer- 
ical results obtained for near-critical interfaces in monocomponent 
systems.  Appendix  E  discusses  the  behavior  of  the  present  the- 
ory near mechanically unstable conditions. Appendix F lists sup- 
plementary expressions for transport coeﬃcients at high pressures, 
and Appendix G provides methods for the numerical integration of 
the formulation presented here. 

2. High-pressure transcritical ﬂow phenomena 

A  signiﬁcant  challenge  for  the  predictive  calculation  of  tran- 
scritical  ﬂows  lies  in  the  complexity  of  the  transitional  and 
composition-dependent  character  of  the  interface  formation  and 
breakup, and of the subsequent dispersion and mixing of fuel in 
the  combustor.  To  address  these  aspects,  this  section  begins  by 
introducing the main problems associated with transcriticality in 
monocomponent ﬂows, followed by a description of more complex 
phenomena in bicomponent ﬂows. In addition, a survey of charac- 
teristic injection conditions in aerospace chemical propulsion sys- 
tems is provided at the end of this section that serves to familiar- 
ize the reader with practical conﬁgurations. 

2.1. Transcriticality in monocomponent systems 

Consider a closed vessel ﬁlled with a monocomponent liquid in 
phase equilibrium with its own vapor. The pressure and temper-

ature in the vessel are denoted by P and T , respectively. At nor- 
mal pressure, the liquid and vapor are separated by an interface 
whose thickness is clearly not in the continuum range, and which 
is subject to a surface-tension force. Below the critical pressure P c , 
the presence of such interface is warranted since each thermody- 
namic state ( P , T ) is associated with two densities [51] correspond- 
ing to the phase-equilibrium values for vapor, ρg 
e , and liquid, ρ(cid:2) 
e . 
This is illustrated in the P − v thermodynamic phase diagram in 
Fig. 4 for N 
2  is 
the molecular weight. The resulting ratio of densities of the phases, 
R = ρ(cid:2) 
e , is typically of order 10 3 at normal conditions. 
As the temperature of the vessel is increased, the liquid evapo- 
rates and a new phase-equilibrium condition is attained in which 
the  pressure  increases  as  well  in  accordance  with  the  Clausius–
Clapeyron relation. During this process, the interface thickens and 
the density ratio decreases to a value close to unity near the crit- 
ical pressure P c , at which the two phases become visually indis- 
tinguishable. Above the critical pressure, P > P c , the ﬂuid is super- 
critical with a uniquely deﬁned density ρ for each thermodynamic 
state ( P , T ), thereby preventing the existence of an interface. Mean- 
while, the surface tension necessarily vanishes at P ≥ P c ; the limit 
P → P c is taken here in combination with T → T c [53,54] . 

The  transition  from  subcritical  to  supercritical  conditions  de- 
scribed above can be visualized in laboratory experiments involv- 
ing the thermodynamic characterization of pure substances by us- 
ing equilibrium cells [52,55] . A sequence of photographs that il- 
lustrates  the  vanishing  distinction  between  the  two  phases  in  a 
system approaching and crossing the critical point of propane is 
provided in Fig. 5 (a). 

F ≤ T e ≤ T 

In contrast with closed systems, combustors involve continuous 
ﬂows of propellants. Consider a cold liquid jet injected at tempera- 
F and atmospheric pressure into its own hot vapor at temper- 
ture T 
ature T 
O , with T e being the vapor-liquid equilib- 
O , where T 
rium (VLE) or boiling temperature at the corresponding pressure. 
The resulting liquid-to-gas density ratio ρ
O is of order 10 3 . The 
liquid jet breaks up due to unbalances between aerodynamic and 
surface-tension forces [45,56–60] as illustrated in Fig. 5 (b). A rela- 
tively large amount of energy, comparable to the thermal enthalpy 
of the hot environment, must be transferred to the spray to heat it 
up and vaporize it [61] . 

F / ρ

Similarly  to  the  closed  vessel  operating  at  normal  pressure, 
the  thickness  of  the  liquid-gas  interface  in  the  jet  ﬂow  men- 
tioned above is several orders of magnitude smaller than any of 
the  relevant  hydrodynamic  scales  involved.  Nonetheless,  predic- 
tive  simulation  capabilities  have  been  developed  in  recent  years 

9 

using  interface-capturing  methods  such  as  the  volume-of-ﬂuid 
or  level-set  formulations,  both  of  which  volumetrically  incorpo- 
rate the surface-tension force in the momentum equation through 
a  surface-tension  coeﬃcient  σ multiplied  by  the  interface  cur- 
vature  and  by  a  Dirac-delta  function  localized  at  the  interface 
[62–66] .  As  the  ambient  pressure  P ∞  increases,  the  liquid-to- 
gas  density  ratio  decreases.  In  particular,  the  interface  becomes 
thicker  as  the  critical  pressure  is  approached,  both  surface  ten- 
sion  and  vaporization  enthalpy  decrease,  and  the  atomization 
process  becomes  a  mixing  between  gas-like  ﬂuids  without  any 
breakup. 

Entering the supercritical region, it is important to distinguish 
between supercritical gas-like and supercritical liquid-like ﬂuids as 
depicted in Fig. 4 . As discussed in Appendix B.4 , the factors that 
separate the behavior of liquid-like from gas-like supercritical ﬂu- 
ids are: 

(a) A supercritical liquid-like ﬂuid is one whose density is large, 
whose isothermal compressibility is small, and whose transport 
coeﬃcients behave in a manner that is reminiscent of a liquid, 
with decreasing viscosities and thermal conductivities found at 
increasingly larger values of temperature, whereas the mass dif- 
fusivity remains mostly constant or increases slowly with tem- 
perature. 

(b) In  contrast,  the  density  of  supercritical  gas-like  ﬂuids  is  rel- 
atively  smaller,  their  isothermal  compressibility  is  larger,  and 
their  viscosity,  thermal  conductivity,  and  mass  diffusivity  in- 
crease  with  temperature,  thus  resembling  the  behavior  ob- 
served in gases. At high temperatures, T (cid:10) T c , and despite the 
high  pressures,  the  intermolecular  distances  are  suﬃciently 
large for the supercritical gas-like ﬂuid to behave like an ideal 
gas. 

At  pressures  not  too  large  compared  to  P c ,  a  clear  tran- 
sition  from  liquid-like  to  gas-like  supercritical  behavior  occurs 
pb  denoted  by 
at  the  pseudo-boiling,  or  Widom,  temperature  T 
the  thick  green  dot-dashed  line  in  Fig.  4  (see  Refs.  [67,68]  and 
Appendix B.4 for related discussions). This temperature depends on 
pb ∼ 130 K at 40 bar 
pressure and is not too different from T c (e.g., T 
2 , for which T c = 126 K). In par- 
and T 
pb  corresponds approximately to the temperature where 
ticular, T 
a second-order phase transition occurs, with the density, viscosity 
and thermal conductivity plunging as transition from a liquid-like 
to a gas-like state occurs, and with the speciﬁc heat at constant 
pressure displaying a characteristic ﬁnite-amplitude spike [69,70] . 
As the pressure becomes increasingly larger than P c , the distinction

between liquid-like and gas-like supercritical behavior is increas- 
ingly more diﬃcult to ascertain. Consequently, the dynamical rele- 
vance of the pseudo-boiling line diminishes away from the critical 
point. 

The chamber pressure in the jet ﬂow shown in the right panel 
in Fig. 5 (b) is supercritical, but the jet and ambient temperatures

are, respectively, smaller and larger than T 
characterized those conditions as transcritical [5,8,26–29,31] . How- 

ever, surface-tension effects are irrelevant in monocomponent sys- 
tems  above  the  critical  point  [53,71–74]  as  corroborated,  for  in- 
stance, by the absence of a spray in the right panel in Fig. 5 (b). Fur- 
thermore, the decrease of surface tension with pressure and tem- 
perature is continuous, and as a result its value is always of little to 
no dynamical relevance even at subcritical conditions nearing the 
critical point in monocomponent systems. As a result, the liquid- 
2 jet in the right panel in Fig. 5 (b) mixes with

2.2. Transcriticality in bicomponent systems 

Bicomponent  systems  behave  fundamentally  different  from 
monocomponent  ones  and  can  lead  to  spray  formation  at  com- 
bustor  pressures  that  are  supercritical  with  respect  to  the  sepa- 
rate components, P ∞ > max{ P 
c ,O } [15–19,22,23] . As shown in 
c ,F , P 
Section 3.2 , an important physical characteristic enabling the for- 
mation of the spray is that binary mixtures of heavy hydrocarbons 
with typical oxidizers, including pure oxygen (for rockets) and air 
(for gas-turbine jet engines and diesel engines), have much higher 
critical  pressures  than  those  of  the  individual  components.  For 
mixtures of n-alkanes with O 
2 , this effect is easily recognizable as 
a promontory in the coexistence region of the phase diagram along 
the  pressure  axis.  For  mixtures  of  n-alkanes  with  N 
2  or  air,  the 
maximum pressure of the coexistence region diverges [21,75,76] . 
Consequently, even at supercritical pressures with respect to both 
components, the system can traverse the coexistence region when 
the injection temperatures of the two propellant streams are op- 
positely placed on either side of it. These incursions in the coexis- 
tence region, which engender transcritical behavior in combustors, 
are particularly likely when the injection temperature of at least 
one of the propellant streams (typically the heavy hydrocarbon fuel 
stream) is smaller than its critical temperature. 

An innermost zone is encountered within the coexistence re- 
gion of the thermodynamic phase diagram that is bounded by the 
spinodal lines similarly to Fig. 4 for a pure component. In binary 
systems,  this  zone  can  exist  above  the  critical  pressures  of  the 
separate components due to the elevation of the critical pressure 
of the mixture, as mentioned above. This zone is thermodynam- 
ically unstable, in that no stable thermodynamic state exists that 
describes a spatially homogeneous mixture there. On the contrary, 
in those conditions, the components tend to stay separated into 
two ﬂuids bounded by an interface where capillary forces become 
important. This phenomenon is observed in experiments (e.g., see 
Refs. [15–23] ), but not necessarily in computations unless an ap- 
propriate formulation of the problem, such as the diffuse-interface 
theory developed in this review article, is employed that accounts 
for interfaces consistently with the thermodynamic stability of the 
mixture. 

In bicomponent systems at high pressures, the ﬂuids on each 
side  of  the  interface,  or  on  each  side  of  the  coexistence  region 
of the thermodynamic phase diagram, cease to be different ordi- 
nary phases such as liquid and vapor, and instead become distinct 
supercritical ﬂuids whose composition depends on the particular 
conﬁguration. For instance, in the problem depicted in Fig. 1 , the 
two participating ﬂuids are a liquid-like supercritical mixture rich 
in  a  heavy  hydrocarbon  on  the  fuel  side  of  the  interface,  and  a 
gas-like supercritical mixture rich in coﬂow species (e.g., O 
2 , 
or air) on the coﬂow side of the interface. Fundamental differences 
between gas-like and liquid-like supercritical C 
2  mixtures 
are analyzed in Appendix B.4 .

In the present theory, the transcritical interface is a physical- 
space representation of the coexistence region. References to VLE 
lines  at  high  pressures  should  therefore  be  understood  as  the 
loci of points where gas-like and liquid-like supercritical ﬂuids –
rather than classic vapor and liquid states – coexist. Pseudo-boiling 
conditions are attained within the transcritical interface, these be- 
ing understood in multicomponent systems as approximately the 
conditions where the constant-pressure molar heat of the mixture 
attains  a  local  maximum,  and  where  transition  between  liquid- 
like and gas-like supercritical behavior takes place, as discussed in 
Appendices B.2 and B.4 .

c ,F is typically 20 0–40 0 K larger than T 

As noted in Section 1.1 , the disparity between the critical ( T 

c ,F ) 
and injection ( T 
F ) temperatures of the fuel stream plays an impor- 
tant role in the onset of transcriticality in combustors fueled by 
heavy  hydrocarbons.  The  larger  this  disparity,  the  larger  the  su- 
percriticalization length L 
TR , and the more favored are transcritical 
thermodynamic trajectories across the elevated coexistence dome. 
As indicated in Table 1 , T 
F , 
since the latter is typically limited to 300–450 K in order to min- 
imize carbon deposition by thermal decomposition of the fuel in 
feeding systems and engine wall-cooling channels  [77] . At  those 
injection  temperatures,  heavy-hydrocarbon  fuels  resemble  super- 
critical liquid-like ﬂuids. That tendency increases with the number 
of carbon atoms due to the corresponding increase in the fuel crit- 
ical temperature: T c, F = 191 K for CH 
14 , 540 K for 
C 
26 . However, this is 
22 , and 658 K for C 
7 H 
counterbalanced by an increasing supercriticality in pressure with 
increasing number of carbon atoms: P c, F = 46 bar for CH

In  contradistinction,  the  critical  temperature  of  the  coﬂow 
stream is much smaller: T c = 155 K for O 
2 , and 131 K 
for air. As a result, the coﬂow stream often resembles a gas-like su- 
percritical ﬂuid in propulsion systems operating at high pressures, 
including (a) gas-turbine jet engines, where the air coﬂow entering 
O ∼ 70 0–10 0 0 K; (b) diesel engines, where the

and (c) thrust chambers of O

gines, where the oxidizer stream is preheated to T 
in a preburner. All these systems operate in the transcritical con- 
ditions discussed in Section 1.1 . 

2.3. Transcriticality in aerospace propulsion systems 

Developments in aviation jet-propulsion technologies have been 
characterized  over  the  last  ﬁve  decades  by  ever-growing  overall 
pressure ratios (OPR) as a means of increasing thermal eﬃciency 
2 ,  and  unburnt  hydrocarbons. 
and  reducing  emissions  of  CO,  CO 
This trend is illustrated in Fig. 6 (a). The overall pressure ratio of 
a jet engine can be approximated as OPR ≈ P ∞ / P a , where P ∞ is the 
combustor pressure and P a  is the ambient pressure at the corre- 
sponding  ﬂight  altitude.  At  sea  level,  P a = 1  bar  and  OPR  is  ap- 
proximately  equal  to  P ∞  in  bars.  Modern  engine  designs  reach 
OPR ∼ 50–60,  which  translate  into  fully  supercritical  combustor 
pressures P ∞ ∼ 50–60 bar at takeoff. At these pressures, the fuel is 
injected as a supercritical liquid-like ﬂuid into a supercritical gas- 
like air coﬂow, thereby leading to the transcritical conditions de- 
picted in Fig. 1 . Transcriticality in the combustor may persist up 
to ﬂight altitudes of 2.7 km for OPR = 50, and 4.2 km for OPR = 60, 
above which the combustor pressure P ∞ becomes smaller than the 
critical pressure of air, P c = 36 bar. 

Whereas  diesel  and  gas-turbine  jet  engines  are  now  mature 
technologies that operate with air and derivatives of kerosene at 
standardized injection temperatures, the propellant combinations 
and injection conditions are much more numerous in rocket en- 
gines due to big leaps in designs over the last 80 years, as sum- 
marized in Table 2 . Early developments in rocket propulsion dur- 
ing the V-2 program involved the utilization of a steam-catalyst- 
generator cycle at subcritical pressure P ∞ ∼ 15 bar [79] . Motivated 
by  the  need  of  higher  thrust  to  lift  heavier  payloads  to  orbit 
and accomplish longer-range mission proﬁles in space exploration 
and  military  applications,  the  operating  pressures  in  rocket  en- 
gines have increased signiﬁcantly over recent decades, as indicated 
in Fig. 6 (b), and they have reached values much larger than the 
critical pressures of the propellants. Typical pressures range from 
P ∞ ∼ 70 bar in the F-1 gas-generator rocket engine employed dur- 
ing  the  Apollo  program,  to  P ∞ ∼ 250–350  bars  in  thrust  cham-

the RD-180 and Raptor, whose preburners operate at much higher 
pressures of about 50 0–60 0 bar. 

In  rockets  fueled  by  RP-1  (a  highly  reﬁned  kerosene  whose 
critical point can be approximated as P c = 22 bar and T c = 677 K 
[42] ),  the  fuel  is  injected  at  temperatures  ranging  from  near- 
F ∼ 280  K  in  gas  generators  and  preburners,  to 
storage  values  T 
F ∼ 320 K in thrust chambers after passing through the wall cool- 
T 
ing  channels.  In  RP-1-fueled  open-cycle  systems  such  as  the  F- 
1  and  Merlin  engines,  whose  gas  generators  and  thrust  cham- 
bers operate at 60–100 bar, the liquid oxidizer (LOX) is injected 
O ∼ 90–100  K.  As  a  re- 
at  near-storage  cryogenic  temperatures  T 
sult, the RP-1 and LOX resemble liquid-like supercritical ﬂuids at 

injection  in  the  gas  generator  and  thrust  chamber.  Much  higher 
pressures  are  achieved  in  RP-1-fueled  closed  cycles  such  as  the 
RD-170 and RD-180 engines. The preburners of these engines op- 
erate  with  RP-1  and  LOX  injected  at  very  high  combustor  pres- 
sures P ∞ > 500 bar but at cold near-storage temperatures, thereby 
resembling  supercritical  liquid-like  ﬂuids.  The  O 
2 -rich  hot  com- 
bustion  products  from  the  preburner  are  expanded  in  the  tur- 
O ∼ 60 0–70 0 K along with the 
bine and injected at temperatures T 
cold RP-1 stream into the thrust chamber at pressures larger than 
200 bar. The resulting transcritical conditions in the thrust cham- 
ber  are  analogous  to  those  depicted  in  Fig.  1 ,  with  RP-1  and 
oxidizer  entering  as  liquid-like  and  gas-like  supercritical  ﬂuids, 
respectively.

2 -fueled  rocket  engines,  the  role  of  the  fuel  and  coﬂow 
streams  is  opposite  to  that  shown  in  Fig.  1 ,  in  that  the  LOX 
stream  occupies  the  center  core,  whereas  the  H 
2  stream  is  the 
coﬂow  [43,84,85,89] .  As  discussed  in  Section  3.2 ,  the  thermody- 
2 mixtures is qualitatively similar to 
namic phase diagram of H 
those  of  mixtures  of  n-alkanes  with  N 
2  is 
typically recirculated through the wall cooling channels, or is in- 
jected via fuel-rich combustion products exhausted from the pre- 
burner,  its  temperature  is  always  much  larger  than  the  critical 
value T c = 33 K, and often larger than the critical temperature of 
oxygen.  Correspondingly,  the  H 
2  and  LOX  streams  resemble,  re- 
spectively, gas-like and liquid-like supercritical ﬂuids at injection in 
thrust chambers of rocket engines such as the SSME or Vinci. The 
resulting transcritical conditions may involve supercriticalization of 
the oxidizer stream upon undergoing relatively small temperature 
increments of order T c, O − T O ∼ 50 K by heat transfer from the hot 
hydrogen stream. However, at elevated pressures, when the com- 
bustor is ignited and the oriﬁce ring is thick, results from exist- 
ing numerical simulations suggest that the ensuing diffusion ﬂame 
may be anchored so close to the oriﬁce that it would rapidly super- 
criticalize the oxidizer, thereby diminishing the practical relevance 
of the transcritical region [25] . 

Some  of  the  most  recent  rocket  engines  currently  under  de- 
sign or testing, such as BE4 (oxidizer-rich staged-combustion cy- 
cle, P ∞ ∼ 134 bar in thrust chamber) and Raptor (full-ﬂow staged- 
combustion cycle, P ∞ ∼ 300 bar in thrust chamber) operate with

2.4. Additional research aspects of transcritical systems 

There exist several other aspects that may be of technological 
and scientiﬁc relevance that have been intentionally left out of the 
remainder of this paper because of their complexity: 

(a) The autoxidation and pyrolysis of the heavy-hydrocarbon fuel as 
it progressively heats up ﬂowing downstream of the injection 
oriﬁce in transcritical conﬁgurations similar to that depicted in 
Fig. 1 . The breakdown of the fuel may cause variations in its 
physical properties (including surface tension) that could inﬂu- 
ence atomization [90] . 

(b) The release of chemical heat as a result of combustion reactions 
between fuel and oxidizer, which may contribute through con- 
duction and radiation to prompt supercriticalization of the ﬂow 
upstream and around ﬂames [10,25,32] . 

(c) The role of the complex thermodynamic-state spaces of tertiary 
and higher-degree mixtures of heavy hydrocarbons with oxy- 
gen, nitrogen, and combustion products at high pressures, the 

13

understanding of which remains mostly incomplete in the liter- 
ature. 

(d) The transition from subcritical to supercritical combustor pres- 
sures during ignition sequences, including in-space ignition of 
upper stages of rocket space launchers or spacecraft reaction- 
control thrusters [91] . In particular, as observed in the phase 
diagrams  introduced  in  Section  3 ,  hydrocarbon  fuels  such  as 
c ,F  early dur- 
CH 
ing engine ignition may undergo complex processes until fully 
supercritical pressures are attained in the combustor, including 
retrograde condensation when the combustor pressure becomes 
similar to the phase-equilibrium pressure at T

3. Thermodynamic phase diagrams of mixtures fueled by heavy 
hydrocarbons 

The physical-space solution of the diffuse-interface formulation 
developed  in  this  review  article  has  a  direct  correspondence  to 
thermodynamic states in the phase diagram. In this section, quan- 
titative  descriptions  of  phase  diagrams  of  relevant  mixtures  are 
provided. 

3.1. Equation of state 

1 , Y 

The thermodynamic space of solutions for the state variables 
{ P , ρ, T , and Y 
2 ... Y N−1 } of a single substance or a mixture of N 
components is described by its phase diagram. In this notation, Y 
i 
is the mass fraction of species i , with Y N = 1 −
i . A ﬁrst con- 
straint on the state variables that narrows down all of their possi- 
ble combinations is provided by an equation of state. One popular 
choice for systems at high pressures, which is used in this study, 
is the Peng-Robinson equation of state [92]

i is the mean molecular weight, with W

and X

and molar fraction of species i , respectively. The coeﬃcients a and

ﬁnite packing volume, respectively, and depend on the critical tem- 
peratures, critical pressures, and acentric factors of the individual 
mixture components, as well as on the local temperature and mix- 
ture composition. In particular, a and b are obtained by ﬁrst com- 
puting the individual values of the coeﬃcients for each species, a

diagram for multiple values of Y F . Experimentally measured critical points obtained

– in conditions of coexistence – the multivalued character of the 
density (in monocomponent ﬂows) and the fugacity (in multicom- 
ponent ﬂows), as discussed in Section 4 . Like many other mem- 
bers  of  the  family  of  cubic  equations  of  state,  Eq.  (14)  provides 
three  values  of  the  density  for  the  same  pressure  P  in  the  co- 
existence region in monocomponent ﬂows. Correspondingly, every 
isotherm  passing  through  the  coexistence  region  contains  a  sin- 
gle oscillation or Maxwell loop, as shown in Fig. 4 . This behavior 
is consistent with thermodynamic stability theory, which predicts 
two neutral-stability points, namely the spinodal points. The lat- 
ter can be unambiguously identiﬁed with the maximum and min- 
imum  of  the  looping  isotherm.  Several  other  cubic  equations  of 
state, including the classic interpolating formula of van der Waals 
[51] , are available in the literature that have similar characteris- 
tics and have been ubiquitously employed for treating real-gas ef- 
fects at high pressures [54,96–99] . Enhanced accuracy in the pre- 
diction of thermodynamic states outside the coexistence region can 
be achieved by using multiparameter equations of state. However, 
these equations tend to contain multiple Maxwell loops within the 
coexistence region that lead to artiﬁcial intermediate pseudo-stable 
states [99] . Improved multi-parameter equations of state with de- 
pressed or no intermediate loops in the coexistence region have 
been recently developed that may be amenable to coupling with 
diffuse-interface formulations [100] .

where ϑ

i , j are binary-interaction parameters listed in Appendix C . 

Volume-translating corrections to the Peng-Robinson equation 
(14) exist that provide a higher accuracy of the density near the 
critical point [93–95] , but are not considered in the present study 
since they tend to lead to a mismatch of the speciﬁc heat, which 
is an undesirable characteristic for describing the transfer of heat 
across  the  transcritical  interface.  As  a  result,  all  supplementary 
thermodynamic relations written in Appendix C have been partic- 
ularized  for  the  standard  version of  the  Peng-Robinson  equation 
(14) . 

The  particular  choice  of  Eq.  (14)  as  equation  of  state  is  not 
fundamental  to  the  theory  developed  here.  The  only  indispens- 
able characteristic of Eq. (14) is that it is capable of reproducing 

This  section  focuses  on  numerical  calculations  of  thermody- 
namic phase diagrams of selected mixtures. Basic concepts of ther- 
modynamic stability and phase equilibrium, including formal def- 
initions  of  the  VLE  lines,  along  with  mechanical  and  diffusional 
critical lines for mixtures, are required to follow this discussion. 
Those are provided in Appendix A . In particular, the calculations 
in  this  section  employ  Eq.  (A.3)  for  the  mechanical  spinodals, 
Eqs. (A .3) and (A .4) for the mechanical critical line, Eq. (A .9) for 
the diffusional spinodals, Eqs. (A .9) –(A .11) for the diffusional crit- 
ical line, along with Eqs. (A .12) , (A .13) and (A .15) for the coexis- 
tence envelope, with the fugacity being deﬁned in Eq. (B.21) from 
Appendix B and particularized for the Peng-Robinson equation of 
state in Eq. (C.47) from Appendix C . These constraints are supple- 
mented with the equation of state (14) , where the coeﬃcients a

with  Eqs.  (C.10) –(C.12) .  Auxiliary  quantities  required  for  the  cal- 
culations include the critical pressures and temperatures listed in 
Table 1 , along with the acentric and binary-interaction parameters 
listed in Appendix C . Combustion chemical reactions are neglected 
here when constructing phase diagrams involving mixtures of fuel 
and oxidizer because of the relatively low temperatures considered 
within  the  visualization  windows.  Practical  methods  for  the  cal- 
culation of VLE and diffusional critical lines are available in Refs. 
[101–105] .

Depending  on  the  physical  properties  of  the  mixture  compo- 
nents, binary mixtures can be classiﬁed in types that display vastly 
different  forms  of  the  phase  diagram.  Details  on  such  classiﬁca- 
tion can be found in Ref. [106] , which employs the van der Waals 
equation  of  state  subject  to  phase-equilibrium  and  critical-point 
constraints  such  as  those  in  Appendix  A  (see  also  Ref.  [107]  for 
a historical perspective on this subject). Speciﬁcally, the analysis 
and associated simpliﬁcations carried out in Ref. [106] , including 
the assumption of equal excluded volumes b 
O (or equivalently, 
T 
c ,F ), pointed at the difference between the critical 
c ,O / T 
temperatures of the two components, | T c, F − T c, O | , as an important 
factor in determining the structure of the coexistence region of the 
mixture at high pressures. Several other factors may however par- 
ticipate when more complex equations of state are used because of 
the additional parameters involved. In addition, in the mixtures fu- 
eled by heavy hydrocarbons examined here, the less volatile com- 
ponent (i.e., the heavy-hydrocarbon fuel) does not always have the 
largest critical pressure. Despite these shortcomings, some of the 
qualitative  observations  made  in  Ref.  [106] ,  including  the  occur- 
rence of coexistence regions that are unbounded in pressure, hold 
true in the present analysis.

2  mixtures described by the Peng-Robinson equa- 
tion of state (14) and the mixing rules (15) , the phase diagram does 
not contain a continuous critical line joining the critical points of 
the  individual  components,  and  the  coexistence  region  becomes 
unbounded in pressure. This phenomenon is shown in the thermo- 
dynamic phase diagram in Fig. 7 , where isocomposition projections 
of the phase-equilibrium surface on the P − T  plane are provided. 
A  three-dimensional  visualization  of  the  elevation  of  the  critical

ature.

The computation of critical points in complex mixtures involves 
a  number  of  assumptions  and  model-parameter  values  that  ﬁnd 
no clear justiﬁcation on physical grounds. For instance, the mixing 
rules (15) correspond to molar weighting of the individual coef- 
ﬁcients a 
i , whose expressions depend on calibrated inter- 
action parameters and measured critical points of the pure sub- 
stances (see Appendix C ). It is however remarkable that the critical 
line calculated in Figs. 7 and 8 (a) agrees well with values experi- 
mentally obtained in Ref. [75] , including the divergent trend of the 
critical pressure. 
Since  N 

2  and 
26 /air  mixtures  lead  to  similar  thermodynamic  behavior,  as 
C 
shown  in  Fig.  8 (b).  Note  that  the  mechanical  critical  point  of 
air  provided  in  Table  1  is  very  similar  to  its  diffusional  critical 
point  (P c = 37  bar , T c = 131  K )  obtained  in  Fig.  9 (a)  using  Eqs. 
(A .9) and (A .11) . This is because the coexistence envelope of N 
2 /O 
2 
mixtures  does  not  exceed  the  critical  pressures  of  the  separate 
components.

lead to coexistence envelopes unbounded in pressure. However, a 
bounded elevation of the critical point still occurs in those mix- 
tures,  as  shown  in  Figs.  8 (c)  and  9 (b),  where  a  promontory  in

700 bar at ambient temperature.

Additional phase diagrams of relevant binary mixtures are pro-

2 or N 
with O

scribed above for C 
gion  in  H 
2 -fueled  mixtures  exists  only  for  a  narrow  interval  of 
cryogenic  temperatures,  whose  width  decreases  rapidly  with  in- 
creasing pressure. In contrast, mixtures of O

lead  to  bounded  coexistence  regions  similar  to  that  observed  in

with air or N 
2 , which are relevant for new generations of rocket 
engines (e.g., BE-4 and Raptor) and for land-based gas turbines, re- 
spectively. In those mixtures, the pressure of the diffusional crit- 
ical line is never too far above the critical pressures of the sepa- 
rate components. As a result, those systems are mostly dominated 
by interfaceless, homogeneously mixed states when the pressure is 
supercritical with respect to both components ( P (cid:2) 50 bar).

Although no equilibrium trajectories connecting the two injec- 
tion states of the propellants exist in general ﬂows, it is convenient 
to locate along a trajectory on the phase diagram the local thermo- 
dynamic state of points normal to the transcritical interface in the 
conﬁgurations that will be addressed in Sections 6 and 7 . In this 
study,  these  trajectories  are  referred  to  as  pseudo-trajectories  to 
emphasize that they are not thermodynamic trajectories followed 
by the system by quasi-statically changing its state, as traditionally 
meant in the theory of thermodynamics of closed systems. A no- 
tional envelope of transcritical pseudo-trajectories is provided in 
Fig.  10  that  joins  the  characteristic  injection-temperature  ranges 
O ∼ 70 0–10 0 0  K  of  the  propellant  streams.

It  will  be  shown  in  Sections  6  and  7  that  transcritical  pseudo- 
trajectories are characterized by crossing the coexistence region of 
the thermodynamic phase diagram of the mixture. Note, however, 
that  any  pseudo-trajectory  plotted  on  constant-pressure  cross-

Fig. 10 , should be interpreted with caution, since signiﬁcant vari- 
ations of the thermodynamic pressure occur across the interface 
away from the edge, as discussed in Sections 4 and 5 . 

The considerations above suggest that the selection of particu- 
lar values of injection temperatures and combustor pressures may 
lead to operating conditions without transcritical interfaces. For in- 
stance, if the injection temperature of C 
26 in Fig. 10 is increased 
to  values  larger  than  T 
c ,diff while  maintaining  constant  the  hot 
temperature  of  the  nitrogen  coﬂow,  the  pseudo-trajectories  will 
not cross the coexistence region, and the ﬂow will not bear any 
transcritical  interfaces.  This  circumvention of  the  coexistence  re- 
gion may be achieved dynamically because of supercriticalization 
of the fuel stream by heat transfer from the coﬂow, as shown in 
Fig. 2 and discussed in Section 7 .

by a correction to the bulk free energy that involves a coeﬃcient 
multiplied by the square of the density gradient [111] . 

The equivalent description of thermodynamic potentials in mul- 
ticomponent systems is based on the gradients of the partial den- 
sities  [116,117] .  For  instance,  the  speciﬁc  values  of  the  gradient- 
dependent Helmholtz free energy f , internal energy e , and entropy 
s are [38,39,110]

temperature provides the limiting combustor pressure P ∞ above which interfaces 
cannot exist. 

4.1. Gradient-dependent thermodynamic potentials 

The  diffuse-interface  theory  was  ﬁrst  formulated  by  van  der 
Waals in Ref. [108] , where the ﬁnite-thickness structure of an in- 
terface between liquid and vapor phases in isothermal hydrostatic 
monocomponent systems was described by performing spatial in- 
tegrations  of  the  intermolecular  potential  in  the  presence  of  a 
mean density gradient. The reader is referred to seminal treatises 
based on the molecular theory of liquids for in-depth expositions 
of the topic [53] . This formalism was later extended to study bi- 
nary mixtures near the critical point by Cahn and Hilliard [109] . 
More recently, notable work has been done to couple consistently 
the  diffuse-interface  theory  of  van  der  Waals  with  conservation 
equations of ﬂuid motion [110–115] . Developments of the diffuse- 
interface theory for treating the mechanics of interfaces in complex 
mixtures have been applied mostly to 1D phase-transitioning sys- 
tems in hydrostatic equilibrium at uniform temperature to provide 
predictions of the surface-tension coeﬃcients [116–118] . The inves- 
tigation of hydrodynamic and thermal effects in the formulation is 
a discipline that is currently in its infancy. 

The diffuse-interface theory of van der Waals addresses mono- 
component thermodynamic systems traversing the coexistence re- 
gion as they become macroscopically separated into phases. Specif- 
ically, the diffuse-interface theory describes the mechanics of the 
transition layer, which gives rise to familiar surface-tension forces 
emerging from the resistance of the interface to get deformed. Al- 
though the predicted interfaces are hydrodynamically thin, and the 
theory is formulated at the continuum level, the results agree well 
with  experiments  and  molecular  dynamics  simulations  [99,116–
119] . 

On average, molecules in ideal gases are separated by long dis- 
tances that make the intermolecular forces negligible. In contrast, 
the  increased  molecular  packing  at  high  pressures  requires  con- 
sideration of  intermolecular  forces, which are manifested by the 
second term in the equation of state (14) involving the coeﬃcient 
a .  The  latter  is  proportional  to  the  zeroth-moment  of  the  inter- 
molecular potential in the far-ﬁeld attraction range [53] . In highly 
density-stratiﬁed  conditions  as  those  found  across  interfaces  in 
monocomponent systems, the effect of long-range attraction forces 
is compounded by the fact that the integration of the spherico- 
symmetric intermolecular potential across the stratiﬁed zone re-

either require knowledge of the underlying molecular structure of 
the ﬂuid, or must be tuned by comparing theoretical results with 
experimental data.

4.3. Open issues of experimentally calibrated models for 
gradient-energy coeﬃcients 

Gradient-energy coeﬃcients computed from experimentally cal- 
ibrated relations such as Eq. (23) are contrived by the manner that 
experiments are carried out. As the equilibrium cell is heated, and 
starting from a phase-separated state in vapor-liquid equilibrium, 
both P and T reach their critical values simultaneously because of 
vapor-liquid equilibrium. As a result, the pressure dependency on 
Eq.  (23) ,  and  similar  ones  encountered  in  the  literature,  is  arti- 
ﬁcially  concealed  in  the  temperature.  Relevant  steps  toward  im- 
proved models of gradient-energy coeﬃcients have been recently 
undertaken by Dahms [100] using parametrizations of κ
i , j in terms 
of the local partial-density gradients instead of temperature. 

Contrary to theoretical predictions [53,120] , which suggest that 
the gradient-energy coeﬃcient diverges near the critical point of 
the component, there are experimentally calibrated models such 
as Eq. (23) that remain ﬁnite there, as observed in Fig. 12 . How- 
ever, the singularity predicted by the theory is weak and in prac- 
tice is overruled by the rapid decrease in the density gradients on 
approach to the critical point, where both σ and d σ / dT vanish.

Three  approximations  in  the  gradient-energy  coeﬃcients  are

justiﬁcation for such geometric averaging appears to exist yet 
other than experimental observations of indirect quantities that 
ratify this choice [121] .

(c) As  shown  in  Section  5.6 ,  the  largest  variations  of  the  tem- 
perature occur across distances much larger than the interface 
thickness. Correspondingly, it is assumed herein that κ
i , j varies 
slowly in space around the interface, and therefore commutes 
with spatial derivatives. Temperature-induced variations in κ
are included explicitly by evaluating κ
ture in all expressions.

Additional  complications  arising  from  the  utilization  of  Eq. 
(23) or analogous ones [118] is that the experimentally calibrated 
gradient-energy coeﬃcients are not deﬁned for T > T 
c , i . Recall that 
a  monocomponent  system  cannot  engender  any  surface  tension 
for T > T c , since, as indicated in Fig. 4 , only a single homogeneous 
thermodynamic state is possible above the critical point. As a re- 
sult, the calibration of κ
c , i . In the 
transcritical conditions in Fig. 1 , in which T 
c ,O , the 
gradient-energy coeﬃcients given by Eq. (23) are not deﬁned in 
regions of the ﬂow where the local temperature is larger than the 
critical temperature of the corresponding component. This has the 
following implications: 

i , i must necessarily stop at T > T 

c ,F > T 

O > T 

F > T 

(a) Since the injection temperatures considered here are T 

F ∼ 300–
O ∼ 70 0–10 0 0  K,  the  temperature  is  everywhere 
450  K  and  T 
larger  than  the  critical  temperatures  of  typical  coﬂowing 
species,  including  N 
2 ,  and  air.  Consequently,  the  only 
gradient-energy  coeﬃcient  that  is  deﬁned  and  explicitly  ap- 
pears in the formulation is that of the fuel, denoted here by 
κ

the coﬂow side of the interface where T > T 

c ,F . 

F,F  is not deﬁned because T > T 

However, these limitations do not have signiﬁcant consequences 
on the theory developed here. As discussed in Section 1 , the in- 
terface vanishes at an edge when its temperature nears the tem- 
c ,diff, which is 10 − 40 K 
perature of the diffusional critical point T 
c ,F  in  the  pressure  range  P ∞ = 50–200  bar.  Corre- 
smaller  than  T 
spondingly, regions where κ
c ,F  are 
located either far away from the interface on the coﬂow side, or 
downstream  of  the  interface  edge,  as  schematically  indicated  in 
Fig.  13 .  Since  composition  gradients  in  those  regions  are  small 
compared to those encountered across the interface, the gradient- 
dependent corrections of the local thermodynamic potentials are 
dynamically irrelevant there regardless of whether κ
F,F is made to 
artiﬁcially plunge to zero at T = T c, F , or is extrapolated for T > T 
c ,F . 
i , j can be shown to be pro- 
portional  to  the  second  moment  of  the  intermolecular  potential 
(e.g., see Ch. 4 in Ref. [53] for details). It can also be expressed 
in terms of the direct correlation function in both single- and mul- 
ticomponent systems [122,123] . It is conceivable that future devel- 
opments in hydrodynamic applications of the diffuse-interface the- 
ory for high-pressure interfaces would beneﬁt from models of κ
i , j 
that could be cognizant of the microscale structure of supercritical 
ﬂuids and their mixtures. Multiscale modeling strategies based on

4.4. Characteristic scales in the diffuse-interface theory 

T , R 

The disparity between the interface thickness δ
I , and R 

I and the macro- 
scopic ﬂow scales δ
F plays a central role in the dynam- 
ics of the interface. The value of δ
I is closely connected with the 
gradient-energy coeﬃcient and with the surface tension σ . In par- 
ticular, Eq. (22) indicates that the gradient-energy coeﬃcient scales 
as 
κ ∼ σ0 δI /ρ 2 
F , 
where σ
F 
is the density of the fuel stream. In performing the estimate (26) , 
the characteristic density difference across the interface has been 
approximated as ρF (1 − 1 / R ) ≈ ρF , with R (cid:10) 1 the density ratio 
deﬁned in Eq. (4) . 

0  is a characteristic value of the surface tension, and ρ

(26) 

To understand the role of the gradient-energy coeﬃcient in the 
present  theory,  it  is  important  to  note  that  any  thermodynamic 
variable that oscillates across the coexistence region in the phase 
diagram can be mapped into physical space within an interface- 
like proﬁle of an indicator function such as ρ( ˆ n ) in monocompo- 
nent ﬂows, or the partial densities in multicomponent ﬂows. Al- 
though the details of the mapping depend on the particular prob- 
lem and thermodynamic quantity under consideration, it is illus- 
trative to momentarily sideline the problem in Fig. 1 and focus on 
the most idealized case that can be addressed with the diffuse- 
interface theory, namely that of a ﬂat interface in a monocompo- 
nent isothermal ﬂow. In this case, the mapping is simpler and the 
free-stream densities correspond to those in phase equilibrium, i.e., 
ρF = ρ(cid:2) 

e and ρO = ρg 
e . 

As discussed in Appendix A.2 , in phase equilibrium, the chemi- 
cal potentials in both streams are the same and equal to the equi- 
librium value μe [see Eq. (A.16) ]. Similarly, since the temperatures 
of the streams must be equal in phase equilibrium, Eqs. (C.4) and 
(C.5) simplify, respectively, to 
dμ = dP/ρ

(27) 

and 
df = −P d(1 /ρ) .

In particular, Eq. (28) provides the deﬁnition of the pressure in

By substituting P from Eq. (14) into Eq. (29) and integrating the re-

stituted into Eq. (30) to obtain one for μ. The resulting expressions 
for f and μ are not essential here and are deferred to Appendix C . 
Equations (27) –(30) are standard expressions in thermodynam- 
ics that are useful here for the following reason. Since the pres- 
sure  P  is  an  oscillatory  function  of ρ across  the  coexistence  re- 
gion of the thermodynamic phase diagram (e.g., see Fig. 4 ), f and μ
are also oscillatory functions of ρ there. In particular, μ satisﬁes a 
Maxwell’s construction rule [126] , in that the oscillation of μ − μe 
(μ − μe ) dρ = 
F 
in the coexistence region encloses zero net area, 
O

which relates μ, ρ, and the normal coordinate to the interface  ˆ n . 
The derivation of Eq. (31) is deferred to Section 5.3 . It will also 
be shown in Section 5.6 that an equation similar to (31) exists for 
multicomponent isothermal systems. The boundary conditions of 
Eq. (31) are ρ = ρF at ˆ n → −∞ and ρ = ρO at ˆ n → + ∞ . The right- 
hand side of Eq. (31) vanishes far away on both sides of the inter- 
face, where the density gradients are negligible and the chemical 
potential attains the phase-equilibrium value μe . 

As  illustrated  in  Fig.  14 ,  the  expression  (31)  is  responsible 
for  mapping  the  oscillations  of  the  chemical  potential  in  the 
two-phase region of the thermodynamic space μ = μ(ρ) into an 
interface-like proﬁle ρ = ρ( ˆ n ) , in which ρ undergoes a rapid vari- 
F within a very short distance of order δ
ation of order ρ
I . To obtain 
an estimate of δ
I , Eq. (31) can be rewritten in terms of a nondi- 
mensional density 
ρ (cid:20) = ρ/ρF 
(32) 
and a nondimensional chemical potential μ(cid:20) = (μ − μe ) /A μ, with 
A μ the characteristic amplitude of the oscillation of μ in the co- 
existence region. In these variables, the ﬁrst integral of Eq. (31) is

Equation  (33)  evaluated  far  away  from  the  interface,  where 
ρ(cid:20) → 1 and ∂ ρ(cid:20) /∂ ˆ n → 0 , is consistent with Maxwell’s construction 
rule. The parameters κ, ρ
F , and A μ can be scaled out of Eq. (33) by 
deﬁning a dimensionless normal coordinate ˆ n (cid:20) = ˆ n /δI , with 
δI = (κρF /A μ) 1 / 2 .

The combination of Eqs. (26) and (34) yields 

(35) 

A μ ∼ σ0 / (δI ρF ) . 
In particular, Eq. (35) connects the oscillation amplitude A μ, which 
can be obtained independently from the thermodynamic relations 
(14) and (30) , with the intrinsic properties of the interface δ
I and 
σ
0 , the latter being a measurable quantity. A cornerstone of the 
diffuse-interface theory is that the order of magnitude of κ is set 
such that δ
I estimated from (34) is small enough to yield values of 
σ
0 from Eq. (22) comparable to the experimentally observed ones 
σ
I ∼ 1–100 nm and κ ∼ 10 −15 –10 −17 
0 ∼ 0.001–0.1 N/m. This gives δ
Jm 5 /kg 2 (see Fig. 12 ). 

The characteristic amplitude of the pressure oscillation within 
the interface, denoted by A P , is obtained from Eqs. (29) , (30) , and 
(35) giving 
A P ∼ ρF A μ ∼ σ0 /δI . 
Equation (36) yields A P ∼ 10–100 bar when the estimates for σ
0 
and δ
I  introduced above are employed. A dimensionless pressure 
parameter P can be deﬁned as the ratio of the characteristic pres- 
sure variation A P  across the interface to the combustor pressure 
P ∞ ,

is the compressibility factor. The dimensionless pressure parameter 
P increases with decreasing pressures. At near-atmospheric pres- 
sures,  P is  much  larger  than  unity,  and  the  pressure  oscillation 
predicted by the equation of state (14) can induce large negative 
pressures oftentimes observed in the form of tensile strength in 
liquids brought to metastable states by superheating them above 
the  boiling  temperature,  or  by  stretching  them  below  the  vapor 
pressure  [104,127,128] .  As  P ∞  increases, σ
I  in- 
creases, thereby rendering smaller values of A P and P. 

0  decreases  and δ

The  numerical  results  presented  in  Sections  6  and  7  indicate 
that the dimensionless pressure parameter P is of order unity in 
transcritical conditions. As a result, despite the large values of P ∞ 
involved, the present theory predicts that mechanically subcritical 
pressures, and even negative pressures, may occur within the in- 
terface. These aspects are further discussed in Appendix E as they 
may appear controversial in the description, although they do not 
have any signiﬁcant effect on the results presented here. 

4.5. The interface-continuum hypothesis 

The approximation of operating with a continuous ﬁeld across 
the transcritical interface while keeping only the gradient terms in 
the series expansion of the thermodynamic potentials, as in Eqs. 
(16) –(18) , is justiﬁed when the interface thickness δ
I is large com- 
pared to the characteristic mean free path (cid:14), or equivalently, when 
the Knudsen number 
Kn I = (cid:14)/δI 
is much smaller than unity. In multicomponent mixtures described 
by the hard-sphere model, (cid:14) is given by [129]

In this formulation, d

The  direct  application  of  Eq.  (41)  to  the  present  problem 
is  problematic  because  of  the  strong  composition  gradients  as- 
sociated  with  transcritical  interfaces.  In  the  calculations  of  Kn 
I 
shown  in  Section  6 ,  the  partial  densities  in  Eq.  (41)  are  ap- 
proximated as ρY 
F,max R 0 T e ) and ρ(1 − Y F ) ∼ (1 −
F /( Z 
X F , max ) P ∞ W O / (Z O , max R 0 T e ) , where T e is a characteristic interface 
temperature, and the subindex max denotes quantities evaluated 
at the location of maximum density gradient across the interface. 
With these approximations in mind, Eq. (41) becomes

where k B is the Boltzmann constant. For the monocomponent sys- 
tems calculated in Appendix D , Eq. (42) is used with X F , max = 1 , 
Z F , max = Z max , and d F = d. 

Small Knudsen numbers (40) are often found in monocompo- 
nent  systems  as  the  critical  point  is  neared,  when  δ
I  increases 
and (cid:14) decreases. For instance, the interface thickness calculated

in Appendix D for a monocomponent N

31  bar  is  δ
I ∼ 5  nm.  This  translates  into  approximately  32 N 
2 
I ∼ 0.05  (see 
molecules  across,  along  with  a  Knudsen  number  Kn 
Fig. D.3 in Appendix D ). However, it is widely accepted that the 
I (cid:8) 1 is not always satisﬁed by the diffuse-interface 
requirement Kn 
theory  of  van  der  Waals  as  the  pressure  becomes  increasingly 
smaller than P c [53,131,132] . This can be seen in the same mono- 
≈ 14 bar, 
component N 
for which δ
I ∼ 0.15, thereby indicating a larger rar- 
efaction and a weaker foundation for the continuum character of 
the theory. Despite these shortfalls, the diffuse-interface theory of 
van der Waals tends to reproduce well numerical results obtained 
from molecular dynamics (e.g., see Fig. 6 in Ref. [99] ). 

2 system mentioned above at P ∞ = 0 . 4 P c, N

I ∼ 2 nm and Kn 

The considerations above indicate that the continuum assump- 
tion  across  the  interface  is  often  on  the  borderline  of  invalidity. 
In the hydrocarbon-fueled mixtures analyzed in Figs. 7–9 (b–e), the 
pressures that can be reached before Kn 
I  becomes much smaller 
than unity and are much larger than those in monocomponent sys- 
tems because of the elevation of the critical point caused by mix- 
ing. It is however remarkable that no excessively large values of 
I that would indicate a ﬂagrant violation of the continuum as- 
Kn 
sumption are encountered at the high pressures studied here. Field 
formulations of ﬂuid motion are well-known for performing cor- 
rectly even in ﬂows where the continuum hypothesis may not be 
strictly satisﬁed [129] . The continuum treatment of diffuse inter- 
faces is reminiscent of the description of the internal structure of 
weak shock waves by using the Navier–Stokes equations despite 
the small shock thicknesses involved [133] . However, one impor- 
tant difference between shocks and interfaces is that the dynam- 
ics outside the shock discontinuity are independent of its internal 
structure, whereas the transport across the interface and its me- 
chanical coupling with the ﬂow fundamentally depend on the in- 
ternal structure of the interface, as discussed in Section 5 . 

The appropriateness of Eq. (41) as the relevant length scale to 
evaluate the continuum character of transcritical interfaces is also 
under suspicion. Recent molecular dynamics simulations [134] in- 
dicate that conﬁned gases undergo higher rates of collisions than 
those predicted by Eq. (41) . It could be plausible that an interface 
may lead to an effect similar to conﬁnement for the ﬂuids on each 
side  and  within  the  interface  itself.  Similarly,  a  recent  study  by 
Dahms [135] has found that the effective mean free path near the

4.6. The role of antidiffusion in transcritical ﬂows 

An important characteristic of the mass transport across tran- 
scritical interfaces at suﬃciently high pressures is the prevailing 
antidiffusion of matter that is predicted by the standard transport 
theory in conjunction with the equation of state (14) . To under- 
stand this, notice that the effective Fickian diffusion coeﬃcient par- 
ticipating in the standard species diffusion ﬂux of fuel at high pres- 
sures is not the binary diffusion coeﬃcient D F , O but [136,137]

Eq. (C.47) for the Peng-Robinson equation of state (14) . A formal 
derivation of Eq. (43) is deferred to Section 5 . 

In contrast to D F , O , which is always positive (see Fig. B.3 and 
related discussion in Appendix B.4 ), the effective Fickian diffusion 
F,F  can be negative for intermediate compositions at 
coeﬃcient D 
temperatures smaller than T

mixtures. The change in sign can be explained by the fact that the 
fuel fugacity oscillates across the coexistence region (and therefore 
across the interface) similarly to the fuel chemical potential, as dis- 
cussed in Appendix A.1 and illustrated in Fig. A.1 (a,b) for C

mixtures.

At moderate pressures or high temperatures approaching ideal- 
gas  conditions,  the  non-ideal  diffusion  prefactor  becomes  unity, 
( ∂ ln f 
F ) P , T → 1. Therefore D F , F (cid:7) D F , O and traditional forward 
molecular  diffusion  (i.e.,  diffusion  in  the  direction  of  decreasing 
fuel  concentration)  prevails.  At  high  pressures,  forward  diffusion 
dominates in the compositional mixing layer downstream of the 
interface edge. In contrast, near the injection oriﬁce, where the fuel 
is cold, the non-ideal prefactor ( ∂ ln f 
F ) P , T departs from unity 
and its sign changes depending on the local composition. In par- 
ticular, ( ∂ ln f 
F ) P , T  varies from positive values on the coﬂow 
and fuel sides of the interface, where forward diffusion prevails, 
to negative values within the transcritical interface, where mass is 
transported in an antidiffusive manner in the direction of positive

mixture,  as  sketched  in  Fig.  16 .  The  antidiffusion  of  matter  pre- 
dicted by the standard transport theory, which would lead to un- 
physical results, can be regularized by a an extra diffusion ﬂux de- 
rived from the diffuse-interface theory, as described in Section 5 . 

4.7. Conservation equations for transcritical ﬂows 

The  consideration  of  gradient-dependent  thermodynamic  po- 
tentials,  as  in  Eqs.  (16) –(17) ,  leads  to  interface-related  transport 
ﬂuxes  and  mechanical  stresses  in  the  conservation  equations.  In 
this study, a phenomenological approach described in Section 5 is 
followed based on linear augmentations of the deviatoric part of 
the stress tensor τ, and the heat and species diffusion ﬂuxes q and 
i , with the interfacial stress tensor K and transport ﬂuxes Q and 
J 
i . Expressions for K , Q , and J 
J 
i are derived in Section 5 . In terms 
of the material-derivative operator D/Dt = ∂ /∂ t + v · ∇, the result- 
ing conservation equations for mass, momentum, species, and total 
energy are

component ﬂuid of N species that moves at a mass-averaged veloc-

The ﬁrst term q t on the right-hand side of Eq. (49) comprises 
Fourier  and  Dufour  mechanisms  of  heat  transfer,  while  the  sec- 
ond term corresponds to heat transport by interdiffusion of species 
with different partial speciﬁc enthalpies h 
i , which are discussed in 
Appendices B.1 and C.8 . In addition, the symbol P GD is a gradient- 
dependent pressure given by

with  P  being  related  to  ρ,  T  and  Y 
i  through  the  equation  of 
state (14) . The convenience of delocalizing the pressure as in Eq. 
(50) will become clearer upon deriving an expression for the inter- 
facial stress tensor K in Section 5 . 

An alternative form of the energy Eq. (47) that will be employed 

in the analysis is the enthalpy conservation equation

(51) 

Equation (51) is obtained by subtracting the momentum conser- 
vation Eq. (45) multiplied by v from the total-energy conservation 
equation (47) , and by making use of the relation 
h = e GD + P GD /ρ

(52) 

obtained  from  the  deﬁnition  of  the  local  speciﬁc  enthalpy  h 
(C.3) along with Eqs. (17) and (50) . Methods for calculation of h 
at high pressures are discussed in Appendices B.1 and C.6 . 

The integration of the conservation equations Eqs. (44) –(47) is 
complicated  by  the  additional  terms  K ,  J 
i ,  and  Q ,  which  will 
be shown to depend on the square of gradients and higher-order 
derivatives  of  the  partial  densities  across  the  interface.  For  in- 
stance, a full numerical integration of the momentum Eq. (45) in 
the ﬂow sketched in Fig. 1 would incur signiﬁcant numerical stiff- 
ness, because the ratio of the interfacial terms to the convection 
terms would be a large parameter,

macroscopic lengths, a local formulation in the moving frame at- 
tached  to  the  interface  is  developed  that  provides  mechanical 
and  transport  equilibrium  constraints  applicable  to  interfaces  in 
isothermal systems. Moderate temperature gradients across the in- 
terface, such as those encountered in Fig. 1 , are shown to require 
the consideration of small deviations from equilibrium. 

5.1. Entropy-production sources 

The  derivation  of  K ,  Q ,  and  J 

i  is  performed  here  using  the 
method  of  irreversible  thermodynamics  and  Onsager’s  reciprocal 
relations. The premise of this method is that the constitutive rela- 
tions must lead to non-negative entropy production in accordance 
with the second principle of thermodynamics. This method paral- 
lels the one utilized to determine the analytical form of the trans- 
port ﬂuxes in the standard theory [138–140] . However, this method 
cannot give expressions for the transport coeﬃcients in terms of 
molecular properties. Those are provided separately in Appendices 
B.4 and F . 

The analysis begins by substituting Eqs. (17) and (50) into the 
ﬁrst principle (C.1) , and using the assumption of constant and sym- 
metric κ

ij coeﬃcients, which leads to

The quantities (67) are drivers of molecular transport, and conse- 
quently of entropy production. 

Different  transport  processes  induced  by  different  thermody- 
namic  forces  interfere  with  one  another.  For  instance,  in  addi- 
tion  to  causing  heat  conduction,  temperature  gradients  also  in- 
duce mass transport through the Soret effect. More generally, the 
transport ﬂuxes in the conservation equations can be written as 
a  combination  of  all  thermodynamic  forces,  and  such  combina- 
tion is linear in the ﬁrst approximation [138–140] . The derivation 
of these expressions is facilitated by assuming that the transport 
ﬂuxes  and  thermodynamic  forces  of  different  tensorial  character 
do not couple [141] . This simpliﬁcation implies that there are no 
crossed effects between the mechanical stresses, which are driven 
by the velocity-gradient tensor, and the ﬂuxes of heat and species, 
which are driven by gradients of temperature and chemical poten- 
tials. Based on these considerations, a closure is formulated for K 
in Section 5.2 , followed by a discussion in Section 5.3 on the ef- 
fective surface-tension coeﬃcient σ arising from this formulation. 
Onsager’s methodology will be used in Section 5.4 to determine 
the interfacial ﬂuxes of heat Q and species J 
i . 

5.2. Closure for the interfacial stress tensor 

In the case of Newtonian ﬂuids under zero bulk viscosity, the 

expression for the viscous stress tensor is 
τ = η

− (2 η/ 3)(∇ · v ) I , 

(cid:9)

where η is the dynamic viscosity modeled in Appendix F.1 . Vari- 
ations  of  η with  temperature  and  composition  are  studied  in 
Appendix  B.4  for  C 
2  mixtures  at  high  pressures.  Equa- 
tion (68) implies that the viscous dissipation τ: ∇v ≥ 0 is a pos- 
itive  quadratic  and  therefore  leads  to  positive  entropy  produc- 
tion. In contrast, the interfacial stress tensor K is assumed to be 
elastically  restoring,  such  that  the  production  of  entropy  by  the 
diffuse-interface terms multiplying the velocity-gradient tensor in 
Eq. (64) is zero, namely

by making use of the equation of state (14) and the deﬁnition of

ψ 
deﬁned in Eq. (B.7) and particularized for the Peng-Robinson equa- 
tion of state (14) in Eq. (C.22) . 

Following  an  approach  similar  to  that  provided  by  Onsager 
[138] (see also Ch. 11.2 in [140] , and Ch. 6 in Ref. [139] ), the en- 
tropy source (64) is interpreted as consisting of three production 
terms that have a similar form. Speciﬁcally, each term consists of a 
current multiplied by one of the following thermodynamic forces:

The interfacial stress tensor K was originally introduced by Ko- 
rteweg in a phenomenological manner [142] . The effects of K are 
concentrated  in  the  vicinity  of  the  interface,  where  the  partial- 
density gradients are the largest. In that region, the ﬁrst of the two 
terms on the right-hand side of Eq. (70) represents a hydrostatic 
stress. As shown in Section 5.3 , this term gives rise to a curvature- 
dependent pressure jump across the interface. The second term is 
an anisotropic stress that acts primarily in the direction normal to 
the interface. 

In this formulation, there is no explicit surface-tension coeﬃ- 
cient σ appearing in Eqs. (44) –(47) and (70) . However, σ resur- 
faces when the integral form of the momentum conservation equa- 
tion (45) is considered, as shown in the next section. 

5.3. Mechanical equilibrium conditions 

This  section  focuses  on  the  derivation  of  mechanical  equilib- 
rium conditions across the interface. The analysis is ﬁrst particu- 
larized for the bicomponent ﬂow depicted in Fig. 1 . The problem 
is  best  illustrated  by  analyzing  a  zoomed-up  view of  a  segment 
of an interface embedded in a much wider thermal mixing layer, 
as sketched in Fig. 17 . The thickness of the mixing layer δ
T grows

cient participates in the conditions addressed in this study, as dis- 
cussed in Section 4.2 . The curvature-related terms in Eqs. (72) and

system,  are  much  smaller than  the terms  involving squared and

are  viscous  stresses.  In  this  formulation,  v I , n = v I · e n  and  v I , s = 
v I · e s  are, respectively, the normal and tangential components of 
the interface absolute velocity, and v n = (v − v I ) · e n is the normal 
component of the relative ﬂuid velocity, with e n and e s being unit 
vectors in the normal and tangential directions, respectively. The 
interface does not slip on the ﬂuid in the tangential direction be- 
cause of the continuity of the tangential velocity. As a result, the 
tangential component of the relative velocity v s = (v − v I ) · e s van- 
ishes in the vicinity of the interface, as depicted in Fig. 17 . 
In general, the absolute velocity of the interface v 

I, n is a func- 
tion  of  time,  and  consequently  the  momentum  Eqs.  (76)  and 
(77) require a ﬁctitious acceleration given by the last term on their 
corresponding right-hand sides. Following experimental analyses of 
interface acceleration in liquid jets at normal pressure [144] , it is 
assumed herein that the characteristic value of the interface accel- 
eration is a fraction of order 1 / R (cid:8) 1 of the convective accelera- 
tion U 2 

O /δT in the shear layer. 

5.3.1. Mechanical equilibrium normal to the interface 

The  transfer  of  heat  into  the  fuel  stream  decreases  the  fuel 
density  near  the  interface  and  produces  an  outwards  ﬂow- 
displacement velocity whose order of magnitude is given by a bal- 
ance between convection and heat conduction across the thermal 
mixing layer,

and the order-unity relative differences of velocities and temper-

The asymptotic limit considered in this analysis corresponds to

lently, (cid:8)
T  being  a  thermal  Cahn  number  deﬁned  in 
Eq. (10) . As the pressure increases, δ
I increases, 
and therefore (cid:8)
T becomes increasingly larger. However, despite the 
high  pressures, (cid:8)
T  always  remains  small  because  of  the  critical- 
point elevation phenomenon discussed in Section 3.2 . 

T decreases and δ

This analysis is limited to two dimensions, although the formu- 
lation can be easily extended to a third dimension by incorporat- 
ing a second curvature. More general multiscale treatments, albeit 
based  on  a  signiﬁcantly  simpler  incompressible  diffuse-interface 
formulation, can be found in Ref. [143] . 

Two different reference frames are sketched in Fig. 17 that are 
relevant for this analysis: the Cartesian laboratory frame { x , y } and 
the curvilinear orthogonal frame { ˆ n , ˆ s } . The latter moves with the 
I . The local curvature inter- 
interface at its local absolute velocity v 
face is denoted as K I = 1 /R I , with K 
I > 0 for interfaces concave to- 
ward the coﬂow (i.e., for interfaces such as the one sketched in the 
upper panel in Fig. 17 ). In all cases of practical interest, the radius 
I . In 
of curvature is much larger than the interface thickness, R 
I relative to δ
contrast, the magnitude of R 
T depends on the partic- 
ular problem under consideration. This scaling analysis considers 
the case in which

is an order-unity parameter. 
Under  the  conditions  (cid:8)

T (cid:8) 1  and  N = O (1) ,  the  interface  is 
slender and the largest variations in all variables are along the nor- 
mal  ˆ n . Consequently, −P GD I + K is diagonally dominant with diag-

cause it will be shown in Section 5.6 that the conditions in the 
vicinity of the interface are near phase equilibrium when the tem- 
perature gradients are not too large. The balance (79) yields the 
thermal-expansion velocity scale

Equation  (97)  is  a  fundamental  mechanical  equilibrium  con- 
dition  that  relates  – locally  through  the  interface  – the  partial- 
density gradients, the thermodynamic pressure, the interface cur- 
vature, and the normal viscous stress. It corresponds to the ﬁrst 
integral of the normal component of the momentum Eq. (76) in 
the moving frame. Evaluation of Eq. (97) at large negative  ˆ n into 
the fuel stream yields the familiar Young-Laplace jump condition

systems.  Physical  interpretations  of  σ based  on  the  excess  of 
the  Landau’s  potential  energy  of  the  interface  are  discussed  in 
Section 5.6.3 . 

5.3.2. Mechanical equilibrium tangential to the interface 

Additional considerations are required in order to normalize Eq. 
(89) . Close to the interface, the tangential relative velocity v s van- 
ishes and its normal gradient ∂ v s /∂ ˆ n is locally a constant of order 
O / δ
U 
T . This motivates the introduction of the dimensionless vari- 
able 
s = v s / ((cid:8)T U O ) .

The  tangential  coordinate  is  normalized  with  the  thermal 

mixing-layer thickness as 
(cid:20) = ˆ s /δT , 
ˆ s 
whereas the units of interface acceleration in the tangential and 
normal directions are assumed to be the same and equal to that 
used  in  Eq.  (88) .  In  the  dimensionless  variables  (81) –(88)  and 
(100) and (101) , the tangential component of the momentum con- 
servation Eq. (77) becomes

Equation (105) is commonly known as the Marangoni effect, and

gential variations of the surface tension. 

5.3.3. The thermodynamic pressure near the interface 

The analyses in Sections 5.3.1 and 5.3.2 highlight the multiscale 
nature  of  the  problem  and  the  corresponding  challenges  associ- 
ated with the integration of the momentum Eq. (45) because of 
the mostly balanced, spatially localized behavior of the gradient- 
dependent pressure and the interfacial stress tensor in the vicinity 
of the interface. The role of the thermodynamic pressure, which 
participates in this balance by linking the mechanical equilibrium 
conditions with the equation of state, is studied in this section. 

Consider the schematics in Fig. 18 (a) depicting the spatial dis- 
tribution of the thermodynamic pressure P around the interface at 
scales much larger than δ
I . The Young-Laplace condition (98) states 
O  on  each  side 
F  and  P 
that  the  local  thermodynamic  pressures  P 
of  the  curved  interface  in  Fig.  18 (a)  differ  from  one  another  by 
amounts of order σ
I . However, this pressure difference is much 
smaller  than  the  combustor  pressure  P ∞  because  R 
I  is  typically 
much  larger  than  σ
0 / P ∞  even  at  high  pressures  (e.g.,  σ0 /P ∞ = 
1 nm at P ∞ = 100 bar in the conditions addressed in Table 4 .). 

0 / R 

The interfacial stresses and the gradient component of the pres- 
I  on both sides away from 

sure are negligible at distances | n | (cid:10) δ
the interface, where the momentum Eq. (45) becomes 

ρ

∂v 
∂t 

+ ρv · ∇v = −∇ p + ∇ · τ. 

(106) 

In Eq. (106) , the thermodynamic pressure P has been replaced by 
a hydrodynamic pressure p by assuming P (cid:7) P ∞ + p. This decom- 
position requires the free-stream Mach numbers Ma O = U O /c O and 
Ma F = U F /c F to be small compared to unity. In the notation, c 
O and 
c 
F  are the speed of the sound waves in the coﬂow and fuel free 
streams, respectively. An expression for the speed of  sound c at 
high pressures, which generally differs from that of an ideal gas, 
is  provided  in  Eq.  (C.48) .  At  small  Mach  numbers,  the  local  de- 
partures of P from its corresponding mean values on each side of

with relative errors of order Ma 2

in mind, and neglecting also the viscous stresses, Eq. (97) becomes

which  indicates  that  the  surface  tension  is  originated  by  a  net 
underpressure  within  the  interface.  Speciﬁcally,  Eq.  (108)  pre- 
dicts  strongly  localized  variations  of  the  thermodynamic  pres- 
sure  of  order  A P ∼ σ
I  within  the  interface,  as  anticipated  in 
Section  4.4  and  shown  schematically  in  Fig.  18 (b).  These  varia- 
tions are always much larger than those engendered by curvature 
by a factor of order 1 / (N (cid:8)T ) (cid:10) 1 , and they are also much larger 
than  the  hydrodynamic  pressure  variations  by  a  factor  of  order

The boundary conditions employed in integrating Eq. (107) cor- 
respond to the fuel partial densities away from the interface. In the 
limit (cid:8)
T (cid:8) 1, it will be shown in Section 5.6 that the temperature 
gradient across the interface is small compared to the composition 
gradient.  To  leading  order  in  (cid:8)
T ,  the  interface  is  in  phase  equi- 
librium and consequently the fuel partial densities tend to their 
phase-equilibrium values on both sides of the interface,

where the limit ˆ n → ±∞ denotes distances much larger than δ

T . In this limit, the relative temperature varia- 
tions across the interface are of order (cid:8)
T , and as a result the tem- 
perature becomes approximately uniform in the vicinity of the in- 
terface. The interface temperature T e evolves with distance down- 
stream, with T e ∼ T 
c ,diff near 
the interface edge. Both phase-equilibrium values Y (cid:2)

therefore evaluated at P ∞  and T e . Because of the locally uniform 
temperature, the normal directional derivative of the Gibbs-Duhem

the interface P F and P O = P ∞ are small. The condition that must be 
satisﬁed for these departures to be larger than the Young-Laplace 
pressure jump σ
I  is that R 
I  must be larger than the capillary 
length  (cid:2) ca = σ0 / (ρO U 2 
O ) .  This  condition  tends  to  be  always  satis- 
ﬁed at high pressures, since (cid:2) ca becomes very small because of the 
large values of density encountered in conjunction with the small 
values of surface tension, as suggested by the estimates provided 
in Table 4 . 

The  above  considerations  suggest  that  the  curvature-related 
terms  in  the  mechanical  equilibrium  condition  (97)  can  be  ne- 
glected with relative errors of order σ

0 /( P ∞ R

It can be shown by using Eqs. (116) –(118) that variations of the 
surface tension coeﬃcient along the interface in multicomponent 
ﬂows give rise to the same tangential mechanical equilibrium con- 
dition (105) as in bicomponent ﬂows.

to small curvatures and Mach numbers, Eq. (118) simpliﬁes to

It is shown in this section that the right-hand side of Eq. (142) is

In  Eqs.  (136) and  (137) ,  the  constant-temperature gradient of 
the chemical potential can be expanded in terms of gradients of 
composition  and  pressure,  as  shown  in  Appendix  F.3 ,  leading  to 
the more familiar representation of these ﬂuxes in Stefan–Maxwell 
form. 

The interfacial corrections to q and J

Similarly to the interfacial stress tensor K , the species and heat 
ﬂuxes J 
i  and Q are also highly localized at the interface, where 
the partial-density gradients multiplied by the gradient-energy co- 
eﬃcients are dynamically relevant quantities. 

The ﬁrst subset of L consists of the single coeﬃcient L q , q , which 
participates in the Fourier conduction component of the standard 
heat ﬂux q . By simple inspection of Eqs. (136) or (F.24) , the coeﬃ- 
cient L q , q can be written as 
L q,q = λT 2 , 
with λ being a thermal conductivity modeled in Appendix F.2 . 
The second subset of L corresponds to the coeﬃcients L 

i , k [i.e., 
dot-dashed line rectangle in Eq. (143) ], which are related to the 
interfacial species ﬂux J 
i in Eq. (139) and to the Fickian compo- 
nent  of  J 
i , k  is  summarized  in 
Appendix F.4 and involves the utilization of Eq. (F.34) relating the 
i , k with the binary diffusion coeﬃcients D 
coeﬃcients L 
i, j modeled 
in Appendix F.5 . For binary mixtures, Eq. (F.34) becomes a scalar 
equation that yields

The  third  subset  of  L  are  the  coeﬃcients  L

the Soret and Dufour effects appearing, respectively, in the stan- 
dard diffusion ﬂuxes of heat q in Eq. (136) and species J 
i  in Eq. 
(137) [see also Eqs. (F.24) and (F.25) for the corresponding Stefan–
Maxwell forms of these ﬂuxes]. In particular, the coeﬃcients L

calculated as 
s F − s O = ( h F − h O + μO − μF ) /T 

(151) 

by making use of the deﬁnition (60) . Alternatively, based on the 
analysis outlined in Section F.3 , q and J F can be recast in traditional 
Stefan–Maxwell form as

as shown by evaluating Eqs. (F.24) and (F.25) for N = 2 and utiliz- 
ing Eqs. (145) and (146) . Despite the fact that the Stefan-Maxwell 
forms (152) and (153) are more insightful than their unexpanded 
counterparts (149) and (150) , their utilization in transcritical ﬂows 
is  not  advantageous  when  the  combustor  pressure  is  not  suﬃ- 
ciently high and the system crosses the mechanical spinodals. In 
those conditions, singularities arise in the non-ideal diffusion pref- 
actor ( ∂ ln f 
F ) P , T and in the fuel partial molar volume  ¯V F [de- 
ﬁned in Eq. (B.18) and particularized for the Peng-Robinson equa- 
tion of state in Eq. (C.43) ] that prevent from splitting the constant- 
temperature gradient of chemical potential into barodiffusion and 
Fickian diffusion, as discussed in Appendix E.1 .

5.6. Transport equilibrium condition 

In  a  similar  way  as  the  gradient-dependent  pressure  and  in- 
terfacial stresses are balanced when the interface is in mechanical 
equilibrium, a balance between interfacial ﬂuxes and standard dif- 
fusion ﬂuxes exists when the interface is in transport equilibrium, 
as discussed in this section. 

5.6.1. The transport equilibrium condition in terms of a balance of 
species ﬂuxes 

Consider again the slender interface separating two propellant 
streams in Fig. 17 . The analysis begins by recalling that the char- 
acteristic length of the variation of the temperature downstream 
of  the  injection  oriﬁce  is  the  thickness  of  the  thermal  mixing 
layer δ
T . In contrast, the composition across the interface under- 
goes rapid changes along much smaller distances of the same or- 
der as the interface thickness δI = (cid:8)T δT (cid:8) δT . This large composi- 
tion gradient is due to the suppression of molecular diffusion in 
thermodynamically  unstable  conditions  at  high  pressures,  where 
the standard transport theory predicts antidiffusion of fuel and an 
ever-increasing composition gradient, as discussed in Section 4.6 . 
It will be shown here that a mutual cancellation of the standard 
and interfacial species ﬂuxes occurs at the interface in the limit 
(cid:8)
T (cid:8) 1 corresponding to small temperature gradients compared to 
the composition gradients across the interface. The resulting trans- 
port equilibrium condition provides a quasi-steady thermochemical 
description of the interface structure that is shown schematically 
in Fig. 20 and is elaborated in the remainder of this section. 

The normal components of the species ﬂuxes (148) and (153) ca 

be decomposed as

for C 12 H 26 /N 2 mixtures at (a) P = 50 bar and (b) 100 bar as a function of temper-

sure (purple diamond symbol). (For interpretation of the references to color in this

and to the thermal-diffusion ratio k 
Appendix F.6 . For binary mixtures, Eq. (F.43) simpliﬁes to 
L q, F = ρT D F , O k F , T . 
The distributions of λ, D F , O , and k 
sition are studied in Appendix B.4 for C 
pressures.

The size of the Onsager matrix L in binary mixtures is 2 × 2 
and  its  determinant  is  given  by  det ( L ) = L q,q L F , F − L 2 
q, F .  The  re- 
quirement that L be positive semideﬁnite, and therefore that the 
entropy production source (142) be zero or positive, implies the 
condition det ( L ) ≥ 0 . Numerical evaluations for 15 bar ≤ P ≤ 100 bar 
indicate  that  the  condition  det ( L ) ≥ 0  is  satisﬁed  for  C 
26 /N

mixtures at temperatures 300 K ≤ T ≤ 1000 K as long as the param- 
eter constant ι participating in the calculation of k 
F,T is recalibrated 
within  10%  of  its  standard  value  (see  Appendix  F.6  for  details). 
These considerations are illustrated in Fig. 19 for two representa- 
tive pressures.

In order to isolate the most important terms in Eq. (159) , con- 
sider nondimensionalizing Eq. (159) with the same units as those 
employed to write the momentum Eq. (89) , namely Eqs. (32) and 
(81) –(86) . Additional characteristic scales for the temperature and 
species ﬂuxes are obtained as follows. 

(159) 

For (cid:8)

T (cid:8) 1, the temperature gradient near the interface is locally 
a constant that can be approximated as ∂ T /∂ ˆ n ∼ (T O − T F ) /δT . As a 
result, the variations of the temperature across the interface with 
respect to the interface temperature T e are of order (cid:8)
T relative to 
the temperature difference between the free streams T O − T F . The

The integration of Eq. (174) up to large distances compared with 
the interface thickness involves a constant that corresponds to the 
sum of ﬂuxes J (cid:4) (cid:20)

ˆ n (cid:20) → + ∞ . While the interfacial com- 
ponent of that constant is zero for all practical purposes, the stan- 
dard one J (cid:4) (cid:20) 
F , n | 
ˆ n → + ∞ may not be zero away from the interface, since 
the coﬂow may mix with hot gas-like fuel transferred from the fuel 
side. This large-scale mixing of propellants away from the interface 
is described by the species conservation equation (46) minus the 
interfacial transport term,

where  use  of  Eqs.  (155)  and  (156)  has  been  made,  and  where 
dimensional  variables  have  been  recovered  in  the  notation.  The 
transport equilibrium condition (176) states that the Fickian and 
barodiffusion components of the standard species ﬂux (153) bal- 
ance the portion of the interfacial species ﬂux (148) independent 
of the temperature gradient, as sketched in Fig. 20 . 

The interface temperature T e , which is generally a function of 
time and the tangential coordinate  ˆ s , participates in Eq. (177) as 
demanded by the leading-order asymptotic expansion of the ﬂuxes 
(169) and (170) for (cid:8)
T (cid:8) 1. The temperature ﬁeld around the inter- 
face evolves in time scales of order δ2 
T /D T , O , which are much larger 
than the ﬂow transit time across the interface δ
T . As a result, T e 
is a quantity that varies mostly quasi-steadily at interfacial scales. 
The  boundary  conditions  required  in  the  integration  of  Eq. 
(177)  can  be  summarized  as  follows.  First,  the  local  thermody- 
namic pressure on the coﬂow side of the interface (see Fig. 17 ), 
which can be approximated as the combustor pressure P ∞ at suf- 
ﬁciently small Mach numbers, is recovered by the solution away 
from the interface, 

I / U 

P → P O ∼ P ∞  at  ˆ n → + ∞ . 

(178) 

Second, the fuel partial densities tend to their phase-equilibrium 
values away from the interface,

of the interface,

In  Eq.  (190) , γ IG 
O  is  the  ideal-gas  adiabatic coeﬃcient  deﬁned  in 
Eq.  (C.27) ,  and  ˆ c O = c p , O / c IG 
p , O  is  a  ratio  of  real-to-ideal  speciﬁc 
heats at constant pressure, both parameters being evaluated in the 
coﬂow  stream  (see  Table  4  for  typical  values of γ IG 
O  and  ˆ c O ).  In 
the  vicinity  of  the  interface,  it  can  be  also  shown  that  convec- 
tion of enthalpy, viscous dissipation, pressure advection, curvature- 
related terms, and enthalpy production by interfacial forces in Eq. 
(185) are negligible compared to the normal derivative of the sum 
n + Q (cid:4)

As discussed in Appendix E.1 , the pressures within the inter- 
face may become small enough to cross the mechanical spinodals 
when  the  combustor  pressure  decreases  but  it  is  still  high  rel- 
ative  to  the  atmospheric  value.  In  that  case,  singularities  in  ¯V F 
and  ( ∂ ln f

the Fickian and barodiffusion components into a single ﬁnite term

constant-temperature gradients by ordinary ones because of the lo- 
cally uniform temperature prevailing in the vicinity of the interface 
in the limit (cid:8)
T (cid:8) 1. When expression (191) is used in Eqs. (155) and 
(183) , the scaling analysis performed above does not change in any 
fundamental manner and gives a transport equilibrium condition 
valid over the entire high-pressure range that can be written as

with  the  mechanical  equilibrium  condition  (112)  and  integrated 
once giving the system of equations 

Similarly to the scaling analysis made for the species conserva-

5.6.4. Generalizations to multicomponent systems 

The formulation can be easily generalized to multicomponent 
systems. First, consider the generalized version of the species ﬂux 
balance (176) , namely 
(cid:4) 
(cid:4) 
i,n = 0 , 
i,n + J 
J 

i = 1 , . . . N − 1 . 

(195) 

In multicomponent systems, the species ﬂuxes of the i -th com- 
ponent, Eqs. (139) and (F.25) , depend on the Onsager coeﬃcients 
of N − 1 components, thereby making Eq. (195) of little interest for 
large N . A more useful version of Eq. (195) independent of the On- 
sager coeﬃcients is derived in this section. 

Upon substituting the species ﬂuxes (139) and (F.25) into Eq. 

(195) , the system of N − 1 equations

The concatenation of Eqs. (196) and (198) represents an over-

matrix  L  given  in  Eq.  (143)  excluding  the  ﬁrst  column,  with 
rank ( M ) ≤ N − 1 because L is positive semideﬁnite. In particular, 
rank ( M ) = N − 1 is achieved when L is positive deﬁnite, or equiv- 
alently, when the entropy production (142) is strictly positive. In 
that case, the only possible solution to the over-determined sys-

5.7. Remarks on transcritical interfaces in equilibrium and 
near-equilibrium conditions 

The  dimensionless  parameters  E m  in  Eq.  (95)  and  E s  in  Eq. 
(173) measure, respectively, the tendency of the interface to attain 
mechanical and transport equilibrium. The smaller E m and E s , the 
more equilibrated the interface is. Both E m and E s are proportional 
to the thermal Cahn number (cid:8)
T , or dimensionally, to the tempera- 
ture gradient across to the interface. 

In  isothermal  systems,  the  thermal  Cahn  number  is  exactly 
zero,  (cid:8)T = 0 ,  and  therefore  E m = E s = 0 .  The  interface  is  in  me- 
chanical  and  transport  equilibrium,  in  that  the  variations  of  the 
gradient-dependent pressure are exactly balanced with the varia- 
tions of the interfacial stress normal to the interface, and the sum 
of the standard and interfacial species ﬂuxes is exactly zero. The 
structure  of  the  interface  can  be  described  by  the  combination 
of the mechanical equilibrium condition (120) and the transport 
equilibrium condition (199) , or equivalently, by the system of Eq. 
(202) subject to the phase-equilibrium partial densities (203) and 
(204)  in  the  far  ﬁeld.  The  system  of  Eqs.  (202)  has  been  uti- 
lized in early work addressing interfaces in multicomponent equi- 
librium isothermal systems [17,37,100,109,118,121,131,132] , and can 
be alternatively derived by minimizing the volume integral of the

gradient-dependent  Helmholtz  free  energy  [116,117,120] .  In  addi- 
tion,  the  system  (202)  equivalently  states  that  the  generalized 
chemical potential (cid:2) μ
k given by Eq. (58) remains constant through 
the interface and equal to the phase-equilibrium chemical poten- 
tial  μ
ke .  Correspondingly,  the  sources  of  entropy  related  to  gra- 
dients  of  temperature  and  generalized  chemical  potential  in  Eq. 
(142) are exactly zero in mechanical and transport equilibrium. 

For  the  binary  mixtures  studied  here,  the  system  of  Eqs. 
(202)  simpliﬁes  to  Eqs.  (193)  and  (194)  subject  to  the  bound- 
ary  conditions  (109)  and  (110) .  The  solution  to  that  problem 
is  a  steady  planar  transcritical  interface  bearing  surface  ten- 
sion  and  separating  a  liquid-like  supercritical  mixture  rich  in 
fuel  from  a  gas-like  supercritical  mixture  rich  in  coﬂow  species, 
with  both  mixtures  being  in  phase  equilibrium  as  discussed  in 
Section 6 . 

None of the different forms of the transport equilibrium condi- 
tion [i.e., Eqs. (176) , (177), (182), (192), (199), (200) , and (202) ] de- 
pend on transport coeﬃcients. Similarly, although high-order vis- 
cous effects can be retained in the derivation of the mechanical 
equilibrium condition in Eq. (97) , the leading-order balance is in- 
dependent of viscosity, as suggested by Eqs. (107) , (112) , and (120) . 
As  a  result,  the  internal  structure  of  a  transcritical  interface  in 
mechanical  and  transport  equilibrium  is  independent  of  viscos- 
ity, thermal conductivity, binary diffusion coeﬃcient, and thermal- 
diffusion ratio. 

In non-isothermal systems, the thermal Cahn number is larger 
than zero, although in practical situations it remains small com- 
pared to unity, (cid:8)
T (cid:8) 1, because the temperature gradients created 
by the ﬂow are never as large as the composition gradients across 
the interface. Even in the wake of the oriﬁce ring separating both 
propellant streams in Fig. 1 , where the temperature gradient is the 
largest, the characteristic length for the temperature variations is 
the thickness of the oriﬁce ring, which is always much larger than 
the interface thickness. 

For 0 < (cid:8)

T (cid:8) 1, the mechanical (95) and transport (173) equilib- 
rium parameters attain small but non-zero values, 0 < {E m , E s } (cid:8) 1 . 
As a result, the interface is neither in mechanical equilibrium nor 
in transport equilibrium. However, the departures from equilibrium 
are small, and the equilibrium conditions still describe the overall 
structure of the interface to a good approximation, as discussed in 
Section 7 .  The  interface temperature T e  and the  far-ﬁeld bound- 
ary conditions away from the interface may become functions of 
space and time because of the large-scale evolution of the ﬂow, 
but the characteristic length and time scales of these variations, 
T /D T = t I /(cid:8)T ,  are  much  larger,  respectively,  than 
δT = δI /(cid:8)T  and  δ2 
the interface thickness δ
I and the ﬂow transit time across the in- 
terface t 
I ). As a result, 
the structure of the interface evolves quasi-steadily in response to 
those ﬂow variations, as sketched in Fig. 20 . The complete descrip- 
tion of the evolution of the interface and the ﬂow surrounding it 
requires the Navier-Stokes equations outlined in Section 4.7 sup- 
plemented  with  the  closures  for  interfacial  terms  derived 
above. 

I (see Table 4 for typical values of δ

I and t 

An intermediate case may exist in non-isothermal systems in 
which the interface is much closer to mechanical equilibrium than 
to  transport  equilibrium,  0 < E m (cid:8) E s (cid:8) 1  [e.g.,  E m / E s = O (10 −3 ) 
in the conditions addressed in Table 4 ]. In this case, the species 
conservation equation (46) can be integrated simultaneously with 
the mechanical equilibrium condition (120) . The latter is subject 
to  boundary  conditions  corresponding  to  partial  densities  gener- 
ally  away  from  phase  equilibrium,  and  may  involve  pure  com- 
ponents in the propellant streams. This intermediate case is ad- 
dressed  in  Section  7 .  The  solution  provides  the  spatiotemporal 
evolution of the transcritical interface and the associated surface- 
tension  coeﬃcient  downstream  of  the  injection  oriﬁce,  as  pre- 
viewed in Figs. 2 and 3 .

6. Transcritical interfaces in isothermal bicomponent systems 

12 H 

This section provides numerical results describing steady trans- 
critical interfaces in C 
2 isothermal systems. The conﬁgura- 
tion analyzed here corresponds to the limit of inﬁnitely thick ther- 
mal mixing layers, or equivalently, to the case of zero thermal Cahn 
numbers, (cid:8)T = 0 , in which the interface is in mechanical and trans- 
port equilibrium.

6.1. Formulation 

The equations integrated here are (193) and (194) , which are 
supplemented  with  the  equation  of  state  (14)  and  mixing  rules 
(15)  particularized  for  binary  mixtures  [see  Eq.  (212)  introduced 
below], along with the expressions for the gradient-energy coeﬃ- 
cient  (23) ,  chemical  potential  (B.23) ,  ideal-gas  Gibbs  free  energy 
(C.46) ,  fugacity  coeﬃcient  (C.47) ,  and  the  constants  provided  in 
Table  C.1  and  Appendix  C .  The  boundary  conditions  away  from 
the interface are the phase-equilibrium partial densities (109) and 
(110) . The problem has a steady solution consisting of a thin inter- 
face that bears surface tension and separates a liquid-like C 
26 - 
rich supercritical mixture from a gas-like nitrogen-rich supercriti- 
cal mixture. A summary of the formulation is provided in Table 5 . 
Details  associated  with  the  numerical  integration  of  these  equa- 
tions are discussed in Appendix G . 

12 H 

The calculations focus on the four cases summarized in Table 6 . 
In all cases, the thermodynamic pressure away from the interface 
P ∞ = 50 − 100 bar is larger than the critical pressures of the in- 
dividual  components,  while  the  temperature  T e = 350 − 500  K  is 
smaller  than  both  the  fuel  critical  temperature  T c, F = 658  K  and 
the temperature of the diffusional critical point T 
c ,diff at the cor- 
responding  pressure  (i.e.,  see  Table  3 ).  As  a  result,  the  pseudo- 
trajectories  along  the  interface  in  thermodynamic  space  traverse 
the  coexistence  region,  as  shown  in  Fig.  21 .  Furthermore,  while 
case  D  only  involves  crossings  of  the  diffusional  spinodal,  cases 
A, B, and C involve crossings of both diffusional and mechanical 
spinodals. It is therefore convenient to use the combined mechan- 
ical and transport equilibrium conditions written in terms of gra- 
dients of chemical potentials (193) and (194) , since, as explained 
in Appendix E.1 , these forms are unaffected by singularities arising 
in the fuel  partial molar volume  and non-ideal diffusion prefac- 
tor near the mechanical spinodals. It is also in cases A, B, and C 
where the thermodynamic pressure reaches negative values within 
the interface. This effect is inconsequential because the formula- 
tion in Table 5 is independent of the transport coeﬃcients. 

6.2. Results: the steady transcritical interface 

The proﬁles of density, fuel mass fraction, and thermodynamic 
pressure across the interface are shown in Fig. 22 (a–c). Density ra- 
tios of order R ∼ 13 (for cases A and C at P ∞ = 50 bar) and R ∼ 7 
(for  cases  B  and  D  at  P ∞ = 100  bar)  are  observed  in  the  solu- 
tion  that  are  spatially  localized and  accompanied by  order-unity 
variations of the fuel mass fraction in accordance with the phase- 
equilibrium composition on each side of the interface. In particular, 
on the fuel side of the interface, the mixtures are rich in C 
26 
and  have  compressibility  factors  within  the  range  Z ∼ 0.30–0.75, 
which  clearly  depart  from  the  ideal  behavior  corresponding  to 
unity. The oscillation of the pressure across the coexistence region 
is localized near the fuel side of the interface, where an under- 
pressure of order unity relative to P ∞ occurs. It will be shown that 
this large underpressure leads to signiﬁcant values of surface ten- 
sion in accord with Eq. (108) . In contrast, on the other side of the 
interface, the mixture is rich in N 
2 and much less dense. The corre- 
sponding compressibility factors are within the range Z ∼ 1.01–1.03, 
thereby indicating that the ﬂuid approaches there the behavior of

is highly supercritical in temperature. 

A point-wise cancellation between the standard and interfacial 
ﬂuxes of species is observed within the interface in Fig. 22 (d). Pos- 
itive values of the standard diffusion ﬂux J 
F (i.e., in the direction of 
decreasing fuel concentration) are observed on both ﬂanks of the 
interface, whereas negative values (i.e., in the direction of increas- 
ing fuel concentration) occur inside. 

A  detailed  breakdown  of  the  species  ﬂuxes  is  provided  in 
Fig.  23 (a)  for  case  D.  In  the  diffusionally  unstable  region  of  the 
interface,  the  Fickian  component  of  the  species  ﬂux  antidiffuses 
fuel in the direction of increasing concentration, as anticipated in 

Section 4.6 . In contrast, the barodiffusion component acts in the 
opposite direction by transporting fuel along the positive pressure 
gradient, albeit with less intensity than the Fickian component. As 
a result, the standard species ﬂux J 
F  is dominated by Fickian an- 
tidiffusion within the interface, with zero-ﬂux points J F = 0 being 
coincident with the diffusional-spinodal states given by the max- 
imum  and  minimum locations  of  the  fuel  chemical  potential,  as 
shown in Fig. 23 (b). 

No  steady  solution  of  the  problem  exists  for  κF , F = 0  (i.e., 
J F = 0 ). Speciﬁcally, κF , F = 0 would impede the balance shown in 
Fig.  23 (a)  between  the  interfacial  species  ﬂux  J F  and  the  stan- 
F . The interfacial species ﬂux J F provides the necessary 
dard one J 
amount of positive transport of fuel, in the direction of decreasing 
fuel concentration, to yield a ﬁnite-thickness interface that persists 
indeﬁnitely in time.

However,  because  of  the  high  pressures  attainable  in  the  co- 
existence  region  of  hydrocarbon-fueled  mixtures,  the  associated 
Knudsen  numbers  Kn I ∼ 0 . 02 − 0 . 15  are  relatively  smaller  here 
[see  Fig.  24 (b)],  and  can  be  made  arbitrarily  smaller  by  further 
increasing  the  pressure,  or  by  increasing  the  temperature,  with 
I → 0 as the pressure or temperature conditions approach those 
Kn 
of  the  diffusional  critical  point.  As  a  result,  the  continuum  hy- 
pothesis  underlying  the  present  diffuse-interface  theory  may  be 
much more appropriate in transcritical bicomponent systems than 
in subcritical monocomponent ones. 

The  surface  tension  coeﬃcient  σ computed  from  Eq.  (99)  is 
shown  in  Fig.  25 (a).  Despite  the  high  pressures,  the  predicted 
values  of  σ are  dynamically  signiﬁcant  over  a  wide  tempera- 
ture  range.  They  amount  to  30–40%  of σ of  water  in  air  at  at- 
mospheric  pressure.  Discrepancies  of  10–20%  are  observed  be- 
tween these calculations and experimental measurements of σ in 
diesel/nitrogen interfaces reported in Ref. [15] [e.g., σ (50 bar, 308,

across the interface decrease, thereby causing a decrease in σ , as 
shown in Fig. 25 (a). In particular, the surface tension vanishes and 
δ
I diverges to inﬁnity when T e equals the temperature of the diffu- 
c ,diff at P = P ∞ . Steady transcritical interfaces

The limiting value for the temperature above which transcrit-

ferent from the ones engendered by the hydrocarbon-fueled mix-

Transcritical  interfaces  persist  even  after  large  increments  in 
pressure.  As  shown  in  Fig.  25 (b),  at  ﬁxed  temperatures  of  prac- 
tical interest, T e = 350–500 K, transcritical interfaces survive until 
pressures P ∞ ∼ 60 0–120 0 bar, above which the coexistence region 
disappears and the mixture becomes fully supercritical.

In  isothermal  systems,  the  constant-temperature  gradient  of

Equation (209) is a generalized multicomponent version of the 
original Cahn-Hilliard equation derived in Ref. [109] for binary sys- 
tems near the critical point. In contrast to Ref. [109] , no assump- 
tion of a simpliﬁed predetermined form of the difference of chem- 
ical potentials μ
k − μN  has been made here. Instead, the chemi- 
cal potentials are described exactly by Eqs. (B.22) , (B.23) , and by 
Eq. (C.47) for the Peng-Robinson equation of state (14) . Setting the 
right-hand side of the generalized Cahn-Hilliard Eq. (209) to zero 
gives the transport equilibrium condition (200) . That is an unde- 
termined  system  of  N − 1  equations  that  needs  to  be  combined 
with  the  mechanical  equilibrium  condition  (121)  and  integrated 
once to yield the determined system of N Eq. (202) , as described 
in Section 5.6.4 . 

Numerical simulations employing diffuse-interface frameworks 
in CFD codes have been aimed at predicting complex two-phase 
ﬂows at near-atmospheric pressures [145–148] . Those simulations 
employ ad-hoc versions of Eq. (209) to avoid numerical smearing 
of the interface [e.g., see Eq. (57) in Ref. [147] ]. Key assumptions 
made in those formulations are: 
(a) P and ρ are uniform through the interface. 
(b) L 
(c) The standard component of the species ﬂux is approximated by

(d) The  order  of  the  Cahn-Hilliard  equation  is  dropped  twice  to 
make it second order, and therefore numerically more manage- 
able. 

It is shown in this section that approximations (a), (b), and (c) in- 
cur large errors in the predictions of this theory unless the condi- 
tions are very close to the diffusional critical point. Approximation 
(d) does not bear any physical justiﬁcation.

A constant-pressure approximation P ≈ P ∞ in Eq. (211) becomes 
appropriate only at suﬃciently high pressures near the diffusional 
2  mixtures at uniform temperature of 
critical point. For C 
500 K, the pressure at the diffusional critical point is 688 bar, as 
shown in Fig. A.1 . On approach to the diffusional critical point at 
that  temperature,  the  pressure  parameter  P deﬁned  in  Eq.  (38) , 
corresponding to the ratio of the characteristic amplitude of the 
pressure oscillation through the interface to the combustor pres- 
sure,  is  P = 4 · 10 −3 ,  8 · 10 −4 ,  1 · 10 −4 ,  and  6 · 10 −7  at  P ∞ = 500 , 
600, 650, and 685 bar, respectively. As a result, the thermodynamic 
pressure becomes increasingly more uniform near the diffusional 
critical point.

The equation of state (14) with ﬁxed P = P ∞ and T = T e makes 
the  density  an  implicit  function  of  the  fuel  mass  fraction,  ρ = 
ρ(Y F ) . However, the density variations across the interface decrease 
as the diffusional critical point is approached. For C 
2 mix- 
tures at uniform temperature of 500 K, the relative density varia-

tions across the interface are (ρ(cid:2) 
e = 37% , 24%, 15%, and 4% 
at P ∞ = 500 , 600, 650, and 685 bar, respectively. These variations 
decrease with pressure at a much slower rate than the pressure 
variations.

As shown in Fig. 23 , the standard species ﬂux engenders antid- 
iffusive transport of fuel species within the diffusionally unstable 
zone of the interface, and forward diffusion everywhere else. The 
slope of the chemical-potential difference must therefore change 
F  axis. An approximate model for μF − μO

The  model  ˆ σ leads  to  large  errors  with  respect  to  the  exact

fraction  proﬁles  in  Fig.  27 (b)  get  ampliﬁed  when  they  are  dif- 
ferentiated, squared, and integrated to obtain  ˆ σ . For instance, at 
P ∞ = 500 bar and T e = 500 K, the model predicts  ˆ σ = 1 . 0 mN/m, 
while the exact calculation gives σ = 1 . 5 mN/m. Similar errors are 
observed for all tested pressures up to 685 bar. Additional short- 
falls  of  the  model  expressions  (218) –(220)  are  that  their  deriva- 
tion does not involve the equation of state (14) nor the mechanical 
equilibrium condition (107) . Near the diffusional critical point, it 
is however plausible that Eq. (107) simpliﬁes to P ≈ P ∞ with rela- 
tive errors of order P (cid:8) 1 . In contrast, the equation of state (14) is 
F once P , T , and ρ are set 
strictly incompatible with variations in Y

7. Transcritical interfaces in non-isothermal bicomponent 
systems 

12 H 

This  section  provides  numerical  results  describing  unsteady 
transcritical interfaces in C 
2  non-isothermal systems. This 
26 /N 
conﬁguration  corresponds  to  small  but  non-zero  thermal  Cahn 
numbers, 0 < (cid:8)
T (cid:8) 1. In this limit, which is perhaps the one that 
has the most practical interest, temperature gradients exist across 
the interface that are however small compared to the composition 
gradients. 

7.1. Formulation 

The temperature gradient across the interface changes funda- 
mentally the solution with respect to that described in Section 6 . 
Here, T e varies along the interface, and therefore the structure of 
the  interface  evolves  with  distance  downstream  of  the  injection 
oriﬁce.  The  spatial  functionality  of  T e  is  determined  by  the  rate 
of  heat  transfer  across  the  interface.  The  solution  provides  the 
size of the transcritical region, within which the interface survives, 
and where σ attains values of practical relevance before vanish- 
ing at the interface edge. The transcritical interface is away from 
equilibrium,  although  the  departures  are  small,  as  discussed  in 
Section 5.7 . The problem must be solved using the Navier-Stokes 
equations in Section 4.7 , along with the closures for the interfa- 
cial stress K and interfacial ﬂuxes J F and Q provided in Section 5 . 
The numerical simulation of the problem sketched in Fig. 1 is not 

Fig. 27.  Comparison between modeled (blue dashed lines) and exact (dark solid 
lines)  proﬁles  of  (a)  dimensionless  chemical-potential  difference  in  C 12 H 26 /N 2 
isothermal  systems  at  T e = 500  K  and  different  pressures,  and  (b)  correspond- 
ing mass fractions as a function of distance normalized with the interface thick- 
ness computed using Eq. (208) based on the exact solution ( δI = 6 . 8 nm, 9.9 nm, 
16.4 nm, and 62.3 nm for P ∞ = 500 , 600, 650, and 685 bar, respectively). To ob- 
tain these proﬁles, the coeﬃcient  ˆ A μ in Eq. (215) has been calibrated as  ˆ A μ = 
391 . 8 kJ/kg, 344.4 kJ/kg, 323.5 kJ/kg, and 313.2 kJ/kg for P ∞ = 500 , 600, 650, and 
685 bar, respectively. Similarly, the equilibrium densities on the liquid-like side are

maximum value of (211) evaluated at P = P ∞ . However, the ampli- 
tude match occurs at increasingly dissimilar fuel mass fractions as 
the pressure decreases, since the exact proﬁle of μF − μO becomes 
increasingly asymmetric. 

The good agreement between the model and the exact expres- 
sion  (211)  at  high  pressures  in  Fig.  27 (a)  translates  into  corre- 
spondingly good predictions of the spatial distribution of fuel, with 
discrepancies with the numerical results subsiding with increasing 
pressures, as observed in Fig. 27 (b). An expression for Y F ( ˆ n ) can be 
derived from the model (215) by integrating twice the right-hand 
side of Eq. (210) , subject to zero gradients and phase-equilibrium 
conditions away from the interface, giving

Equation (216) can be integrated once more by using the identity

exists in which the streawmise velocity remains equal to U every- 
where. In this way, time and space can be used interchangeably in 
the equations of motion by means of the relation 

t = x/U. 

(221) 

The origins t = 0 and x = 0 are chosen such that the initial mate- 
rial surface coincides with the ﬂuid state of the propellants at the 
injection plane. Using Eq. (221) , the characteristic supercriticaliza- 
tion length (13) can be alternatively expressed as the time scale 

t TR = L TR /U, 

(222) 

which is used for normalization of the results. 

The  formulation  integrated  in  this  section  is  summarized  in 
Table  8 ,  where  t  plays  the  role  of  the  streamwise  marching  co- 
ordinate  x  in  accordance  with  Eq.  (221) .  Listed  in  Table  8  are 
the  conservation  equations  (44),  (46)  and  (47) ,  along  with  the 
species  and  heat  ﬂuxes  (148),  (147),  (150) ,  and  (152) .  The  me- 
chanical equilibrium condition (107) is employed in place of the 
full momentum Eq. (45) . These equations are supplemented with 
the equation of state (14) and the mixing rules (212) , along with 
the  expressions  for  the  speciﬁc  gradient-dependent  internal  en- 
ergy (17) , gradient-energy coeﬃcient (23) , total energy (48) , spe- 
ciﬁc  entropy  (151) ,  fuel  molar  fraction  (213) ,  mean  molecular 
weight (214) , enthalpy (B.9) , partial enthalpy (B.12) , chemical po- 
tential (B.19) and (B.20) , volume expansivity (C.22) , enthalpy de- 
parture function (C.23) , ideal-gas partial enthalpies (C.33) , partial- 
enthalpy  departure  function  (C.34) ,  partial  molar  volume  (C.43) , 
ideal-gas Gibbs free energies (C.46) , fugacity coeﬃcient (C.47) , and 
the associated constants and supplementary expressions provided 
in Appendix C . Effects of shear and interface roll-up require the 
consideration of streamwise transport and interface curvature. Al- 
though these effects are not included in this section, they are ac- 
counted for in the general formulation provided in Sections 4.7 and 
5 . 

The  thermal  conductivity,  binary  diffusion  coeﬃcient,  and 
thermal-diffusion ratio are calculated using Eqs. (F.13) , (F.36) , and 
(F.43) ,  respectively,  along  with  the  supplementary  relations  in 
Appendix  F .  Those  expressions  are  evaluated  at  P = P ∞ ,  as  dis- 
cussed in Appendix E.2 . In addition, the regularization (E.8) intro- 
duced in Appendix E.1 is employed here to maintain ﬁnite values 
of the difference of partial speciﬁc enthalpies h F − h O  and of the 
volume expansivity βv , since both would otherwise diverge across 
the mechanical spinodal surface. Speciﬁcally, Eq. (E.8) is used with 
m = 0 . 01 from x = 0 (or t = 0 ) until a distance x (or time t ) where 
T e  becomes larger than the corresponding temperature threshold 
provided in Fig. E.1 at the operating pressure (i.e., T e > 480 K at 
P ∞ = 100 bar).  A  sweep in the  regularization constant m  is  per- 
formed in Appendix E.1 that suggests negligible inﬂuences on the 
streamwise evolution of σ , as shown in Fig. E.4 . 

The boundary condition far away from the axis ( ˆ n → + ∞ ) cor- 
responds to the coﬂow temperature T = T O and composition Y F = 0 . 
A symmetry boundary condition is used at the axis  ˆ n = 0 , where

thickness δ
F involves signiﬁcant numerical 
stiffness, as discussed in Section 4.7 . A number of simpliﬁcations 
outlined below are employed in order to facilitate the analysis. 

I and the oriﬁce radius R 

The  conﬁguration  studied  in  this  section  is  summarized  in 
Fig. 28 and corresponds to a simpler version of that depicted in 
Fig. 1 . This conﬁguration does however serve to illustrate the de- 
velopment  and  disappearance  of  the  transcritical  interface  in  a 
manner qualitatively analogous to that sketched in Fig. 1 . The two 
propellant  streams  are  injected  at  the  same  velocity  U  creating 
a  slender,  planar,  laminar  thermal  mixing  layer  at  a  moderately 
high Péclet number Pe R = UR F /D T , O (cid:10) 1 . The transcritical interface 
separating both propellant streams remains hydrodynamically thin 
and slender until it vanishes downstream at an edge, where the 
transverse  velocity,  which  is  of  the  same  order  as  the  thermal- 
expansion velocity scale U 
T  deﬁned in Eq. (80) , is much smaller 
than U by a factor of order 1 / (Pe R R ) (cid:8) 1 . Because of this slender- 
ness, the transversal coordinate y and the coordinate normal to the 
interface ˆ n are approximately equal, y (cid:7) ˆ n . The Marangoni effect is 
neglected for simplicity.

The presence of the interface complicates the characterization 
of the initial conditions, which may otherwise be calculated from 
the self-similar solution of the conservation equations near the ori- 
F (cid:8) 1 and ˆ n /R F ∼ 1 , when the thickness of the separating 
ﬁce at x / R 
plate is also neglected. This procedure is not attempted here be- 
cause  of  the  relatively  unknown  character  of  the  formulation  in 
Table 8 at present time, and is deferred to future work. Instead, 
at t = 0 (or x = 0 ), the initial conditions for the density and fuel 
mass fraction are assumed to be hyperbolic tangents centered at 
ˆ n = R F , whereas that of the temperature has a wider support and 
is centered at  ˆ n = R e > R F , as formulated in Table 8 . The origin of 
the temperature proﬁle R e is chosen such that the initial value of 
the interface temperature, denoted by T 0 
e , is initially imposed at 
ˆ n = R F . Speciﬁcally, the value of T 0

and is assumed to be closer to the fuel temperature than to the 
coﬂow one because of the much smaller thermal diffusivity of the 
fuel stream. The parameters δ0

density and fuel mass fraction are such that the resulting initial 
value of the interface thickness δ0

the  isothermal  case  at  T = T 0

These results ratify the analysis in Section 5.6 , in that most of 
the interfacial species ﬂux is invested in counteracting the antid- 
iffusion of fuel induced by the sum of Fickian and barodiffusion 
mechanisms, whereas most of the interfacial heat ﬂux is invested 
in counteracting the Dufour effect. The small remainders of those 
cancellations,  along  with  the  components  of  the  standard  ﬂuxes 
that are dependent on temperature gradients (Soret, Fourier, and 
interdiffusion), describe the transport of mass and energy across 
the interface in non-equilibrium conditions. 

TR (cid:3) T 

The near-equilibrium behavior persists until the interface van- 
ishes downstream at an edge. Because of the much smaller ther- 
mal diffusivity of the fuel, D T , F /D T , O = 0 . 03 , the cold fuel stream 
cools down the hot coﬂow more than what the hot coﬂow is ca- 
pable  of  heating  the  fuel  stream,  as  observed  in  the  large-scale 
view of the temperature ﬁeld in Fig. 31 . As a result, all isotherms, 
including the supercriticalization one T 
c ,diff, are initially dis- 
placed  outwards  away  from  the  axis  into  the  coﬂow.  This  phe- 
nomenon is exacerbated by a mixing-induced augmentation of the 
constant-pressure speciﬁc heat c p , whose global maximum is at- 
tained within the interface for a signiﬁcant portion of its length or 
lifetime, as shown in Fig. 33 . The line joining the global maxima of 
c p  is the physical-space representation of the pseudo-boiling line 
discussed in Section 2.2 and Appendix B.2 . Similarly to the abrupt 
termination of the pseudo-boiling line observed before intercept- 
ing the diffusional critical point in the C 
2 phase diagram in 
Fig. 10 (c), the global maximum of c p in physical space in Fig. 33 (a) 
ceases to be within the interface upstream of the interface edge, 
and switches abruptly thereafter to the jet axis. 

26 /N 

12 H 

As the fuel is heated by the hot coﬂow, the supercriticalization 
isotherm eventually turns back toward the jet axis and crosses the 
transcritical interface. It is at that crossing point where the inter- 
face vanishes at an edge. The latter is located at a distance of or- 
der unity from the oriﬁce when normalized with the characteris- 
tic supercriticalization length (13) [or after a time of order unity 
has passed when normalized with the characteristic supercritical- 
ization time (222) ], as shown in Figs. 32 and 33 . 

A zoomed view of the structure of the interface edge is pro- 
vided in Fig. 2 . For C 
2 systems, the diffusional critical point 
at the combustor pressure P ∞ = 100 bar plays a central role at the 
interface edge because of the following reasons: 

26 /N 

12 H 

(a) Whereas  the  thermodynamic  pressure  undergoes  order-unity 
oscillations across the interface in the near-equilibrium region, 
the ﬂow in the vicinity of the interface edge is characterized by 
being mostly isobaric at P (cid:3) P ∞ . 

(b) The  isocontour Y 

Fc , diff = 0 . 85 ,  corresponding  to  the  fuel  mass 
fraction of the diffusional critical point at 100 bar (see Table 3 ), 
must necessarily emanate from within the transcritical interface 
since it is engendered in the coexistence region of the thermo- 
dynamic phase diagram, as shown in Fig. 10 (c). 
(c) The  temperature  of  the  diffusional  critical  point  T 

is  the 

c ,diff

maximum temperature of the diffusionally unstable region. 

As discussed in Sections 3.2 and 6.2 , different mixtures may ex- 
ist that may lead to a maximum value of the diffusional spinodal 
surface that may be larger than the diffusional critical temperature. 
In those mixtures, the supercriticalization isotherm would corre- 
spond  to  the  maximum  temperature  of  the  diffusional  spinodal 
surface, and the diffusional critical point would not be located at 
the interface edge, but at some distance upstream within the tran- 
scritical interface. 

Downstream  of  the  interface  edge,  the  temperature  is  every- 
c ,diff, and consequently the system becomes dif- 

where larger than T

interface thickness δI and the thermal mixing-layer thickness δT are computed, re- 
spectively, using Eqs. (223) and (224) . The interface temperature T e is computed 
as the temperature where the absolute value of the fuel partial-density gradient 
∂ (ρY F ) /∂ ˆ n attains its maximum value. 

7.2. Results: The evolution of a transcritical interface downstream of 
the injection oriﬁce 

The  slowly  growing  values  of  (cid:8)R  in  Fig.  29 (a)  indicate  that 
the large composition gradients persist until the interface edge is 
neared. In contrast, the temperature gradient across the interface 
becomes increasingly smaller as the thermal mixing layer grows, 
thereby leading to decreasingly small values of (cid:8)
T for most of the 
length or  lifetime of  the  interface.  The  interface temperature T e , 
shown  in  Fig.  29 (b),  increases  monotonically  because  the  fuel  is 
increasingly heated by the hot coﬂow as it ﬂows downstream of 
the injection oriﬁce. Near the interface edge, where the interface 
approaches the supercriticalization temperature T 
c ,diff, the in- 
terface thickness increases sharply, becoming more than 100 times 
thicker than its initial value δ0 
I , and causing a noticeable increase 
in both (cid:8)R and (cid:8)

TR (cid:3) T 

T . 

The  bathtub-like  shape  of  the  evolution  of  the  thermal  Cahn 
number (cid:8)
T  in Fig. 29 (a) indicates that the interface is closest to 
transport  equilibrium  in  the  intermediate  region  away  from  the 
oriﬁce (where the temperature gradients are the largest) and away 
from the interface edge (where the composition gradients are the 
smallest). The near-equilibrium behavior in that intermediate re- 
gion  is  manifested  in  Figs.  30 (a,b)  as  almost-complete  cancella- 
tions between the components of the standard ( q (cid:4) 
n ) and interfacial 
( Q (cid:4) 
n ) heat ﬂuxes independent of the temperature gradient [see Eqs. 
(183) and (184) ], and between the corresponding components of 
the standard ( J (cid:4) 
F , n ) species ﬂuxes [ Eqs. (155) 
and (156) ]. In contrast,  Fig. 30 (c)  shows that  the  standard ( q (cid:7)T 
n  ) 
and interfacial ( Q (cid:7)T 
n  ) components of the heat ﬂuxes that depend 
on  the  temperature  gradient  [ Eqs.  (186)  and  (187) ]  do  not  can- 
cel each other,  but  are much smaller than their counterparts q (cid:4)

fusionally stable. The interfacial ﬂuxes of heat and species become 
negligible, and the standard diffusion ﬂux of fuel reverses to the 
usual  forward  direction  along  decreasing  fuel  concentrations,  as 
shown in Fig. 34 . The transcritical interface morphs into a fully su- 
percritical mixing layer that grows with distance downstream and 
is characterized by unimpeded mixing of the propellants by molec- 
ular diffusion, as observed in Fig. 2 . In this zone, both propellants 
resemble supercritical gas-like ﬂuids. 

The  evolution  of  the  pseudo-trajectories  of  the  system  with 
distance (or time) are overlaid in Fig. 35 on a T − Y F  thermody- 
namic phase diagram evaluated at P = P ∞ . As the edge conditions 
are approached, Fig. 35 shows that the thermodynamic states of 
the mixture across the interface tend to intersect the coexistence 
region  at  increasingly  higher  temperatures  until  the  diffusional 
critical temperature is reached, above which intersections cannot 
occur. 

As  indicated  by  the  solid  line  in  Fig.  36 ,  the  surface-tension 
coeﬃcient σ , obtained from Eq. (99) , decays monotonically with 
downstream distance (or time) and vanishes simultaneously with 

the  interface  at  the  edge.  The  ﬁrst  stage  of  the  decay  is  from 
t/t TR = x/ L TR = 0 to 0.3, and is characterized by a rapid increase of 
the interface temperature near the oriﬁce, as shown in Fig. 29 (b). 
The decay of σ slows down from t/t TR = x/ L TR = 0 . 3 to 1.5, where 
near-equilibrium transport conditions are attained. Beyond t/t TR = 
x/ L TR = 1 . 5 , the decay rate increases on approach to the diffusional 
critical point, with σ plunging at the interface edge to dynamically 
irrelevant values. 

An  accurate  prediction  of σ ,  given  by  the  square  symbols  in 
Fig. 36 , can be obtained by solving an isothermal interface at ev- 
ery  time  step  using  the  formulation  in  Table  6  and  the  set-up 
described  Section  6 ,  where  the  local  interface  temperature  T e  is 
obtained from Fig. 29 (b). This observation is consistent with the 
attainment of near-equilibrium conditions for most of the trans- 
critical region. Most importantly, it also suggests a potential route 
for  subgrid-scale  modeling  of  transcritical  ﬂows  based  on  pre- 
tabulation of equilibrium isothermal cases, with T e acting as a table 
input obtained from a coarse-grained calculation of the tempera- 
ture ﬁeld.

8. Concluding remarks 

Despite  the  remarkable  progress  made  on  augmenting  the 
thrust,  range,  and  reliability  of  chemical  propulsion  technologies 
over the last several decades, which has often relied on large in- 
vestments in experimentation and testing, the fundamental ﬂuid 
mechanical  processes  participating  in  the  injection,  atomization, 
vaporization, mixing, and combustion of propellants at high pres- 
sures  remain  largely  unknown.  Speciﬁcally,  the  extreme  pres- 
sure  conditions  involved  in  the  transcritical  ﬂow  of  propellants 
into combustors make this problem quite formidable compared to 
many other open questions in the technical discipline of general 
multiphase ﬂows. 

The  present  study  has  focused  on  a  selected  number  of  ba- 
sic aspects of the problem of transcriticality. Particular emphasis 

has been made on describing thermodynamically complex systems 
involving two components at high pressures. When the pressure 
is  supercritical  with  respect  to  both  components,  and  when  at 
least one of the propellants is injected at subcritical temperature, 
transcritical conditions develop that appear to lead to atomization 
and spray phenomena according to existing experimental visual- 
izations. 

The  process  of  interface  formation  at  high  pressures  cannot 
be explained using the thermodynamics of monocomponent sys- 
tems,  since  only  one  thermodynamic  state  is  possible  in  those 
when the temperature is ﬁxed at supercritical pressures. In con- 
trast, in bicomponent systems, at least two states may be possible 
at a given temperature for pressures above the critical pressures 
of  the  separate  components.  Using  previously  well-established 
high-pressure  equations  of  state  and  mixing  rules,  it  is  shown

higher pressures than the critical pressures of the separate com-

ponents in systems of heavy-hydrocarbon fuels mixed with N 
or air. 

2 , O 

At high pressures, the thermodynamic structure of the coexis- 
tence region is dominated by diffusional instabilities. Speciﬁcally, 
the components tend to separate in the coexistence region because 
of an antidiffusion process that proves energetically favorable. In 
ordinary practice, systems like water brought into the coexistence 
region  of  their  thermodynamic  phase  diagram  at  standard  pres- 
sure tend to separate into different phases, namely liquid and va- 
por, across an interface. However, at high pressures, the phases are 
no longer vapor and liquid, but two supercritical ﬂuids of distinct 
character which, in the transcritical conditions addressed in this 
study, behave at injection as a liquid-like supercritical ﬂuid (for the 
heavy hydrocarbon fuel) and a gas-like supercritical ﬂuid (for N

tioned diffusional instability into an observable process in physi- 
cal space is nothing short of laborious. Such translation requires a 
tight connection between the thermodynamic space and the trans- 
port of the propellants in physical space, and must therefore in- 
volve  ﬁnite-rate  processes  of  molecular  diffusion  that  cannot  be 
described  with  the  standard  transport  theory.  This  work  has  in- 
vestigated  one  possible  way  of  addressing  this  question  by  cou- 
pling an extension of the diffuse-interface theory of van der Waals 
ﬂows with the Navier-Stokes conservation equations. The core of 
this  theory  is  the  folding  of  the  coexistence  region  in  thermo- 
dynamic  space  into  a  thin  interface  in  physical  space.  This  can 
only  be  made  possible  by  redeﬁning  the  thermodynamic  poten- 
tials in the presence of strong composition gradients, and by re- 
visiting  the  constitutive  laws  participating  in  the  Navier-Stokes 
conservation  equations.  When  these  modiﬁcations  are  coupled 
with  a  high-pressure  equation  of  state  that  reproduces  a  single

Maxwell loop within the coexistence region, the formulation can 
describe  separation  or  mixing  of  phases  or  ﬂuids  in  accordance 
with  their  thermodynamic  phase  diagram.  The  ensuing  interface 
has  a  non-zero  thickness  set  by  the  nearly  mutual  cancellation 
between  an  antidiffusion  ﬂux  of  matter  provided  by  the  stan- 
dard transport theory, and an opposing interfacial ﬂux arising as 
a  regularization  introduced  by  the  diffuse-interface  theory.  The 
formulation  is  not  exempt  of  approximations,  among  which  the 
most  notable  one  is  related  to  the  continuum  hypothesis  across 
the  interface.  This  is  a  comfortable  approximation  only  at  high 
pressures because the interface broadens relative to intercollision 
distances. 

The  theory  of  transcritical  ﬂows  outlined  in  this  work  in- 
corporates  high-pressure  models  for  thermophysical  and  trans- 
port  properties.  Those  are  subject  to  large  uncertainties,  and 
their  determination  through  analysis  or  experiments  is  a  broad 
and active area of research. Furthermore, the formulation has in- 
troduced  additional  parameters  in  the  form  of  gradient-energy 
coeﬃcients  that  are  directly  related  to  the  thickness  and  sur- 
face  tension  of  the  interface.  Most  of  the  existing  mod- 
els  for  these  coeﬃcients  rely  on  experimental  calibration.  Re-

uncertainties. 

The utilization of this theory has discovered quantitative infor- 
mation  about  the  dynamics  of  transcritical  interfaces  in  coﬂow- 
ing  conﬁgurations  consisting  of  two  propellant  streams  injected 
at different temperatures. The interface separating both propellant 
streams, along with the surface tension it engenders, survive from 
the injection oriﬁce until a supercriticalization zone downstream, 
where the interface vanishes at an edge upon reaching the temper- 
ature of the diffusional critical point. The latter plays a prominent 
role at the interface edge in the C 
2  systems tested here. 
Speciﬁcally, the interface edge is characterized by a fundamental 
transition in the transport characteristics of the mixture that pre-

mixing layer ensues from the interface edge, across which the pro- 
pellants mix by molecular diffusion as if they were two gas-like 
ﬂuids. 

A central motivation of this study has been to highlight that a 
number of extensions of this theory could be made in order to re- 
lax the simplifying assumptions used in the examples above. These 
extensions  could  include  the  effects  of  turbulence,  which  is  ex- 
pected to play an important role in the transport of heat in practi- 
cal systems at high pressures, and consequently in the determina- 
tion of the supercriticalization length. However, even in the sim- 
ple cases that have been addressed in this work, the description 
of the coupling between the interface structure and the hydrody- 
namic ﬁeld is computationally expensive because of the resulting

interface temperature T e read from Fig. 29 (b).

large disparity of scales. The reader should therefore be forewarned 
that the formulation that has been presented here involves inter- 
facial terms in the conservation equations whose spatiotemporal 
resolution requirements are most likely untenable in CFD simula- 
tions of full engineering systems with current standard hardware 
and numerical methods. 

Worthy  extensions  of  this  work  that  may  decrease  the  com- 
putational  cost  could  involve  investigations  of  ﬁltered  versions 
of the Navier-Stokes conservation equations augmented with the 
interfacial  terms  derived  here,  where  the  ﬁlter  width  would  be 
much larger than the interface thickness but much smaller than 
the  hydrodynamic  scales.  This  would  necessarily  lead  to  closure 
problems in subgrid-scale interfacial terms, including the surface- 
tension force. The results presented here suggest that the interface 
is  in  mechanical  and  transport  near-equilibrium  for  a  signiﬁcant 
portion of its length, except near the oriﬁce and near the interface 
edge,  where non-equilibrium considerations  may  become  impor- 
tant. It could therefore be of some interest to investigate the clo- 
sure of subgrid-scale interfacial terms by reading them on-the-ﬂy 
from pre-tabulated solutions of isothermal transcritical interfaces 
at a local interface temperature provided by the resolved ﬂow ﬁeld.

Appendix A. Basic aspects of thermodynamic stability and 
phase equilibrium for transcritical systems 

The  coupling  between  the  diffuse-interface  theory  and  the 
Navier-Stokes  conservation  equations  depends  fundamentally  on 
the diffusional stability of the mixture. In unstable conditions, a 
transcritical  interface  is  generated  that  separates  mixtures  near 
phase  equilibrium.  This  appendix  reviews  basic  concepts  related 
to thermodynamic stability and phase equilibrium that are ubiq- 
uitously employed throughout the main text. 

A1. Thermodynamic-stability considerations 

The Peng-Robinson equation of state (14) , and all others avail- 
able,  constrain  all  possible  thermodynamic  states  of  the  system 
on a hypersurface P = P (ρ, T , Y 1 , Y 2 . . . Y N−1 ) . However, not all ther- 
modynamic  states  on  that  hypersurface  are  observable.  Speciﬁ- 
cally, there exist regions on that hypersurface where the system 
is thermodynamically unstable. There, a homogeneous mixture of 
the components is energetically less favorable than a conﬁguration 
where different phases or different ﬂuids are separated by inter- 
faces. The criteria that determine whether the system is thermo- 
dynamically stable are independent of the equation of state. How- 
ever, the single Maxwell loop predicted by cubic equations of state 
such as (14) naturally accommodates the stability landscape. 

In  closed  multicomponent  systems  subject  to  differential  dis- 
turbances from equilibrium, thermodynamic stability occurs when 
three  different  conditions  corresponding  to  thermal,  mechanical, 
and diffusional stability are simultaneously satisﬁed. Motivated by 

Fig. 1 , the discussion here will be precluded to bicomponent sys- 
tems  ( N = 2 ),  with  brief  references  being  made  to  monocompo- 
nent  systems  ( N = 1 )  for  conceptual  comparisons.  The  explana- 
tions are supplemented by the thermodynamic phase diagrams in 
Figs. 4 and A.1 . The reader is referred to Refs. [103–105] for gener- 
alizations and full derivations of these conditions. 

Thermal stability is observed when the constant-volume molar 

heat of the mixture is positive,

Robinson  equation  of  state  (14)  in  the  conditions  of  interest  for 
the present study. Formulas for the calculation of c v are outlined 
in Appendix C.7 , and a closer analysis of the resulting variations 
of speciﬁc heat with temperature and composition is provided in

which  guarantees  that  the  molar  volume  decreases  as  the  pres- 
sure  increases  at  constant  temperature  and  composition.  An  ex- 
pression for β
T  particularized for the Peng-Robinson equation of 
state (14) is provided in Eq. (C.44) . It can be shown that a system 
that is mechanically stable is also thermally stable, but a system 
thermally stable is not necessarily mechanically stable [104] . Most 
importantly, the limit of mechanical stability is delineated by the 
mechanical spinodal surface, whose equation is given by 
(cid:3)

= 0 ,

or equivalently β
T → ∞ . In monocomponent systems, the mechan- 
ical spinodals are easily visualized as lines intersecting all minima 
and maxima of the Maxwell loop in a P − v diagram, as shown in 
Fig. 4 . Within the region of the P − v diagram enclosed by the me- 
chanical spinodals, the isothermal compressibility is negative and 
the system becomes mechanically unstable. In this unstable region, 
the system tends to separate into two phases by means of a thin 
interface. 

A mechanical critical line exists on the mechanical spinodal sur- 
face where the pressure reaches an inﬂection point along the v axis 
at constant temperature and composition. The mechanical critical 
line is therefore deﬁned as the locus of points in the thermody- 
F } where the condition (A.3) is satisﬁed simul- 
namic space { P , T , X

A  mechanical  critical  point  is  therefore  deﬁned  as  the  in- 
tersection  of  the  mechanical  critical  line  with  constant-pressure, 
constant-temperature, or constant-composition planes. 

In  monocomponent  systems,  the  mechanical  critical  line 
(A .3) and (A .4) collapses on a single critical point in the thermo- 
dynamic phase diagram, as observed in Fig. 4 . This critical point 
determines  the  critical  pressure  above  which  the  two-phase  re- 
gion ceases to exist, or equivalently, the pressure above which the 
monocomponent system is unconditionally stable. In contrast, me- 
chanical stability is not a suﬃcient condition for thermodynamic 
stability  in  multicomponent  systems,  since  diffusional  processes

2 systems analyzed in this study are 
diffusionally  unstable  but  thermally  and  mechanically  stable  at 
pressures larger than approximately 200 bar, whereas they become 
both  mechanically  and  diffusionally  unstable  at  pressures  lower 
than those (see Appendix E ). It is the breach of the diffusional sta- 
bility constraint (A.5) what induces transcritical interfaces in the 
ﬂow ﬁeld, as discussed in Sections 4.6 and 5.4 –5.6 . Brieﬂy, the dif- 
fusional spinodals represent thermodynamic states where the Fick- 
ian diffusion coeﬃcient becomes zero. In particular, the quantity 
( ∂ ln f 
F ) P , T  fundamentally participates as a non-ideal prefac- 
tor in the Fickian diffusion coeﬃcient at high pressures deﬁned in 
Eq. (43) , in such a way that changes in the sign of ( ∂ ln f 
F ) P , T 
change the direction of the diffusion ﬂux. Outside the region de- 
limited by the diffusional spinodals [i.e., ( ∂ ln f 
F ) P , T > 0], the 
mixture is stable and the components tend to diffuse into ﬂow re- 
gions in directions aligned with decreasing gradients of their con- 
centration. In contrast, within the region delimited by the diffu- 
sional spinodals [i.e., ( ∂ ln f 
F ) P , T < 0], the chemical potential 
decreases with increasing molar fraction. As a result, the mixture is 
unstable there and tends to separate by means of antidiffusion of 
matter. This phenomenon is well characterized in physical chem- 
istry [136] , and cannot be described by the standard transport the- 
ory.

The  diffusional  and  mechanical  critical  lines  of  the  mixture 
are  generally  different.  The  intersection  of  the  diffusional  criti- 
cal line with constant-pressure, constant-temperature, or constant- 
composition planes gives rise to a diffusional critical point. These 
considerations are summarized in the thermodynamic phase dia- 
grams shown in Fig. A.1 . 

The veriﬁcation of the stability criteria (A .1), (A .2) , and (A .5) [or 
(A.7) ],  does  not  prevent  the  system  from  becoming  unstable 
to  ﬁnite-amplitude  disturbances.  Whereas  unconditional  stabil- 
ity  is  achieved  along  the  phase-equilibrium  surface,  or  coexis- 
tence  envelope,  and  everywhere  outside  the  volume  enclosed 
by  it,  interstitial  regions  exist  in  the  thermodynamic  phase  di- 
agrams  in  Fig.  4  and  A.1 (c)  that  are  enclosed  between  the 
phase-equilibrium and spinodal surfaces. The system is metastable 
there, in that ﬁnite-amplitude disturbances can render it unstable 
[103,104] . 

A2. Phase equilibrium 

Consider two thermodynamic states { P (cid:2) , T (cid:2) , X (cid:2) 

F } and { P g , T g , X g 
F } 
in  the  same  bicomponent  system  addressed  above.  These  states 
are in phase equilibrium across ﬂat interfaces when the following 
three conditions corresponding to equal pressures 
(cid:2) = P g = P e , 
P 

(A.12) 

equal temperatures 
(cid:2) = T g = T e , 
T 

(A.13) 

F =  ¯μFe , 

O =  ¯μg 
¯μ(cid:2) 

O =  ¯μOe , 

and equal chemical potentials 
F =  ¯μg 
¯μ(cid:2) 
are simultaneously satisﬁed [103,104] , with the subindex e being 
employed here to indicate phase-equilibrium values. At low pres- 
sures, (cid:2) and g denote liquid and vapor phases, respectively. In the 
high-pressure systems studied here, and more particularly above 
the critical pressures of the separate components, (cid:2) and g denote 
liquid-like and gas-like supercritical ﬂuids, respectively. 

(A.14) 

Based on Eq. (A.6) , the condition (A.14) is equivalent to the con- 

dition of equal fugacities, 
F = f g 
(cid:2) 
f 

(cid:2) 
F = f Fe ,  f 

O = f g 

O = f Oe . 

(A.15) 

In monocomponent systems, the two conditions in (A.14) are 

replaced by the single constraint 
¯μ(cid:2) =  ¯μg =  ¯μe , 
where  ¯μ is the molar Gibbs free energy. 

(A.16) 

At  the  equilibrium  values  of  pressure  P e  and  temperature  T e , 
the combination of Eqs. (A .12) , (A .13) and (A .15) , along with the 
equation of state (14) and the fugacity (B.21) , provides the equi- 
e and v g 
librium molar volumes v (cid:2) 
e , as well as the equilibrium mo- 
Fe  and  X g 
lar  fractions  X (cid:2) 
Fe .  The  subspace  of  states  satisfying  the 
above  phase-equilibrium  constraints  forms  a  surface  or  coexis- 
F }. A constant- 
tence envelope in the thermodynamic space { P , T , X 
temperature  cross-section  of  the  coexistence  envelope,  indicated 

by the VLE lines, is provided in the phase diagrams presented in 
Fig. A.1 . 

As  discussed  in  Appendix  A.1 ,  the  system  is  thermodynami- 
cally stable along the coexistence envelope and everywhere out- 
side  the  volume  enclosed  by  the  coexistence  envelope.  The  sys- 
tem is metastable in the concentric volume enclosed between the 
coexistence envelope and the diffusional spinodal surface, as indi- 
cated in Fig. A.1 (c). Thermodynamic instability occurs within the 
volume enclosed by the diffusional spinodal surface, where no ho- 
mogeneously mixed state consisting of phases (cid:2) and g can exist. 
Under these unstable conditions, the system tends to become sep- 
arated into the two equilibrium states (cid:2) and g by means of a thin 
interface. 

As explained in Section 4.4 , the diffuse-interface theory maps 
the volume enclosed by the phase-equilibrium surface in thermo- 
dynamic space into a thin interface in physical space. In its sim- 
plest representation corresponding to isothermal systems, the the- 
ory predicts that phase-equilibrium conditions are exactly satisﬁed 
on  both  sides  of  the  interface.  In  most  practical  cases,  however, 
the propellant streams are injected in the combustor at different 
temperatures, as depicted in Fig. 1 . In the presence of tempera- 
ture  gradients  across  the  interface,  the  phase-equilibrium  condi- 
tions (A .12) –(A .14) are only satisﬁed in an asymptotic sense up to 
an appropriate order of approximation provided in Sections 5.3 and 
5.6 . 

Appendix B. Transcritical behavior of thermophysical 
properties and molecular transport coeﬃcients 

A complete description of the ﬂuid motion requires speciﬁca- 
tion  of  the  thermophysical  properties  and  transport  coeﬃcients 
of the mixture. At high pressures, increasing departures from the 
ideal-gas theory are observed, and consequently derivation of more 
complex expressions are necessary. 

B1. Molar enthalpy 

The speciﬁc gradient-dependent internal energy e GD can be ob- 
tained from the total energy using Eq. (47) . The molar enthalpy h 
can be easily related to e GD by rewriting Eq. (52) on a molar basis 
as 
h = e GD W + P GD v , 

(B.1) 

where P GD is given by Eq. (50) . An expression for h as a function of 
the state variables at high pressures is provided in this section. 

The utilization of molar rather than speciﬁc values is expedi- 
ent since the resulting departure of the enthalpy from its ideal- 
gas counterpart involves integration of the equation of state (14) , 
which is written in terms of the molar volume v and of the coef- 
ﬁcients a and b on a molar basis. Speciﬁc and molar values of the 
enthalpy are simply related through the mean molecular weight as 
h = h / W . Similarly, partial speciﬁc and partial molar values of the 
enthalpy are related through the molecular weight of the particu- 
lar component, h 
i . Analogous relations apply to the entropy 
and all other thermodynamic potentials, including their partial val- 
ues.

where the last term represents a chemical work done at constant

is the volume expansivity. An expression for βv particularized for 
the Peng-Robinson equation of state (14) is given in Eq. (C.22) . 

Because of its form amenable to isolation of non-ideal effects 
arising  when  T βv (cid:16) = 1 ,  the  second  term  on  the  right-hand  side 
of  Eq.  (B.6)  is  the  basis  for  the  computation  of  the  pressure- 
induced  departure  of  the  enthalpy  with  respect  to  that  of  an 
ideal  gas  [54] .  Since  that  term  cannot  be  straightforwardly  ex- 
pressed as a linear sum of contributions from the different com- 
ponents  when  the  equation  of  state  (14)  and  the  mixing  rules 
(15) are employed, in multicomponent systems the standard ap- 
proach neglects enthalpy variations due to mixing, in such a way 
that the total variation of the enthalpy is assumed to be given by 
the  linearized  weighted  sum  of  the  variations  of  the  partial  en- 
thalpies, namely d h = 
i  [150] . This proce- 
i h 
dure is equivalent to neglecting the last term on the right-hand 
side of Eq. (B.2) by freezing the chemical composition. In this way, 
Eq. (B.6) becomes 
d h (cid:7) c p d T + ( 1 − T βv ) v d P. 

(B.8) 
For ideal gases, βv = 1 /T  and therefore the second term on the 
right-hand side of Eq. (B.8) vanishes, with h being only a function 
of T and composition. In contrast, the second term on the right- 
hand side of Eq. (B.8) is not zero at high pressures when real-gas 
effects are considered, which makes h to additionally depend on 
pressure, h = h (P, T , X 1 , . . . , X N−1 ) .

In coupling Eq. (B.8) with the Navier-Stokes equations, it is im- 
portant  to  note  that  the  integration  of  Eq.  (B.8)  is  independent 
of the thermodynamic trajectory. Consider an arbitrary reference 
state { P 0 , T 0 } in which the gas is approximately ideal, with the en- 
IG , 0 
thalpy there being denoted as h 
. The change in molar enthalpy 
between { P 0 , T 0 } and the ﬁnal state { P , T } can be 
(cid:7)h = h − h 
expressed as the sum of an isobaric change from { P 0 , T 0 } to { P 0 , 
T }, and an isothermal change from { P 0 , T } to { P , T }. The value of 

IG , 0 

54 

the reference pressure P 0 is chosen to be small compared to P (i.e., 
P 0 / P (cid:8) 1), which makes the change in enthalpy along the isobar of 
this particular integration path to occur under ideal-gas conditions. 
The integration of Eq. (B.8) using this combined trajectory yields 
the expression 

h = h

d h (P, T , X 1 , . . . X N−1 )

for the molar enthalpy at the high-pressure state { P , T }. 

The right-hand side of Eq. (B.9) is composed of two different 
terms  corresponding  to  the  two  legs  of  the  particular  trajectory 

mentioned  above.  In  particular,  h 
is  the  molar  enthalpy  of  an 
ideal gas evaluated at the end of the isobaric portion of the tra- 
jectory, namely

The bracketed quantity in (B.11) is the ideal-gas partial molar en-

thalpy h 
using  the  conservation  equations  of  mass  (44)  and  species  (46) , 
it can be shown that the conservation equations for total energy 
(47) and enthalpy (51) are independent of this origin as long as 
there are no chemical reactions in the problem. In chemically re- 
acting systems, the ﬁrst term on the right hand side of Eq. (B.11) , 
which involves the sum of the formation partial enthalpies multi- 
plied by their corresponding molar fractions, is responsible for the 
changes in enthalpy due to chemical heat release without the need 
of adding any chemical sources on the right-hand sides of neither 
the total-energy Eq. (47) nor the enthalpy equation (51) . A chemi- 
cal source would however have to be added on the right-hand side 
of the species conservation equation (46) . Despite the absence of 
chemical reactions in the present study, the choice is made here

to use the formation enthalpy h

nently found within the combustion-related literature [e.g., see Ref. 
[151] and Eq. (C.33) in Appendix C ]. 

The second term on the right-hand side of Eq. (B.9) corresponds 

to the enthalpy departure function

which  quantiﬁes  the  enthalpy  variations  of  a  real  gas  along  the

tuting the equation of state (14) into the integrand [e.g., see Refs. 
[92,152] and Eq. (C.23) in Appendix C ]. 

A similar methodology can be employed for calculating partial

real-gas effects and is plotted in Fig. B.1 (b) for C 
2 mixtures 
at two pressures. Much larger values of c p are observed for dode- 
cane than for nitrogen, with c p, F / c p, O = 10 − 15 under typical injec- 
tion temperatures. However, as indicated in Eqs. (12) and (13) , the 
relevant ratio of free-stream heat capacities that inﬂuences the su- 
percriticalization length is written in speciﬁc form and is therefore 
much smaller, with c p, F /c p, O = 2 at P ∞ = 100 bar, T F = 350 K and 
T O = 900 K. 

Figure  B.1  (b)  also  provides  the  loci  where  local  maximum 
values  of  c p  are  attained  inside  and  outside  the  coexistence  re- 
gion.  The  resulting  line  is  reminiscent  of  the  pseudo-boiling,  or 
Widom line, observed in monocomponent systems (i.e., see thick 
green dot-dashed line in Fig. 4 ), although important differences are 
worth highlighting. In monocomponent systems undergoing phase 
change, the temperature remains constant and therefore c p devel- 
ops a singularity at boiling, where a ﬁnite change of enthalpy oc- 
curs under zero variations of the temperature. As the pressure is 
increased above the critical point, a ﬁnite-amplitude peak occurs 
in c p across the pseudo-boiling condition that is characteristic of a 
second-order phase transition of the monocomponent system and, 
as described in Section 2.1 , is often associated with transcriticality 
in the existing literature. In monocomponent systems, the pseudo- 
boiling line therefore emanates from the critical point and pene- 
trates in the supercritical region of the phase diagram to progres- 
sively fade away as the peak amplitude of c p vanishes with increas- 
ing pressures, as shown in Fig. 4 . In contrast, in multicomponent 
systems, the phase change necessarily requires a ﬁnite tempera- 
ture change at all pressures because of the unfolding of the vapor- 
equilibrium line into dew and boiling branches, thereby yielding 
ﬁnite-amplitude peaks in c p even inside the coexistence region, as 
shown in Figs. 10 and B.1 (b). The resulting line that joins all lo- 
cal maxima of c p  does not necessarily emanate from the critical 
point, and, depending on the pressure and mixture components, 
may not even enter the fully supercritical region of the thermody- 
namic phase diagram. 

While the peak in c p for pure dodecane is visible in Fig. B.1 (b) 
at 50 bar and 730 K, the corresponding peak in c p for nitrogen oc- 
curs at much lower temperatures of order 130 K that are of no 
interest  for  the  problem  analyzed  in  Fig.  1 .  When  both  compo- 
nents are mixed at not too high pressures such that the peak in 
c p for each individual component is still discernible, a line can be 
traced that joins all peaks of the mixture c p , traverses the coexis- 
tence region, crosses the vapor-liquid equilibrium line at the dif- 
fusional critical point, and terminates within the single-phase su- 
percritical region at the peak of c p for dodecane, as shown in the 
left  panel  of  Fig.  B.1 (b).  However,  at  higher  pressures,  as  in  the 
right  panel  in  Fig.  B.1 (b),  where  the  peak  of  c p  for  dodecane  is 
no longer discernible, the line of maximum c p ends short within 
the  coexistence  region  and  never  crosses  the  diffusional  critical 
point. Additional lines of maximum c p are observed in molecular- 
dynamics simulations that tend to occur at much lower tempera- 
tures and may be of interest for cryogenic propellants, but those 
may not be computable using the Peng-Robinson equation of state 
[154] . 

B3. Chemical potentials 

As  shown  in  Section  5 ,  the  diffuse-interface  theory  for  mul- 
ticomponent  ﬂows  makes  ubiquitous  use  of  chemical  potentials. 
Speciﬁcally, the energy excess inherent to the interface structure, 
along  with  the  different  chemical  composition  of  the  propellant 
streams, results in gradients of chemical potentials that are respon- 
sible for molecular diffusion.

B2. Constant-pressure molar heat 

Similar departures to those observed above in the enthalpy oc- 
cur in the molar heat as a result of the high pressures. To account 
for these, the constant-pressure molar heat of the mixture can be 
derived by differentiating Eq. (B.9) with respect to temperature at 
constant pressure and composition, which gives

The right-hand side of Eq. (B.14) is the sum of two terms corre- 
sponding to ideal and non-ideal components. The ideal component 
is the ideal-gas constant-pressure molar heat that can be obtained 
from weighted sums of the ideal-gas molar heats of the individ- 
ual components as c IG 
p,i , with c IG 
i c IG 
p,i being a temperature- 
dependent  function  typically  obtained  from  tabulated  data  from 
different species [e.g., see Ref. [151] and Eq. (C.25) in Appendix C ].

p  on temperature and composition for

26 tends to migrate toward cold ﬂow zones, thereby sharpen- 
C 
ing the transcritical interface. Despite the fact that k 
F,T is an order- 
unity parameter at high pressures, the contribution of the Soret ef- 
fect to the species diffusion ﬂux is only fractional compared to the 
contribution of the composition gradients because of the compar- 
atively smaller temperature gradients across the interface, as dis- 
cussed in Section 5.6 . 

A  signiﬁcant  change  in  the  temperature  dependence  of  η,  λ, 
and D F , O  is observed in C 
26 -rich mixtures near ambient tem- 
peratures.  In  particular,  it  is  found  that  μ and  λ increase  as  T 
decreases, while D F , O  attains values that are mostly independent 
of temperature. The aforementioned trends are typical of liquids, 
26 -rich mixtures behave in a liquid-like man- 
and suggest that C 
ner  at  high  pressures  and  ambient  temperatures.  Those  corre- 
spond  to  typical  conditions  in  the  fuel  injection  port.  This  shift 
in  the  trend  of  the  transport  coeﬃcients  is  accompanied  by  a 
F,T  at intermediate concentrations, and occurs at a 
maximum in k 
pressure-dependent temperature that is well correlated with the 
pseudo-boiling  one  corresponding  to  the  maximum  molar  heat 
capacity.

C2. Coeﬃcients of the Peng-Robinson equation of state 

Despite  the  gradient  corrections  used  in  the  thermodynamic 
potentials  (16) –(18) ,  the  classic  theory  of  thermodynamics  must 
still be locally satisﬁed. A number of standard thermodynamic re- 
lations are listed in this appendix for use in the analysis. In addi- 
tion, the formulation of thermodynamic systems at high pressures 
requires complex equations of state. Quantities including thermo- 
dynamic potentials, speciﬁc heats, volume expansivity and others 
are involved in the diffuse-interface formulation described above 
and depend on the particular form of the equation of state. This 
appendix provides a summary of expressions for those quantities. 
A  number  of  relations  are  particularized  for  the  Peng-Robinson 
equation of state (14) , whose coeﬃcients are also listed here, but 
general deﬁnitions are given as well that allow for utilization of 
other  equations  of  state  by  direct  substitution.  Closure  param- 
eters  for  the  gradient-energy  coeﬃcient  (23)  are  also  supplied 
here.

Appendix D. High-pressure interfaces in subcritical 
monocomponent systems 

This  appendix  focuses  on  interfaces  arising  in  monocompo- 
nent  systems.  In  this  case,  interfaces  can  only  emerge  at  pres- 
sures  and  temperatures  below  the  critical  point,  where  two 
thermodynamic  states  are  possible  at  the  same  pressure.  The 
resulting  system  is  therefore  subcritical  everywhere.  Nonethe- 
less,  only  relatively  high  pressures  not  too  far  from  the  crit- 
ical  point  can  be  considered  because  of  the  continuum  as- 
sumption,  as  emphasized  in  Section  4.5 .  Further  details  on  the 
utilization  of  diffuse-interface  concepts  in  monocomponent  sys- 
tems  can  be  found  in  a  number  of  previous  investigations 
[53,111,14 9,16 8,169]  and  in  van  der  Waals’  original  contribution 
[108] . 

D1. Formulation 

Similar arguments to the ones made in Section 4.4 for concep- 
tualizing the diffuse-interface formalism as a thermodynamic-to- 
physical space mapping of the oscillations of the chemical poten- 
tial also apply to the pressure variations within the interface. To 
illustrate this, consider the simpliﬁed form of the mechanical equi- 
librium condition (120) for N = 1 ,

(D.2) 

(D.3) 

Similarly  to  Eq.  (31)  for  the  chemical  potential  in  systems  in 
phase  equilibrium,  Eq.  (D.1)  maps  the  pressure  oscillations  from 
thermodynamic space into a thin interface in physical space. The 
oscillation  of  the  pressure  in  thermodynamic  space  is  induced 
by the equation of state (14) evaluated in conditions where two 
phases exist, as sketched in Fig. 18 (c) for the simplest case corre- 
sponding to a ﬂat interface in phase equilibrium. In that case, a 
Maxwell’s construction rule for P can be obtained by integrating 
Eq. (28) and using Eq. (C.7) subject to the phase-equilibrium con- 
dition (A.16) , which gives

with  f g

encloses zero net area along the v axis. In contrast, Eq. (108) states 
that the net area under the oscillation of the pressure in physical 
space is non-zero and is proportional to the surface tension. It can 
be shown that the mechanical equilibrium condition (D.1) is con- 
sistent with Maxwell’s construction rule (D.4) by substituting the 
former into the latter and using the identity

as prescribed by the vanishing gradients of the density away from 
the  interface.  Analogous  oscillatory  proﬁles  of  P  are  observed  in 
bicomponent systems, as shown in Section 6 . 

The origin of Eq. (31) anticipated in Section 4.4 , which relates 
the chemical potential with the density gradients through the in- 
terface, is the mechanical equilibrium condition for monocompo- 
nent ﬂows (D.1) evaluated at uniform temperature. In this partic- 
ular case, Eqs. (31) and (D.1) are equivalent, as easily shown by 
evaluating Eq. (121) for N = 1 , which gives

Eq.  (D.6)  can  be  integrated  once  subject  to  the  phase- 
equilibrium boundary condition μ = μe at  ˆ n → + ∞ , thus leading 
to Eq. (31) . 

The equations integrated in this appendix are summarized in 
Table D.1 and consist of the mechanical equilibrium condition for 
monocomponent systems (D.1) supplemented with the equation of 
state (14) and the model (23) for the gradient-energy coeﬃcient. 
The numerical results are obtained by solving the system of equa- 
tions on uniform 1D meshes with approximately 50–75 grid points 
across the interface. The boundary conditions away from the in- 
terface correspond to phase-equilibrium densities (D.2) and (D.3) . 
The problem has a solution consisting of a steady high-pressure 
subcritical interface that separates a liquid from its vapor in phase 
equilibrium. 

The isothermal cases summarized in Table D.2 for C 

26 and 
2  are considered here. In all cases, the temperature T e  and the 
N 
thermodynamic pressure away from the interface P ∞  are smaller 
than their corresponding critical values T c and P c . As a result, the 
pseudo-trajectories  along  the  interface  in  thermodynamic  space 
are  subcritical  and  traverse  the  coexistence  region,  as  shown  in 
Fig. D.1 .

D2. Results 

The proﬁles of density and pressure obtained from integrating 
the formulation in Table D.1 are provided in Fig. D.2 . Density ratios 
of order 10 are observed in cases D and H, which correspond to the 
farthest conditions from the critical point. As the critical point is 
approached, the density and pressure proﬁles become increasingly 

[see also Eq. ( 12 -3.7) in Ref. [54] ], with ω being the acentric fac- 
tor provided in Appendix Appendix C . Whereas good agreement is 
observed in the case of nitrogen over the entire range of tested 
conditions,  the  comparison  reveals  disagreements  of  order  20%- 
30% for dodecane. These discrepancies are caused by the relatively 
large accentric factor of dodecane, for which the standard correla- 
tion is not designed to operate accurately [54] . In contrast, the nu-

Appendix E. Transcritical bicomponent systems approaching 
mechanically unstable conditions 

Relevant aspects of the formulation outlined above lead to in- 
trinsic singularities at conditions approaching the limit of mechan- 
ical stability (A.2) . The analysis in this section builds on consider- 
ations made by Gaillard et al. [38,39] , and provides thresholds in 
thermodynamic conditions leading to this behavior along with a 
palliating regularization. 

E1. Singularities of the theory at the limit of mechanical stability 

2 , O 

As  discussed  in  Secs.  1,  2.2 ,  and  3.2 ,  transcritical  conditions 
in systems fueled by heavy hydrocarbons involve combustor pres- 
sures  P ∞ (cid:2) 34  bar  (for  pure  nitrogen  coﬂows),  P ∞ (cid:2) 36  bar  (for 
air  coﬂows),  and  P ∞ (cid:2) 50  bar  (for  pure  oxygen  coﬂows).  These 
combustor pressures lead to fully supercritical pressures with re- 
spect  to  both  fuel  and  coﬂow  propellants  (see  Table  1 ).  Within 
the  practical  range  of  propellant  injection  temperatures  ( 300 −
10 0 0 K), those combustor pressures are also larger than the maxi- 
mum mechanical critical pressures of mixtures of heavy hydrocar- 
bons with N 
2 , or air (15–25 bar), and smaller than the maxi- 
mum diffusional critical pressures (50 0–10 0 0 bar). However, it is 
shown  in  Sections  4.4  and  5.3.3  that  the  thermodynamic  pres- 
sure undergoes order-unity oscillations within the interface. These 
oscillations  are  the  physical-space  counterparts  of  the  Maxwell 
loops in the coexistence region of the thermodynamic phase di- 
agram,  and  are  predicted  by  the  equation  of  state  (14) ,  or  any 
other  cubic  equation  of  state  available  in  the  literature.  Conse- 
quently, when P ∞ is not suﬃciently high, the Maxwell loops may 
generate  underpressures  within  the  interface  smaller  than  the 
mechanical  critical  pressure,  including  negative  thermodynamic 
pressures. 

The  Stefan-Maxwell  forms  of  the  standard  diffusion  ﬂuxes  of 
heat  and  species,  given  by  Eqs.  (152)  and  (153) ,  are  of  limited 
practical use in conditions where the mechanical stability criterion 
(A.2) is not satisﬁed. This is because both the fuel partial molar 
volume  ¯V F  and  the  non-ideal  diffusion  prefactor  ( ∂ ln f 
F ) P , T 
participating in the Fickian, barodiffusion, and Dufour components 
of those ﬂuxes diverge at the mechanical spinodal surface deﬁned 
in Eq. (A.3) . To understand this, note that the partial molar vol- 
ume deﬁned in Eq. (B.18) can be equivalently expressed for the fuel

2.42 nm, and 1.77 nm for cases E, F, G, and H, respectively. 

merical solution agrees well with experimental data in Refs. [72–
74] . Remarkably, the agreements between experiments and numer- 
ical  results  occur  even  at  conditions  far  away  from  the  critical 
point,  where  the  continuum  hypothesis  across  the  interface  be- 
comes hardly justiﬁable.

Whereas the partial derivatives of the pressure with respect to 
the number of moles of fuel or coﬂow species in Eqs. (E.1) and 
(E.2) are generally ﬁnite and different from zero on approach to 
the mechanical spinodals, the isothermal compressibility diverges 
there as demanded by Eq. (A.3) and illustrated in Fig. E.1 (a). As 
a  consequence,  the  partial  molar  volumes  diverge,  as  shown  in 
Fig.  E.1 (b),  although  the  molar  volume  v = X F ¯V F + (1 − X F ) ¯V O  re- 
mains ﬁnite. 

It  is  also  at  the  mechanical  spinodals  where  the  fuel  molar 
chemical  potential  develops  two  turning  points  along  the  com- 
position  axis,  as  shown  in  Fig.  A.1 (b).  As  a  result,  its  derivative 
(∂ ¯μF /∂X F ) P,T  becomes inﬁnite there, and correspondingly the non- 
F / ∂ ln X 
ideal diffusion prefactor ( ∂ ln f 
F ) P , T also diverges there, as ob- 

served in Fig. E.1 (c) and prescribed by Eq. (A.6) . The singularity in 
the non-ideal diffusion prefactor can be traced back to the partial 
molar volume as a consequence of a non-integrable singularity of 
the latter in pressure,

sion ﬂuxes of heat and species (149) and (150) .

The considerations above indicate that, in conﬁgurations where 
the  temperature  gradients  are  exactly  zero,  such  as  those  ad- 
dressed  in  Section  6 ,  the  standard  species  diffusion  ﬂux  can  be 
computed across the mechanical spinodals by direct spatial differ- 
entiation of the chemical potentials as in Eq. (150) , instead of using 
the Stefan-Maxwell form (153) . Similarly, the Dufour effect in the 
standard heat diffusion ﬂux can also be safely computed across the 
mechanical spinodals using Eq. (149) instead of the corresponding 
Stefan-Maxwell form (152) . 

Additional  singularities  need  to  be  tackled  in  conﬁgurations 
such as that addressed in Section 7 , in which there is a tempera- 
ture gradient across the interface. In particular, singularities arising 
in the volume expansivity βv and in the partial speciﬁc enthalpies 
h 
O  at  the  mechanical  spinodals  play  a  role  in  transport 
F  and  h 
mechanisms associated with temperature gradients. Note that βv 
participates in the portion of the interfacial species ﬂux (148) that 
depends on the temperature gradient. It is also required for the 
calculation of the terms in the interfacial heat ﬂux (147) that de- 
pend on the temperature gradient and on the heat transport by 
F + J F , the latter being small but non-zero in 
the net species ﬂux J 
practice because of the small but non-zero thermal Cahn numbers 
resulting from moderate temperature gradients. The difference of 
partial speciﬁc enthalpies h F − h O participates in the interdiffusion 
heat ﬂux in Eq. (149) , in the last term of the interfacial heat ﬂux 
(147) , and implicitly in the calculation of the constant-temperature 
gradient of chemical potentials in Eq. (E.4) through the difference 
of partial entropies in Eq. (151) . 

Since β
T is related to βv by the identity 

β

T diverges at the mechanical spinodals by deﬁnition, and 

(cid:3)
βv = βT

(E.5) 

then βv  also diverges there, as shown in Fig. E.1 (d). In Eq. (E.5) , 
the partial derivative of P with respect to temperature generally 
remains ﬁnite and different from zero. 

The  singularities  of  the  partial  enthalpies  at  the  mechanical 
spinodals, shown in Fig. E.1 (e and f), can be understood by con- 
sidering the identities

which can be combined with Eqs.  (E.1) and (E.2) for the partial 
molar volumes, thereby suggesting that the singular behavior of h F 
and h O is closely related to that of β
T , since the remaining partial 
derivatives generally remain ﬁnite and different from zero. Despite 
the singularities arising in the partial molar enthalpies, the molar 
enthalpy of the mixture h = X F h F + (1 − X F ) h O remains ﬁnite across 
the mechanical spinodals. 

F ,  and  h 

The  need  to  regularize  βv ,  h 

O  occurs  at  conditions 
where  temperature  gradients  exist  across  the  interface  and  the 
combustor pressure P ∞  is not suﬃciently high. The threshold for 
P ∞  depends  on  the  interface  temperature  T e ,  since  both  T e  and 
the local pressure P determine the values of the fuel molar frac- 
tion  on  the  mechanical  spinodal  surface.  A  quantiﬁcation  of  the

cally, the results shown in Fig. E.2 pertain to 1D interfaces arising 
in a phase-equilibrium mixture at pressure P ∞ and uniform tem- 
perature equal to T e . In this case, whose details are provided in 
Section 6 , the singularities in βv , h F , and h O have no effect since

∇T = 0 and J 
F + J F = 0 . In this way, the local pressure and com- 
position can be monitored in the calculations to ascertain whether 
the mixture has entered the mechanically unstable region of the 
thermodynamic phase diagram, and to evaluate the two problem- 
atic quantities βv  and h F − h O  participating in the formulation of 
non-isothermal systems.

As  indicated  in  Fig.  E.2 ,  the  minimum  combustor  pressure 
P ∞  required  to  initiate  crossings  of  the  mechanical  spinodals  in 
C 
2 mixtures increases with decreasing values of the inter- 
face temperature T e . No regularizations are needed at suﬃciently 
high combustor  pressures P ∞ (cid:2) 200 bar over the entire range of 
relevant  injection  temperatures,  since  the  system  is  always  me- 
chanically stable. 

In  the  conﬁguration  sketched  in  Fig.  1 ,  T e  is  much  closer  to 
O  near the injection oriﬁce. As a consequence, T e  in 
F  than to T 
T 
Fig. E.2 can be approximated as T 
F  plus a small temperature dif- 
ferential  that  depends  on  the  details  of  the  wake  ﬂow  created 
by the oriﬁce ring. In practice, the boundary of the mechanically 
unstable  region  in  Fig.  E.2  indicated  by  the  red  thick  solid  line 
provides approximately the minimum T 
F necessary for warranting 
mechanical stability for a given P ∞ . For instance, at the pressure 
P ∞ = 100 bar considered in the results presented in Section 7 for 
26 /N

face  is  crossed  if  T 
ever, the interface temperature increases because of the heat re- 
ceived from the hot coﬂow. When T e > 480 K, the system ceases 
to cross the mechanical spinodal surface and regularizations of βv 
and h F − h O  become unnecessary. These aspects are further ana- 
lyzed in Section 7 .

mixtures  are  associated  with  near  or  full  transgression  of  the 
mechanical-stability limit, and are denoted in Fig. E.2 as the re- 
gion hatched with dashed lines. It should be emphasized that neg- 
ative pressures do not lead to any transcendental behavior in the 
conservation equations, neither do they induce any singularities in 
the thermodynamic variables discussed in Appendix E.1 . They do, 
however, inﬂuence the calculation of transport coeﬃcients in the 
following manner. 

The dynamic viscosity μ, thermal conductivity λ, binary diffu- 
sion coeﬃcient D F , O , and thermal-diffusion ratio k 
F,T are generally 
functions  of  the  thermodynamic  pressure  and  participate  in  the 
conservation equations (44) –(47) through the viscous stress tensor 
and the ﬂuxes of heat and species. In particular, λ, D F , O , and k 
F,T 
are required for the calculation of the Onsager coeﬃcients (144) –
(146) . Whereas models for these coeﬃcients are well-established 
in  the  literature  for  ideal  and  real  gases,  including  fully  super- 
critical  ﬂuids,  relatively  much  less  is  known  about  their  behav- 
ior within the mechanically unstable region of the thermodynamic 
phase diagram, since homogeneous mixtures of phases or ﬂuids of 
fundamentally different nature are untenable there. The standard 
models  for μ, λ,  D F , O ,  and  k 
F,T  in  ﬂuids  at  high  pressures,  em- 
ployed in Appendices B.4 and F , cease to have physical signiﬁcance 
at negative pressures where, for instance, D F , O becomes undeﬁned 
because of Eq. (F.41) . However, note that the mechanical and trans- 
port  equilibrium  conditions  (107)  and  (177)  [or  their  equivalent 
forms (193) and (194) in terms of chemical potentials] are inde- 
pendent  of  viscosity  and  of  the  Onsager  coeﬃcients,  and  there- 
fore are not inﬂuenced by the locally erroneous behavior of any 
of the transport coeﬃcients under conditions leading to negative 
pressures. 

The  considerations  above  suggest  that,  in  isothermal  systems 
such as the ones treated in Section 6 , the structure of the inter- 
face is completely insensitive to the speciﬁc manner in which λ, 
D F , O , and k 
F,T are modeled. In contrast, in non-isothermal systems 
such as the one in Fig. 1 , the mechanical and transport equilib- 
rium conditions are only satisﬁed asymptotically to leading order 
in the limit of small thermal Cahn numbers, (cid:8)
T (cid:8) 1. Second-order 
effects lead to departures from equilibrium and require consider- 
ation of transport induced by temperature gradients. This involves 
evaluation of λ, D F , O , and k 
F,T across the interface, and gives rise 
to small ﬂuxes of heat and species. In absence of improved models 
for transport coeﬃcients at mechanically unstable conditions, the 
approximations 

λ(P, X F , T ) ≈ λ(P ∞ , X F , T ) , 
D F , O (P, X F , T ) ≈ D F , O (P ∞ , X F , T ) , 
k F , T (P, X F , T ) ≈ k F , T (P ∞ , X F , T ) , 
are used in this study, where the transport coeﬃcients are evalu- 
ated at the combustor pressure P ∞ , the latter being representative 
of the thermodynamic pressure everywhere away from the inter- 
face in ﬂows at small Mach numbers.

Fig. E.3.  Regularized proﬁles of (a) volume expansivity and (b) difference of partial 
speciﬁc enthalpies across transcritical interfaces in C 12 H 26 /N 2 isothermal systems at 
P ∞ = 50 bar and T e = 500 K. The plot includes regularized proﬁles with m = 0 . 01 
(dot-dashed line) and m = 0 . 1 (dashed line), along with the non-regularized case 
m = 0 (solid line). 

The differences in the regularized proﬁles of βv and h F − h O in 
Fig. E.3 have a negligible impact on the overall solution of the non- 
isothermal system addressed in Section 7 . This is shown in Fig. E.4 , 
which shows that distribution of σ over the transcritical region is 
largely independent of the regularization constant m used in Eq. 
(E.8) . The reason for the lack of sensitivity of the solution to m is 
that the terms multiplying βv and h F − h O in the ﬂuxes of heat and 
species become increasingly smaller as mechanical and transport 
equilibrium are approached, a condition that is always satisﬁed for 
a long portion of the interface, as discussed in Sections 5.7 and 7.2 . 
The singularities observed above at the limit of mechanical sta- 
bility are not unique to the Peng-Robinson equation of state (14) . 
They also occur when employing other cubic equations such as the 
van der Waals [51] or Redlich-Kwong [96,97] equations of state. 

E2. Negative thermodynamic pressures 

The thermodynamic pressure P is always a positive quantity in 
ideal gases, in which the intermolecular forces are negligible. In 
contrast, P can attain negative values in liquids since the molecules 
are closer and therefore exert a non-negligible attractive force on 
each other. Negative pressures in liquids are well-documented in 
the literature and are always associated with fully tensile mechan- 
ical states such as those participating in cavitation, nucleation, or 
capillary ﬂows [104,127,128] . These processes are thermodynami- 
cally metastable or unstable, thereby suggesting that negative pres- 
sures  often  correspond  to  transient  states  in  which  the  ﬂuid  is 
transitioning  to  a  different  phase.  Negative  pressures  may  also 
arise  in  ﬂuids  at  high  pressures,  when  the  density  is  large  and 
cohesive forces become important, as represented by the second 
term on the right-hand side of Eq. (14) , or by equivalent terms in 
other equations of state [99] .

Appendix G. Numerical methods for the calculation of 
transcritical interfaces 

The solver employed to integrate the formulation presented in 
Table  8  is  based  on:  (a)  a  second-order  central  ﬁnite-difference 
method for spatial discretization on one-dimensional non-uniform 
grids (e.g., see Ref. [174] and Ch. 2 in Ref. [175] for details); and 
(b) a fully-implicit variable-step second-order backward differenti- 
ation formula (BDF2) especially suited for time integration of stiff
equations  [176] .  The  resulting  nonlinear  system  of  equations  is 
solved through an iterative globally-convergent strategy based on

the  Newton-Raphson  method  [177]  combined  with  line  searches

residual by incorporating a backtracking routine [178] . Details are 
provided  in  this  appendix  along  with  speciﬁc  considerations  for 
isothermal and non-isothermal cases. 

G1. Spatial and temporal discretizations 

Consider the conservation equations expressed as the coupled 
differential system  ˙ y = F (t, y ) subject to y (t 0 ) = y 0 , where y de- 
notes the vector of independent variables, F (t, y ) represents the 
convection and diffusion ﬂuxes, and y 0 is the initial value of y . The 
variable-step BDF2 scheme advances the solution in time as 
(cid:3)

(cid:4)

(cid:3)
y n +1 − ( 1 + (cid:7)n ) y n + 

(cid:4)
1 + 2(cid:7)n 
1 + (cid:7)n 
= (cid:7)t n F (t n +1 , y n +1 ) , 

(cid:7)2 
n 
1 + (cid:7)n 

y n −1 

where the subscript n indicates time level, and 
(cid:7)n = (cid:7)t n / (cid:7)t n −1 

is the ratio of time steps. 

The  nonlinear  implicit  system  of  algebraic  Eqs.  (G.1)  is  itera- 
tively  solved  by  means  of  the  Newton-Raphson  method  at  each 
time  level.  Speciﬁcally,  deﬁning  M  as  the  number  of  indepen- 
dent  variables  multiplied  by  the  number  of  spatial  grid  points, 
Eq.  (G.1)  can  be  recast  into  R ( Y ) = 0 ,  with  R ∈ R M  the  vector 
of residuals and Y ∈ R M  the discrete representation of y . To ob- 
tain the distribution of Y at time n + 1 , minimization approaches 
based  on  Newton’s  method  iteratively  ﬁnd  an  updated  solution 
Y { k +1 } = Y { k } + (cid:7)Y { k }  from  the  previous  state  Y { k }  by  calculat- 
ing the Newton step (cid:7)Y { k } = −J −1 
· R { k } , where the subscript { k } 
{ k } 
refers  to  a  sub-implicit  iteration  within  the  time-level  advance- 
ment, and J 
j  is the Jacobian matrix. In this way, the 
norm of the residuals, r = R · R T , is reduced in every iteration. At 
the beginning of each time step, Y { k }  is initiated with the solu- 
tion of the previous time level Y n to eﬃciently start the iterative 
process that provides Y n +1 . 

Taking the full Newton step (cid:7)Y { k } may not decrease the resid- 
ual. This is the case, for example, when the solution state is not 

i, j = ∂ R 

i /∂ Y 

(F.1) 

(F.2) 

close  enough  to  the  minimum  where  the  quadratic  convergence 
behavior of the Newton method is achieved. The utilization of J , 
which is constructed from local derivatives, only guarantees that r 
decreases at the starting point of the Newton step, but not nec- 
essarily all the way. Therefore, to ensure that the Newton itera- 
tion reduces the residual, the updating step is premultiplied by a 
factor  G { k }  as  Y { k +1 } = Y { k } + G { k } (cid:7)Y { k } ,  with  0 < G { k } ≤ 1 .  Given 
that (cid:7)Y { k }  is a local direction of descent, the full Newton step, 
i.e., G { k } = 1 , is tested ﬁrst; this will lead to quadratic convergence 
when Y is suﬃciently close to the minimum. However, if the resid- 
ual increases, i.e., r( Y { k +1 } ) > r( Y { k } ) , (cid:7)Y { k } is backtracked along 
the  Newton  direction  testing  smaller  values  of  G { k }  until  a  local 
minimum is found. The details of this methodology, which is guar- 
anteed to eﬃciently decrease the residual norm, are fully described 
in Ch. 6 of Ref. [178] . 

An important piece of the solution methodology is the eﬃcient 
and accurate calculation of J  at each sub-iteration of the Newton- 
Raphson solver. In an ideal scenario, the best option would be to 
analytically derive the expressions for all the  terms  in the  Jaco- 
bian matrix such that only analytical evaluations of functions are 
needed  to  compute  J  at  runtime.  This  strategy  would  typically 
provide  the  most  accurate  and  computationally  eﬃcient  calcula- 
tion of the Jacobian, which is important since the complexity of 
evaluating J  scales with its size as M 3 . However, such approach is 
not optimal for transcritical ﬂows due to the complex relations be- 
tween the independent variables and the residual expressions in- 
volving standard and diffuse-interface ﬂuxes, and real-gas thermo- 
dynamic functions. Instead, a practical solution is to approximate 
the terms of J  with ﬁnite differences. Similarly to most Jacobian- 
based solvers [177,178] , this work utilizes ﬁrst-order forward ﬁnite 
differences [175] to approximate the terms of the Jacobian matrix 
as it provides a good balance between accuracy and computational 
cost, whereas the inverse of the Jacobian is calculated by means of 
a lower-upper (LU) decomposition. 

G2. Numerical considerations for cases involving equilibrium 
isothermal bicomponent systems 

In isothermal cases, the solver used in this study integrates an 
unsteady formulation that simpliﬁes to that in Table 5 in steady 

70 

L. Jofre and J. Urzay 

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 82 (2021) 100877 

state. In particular, the code integrates the mechanical equilibrium 
condition (107) and relaxes a convectionless species conservation 
equation (46) to the steady state. Correspondingly, R corresponds 
to  the  residual  versions  of  these  two  equations.  The  boundary 
conditions away from interfaces correspond to phase-equilibrium 
composition as given by Eqs. (109) and (110) . The resulting formu- 
lation, which is summarized in Table G.1 , is discretely solved on 
uniform 1D meshes with approximately 50–75 grid points per in- 
terface  thickness.  The  vector  Y  is  composed  of  the  independent 
variables ρ and Y 
F , whereas P is a dependent function of ρ and 
Y 
F  through  the  equation  of  state  (14) .  Since  the  transient  terms 
become zero at equilibrium conditions, the steady state solutions 
are independent from the initial distributions. However, to accel- 
erate the convergence of the calculations, ρ and Y 
F are initialized 
following hyperbolic-tangent proﬁles with width values estimated 
by  the  scalings  introduced  in  Section  4.4 .  Once  the  system  has 
been initialized, the discrete equations are integrated in time by 
means of the BDF2 scheme (G.1) until a steady state solution is ob- 
tained. This ﬁnal state is deﬁned as the distribution of ρ and Y 
F for 
which the solution does not change in time below a user-speciﬁed 
threshold in the inﬁnity-norm sense. The threshold utilized in the 
calculations presented in this work is || ( Y n +1 − Y n ) / Y n || ∞ < 10 −8 . 

G3. Numerical considerations for cases involving non-isothermal 
bicomponent systems 

The  non-equilibrium  formulation  integrated  by  the  solver  for 
transcritical interfaces in non-isothermal bicomponent systems is 
summarized in Table 8 . It involves the time evolution of ρ, v n , P , 
Y 
F , E , and T . However, to reduce the computational complexity, the 
number of variables integrated implicitly in time is reduced to ρ, 
F , and T by noticing that P is a function of ρ, T and Y 
Y 
F through 
the equation of state (14) , and that the total energy E is a func- 
tion of ρ, v n , Y 
F , and T through Eq. (48) . In addition, v n  can be 
calculated from ρ at every time level by advancing the continu- 
ity equation from the symmetry axis, where v n = 0 . The vector R 
is the residuals of momentum, species, and total-energy conserva- 
tion  equations,  whereas  Y  is  the  discrete  vector  of  independent 
variables ρ, Y 
F , and T . Once the distributions of these independent 
variables are initialized, the full solution state at t = 0 is evaluated 
and the discrete system of equations is advanced in time following 
the BDF2 scheme. 

√ 

The numerical solutions are obtained by integrating the system 
of equations in Table 8 in the domain 0 ≤ ˆ n ≤ 10 , 0 0 0 R F , which is 
discretized by 250 grid points on a stretched mesh [179] . The cal- 
culations  start  with  time  steps  of  order (cid:7)t = 10 −10 s .  As  the  in- 
terface broadens, the solver continuously increases (cid:7)t by satisfy- 
ing  the  stability  criterion (cid:7)n < (1 + 
2 )  [180] ,  where (cid:7)n  is  the 
time-step  ratio  deﬁned  in  Eq.  (G.2) .  However,  if  more  than  ﬁve 
sub-iterations of the Newton-Raphson solver are required to con- 
verge the solution at a given time level, the time-step size is frozen 
at the subsequent implicit iteration of the system, thereby giving 
(cid:7)n = 1 . This constraint optimizes the computational performance 
of the solver by balancing the beneﬁts of larger (cid:7)t with the longer 
wall-clock times typically required to converge the solution. The 
resulting evolution of the time-step size is such that (cid:7)t is of order 
10 −7 − 10 −6 s for most of the remainder of the calculation. Down- 
stream of the region where the interface vanishes, the time-step 
size increases to values of order (cid:7)t = 10 −6 − 10 −5 s .
