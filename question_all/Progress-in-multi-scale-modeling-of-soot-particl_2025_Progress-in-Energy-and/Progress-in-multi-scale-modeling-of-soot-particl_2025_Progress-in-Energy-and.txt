The toxicity, climate impact, as well as the physical and chemical properties of ultra-fine soot particles emitted
from combustion systems are strongly dependent on their size and morphology. Research attention has been
paid in the last three decades to developing more accurate and capable methods to model soot particle
coagulation in the presence of inception, surface growth, and oxidation, to predict particle size distribution
as well as the detailed aggregate morphology of soot. While soot particle concentrations in hydrocarbon
flames are primarily governed by soot kinetics, the morphology of soot particles is controlled by both soot
kinetics and particle dynamics. Flame-generated soot particles are fractal aggregates formed by polydisperse
and nearly spherical primary particles with a certain degree of overlapping. The properties of fractal aggregates,
nanoparticle coagulation, and soot formation chemistry all play important roles in soot formation. This article
reviews all these aspects but the focus is on recent progress in macro- and meso-scale modeling of soot particle
aggregation in laminar sooting flames to avoid the complexities of turbulence. The reviewed macro-scale
methods based on the population balance equation include the commonly used sectional methods and methods
of moments. The main features of three recently developed state-of-the-art meso-scale methods, namely the
event-driven Discrete Element Method, Monte Carlo Aggregation Code, and detailed stochastic population
balance model are reviewed. To highlight the complexities of modeling the particle size distribution and
detailed particle morphology without and with surface growth, numerical simulations of three test cases were
conducted using the event-driven Discrete Element Method, the Monte Carlo Aggregation Code, and the two
macro-scale methods. A detailed analysis of the results was presented to understand how different treatments
of particle coagulation and surface growth in the two meso-scale methods affect the predicted particle size
and morphology. The remaining challenges in modeling detailed soot particle morphology are outlined.

1. Introduction

1.1. Background

Renewable energy has been increasingly adopted in recent years to
slow down the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations.
However, combustion will likely remain the dominant source of the
world’s energy demand in the foreseeable future. More than 85% of
the world’s power generation and transportation are currently based
on combustion [1]. The main objections against combustion of fossil
fuels  are  the  unavoidable  emissions  of  combustion-generated  pollu-
tants, such as carbon dioxide, soot, and NOx. Ultrafine soot particles
are formed as a particulate byproduct during hydrocarbon combustion
and biomass burning under locally fuel-rich conditions. Soot formation
and  emissions  have  many  profound  impacts  on  economic  activities
and society, such as power generation, energy utilization, health, and
climate.  Fig.   1  shows  the  main  sources  of  anthropogenic  soot  and
carbon black, the detailed morphology of a soot aggregate, and the

positive (enhancing heat release and flame visibility, and being valu-
able nanomaterials) and negative (health and atmospheric pollution)
impacts.  Incomplete oxidation of soot particles in combustion devices,
fires, and biomass burning leads to soot emissions that are detrimental
to human health [2] and a major contributor to climate change. It
has  been  suggested  that  soot,  which  is  also  called  black  carbon  in
aerosol and atmospheric sciences, is one of the largest climate forcers
[3,4].

Although the emission of soot from combustion systems into the
atmosphere is unwanted, soot formation is highly desirable in some
applications, as shown in the lower left box of Fig.  1. The presence
of soot greatly enhances radiative heat transfer from flame to load in
furnaces and boilers, as well as improving flame visibility, which is an
important safety consideration in certain situations. Produced annually
at 11 megatons from hydrocarbons, carbon black (CB) is the largest
flame-synthesized nanomaterial by quantity and value [5]. CB is formed
through mechanisms similar to soot, however, it occurs under different

thermal and chemical conditions, involving the pyrolysis and decom-
position of hydrocarbons [5,6]. Another difference between soot and
CB formation is the particle concentration, which affects the particle
coagulation  regimes  and  rates  and  ultimately  the  particle  size  and
morphology [7]. Methane pyrolysis has recently been proposed as a
promising method to produce zero-emission hydrogen [8]. However, it
is critical to produce high quality CB as a value-added product to make
this process economically viable [9]. Developing modeling capabilities
to predict the size distributions of both primary particles and aggre-
gates, and detailed morphology of soot particles during the evolution
of soot production, are indispensable for assessing the effects of soot
emissions on health, air quality, and climate [2,3,10,11]. Furthermore,
such  modeling  capabilities  are  essential  for  accurate  quantification
of soot via optical diagnostic techniques [12–14], for the fine-tuning
of operational conditions within combustion devices to achieve more
efficient  and  cleaner  combustion,  and  for  optimizing  the  operation
parameters of CB reactors to produce specific grades of CB [7]. To this

end, it is paramount to gain detailed understanding of all the processes
involved in soot formation.

Significant research effort has been devoted to soot research in the
last few decades to gain a fundamental understanding of the physical
and chemical mechanisms governing the formation, growth, particle
dynamics, and oxidation of soot in flames and reactors [21–28]. Despite
the considerable progress in soot formation mechanisms, the soot incep-
tion process describing the transition from gas-phase precursor species
to condensed phase particles remains poorly understood [27,29]. Once
incipient soot particles are formed, they subsequently undergo con-
current coalescence, agglomeration, aggregation, surface growth, oxi-
dation, and oxidation-induced fragmentation. It is useful to point out
at  this  point  that  the  terminology  used  throughout  this  review  to
describe particle dynamics and interactions, follows the recent work of
Michelsen et al. [30]. In particular, the definitions of important terms
frequently used throughout this review are given here:

• Inception: the process of transition from gaseous precursor species

to condensed phase particle.

• Incipient particles: the products of inception.
• Coalescence: merging of two or more particles into one. It gen-
erally  refers  to  spherical  particles  of  miscible  substances.  For
soot, coalescence is generally only relevant to incipient liquid-like
particles of less than about 10 nm.

• Critical coalescence diameter: referring to the critical soot particle
diameter above which soot particles are considered solid and can
no longer undergo coalescence.

• Primary particles: the constituent building blocks of agglomerates

and aggregates.

• Coagulation:  referring  to  different  processes  that  join  two  or
more  particles  together,  including  coalescence,  agglomeration,
and aggregation.

• Agglomerates: referring to a group of particles loosely held to-

gether, i.e., physically bound particles.

• Agglomeration: referring to the process leading to agglomerates.
• Aggregates:  referring  to  a  group  of  particles  firmly  bound  to-

gether, i.e., chemically bonded particles.

• Aggregation: referring to the process leading to aggregates.

It has been known that soot inception plays the bottleneck role
in  the  overall  soot  formation  process,  whereas  soot  surface  growth
and aggregation play the dominant role in the sizes of both primary
particles [31,32] and aggregates [33,34]. Conversely, the morphology
of soot particles affects soot surface growth and oxidation by altering
the available particle surface area for surface reactions. Therefore, there
exists an intimate coupling between soot particle dynamics and soot ki-
netics. The pioneering studies of CB by Medalia and Heckman [35] and
flame-generated soot by Dobbins and Megaridis [36,37], established
that CB and soot particles are complex fractal-like aggregates formed
by nearly spherical and polydisperse primary particles. Such complex
morphology of soot and CB particles has profound implications to their
physical, chemical, and optical properties and cannot be represented
by a simple equivalent sphere. Indeed, a soot or CB fractal aggregate
has a fairly open structure with a much higher surface area than its
volume-equivalent sphere representation. A schematic illustrating the
different interactions with gas molecules and photons between a fractal
aggregate and its volume-equivalent sphere is shown in Fig.  2. The
lower panel of Fig.  2 lists several areas that are directly affected by
the particle morphology.

Traditionally, the soot volume fractions in flames and soot mass con-
centrations in the exhaust of combustion systems are the quantities of
interest. To further reduce particulate matter (PM) emissions from the
transportation section, the particle number (PN) emissions (for particles
larger than 23 nm) have been regulated in Europe and China since 2013
and 2020, respectively, initially for emissions from passenger cars and
later for light-duty vehicles. Regulations on PN emissions have led to

curves indicate the particle mean free path (trajectories of the particle center of mass) related to its mobility/diffusion and the longer dashed blue lines than the shorter solid
blue lines imply that the fractal aggregate has a higher mobility than its spherical counterpart. Correctly predicting the detailed soot particle morphology has significant impact
on different applications listed in the lower panel, color-coded according to the figure. Tire-LII stands for time-resolved laser-induced incandescence, SP2 for single particle soot
photometer, ELS for elastic light scattering, and SMPS for scanning mobility particle sizer.

increased attention on ultrafine particles (diameters below 100 nm),
as these particles typically dominate PN emissions despite contributing
only marginally to total particle mass. This shift in focus contrasts with
earlier regulations that primarily targeted particulate mass, overlooking

the  possible  high  number  concentration  and  small  sizes  of  emitted
particulate matter, and their potential impact on human health. The
regulations on PN emissions indicate that more attention is paid to
ultrafine particles below 100 nm, since they dominate PN emissions but

contribute only slightly to particle mass. Increasing research attention
has  been  paid  to  developing  modeling  capabilities  in  the  last  two
decades to predict the soot particle size and morphology due to their
important impact on the properties of soot, such as toxicity, mobility
diameter, collision diameter, surface area, and absorption and scatter-
ing cross sections. The increasingly more stringent emission standards
further motivate the development of more accurate and more capable
models to predict not only soot volume fraction, but also the size,
morphology, and number density in flames and combustion devices.

As mentioned above, soot size and its morphology are governed
by kinetics and particle dynamics. While the former deals with chem-
istry of soot formation, namely soot inception and surface reactions
with gaseous species for surface growth and oxidation, the latter con-
cerns all the particle interactions affecting the size and morphology
of soot particles. The evolution of polydisperse size distributions of
both primary particles and aggregate of soot particles is described by
the  integro-differential  Smoluchowski  equation,  which  is  commonly
known as the population balance equation (PBE) [38–40]. The history
and derivations of PBE have been reviewed by Rigopoulos [39] and
Solsvik  and  Jakobsen  [40].  PBE  has  been  generalized  to  take  into
account various physical and chemical processes that affect particle
size distribution (PSD), such as inception, surface growth, oxidation,
coalescence, agglomeration, and fragmentation. In addition, the PBE
has been widely used to model particle dynamics in many fields of
science and engineering, including but not limited to crystallization,
carbon black synthesis, flame synthesis of nanoparticles, soot, atmo-
spheric aerosol, and separation. It is important to point out that PBE is a
macroscopic equation used to describe the evolution of size distribution
of  a  system  containing  a  large  number  of  polydispersed  particles.
Therefore, population balance modeling typically does not deal with
the evolution of individual particles and consequently cannot be used
to predict the morphology of individual particles. On the contrary,
population balance modeling relies on assumptions of certain aspects
of particle morphology to predict soot aggregate size distribution. For
example, it is necessary to assume the soot aggregate fractal dimension
to calculate the collision rate between soot particles [41–43].

In the context of modeling soot formation in flames, PBE has often
been coupled with soot kinetic models through the method of moments
(MOM) [39,44–46] or sectional methods (SM) [42,43,47–49]. In MOM,
the PBE is reformulated into a small number (typically about 5 to 10)
of transport equations of the moments of the PSD required to determine
the physical quantities of interest, such as soot particle number density
and volume fraction, or to evaluate the rates of various physical and
chemical processes involved in soot formation and particle dynamics,
such  as  soot  particle  collision,  inception,  and  surface  growth.  The
main  advantage  of  MOM  is  its  high  computational  efficiency  since
only  few  transport  equations  of  moments  are  to  be  solved  to  deal
with  soot  particle  dynamics.  However,  MOM  requires  a  closure  to
relate the higher-order to lower-order moments, and are in general
unable to provide the PSD, except in situations where the PSD can
be assumed to follow a specific mathematical expression. Nonetheless,
recent approaches have partially overcome this limitation by integrat-
ing moment methods with reconstructive techniques that approximate
the full PSD. For example, Salenbauch et al. [50] used superimposed
kernel density functions, Ferraro et al. [51] applied a similar strategy
in turbulent conditions, and Wu et al. [52] employed joint moment
projection and maximum entropy reconstruction to capture bimodal
distributions in diesel engines. In essence, the goal of the MOM is to
predict the moments of PSD in flames without explicitly tracking the
PSD, since the moments are often the physical quantities of interest.
In  this  context,  Frenklach  [53]  formulated  governing  equations  for
moments  of  the  discrete  soot  size  distribution,  with  Frenklach  and
Harris [54] later applying these to pure coagulation and combined
nucleation, coagulation, and growth cases. Their MOM with polynomial
interpolation  closure  (MOMIC)  led  to  modeling  soot  under  various
conditions, including premixed flames at low and high pressures and

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 110 (2025) 101234

the transition from coalescent to aggregation growth [55–59]. Alter-
native closures, such as QMOM [60] and DQMOM [61,62], were later
introduced. Mueller et al. [63] combined MOMIC and DQMOM in an
Hybrid  MOM  (HMOM),  adding  a  delta  function  for  small  incipient
particles. For a more detailed overview, the reader is referred to the
review of Rigopoulos [64] and Section 4 of this work.

In sectional methods, the entire range of particle mass or volume
relevant  to  the  particle  system  of  interest  is  divided  into  a  num-
ber of discrete bins or sections. Then, transport equations of particle
number  density  in  each  section  are  solved  to  provide  the  discrete
PSD.  Two  main  approaches  have  been  employed  for  implementing
sectional  methods  in  soot  modeling.  In  the  first,  the  soot  particle
population is treated separately from the gas-phase chemistry, with
incipient  particles  introduced  via  PAH  collisions,  and  the  coupling
to the gas phase occurring primarily through these nucleation steps.
For example, Colket and Hall [65] applied such a strategy to laminar
premixed flames, incorporating inception, surface growth, and particle
coalescence. Smooke et al. [66] further refined this approach to model
laminar coflow diffusion flames. Park and Rogak [67] then mitigated
the substantial numerical diffusion inherent in fixed-sectional meth-
ods [68], and integrated these models into general kinetic packages
such as Chemkin [47]. In the second approach, soot is represented as
a series of pseudo-gas species integrated directly within the chemical
kinetic mechanism. Richter et al. [69] extended the concept of PAH-
based soot growth to include ‘‘bins’’ of species spanning from large
PAHs  (up  to  3200  amu)  to  soot-like  molecules  (treated  as  pseudo-
gas species, starting from 3201 amu). D’Anna and Kent subsequently
employed this representation to develop skeletal soot production mech-
anisms that accounted for inception, surface growth, coagulation, and
oxidation [70], and they demonstrated successful applications to both
non-premixed [71] and premixed [72] flames. Sirignano et al. [73]
built upon this integrated framework to include dehydrogenation path-
ways to capture soot graphitization, and O2-induced fragmentation.
These fully coupled sectional approaches have also been applied to
unsteady counterflow flames [74], turbulent flames [75], and imple-
mented within the OpenSMOKE++ simulation environment [76]. The
sectional methods (SMs) are in general significantly more computa-
tionally demanding than MOM. In addition, the fixed sectional method
suffers substantial numerical diffusion [68]. To take into account the
fractal-like structure of soot aggregates, quasi-bivariate MOM and SM,
which consider polydisperse aggregate size but monodisperse primary
particle size, have often been employed to model soot particle dynamics
in sooting flames. Although these macroscopic quasi-bivariate methods
are able to predict the aggregate size distribution and the mean primary
particle size, they cannot derive the primary particle size distribution,
the degree of primary particle overlapping, or the aggregate fractal di-
mension. Therefore, they are unable to predict the detailed morphology
of soot particles.

Based on transmission electron microscope (TEM) images, it has
been  established  that  both  soot  and  CB  particles  form  fractal-like
aggregates. These aggregates consist of polydisperse and nearly spher-
ical  primary  particles  that  exhibit  a  certain  degree  of  overlap  and
necking  [37,77].  These  morphological  features  have  been  found  to
be the result of complex interactions between soot kinetics and soot
dynamics. Simulation using detailed particle models has shown that
the  high  sphericity  of  primary  particles  is  due  to  the  simultaneous
aggregation with incipient soot and surface growth [31,32], whereas
the overlap/neck between neighboring primary particles in soot aggre-
gates is attributed to particle coagulation in the presence of surface
growth [31,33,34,78]. The morphological details of soot particles have
significant  impact  on  their  optical  and  physical  properties,  as  well
as the specific surface area of soot particles. Detailed morphology of
soot particles is required to accurately predict their radiative proper-
ties [79–81] and other physical properties, such as heat conduction
rate and drag [82–84]. The complex morphology of soot particles poses

6

F. Liu et al.

challenges in accurately modeling particle dynamics and resolving mor-
phological details. This complexity is characterized by polydispersity in
the size of both primary particles and their aggregates, overlap among
neighboring primary particles, and variations in the number of spheres
in contact (coordination number) or the presence of necking at the
contact regions between primary particles. To accurately predict the
detailed morphology of individual soot particles, a comprehensive un-
derstanding is necessary. This includes the mechanisms controlling soot
particle agglomeration/aggregation in the presence of inception, sur-
face growth, oxidation, and oxidation-induced particle fragmentation.
These processes vary across different flow and aggregation regimes,
which are characterized by factors such as Knudsen numbers, residence
time, and soot particle concentration. Additionally, it is necessary to
employ a detailed particle model that explicitly tracks the evolution
of individual particles. Physics-based particle models track the motion,
coagulation, and mass transfer with gas-phase species (surface growth
and oxidation) of individual particles, including both primary particles
and agglomerates/aggregates, by commonly solving the Langevin equa-
tions. These particle models are known as discrete element methods
(DEMs) and include the extensively studied diffusion-limited, ballistic-
limited, and reaction-limited cluster-cluster aggregation (DLCA, BLCA,
RLCA) [85–87]. Meso-scale methods typically resolve physical domains
on the order of few hundreds of nanometers and track particles ranging
from the constituent primary particles of several nanometers to fairly
large  aggregates  consisting  of  a  few  hundreds  of  primary  particles.
Meso-scale particle methods, however, do not describe the soot in-
ception  process,  i.e.,  the  transition  from  gaseous  precursor  species
to condensed phase particles, and rely on a soot inception model to
provide the incipient soot particles, or assume a known size distribu-
tion of primary particles to initiate the particle dynamics. Although
soot inception has often been modeled as a result of collision among
assumed PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) precursor species,
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are able to describe the details
of soot inception, e.g. [88], a topic that is beyond the scope of this
review. This review concerns mainly the meso- and macro-scale particle
dynamics methods.

Two types of method have been developed to numerically generate
soot aggregates to study their optical and physical properties: tunable
algorithms and physics-based particle models. Tunable algorithms in-
clude the early cluster-particle aggregation and cluster-cluster aggrega-
tion algorithms of monodisperse spherical primary particles including
FLAGE [82,89], and more recently developed FracVAL [90] algorithm
for  polydisperse  primary  particles.  These  methods  were  developed
to  generate  fractal  aggregates  of  specified  parameters,  i.e.,  primary
particle diameter, number of primary particles, fractal dimension, and
fractal  prefactor,  regardless  of  the  mechanisms  leading  to  such  ag-
glomerates.  These  methods  only  generate  fractal  aggregates  formed
by either monodisperse or polydisperse spherical primary particles in
point-contact. Realistic aspects of soot particles observed in TEM im-
ages, namely primary particle overlapping and necking, can be added
to the numerically generated fractal aggregates in a post-processing
manner [79,83,91,92]. Physics-based particle models include the EDEM
(Event Driven Discrete Element Method) [33,93,94], the DEM-based
Monte Carlo model termed MCAC (Monte Carlo aggregation code) [95,
96],  and  the  detailed  population  balance  model  (DPBM)  [97–99].
These physics-based methods are capable of generating realistic soot
aggregates formed by polydisperse primary particles with certain de-
gree of overlapping without making assumptions with regard to the
morphology of soot aggregates.

1.2. Aims and scope

Considerable effort has been devoted to develop increasingly more
capable and accurate methods to predict particle size distribution and
detailed particle morphology at both macro- and meso-scales over the
last three decades. Several recent reviews have appeared to summarize

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 110 (2025) 101234

the progress in different aspects of particle dynamics modeling. Singh
et al. [100] discussed the numerical methods for solving the PBE with a
focus on the finite volume method, Monte Carlo (MC) method, and the
sectional method. Rigopoulos [39] discussed the strengths and weak-
nesses of two methodologies for dealing with polydisperse particles
in  reacting  flows.  One  method  involves  the  Lagrangian  tracking  of
individual particles, while the other employs a statistical description of
a particle system in the form of a PBE, which describes the evolution
of the particle size distribution function. Although the focus was on
the development and application of PBE-based methods, these are used
for modeling reacting flows involving particles, such as soot, flame
synthesis of nanoparticles, droplet combustion, and coal flames. An in-
depth discussion was devoted to the development and solution methods
of PBE as well as various closure issues in modeling particle dynam-
ics in turbulent flows. More recently, Rigopoulos [64] reviewed the
progress and challenges in modeling soot aerosol dynamics in turbulent
flows. The review discussed available soot kinetic models, different
methods  to  deal  with  soot  aerosol  dynamics,  such  as  Monte  Carlo
methods,  method  of  moments,  and  discretization  methods,  and  the
closure problem of soot modeling in turbulent flows. In particular, the
focus of Rigopoulos [64] was placed on closure of various terms arisen
from turbulence-soot interactions in Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes
(RANS) modeling or sub-grid modeling in large-eddy simulation (LES).
Turbulence affects soot through both soot kinetics (inception, surface
growth,  and  oxidation)  and  aerosol  dynamics.  Endres  et  al.  [101]
provided  a  comprehensive  review  of  models  describing  the  contact
forces between nanoparticles within the context of discrete element
modeling of aggregation, agglomeration, and film formation. However,
the review of Endres et al. did not focus on specific aerosol applications.
Li et al. [102] discussed soot models of different length scales. The
authors considered the one- and two-equation soot models as macro-
scale, PBE-based soot models as meso-scale, and DEM and molecular
dynamics (MD) based soot models as microscale. Additionally, dedi-
cated reviews involving reactive MD for combustion systems can be
found elsewhere [103]. It is worth pointing out that the multi-scale
modeling of soot aggregation to be discussed in the present review
differs significantly from the review of Li et al. [102] in terms of both
contents and classification of methods. The focus of our review is on
soot particle dynamics modeling and we regard PBE based methods,
namely MOM and sectional methods, DEM, and MD as macro-scale,
meso-scale,  and  microscope  methods,  respectively,  as  illustrated  in
Fig.   3.  This  classification  of  particle  methods  of  different  scales  is
consistent with Buesser and Pratsinis [104], who reviewed multiscale
tools for the design of aerosol reactors and processes for the synthe-
sis  of  nanomaterials.  Methods  of  multiscale  consist  of  macro-scale,
meso-scale, molecular dynamics, and quantum mechanics models that
span 10 and 15 orders of magnitude in length and time, respectively.
Buesser and Pratsinis [104] discussed the inter-dependence of these
multiscale methods and emphasized the dominant role of coagulation
in nanoparticle growth due to high particle number concentration in
such aerosol processes. Eggersdorfer and Pratsinis [105] provided an
excellent overview of applications, characterization, and formation of
agglomerates and aggregates formed by spherical primary particles.
The focus of the review of Eggersdorfer and Pratsinis [105] was on
collision between fractal-like agglomerates and the important role of
sintering on aggregate formation for non-soot nanoparticles, though the
effect of surface growth on soot aggregation was also briefly discussed.
More recently, Boje and Kraft reviewed stochastic population balance
methods  developed  in  the  last  two  decades  for  detailed  modeling
of aerosol particles produced in flames [99]. This type of methods,
also termed detailed population balance modeling approach or high-
dimension particle models, is able to predict the complex shape of
particles, such as fractal aggregates formed by polydisperse primary
particles with overlapping, by introducing detailed particle type space
models to track the compositions, size, and the relative positions of
primary particles. The focus of the review of Boje and Kraft [99] was

conservation equations. The PBE (population balance equation) has often been solved using MOM or the sectional method. The solution domain of macro-scale modeling is on
the order of the actual flame size. Meso-scale methods, namely MCAC (Monte Carlo aggregation code), EDEM (event-driven discrete element method), DSPB (detailed stochastic
population balance) models, and Langevin dynamics (middle part), are used to investigate the coagulational behavior and detailed morphology of individual soot particles. The
solution domain of meso-scale simulations is on the order of few to few tens of nm. MD simulations are used to study certain particle properties at the molecular level. MD can

the development, implementation, and application of detailed stochas-
tic particle modeling. These recent reviews focused on different aspects
of particle dynamics. However, none of the above-mentioned reviews
provided a broad overview of soot particle dynamics and an in-depth
view of recent progress in discrete element methods applied to soot
particle agglomeration in the presence of surface growth.

In this article, we intend to provide a detailed review of recent
progress in modeling soot aggregation in laminar sooting flames. The
review covers both macroscopic and meso-scale approaches of particle
dynamics, and the focus is placed on the recent development of discrete
element modeling of fractal agglomerates and its applications to model
detailed morphology of individual soot particles in the presence of
surface growth under conditions relevant to laminar sooting flames.

2. Morphology and properties of fractal aggregates

As explained in the introduction, the main challenge in multi-scale
modeling of soot is to take into account its complex morphology, which
affects its physical, chemical and optical properties. As illustrated in
Fig.  2, the mobility of a fractal cluster is indeed very different from
that of its volume-equivalent spherical counterpart, which has, as an
example, an impact on aggregation and therefore on size. Similarly,
the specific surface area of the fractal object is significantly higher than
the spherical particle, strongly affecting surface-based processes, such
as surface growth.

In this regard, meso-scale methods have provided detailed descrip-
tions of the soot fractal-like morphology, facilitating the monitoring of
soot emissions, as well as the characterization of the soot climate and
health effects. For example, the soot agglomerate morphology derived
by DEM can assist the robust monitoring of soot emissions. Also, a DEM-
derived power law for the effective density of soot, ρeff, was recently
interfaced with scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) measurements
to assist the accurate monitoring of the soot volume fraction, fv, in

flame reactors and combustion engines. The soot fv is a key prop-
erty for combustion models as it is essential to close the soot mass
balance [107,108]. Such models are often benchmarked with soot fv
data obtained by SMPS assuming spheres. Neglecting the aggregate and
agglomerate structure of soot results in an overestimation of the true
soot fv obtained directly by aerosol particle mass analyzer (APM) by up
to a factor of 4 [109]. So, the DEM-derived power law for soot ρeff en-
abled the accurate monitoring of soot fv by SMPS, assisting combustion
models to close their mass balance [109]. Oversimplifications regarding
the morphology of soot are made often by toxicologists to determine
its lung deposition. In particular, computational algorithms, such as
the multi-path particle dosimetry model [110], are used to estimate
the mass of soot nanoparticles deposited at different regions of the
respiratory system using the bulk density ρb instead of ρeff. The inhaled
doses estimated that way are used in in-vitro cell studies to determine
various health effects of soot nanoparticles. However, neglecting the
realistic  soot  agglomerate  structure  and  ρeff  overestimates  its  lung
deposited mass by a factor of about two [111]. Therefore, accounting
for the ramified structure of soot is essential to determine accurately
its  impact  on  public  health.  The  morphology  of  soot  nanoparticles
affects also their optical properties that are essential to estimate their
direct  climate  impact.  The  light  scattering  and  absorption  by  soot
agglomerates are quantified by their mass scattering (MSC) and ab-
sorption (MAC) cross-sections. These are the equivalent cross-sections
of spheres exhibiting the same light scattering and absorption with the
soot agglomerates normalized by their mass. The soot light scattering
and absorption can be estimated by interfacing agglomerates simulated
by EDEM or MCAC with discrete dipole approximation (DDA) [112].
The soot optical properties derived by DEM-DDA accounting for its
realistic structure are in excellent agreement with light scattering and
absorption measurements of soot from premixed, diffusion flames and
combustion engines [113]. Most importantly, the global distribution
of the direct radiative forcing (RF) induced by soot agglomerates was

8

F. Liu et al.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 110 (2025) 101234

obtained  by  interfacing  a  climate  model  with  the  MAC  derived  by
DEM-DDA. That way, it was shown that accounting for the realistic
soot morphology increases its direct RF globally by 25–50%, explaining
nicely the satellite observations [114]. For these reasons, this section
aims to describe the morphology of soot aggregates and define the
main size and morphological parameters involved in different physical
processes.

The advent of electron microscope in the 1930s was seminal for
the study of aerosols. In the 1950s, some studies proposed to quantify
the shape of observed particles by introducing shape factors and the
projected surface area or perimeter length [115,116]. Up to now, trans-
mission electron microscope (TEM) image analysis remains the most
direct way to determine the primary particle diameter of soot (Dp), and
significant progress has been achieved to improve the exploitation of
TEM images for more efficient and accurate recognition and reconstruc-
tion of primary particle size distribution and aggregate morphology
[36,117–119]. It is also the most direct way to determine the degree
of  overlapping  between  adjacent  primary  spheres  as  quantified  by
the overlapping coefficient [92]. Nevertheless, the access to other 3D
quantities has to take into account the fact that the aggregate projection
on TEM images is two-dimensional. Therefore, some 3D-2D conversion
correlations have been developed [37,120,121]. For example, Köylü
et  al.  have  determined  a  relationship  between  2D  and  3D  radii  of
gyration for DLCA aggregates [122]. The radius of gyration is defined
as the radius of a sphere with the same inertia as the particle under
consideration. It is particularly important for the interaction between
light and particles in the Rayleigh regime [123]. It can be calculated as
the square root of the average of summation over all primary spheres
of the squared distance between their center and the aggregate center
of mass. For numerically generated aggregates, this can be done in 3D
with the knowledge of the positions of primary spheres in 3D space. For
real (2D) TEM images, this can be done by identifying the positions of
the primary spheres in the projected image. Köylü observed that the 3D
radius of gyration was 1.24 times that of the 2D one, regardless of the
aggregate size characterized by the number of primary particles.

Although 3D reconstruction of electron tomography has been em-
ployed  to  investigate  detailed  morphology  of  flame-generated  soot
particles [124–127], this process is significantly more time-consuming
than the conventional TEM image analysis and therefore has rarely
been used.

2.1. Fractal scaling law and population based fractal parameters

On the basis of established correlations relating the aggregate pro-
jected area to the number of primary spheres in the aggregate Np and
those relating the 2D gyration radius or the maximum projected length
to the 3D gyration radius Rg [128], a widely accepted power-law called
the fractal scaling law has been empirically established [37]:

Np = kf p

( 2Rg
Dp

)Df p

,

(1)

where Dp is the primary sphere diameter. This scaling law is extremely
useful since it relates the particle mass to its size and parametrizes key
morphological parameters (see Fig.  4). The origin of this power-law
stems from the quasi self-similar process of agglomeration. Correspond-
ingly,  two  parameters  kf p  and  Df p,  called  respectively  the  fractal
prefactor and fractal dimension, began to appear in the literature. The
values of those parameters for soot are between 1 and 3 for kf p and
between 1.6 and 2 for Df p. By nature, Df p is related to the particle
structural compactness since Df p = 1 refers to a line shape whereas
Df p = 3 corresponds to spheres. On the other hand, kf p , among
others,  is  related  to  a  local  compactness.  The  overlapping  between
primary spheres, the presence of necking at the contact region, and
the coordination number (the average number of connection between
neighboring primary particles) can affect these parameters. Neverthe-
less, because the fractal law is based on Rg, kf p also depends on the

Fig. 4.  The properties of a soot aggregate in the fractal-law.

particle size [129], anisotropy [130], and even the fractal dimension
itself [131]. The determination of kf p and Df p for a population of
particles consists in simply fitting Np as a function of 2Rg∕Dp on log–
log scale by an affine function. As such, Df p equals to the slope of
the plot and kf p is related to the intercept. It is noticed that each
data point on this plot represents a particular aggregate, thus, a large
number of aggregates are required to obtain statistically meaningful
Df p and kf p. Therefore, the resultant Df p is statistical and represents
the population-based fractal dimension (as implied by the subscript
p in Df p). Experimentally determined fractal parameters using TEM
image analysis and light scattering methods are population-based. The
analysis of TEM images commonly relies on the correlation given in
Eq. (2), originally proposed by Medalia [116], between the number of
primary particles in the aggregate and the ratio of the projected area
(Aa) of the aggregate and the cross section area of primary particle (Ap):

Np = kα

)α

,

( Aa
Ap

(2)

where α and kα are empirical constants. These population-based ap-
proaches  do  not  allow  to  describe  adequately  the  morphology  of
individual particles, which may become necessary to better evaluate
the  morphology,  specific  surface  area,  radiative  properties,  or  any
other properties of individual particles. Autocorrelation of binarized
images  or  the  application  of  box-counting  methods  [132]  can  pro-
vide morphological information of individual particles. Nevertheless,
with the exception of rare studies that have analyzed the 3D mor-
phological  properties  of  soot  reconstructed  by  electron  microscopy
tomography  [133],  the  analysis  has  generally  been  performed  on
projected 2D images with some loss of information, particularly if the
individual fractal dimension is greater than 2. For these reasons, it is
necessary to develop modeling capabilities that are able to resolve the
3D morphology of individual particles from meso-scale modeling or to
improve algorithms of tomographic reconstruction based on 3D TEM
imaging. The importance of modeling the morphology of individual
soot particles is further discussed at the beginning of Section 5.

2.2. Pair-correlation and individual particle fractal dimension

One  of  the  most  powerful  methods  to  describe  the  morphology
of an individual fractal-like aggregate is through the analysis of its
pair-correlation function. The latter can be evaluated in two different
ways, namely, (1) the number-based pair correlation AN (r), and (2) the
volume-based pair correlation AV (r). AN (r) represents the probability
of finding a given number of primary particles at a given distance r
from the center of any primary particle belonging to an aggregate [82,
131,134]. Similarly, AV (r) indicates the probability of finding material
from any point belonging to the aggregate. AN (r) has been commonly
used in different disciplines, such as physics, chemistry, and material
science, to describe the geometry of molecules, crystals, and polymers.
However, AN (r) may not be well suited for certain nanoparticles, such

9

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 110 (2025) 101234

as those generated in flames, because we cannot neglect the primary
particle  volume.  We  also  focus  on  AV (r)  since  it  is  more  adapted
to the description of aggregates whose primary particles are not in
point-contact, making the definition of the number of primary particles
less obvious than for agglomerates formed by point-contact primary
particles, i.e., without overlapping. Moreover, the volume approach
can easily account for primary particle polydispersity [90]. The zeroth
moment  of  the  isotropic  pair  correlation  function  AV (r)  is  directly
related to the total volume of the aggregate Vagg as:

AV (r) = Vagg

dVagg
4πr2dr

,

∞

∫

r=0

AV (r)4πr2 dr = V 2

agg.

(3)

The ratio of the fourth and second moments gives the squared radius
of gyration of the aggregate, which is used in the fractal law shown
in Eq. (1). AV (r) is also directly related to the radiative properties
of agglomerates since the angular distribution of scattered light by a
particle is proportional to the Fourier transform of AV (r) [135]. More-
over, it also plays an important role in physical phenomena involving
interactions (or coupling) between primary particles. For example, the
van der Waals (vdW) interaction forces between agglomerates can be
modeled based on the pair-correlation function [136,137]. The pair-
correlation function has also been used to determine the hydrodynamic
interactions of primary particles in the continuum flow regime (Stokes)
based on the Kirkwood-Riseman theory [138,139].

For idealized large fractal agglomerates, when the pair-correlation
is averaged over many orientations of the agglomerate, one can find the
following scaling-law AV(r) ∝ rDf i−3, where Df i is the fractal dimension
of the individual agglomerate studied. This scaling-law is only observed
for intermediate scales between r ≫ Rp (referred to as small scale) and
r ≪ 2Rmax (referred to as the large scale) where Rmax is the half of
the maximum distance between primary particles in an agglomerate.
A more general model for the volume-based pair correlation function
was recently proposed for fractal agglomerates by considering primary
particle polydispersity as well as cutoff functions at the referred small
and large scales [129],

the pair correlation function amplitude in the fractal domain, indicates
the compactness of primary particles, i.e., how close primary particles
are and the level of overlapping between them. Based on the proposed
model, kf p can be determined after calculating the aggregate volume
and  radius  of  gyration,  which  shows  that  kf p  also  depends  on  the
size parameter, making it less relevant from a physical point of view.
Fig.  5 shows a graphical representation of this model and its different
parameters.

The model given by Eqs. ((4)a-c) is valid for all radial distances
r > 0 and can be used to model aggregates of any size down to an
isolated primary particle where Aagg = 0 and A(r) = App. Thereby,
quantities  φ,  Df i,  ξmax,  Rpv  and  β  can  be  fitted  to  the  numerical
computation of volume-based pair correlation function of numerically
generated aggregates, providing detailed and relevant morphological
information [34].

gregate, Rp,i and Vp,i are respectively the ith primary particle radius
and  volume,  Rv  is  the  volume  equivalent  primary  sphere  radius,  ξ
and ξmax are characteristic lengths of the agglomerate, β is the stretch-
ing exponent, and φ is the packing factor which quantifies the local
compactness. The greater the stretching exponent β, the greater the
decrease in the pair correlation function for a given radius. This means
that the probability of finding material falls rapidly towards zero at
that radius, as does a sphere. The more anisotropic the particle, the
less the decrease in pair correlation, corresponding to lower values
of  β.  Heinson  et  al.  [130]  have  shown  a  correlation  between  this
parameter and the aggregate anisotropy defined as the ratio between
the largest and smaller eigenvalues of the particle’s inertia matrix. They
also found a correlation with the population based fractal prefactor
kf p. For a given aggregate size Rg, primary particle Dp and fractal
dimension Df p, a larger kf p corresponds to a more massive aggregate
(larger Np). This means that locally, the number of spheres increases,
for example by increasing the average number of primary spheres in
contact, which is linked to a higher packing factor φ. We note here that
some previous studies have preferred the parameter f = 1∕φ referred
to as the filling factor [139]. The packing factor, which directly acts on

As  explained  in  the  previous  sections,  the  fractal  dimension  of
agglomerates (based either on population or determined for individual
particles)  is  one  of  the  most  important  parameters  to  characterize
structural compactness. Complementarily, the local compactness can
be evaluated by the packing factor φ or less directly by the fractal
prefactor kf . These descriptors are purely geometrical. Most of the
time, they are derived from TEM image analysis or by light scattering
experiments. Nevertheless, attempts have been made to express similar
information based on mobility-based experiments. Indeed, a reference
non-optical method to characterize aerosols is to make use of their
electrical mobility diameter Dm. When exposed to an electric force, the
charged particles quickly reach a terminal velocity in the surrounding
gas. That terminal velocity is obtained when an equilibrium between
the electric force fe = neE and the aerodynamic force fagg = 3πηDm
Vrel
Cc (Dm)
is  reached  and,  therefore,  for  a  given  electric  field,  that  terminal
velocity depends on the particle size. In these expressions, n is the
number of elementary charges, e the charge of a single particle, E the
external electric field, η the dynamic viscosity, Cc the Cunningham slip
correction factor, and Vrel the relative velocity. Thus, only particles
having a specific size can reach the outlet of the column of a Differential
Mobility Analyzer (DMA) after having been exposed to a given electric
field. This specific size is defined by the particle’s electrical mobility,
Ze,  which  is  defined  as  the  ratio  of  the  terminal  velocity  and  the
corresponding electric field,

Ze =

neCc (Dm)
3πηDm

.

In  this  expression,  the  particle  is  supposed  to  carry  n  elementary
charges e, to move in a fluid of dynamic viscosity η. It is characterized

by its mobility diameter Dm, and Cc is the Cunningham slip factor that
has been established in order to consider the change of flow regime
for spheres. Therefore, if the particle is spherical, Dm corresponds to
the geometric diameter. If the particle is not spherical, the mobility
diameter becomes difficult to interpret. It is important to notice that
mobility diameter, contrary to the gyration radius, depends on the flow
regime. Also, the electrical mobility Ze is found to be proportional
to the particle diffusion coefficient  since Ze = ne
 with kB the
kB T
Boltzmann constant and T  the temperature.

2.3.1. Flow regime and its impact on particle mobility

The  interactions  between  aerosol  particles  and  the  molecules  of
surrounding gas, such as heat, mass, and momentum transfer, depend
on  the  flow  regime.  The  flow  regime  is  characterized  by  the  flow
Knudsen  number  defined  as  the  ratio  of  the  mean-free-path  of  gas
molecules λg to the particle mobility radius Rm, Knf

= λg∕Rm [140].

The mobility of a particle is related to its drag in the flow and
> 10, which is termed
hence depends on the flow regime. For Knf
free-molecular  regime,  gas  molecules  move  ballistically  and  nearly
collisionlessly (between gas molecules) and the collision rate between
gas molecules and the particle is the controlling factor determining
< 0.01,  the  momentum  exchange
the  particle  drag  force.  For  Knf
between the particle and the surrounding gas molecules takes place in
the continuum regime where the drag experienced by the particle is
controlled by the gas viscosity. In the transition regime of intermediate
flow Knudsen numbers, characterized by 0.1 < Knf
< 10, there are
collisions among gas molecules and between gas molecules and the
particle; the particle drag in these flow regimes depends on the flow
Knudsen number and is determined by both the gas viscosity and the
collision  rate  between  gas  molecules  and  the  particle.  For  a  given
particle, the flow regime can vary with the temperature and pressure
of  the  gaseous  medium  through  their  strong  impact  on  the  mean-
free-path of the gas molecules. The mobility diameter of DLCA fractal
agglomerates formed by monodisperse primary particles in different
flow regimes has been reviewed by Sorensen [140].

2.3.2. Mobility of fractal aggregates

When  particles  are  not  spherical,  the  dynamic  shape  factor  can
be  used  (if  known)  to  interpret  the  mobility  diameter.  Indeed,  the
shape factor χ of a particle is defined as the ratio of the drag force
on  the  particle  divided  by  the  drag  force  on  the  particle’s  volume
equivalent sphere [141]. For soot aggregates, this parameter increases
quite linearly with the mobility diameter to reach χ ≈ 2 for Dm = 200
nm [142], meaning that the actual aerodynamic force can be up to
twice that of the equivalent sphere due to the larger surface exposed
by the aggregate to the surrounding gas. Unfortunately, there is no
theoretical approach to provide an analytical expression of the shape
factor. For complex morphologies, this practical function has to be
determined  empirically  or  based  on  numerical  simulations  of  drag
forces.

Another way to express the morphological deviation from a sphere
is to determine the particle’s effective density defined as the particle
mass m divided by the volume of a sphere having the same mobility
diameter, ρeff = 6m∕πD3
m. It is noted that unless otherwise explicitly
indicated,  all  the  primary  particles  are  assumed  to  have  the  same
physical and chemical properties throughout this review. The particle
effective  density  can  be  measured  by  coupling  a  DMA  and  a  mass
spectrometer,  such  as  a  centrifugal  particle  mass  analyzer  (CPMA)
or an APM. For spherical particles, such a measurement corresponds
to the bulk density of particle material and is therefore independent
of the particle diameter. For fractal aggregates, experiments establish
a power-law decrease of ρeff as a function of Dm [143] taking the
form ρeff ∝ Dα−3
m , where α is called scanning exponent. As for the
shape factor, there is no theoretical approach enabling an analytical
expression of the scaling exponent. The empirical observation of this
power  law  suggests  that  mobility  diameter,  similar  to  the  gyration

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 110 (2025) 101234

radius, evolves in a power-law of the number of primary spheres. The
same conclusion has been reached by Sorensen [140], who provided
a  review  focusing  on  the  link  between  the  mobility  diameter  of  a
DLCA fractal agglomerate, i.e., for Df p = 1.78 and kf p = 1.3, and
its number of primary spheres or the corresponding gyration radius.
Sorensen concluded that in the continuum flow regime characterized
by small Knudsen numbers (Kn ≪ 0.1), the mobility diameter can be
expressed as

 It is important to notice that the Knudsen number Kn is based on
the aggregate mobility diameter Kn(Dm) = 2λg∕Dm (λg refers to the
mean free-path of the surrounding gas molecules). A more detailed
description of flow regimes is given in Section 2.3.1. It is also often con-
sidered in the literature that the mobility diameter in the free-molecular
and transition flow regimes is related to the particle projected area

The projected area can be estimated based on Monte Carlo sampling
and averaged over 5 random orientations of each aggregate/agglom-
erate [147]. The Dm of EDEM-derived aggregates and agglomerates
obtained using Eq. (9) can be related to their volume-area equivalent
number, Nva, and diameter Dva or the Sauter mean diameter, D32,
of the soot primary particles by [94] (note the slight change of Np
exponent as compared to Eq. (7)):

Dm = DvaN 0.45
va .

(10)

For agglomerates containing monodisperse primary particles in point-
contact, Nva = Np and Dva = Dp. Eq. (10) was derived by fitting the Dm
of EDEM-derived aggregates and agglomerates [94]. It should be noted
that Eq. (10) is similar to the power law proposed by Sorensen [140]
(Eq.  (7))  for  agglomerates  in  the  free  molecular  regime.  However,
Eq. (10) has been derived for aggregates and agglomerates in both the
free molecular and transition regimes.  In addition, unlike Eq. (7) that is
valid for monodisperse soot primary particles, Eq. (10) has been derived
for polydisperse ones [94]. So, the difference between Eqs. (7) and (10)
is based on physics. Eq. (10) has been validated with measurements
of soot nanoparticles produced in premixed [81], diffusion [94], and
spray  [148]  flames.  Eq.  (10)  is  also  in  excellent  agreement  with
data  from  agglomerates  of  inorganic  nanoparticles  [149],  including
silica [150], zirconia [147], gold [151], and silver [152] nanoparticles.
By comparing the effective density measurements of different kinds
of fractal aggregate, Yon et al. [153] proposed a semi-empirical model
of the effective density,

From this last study [153], the mobility diameter of a fractal aggregate,
and therefore its aerodynamic force, can be expressed as a function of

Eqs.   (12)  and  (13)  derived  from  the  semi-empirical  Eq.   (11)  have
been adjusted based on experimental measurements. The authors con-
sidered polydisperse primary particles by imposing the mean Dp in
√
Eqs. (11)–(13) to be the mass equivalent diameter ( 3
p) [153]. This
expression has been found in good accordance with Eq. (6) and (7) for
asymptotic regimes and was implemented in MCAC [95]. Nevertheless,
it is important to point out that the use of Eqs. (10) and (13) can
produce different results. Indeed, Fig.  6 compares both models as well
as Sorensen’s expressions (Eq. (6)) by plotting the mobility diameter
divided by the primary sphere diameter as a function of the number
of primary spheres per aggregate. Because the model of Yon et al.
depends on both the flow regime and Dp, we report the comparison
for different typical values of temperature and Dp, including ambient
temperature, as in the case of SMPS measurements for example, and
also at a typical flame temperature of 1830 K. The model proposed
by Yon et al. provides smaller ratios at flame temperatures. However,
it converges towards Sorensen and Kelesidis et al. ratios at ambient
temperatures, in particular for large Dp, i.e., in the transition flow
regime.

The  above  discussion  shows  that  converting  a  size  distribution
expressed  in  gyration  diameter  (a  purely  morphological  parameter)
into a distribution in mobility diameter (which, in addition to being
shape-dependent, also depends on the flow regime) is not straightfor-
ward. Different relationships exist for different flow regimes, giving
a different influence to certain parameters. For example, Bouaniche
et al. [108] have shown that the agreement between their simulations
and SMPS measurements can be excellent as a function of the diameter
of the primary spheres considered for the conversion. It should also
be considered that temperature plays an important role in the flow
regime and that the latter is naturally different in flame compared to
the temperature of the effluent transmitted to the granulometer which
analyzes the mobility at room temperature.

Optical techniques based on light scattering are therefore preferred
for a comparison of simulated soot particle size distribution with exper-
iments because they are in-situ and depend only on the morphology of

12

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 110 (2025) 101234

the particles. But it is true that the implementation of optical techniques
is often much more difficult than the installation of a sampling probe
and a commercial granulometer. A comparison with ex-situ measure-
ments of the SMPS type are naturally possible but require a conversion
based on laws that must be systematically explained as well as the
quantities considered, such as T , Df , Dp, Cc (Kn).

2.4. Aggregate size distribution: self-preserving, log-normal, and linkage to
particle kinetics

Soot particles are generally less than 1 μm making sedimentation
negligible.  The  size  distribution,  generally  expressed  in  dn∕d ln(D),
where n represents the number concentration and D the considered
diameter of the particle (can be gyration, mobility, aerodynamic or
volume-equivalent  sphere)  is  usually  composed  of  two  modes.  The
smaller  one  is  related  to  nuclei  (or  isolated  primary  spheres)  that
quickly coalesce and coagulate to form the larger mode (accumulation
mode). If the smaller one can be treated as spherical particles, the
second one then corresponds to aggregates. In various flame conditions
(e.g. premixed flames; [154,155]), nanoparticle inception may persist
and take place concurrently with coagulation [156]. This results in
bi-modal  size  distributions  at  small  heights  above  the  burner  and
residence times [156]. Still, these incipient nanoparticles coagulate fast
with the larger soot aggregates [157]. Monte Carlo simulations suggest
that these small nanoparticles do not affect significantly the morphol-
ogy of the particles in the accumulation mode [158]. The distribution
becomes unimodal when the concentration of nuclei or aggregates be-
comes negligible relative to the other. When both co-exist, the smaller
mode is often neglected because its mass fraction is negligible as well
as its contribution to light scattering or laser-induced incandescence
signals. Based on experimental measurements relying on soot sampling
(TEM or SMPS), it is found that both modes can be well modeled by
a log-normal (LN) distribution. Therefore, the driving parameters of
the probability density function are reduced to two parameters: the
geometric mean diameter Dgeo and the geometric standard deviation
σgeo. Although the LN distribution has been commonly assumed, there
is no theoretical explanation to support the log-normal nature of the
size distribution for each mode. For this reason, some authors prefer to
resort to the self-preserving size distribution (SPSD), which is actually
supported by a theory well suited for coalescence and aggregation.

Indeed, the aggregation process is driven by what we call the inter-
particle collision kernel K(Vi, Vj ) that defines the rate at which particles
of volume Vi and Vj collide and stick to form a larger one. According
to [159], it can be related to the product of the diffusion coefficient
and the particle size. The larger a particle is, the smaller its mobility
but  larger  its  cross  section.  The  collision  kernel  is  thus  a  balance
between mobility and cross section. Thus, it depends on the particle
size, density, and flow regime. If for given fractal aggregates and a
given flow regime, both the diffusion coefficient and particle size can
be expressed as power-laws of the number of primary spheres, then the
collision kernel can also be expressed as a power-law of the particle
volume and therefore such aggregation can be seen as an auto-similar
process described as:

K(γVi, γVj ) = γ λK(Vi, Vj ).

(14)

This self-similar approach is an idealized construction that is theoreti-
cally valid only for ideal fractal objects. Nevertheless, it is the basis for
the analytical expression of the size distribution, as explained below.
In this equation, λ is called the degree of homogeneity. For λ = 0,
the collision probability of two particles is not scale dependent. For
example, whatever the volume of a particle, the probability to collide
with a particle having twice its volume is the same. If λ is larger than
1, the collision will be more efficient at larger scales whereas if it is
smaller than 1, on the contrary, the collisions will be more efficient at
smaller scales. From this point of view, it seems logical to state that
a larger λ leads to a broader size distribution. The dependence of λ

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 110 (2025) 101234

on the flow regime and on the fractal dimension has been investigated
by different authors [159–161]. Based on a scaling analysis, Pierce
et al. [162] proposed different expressions of the dependence of λ on
the fractal dimension for different regimes of aggregation. According
to this study, λ is found to be about 0.55 for ballistic aggregation, 0.22
and 0 in the continuum flow regime in the intermediate and diluted
environment, respectively, and −0.14 and −0.36 in Epstein regime (free-
molecular particle-gas interaction regime, Kn ≫ 10) in the intermediate
and diluted environment, respectively.

This auto-similar property of the kernels enables an analytic solu-
tion of the population balance equation. Recently, it has been shown
that whatever the considered diameter, the SPSD can be expressed
by a Generalized Gamma function [96]. We report here the generic
expression of the probability density function expressed in log scale:

where  dn  corresponds  to  the  concentration  of  particles  whose  size
parameter x (namely either the number of primary spheres Np, the vol-
ume equivalent diameter Dv, the gyration diameter Dg, or the mobility
diameter Dm) falls in the range [x, x + dx]. X = x∕ ̃x is a normalized
form of the size parameter with  ̃xp = ̄xp representing the moment
at order p of the selected size parameter. p is a dimension parameter
depending on x equal to 1, 3, Df  and Df m (also called scaling exponent
and determined by effective density measurements) for Np, Dv, Dg
and Dm, respectively. Parameters a and d are respectively defined by
a = (1 − λ)−1∕p and d = p(1 − λ).

The kinetic exponent z = (1 − λ)−1 is a power-law time depen-
dence of the particle growth by aggregation process valid after the
establishment of the auto-similarity. The results provided by Wang and
Sorensen [159] can be generalized to any size parameter:

̃x ∝ tz∕p.

(16)

It  indicates  that  aggregation  is  faster  for  ballistic  aggregation  and
slower in Epstein flow regime (larger z). It is also slower for large
p,  meaning  that  the  growth  rate  of  the  sphere  equivalent  volume
diameter appears slower than the growth rate of the gyration diameter.
Nevertheless, as shown by Eq. (15), when represented as a function of
the normalized size parameter X, the size distribution has no apparent
time dependency and adopts what is called a Self-Preserving nature.

From Eq. (15), one can derive (see S1 of the Supporting Material)
the analytical expression of moments at order q of the size parameter x,
the geometric mean xgeo and the geometric standard deviation σx,geo:

Based on Eq. (17c), it is interesting to notice that dispersion of the
size distribution, usually quantified by the geometric standard devia-
tion σx,geo, only depends on λ and p. This explains, for example, why
the gyration geometric standard deviation is larger than the mobility
ones σg,geo > σm,geo.

Fig.  7 reports the log-normal and SPSD expressed in gyration diam-
eter having the same  ̃Dg and σg,geo for different regimes of agglomera-
tion. Whatever the considered regime, the decrease of distribution after
the peak at large diameters is always steeper for the SPSD than LN. This
is the expected result of the self-preserving distribution under given  ̃Dg
and σg,geo. On one hand, the SPSD becomes increasingly asymmetric
with increasing λ. Specifically, as λ increases, the SPSD increases more
gradual towards the peak and then decreases more rapidly after the

deviations expressed as a function of the gyration diameter for different regimes of

peak with increasing Dg. Regardless of the values of Df  and λ, the
SPSD always peaks at Dg = ̃Dg. On the other hand, the LN distribution
remains symmetric and always peaks at a Dg < ̃Dg. These different
features of the SPSD and LN distribution explain why the decrease of
SPSD after the peak is always steeper than the LN distribution when
the  two  distributions  have  the  same  ̃Dg  and  σg,geo.  It  is  important
to recall that the theory behind the SPSD only considers aggregation
occurring at a fixed flow regime (constant λ). In reality, the flow regime
and aggregation regime evolve with time due to the increase of the
particle size [96], and the local thermodynamic conditions also evolve.
Moreover, other phenomena, such as inception and surface growth, also
affect the size distribution [163]. These concurrent complex processes
on soot particle size distributions may explain why most of the mea-
surements are better modeled by a log-normal size distribution [164]
with a longer tail. As noticed in [123], this difference is of importance
when considering the computation of high order moments, which are
required for example when evaluating the light scattering cross section.
In any case, there has been no consensus to date on the preference
to be given to one model over the other. The lognormal law seems
empirically to correspond better to granulometric measurements based
on the mobility diameter, the difficulty of interpretation of which has
been discussed earlier. The self-similar law has the advantage of being
based on a theoretical aggregation model. However, this may not be
sufficient  when  other  mechanisms  are  simultaneously  involved.  An
effort must be made to better determine which law should be used for
given conditions.

2.5. Anti-correlation of Df p and kf p

The  population  based  fractal  dimension  Df p  and  prefactor  kf p
have  been  found  to  be  anti-correlated  (see  Fig.   8)  as  initially  sug-
gested by Sorensen and Roberts [165] who analyzed 24 ensembles
of 3-dimensional DLCA simulations and obtained Df p and kf p from a
log–log fit of Eq. (1). In this context, the power-law kf p = 4.46D−2.08
was  proposed  by  Ehrl  et  al.  [166],  which  is  valid  in  the  range  of
Df p ∈ [1.6, 3.0].  This  empirical  power-law  is  found  in  reasonably

proceeds simultaneously with the transformation of chemical compo-
sitions both on the particle surface and the interior [189–191]. The
evolution of soot maturity results in various changes in the physical
and chemical properties as well as the internal nanostructure of soot
as discussed in [14,189,190]. It is useful to recall that surface growth
causes an increase in the amount of soot mass but does not change
the particle number density. In contrast, coagulation, which refers to
the  collision  and  sticking  or  coalescence  of  particles,  increases  the
volume  of  individual  particles  involved  in  coagulation,  reduces  the
particle number density, but does not change the amount of soot mass.
The literature on soot particle coagulation, coagulation efficiency, and
surface growth are discussed in the following sub-sections.

agglomerates [170] and more recently in the transition between BLCA
and DLCA regimes [96].

3. Overview of soot particle growth

There are various physical and chemical processes associated with
soot formation in hydrocarbon flames. The main processes include [21,
23,30] (i) fuel pyrolysis and formation of radicals and intermediate
hydrocarbon  species,  (ii)  formation  of  benzene,  (iii)  formation  and
growth of PAHs, (iv) formation of incipient soot particles (soot in-
ception),  which  then  evolve  into  solid  primary  soot  particles  after
they reach the critical coalescence diameter through coalescence and
surface growth and carbonization/graphitization, (v) particle growth
through simultaneous surface growth and coagulation and formation
of fractal-like soot aggregates through aggregation of soot particles,
and finally (vi) oxidation and oxidation-induced fragmentation of soot
aggregates. Among these processes, formation of incipient soot par-
ticles, i.e., inception, marks the transition from gas-phase precursor
species (PAHs and aliphatic-linked PAHs) to condensed phase particles
or the birth of particles, and initiates the subsequent surface growth
and particle dynamics. Given the focus of this review is the progress
in the prediction of soot particle aggregation in the presence of surface
growth (step v in the overall soot formation process), the aim of this
section is to provide an overview of the physical and chemical processes
involved  in  the  early  stage  of  evolution  of  incipient  soot  particles,
namely coagulation and surface growth. Therefore, soot inception, soot
oxidation, and oxidation-induced fragmentation will not be included in
this section. Comprehensive reviews and some recent studies of these
processes can be found in the literature. For soot inception, various
mechanisms and models have been proposed and reviewed in the sem-
inal monographs [22,23], and several excellent reviews [21,26–29].
For soot oxidation and oxidation-induced fragmentation, experimen-
tal measurements and models of soot oxidation [155,172–180] and
oxidation-induced fragmentation [181–188] have also been extensively
conducted in the literature.

Once incipient soot particles of about 1 to 3 nm in volume-equiv
alent diameter are formed, they undergo concurrent processes of co-
agulation, carbonization/graphitization, surface growth, and oxidation.
Although soot oxidation also takes place in the early stage of soot for-
mation, it plays a less important role compared to soot surface growth
because soot formation takes place under locally fuel rich conditions.
However, this by no means suggests that soot oxidation is not important
or can be neglected. Carbonization/graphitization of soot particles also

Soot particle coalescence has long been believed to play an impor-
tant role in the early stage of soot formation, e.g. [21,32]. Coalescence
instantaneously enlarges the size of young soot particles through com-
plete merging of two or more liquid-like incipient soot particles upon
collision, reduces the particle number density and available surface
area, causing a profound influence on soot surface growth and the
predicted primary particle size [42,192–194]. The liquid-like nature
of incipient soot particles are revealed from TEM and atomic force
microscopy (AFM) images (see [29] and references cited therein). Due
to the rapid evolution of incipient soot particles and the concurrent
presence of many complex processes during soot formation in flames,
it is very challenging to obtain direct experimental evidence of soot
particle coalescence, though we recognize that the difference in coales-
cence between PAH clusters and incipient soot particles has not been
made clear. Instead, the importance of coalescence has been assessed
indirectly by comparing the predicted soot particle primary diameter
distribution and/or particle number density against experimental data
in laminar flames [42,193–195]. Smooke et al. [195] assumed that
primary  particles  undergo  either  coalescence  if  their  diameters  are
below the cut-off value of 25 nm or otherwise agglomeration when
the diameters of colliding primary particles are larger than the cut-
off value. Zhang et al. [42] employed a cut-off size-based soot particle
coalescence model to investigate the influence of coalescence on the
predicted average number of primary particles per aggregate, mean
primary particle diameter, number density of primary particles (npp), as
well as soot volume fraction using a detailed soot model and a cut-off
soot diameter of 3 nm. They found that consideration of coalescence
predicted larger Dp, but lower Np, npp, and fv and the quantitative
influence of particle coalescence is also strongly affected by the as-
sumed particle coagulation efficiency. Veshkini et al. [192] proposed
a collision-driven finite-rate sintering coalescence model based on the
conservation of primary particle number density. The sintering rate is
expressed as [192,196]
∂np

where  np
i   and  na
i   are  the  number  density  of  primary  particles  and

where the pre-exponential factor As = 7.44 × 108 s/(K cm4) and the
activation energy Es = 3.31 × 104 K. This characteristic coalescence
time implies that the sintering/coalescence can be neglected when the
temperature decreases below 1500 K or the primary particle diameter
increases above 40 nm [192]. Veshkini et al. also considered a cut-off
coalescence model with a cut-off diameter of 20 nm. The coalescence
models were implemented into the CoFlame code [43] to investigate
the effects of coalescence modeling on the prediction of soot volume
fraction and particle properties (Dp, npp, and Np) in the Santoro flame
(laminar coflow ethylene/air diffusion flame). They concluded that it

is necessary to take into account soot particle coalescence to better
predict the primary particle diameter and the primary particle number
density against available experimental data.

In the detailed stochastic population balance (DSPB) model devel-
oped by Kraft and co-workers, sintering has been assumed to be an
important process in the early stage of soot formation and the transition
from coalescence/sintering to agglomeration/aggregation was modeled
by using a finite-rate sintering model [98,194,197,198]. The sintering
rate is given as [98,197]

where  As  (in  s/m)  is  the  pre-exponential  factor,  di,j  is  the  smaller
diameter of the two neighboring primary particles, Es is the activation
energy, and dcrit is the critical primary particle diameter below which
primary particles are assumed to be liquid-like and will sinter instanta-
neously, i.e., undergoing coalescence. Therefore, coalescence is simply
a special case in this sintering model. A similar sintering model has
been adapted by D’Anna and co-workers in their kinetic sectional soot
model [72,73]. Chen et al. [197] obtained the best fit sintering model
parameters by reproducing the measured soot particle size distribution
in a laminar premixed flame as: As = 1.1 × 10−14 s∕m, Es = 799 kJ∕mol,
and dcrit = 1.58 nm. The sintering model has recently been used by Hou
et al. [98] and Botero et al. [194] to predict soot primary particle size
distributions (PPSDs) in both premixed and diffusion flames. Sensitivity
studies were also conducted to investigate the effect of sintering model
parameters to the predicted soot primary particle size distributions.
They found that the predicted primary particle size distributions are
sensitive to the sintering model parameters. Using the DSPB method
and the soot sintering model given in Eq. (20), Hou et al. [98] modeled
the PPSD in the burner-stabilized premixed ethylene stagnation flame
investigated experimentally by Wang et al. [199] (Flame A3 in [199],
stagnation plate height 1.2 cm). The computed PPSDs were sensitive to
the rate of production of A4, coagulation rate, and surface growth rate.
They compared the rates of A4 production (the dimerization of A4 was
the inception step), collision rate, sintering rate, and the mole fraction
of H against the residence time shown in Fig.  9.

The rate of A4 production (the solid red line) is an indication of
soot inception rate. The collision rate (the blue dashed line) repre-
sents  the  sum  of  the  rates  of  all  collision  processes,  i.e.,  inception
(collisions between PAH molecules), condensation (collisions between
PAH  molecules  and  particles),  and  coagulation  (collisions  between
particles). The sintering rate, represented by the dash-dotted line, is cal-
culated from Eq. (20) with Di,j evaluated as the average diameter of all

primary particles. The sintering rate displays a very steep decrease with
residence time: before about 30 ms it is several orders of magnitudes
higher than A4 production and collision; but after 30 ms, it becomes
almost negligible. This behavior of the sintering rate reflects its strong
sensitivity to the primary particle diameter due to its nearly exponential
variation with Di,j . The mole fraction of H atoms shown in Fig.  9 is
an indication of the rate of soot surface growth due to the important
role  of  H  abstraction  reactions  in  the  HACA  mechanism.  The  rates
shown in Fig.  9 suggest that before 30 ms coalescence and sintering are
the dominant processes. However, coagulation (aggregation) becomes
dominant after 30 ms. The rapid decrease of the sintering rate also
suggests that the transition from coalescence/sintering to agglomera-
tion/aggregation occurs rapidly, i.e., over a very short time of the order
of few milliseconds. Hou et al. [98] also analyzed the evolution of
average primary particle diameter Dp and number of primary particles
per aggregate Np. These results are shown in Fig.  10.

It can be seen from Fig.  10, the growth of primary particles can be
divided into three stages from the variation rate marked by the vertical
dashed lines. In the first stage (below 30 ms), primary particle growth
is attributed to rapid coalescence/sintering and surface growth. Soot
particles remain spherical at this stage because the average number of
primary particle per aggregate remains at 1. In the second stage (30
to 50 ms), the variation rate of Dp is much slower, suggesting that
both sintering and surface growth rates are considerably lower than
those in the first stage. In the last stage beyond 50 ms, the average
primary particle diameter remains nearly constant, consistent with the
negligible surface growth and sintering rates shown in Fig.  9. At this
stage, coagulation (aggregation) is the dominant particle process and
the average number of primary particle per aggregate increases linearly
with time. In Fig.  10, the evolution of average primary particle diam-
eter without coalescence/sintering (the blue dash-dotted line) is also
plotted to show the relative importance of surface growth and sintering
to the growth of primary particle diameter. Without coalescence/sinter-
ing, surface growth is the only mechanism for the growth of primary
particles and the average diameter reached about 5 nm in the third
stage. By contrast, when coalescence/sintering was taken into account,
the average primary particle diameter in the third stage reached about
9.3 nm, nearly twice as large as that without coalescence/sintering and
in better agreement with the experimental data.

In another recent numerical study, Sun et al. [196] extended the
conservative finite-volume one-PBE (CFV-1PBE) sectional method to

CFV-2PBE  by  solving  an  additional  transport  equation  for  the  pri-
mary particle number density in each section. They investigated the
importance of finite-rate sintering, which was called fusing in [196],
of primary particles within aggregates in the Santoro laminar coflow
ethylene/air diffusion flame using both the CFV-1PBE and CFV-2PBE
sectional  methods  coupled  with  a  detailed  soot  kinetic  model.  The
results are highlighted in Fig.  11. Their results showed that coales-
cence/sintering significantly affect the predicted particle number den-
sity (primary particle and aggregate), soot volume fraction, and soot
particle size (aggregate size distribution, primary particle size, average
number of primary particles per aggregate) and the results are sensitive
to  the  sintering  models  and  the  assumed  activation  energy.  These
findings are overall similar to those of Veshkini et al. [192].

Although the above-discussed studies are useful to illustrate the
potential importance of coalescence/sintering to the prediction of var-
ious soot properties in laminar flames, the results and findings from
these studies must be considered model specific. The main concern of
the methodology for assessing the importance of coalescence/sintering
lies in the uncertainties in other sub-models of the overall soot model,
such as the PAH formation sub-mechanism of the gas-phase mechanism,
the soot inception model, and the soot particle coagulation efficiency.
Given the significant uncertainties in PAH formation sub-mechanism
and  soot  inception  model  [26,27],  the  coalescence  model  may  be

considered as an additional tunable term in an overall soot model at
the current stage of soot modeling.

To gain fundamental insights into the coalescence process of in-
cipient soot particles, Hou et al. [193] have recently investigated the
coalescence  and  sintering  of  PAH  clusters  of  3  to  6  nm  over  the
temperature range of 300 to 750 K using MD. Later, Sharma et al. [191]
also  studied  the  coalescence/sintering  of  incipient  soot  particles  of
about 1 to 3.5 nm over the temperature range of 800 to 1800 K using
reactive MD. Hou et al. [193] found that the sintering rate of two
PAH clusters is strongly dependent on temperature. When the sintering
temperature is higher than the melting temperature of the PAH clusters,
reported to range between 250 and 575 K for clusters composed of 50
to 500 PAH molecules according to Chen et al. [200], the characteristic
sintering  time  τs  is  about  10−2 ns.  In  contrast,  when  the  sintering
temperature is below the melting temperature, τs is much longer with
τs > 5 ns. The implications of these results are that PAH clusters sinter
instantaneously at flame temperatures. Based on the results of reactive
MD  simulations,  on  the  other  hand,  Sharma  et  al.  concluded  that
the coalescence/sintering rate depends on temperature and the cluster
structure and composition. Specifically, at relatively low temperatures
of about 800 to 1000 K incipient soot particles coalesce instantly. At
higher temperatures (1200 to 1600 K), incipient soot particles are less
likely to coalesce due to the higher aromatic to aliphatic carbon ratios,

16

F. Liu et al.

which correspond to more rigid particles. Larger particles consisting of
more than 1300 C atoms (volume equivalent diameter about 2.5 nm)
did not coalesce within the simulation time (up to 5 ns). The findings of
Sharma et al. tend to support the conjecture that soot particles do not
sinter [30,59], or that the characteristic sintering time increases very
rapidly with increasing the primary particle size so that the transition
from coalescence to agglomeration takes place nearly instantaneously.
Nevertheless,  the  relevance  of  sintering  to  soot  formation  deserves
further  research  and  more  discussion  of  sintering  will  be  given  in
Section 7.

3.2. Collision and sticking probability

The coagulation rate of young soot (Dp <∼ 10 nm) is determined
not only by their collision frequency, but also by their collision and
sticking probability, simply because the coagulation rate is the product
of collision frequency and sticking probability. While the theory of
collision frequency has been well established, e.g. [38,201], the sticking
probability of young soot is subject to large uncertainty and very dif-
ferent values varying over two-orders of magnitude have been assumed
in both macro- and meso-scale modeling of soot particle dynamics, as
discussed by Huo et al. [202]. The sticking probability strongly influ-
ences the prediction of soot particle size distributions in laminar sooting
flames, e.g. [202–205]. In the context of soot particle dynamics, almost
all the studies conducted to date have considered neutral or uncharged
soot particles and implicitly assumed that the collision probability of
either primary particles or aggregates is unity with perhaps the only
exception of a recent study by Morán et al. [206], who investigated the
collision and sticking of charged young soot particles and quantified
both the collision and sticking probability. Collision occurs when the
relative kinetic energy of the two colliding particles along the direction
of collision is higher than the repulsive energy barrier. When colli-
sion occurs, there are two possible outcomes: the two particles either
stick or rebound. The results of Morán et al. showed that collision is
always successful for uncharged or oppositely charged soot particles.
Their results of the sticking probability will be discussed later. The
sticking probability is also termed coagulation probability, coagulation
efficiency, or collision efficiency in the literature, e.g. [202,207–209].
To unify the different terminologies used in the literature to describe
the probability of a successful sticking of two particles upon collision,
the sticking probability is used throughout this review. Soot particles
are assumed electrically uncharged in the following discussion.

The van der Waals attraction and Born repulsion are commonly
regarded as the potentials explaining the sticking of particles upon
collisions [202,206,207,209,210]. These studies are all based on the
pair-wise  Lennard-Jones  potential  between  two  atoms  or  molecules
expressed as,
[( σab
rab

,

(21)

−

where ε is the potential well depth, σab is the finite distance between
the two interacting objects at which the interaction potential is zero,
and rab is the center-to-center distance between the two objects. The
interaction energy between two solid particles can be evaluated by
integrating the Lennard-Jones potential over the entire volumes of the
two particles [202,206,209],

Φ(a1, a2) = q1q2 ∫

where ai, qi, and Vi (i = 1, 2) are respectively the radius, atom or
molecule  number  density,  and  volume  of  particle  i.  The  analytical
expression for the double integration in Eq. (22) can be found in Hou
et al. [209] and Huo et al. [202]. Caution should be taken as the
separation distance between the two colliding particles was defined
differently in these two studies. Soot particle collisions are complex
and may not necessarily result in sticking upon collisions due to the
thermal rebound effect, especially for incipient soot particles of a few

nanometers in diameter at flame temperatures.  D’Alessio et al. [207]
measured low and strongly size-dependent sticking probabilities of soot
particles with a diameter below 10 nm: it increases exponentially from
about 0.002 at D = 2 nm to nearly unity at about D = 10 nm.  The ex-
perimental results of D’Alessio et al. have later been used to formulate
soot sticking probability models [208,211]. Subsequent experimental
studies by D’Alessio and co-workers have also observed significantly
small sticking probabilities for soot particles in the above mentioned
size  range,  finding  good  agreement  between  simulations  based  on
D’Alessio et al. [207] sticking probability model and experiments based
on DMA and AFM [212,213]. Interestingly, Sirignano and D’Anna [204]
have  experimentally  observed  a  degradation  of  coagulation  of  soot
particles with diameter between 2–4 nm when temperature was in-
creased from 300 K to 600 K in a tubular reactor. It is noticed that
increasing temperature causes two competing effects. On one hand,
with increasing temperature the kinetic energy of colliding particles
is enhanced and so is the probability of the particle to escape the
interaction potential well, leading to a lower sticking probability. On
the  other  hand,  increasing  temperature  also  increases  the  collision
frequency. The experimental results of Sirignano and D’Anna imply that
temperature has a much stronger impact on the sticking probability
than on the collision frequency for these very small particles, at least
over  the  temperature  range  investigated.  The  recent  study  by  Huo
et al. [202], who showed that the coagulation rate (the product of colli-
sion frequency and sticking probability) decreases monotonically with
increasing temperature for collisions of small particles, has confirmed
this conjecture.

For Brownian coagulation the sticking probability of two colliding

particles in the free-molecular regime is given as [207,210]:

where Φ0 is the potential well depth, kB is the Boltzmann constant,
and  T   is  the  particle  temperature.  The  potential  well  depth  Φ0  is
the minimum potential energy where dΦ(a1, a2)∕dh12 = 0 (h12 is the
distance between the two colliding particles). D’Alessio et al. [207]
were the first to propose using Eq. (23) to model soot sticking prob-
ability based on the study of Narsimhan and Ruckenstein [210]. More
recently, by assuming a mass density of 700 kg/m3, C/H = 1.8, and
uniform distributions of C and H atoms inside spherical soot particles,
Hou et al. [209] reported the potential well depth of two colliding
soot particles with diameters between 1 and 15 nm through detailed
calculations considering all pair-wise interactions between C and H
atoms, i.e., C–C, H-H, H-C, and C-H, within the two particles expressed
as

Φ = ΦCC + ΦCH + ΦHC + ΦHH

(24)

where the first and second subscript refer the atoms in the first and
second  particle,  respectively.  For  example,  ΦCH   is  the  interaction
energy between C atoms in particle 1 and H atoms in particle 2. The
resultant potential well depth Φ0 was fitted as a polynomial function
of the reduced collision diameter Dc = D1D2∕(D1 + D2), with D1 and
D2 being the diameters of the two colliding particles, as
Φ0(Dc ) = −5.5373 × 10−21 + 1.1394 × 10−20Dc

+ 1.1244 × 10−21D2

c − 6.6891 × 10−23D3
c
where the unit of Φ0 and Dc is J and nm, respectively. Using Eqs.
(23) and (25), Hou et al. [209] obtained the sticking probability of
small soot particles shown in Fig.  12. The collision efficiency (stick-
ing probability) of soot decreases with decreasing particle sizes but
increases with decreasing temperature. For example, at flame temper-
atures the collision efficiency decreases quickly from about unity to
about 0.2 when the reduced collision diameter decreases from 7 nm
to about 1 nm. Although the decreasing trend of ηs with decreasing the
reduced collision diameter is consistent with the experimental results
of D’Alessio et al. [207], the rate and extent of decrease are much

smaller than the experimental data. For example, at 2 nm and 1500 K
the calculated ηs by Hou et al. [209] is about 0.25, while the measured
sticking probability by D’Alessio et al. [207] is about 2×10−3. This large
discrepancy in ηs between the numerical results of Hou et al. and the
experimental data of D’Alessio et al. was not explained in the study of
Hou et al. [209]. Although the assumed mass density of incipient soot
of 700 kg/m3 is clearly too low, the sensitivity study of Hou et al. [209]
suggests that the uncertainty in the assumed soot mass density or C/H
ratio cannot explain the large discrepancy between their numerical
results and the experimental data of D’Alessio et al. Hou et al. [209]
also showed that accounting for the size dependent collision efficiency
has a significant influence on the predicted soot particle mobility size
distribution in a premixed flame.

Morán et al. [206] investigated the collision and sticking of charged
soot particles by accounting for both the short-range Lennard-Jones
potential and the long-range electrostatic potential. They derived a dif-
ferent expression for the sticking probability of two colliding particles
from that obtained by Narsimhan and Ruckenstein [210] and used in
previous studies [204,207,209]. The new sticking probability is written
as

tential energy and Ebarr is the long-range repulsive energy associated
with the charged particles. For uncharged soot particles considered
here, Ebarr vanishes and Estick is simply the nondimensional potential
well depth. The sticking probabilities calculated using Eqs.  (23) and
(26)  as  a  function  of  the  nondimensional  potential  well  depth  are
compared in Fig.  13. It is clear from Fig.  13 that the expression of
Morán et al. yields significantly higher ηs and the relative difference
between  the  two  expressions  increases  with  decreasing  the  nondi-
mensional potential well depth. It is also noticed from Fig.  13 that
the expression of Narsimhan and Ruckenstein can indeed return very
low sticking probability down to around 10−3 if the nondimensional
potential well depth can reach a level of 10−2, which corresponds to
a shallow potential well. Using Eq. (26) and the same approach and
Lennard-Jones potential parameters for C–C, H-H, and C-H interactions
as  those  of  Hou  et  al.  [209]  but  more  realistic  soot  mass  density
for calculating the potential between two soot particles, Morán et al.
obtained similar size dependent ηs at T = 1700 K as that obtained by
Hou et al. [209] at T = 1500 K, the red-dashed curve shown in Fig.
12. It is noticed that Hou et al. [209] calculated ηs using Eq. (23).
Based on Fig.  13 and the similar size dependent ηs results of Morán
et al. and Hou et al. [209], we suspect that the significantly higher

sticking probabilities calculated in these two studies may be attributed
to how the potential energy was evaluated, which resulted in high
nondimensional potential well depths, i.e., deep potential wells. Indeed,
even for a small reduced collision diameter of Dc = 2 nm, Eq. (25)
returns a quite large nondimensional potential well depth of Φ0∕(kBT )
= 1.024 (at T = 1500 K), which corresponds to ηs = 0.264 from Eq. (23),
confirming the above conjecture.

The sticking probability of two colliding spherical young soot par-
ticles has also been recently investigated by Huo et al. [202] using
the Lennard-Jones potential and the sticking probability expression of
Narsimhan and Ruckenstein given in Eq. (23). The critical difference
between the study of Huo et al. [202] and that of Hou et al. [209]
lies in how the interaction potential energy between the two colliding
particles was calculated. While Hou et al. [209] obtained the potential
energy between two particles by adding all pair-wise Lennard-Jones
potentials between all the C and H atoms in the two particles given
in Eq. (24) and estimated the number density of C and H atoms from
assumed soot mass density and C/H ratio, Huo et al. [202] calculated
the interaction potential energy of the two colliding particles consid-
ering three cases: carbon–carbon (C-C), benzene-benzene (A1-A1), and
pyrene-pyrene (A4-A4) interaction to approximate the H/C ratio = 0,
1, and an intermediate value of 0.625, respectively. The corresponding
Lennard-Jones potential parameters were given in [202]. In addition,
Huo et al. [202] estimated the atom (C) or molecule (A1 and A4)
number density using qi = 1∕(λVM,i) with λ being a model parameter
representing the molecule packing fraction and VM,i is the volume of a
single atom (C) or molecule (A1 and A4). They calculated the sticking
probability of equal-sized soot particles at T = 1500 K and for three
different values of λ = 1.0, 1.25, and 2.0. Their results for λ = 2.0,
which led to the best agreement with the experimental data of D’Alessio
et al. [207], are shown in Fig.  14. It is worth pointing out that although
λ = 2 led to the best agreement between their calculated sticking
probabilities  (coagulation  efficiency)  and  the  experimental  data  of
D’Alessio et al., it resulted in significantly worse predicted soot particle
size distribution in an ethylene burner-stabilized stagnation premixed
flame and soot volume fraction in a laminar coflow methane diffusion
flame than those assuming λ = 1 and 1.25 (a lower λ causes the sticking
probability to increase more rapidly with increasing particle diameter
D) compared to the experimental results.

It  is  interesting  to  notice  that  the  sticking  probability  obtained
by  Huo  et  al.  [202]  displays  similar  behavior  as  the  experimental
data of D’Alessio et al. namely it decreases nearly exponentially with
decreasing the particle diameter and reaches about 0.002 at D = 2
nm, regardless of the pair of atom (C-C) or molecule (A1-A1 or A4-
A4) considered. Based on the results shown in Figs.  12, 13, and 14
and the above discussion, it is reasonable to conclude that the sticking

probability of young soot particles is sensitive to how the interaction
potential  energy  between  two  colliding  particles  is  calculated  and
Eq. (26) predicts significantly higher values than Eq. (23).

In another recent effort to quantitatively understand the sticking
probability of incipient soot particles, Huo et al. [214] investigated the
coagulation of two cross-linked PAH clusters about 2 nm over the tem-
perature range of 1500 to 2000 K using reactive MD (RMD) simulations,
which presumably can account for the potential interactions of the two
PAH clusters accurately without making the assumptions of rigid sphere
or uniform distributions of C and H atoms in the two colliding PAH
clusters. Limited by the large computing times of RMD simulations and
a large number of simulations for statistical significance, they did not
vary the sizes of PAH clusters. Their results showed that the sticking
probability decreases with increasing the temperature, consistent with
their previous findings [209]. However, the sticking probability of 2 nm
particle predicted by RMD is slightly higher than their earlier result
reported in [209] at the same temperature, resulting in even larger dis-
crepancies with the experimental data of D’Alessio et al. [207]. Clearly,
more research is required to reconcile and understand the differences
in the sticking probabilities of PAH clusters and incipient soot particles
between theoretical calculations and measurements. It is also of interest
to understand quantitatively how the sticking probability affects the
soot particle size distributions in the early stage of growth in flames,
though it is challenging to resolve this issue given the uncertainties in
PAH formation and growth pathways and a lack of clear understanding
of soot inception mechanism.

3.3. Aggregation

3.3.1. Regimes of particle coagulation and its impact on particle–particle
collision

The regimes of particle–particle collisions can be described by the
diffusive Knudsen number defined as the ratio of the particle persistent
distance λp, i.e., the particle’s characteristic distance of momentum
relaxation (also called mean free path in the literature), to the particle
mobility radius Rm, KnD
= λp∕Rm [162]. When λp ≫ Rm, the particle
will experience a ballistic motion, while in the limit λp ≪ Rm, the
particle experiences a diffusive motion. The regime of particle–particle
interaction will define a different collision kernel and the dependence
on the diffusive Knudsen number cannot be neglected. In this con-
text,  numerous  studies  have  reported  a  correction  for  the  collision
kernels as a function of the diffusive Knudsen number starting with
the Fuchs’ flux-matching theory [215] to more recent ones based on
theoretical [216–218] or numerical simulations [219–221].

3.3.2. Aggregation dynamics

The dynamics of soot nanoparticles under the flame thermodynamic
conditions determines their aggregation kinetics and particle morphol-
ogy.  The  key  parameter  describing  such  dynamics  is  the  particle–
particle or diffusive Knudsen number discussed above. As particle grow
through aggregation, their dynamics commonly evolves from ballistic
(Kn,D ≫ 1)  to  transition  regime  (Kn,D ∼ 1).  In  this  context,  the
continuum regime collision kernel (βij,C) between particles i and j is,

βij,C = 4π

kBT
fij

Rc,ij ,

Kn,D ≪ 1

(27)

where  fij = fifj ∕(fi + fj )  is  the  reduced  friction  coefficient,  and
Rc,ij = Rc,i + Rc,j is the combined collision or Smoluchowski radius.
In this regime, the particles moves following diffusive trajectories and
thus their collision kernel can be obtained from the diffusion equation.
Eq.  (27)  is  valid  in  the  diffusive  regime  (Kn,D ≪ 1)  under  dilute
conditions (fv ≪ 1000 ppm) and neglecting external forces such as
van der Waals or electrostatic. We note that the friction coefficient
f depends on the particle-gas or gas Knudsen number Kn which is
the ratio between the gas mean free path and a characteristic particle
radius. As discussed in Section 2.3, dedicated works to determine f
for  fractal-like  aggregates  for  all  Kn  numbers  can  be  found  in  the
literature  [84,222].  Significant  efforts  have  been  made  in  previous
works to accurately determine Rc,i for fractal-like aggregates of dif-
ferent  morphologies  [223],  including  the  aggregate  rotation  [221],
and proposing simplified expressions to ease their implementation in
population balance simulations [224]. Similarly, in the ballistic regime,
the collision kernel βij,B is,

βij,B =

√

8kBT
πmij

PAij ,

Kn,D ≫ 1

(28)

where mij = mimj ∕(mi + mj ) is the reduced mass, and PAij is the com-
bined projected area for the colliding particles i and j. In this regime,
the particle move following ballistic trajectories and the collision kernel
is obtained based on the kinetic theory of gases. Eq. (28) is valid in the
ballistic particle–particle interaction regime Kn,D ≫ 1, under diluted
conditions (fv ≪ 1000 ppm), and neglecting external forces such as
van der Waals or electrostatic. Extensions of Eqs. (27) and (28) to high
concentration (numerical [225] and theoretical [226,227], numerical
including  hydrodynamic  interactions  [228])  and  including  external
forces (numerical, van der Waals [229] and Coulomb [230]) are avail-
able  in  the  literature.  Accurate  determination  of  PAij  was  initially
achieved  by  Zurita-Gotor  and  Rosner  [221]  and  more  recently  im-
proved [223,224,231]. Equations for the transition regime, expressed
as a function of the Kn,D, were initially developed by Fuchs [215]
(flux matching approximation), Dahneke [232] (kinetic theory), and
Sahni [216] (solving the Fokker–Planck equation). Transition regime
collision kernels were initially incorporated in soot agglomeration mod-
eling in 1998 by Kazakov and Frenklach [58] based on the harmonic
mean approach originally proposed by Pratsinis [233] which exhibits
a  maximum  deviation  of  15.4%  regarding  Fuchs’  approach  in  the
transition regime. More recent works, have proposed more accurate
expressions for βij in the transition regime based on Langevin dynamics
simulations [234,235].

3.3.3. Rotation of aggregates and its importance to aggregation process

The rotation of aggregates, as the result of interaction with the
surrounding  gas  or  with  other  clusters,  is  commonly  neglected  in
DEM and MC simulations of soot formation under flame conditions
due to its believed low impact on inter-particle collision frequency
and agglomerates’ morphology. We remark that a random rotation of
aggregates before collisions is allowed in the DSPB simulations [97]. In
addition, Zurita-Gotor and Rosner [221] analytically accounted for ag-
glomerates’ rotation effect on their collision diameters in the transition
particle–particle interaction regime. Langevin dynamics simulations of
agglomeration have found up to 16% increase in effective collision

unreactive aromatic basal planes and reactive free-edge, zig-zag, and
armchair sites. Reactions R1 and R2 are the hydrogen abstraction pro-
cess through which the saturated surface sites are activated by H and
OH radicals to form surface radicals, C∙
s, which can also be deactivated
by combination with H radical through reaction R3. Reaction R4 is the
acetylene addition step to the soot active surface sites through which
soot particles gain mass. The rate of soot particle mass gain by reaction
R4 can be evaluated as [238],

grained models for agglomerates’ rotation friction coefficient in the
transition particle-gas interaction regimes have been developed based
on an extended Kirkwood–Riseman theory [236], that may allow con-
sidering aggregates’ rotation. In addition, the inclusion of rotation may
lead to agglomerates with lower fractal dimensions compared to those
obtained when rotation is neglected [235,237].

3.4. Surface growth

Subsequent to soot inception under fuel-rich conditions, incipient
soot particles grow in size and mass through concurrent heterogeneous
surface reactions with some gaseous hydrocarbon species, PAH adsorp-
tion upon collision with certain PAH species, and coagulation upon
collision with other soot particles. The relative importance of these
processes varies with the particle size, particle number density, and
the local flame conditions (temperature and concentrations of radicals,
C2H2, and PAHs). At later stages of soot formation when soot particles
are transported to locally fuel-lean regions of diffusion flames, soot
oxidation and oxidation-induced fragmentation become dominant.

The hydrogen abstraction acetylene (carbon) addition (HACA) re-
action  sequence  [238–240]  has  been  accepted  to  be  the  dominant
mechanism  for  soot  particle  surface  growth  through  heterogeneous
surface reactions with small hydrocarbon species, predominantly acety-
lene. The reactions involved in soot surface growth and oxidation are
listed in Table  1 following the study by Appel et al. [239]. It is noticed
that the first four reactions constitute the HACA mechanism for soot
surface growth while the last two reactions (R5 and R6) are actually
soot  oxidation  reactions  by  O2  and  OH  and  not  part  of  the  HACA
mechanism.

The kinetics of surface reactions in the HACA mechanism of soot
surface growth are described based on surface sites [238,239]. Surface
sites refer to carbon atoms that can be saturated with hydrogen, Cs−H ,
or dehydrogenated, C∙
s. Soot surface is assumed to be composed of

s  is
on per site basis, [C2H2] is the molar concentration of acetylene, χC∙
the number of dehydrogenated sites per unit surface area, As is the soot
particle surface area available for reactions, np is the particle number
density (m−3), Av is Avogadro number, and αs, the steric factor, is a
parameter between 0 and 1 introduced to account for the probability
of a C2H2 molecule to collide with the reactive edge planes [238].

(30)

where χCs−H  is the number of sites per unit soot particle surface area
and takes the value of 2.3×1015 sites/cm2 [238]. It should be noticed
that this surface site number density was estimated based on a dimer of
benzene and represents its upper limit on soot surface. This is the sec-
ond rationality of introducing the steric factor αs. The third rationality
to introduce αs is to account for dehydrogenation or the decrease in soot
surface reactivity as a result of soot chemical transformation, i.e., soot
evolves from young soot with high H/C ratios to mature soot with low
H/C ratios, which has often been termed soot aging in the literature.
Although the HACA mechanism described in detail by Appel et al.
[239],  along  with  the  rate  constants,  has  been  extensively  used  to
model soot surface growth through C2H2 addition, very different values
or functional expressions of αs have been assumed in different studies
to achieve reasonable agreement with measured soot volume fractions.
Different models of αs as a function of temperature, soot particle size,
or thermal age have been proposed and some of these models can be
found in a recent review [241] and in [242]. An extended expression
of Appel et al. [239] for αs has been recently proposed by Kholghy
and Kelesidis [243]. It is also worth noticing that Chen et al. suggested
that the upper limit of αs is 0.8 to about 0.9 based on a microscopic
analysis  of  accessible  surface  of  homogeneous  coronene  clusters  to
C2H2 molecules [244].  However, none of the proposed αs values or
models can perform equally well for different flame conditions. At the
current stage of soot formation modeling using detailed soot models, αs
has to be treated as a tunable model parameter. This situation may be
attributed to at least the following two factors. First, the mechanisms of
soot mass growth are not fully understood. Second, there are significant
uncertainties in the PAH formation and growth pathways leading to
soot and the associated kinetic parameters. As a result, the value of
αs requires adjustment when the same soot model is coupled with a
different gas-phase reaction mechanism that include PAH formation.

Several attempts have been made to improve the HACA mechanism
documented in [239] for soot surface growth. Besides the attempts
discussed in [241], Wang et al. extended H-abstraction reactions by
three hydrocarbon radicals, namely CH3, C2H, and C3H3, in addition to
H-abstraction by H and OH radicals [245]. This extended HACA mech-
anism has been recently used by Hoerlle and Pereira [246] to model
soot formation in counterflow ethylene non-premixed flames. A very
detailed model of PAH growth in soot particles has been developed by
Celnik et al. [247]. However, this comprehensive PAH and soot growth
model has not gained widespread use in sooting flame modeling, likely
owing  to  its  complexity.  It  is  also  noticed  that  more  detailed  soot
surface reactions than the commonly used HACA mechanism of Appel
et al. [239] given in Table  1 have been proposed and implemented











F. Liu et al.

into sectional soot kinetics models (SSKMs) [69,72,73,211] discussed
in Section 4. These models also emphasized the role of radicals in PAH
growth and soot surface reactions.

In  addition  to  the  HACA  mechanism,  growth  of  soot  particles
through PAH adsorption is another important route for soot particles
to gain mass. This growth mechanism is modeled as collision between
soot particles and the soot precursor PAH species [42,43,198,248,249].
Hence, there is an important difference between the HACA mechanism
and PAH adsorption for soot surface growth: C2H2 molecules can only
be added to dehydrogenated or reactive sites in the HACA mechanism,
but PAH adsorption is not subject to this limitation. The rate of soot
particle mass growth through PAH adsorption can be written as,
̇Ssg,PAH = 2.2ηPAHAv[PAH]βcollnp,

(31)

where the factor 2.2 is an enhancement factor [250], ηPAH is the adsorp-
tion probability, [PAH] is the PAH molar concentration, and βcoll is the
collision frequency between the PAH species and soot particles, which
can be modeled using the free-molecular expression under typical flame
conditions at atmospheric pressure [58,249,251,252],

where mp, Dc,p, mPAH, and Dc,PAH are the mass and collision diameter of

elevated pressures, it is necessary to employ the transition-regime col-
lision frequency approximated as the harmonic mean between the free-
molecular  and  continuum-regime  expressions  [58].  Following  Fren-
klach and Wang [251], the PAH collision diameter is estimated as,

3 Å is the size of a single aromatic ring. For soot ag-
gregates, different collision diameter models have been proposed [231].
However, the collision diameter of a soot aggregate has often been
approximated as the gyration diameter, i.e., Dc,p ≈ Dg [211,249]. It is
noticed that Eq. (31) can be easily generalized to account for adsorption
of multiple PAHs on soot surface.

Similar  to  the  sticking  probability  for  soot  inception  (collision
between PAH soot precursors) and for coalescence (collision between
young soot particles), the adsorption probability ηPAH for the adsorption
of PAHs on soot particle surface is also subject to uncertainty and
very different values have been assumed in different soot models as
discussed in a recent study by Zhou et al. [253]. Zhou et al. [253]
investigated the adsorption probability (also called condensation ef-
ficiency  in  some  literature)  of  benzene,  naphthalene,  pyrene,  and
coronene on quasi soot surface using reactive MD simulations. Their
results showed that the adsorption probability of all the four aromatic
species decreases with increasing temperature, especially for lighter
molecules. These results are expected since with increasing temperature
the molecules have a higher kinetic energy, which results in a higher
probability for the molecules to escape the potential well. Based on
their reactive MD simulation results, Zhou et al. proposed the following
PAH adsorption probability model,

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 110 (2025) 101234

probability model led to good agreement between the prediction and
experimental data, (2) the predicted soot volume fraction evolution is
sensitive to the assumed constant value of ηPAH, and (3) no assumed
constant value of ηPAH can predict the soot volume fraction evolution
well at all three temperatures.

Both HACA and PAH adsorption can be important pathways for soot
surface growth.  However, the relative importance of HACA and PAH
adsorption to soot particle surface growth depends on several factors,
such as the number density of surface sites on soot particle surface,
which is related to the level of soot maturity, and the local flame con-
ditions characterized by pressure, temperature, and concentrations of H
and OH radicals, resonantly stabilized hydrocarbon radicals, acetylene,
and PAHs. It is worth pointing out that the flame structure or the
type of flame also strongly affects the relative importance of HACA
and PAH adsorption to soot surface growth. For example, it has been
well-known that in the laminar coflow ethylene/air diffusion flame at
atmospheric pressure soot surface growth is primarily attributed to the
HACA mechanism along the flame wing, where the temperatures and
H radical concentrations are high, but to PAH adsorption in the flame
centerline region, where the temperatures and H radical concentrations
are low [254]. In contrast, the numerical study of Demarco et al. [255]
has demonstrated that HACA plays a negligible role in soot surface
growth in a laminar coflow inverse diffusion flame. It has also been
shown that the relative importance of PAH adsorption to soot surface
growth is more significantly enhanced with increasing pressure than
the  HACA  mechanism  [256,257].  In  premixed  flames,  the  relative
importance of HACA and PAH adsorption to soot surface growth was
found to depend on the equivalence ratio and the assumption of PAH
adsorption reversibility [258].

A  large  number  of  numerical  studies  showed  that  the  modeled
soot volume fractions are generally significantly underpredicted in the
centerline  region  of  laminar  coflow  normal  diffusion  flames  fueled
with either gaseous hydrocarbons, e.g. [254], or vaporized liquid fu-
els [259,260], using available detailed soot models. This deficiency
of the detailed soot modeling may be partially attributed to uncer-
tainties in PAH formation sub-mechanisms [254,259], PAH sticking
probability (also known as collision efficiency) [202,207,209,261], and
inception models based purely on physical ground. The recently pro-
posed carbon addition hydrogen migration (CAHM) mechanism [262]
may potentially improve the prediction of soot concentration in the
centerline region of laminar coflow normal diffusion flames, since the
CAHM mechanism of soot surface growth does not require radicals to
activate surface sites for acetylene addition. However, the importance
of CAHM in soot modeling has not been adequately evaluated and
is subject to ongoing debate [263]. Likewise, the recently proposed
CHRCR mechanism [264] in PAH growth and soot inception has not
been implemented in detailed soot modeling in hydrocarbon flames and
its importance to soot inception and growth requires further evalua-
tion [265]. It is also noticed that the reversibility of PAH adsorption
on soot particles has drawn attention in recent years [258,266,267].
The reversibility of PAH adsorption on soot surface deserves further
investigations and should be done in conjunction with PAH adsorption
probability.

4. Macroscopic modeling of particle dynamics

In  addition  to  solving  the  conservation  equations  of  mass,  mo-
mentum, energy and species mass fractions, a detailed macroscopic
numerical  simulation  of  sooting  flames  generally  also  requires  the
solution of the population balance equation (PBE) for soot particles. As
mentioned previously, this approach generally does not allow predic-
tion of detailed structure or morphology of individual soot aggregates.
In fact, the starting point of macroscopic modeling of soot particle
dynamics is to first assume the shape of soot particles. Once the particle
shape is assumed, either spheres or fractal aggregates, the modeler will
proceed with either the univariate or the bivariate formulation of the

F. Liu et al.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 110 (2025) 101234

PBE and a proper PBE solving method. When the soot particles are
treated as fractal aggregates, some further assumptions, such as soot
aggregates are formed by point-contact primary particles and have pre-
scribed fractal properties (e.g. fractal dimension and fractal prefactor),
have to be imposed to the PBE solver. The aim of macroscopic modeling
of soot particle dynamics is to predict the particle number density,
particle size, the mean primary particle diameter and the mean number
of primary particle per aggregate if soot particles are assumed fractal
aggregates.

Two types of macro-scale approach to couple the gas-phase conser-
vation equations with the PBE for soot particles have been developed.
The  first  type  explicitly  solves  the  PBE  and  takes  into  account  the
coupling between soot and gas-phase species involved in soot inception,
surface  growth,  and  oxidation  to  ensure  the  overall  mass  balance.
Methods of the first type are schematically shown in Fig.  16.  It is
evident that the gas-phase (left box) and particle-phase (right box) are
solved separately, though the two phases are coupled through incep-
tion (commonly modeled as collision of PAHs) and surface reactions
(HACA and PAH adsorption for surface growth and soot oxidation by
OH and O2). Most macroscopic numerical studies of soot formation
in laminar flames have been performed using this type of approach
to model soot particle dynamics. On the other hand, the other type
does not solve the PBE explicitly; instead, it incorporates the aerosol
discrete sectional equations into the gas-phase reaction mechanism and
express the rates of all the aerosol processes, such as soot inception,
surface growth, and coagulation, in the same Arrhenius equation as
elementary gas-phase reactions. This latter type of approach, called the
sectional soot kinetics model (SSKM) below, was proposed by Howard
and co-workers [69,268] and later further developed and applied by
the CRECK modeling group [211,269], D’Anna and co-workers [72,
73,270],  and  Gerlinger  and  co-workers  [248,271–273].  The  second
type approach for incorporating particle dynamics into soot formation
modeling is schematically illustrated in Fig.  17, which corresponds to
the study of Saggese et al. [211] and should be treated as a specific
implementation of the SSKM. Heavier PAHs and soot particles beyond
the gaseous species resolved in the gas-phase reaction mechanisms are
discretized into a number of bins in terms of either molar mass or the
number of carbon atoms. Each bin can be considered pseudo species
that are representative of a number of species whose carbon numbers
fall in a relatively narrow range. To account for soot surface growth
via C2H2 addition to radical sites through the HACA mechanism, each
bin contains both a pseudo stable species and its radical counterpart
as a result of hydrogen abstraction. In the example shown in Fig.  17,
heavy PAHs and soot particles are discretized into 20 bins in terms of
the number of carbon atoms (Nc ). PAHs with carbon numbers between
20  and  40  are  lumped  into  BIN1  and  each  next  larger  BIN  covers
about twice the carbon numbers. BIN1 to BIN4 represent lumped PAHs
and their radicals (PAHs∗). BIN5 to BIN12 represent spherical particles
with volume-equivalent diameters (D) from 2.04 up to 10.14 nm. For
larger particles beyond BIN12, they are considered as agglomerates of
spherical particles with a diameter of 10.14 nm, i.e., spherical particles
in BIN12, and the number of primary particles Np in each bin is also
shown at the bottom row of Fig.  17. The main difference between the
SSKMs and the first type of method is that the SSKMs do not solve the
PBE explicitly and treat the particle-phase as pseudo species. Further
details of SSKM will be discussed in Section 4.3. A discussion on the
advantages and disadvantages of the PBE-based methods (the first type)
and SSKMs will be given in Section 4.4.

This section discusses the use of both types of macroscopic methods
to model soot particle dynamics, the typical solution methods of the
PBE  for  modeling  sooting  flames  using  methods  of  the  first  type,
advantages and disadvantages of the two types of method, and their
limitations as compared to detailed discrete element methods.

4.1. Population balance equation

The distribution of aerosol particle sizes is described by the number
density function (NDF). The NDF is defined as the expected number of
particles, η, presenting certain properties of interest (ζ, called internal
coordinates  and  constituting  the  phase-space)  inside  an  infinitesimal
) at time t.
control volume located at physical position x =
Here, it is assumed that the length scales of changes in the continuous
phase are much larger than the disperse phase (solid particles for the
case of soot). The PBE is a conservation statement that describes how
the NDF (η = η(x, t; ζ)) evolves in physical-space, time, and phase-space.
The general form of the PBE for soot particles can be written as [38,39]:

the thermophoretic effects, the diffusion of the NDF controlled by the
diffusion coefficient , and finally the source term  ̇Sζ (ζ). Eq. (35) is
written in Einstein’s notation, i.e., repeated indices mean summation.
The source term on the right-hand-side (RHS) of the equation com-
prises continuous and discontinuous changes on each of the internal
coordinates selected for the particle description:

(36)

In the context of soot modeling, P  accounts for discontinuous processes
such  as  inception,  aggregation  or  fragmentation,  whereas  Gζi   is  a
growth (or shrink) function representing the continuous rate of change
of particle size in each particular internal coordinate ζi. Note that on
a fundamental level, all processes are discontinuous, but they can be
treated as continuous if their length and time scales are much smaller
than the changes on the particle. For soot formation in flames, surface
growth via polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) adsorption and the
HACA  mechanism,  and  the  surface  shrinkage  via  oxidation  by  OH
radicals and O2 molecules can be treated as continuous processes.

The  description  of  the  NDF  can  be  accomplished  by  using  one
(univariate), two (bivariate), or multiple (multivariate) internal coor-
dinates,  depending  on  the  level  of  detail  desired  for  the  aggregate
description and computational time restrictions. The univariate formu-
lations use the mass or volume-equivalent diameter of the aggregate as
the sole internal coordinate, which effectively considers soot aggregates
as spherical particles. The simplest univariate formulation is to treat
soot aggregates as locally monodisperse spherical particles as done in
empirical two-equation soot models, such as in  [274]. The univariate
formulation allows access to the overall mean properties of the NDF,
but provides no further details about the morphology of soot aggregates
beyond  the  volume-equivalent  diameter.  To  take  into  account  the
fractal-like structure of soot particles, at least two independent internal
coordinates  are  required  to  predict  the  mean  diameter  of  primary
particles and the number of primary particles per aggregate. Different
options for the two independent internal coordinates have been used:
aggregate volume and surface area [45,275,276], aggregate volume
and the number of primary particle [46,277], the number densities of
aggregate and primary particle in each soot section [42,43,67].

4.2. Solution methods of PBE

The main issue for finding the solution of the PBE lies in the closure
of the source terms  ̇Sζ (ζ). These terms account for particle–particle
or  particle-gas  interactions  in  continuous  or  discontinuous  fashion.
Either way, they have to consider all the possible sizes of the particle
population for each internal coordinate, resulting in infinite integrals
(unclosed terms) that have to be evaluated. This has prompted the
development of different methods to attain the source terms’ closure
and obtain an approximate solution of the PBE. Stochastic methods,

such as the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) algorithm [278–
281], are the most accurate methods to reproduce the NDF. These
kinds of method simulate each underlying soot event explicitly, with
a probability of occurrence based on the rate of each soot process.
However, these methods are extremely computationally expensive and,
thus, suited only for 0D or 1D configurations of reactive systems, or in
an uncoupled fashion with the flow field. Therefore, the two alternative
methods that are less computationally expensive, namely the sectional
methods and moment-based methods, have been extensively used for
modeling particle dynamics in complex configurations. Fig.  18 shows a
schematic of different selected PBE methods, discussed below, and their
capabilities to reproduce the PSD of a bimodal distribution, characteris-
tic of sooting zones where both inception and aggregation are present.
Monte Carlo methods are able to reproduce accurately the actual PSD.
With  an  adequate  resolution  of  particle  size,  the  sectional  method
can well capture the actual PSD, though numerical diffusion can be
a  concern  [282,283].  The  method  of  moments  (MOM)  can  predict
the mean particle size and the deviation with reasonable accuracy;
however, it in general cannot predict the PSD unless the functional
form of PSD were prescribed. The hybrid MOM, which was proposed by
Mueller et al. [63], is able to capture the mean particle size for both the
first mode (inception mode) and the second mode (aggregation mode).
Boje and Kraft presented an overview of PBE solution methods in their
recent review [99].

4.2.1. Sectional methods

Sectional methods are macroscopic models that discretize the con-
tinuous particle size or mass space into a series of sections or bins, in
which each section represents a relatively narrow range of particle sizes
or masses. To effectively capture the entire size distribution of soot
particles, these sections should be sufficiently fine and span a broad size
range covering from the smallest to the largest particles in the system

of interest. The design of the section spacing and span can leverage
prior information about the PSD. This discretization transforms the
particle size distribution into a set of transport equations for the particle
number densities within each section, enabling an explicit and detailed
tracking of PSD evolution. In soot modeling, two main approaches have
been developed within the framework of sectional methods. The first
treats soot particles separately from the gas phase, explicitly solving
the population balance equation, a strategy widely used in the aerosol
community. The second represents soot particles as pseudo-gas species
with properties linked to their size and mass, integrating them into the
kinetic mechanism governing flame chemistry. The following discus-
sion focuses on the first approach, which directly solves the PBE, while
details of the second approach, namely the sectional soot kinetic model
(SSKM), will be discussed in Section 4.3.

The literature contains numerous studies and variations of sectional
methods. In this review, we highlight only a selection of studies rele-
vant to our focus, without attempting a comprehensive overview. For
a more exhaustive review, readers are referred to [99]. In the context
of explicitly solving the PBE, different variations of sectional methods
have been developed based on whether the sections are fixed or mov-
ing, as well as on the number and type of internal coordinates used
to describe the number density function (NDF). These developments
have  been  greatly  driven  by  the  aerosol  scientific  community,  and
adopted to some extent by the combustion community. For example,
Gelbard and Seinfeld [284] developed a univariate sectional method
that  accounted  for  coagulation,  intraparticle  reactions,  inception  of
solid particles from the gas phase, and particle growth and shrinkage,
with the objective of capturing the evolving size distribution, as well
as the variation of chemical composition with particle size. Building
on  this,  Xiong  and  Pratsinis  [285]  introduced  a  bivariate  sectional
method that accounted for simultaneous changes in particle volume
and surface area, considering coagulation and sintering processes, im-
plemented  for  gas  phase  powder  production.  Colket  and  Hall  [65]

also employed a fixed-sectional approach to model laminar premixed
flames, accounting for inception, surface growth, and particle coales-
cence. Smooke et al. [66] extended these methods to laminar coflow
diffusion flames. Nakaso et al. [286] further refined these methods to
provide a more accurate representation of the smallest particles, finding
qualitative agreement with experiments performed on titania particles.
Although these formulations improved the fidelity of soot predictions,
the computational demand grew substantially with the complexity of
the description. To mitigate the computational cost, modified sectional
methods were developed. For example, assuming a uniform particle
size within each section reduces the number of integrals needed to
evaluate coagulation and adsorption kernels, thereby decreasing com-
putational expense [67,287,288]. Different internal coordinates have
also  been  employed  for  the  particle  description:  both  volume-  and
surface-based sectional methods have been studied [275,276], and Park
and Rogak [277] introduced a method that uses the number of primary
particles as an internal variable to explicitly consider surface growth
through the deposition of small clusters. They subsequently developed
a bivariate fixed-sectional method using both aggregate number density
and primary particle number density as internal coordinates, enabling
a fractal representation of soot aggregates [67], and developed sub-
routines [47] that can be easily employed in kinetic packages such as
Chemkin. This approach supported the development of the CoFlame
code [42,43], a numerical tool that has been used in various studies
for soot modeling in laminar coflow flames. Implementations in this
code discretize the PSD into NS fixed mass sections and solve conser-
vation equations for both aggregate number density (np) and primary
particle number density (npp), capturing soot inception, surface growth,
oxidation, and aggregation-induced redistribution of particles between
sections. Subsequent improvements by Dworkin et al. [254], Veshkini
et al. [242], and Saffaripour et al. [289,290] have enhanced predictions
of soot volume fraction and particle size distributions in diverse flame
configurations. Notably, adding comprehensive PAH growth pathways,
thermal aging mechanisms, and reversible PAH adsorption models have
further strengthened the predictive capabilities across both premixed
and diffusion flames [242,266]. More recently, Kholghy et al. [189] en-
hanced this sectional method by incorporating the tracking of hydrogen
atoms within each section alongside the number densities of primary
particles and aggregates. This advancement enabled the calculation of
a hydrogen-to-carbon (H/C) ratio for each section, providing a basis to
quantify the degree of maturity of soot particles.

It  is  worth  noting  that,  despite  the  computational  cost  of  this
method, it has been successfully applied even in turbulent flame condi-
tions. For instance, Rodrigues et al. [48] utilized a soot sectional model
in large-eddy simulations of turbulent non-premixed flames. Similarly,

Sun and Rigopoulos [291] applied a sectional approach to turbulent
flames, focusing on accurate moment conservation in the discretization
of aggregation while employing the same gas-phase chemistry, soot ki-
netics, and aerosol dynamics models previously used for laminar coflow
flames [196]. For a more comprehensive review of soot dynamics in
turbulent flows, readers are directed to the work of Rigopoulos [64].

One of the problems of the fixed-sectional method, as mentioned
before,  is  that  it  suffers  from  numerical  instability  and  numerical
diffusion,  arising  from  the  continuous  surface  growth  term  (second
term at the left-hand-side of Eq. (35)) of the population balance equa-
tion  [68].  Different  efforts  have  been  made  to  diminish  this  effect
and improve the accuracy on the PSD predictions. One straightforward
manner to avoid these problems is using a moving sectional method,
where the representative sizes of the sections change depending on
the surface growth rate [282]. However, this method is difficult to
apply to spatially inhomogeneous systems. Another way to diminish
numerical diffusion is through high resolution schemes, such as the one
proposed by Qamar et al. [292], which is capable to resolve sharp peaks
and shock discontinuities, or using coupling the fixed-sectional with
stochastic methods [293]. More recently, efforts by Rigopoulos and col-
leagues have focused on reducing numerical diffusion in fixed-sectional
methods  through  more  sophisticated  numerical  techniques  such  as
adaptative grid approaches [294] or using a composite grid [295].

To address the computational challenge of sectional methods, meth-
ods of moments have been developed and employed as an alternative
approach to model sooting flames. By reducing the complexity of the
problem to the calculation of a small set of moments, these methods can
significantly reduce the computational cost, making them more suitable
for  modeling  multidimensional  sooting  flames  and  for  multivariate
formulations. Alternatively, monodisperse population balance models
(MPBMs) can be used to simulate particle dynamics minimizing the
computational cost [296]. For example, a three-equation MPBM for
the total number, area, and volume concentration was developed to
describe the evolution of soot volume fraction, number concentration,
mean mobility, and primary particle diameters during surface growth,
oxidation,  and  coagulation  in  the  free-molecular  [243]  and  transi-
tion  [297]  regimes.  This  MPBM  was  interfaced  with  EDEM-derived
power-laws  [94]  to  account  for  the  evolving  soot  morphology  and
found good agreement with experimental data from premixed flames.
Nevertheless, the choice between sectional methods and methods of
moments  often  depends  on  the  specific  requirements  of  the  prob-
lem at hand, including the level of detail needed and the available
computational resources.

4.2.2. Methods of moments

Methods of moments (MOM) solve transport equations only for a
set of few selected moments of the NDF. Usually, these are lower-order
moments that represent physical properties of interest. For example,
choosing the volume V  and surface S as internal coordinates (ζ =
(V , S)) to describe the soot particle morphology, the bivariate moment
mkl of the NDF is defined as [45]:

∞

∞

mkl = ∫
0

∫

η(x, t; V , S)V kSldV dS.

(37)

With this definition, the PBE can be transformed into transport equa-
tions for the selected set of moments as:

where ̃ui = ui − VT ,i. The RHS of Eq. (38) is the transformed source term
̃̇Sζ (ζ), which has to be closed. Based on the closure strategy, different
MOMs have been developed.

Frenklach pioneered the development of moment-based methods
applied  to  soot  modeling,  introducing  governing  equations  for  the
moments  of  a  discrete  soot  particle  size  distribution  in  [53].  Fren-
klach and Harris [54] later implemented these equations numerically,
demonstrating  the  approach  for  pure  coagulation  as  well  as  cases
involving simultaneous nucleation, coagulation, and surface growth.
They employed a polynomial interpolation closure known as MOMIC
(Method of Moments with Interpolative Closure), which approximates
unknown moments from tracked ones using logarithmic polynomial
interpolation. Although MOMIC is efficient, its estimates for unsolved
moments, especially those requiring extrapolation, can be inaccurate.
An extensive discussion of this method and its application to model
soot particle dynamics has been given by Wick et al. [298]. Subsequent
work expanded the applicability of MOMIC-based methods. These ap-
proaches were used to model soot formation in premixed flames of
various fuels [55], at both low [56] and high pressures [57,58], and
even captured transitions from coalescent to aggregation growth in
laminar premixed flames [59]. Beyond polynomial closures, new strate-
gies emerged to improve accuracy and flexibility of these methods.
The Quadrature Method of Moments (QMOM) [60] approximated the
source terms by representing the NDF with a set of quadrature nodes
and weights, yielding high accuracy for univariate NDFs. However,
QMOM proved difficult to extend to multivariate NDFs. Variations such
as brute-force QMOM [299], tensor-product QMOM [300–303], and
conditional QMOM (CQMOM) [304] partially addressed multivariate
challenges, though often with reduced accuracy. The extended QMOM
(EQMOM) [305] introduced non-negative weight functions to allow
more nodes without increasing the number of tracked moments, and
the Direct Quadrature Method of Moments (DQMOM) [62,306] solved
transport equations directly for quadrature weights and abscissas, fa-
cilitating straightforward multivariate applications. Zucca et al. [307]
then coupled the DQMOM approach in its monovariate form to model
soot formation in turbulent flames.

In  parallel,  simplified  moment-based  formulations  also  emerged.
Assuming spherical, locally monodisperse particles and using mass as
the only internal coordinate, Leung et al. [274] developed the classic
two-equation model. This model, widely used in complex combustion
simulations, has been frequently applied in literature as a simple yet
effective tool for soot predictions. Mueller et al. [45] extended MOMIC
to a bivariate formulation using volume and surface area as internal
coordinates, and Blanquart et al. [308] further refined the approach
to track hydrogen content alongside volume and surface. Linking the
hydrogen-to-carbon ratio to soot absorption and maturity enabled a
more detailed description of soot particles without increasing signif-
icantly  the  computational  cost.  To  enhance  the  ability  of  moment
methods  to  capture  the  distinctive  behavior  of  small  incipient  soot
particles, Mueller et al. [63] also combined MOMIC and DQMOM into
the Hybrid Method of Moments (HMOM). HMOM introduces a delta
function fixed at the smallest particle size, explicitly accounting for

25

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 110 (2025) 101234

incipient particles and improving predictions of bimodal particle size
distributions.

As knowledge of soot morphology advanced, it became evident that
fractal-like aggregate structures cannot be fully captured by univari-
ate moment methods alone. At least a quasi-bivariate formulation is
required to represent the polydispersity and fractal nature of soot ag-
gregates composed of locally monodisperse primary particles. Various
combinations of internal coordinates have been proposed, including
particle volume and surface area [45], total particle mass and primary
particle  number  [58],  and  particle  volume  combined  with  primary
particle  number  [46].  Incorporating  fractal-like  morphology  signifi-
cantly  improves  predictions,  as  demonstrated  by  Xing  et  al.  [46],
who  found  that  bivariate  moment  methods  yielded  peak  soot  vol-
ume fractions nearly twice those predicted by univariate models in
laminar coflow methane/ethanol diffusion flames at 2, 4, and 6 atm.
This improvement comes from a more realistic representation of soot
surface  area  and,  consequently,  its  growth  and  oxidation  behavior.
Similar findings had also been made in earlier studies, e.g. by Morgan
et al. [78]. Salenbauch et al. [50] introduced an EQMOM variant based
on  superimposed  kernel  density  functions,  splitting  the  entire  NDF
into sub-NDFs that collectively approximated a gamma distribution.
This approach matched the accuracy of Monte Carlo simulations in
fuel-rich premixed flames and could also predict particle oxidation.
Ferraro et al. [51] subsequently applied this method, combined with
LES/presumed probability density function flamelet/progress variable
approaches, to model soot PSD in a turbulent Delft Adelaide Flame.
Similarly, Wu et al. [52] developed a joint moment projection and
maximum entropy reconstruction method to accurately reproduce soot
PSDs, successfully simulating soot formation and oxidation in diesel
engines and capturing the bimodal distribution arising from concurrent
inception and surface growth.

For more detailed overviews of these methods, readers are referred

to the reviews by Rigopoulos [64] and Boje and Kraft [99].

4.2.3. Hybrid approaches

In an attempt to benefit from the advantages of sectional meth-
ods  and  MOM  while  overcome  their  disadvantages,  various  hybrid
approaches have been developed. Bruns and Ezekoye [309] presented
a hybrid sectional quadrature-based moment method. In their model,
they discretize the NDF across multiple bins, representing the NDF
within each bin using a limited set of Delta functions. They observed
that the model delivered superior performance when leveraging coarser
sections and a high-order quadrature within each section. Similarly,
Laurent et al. [310,311] developed a two-size moment method, which
uses  a  continuous  function  within  each  section  to  reconstruct  the
NDF and evaluate the particle fluxes between neighboring sections.
Recently, Yang and Mueller [312] developed a multi-moment sectional
method  (MMSM)  using  polynomial  or  exponential  functions  within
each section to reconstruct the NDF. Their findings revealed that the
MMSM significantly improved the rate of convergence, showing an im-
provement factor of two when compared to the conventional sectional
method. Then, Maldonado and Mueller [313] used this method in a
volume-surface formulation coupled to a LES framework to simulate
laboratory-scale turbulent non-premixed jet flame. Other approaches
combining Monte Carlo and the sectional method have also been pro-
posed, such as the hybrid stochastic/fixed-sectional method [293]. This
method combines a fixed number of stochastic particles and discrete
fixed-sections  to  manage  agglomeration  and  inception  source  terms
effectively.

4.2.4. Application to agglomeration with surface growth

To simulate particle agglomeration with surface growth in the case
study presented in Section 6, details of how methods of moments deal
with agglomeration and surface growth are given here. The DQMOM
was selected due to its more straightforward implementation for mul-
tivariate formulations [62]. For the test cases studied in Section 6,

F. Liu et al.

a simplified PBE is dealt with since advection, thermophoresis, and
diffusion are absent. The source term for surface growth is considered
a continuous process, whereas agglomeration is considered a discon-
tinuous one (see Eq. (36)). The DQMOM is formulated in terms of
the internal coordinates volume V  and surface S of the soot particle.
Therefore, growth functions GV  and GS describing the temporal rate
of change for particle volume and surface due to surface growth are
required. The specified mass growth rate  ̇ω in kg/m3/s is assumed to
be deposited on the soot surface homogeneously, so we define a surface
mass flux as φm = ̇ω∕stot, where stot is the total specific surface of the
aggregate in m2/m3. In a time step Δt, the mass of an aggregate will
increase as:

Δm = ΔV ρp = SφmΔt ⇒

∂V
∂t

≡ GV =

(39)

Considering  that  in  the  context  of  the  DQMOM,  primary  particles
are assumed to be spherical and in point-contact, the surface growth
function can be obtained using the chain rule as:

To model the aggregation process, a collision kernel (denoted by β)
is required. At this point, a fractal dimension and prefactor have to be
selected to evaluate the collision kernel. Having the collision kernel for
aggregation, and growth functions for surface growth, closure of the
source terms in the context of DQMOM is direct [62,63,303]. These
terms  for  the  moment  kl  for  surface  growth  ( ̇Ssg
kl )  and  aggregation
( ̇Sagg

where Nδ is the number of delta functions used for the quadrature

selecting Nδ and a set of 3Nδ moments is sufficient to evaluate the
source terms.

4.3. Sectional soot kinetics models

As shown in Fig.  17, the sectional soot kinetics models (SSKMs)
are inherently a sectional approach to incorporate the soot particle
dynamics into an extended reaction mechanism, in which heavier PAHs
(beyond  those  included  in  the  base  gas-phase  reaction  mechanism)
and  soot  particles  are  considered  as  pseudo  chemical  species.  The
framework of SSKM was proposed by Howard and co-workers [69,268]
and subsequently modified and improved by several groups [72,211,
270,271,273]. It is well-known that PAHs undergo dehydrogenation
in flames as they evolve from smaller aromatics with high H/C ratios
to pericondensed aromatics with low H/C ratios [21,69]. Soot also
undergoes dehydrogenation as they evolve from liquid-like particles
at inception to graphitic mature aggregates. It is interesting to notice
that dehydrogenation has been taken into account in all the SSKMs.
Three similar but somewhat different approaches have been used to
account for the dehydrogenation of PAH and soot particles. Richter
et  al.  [69]  assigned  a  single  H/C  ratio  to  each  bin  that  decreases
with  increasing  the  carbon  number  (or  the  bin  number).  A  similar
approach was used by Gerlinger and co-workers [271,273]. Saggese
et al. [211] considered three subclasses with different H/C ratios for
heavier PAHs and spherical soot particles (BIN1 to BIN12 in Fig.  17)
and two subclasses for fractal-like aggregates (BIN13 to BIN20 in Fig.
17).  This H/C ratio model has also been adopted in a very recent
study from the CRECK modeling group [314]. Finally, D’Anna and co-
workers [72,270] utilized five bins to track the H/C ratio over the range
of 0 to 1. Since radicals (either PAHs or BINs, denoted as PAH* and
BIN*; PAH here refers to PAH species resolved in the gas-phase reaction

26

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 110 (2025) 101234

mechanism), not their stable counterparts, are involved in reactions,
such as surface growth reactions with C2H2, each BIN consists of both a
stable lumped PAH or soot particle and its radical. All possible reactions
involving BIN* with PAH (BIN*-PAH), BIN* with PAH radicals (BIN*-
PAH*), and stable BINs with PAH radicals (BIN-PAH*) are included
in the extended reaction mechanism and modeled in the same way
as gas-phase reactions with details given later. In addition, reactions
between stable PAHs, between PAH and BIN, and between stable BINs
are also taken into account but modeled as a collision process. Similar
to PAHs, stable BINs are activated by hydrogen abstraction with H and
OH radicals [69,73] or with only H radicals [211,273,314].

It is important to point out that the H/C ratio in each bin is required
in SSKMs to correctly calculate the stoichiometric coefficients of the
pseudo reactions involving the pseudo species (bins) to ensure conser-
vation of elements, namely C, H, and O [69,202,211,271,273,314]. To
facilitate the discussion of SSKMs, the model of Saggese et al. [211] is
used as an example. The classification of BINs and the pseudo reactions
and rates are provided in Supporting Material (S3). The BINs defined in
this model is also shown in Fig.  17. In this model, the reaction between
two pyrene molecules is written as

C16H10 + C16H10 → C32H20 → 0.4BIN1 + 0.6BIN2
→ 0.1667BIN1,A + 0.2333BIN1,B
+ 0.25BIN2,A + 0.35BIN2,B

(43)

The stoichiometric coefficients of this reaction are derived first using
linear interpolation for the number of C atoms in C32H20 and those of
BIN1 (Nc = 20) and BIN2 (Nc = 40) and then for the number of H
atoms from the H/C ratios in the sub-BINs in BIN1 and BIN2 given in
Table S3.1.

In the SSKM of Saggese et al. [211], soot inception was modeled
as reactions among all the stable and radical lumped PAHs (BIN1 to
BIN4 in Table S3.2). In addition to HACA, soot surface growth was
also attributed to reactions (i) between stable and radical BINs with
resonantly stabilized radicals of hydrocarbon molecules (denoted as
RR*), such as C3H3 and C5H5, (ii) between stable and radical BINi with
PAH* for i ≥ 5, and (iii) between lumped PAHs (BINi and BIN*i, i ≤ 5)
and particle radical BINs (BIN*n, n ≥ 5). Oxidation of BINs by O and
OH radicals and O2 was taken into account. While O2 was assumed to
oxidize only radical BINs, O and OH can oxidize both stable and radical
BINs. Coagulation of particles was modeled as follows. While collisions
between  primary  particles  (BIN5  to  BIN12)  and  between  a  primary
particle and an aggregate (BIN13 and above) were assumed to result
in coalescence, collisions between two aggregates led to aggregation.
Of particular interest in the context of this review is how particle
dynamics is incorporated into the extended gas-phase reaction mecha-
nism in SSKMs. For reactions involving radicals (PAH* and BIN*), the
reaction rate was derived from that of a reference gas-phase reaction
and consideration of structural similarity [69,70,202,211]. For exam-
ple, the reaction given in Eq. (43) was taken as the reference gas-phase
reaction for soot inception due to reaction between two stable BINs
within the first four BINs. Its reaction rate (pre-exponential factor Aref
and activation energy Ea,ref ) is given in Table S3.2. The activation
energy of reactions between BINs is assumed the same as that of the
reference reaction. However, the pre-exponential factor is assumed to
vary in proportion to the collision frequency because of the increase in
collision diameter of lumped PAHs as

Cf

where the collision frequency is calculated from the gas kinetic theory

(45)

where μ is the reduced mass, σ is the collision diameter.  Saggese
et al. [211] modeled the soot aggregate collision diameter as

F. Liu et al.

Similar to other macro-scale methods, the fractal dimension Df  and
prefactor  kf   have  to  be  assumed.  It  is  noticed  that  the  latter  can
be estimated from an anti-correlation between Df  and kf  discussed
in Section 2.5. For surface growth by HACA, i.e., C2H2 + BIN*i →
products, the pre-exponential factor is assumed to be related to that
of the reference reaction given in Table S3.2 as

A
Aref

(47)

where D is the volume equivalent diameter of the BINi for i ≤ 12 or the
primary particle diameter for aggregates (i ≥ 13), which are formed
by spherical particles in BIN12 with Dp = 10.14 nm in the SSKM of
Saggese et al. [211], dref = 1.91 nm. The parameter χ is either 1 for
non-aggregate bins (i ≤ 12) or the number of primary particles, Np,
for aggregate bins. For surface growth through addition of RR*, PAH*,
and lumped PAH (BINi and BIN*i, i ≤ 4), the reference kinetic param-
eters are modified by a size dependent sticking probability (collision
efficiency) ηs as

k = Aref × T 0.5 × ηs = Aref × T 0.5 ×

100 + σ6.5
105 + σ6.5

(48)

where the collision diameter σ is in nm. Coalescence and aggregation
have no energy barrier and the rate constants are determined in a
similar manner to that of PAH adsorption to soot surface, i.e., the pre-
exponential factor is multiplied by a size dependent sticking probability
given as

ηs =

100 + σ8.5
105 + σ8.5

(49)

It is noticed that this sticking probability for coalescence and aggrega-
tion is higher than that for surface growth given in Eq. (48). However,
Saggese et al. [211] did not provide a justification for this choice.

It is somewhat surprising to notice that the rates of coalescence,
aggregation,  and  PAH  adsorption  on  soot  surface  in  the  SSKM  of
Saggese  et  al.  [211]  do  not  depend  explicitly  on  the  collision  fre-
quency. In other SSKMs, such as Huo et al. [202] and Eigentler and
Gerlinger [273], the rate constants of collision-driven processes, namely
inception, coalescence, aggregation, and PAH adsorption, are expressed
explicitly in terms of the collision frequency. In a recent study, Nobili
et al. [314] modified the coalescence and aggregation rate constants
by multiplying the volume ratio of the two colliding entities and the
number of carbon atoms, respectively. Overall, the rate constants in
the SSKMs described by Blacha et al. [271] and Gerlinger [273] are
formulated more explicitly in terms of particle related quantities, such
as the collision frequency, soot surface area, primary particle diameter.
Despite various differences in the division of bins, kinetic constants
of pseudo reactions, and the sticking probability model among avail-
able SSKMs, these models provide an alternative to solving the PBE
explicitly in modeling soot formation in flames.

4.4. Discussions of the two types of macro-scale method

Approaches of the first type for macro-scale modeling of soot for-
mation incorporate explicitly soot kinetics into the PBE mainly using
the methods of moments or sectional methods. They generally offer a
more detailed representation of soot particle dynamics, especially when
the PBE is solved using a discrete sectional method. Since the PBE
describing the particle-phase processes is solved separately from the
gas-phase chemistry frequently through operator splitting, even though
the two phases are coupled as shown in Fig.  16, PBE-based methods
offer great flexibility to solve the gas-phase governing equations and the
PBE using different solvers and at different levels of accuracy when the
simulation time is of a concern. Correspondingly, PBE-based methods
can be more modular. The flexibility of using different solvers for the
gas-phase and particle-phase allows researchers to develop advanced
soot kinetic models (inception, surface growth, and oxidation) or better
PBE solvers with minimum amount of work to implement the new

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 110 (2025) 101234

model or solver into the existing code. On the other hand, solving
the  PBE  using  a  different  methodology  from  that  of  the  gas-phase
requires a careful model formulation to handle the coupling of the two
phases to ensure the overall mass, element, and energy conservation.
Implementing these methods often involves intricate code development
and careful integration with existing solvers, and the computational
costs can become significant if a high level of resolution in the particle
size distribution is required. In addition, significant efforts are needed
to  add  more  advanced  capabilities  to  PBE-based  soot  models,  such
as  to  predict  H/C  ratio  in  MOM  [315]  and  the  discrete  sectional
method [189].

In contrast, SSKMs, in which heavy PAHs and soot particles are rep-
resented as pseudo-gas species and integrated directly into the chemical
mechanism, naturally achieve the coupling of soot kinetics, particle
dynamics, and gas-phase reactions. By embedding soot-related physical
and  chemical  processes  directly  into  the  standard  chemical  solver,
the complexity of data exchange is reduced since both soot and gas
species are treated together within the chemical mechanism, potentially
simplifying the implementation and maintenance of the overall model.
In fact, if the chemical mechanism contains these pseudo-species, it
is straightforward to use it in codes developed for simulation of non-
sooting flames without explicit particle dynamic solvers. In addition to
tracking the H/C ratio with ease, it is also straightforward to incorpo-
rate more detailed soot inception and PAH and soot growth models, as
well as dehydrogenation models of PAH and soot particle in SSKMs by
adding appropriate pseudo reactions for these processes in the reaction
mechanism [73,211]. It is noticed that adding more reactions to a SSKM
only slightly increases the simulation time, which increases strongly
with the number of pseudo species or bins. On the other hand, this
approach can introduce substantially additional numerical stiffness into
the system of equations, as it must simultaneously resolve the highly
nonlinear  and  often  stiff  gas-phase  kinetics  along  with  the  pseudo-
species representing particle-related reactions and dynamics. The SSKM
of Sirignano et al. [270] consists of 125 lumped stable species and
125 radicals, meaning that additionally 250 species transport equations
must be solved simultaneously with those for gaseous species. Although
the SSKM of Saggese et al. [211] employed a smaller number of pseudo
lumped species of 100, it is still substantial. For these reasons, SSKMs
have often been applied to 1D premixed and counterflow diffusion
flames, especially when the primary particles are allowed to vary in
the recent development of the SSKM [314]. This extended capability
was achieved at the cost of a very large increase in the computational
time as a result of using 465 lumped pseudo species.

In  addition  to  being  lack  of  flexibility  and  having  to  deal  with
a  very  large  reaction  mechanism,  SSKMs  suffer  additional  difficul-
ties. First, the rate constants of reactions involving lumped PAHs and
particles are estimated based on some empirically chosen reference
gas-phase reactions based on structural similarity and some scaling
relationships. Secondly, the thermochemical properties of the pseudo
species, such as specific heat and enthalpy, are also estimated. Thirdly,
SSKMs have commonly made some highly simplified assumptions of
soot particle morphology. For examples, soot particles were assumed
spherical in [69,202,270,271] or spherical for small particles and ag-
glomerates formed by monodisperse primary particles of a prescribed
diameter  for  larger  particles    [211].  A  slightly  more  realistic  soot
particle morphology model was used by Eigentler and Gerlinger [273].
They assumed soot particles are spherical when their diameters are
below 14 nm. Above this value, primary particles undergo aggregation
and the primary particle diameters and the number of primary particles
in two adjacent aggregate BINs satisfy

Dp,i = (2∕χcoag)1∕3Dp,i−1

Np,i = χcoagNp,i−1

(50)

(51)

where χcoag is an adjustable parameter to describe coalescence (χcoag =
1), agglomeration (χcoag = 2), or anywhere between the two limits (1

27

F. Liu et al.

< χcoag < 2). It is noticed that the particle volume in BINi is twice that
in BINi−1, consistent with the classification of BINs [273]. To overcome
the limitation of the SSKM of Saggese et al. [211], Nobili et al. [314]
recently proposed an improved SSKM in which each aggregate BIN is
further classified into sub-bins of different primary particle diameters
under the condition that the particle mass is kept constant. As men-
tioned earlier, this improved capability of predicting primary particle
size is gained at the expense of significant increase in the computing
time due to the use of 465 bins compared to 100 bins used by Saggese
et al.

In  summary,  macroscopic  modeling  of  soot  formation  using  the
first type of methods solves the PBE explicitly for the particle number
density function or its moments, while the soot kinetics provide the
various source terms describing soot inception, surface growth, and
oxidation. In contrast, the second type of methods, namely SSKMs, treat
heavy PAHs and soot particles as pseudo chemical species and solve
their species transport equations together with those of gaseous species.
While the former methods emphasize the particle nature of soot, the
latter models treat soot as lumped species. This explains why the former
methods can better resolve particle dynamics, particle size distribution,
and mean primary particle size and the latter offers a convenient way to
incorporate more detailed soot chemistry for inception, surface growth,
dehydrogenation, and oxidation.

4.5. Limitations of macroscopic methods

The PBE-based macroscopic methods for modeling particle dynam-
ics of fractal soot aggregates in sooting flames discussed above, using
either MOMs or sectional methods, have commonly been developed as
a quasi-bivariate model assuming polydisperse aggregates formed by
locally monodisperse primary particles in point-contact. This practice
aims to maintain a compromise between computational efficiency and
capabilities since these methods are often used in coupled calculations
with flow, gas-phase chemistry, and detailed soot kinetics. As a con-
sequence, such PBE-based macroscopic methods are unable to resolve
any details, such as primary particle size distribution, degree of primary
particle overlap, and fractal parameters of soot particles beyond the
distribution of aggregate size and mean primary particle size in the
case of sectional methods, or quantities of interest related to low-order
moments in the case of MOMs. On the contrary, these macroscopic
methods rely on assumed soot aggregate fractal parameters to evaluate
their collision frequency. Even with these limitations, it is preferred to
use a quasi-bivariate particle morphology model over the sphere model
to more accurately estimate the particle surface area. These limitations
also exist in the SSKMs. In fact, it is even more difficult and more
computationally expensive for a SSKM to predict the mean primary
particle diameter.

4.6. Summary of macroscopic approaches

The macroscopic approaches discussed in this review have been
implemented in a variety of computational frameworks designed for
modeling reactive flows, with different capabilities and levels of com-
plexity for soot predictions. These codes range from specialized solvers
focused on fundamental flame studies to large-scale simulation environ-
ments suited for practical engineering applications. Their soot modeling
strategies differ in terms of numerical formulations, coupling between
gas-phase chemistry and particle dynamics, and the level of detail in
soot formation and growth/oxidation processes. Table  2 provides a
comparative summary of selected codes developed for soot formation
modeling in a range of applications, from 0D, 1D, and 2D laminar
flames  to  multi-dimensional  turbulent  engine  combustion,  with  the
features of soot formation modeling highlighted.

5. Meso-scale methods for modeling soot particle aggregation

Meso-scale methods track the dynamics of individual particles in the
simulation volume and are able to provide their detailed morphological
information. The reason for developing modeling capabilities of the
morphology of individual soot particles is to not only understand the
diversity  in  the  morphology  of  individual  soot  particles  during  the
evolution of soot maturity from the viewpoint of particle dynamics
but also to better quantify the population-based soot morphology. The
latter  is  required  by  macro-scale  modeling  using  MOM,  a  sectional
method, or any other macro-scale approaches. Such assumed values of
Df  and kf  are typically based on DLCA agglomerates or TEM image
analysis and subject to uncertainties, since it has been made clear that
soot morphology evolves during the formation process and can have
different Df  and kf  from those of DLCA and may vary with flame
conditions. In addition, our intention is to make the reader aware of the
importance of distinguishing the individual morphology of an aggre-
gate from that deduced statistically on a population (classical method).
Indeed, it has been recently shown that the two fractal dimensions
can differ, with the individual fractal dimension being lower than the
population dimension [129].

In this section, we will first introduce tunable algorithms, which are
a class of methods to numerically generate fractal agglomerates with
prescribed morphological parameters. Then the rest of this section is
dedicated to some fundamental aspects and details related to available
meso-scale methods for modeling particle agglomeration and aggrega-
tion. The focus is the three commonly used meso-scale approaches to
model soot particle agglomeration in the presence of inception, surface
growth, and oxidation, namely the event-driven DEM (EDEM), MCAC,
and DSPB. Although the DSPB model has recently been reviewed by
Boje  and  Kraft  [99],  it  is  useful  to  include  this  meso-scale  model
in the following discussion to better understand the similarities and
differences among the three meso-scale approaches.

5.1. Tunable algorithms

Tunable algorithms generate individual fractal aggregates consisting
of spherical primary particles by particle-cluster or cluster-cluster ag-
glomeration. In these types of methods, the morphology of the growing
agglomerate  is  constrained  to  respect  prescribed  fractal  dimension
and/or prefactor, rather than controlled by certain physical or chemical
mechanisms, as implied in their name. Therefore, tunable algorithms
are purely a tool to numerically generate agglomerates obeying cer-
tain  prescribed  properties.  Aiming  at  fixing  the  fractal  dimension,
Thouy and Jullien [324] introduced the first tunable cluster-cluster
agglomeration algorithm. Subsequently, several algorithms were devel-
oped [82,166,325–333]. Filippov et al. [82] introduced a method able
to preserve both the fractal dimension and the prefactor. This method
has  been  further  improved  for  efficient  generation  of  agglomerates
formed by point-touch monodisperse [89] and polydisperse  [89,90]
primary particles. Tunable algorithms are widely used to study soot
morphology [334,335] and particle-light interaction properties [336–
339], they are a versatile tool allowing to generate agglomerates of
different fractal dimensions that cannot be easily generated with DEM
approaches (e.g. Df > 2). Therefore, they are useful to generate fractal
agglomerates of different morphology for the purpose of studying the
effects of morphology on the physical and optical properties of fractal
agglomerates. However, they cannot, in principle, be used to study
the physics of soot formation or particle dynamics in flames because
they  do  not  take  into  account  the  physical  or  chemical  processes
involved.  It  should  be  emphasized  that  the  particle  morphology  is
imposed in these types of algorithms rather than naturally resulting
from the particle dynamics. Also, the selection of the pair of fractal
parameters (fractal dimension and prefactor) when varying one of these
parameters is uncertain. In this context, the anti-correlations between
fractal dimension and prefactor derived from DEM simulations can be

used (see Section 2.5). Recently, Tomchuk et al. [340] explored the
limits in fractal dimension and prefactor that can be generated with
tunable algorithms. Tunable algorithms have been recently reviewed
by Tomchuk [341]. To summarize,

• Tunable algorithms can generate aggregates with a fractal dimen-

sion commonly between 1.4 and 2.4.

• For a prescribed fractal dimension Df , the corresponding fractal
prefactor has to be chosen carefully. An anticorrelation between
fractal dimension and prefactor can be used for this purpose, see
Section 2.5.

• Cluster-cluster  approach  should  be  preferred  over  monomer-
cluster. The latter should be limited to generate aggregates con-
taining a relatively small number of monomers (< 20).

• Tunable algorithms are limited in terms of the physics of ag-
gregation as they do not explicitly simulate the trajectories of
particles controlled by the underlying physical processes and thus
they cannot account for effects of temperature, particle chemical
composition, surface reactions, and particle concentration on the
particle morphology.

5.2. An overview of meso-scale methods

In this review paper we consider the following definition of DEM
simulations: a discrete element method (DEM) is any of a family of
numerical methods for computing the motion of a population of par-
ticles explicitly (Lagrangian). In DEM simulations, the interactions and
contacts involving particles can be resolved individually. Unlike similar
methods of molecular dynamics, DEM particles are modeled as coarse-
grained objects consisting of a large number of atoms not simulated
explicitly. Fig.  19 shows the properties related to simulation system
and particles commonly found in DEM simulations. In the context of
soot simulations, DEM approaches falling on this definition include
velocity-resolved methods and Monte Carlo and DSPB models. Velocity-
resolved  methods,  including  Langevin  Dynamics,  event-driven  DEM
(EDEM), and MCAC, are briefly discussed below. Monte Carlo models
are explained in the next section.

5.2.1. Velocity-resolved methods

Velocity-resolved DEMs simulate detailed evolution of individual
particle position and velocity as a function of the residence time based

29

F. Liu et al.

on the conservation of momentum. Langevin dynamics [342] is one
of the most widely used velocity-resolved DEMs. In this method, the
dynamics of individual particles are simulated by solving the Langevin
equation [342]

m

d ⃗u
dt

= −f (⃗u − ⃗uf ) + ⃗FB +

∑ ⃗Fext,

(52)

which  is  a  linear,  first-order,  inhomogeneous  stochastic  differential
equation corresponding to the conservation of linear momentum for
an individual particle of mass m, velocity  ⃗u and acceleration d ⃗u∕dt.
The particle dynamics is determined by the external forces ∑ ⃗Fext and
the fluid-particle interaction forces, explained as follows. The particle-
gas  interaction  is  decomposed  into  two  distinctive  forces  namely  a
systematic or Stokes drag −f (⃗u − ⃗uf ) (⃗uf  is the surrounding fluid flow
velocity and f is the drag constant) and a stochastic force  ⃗FB resulting
from remaining random collisions between the suspended particle and
the gas molecules when the drag force is already considered. This force
is commonly modeled as Gaussian noise and considered uncorrelated in
time,

⟨FB(t)⟩ = 0,

(53a)

(53b)

⟨FB(t)FB(t′)⟩ = 6f kBT δ(t − t′),
where  the  brackets  ⟨... ⟩  indicate  ensemble  averages,  T   is  the  sur-
rounding gas temperature considered in thermal equilibrium with the
particle, t and t′ are two distinctive times, and δ(⋅) is the Dirac’s delta
function. The Langevin equation is able to predict the transition from
ballistic (t ≪ τ) to diffusive (t ≫ τ) motion of suspended particles.
In this context, it has been used to determine inter-particle collision
kernels in the transition regime of particle–particle interactions the-
oretically [218,343] or numerically without external forces [87,219,
220,223,224,226,231,234,235] and considering external forces [229,
230].  In  particular,  soot  aggregation  has  been  simulated  based  on
the Langevin equation in Refs. [188,344,345]. Computational imple-
mentations of the Langevin equation are commonly done based on
the  first-order  time  step  Ermak  and  Buckholz  method  [346].  How-
ever, there are many other methods including a fourth-order time step
Runge–Kutta [347] and the Verlet algorithm [344]. A detailed tutorial
about the computational implementation of the Langevin equation to
simulate suspended particles such as soot is provided by Suresh and
Gopalakrishnan [347].

Despite  the  robustness  of  Langevin  dynamics,  the  simulation  of
dilute  nanoparticle  systems  (such  as  those  typically  anticipated  in
laminar sooting flames) can be computationally expensive. And yet,
for most of the particles, the trajectory can be easily decomposed in
successions of broken lines corresponding to average free paths, at the
end of which orientations can be considered random. This drastic sim-
plification, while computationally convenient, ultimately corresponds
to what was done for the first DEM-type simulations developed in the
80s and 90s, called diffusion, ballistic or reaction-limited aggregation
codes [348]. It should be noted that, in these codes, the mean free path
was generally fixed arbitrarily. Although these codes became popular
for simulating aggregates with detailed morphology, they suffer from
certain limitations including difficulties mentioned as follows. For in-
stance, persistent distance or mean free path was generally aggregation
regime dependent, and the codes were unable to evaluate residence
times, and were not able to account for other phenomena, relevant to
soot formation, such as nucleation or surface reactions taking place in
addition to aggregation. This is why the EDEM, MCAC and DSPB codes,
which will be discussed in more detail below, were developed.

Event-driven, velocity-resolved methods, such as EDEM [93] can
offer  good  alternatives  to  standard  Langevin  dynamics  in  terms  of
improved computational time. Event-driven methods can describe the
ballistic motion and collision between two particles or agglomerates
assuming a hard sphere potential [349]. Based on the initial particle
position  and  velocity,  the  collision  time  between  two  hard  spheres

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 110 (2025) 101234

can  be  estimated  analytically  [349].  So,  unlike  Langevin  dynamics
that rely on explicit forward integration schemes with a time step,
in event-driven methods the time is propagated based on the smallest
time required for two particles or agglomerates to collide [349]. After
collision of two particles, the new velocity is estimated based on the
momentum  conservation  [349].  That  way,  the  ballistic  motion  and
coagulation of monodisperse [93] or polydisperse [350] nanoparticles
in  the  free  molecular  regime  is  derived  from  quasi  first  principles.
In addition, event-driven methods have been extended to account for
the diffusive motion of nanoparticles in the transition regime [93],
as well as for their growth by reactions with gaseous molecules [33].
More details regarding EDEMs used for soot formation, as well as their
thorough validation with theory and experimental data are provided in
the following sections.

MCAC is similar to EDEM in the sense of tracking individual parti-
cles but relies on different methods for estimating the particle persistent
distance and its corresponding time step, physical residence time and
taking into account the surface growth of primary particles. The particle
persistent distance was determined by discretizing the Langevin trajec-
tories of individual particles into segments respecting the application
of the random particle orientation rule after displacement [95]. The
corresponding time step is deduced by respecting the temporal diffu-
sive advance imposed by Eistein’s diffusion equation. This approach
ensures an accurate match between the particle trajectories predicted
by Langevin dynamics and those predicted by MCAC. A probability for
particle displacement is defined to respect a physical residence time
for  a  population  of  polydisperse  aggregates  and/or  monomers.  The
mobility diameter of the simulated aggregates, necessary to evaluate
their persistent distance, is based on an empirical law described previ-
ously (Section 2.3.2) and based on effective density measurements, and
taking the regime of primary particle-gas interaction into account [96]
and thus resulting in a different approach as compared to other models
in the literature. MCAC also allows surface growth to be taken into
account [34]. The effect of soot maturity has also been incorporated in
terms of particle composition which determines particle–particle van
der Waals interactions [206]. Finally, oxidation-induced fragmentation
has  been  implemented  in  MCAC,  enabling  it  to  be  coupled  with  a
macro-scale CFD code (CoFlame) to simulate the behavior of soot in
a laminar coflow diffusion flame [163].

5.2.2. Monte Carlo methods

Monte  Carlo  (MC)  methods  are  very  versatile  but  statistical  in
nature. For this reason, MC methods developed for modeling particle
dynamics are often termed stochastic particle methods. Frenklach and
co-workers developed a dynamic MC method to study soot particle
aggregation with simultaneous surface growth and inception in pre-
mixed sooting flames [31,32,158]. In this dynamic MC method, a single
particle to be studied, called the collector, is placed in the environment
consisting  of  spherical  incipient  soot  particles  and  gaseous  surface-
growth species. A primary particle, called the candidate, is then chosen
and translated towards the collector along a randomly selected ballistic
trajectory. Upon collision, the candidate and collector stick together
without  rearrangement.  The  collision  coefficient  βc  was  calculated
using the Fuch’s expression [201] with the gas properties evaluated
at the local flame temperature. The elapsed time of a single collision
(mean time between collisions) Δt is defined as

Δt = 1∕

(βc npp

)

(54)

where  npp  is  the  number  density  of  primary  particles.  During  the
elapsed time surface growth can take place at the collector particle sur-
face uniformly through the addition of the gaseous growth species [31,
59].

Kraft and co-workers developed a stochastic particle algorithm to
model the evolution of soot particle dynamics under concurrent par-
ticle inception, surface reactions, and coagulation [78,278] based on
the  direct  simulation  Monte  Carlo  (DSMC)  algorithm  developed  by

30

F. Liu et al.

Fig. 19.  The main internal degrees of freedom in DEM simulations related to the system and particle properties.

Gillespie [351]. Kraft and co-workers made various enhancements to
improve the computational efficiency of the stochastic particle model
over  the  DSMC  method,  such  as  the  use  of  majorant  kernels  and
fictitious jumps in the calculation of particle coagulation kernel [78,99]
and the linear process deferment algorithm [99,280]. Instead of solving
the PBE directly, the stochastic particle algorithm approximates the
solution of PBE by mimicking the physics of particle dynamics through
random generation of events, such as coagulation and surface growth,
with the probability of an event being related to its rate. The stochastic
particle algorithm, or detailed stochastic population balance (DSPB)
model, of Kraft and co-workers was implemented using the waiting
time or event-driven method. The DSPB model has been outlined and
improved in the last two decades in a series of publications, e.g. [78,
97,205,252,278], and reviewed recently by Boje and Kraft [99]. In
the DSPB model, soot particles are treated as fractal-like aggregates
formed by overlapping primary particles and each primary particle is
composed of a number of PAHs. The following six particle processes are
taken into account in the DSPB model: particle inception, coagulation,
surface growth, PAH adsorption (commonly termed condensation in the
literature), sintering, and coalescence [97,205].

The distinct advantage of the stochastic particle model is that it
permits a large number of internal variables of soot particles, including
but not limited to the size and relative position of primary particles as
well as the C/H ratio. As such, the detailed stochastic particle model
is capable of providing comprehensive information of soot particles,
such as fractal dimension, primary particle size distribution, degree of
overlap between neighboring primary particles, and even the particle
composition  [197,205,352,353],  namely  PAHs  in  the  case  of  soot,
which can be related to soot maturity. The disadvantage of stochastic
particle  models,  like  other  meso-scale  methods,  is  their  high  com-
putational cost. Consequently, meso-scale methods are typically used
as post-processing to obtain detailed morphological and composition
information of soot particles [163,205,353].

5.2.3. DEM simulation

In DEM, the dynamics of coarse-grained individual particles are
simulated explicitly. As shown in Fig.  19, these types of simulations
involve different degrees of freedom related to particle and system
properties to be explained as follows. In this context, a fairly large
number  of  spherical  primary  particles  (in  the  order  of  thousands)

31

F. Liu et al.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 110 (2025) 101234

are initially randomly placed in a domain box, avoiding overlapping
between neighbors, and assigned an initial velocity. Particles could be
initialized in overlapping positions but then an additional relaxation
or energy minimization step, such as the steepest descent method, is
needed along with repulsive interaction potentials to iteratively bring
the particles apart by fixing a maximum displacement and avoiding
numerical error due to infinitely large repulsion forces [354]. The latter
method may be needed for simulating systems with extremely high
volume fractions (fv > 10%) where algorithms to search free spaces
avoiding overlapping may become too slow or may simply not work.
As time evolves, the trajectories of individual particles are simulated
considering periodic boundary conditions. Without loss of generality,
let us consider a given axis x spanning the range x = [0, L], where
L is the length of the domain, a particle that exits the domain at the
position L will re-enter at the position x = 0 preserving its velocity.
The periodic boundary conditions intend to emulate the suspension
of particles into an infinitely large system and avoid any nonphysical
effect due to the finite size of the domain. In this context, the simulation
domain is commonly considered cubic which simplifies the treatment
of the periodic boundary conditions. As discussed by Allen and Tildes-
ley [355], in the context of similar Molecular Dynamics simulations, the
treatment of periodic boundary conditions in a spherical domain may
not be trivial. In addition, the size of the cubic domain L is commonly
determined based on a given volume fraction fv, and the total volume
of  particles  in  the  domain.  For  example,  if  a  total  of  N  spherical
particles, monodisperse in size with diameter Dp, are considered, then
L is given by Eq. (55a). On the other hand, when particles have a log-
normal size distribution with geometric standard deviation σp,geo and
geometric mean Dp,geo then L is given by Eq. (55b) [334],

L =

( N(π∕6)D3

5.2.4. Coarse-graining the morphology of aggregates in DEM

One  important  question  that  arises  in  the  context  of  DEM  sim-
ulations  of  nanoparticle  aggregates  is  how  to  coarse-graining  their
morphology, i.e., up to what level of detail we need to describe the
aggregates to simulate their dynamics and transport phenomena. As
shown  in  Fig.   20,  we  distinguish  two  models,  the  rigid-body  and
the so-called monomer-resolved models. In the rigid-body model, the
aggregate consists of point-touching primary particles, the dynamics of
the aggregates are described by a single velocity and position vectors,
and they are displaced as rigid or non-deformable bodies. In the so-
called  monomer-resolved  model,  the  movement  of  each  individual
primary particle belonging to the aggregate is simulated. In this model,
each primary particle belonging to the aggregate has an independent
velocity vector, and primary particles are held together by attractive
interaction potentials. As discussed by Inci et al. [356], without in-
cluding bonds limiting the sliding and rolling of monomers on the
surface of neighbors this model will result in compact and sphere-
like aggregates. The rigid-body model is commonly preferred in the
literature for the following reasons: (1) simplicity as it requires much
less number of interactions to be computed, it does not involve models
for inter-monomers interaction potentials, as well as sliding and rolling
criteria, (2) despite not being monomer-resolved, it can consider the
inter-aggregate aerodynamic interaction through a properly adapted
friction coefficient as discussed in Section 2.3, (3) computational effi-
ciency and stability. Of course, resolving the dynamics of each primary
particle belonging to an aggregate may be computationally expensive,
especially at long residence times where large soot aggregates may
be  formed.  In  addition,  the  monomer-resolved  model  may  become
numerically unstable in the limit of infinitely large aggregates due to
the propagation of stochastic forces within the aggregates.

Fig. 20.  Two models for coarse-graining the morphology of soot aggregates including
the rigid-body where the aggregate dynamics are described by a single velocity and
position vector and the aggregate is considered as a rigid body. The so-called monomer-
resolved model simulates the dynamics of each individual primary particle.

5.2.5. Particle–particle interaction potentials

Soot particle interaction forces  ⃗F  can be long-range (e.g., Coulomb)
and short-range (e.g., van der Waals). These forces can be alterna-
tively analyzed in terms of the potential energy W , which is related
to  ⃗F   as  ⃗F = − ⃗∇W ,  where  ⃗∇  is  the  gradient  operator.  The  short-
range interactions, notably van der Waals, may considerably enhance
coagulation. Harris and Kennedy [250] estimated that an enhancement
factor of about 2.2 leads to good agreement between simulated and
measured soot particle size distribution. Such coagulation enhancement
is especially important in the ballistically-limited, as compared to the
diffusion-limited, particle collisions [229].

In the context of DEM simulations, the short-range particle inter-
action potentials can be modeled considering a Lennard-Jones inter-
atomic potential w(r), where r is the center-center distance and w(r) is
the interaction energy between atoms,

w(r) = wrep(r) + wvdW(r) = 4ε

[( σ

)12

−

( σ

)6]

(56)

where parameters ε and σ correspond to the potential well and the
characteristic distance where the inter-atomic potential is null, respec-
tively. Both ε and σ are dependent on the type of atoms and thus
on the chemical composition of particles. This potential is composed
of two components, namely wrep(r) and wvdW(r) corresponding to the
repulsion due to the overlap of electron orbitals, and the van der Waals
attractions, respectively. However, all-atom calculations are too compu-
tationally expensive, and thus coarse-grained models must be employed
to determine these interaction potentials between macroscopic bodies.
As described in the following section, such coarse-graining can be done
at either the primary particle or the agglomerate level.

Primary particle coarse-grained potentials

Integrating Eq. (56) over the volume V1 and V2 of two spherical
particles having ρ atom number density and separated by a center-
center distance d leads to an attractive term WvdW(d) originally derived
by Hamaker [357], and an analogous repulsive term Wrep(d) proposed
by Inci et al. [356],

W (d) = Wrep(d) + WvdW(d)

We note that w(r) and W (d) are different interaction energies. While
the former corresponds to the interaction between a pair of atoms,
the latter is the coarse-grained or integrated interaction between two
macroscopic  objects  consisting  of  a  large  number  of  atoms.  These

with x = 0.5 (d − r1 − r2)∕r1 and y = r2∕r1, r1 and r2 are the primary
particle radii, and A is the Hamaker constant. Different experimental
works such as D’Alessio et al. [207] have highlighted the importance
of considering interaction potentials, notably, the Hamaker constant to
better understand soot size distribution in flames. A few studies have
considered this approach for DEM [231,345] and population balance
simulations [209] of soot formation under flame conditions.

Agglomerate coarse-grained potentials

Determining the inter-particle interactions at the primary particle
level may still be highly computationally expensive. In this context, an
alternative method has recently been proposed by Morán et al. [137],
where the vdW potential of fractal-like agglomerates with fractal di-
mensions Df 1 and Df 2 and volume-equivalent diameters Dv1 and Dv2
can be determined based on the following semi-analytical equation,

5.3. Implementations of EDEM, MCAC, and DSPB

In this section, some essential aspects related to the implementation
of the three commonly used meso-scale methods, i.e., EDEM, MCAC,
and DSPB, are reviewed in terms of how to handle the initial incipient
soot particles, particle motion and coagulation, and surface growth and
oxidation. Moreover, Table  3 provides a detailed comparison of all rel-
evant aspects affecting soot particle size and morphology implemented
in EDEM, MCAC, and the DSPB model in terms of physical properties
and models, some of which are discussed below.

5.3.1. Initial incipient soot particles
Event-driven DEM (EDEM)

In event-driven discrete element modeling, the particle dynamics
start with initially assumed incipient soot particles since soot inception
is  typically  not  coupled  with  DEM.  In  addition,  the  incipient  soot
particles are also regarded as soot primary particles in discrete ele-
ment modeling. In EDEM, 1000 spherical, monodisperse soot primary
particles having an initial diameter of Dp,o = 2–3 nm, are randomly

33

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 110 (2025) 101234

distributed in a cubic simulation cell [33]. Using 1000 particles in
EDEM  offers  a  good  balance  between  computational  efficiency  and
statistics. In particular, using more than 1000 particles does not alter
soot dynamics. On the other, reducing the number of initial particles
in the simulation box increases the statistical variability of the EDEM
simulations. During the evolution of the particle system, the tempera-
ture T  can be held constant [33] or varied with residence time to be
consistent with experimental measurements [163,361]. The pressure is
held constant over time but can be varied from 1 to 10 bar to simulate
soot  particle  aggregation  at  different  pressures  [360].  The  pressure
range used in EDEM is limited by the accuracy of the employed air
mean free path in such conditions. In this regard, robust relations for
the air mean free path derived by atomistic molecular dynamics at a
wide range of pressures and temperatures [362] can be used in EDEM
to improve its accuracy even beyond 10 bars. An initial soot diameter
of 2 - 3 nm is typically chosen here as it is the smallest size identified in
the inception peak of laminar premixed flames [155,363] and is a typ-
ical nucleus diameter used in soot modeling [364]. The initial number
concentration is set based on the highest ones measured in flames at a
height where inception has largely stopped [155]. The initial particle
velocity is sampled randomly from the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution
based on the set T . So, the mean thermal velocity (c) of each particle
is given by [365]:

√

c =

8kBT
πm

.

Monte Carlo aggregation code (MCAC)

(61)

Similar to the discrete element modeling described in the previ-
ous section, spherical primary particles having a critical coalescence
diameter are initially introduced into the simulation box. In this con-
text, primary particles are randomly placed in the simulation domain
avoiding overlapping with neighbors. As listed in Table  4, most meso-
scale simulations in the literature considered soot inception to have
stopped at the beginning of the simulation. One exception is the recent
study  of  Morán  et  al.  [163],  who  considered  a  time-evolving  soot
inception rate  ̇ωIncep obtained from macro-scale simulation of a laminar
coflow diffusion flame using a detailed soot model. In this approach of
accounting for soot inception, the number of monomers (Npp) to be
added into the simulation system is determined as,
dNpp
dt

(62)

=

̇ωIncep
mIncep

where mIncep is the mass of the incipient soot particles.

Detailed stochastic population balance method

The DSPB algorithm of Kraft and co-workers starts with the selection
of a predefined maximum number of particles to be simulated Nmax
in the simulation volume. The simulated particle ensemble represents
the real population of particles in the simulation volume. The size of
the initial simulation volume is determined according to the following
expression

Vsimu =

Nmax
np,max

(63)

where np,max is the maximum particle number density over the course
of simulation for the problem being studied [97]. Due to particle aggre-
gation, the number of particles in the simulation volume can decrease
over time. To maintain a statistically significant number of simulated
particles in the simulation volume, the particle ensemble is doubled
when N(t) < Nmax∕2 occurs. This is done by duplicating each particle
and doubling the size of simulation volume [97]. Although it is possible
to initiate the detailed stochastic population balance (DSPB) modeling
by introducing a large number of primary particles in the simulation
volume similar to MCAC and EDEM described above, DSPB modeling
has typically been coupled with a kinetic Monte-Carlo aromatic site
(KMC-ARS) model for growth of PAHs [247,370] and a PAH-based soot

was calculated from the in-

inception model [197,205,353]. Soot particles are treated as fractal-
like aggregates formed by overlapping spherical primary particles while
each primary particle is composed of several PAHs. The DSPB modeling
is initiated by adding gaseous PAH species, for example, pyrene (A4),
into the particle simulation volume according to its formation rate from
CFD modeling [205].

5.3.2. Particle motion and coagulation

Due to the low inertia of nanoparticles generated in flames, they
are sensitive to individual collisions with the surrounding gas. This
gas-particle interaction is commonly modeled as a Stokes drag and a
stochastic force uncorrelated in time and null on average. In the time-
scale t < τ, where τ is the particle momentum relaxation time defined as
τ = m∕f (ratio between the particle mass m and the friction coefficient
f ), the particles move approximately ballistically. In this time scale,
the particles move along a characteristic distance λp referred to as the
persistent or stopping distance. On the other hand, in the time-scale

t ≫ τ the particle movement becomes diffusive and can be described by
Einstein’s diffusion theory, i.e., the mean squared displacement is ⟨r2
⟩ =
6t, where  = kBT ∕f is the particle diffusion coefficient. In DEM,
this movement can be simulated using different stochastic methods
including (1) Event-driven DEM [93,94], (2) Monte Carlo [95,96,334],
and (3) Langevin Dynamics [87,188,224,344,345].

Collisions between single particles, aggregates and/or agglomerates
continuously reduce the number of particles in the simulation cell.
When the number of particles is halved, the cell volume is doubled con-
secutively in x-, y-, and z-directions [225] in both the EDEM and MCAC
approaches, similar to the DSPB method. This adjustment ensures that
the number of single particles, aggregates, and agglomerates always
remains between 500 and 1000. The purpose of volume-doubling is
to maintain statistically significant particle dynamics, which can be
validated against classic theories and population balance models. For
example, the EDEM-derived collision frequency of coalescing spheres
in  the  free  molecular,  transition,  and  continuum  regimes  has  been

37

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 110 (2025) 101234

validated  with  the  analytical  relation  derived  by  Fuchs  [93].  Simi-
larly, the EDEM-derived self-preserving size distributions in the free
molecular and continuum regimes have been validated against those
obtained from polydisperse population balance models [93]. Addition-
ally, the dynamics of soot total number concentration and mean Dm
during coagulation in the transition regime have been validated using
a monodisperse population balance model [297].

Event-driven DEM

Soot particle motion and coagulation from the free-molecular to the
transition regime are simulated using an event-driven method [93]. As
shown in Fig.  21(a), every soot primary particle follows ballistic trajec-
tories based on the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution of velocities [93].
A particle changes direction once it collides with another particle or
has traveled a distance equal to its mean free path, λp. The latter is
estimated by [365]

λp = τ ⋅ c

where τ is the particle relaxation time given by [365]

τ =

mCc(Dm)
3πηDm

(64)

(65)

where Cc is the Cunningham correction factor estimated based on the
mobility diameter Dm and η is the fluid viscosity.

Unlike standard methods for molecular and particle dynamics that
rely on explicit forward integration schemes with a finite time step,
in event-driven methods the time is propagated based on the smallest
time required for two particles/agglomerates to collide [349] or for
a single particle to change direction after it has traveled its λp [93].
The smallest collision time is estimated based on the particle positions
and  velocities,  assuming  that  particles  stick  upon  collision,  i.e.,  a
unity collision efficiency is assumed, to form agglomerates [349]. The
velocity of the newly formed agglomerate is obtained based on the
momentum conservation [93]. The agglomerate mass is obtained based
on  the  diameter,  Dp,  and  number,  Np,  of  primary  particles  in  the
aggregate or agglomerate, as well as the soot bulk density. A constant
soot  bulk  density  ρ =  1800  kg/m3  for  mature  soot  has  been  used
in most EDEM investigations [33,94,361]. Comparable values of ρ =
1400 kg/m3 have been reported for the bulk density of incipient soot
consisting of benzopyrene molecules [371]. Using such incipient soot
bulk density increases Dp by only 4% and does not practically affect
soot dynamics or the evolution of soot Dm (see Fig. S3 in [360]). The
agglomerate size is characterized by its diameter of gyration, Dg, and
mobility diameter, Dm. The aggregate or agglomerate Dg is obtained
based on its radial density distribution, while its Dm is estimated by its
projected area aa, as detailed in Section 2.3.

MCAC

As  shown  in  Fig.   21(c),  in  the  Monte  Carlo  Aggregation  Code
(MCAC), particles move in a ballistic trajectory along their persistent
distance λp during a time step Δt. The description of the particle motion
p = 6Δt  is  needed  to  ensure
as  a  random  walk  concludes  that  λ2
an  accurate  transition  from  ballistic  to  diffusive  motion  when  t ≫
τ. Taking a random change in direction after the particle traveled a
characteristic distance is the approach commonly taken in Monte Carlo
simulations [348,372]. Furthermore, by describing the particle trajec-
tory based on the Langevin equation and determining the distribution
of angles between consecutive displacements for different Δt concluded
that at least Δt = 3τ should be taken in Monte-Carlo simulations to
consider a random change of orientation in space when the particle
has traveled along,

√

6Δt,

λp =

Δt = 3τ.

(66)

The latter is determined by calculating the minimum time step required
for  the  information  entropy  of  the  distribution  of  angles  between
consecutive displacements to reach 99% of its asymptotic value [95].

Fig. 21.  Schematic of EDEM and MCAC agglomeration and surface growth modeling.

Thus, this approach will guarantee a good agreement between Monte
Carlo and Langevin Dynamics for an individual particle. In addition,
the dynamics of a population of polydisperse particles can be serialized
(move one particle at the time) by defining a displacement probability
pi ∝ 1∕Δti. This probability simply means that smaller particles (with
smaller  τ)  will  be  displaced  more  frequently  than  larger  particles
(with larger τ). Then, the probability of particle displacement can be
normalized as,

mined by the slowest particle in the domain having a displacement time

a fraction ∑
i 1∕(Δtmax∕Δti) of Δtmax, and the physical residence time of
the population of particles between time iteration k and k + 1 will be

Detailed stochastic population balance model

Unlike EDEM or MCAC, the DSPB model does not track the motion
of  soot  particles  in  the  simulation  volume.  In  the  DSPB  model,  a
particle (a soot aggregate) is described mathematically using a type-
space schematically shown in Fig.  22. An aggregate Pq formed by Np
overlapping primary particles is expressed as

Pq = Pq(p1, p2, ... , pNp
where a primary particle pi in particle Pq is represented as

, C)

pi = pi(ηi, ri, xi)

(69)

(70)

where ηi denotes the composition, such as the numbers of C and H, ri
is the primary particle radius, and xi is the position of the ith primary
particle relative to the center of mass of aggregate Pq. The primary
particles in aggregates are stored in a binary tree data structure, which
enhances the computational performance but also imposes some con-
straints on the primary particle connectivity [41,97,352]. The binary
tree data structure is embedded in the connectivity matrix C in Eq. (69),
which is a binary lower triangular matrix of dimension Np(Pq) × Np(Pq)

Cij =

{0,
1,

(71)

The binary tree data structure has been described in detail in [97,
99]. Although this data structure permits efficient access to primary
particles and their properties, it does not allow for multiple overlaps
between primary particles or looped structures [97].

When a coagulation event between two particles, say Pq and Pr, is
chosen based on their coagulation rate given in Eq. (72) [373], the
orientations and contact point between the two colliding particles are
determined by performing ballistic cluster-cluster aggregation (BCCA)
with a random impact parameter. The colliding and sticking of particles
Pq and Pr are schematically illustrated in Fig.  23. Modeling of particle
coagulation starts by randomly rotating particles Pq and Pr around their
centers of mass and calculating their bounding spheres. A random di-
rection is then generated, which is the collision direction, by uniformly
selecting a point on a sphere centered on particle Pq. Next, a random
impact parameter is applied by placing particle Pr at a random point
in the plane perpendicular to the collision direction. Further details of
BCCA algorithm can be found in [97]. Upon coagulation of particles,
Pq and Pr, a new particle Ps is formed and the connectivity matrix is
updated.

5.3.3. Surface growth and oxidation
EDEM

Although PAH adsorption may play a more important role to soot
surface growth than HACA under some flame conditions or in a certain
region of diffusion flames, such as in the centerline region of lami-
nar coflow diffusion flames [254], in inverse diffusion flames [255],
in normal diffusion flames at elevated pressures [256], and in rich
premixed flames [257], only the HACA mechanism has currently been
implemented into EDEM as the soot surface growth process. The con-
tribution of PAH adsorption to soot surface growth can be incorporated
into EDEM in a similar manner as HACA described below.  That way,
as shown in Fig.  21(b), the total number of C2H2 reactions with soot
taking place between two particle collisions is obtained [33]. The C2H2
reactions are not distributed uniformly among all primary particles to
account for the random walk of C2H2 molecules and H atoms that are
present at very low concentrations in typical flame conditions [29].
Each  C2H2  molecule  reacts  sequentially  with  a  single  soot  primary
particle (either spherical or within an aggregate/agglomerate) selected
stochastically based on the probability, γ, obtained by the ratio of C2H2
reaction rate over its collision rate [33]. So, large soot particles have
higher probabilities to react with an acetylene molecule than small
particles [33]. This results in the formation of polydisperse soot pri-
mary particles that significantly impact soot light absorption [371] and
scattering [81]. The increase in primary particle diameter is estimated
by a mass balance [94]

6

where Dp,0 is the initial primary particle diameter before the reaction
takes place and m2C is the mass of two carbon atoms contributed by
the addition of one acetylene molecule [239].

pρp =

πD3

(79)

When acetylene molecules collide and react with primary particles
within aggregates or agglomerates, they increase the particle mass by
two carbon atoms [94], forming chemical bonds and necking between
these primary particles (aggregation). The real mass and surface area
of such chemically-bonded primary particles are estimated using the
Vorlume  software  [358].  This  is  an  exact  method  that  decomposes
the volume of the union of primary particles into convex regions. The
volume estimated this way has been validated with analytical relations
for nanoparticle sintering [359].

The EDEM-derived surface growth dynamics have been validated
with a moving sectional model for spheres [33], as well as with a
monodisperse population balance model for aggregates [243]. Most
importantly, the EDEM-derived surface growth, aggregation, and ag-
glomeration dynamics are in excellent agreement with data from pre-
mixed [94], diffusion [360] and spray [361] flames.

Surface oxidation of EDEM-derived soot aggregates and agglomer-
ates has been elucidated only at high O2 concentrations (21 vol%)

39

F. Liu et al.

[185]. At these conditions, all soot primary particles can be accessed by
O2 molecules and thus oxidation reactions can be distributed uniformly.
So, the diameter of each primary particle can be derived using the
shrinking particle model [185]:

Dp = Dp,0 −

2ω
ρ

Δt

(80)

where ω is the specific oxidation rate of soot and Δt is the time step.
In essence, this model considers soot oxidation as a negative surface
growth process. This shrinking particle model has been validated [185]
with experiments of diffusion flame soot [374] and carbon black [375]
oxidized at high temperatures.

MCAC

As shown in Fig.  21(d), the increase in primary particle diame-
ter from Dp(t) to Dp(t + Δt) during a time step Δt is determined as
follows [31,34],

Dp(t + Δt) = Dp(t) + 2uΔt

(81)

where u is the particle surface growth speed (m s−1). The latter is
determined as u = φg∕ρp where φg is the local surface reaction flux
(kg m−2 s−1) and can be provided by macro-scale approaches, and ρp is
the particle bulk mass density (kg m−3). In this context, when φg < 0,
oxidation takes place while φg > 0 leads to surface growth. It is useful
to emphasize that while surface growth is treated stochastically based
on probability in EDEM discussed above, surface growth is treated in
a deterministic manner in MCAC. Such a fundamental difference in
handling soot particle surface growth results in different predictions of
primary particle polydispersity.

In MCAC, the surface and volume of aggregates containing over-
lapped spheres can be done accurately as a post-process using the SBL
libraries [358]. But this process is time-consuming and to speed up
calculation, these volumes and surfaces are approximated during MCAC
simulation by the following laws. For an aggregate consisting of Np
overlapped primary particles, its volume and surface are determined as
∑i=Np
p,i, respectively. The volume
v = αv
i=1
and surface area correction factors αv and αs are determined as [34],

soot  particle  surface  growth  is  attributed  to  both  surface  reactions
with gaseous hydrocarbons, i.e., the HACA mechanism, and the PAH
adsorption.  In  the  DSPB  algorithm,  the  surface  reactions  on  a  soot
particle  undergoing  surface  growth  are  described  by  the  KMC-ARS
model  [247,370] for the growth of PAHs inside the particle. Assuming
the surface growth rate ωg (particle mass gain per unit surface area per
unit time) is known, which is typically obtained from the macro-scale
modeling, the amount of mass added to particle Pq during a time step
Δt through surface growth is

Δm = ωgAfreeΔt

(83)

j=1

where Afree is the total free or available surface area of particle Pq for
surface reactions, i.e., Afree = ∑Np(Pq )
Aj with Np(Pq) and Aj being the
number of primary particles in particle Pq and the free surface area of
primary particle pj , respectively. The change in particle mass Δm can be
converted to a change in particle volume by using the particle density,
i.e., Δv = Δm∕ρp. A schematic representation of particle Pq formed by
overlapping spherical primary particles and undergoing surface growth
is shown in Fig.  24. It is noticed that the free surface area of a primary
particle refers only to its exposed area to gaseous species and can be
calculated by its radius and the center-to-center distances between this
primary particle and its neighbors. For example, for primary particle
pi in Fig.  24, its free surface can be calculated from ri and dij (here j
refers to all primary particles that overlap with pi).

In DSPB modeling, the amount of volume increase to particle Pq due
to surface growth, Δv, is added solely to a primary particle pi, which
is indicated by the shaded area in Fig.  24, selected according to the
probability

P (pi) =

∑

Ai
j=1 Np(Pq)Aj

.

(84)

Consequently, the radius of primary particle pi becomes larger as shown
schematically in Fig.  24 by the red dashed lines. This implementation
of soot particle surface growth in DSPB shares similarities with that in
EDEM, i.e., it is stochastic in nature and the mass gain from surface
reactions is all added to a single primary particle within the selected
aggregate, though the probability for the selection of primary particle
is different. The radius of primary particle pi after the event of surface
growth becomes

nc c10 + βs

(82b)

ri(t + Δt) = ri(t) +

Δv
Ai

.

(85)

where nc , ci0 are the average and i’th moment of the overlapping coef-
ficients, respectively. Also, βv and βs are constants [34]. The overlap
of  two  primary  particles  i  and  j  is  determined  by  the  overlapping
coefficient  Cov = (ri + rj − dij )∕(ri + rj )  where  dij  is  their  center-
center distance and ri + rj the sum of their radii. On the other hand,
oxidation leads to a continuous reduction in primary particle size and
therefore possible bond breaking or fragmentation, as discussed in a
recent study [163]. In practical terms, for any pair of primary particles
i and j belonging to an aggregate, their overlapping coefficient can be
monitored and aggregates are detached when Cov < 0. In addition,
considering  that  MCAC  simulations  only  consider  primary  particles
with a diameter larger than the critical coalescence diameter defined
in Section 1.1, particles should be deleted from the simulation system
when they reach this threshold value [163].

DSPB

In DSPB modeling, surface growth is treated as a linear process,
i.e., surface growth affects only single particles independently of other
particles in the simulation volume. Linear processes are delayed and
performed only at the end of each simulation time step to speed up
the DSPB modeling [99,280]. However, this treatment may introduce
errors in the calculation of particle–particle coagulation rates. A miti-
gation strategy is to perform surface growth to the two particles chosen
for coagulation before they coagulate [99]. As discussed in Section 3.4,

When the radius of the primary particle pi is enlarged, it not only
increases the volume of pi but also reduces the volumes of adjacent
primary particles that either overlap or are in point contact with pi.
These  changes  in  the  volumes  of  pi  lead  to  corresponding  changes
in their compositions if the compositions of individual pi within an
aggregated are being tracked [97]. Although soot oxidation has not
been explicitly incorporated into DSPB modeling, it can be treated in a
similar manner to surface growth but accounting for mass loss instead
of mass gain [99].

5.4. Applications of meso-scale methods to soot modeling

Table  4 presents a list of soot formation studies using meso-scale
approaches conducted in the last two decades or so. The list is by
no means exhaustive, especially regarding DSPB simulations reviewed
in detail in Ref. [99]. Nevertheless, it is evident that meso-scale ap-
proaches  have  been  increasingly  used  to  simulate  soot  particle  ag-
gregation  with  concurrent  surface  growth  in  laminar  flames,  spray
combustion reactors, and laminar flow reactors. This trend is likely
related to the increasingly available computational resources needed
for meso-scale simulations. Common assumptions in these simulations
involve decoupled aggregation from inception, constant particle and
flame  properties.  Most  of  these  studies  took  soot  aggregation  into
account. Early DEM works considered a constant aggregation regime,

5.5. Meso-scale codes validation

MCAC is a public access project available via GitLab [379], which
is constantly maintained and contains validated codes tested any time
a modification is introduced. The trajectories of individual particles
simulated by MCAC have been validated by a rigorous comparison with
theory and Langevin Dynamics simulations and have been theoretically
shown to be described as a binomial process characteristic of random
walks [95]. This mathematical tool is used to ensure that the asymptotic
particle trajectories are consistent with a diffusive motion predicted
by Einstein theory. The physical properties defining the trajectories
of MCAC simulated particles, namely the particle persistence distance
and  its  corresponding  time  step,  were  derived  to  accurately  match
the Langevin equation [95]. Thus, the MCAC predicted particles tra-
jectories  exhibit  a  transition  between  ballistic  and  diffusive  motion
consistent with the Langevin equation. In addition, the accurate and
consistent model of a population of polydisperse particles in a Monte
Carlo approach has been achieved for the first time in MCAC sim-
ulations  [95,96]  and  validated  through  a  detailed  comparison  with
theory [218] and sectional simulations [34]. The agglomeration ki-
netics  at  early  stages  (before  reaching  self-preserving)  were  found
satisfactory compared with proven coagulation theories [166]. MCAC-
derived collision kernels have also been validated by a detailed com-
parison with those predicted by Langevin Dynamics first time passage
simulations [96]. Homogeneity coefficients describing the particle ki-
netics  under  different  regimes  have  been  validated  by  comparison
to  theory  and  simulations  showing  the  correct  asymptotic  limits  of
aggregation [96]. MCAC modeling under more realistic conditions re-
lated to soot formation including surface reactions (surface growth and
oxidation including fragmentation) and inception has been validated
by comparison in simple cases with analytical solutions [377].

Similarly, EDEM has been validated with literature theories and
numerical models. For example, the collision frequency of coalescing
spheres derived by EDEM [93] closely followed the Fuchs interpolation
formula that bridges the free molecular and continuum regimes [215].
The  EDEM-derived  self-preserving  size  distributions  of  particles  co-
agulating  by  coalescence  (forming  single  spheres)  or  agglomeration
(forming agglomerates of spheres in point contact) were in excellent
agreement with those obtained in the free molecular and continuum
regimes by fixed sectional models [93]. The impact of numerical dif-
fusion on EDEM has been quantified by simulating the dynamics of
polydisperse  soot  particles  during  surface  growth.  As  expected,  the
soot particle size distribution was narrowed by surface growth [33].
So,  the  EDEM-derived  geometric  standard  deviation  of  the  particle
size distribution decreased with increasing time, following closely that
obtained by a moving sectional model (MSM) for surface growth and
confirming  that  EDEM  simulations  are  not  impacted  by  numerical
diffusion [33]. The evolution of the soot volume fraction and number
density during coagulation by coalescence and surface growth obtained
by EDEM closely followed those calculated by MSM [33]. The real
volume  and  surface  area  of  EDEM-derived  soot  aggregates  formed
by concurrent surface growth and agglomeration were estimated by
the exact method of the Vorlume software [358]. The evolution of
the  aggregate  surface  area  and  neck  radius  derived  by  a  DEM  for
sintering of particle chains using this Vorlume software [359] was in
good agreement with those estimated by Kirchhof et al. [380] using
the fractional volume of fluid method, Pokluda et al. [381] using the
extended Frenkel-Eshelby model, and Koch & Friedlander [382] using a
phenomenological fusion model. The EDEM-derived gyration diameter
of soot particles under surface growth and agglomeration [33] was also
in good agreement with the Monte Carlo simulations of Mitchell [383]
at small residence times in flames when particle-cluster agglomeration
and surface growth dominate. In summary, the dynamics of spheres,
aggregates, and agglomerates obtained by EDEM have been thoroughly
validated with plenty of literature theoretical and numerical models.

notably ballistic [366,368], or diffusive [367]. However, the residence
time  of  diffusion-limited  models  is  extremely  long  (∼  h)  compared
to common flame conditions (∼ hundreds of ms). The assumption of
ballistic aggregation may only hold for early residence times when
particles are commonly much smaller than their persistent distance.
Soot aggregation commonly takes place in the transition regime [206].
Only a few DEM studies have included additional mechanisms relevant
to soot formation in flames such as continuous inception [163], surface
growth [33,34,94], and oxidation without fragmentation [185] and
with oxidation-induced fragmentation [163,188].

In addition, due to their quasi-first principles nature and their ability
to predict detailed morphology of aggregates, meso-scale models can be
used to improve continuum dynamics or macroscopic modeling of soot
formation. As mentioned in Section 3.3, meso-scale simulations have
been used in previous works to propose accurate interpolation formulas
for collision kernels in the transition regime, to account for van der
Waals and Coulomb interactions, and high particle concentrations. This
also includes models for aggregate’s mobility diameter as discussed in
Section 2.3. Power laws and analytical relations for the fractal dimen-
sion have been derived from DEM simulations [93]. As mentioned in
Section 5.3.3, meso-scale simulations can also help improve models for
the power-law correlation between the ratio of aggregate projected area
Aa to that of the primary particle Ap with the number of monomers Np
as originally proposed by Medalia [116]. Brasil et al. [92] observed
an increase in the correlation constants kα and α with increasing the
degree of primary particle overlap coefficient Cov using numerically
generated aggregates of monodisperse primary particles with varying
degree of overlap added as a post-processing step. More recent works
based on DEM simulations have proposed corrected expressions for
more realistic overlapping related to sintering [376], and soot surface
growth [377]. Both parameters kα and α may also depend on primary
particle  polydispersity  as  proposed  by  Eggersdorfer  et  al.  [378].  A
monodisperse population balance model interfaced with these relations
was able to simulate accurately the soot coagulation and surface growth
dynamics at high [243] and low [297] temperatures, finding excellent
agreement with several experimental data. So the relations for the soot
morphology derived by meso-scale methods can improve substantially
the accuracy of macro-scale combustion models.

Another important application of meso-scale methods is to generate
soot aggregates. Such soot aggregates produced on physical ground are
clearly more realistic than those simulated using a tunable algorithm
discussed  in  Section  5.1  in  terms  of  morphological  features  (PPSD,
primary  particle  overlap,  and  fractal  parameters)  and  can  be  used
as input into other numerical methods for detailed investigation of
the physical and optical properties of soot particles, such as the DDA
code [112].

In Fig.  25, we compile a range of experimental data pertaining to the
fractal dimension, mass-mobility exponent, effective density, geometric
standard  deviation,  particle  size  distributions,  and  mobility  diame-
ters  of  soot  particles  generated  under  both  premixed  and  diffusion
flame conditions. Where possible, we also include previously published
numerical  results  obtained  using  EDEM  and  MCAC  methodologies,
facilitating a direct comparison between simulations and experiments.
As shown in Fig.  25a, a surprising decrease in the fractal dimension
of aggregates as a function of the primary particle diameter has been
observed when compiling data from different experiments involving
different types of colloid particles [384]. It is even more intriguing
that such fractal dimension can even be below the DLCA limit. MCAC
simulations [34] have lead to a similar conclusion for the aggregation
of particles under flame conditions but different diameters up to around
200 nm. This evolution has been attributed to considering the simul-
taneous transition in aggregation (particle–particle) and flow regimes
(particle-gas) which was not the case of previous works (e.g., DLCA
and BLCA). In addition, MCAC simulations consider a specific method
to describe the friction coefficient of aggregates by considering the
size and regime of primary particles which may explain the strong
importance of primary particle size in DEM derived aggregates fractal
dimension.

In this regard, EDEM simulations of soot dynamics were able to
explain several experimental datasets available in the literature. For
example,  the  mobility  size  distribution  derived  by  EDEM  for  soot
surface growth and agglomeration (Fig.  25(e): red line) [33] was in
excellent agreement with scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS; Fig.
25(e): triangles) [155] and helium ion microscopy (HIM; Fig.  25(e):
squares)  [363]  measurements  in  the  benchmark  premixed  burner-
stabilized  stagnation  ethylene  flame,  explaining,  for  the  first  time,
the  formation  of  small,  compact  nascent  soot  aggregates  observed
at  these  conditions.  The  primary  particle  and  quasi  self-preserving
mobility size distributions derived by EDEM [360] closely followed
the size distributions measured commonly in diffusion flames [385]
and commercial CAST generators [386]. The morphology of the EDEM-
derived soot aggregates and agglomerates has been quantified by their
Df  (Fig.  25(b): solid line) and mass-mobility exponent [94]. That way,
the asymptotic Df = 3 and 1.91 of small nascent soot spheres (Np = 1)
and large mature soot agglomerates (Np > 100) were bridged [94],
finding  excellent  agreement  with  experimental  data  from  premixed
ethylene (Fig.  25(b): squares) [363] and diffusion 1-decene (Fig.  25(b):
triangles) flames [387]. It should be noted that the EDEM-derived frac-
tal dimension reported in Fig.  25(b) has been obtained assuming that
single spheres have a fractal dimension of 3, as the fractal scaling law is
not accurate for clusters consisting just a few primary particles. If there
are both single spheres and aggregates/agglomerates in the simulation
box, the fractal dimension of EDEM-derived aggregates/agglomerates is
estimated excluding the spheres. Based on the aggregate/agglomerate
fractal dimension obtained that way, the assumed fractal dimension of
spheres and the number-based fraction of spheres in the simulation box,
the average fractal dimension is estimated.

The mass distribution and mass-mobility exponent of EDEM-derived
nascent soot aggregates were also in good agreement with those mea-
sured  by  CPMA  in  a  premixed  ethylene  flame.  So,  easy-to-use  re-
lations for the soot Np and effective density, ρeff, were derived by
EDEM to assist macro-scale models to account for the realistic fractal-
like soot structure. These power laws have been validated with sev-
eral experimental datasets of flame-made organic and even inorganic
nanoparticles. For instance, in Fig.  25(c), the soot ρeff estimated by
the EDEM-derived power law is compared to those measured for soot
nanoparticles having Dp = 16.2 (triangles), 29.6 (circles), 9 (squares),
and 18 nm (diamonds) produced using the CAST generator or premixed
flames. Based on the EDEM-derived power law, the soot ρeff is invariant
with the particle Dp when presented as a function of the normalized
mobility diameter, Dm∕Dp. This explains the small variation of the
measured soot ρeff between the various datasets presented in Fig.  25(c).

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 110 (2025) 101234

The EDEM-derived power law can describe rather accurately the mea-
sured soot ρeff, resulting in average errors of 12.5 and 9.4% for CAST
and premixed flame soot, respectively. In order to assess the relative
accuracy of the mesoscale models presented in this manuscript, MCAC
was also compared to some of the experimental datasets shown in Fig.
25. The nascent soot mobility size distribution derived by MCAC (Fig.
25(e): black line) is in good agreement with that obtained EDEM (Fig.
25(e): red line) and those measured by SMPS (Fig.  25(e): triangles) and
HIM (Fig.  25(e): squares) in a premixed ethylene flame. However, the
soot ρeff estimated by MCAC deviates significantly from that obtained
using EDEM. In particular, MCAC estimates the soot ρeff based on a
semi-empirical relation derived using experimental measurements of
CAST soot. The soot ρeff obtained that way varies with Dp. So, the soot
ρeff estimated using this relation results in, on average, 12.3 and 82.2%
error when compared to those measured for CAST and premixed flame
soot, respectively.

On the other hand, Fig.  25d shows a comparison of the geometric
standard deviation of MCAC simulations in terms of mobility, gyration,
and volume-equivalent diameters of soot particles under aggregation
and surface growth in a premixed flame [34]. Fig.  25f, compares a Df -
moment average gyration diameter predicted by MCAC simulations and
compared  to  multi-angle  light-scattering  measurements  [388].  Even
though the simulations and measurements show diameters in the same
order of magnitude, these MCAC simulations seem to underestimate
the experimentally measured gyration diameters, which has been at-
tributed to difficulties to accurately predict volume fraction and surface
reactions, including surface growth, in the current version of macro-
scale  CoFlame  used  as  an  input  for  MCAC.  Thus,  although  meso-
scale  methods  generally  show  a  good  agreement  with  experiments
related  to  premixed  flames,  the  accurate  prediction  of  soot  in  dif-
fusion flames remains challenging due to the different simultaneous
phenomena including nucleation, aggregation, and surface reactions.

The DSPB model developed by Kraft and co-workers [97,99,252,
278,352,390] has been implemented into the MOpS Particle Simulator
code, also available on GitHub [391]. The code has been validated
against benchmark solutions to simple problems of spherical particle
coagulation. Patterson et al. [373] validated the DSPB model in the
prediction of dynamics of particles undergoing pure coalescence in air
at 500 K and 600 bar under two different conditions against direct
solution of PBE using an ODE (ordinary differential equation) solver.
In the first test case, the initial monodisperse particle diameter and
number density are 0.88 nm and 6.56 × 1011/cm3, respectively. In the
second case, there are no particles initially and particles of 0.88 nm in
diameter are incepted at a rate of 2.63 × 1013 × [(0.05 − t)∕0.05]2 cm−3
s−1. The particle density takes the value of 1.8 g/cm3. Under these
conditions, the Knudsen numbers are approximately in the range of 5
to 20, i.e., in the transition and near-continuum regimes. The results
of DSPB model are compared with the direct solutions in Fig.  26. The
results of DSPB model are in very good agreement with the benchmark
solutions  in  both  cases,  though  they  display  some  scatters  at  large
particle diameters.

The DSPB model has also been tested in pure coagulation of mono
disperse spherical primary particles undergoing ballistic-limited cluster-
cluster agglomeration (BLCA) [78]. The DSPB model predicted sizes
of agglomerate as measured by the number of primary particles, Np,
against the ratio of collision diameter to the primary particle diameter,
Dc∕Dp, in log–log scale are plotted in Fig.  27. It is noticed that the
agglomerate collision diameter is defined as the gyration diameter. A
linear fit to all the agglomerates returns a fractal dimension of 1.93
(the slope of the linear fit), which is in close agreement with the value
(1.91 ± 0.03) reported by Jullien [392].

In addition to the above validation against pure particle coagulation
under coalescence and agglomeration conditions, the DSPB model has
also been applied to model soot volume fraction and particle size dis-
tributions in a plug flow reactor [279], soot particle size distributions
in premixed flames at atmospheric pressure [197,198,205,353] and at

elevated pressures [373]. In these studies, the results of DSPB model
have been compared with experimental data. In [373], the DSPB model
results of soot volume fraction were also shown to agree better with the
experimental data than the results of MOM.

5.6. Summary of meso-scale methods

Meso-scale  methods,  especially  the  three  commonly  used  ones,
namely EDEM, MCAC, and DSPB model, have been increasingly applied
to study soot particle aggregation at individual particle level in the
presence of surface growth and oxidation (see Table  4). As concluded

from Table  4 and Fig.  25, some important progress has been achieved
in simulating soot formation in premixed flames however, diffusion and
turbulent flames remain challenging. Although the three meso-scale
methods discussed above have all been developed on the same underly-
ing physics governing interactions between particles and gas molecules,
they differ in some important aspects concerning the complex fractal-
like  morphology  of  soot  particles  as  compared  in  Table   3,  such  as
the aggregate mobility size and how surface growth is handled. These
differences among the meso-scale methods will likely result in different
soot aggregate size and morphological properties. A direct comparison

of the results obtained by EDEM and MCAC in several well-defined test
cases is provided in the next section.

6. Case study of modeling soot particle agglomeration using meso-
and macro-scale methods

In this section, test cases of particle agglomeration without and
with surface growth are simulated using different approaches. These
methods  include  the  meso-scale  MCAC  and  EDEM  approaches  and
two macro-scale methods (moment and sectional methods). Through a
direct comparison and analysis of the results of these four approaches
for simple and well controlled conditions, we hope to gain a clear
understanding of the causes responsible for the differences in their
results,  especially  in  the  predicted  particle  morphology  by  the  two
meso-scale methods. A total of 3 cases are simulated considering pure
agglomeration (without surface growth) of monodisperse (Case 1) and
polydisperse (Case 2) primary particles. Case 3 considers particle ag-
glomeration with surface growth. The focus of this case study is particle
agglomeration kinetics and surface growth. Hence soot oxidation was
not considered. Although these test cases are much simpler than soot
formation in flames, they are selected based on the considerations that
only under simple and well controlled conditions that the causes for
discrepancies in the predicted particle size distributions and particle
morphology can be clearly identified and understood.

In all the meso-scale simulations the domain consists of a cubic box
with periodic boundary conditions. The simulations are initialized with
a total of 1000 (EDEM) or 1024 (MCAC) randomly distributed primary
particles in the simulation box. The initial size of the simulation domain
is determined based on the particle volume fraction. Primary particles
are assumed spherical and they stick or agglomerate upon collision with
unitary probability. Agglomeration of particles leads to a reduction of
the number of particles in the domain and thus both EDEM and MCAC
consider domain duplication as previously discussed in Section 5.3.2.
When surface growth is present, the volume and surface area of soot
aggregates considering primary particle overlapping are determined
based on specific methods as detailed below. In addition, aggregates
are simulated as rigid bodies without considering rotation. In all the
simulations, the particle bulk density (or true density) is constant at
1.8 g/cm3 corresponding to mature soot [393,394]. Unless otherwise
indicated,  the  simulations  are  conducted  at  a  constant  temperature
of  1830  K  and  atmospheric  pressure.  Additional  details  related  to
these simulations are given in the following sub-sections. It should
be  noted  that  some  of  the  simplified  conditions  considered  in  this
section can be used to describe accurately soot dynamics in premixed
flames. For example, the mass [81] and mobility [33] size distributions

44

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 110 (2025) 101234

derived by EDEM of soot surface growth and agglomeration at the
conditions specified in the third test case were in excellent agreement
with  those  measured  by  microscopy  and  scanning  mobility  particle
sizers in a premixed ethylene flame having a maximum temperature
of 1830 K [155]. Similarly, the mobility size distribution derived by
EDEM of carbon black surface growth and agglomeration under the
conditions of the third test case were in excellent agreement with those
measured for carbon black produced in a furnace reactor [149]. So,
the conditions considered in the third test case are representative of
soot and carbon black formation in rich premixed flames and furnace
reactors, respectively.

The  sectional  method  and  method  of  moments  are  selected  as
representative macro-scale methods of particle dynamics as these types
of method have often been used in sooting flame modeling. For these
test cases, the PBE does not include advection, thermophoresis, and
diffusion  (see  Eq.  (35)  for  the  generic  form  of  PBE).  In  both  the
SM and MOM, we assume a constant fractal dimension of 1.78 and
a  prefactor  of  1.30.  These  values  are  selected  since  similar  values
have commonly been imposed in PBE simulations of soot formation in
flames in the literature [43,196,211,254]. We note that some efforts
to implement variable fractal dimension in time have been made in
the literature [243,297,307,350]. The sectional method used here is a
modified version of the NGDE code developed by Prakash et al. [395]
which has been adapted to simulate aggregation [95] and is publicly
available through GitLab [218]. A detailed description of this sectional
method can be found in the referenced studies and here we only provide
a brief description. The size distribution of aggregates is distributed
logarithmically in terms of aggregate volume considering a total of 41
sections (or size bins) starting at the initial primary particle geometric
mean  diameter  up  to  4  orders  of  magnitude  from  this  value.  This
number of sections represents a good compromise between accuracy
and computational cost which is especially relevant when considering
the resolution of the flow and chemical species transport equations.
The size distribution is integrated in time considering a dynamic time
step calculated from the coagulation kernels as explained in [218].
For both the sectional and moments method, the coagulation kernels
are  determined  based  on  the  transition  regime  model  proposed  by
Gopalakrishnan et al. [234] (Equation 14 in this reference). The colli-
sion radius of aggregates is determined based on Thajudeen et al. [223]
(Equations 21 to 23 in this reference). The friction coefficient of ag-
gregates  is  determined  as  for  MCAC,  based  on  the  method  of  Yon
et al. [153].

For the MOM simulations, the DQMOM in a volume-surface formu-
lation was selected, as explained in Section 4.2.4. Two delta functions
(Nδ = 2) are used for the quadrature approximation. In terms of the
selected set of moments, the results of DQMOM are not unique but
depend somewhat on this set. The best results of DQMOM, which give
the closest agreement with those of EDEM and MCAC, were found for
the following set of 3Nδ moments: m0,0, m1,0, m0,1, m2,0, m4,−3, and
m−2,3. These are physically related to number density, soot volume
fraction,  specific  surface,  volume  squared,  mean  diameter  d6,3,  and
mean number of primary particles, respectively. For the numerical in-
tegration, a simple forward Euler method was used, ensuring time-step
independence.

6.1. Case 1: Agglomeration of monodisperse primary particles

Primary particles of diameters Dp,geo = 40 nm and Dp,geo = 8 nm
are simulated. The particle volume fraction is 10 ppb and simulations
end at a residence time of 8 s and 100 ms for Dp,geo = 40 nm and
Dp,geo = 8 nm, respectively. These diameters are selected based on the
considerations that they are representative primary soot particles in the
early stage of soot formation (Dp,geo = 8 nm) or in flames of heavily
sooting liquid fuels (Dp,geo = 40 nm), e.g. Jet A-1 [396]. The results
of Cases 1 and 2 are compared in Fig.  28. Columns 1 and 2 of Fig.
28 show a direct comparison of MCAC, EDEM, and population balance

Fig. 28.  Comparison of the results of MCAC, EDEM, sectional, and MOM simulations for pure agglomeration cases considering different primary particle size distributions. Column
1 compares the results of monodisperse primary particles (σp,geo = 1) with Dp,geo = 40 nm, while columns 2, 3 and 4 show results of the same Dp,geo = 8 nm but different σp,geo
of 1, 1.2, and 1.5, respectively. Each row represents a different agglomerate property of the simulation including the total aggregate number concentration (np), average primary
particle number per agglomerate (Np), geometric mean and standard deviation of gyration diameter Dg,geo and σg,geo, respectively. Fractal parameters (Df ,p, kf ,p) are obtained by
fitting Eq. (1) considering Np > 2 (the fractal plot are available in Supporting Material). The cyan dashed lines represent the self-preserving σg,geo. Both the fractal parameters and
self-preserving σg,geo are evaluated nearly the last residence time shown in the figure based on Eq. (17c) and MCAC simulations (see S2 of the Supporting Material).

simulations of pure agglomeration of monodisperse particles (σp,geo = 1)
for Dp,geo = 40 nm and Dp,geo = 8 nm, respectively. The variations
of particle number concentration with time predicted by MCAC and
EDEM are in good agreement for Dp,geo = 40 nm while in the case
of Dp,geo = 8 nm EDEM predicted a slower decrease in the particle
number concentration, i.e., it predicted slower coagulation dynamics
than  MCAC.  These  two  cases  correspond  to  near-transition  (initial
= 190) agglomeration regimes,
KnD
respectively. The difference in agglomeration dynamics is explained
by two main factors, namely the particle persistent distances λp (and

= 17) and ballistic (initial KnD

their corresponding time step Δt), and the particle mobility diameter.
The average ratio λp∕Δt leads to an average characteristic velocity of
particle displacement, which is 12% higher for EDEM compared to
MCAC. We thus would expect larger coagulation kernels for EDEM in
the ballistic regime. However, both codes also have different models
for mobility diameters as discussed in Section 2.3.

Indeed,  as  shown  in  Fig.   6,  for  Np  larger  than  1,  the  mobility
diameter as modeled by MCAC is systematically smaller than the one
predicted by EDEM indicating that the mobility as modeled by MCAC
is larger than the one predicted by EDEM, especially at small Dp. This

45

F. Liu et al.

explain the faster coagulation dynamics of MCAC compared to EDEM
simulations observed in Fig.  28, particularly for Dp,geo = 8 nm.

The differences in coagulation kinetics lead to larger agglomerates,
in terms of Np, by MCAC as compared to EDEM in the ballistic regime
under the studied residence times, Fig.  28(f). In addition, both codes
predicted very similar evolution of Np in the near-transition regime,
Fig.  28(e). A different trend is however observed in terms of the aggre-
gate’s geometric mean gyration diameter Dg,geo. The Dg,geo predicted
by EDEM is generally larger or equal to the one predicted by MCAC,
Fig.  28(i) and (j), suggesting that the agglomerates predicted by EDEM
must have a lower fractal dimension as compared to those by MCAC.
As observed in Fig.  28(i) and (j), slightly more compact agglomerates
are  obtained  with  MCAC  as  compared  to  EDEM  due  to  the  larger
persistent distance (by a factor of 2.65) in EDEM simulations (cf. Eqs.
(66) and (64)). These population fractal parameters were determined
by fitting Eq. (1) considering Np > 2 to find Df ,p and kf ,p (see S2 in
the Supporting Material). It should be noted that the fractal parameters
obtained here for EDEM-derived agglomerates are lower than those
reported previously [33,33,93], which included single spherical par-
ticles in the fractal parameter estimation. In addition, the aggregate
size polydispersity is quantified by the gyration diameter geometric
standard deviation σg,geo shown in the last row of Fig.  28. The latter is
naturally increasing with time due to agglomeration and remains below
the self-preserving limit predicted by Eq. (17c) determined based on
the homogeneity coefficient of the gyration diameter size distribution
of MCAC simulations evaluated at the end of the simulation time. It
should be noted that the self-preserving limit requires large aggregates
(at least 20 primary spheres, see [96]) to be reached, which is hardly
the case in the current simulation. In addition, the self-preservation
approach is theoretically based on a constant homogeneity coefficient
during time, which is not the case here since the particles undergo
a change in flow regime over time. The MCAC and EDEM predicted
similar evolution of σg,geo for the Dp,geo = 40 nm case at relatively
short residence times up to about 5 s, Fig.  28(m). At longer residence
times, however, the discrepancies between the two codes grow and
the σg,geo of MCAC reaches a maximum polydispersity closer to the
one expected for the self-preserving limit while the EDEM predicted a
lower polydispersity. For the case of Dp,geo = 8 nm, MCAC predicted
consistently larger σg,geo than EDEM, though both codes predicted a
maximum value of σg,geo at 100 ms close to the self-preserving poly-
dispersity  expected  for  the  ballistic  regime  σg,geo = 2.27  according
to [93], Fig.  28(n). The asymptotic geometric standard deviation of
the gyration diameter, σg,geo ≈ 2 derived by both EDEM and MCAC
is in good agreement with the asymptotic σg,geo = 2.04 measured for
ZrO2 agglomerates of polydisperse primary particles growing mostly by
coagulation in a spray flame [397]. We also note that σg,geo derived
from TEM image analysis of soot particles has been found between
1.82 to 1.87 [389] in premixed and between 1.61 to 2.9 in diffusion
flames [398,399]. The asymptotic σg,geo derived by MCAC and EDEM
are within this range considering that surface growth and oxidation
are not considered in these simulations. It should also be noted that
the substantially different diffusion models used by EDEM and MCAC
resulted in practically identical coagulation dynamics in the absence of
surface growth. However, the soot aggregates derived by EDEM have a
smaller fractal dimension, Df ,p, but a larger prefactor, kf ,p, compared
to those obtained by MCAC. These differences could be attributed partly
to the different particle diffusion modeling used in EDEM and MCAC.
Good agreement is observed between the sectional and EDEM ap-
proaches for both Dp,geo = 40 nm and Dp,geo = 8 nm cases in terms of
np, Np, Dg,geo, and σg,geo especially at early residence times. At larger
residence times, the sectional method predicted a faster decrease of np
for the Dp,geo = 40 nm case, which may be explained by the lower
fractal prefactor assumed in these simulations as compared to EDEM
leading to slightly enhanced coagulation kernels. In the Dp,geo = 8 nm
case, the sectional method still shows faster coagulation than EDEM but
slower than MCAC. The latter may be explained by the more ballistic

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 110 (2025) 101234

agglomeration  of  this  case  leading  to  larger  fractal  dimensions  but
lower fractal prefactors. The Dg,geo predicted by the sectional method
is in excellent agreement with EDEM. The differences observed at early
residence times, when agglomerates are small, are likely due to the poor
accuracy of the fractal law (Eq. (1)) used here to determine Dg for
each section from the agglomerate volume, primary particle volume,
and diameter. The closer agreement between the sectional method and
EDEM, as compared to MCAC, for the Dp,geo = 8 nm case could be
attributed to the similarity between the selected fractal parameters and
those obtained from EDEM for this particular case.

In terms of particle number density, computed as m0,0, the MOM
approach shows good agreement with the other methods just at the be-
ginning of the simulation, up to approximately 1 s for the Dp,geo = 40 nm
case. However, for longer residence times, the aggregation process is
slower in MOM, indicating an underprediction of the aggregation rate.
Conversely, for the Dp,geo = 8 nm case, MOM aligns well with MCAC up
to 10 ms, after which it underpredicts the particle number density com-
pared to all the other methods. As a result, the number of monomers
per aggregate (Np = 1∕(36π) m−2,3∕m0,0) is underpredicted on the whole
for the high Dp,geo case and overpredicted for the low Dp,geo case. In
terms of gyration diameter (Dg = 6∕(36πkf )1∕Df m1−2∕Df ,3∕Df −1∕m0,0),
MOM presents an overall good agreement for the high Dp,geo with other
methods, while it overpredicts its evolution on the whole for the low
Dp,geo case. This highlights the limitations of MOM in capturing the
detailed properties of soot particles when reducing the problem to a
few statistical properties. Nevertheless, given its substantially reduced
computational  requirements,  solving  only  six  differential  equations,
MOM provides an efficient and fast method for obtaining preliminary
estimates.

6.2. Case 2: Agglomeration of polydisperse primary particles

The primary particle diameters are now considered log-normally
distributed with a geometric mean Dp,geo = 8 nm and different geomet-
ric standard deviations, namely σp,geo = 1, 1.2 and 1.5. The results of
these simulations are reported in Fig.  28, from the second to fourth
columns, respectively. Soot primary particle diameters in flames are
in general fairly monodisperse, i.e., narrowly distributed, especially
within individual aggregates [400], with values of σp,geo up to 1.54 have
been previously reported in the literature for soot particles sampled
from  diffusion  or  premixed  flames  [118,401].  The  particle  volume
fraction, bulk density, and flame temperature are the same as the simu-
lations presented in the previous section for Case 1. We note that in the
first row of Fig.  28 the initial particle number concentration decreases
monotonically  with  increasing  the  σp,geo  due  to  the  increase  in  the
total particle volume when keeping constant the initial particle volume
fraction. It is intriguing to observe that increasing the σp,geo leads to
better agreement in most quantities predicted by MCAC and EDEM
in Fig.  28, except Dg,geo. This may be explained by the predominant
effect of larger particles in the system which makes the agglomeration
closer to the transition regime where the results of the two meso-scale
methods were seen in better agreement than in the ballistic regime
(see the results of Case 1 in columns 1 and 2 of Fig.  28 discussed
in the previous section). As shown in the bottom row of Fig.  28, the
geometric standard deviation of gyration diameter predicted by MCAC
is consistently larger than that by EDEM. In addition, the agglomerate
polydispersity in terms of σg,geo increases with time for all the cases but
reaches a lower maximum value at the end of the simulation (100 ms)
for larger σp,geo. These results may be explained by the longer time
required by agglomerates consisting of polydisperse monomers to reach
the self-preserving limit [96,350]. We also observe that both EDEM and
MCAC show a lower fractal dimension as σp,geo is increased which is
also in agreement with previous observations from the literature [96,
350]. In addition, the performance of the sectional method consistently
degrades in terms of np, Np, Dg,geo, and σg,geo as we increase the primary
particle polydispersity. Neglecting primary particle polydispersity as

46

F. Liu et al.

done  in  this  sectional  approach  leads  to  over-prediction  of  np  and
under-prediction of Np. This is a natural limitation of the sectional
approach as accurately simulating the evolution of primary particle
polydispersity  may  require  a  multi-dimensional  population  balance
approach where multiple additional differential equations are solved
to obtain the polydispersity of each section of the aggregate size distri-
bution. Such an approach is not considered here. A similar but likely
less accurate approach may be to model the evolution of the primary
particle size distribution assuming the same monomer distribution for
all sections of aggregates as done in [43]. In this regard, monodisperse
population balance models used EDM-derived collision frequencies en-
hanced by 1.35 [350] or 1.8 [360] to simulate soot dynamics in the free
molecular [243] and transition [297] regimes, respectively, displaying
good agreement with experimental data. We also observe that despite
the limited accuracy of the sectional method in resolving both the np
and Np, it predicted fairly accurate geometric mean Dg, suggesting
that Dg,geo seems a robust parameter during particle agglomeration.
Similarly  to  the  sectional  method,  results  from  the  MOM  approach
are also presented for the polydisperse case. The difference here lies
in the initial conditions, as the MOM formulation cannot deal with
polydispersity within aggregates. The MOM predictions are similar to
MCAC at higher levels of initial polydispersity (e.g., σp,geo = 1.5), likely
because the fractal parameters assumed in the MOM resemble those
obtained through the MCAC simulations. However, the MOM consis-
tently overpredicts the gyration diameter, which can be attributed to its
inability to fully capture the evolving polydispersity and morphology of
the aggregates. While the MOM provides reasonable agreement under
certain conditions, particularly when its prescribed parameters closely
match those determined by more detailed simulations, it still remains
less accurate in reflecting the distribution of primary particle sizes and
aggregate structures that arise as agglomeration proceeds.

Fig.   29  compares  the  aggregate  size  distributions  predicted  by
MCAC, EDEM, sectional method and method of moments in terms of the
volume equivalent diameter Dv and the gyration diameter Dg. While
Dv is a direct output from the sectional method allowing a comparison
with the results of EDEM and MCAC, the value of Dg is determined
based on Eq. (1) along with the assumed fractal parameters in the
sectional and method of moments code. Since the size distributions are
evaluated near the end of simulations, most of them look unimodal and
in good agreement between MCAC and EDEM. As observed previously
in terms of the geometric mean and geometric standard deviation of
the gyration size distribution (Fig.  28), the agreement between the
two  meso-scale  methods  and  the  sectional  approach  is  good  when
≤ 1.2). However, we
the primary particle polydispersity is low (σp,geo
notice  the  difficulties  for  the  sectional  method  to  predict  the  peak
and the left-tail of the size distributions when σp,geo further increases.
A similar trend is observed for the method of moments, which also
fails to accurately represent the details of the distribution, specially
for high primary particle polydispersity. Notably, the only scenario in
which this method aligns reasonably well with the other approaches
occurs when Dp,geo = 40 nm and the initial distribution is monodisperse.
Under all other conditions, the method of moments produces narrower
distributions than those obtained from the other methods.

6.3. Case 3: Soot aggregation with surface growth

Two different sub-cases of simultaneous soot aggregation and sur-
face growth are simulated. The prescribed total surface growth rates,
̇ω in kg m−3 s−1, for the two sub-cases are reported in Fig.  30(a).
Here,  ̇ω represents the total mass gained by particles, per unit of soot
aerosol volume, per unit of time, from the gas-phase through surface
growth. The first sub-case simulated is representative of a premixed
flame [94] and considers a constant flame temperature of 1830 K,
an initially monodisperse primary particle distribution with diameter
Dp,geo = 2 nm, and initial volume fraction of fv,0 = 0.1885 ppb. These
conditions are consistent with the measurements of incipient soot in

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 110 (2025) 101234

the benchmark premixed ethylene flame [155]. The second sub-case
simulated is representative of a carbon black furnace (the case referred
to as fv = 2.4 × 10−5 in Ref. [7]) and considers a constant temperature
of 1673 K, an initially monodisperse primary particle distribution with
diameter Dp,geo = 3 nm, and an initial volume fraction of fv,0 = 1.18 ppb.
Both sub-cases are simulated until a total residence time of 100 ms.

Fig.  30(b) and (c) show the evolution of the particle volume frac-
tion, fv, with time in the premixed flame and carbon black furnace,
respectively. The results of both MCAC and EDEM in the premixed
flame sub-case exhibit a rapid increase in fv within about the first
10 ms, which is expected from the initially high surface growth rate
shown  in  Fig.   30(a).  After  this  time,  the  fv  of  MCAC  reaches  an
asymptotic value of fv = 11 ppb, which is consistent with the expected
volume fraction based on the prescribed surface growth rate. The latter
∫ τ=t
is determined as fv(t) = ρ−1
τ=0 ̇ω(τ) dτ, where ρp is the soot bulk mass
p
density. The accuracy of MCAC depends on the method used for the
determination of the volume and surface area of aggregates formed
by  overlapping  primary  particles,  which  is  achieved  here  by  using
the αv and αs functions given in Eq. (82). The EDEM derived soot fv
approaches slowly the prescribed final fv. This can be attributed to the
discrete number of acetylene molecules and hydrogen atoms present in
the EDEM simulation by surface growth at t > 10 ms. Hence, the limited
number of surface growth species can result in statistical variations
of soot fv at long residence times. The difference in the predicted fv
between MCAC and EDEM is predominantly attributed to their differ-
ent computational implementation of surface growth (Section 5.3.3).
MOM accurately predicted the evolution of fv under prescribed surface
growth rates as compared to the reference (black dashed lines). This
high accuracy is expected because under these conditions and assuming
primary particles are in point contact, the evolution of fv becomes
independent of particle morphology. It is important to note that the
usual implementation of MOM in soot formation modeling involves
calculating surface growth rates based on particle morphology and flow
conditions, which can introduce discrepancies when compared to more
detailed methods such as EDEM and MCAC.

A very different evolution of fv is observed in the carbon black
furnace sub-case, where its evolution is slow at early residence times
but continuously increases with residence time leading to fv > 16 ppm
at t = 100 ms. Such evolution of fv is expected from the monotonically
increasing prescribed surface growth rate. In the carbon black furnace
sub-case, while the deterministic surface growth model implemented in
MCAC can accurately reproduce the theoretical volume fraction, EDEM
shows difficulties in predicting accurately fv, especially at residence
times longer than about 60 ms. Once again, the accuracy of MCAC
is dependent on the method for aggregate volume and surface area
determination when primary particles are overlapped. In the carbon
black furnace sub-case the results of MCAC were obtained by using the
SBL library [358] instead of the αv and αs functions given in Eq. (82)
used for the premixed flame sub-case. The latter method was needed in
the carbon black furnace sub-case because of the high levels of primary
particle overlapping between monomers whose diameters increase by
almost 2 orders of magnitude in time. The difference between EDEM-
derived and the prescribed fv evolution for this case can again be
attributed to the statistical variation of the EDEM simulations using a
stochastic algorithm for surface growth as explained above and in Sec-
tion 5.3.3. MOM again predicted fv evolution in excellent agreement
with the theoretically expected fv.

Fig.   31  compares  the  particle  (aggregate)  number  concentration
and geometric mean gyration diameter predicted by MCAC, EDEM,
and MOM (top row), and the aggregate gyration diameter geometric
standard deviation predicted by MCAC and EDEM for both the pre-
mixed flame (plots on the left column) and carbon black furnace (plots
on the right column) sub-cases of Case 3. Also plotted in Fig.  31(a)
are the experimental data from [155]. For the premixed flame sub-
case, MOM predicted the particle concentration evolution in excellent
agreement with MCAC. For this case, the results from all these methods,

i.e., MCAC, EDEM, and MOM, are in reasonable agreement with the
experimental  data,  though  the  particle  concentrations  predicted  by
EDEM at about < 35 ms seem to be higher than the uncertainty range
of the data. For the carbon black furnace sub-case, Fig.  31(b), MCAC
again  predicted  a  persistently  lower  particle  concentration  (or  fast
particle coagulation) than EDEM. On the other hand, MOM predicted
particle concentrations in good agreement with the results of MCAC and
EDEM at short residence times (<15 ms), but predicted increasingly
higher particle concentrations than those of MCAC and EDEM with
increasing residence time. Although MOM is able to predict accurately
the evolution of soot volume fraction in both sub-cases of Case 3, Fig.
30, its ability to predict particle dynamics or coagulation is affected
by the assumed particle morphological parameters, namely Df  and kf .
The increasingly larger deviation of particle concentration predicted by
MOM from MCAC and EDEM in the carbon black furnace sub-case is

likely attributed to the inappropriate assumption of Df = 1.78 and/or
kf = 1.3.

The  differences  in  the  particle  number  concentration  evolution
shown in Fig.  31(a) and (b), predicted by MCAC and EDEM, notably the
faster decrease predicted by MCAC, are explained by the differences in
the particle dynamics and thus in particle coagulation rate as discussed
in Section 5.3.2. This also explains the slightly lower geometric mean
gyration diameter by EDEM as compared to MCAC in both the premixed
flame (Fig.  31(c)) and carbon black furnace (Fig.  31(d)). A similar trend
to this property is predicted by the MOM approach, which displays the
same overall behavior as in the pure aggregation cases. Specifically,
in this scenario, MOM overpredicts the gyration diameter by up to a
factor of two compared to MCAC and EDEM, reflecting the limitations
of  lower-order  moment  representations  of  particle  dynamics  in  the
presence of surface growth. In addition, while fairly good agreement
is  observed  in  terms  of  the  gyration  diameter  geometric  standard

deviation σg,geo in the premixed flame (Fig.  31(e)), a considerably larger
σg,geo is observed from the EDEM results (Fig.  31(f)) for the carbon
black furnace. Considering that the opposite trend was observed for
pure  coagulation  cases  studied  in  Sections  6.1 and 6.2,  the  larger
σg,geo of EDEM compared to MCAC may be explained by their different
implementations of surface growth. There are two distinct effects that
may contribute to this explanation, namely (1) the polydispersity of
primary particles tends to decrease with surface growth in MCAC while
it tends to increase in EDEM, and (2) the strong surface growth effect
in the carbon black furnace sub-case may lead to particle coagulation
evolution towards the transition and near diffusive regime where the
MCAC predicted σg,geo has been observed to be smaller than the one of
ballistic regime [96].

Fig.  32 compares the average number of monomers per aggregate
and properties of primary particles as a function of residence time
in the premixed flame and carbon black furnace of Case 3 simulated
by both MCAC and EDEM. Results from MOM are also included for
number of monomers and primary particle diameter. The experimental
mean numbers of primary particles per agglomerate obtained based on
average mass measured using CPMA by Camacho et al. [155] are also
included in Fig.  32(c). While coagulation is faster in MCAC simulations
as compared to EDEM, it is not surprising to have larger Np for MCAC
compared to EDEM, Fig.  32(a,b). Additionally, the MOM results align
closely with MCAC predictions for the premixed flame case, whereas
for the carbon black furnace scenario, MOM predictions more closely
match those of EDEM, demonstrating that its performance can vary
depending on the operating conditions. The larger Np for MCAC is
still observed in terms of the volume-surface equivalent number of

49

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 110 (2025) 101234

monomers Nva for the premixed flame, Fig.  32(c). It is noticed that
at about 20 ms the mean number of primary particles per agglomerate
predicted by EDEM agrees better with the experimental data. At 50 ms,
however, the mean number of primary particles per agglomerate pre-
dicted by MCAC agrees well with the experimental data. It is interesting
to observe that a crossover in the predicted mean numbers of primary
particles per agglomerate by MCAC and EDEM occurs for the carbon
black furnace sub-case, Fig.  32(d). The latter may be explained by the
differences in aggregate morphology as discussed in the next section.
The second row plots of Fig.  32 display the primary particle geometric
mean volume-area equivalent diameter (Fig.  32(e–f)) and geometric
mean diameter (Fig.  32(g–h)).  Larger primary particles obtained in
MCAC simulation for both the premixed flame and carbon black furnace
sub-cases  can  be  explained  by  the  differences  observed  in  Fig.   30
related to the different implementations of surface growth. We also ob-
serve that the MOM-predicted particle diameter for the premixed flame
case remains intermediate between MCAC and EDEM, Fig.  32(e), yet
continues to grow from 10 to 100 ms, whereas the results of MCAC and
EDEM remain approximately constant. In contrast, for the carbon black
furnace scenario, the MOM underestimates particle diameter relative to
both MCAC and EDEM for the entire simulation, Fig.  32(f), displaying
the method’s sensitivity to the underlying conditions.  Finally, as shown
in the bottom row of Fig.  32, the primary particles have a relatively
narrow  distribution  with  geometric  standard  deviations  below  1.25
predicted by EDEM for both cases. The asymptotic σp,geo derived by
EDEM is in reasonably good agreement with that measured in laminar
sooting flames. In addition, the σp,geo remains constant at the initial
value (unity) for MCAC while it increases monotonically to reach a
fairly  asymptotic  value  for  EDEM.  The  difference  in  the  predicted
σp,geo  by  EDEM  and  MCAC  is  entirely  attributed  to  their  different
treatments of particle surface growth. While in EDEM simulations the
surface growth is treated stochastically at the primary particle level (the
mass is added only to a selected primary particle in an aggregate), in
MCAC all the primary particles are subject to surface growth uniformly
within the aggregate. Therefore, EDEM can account for soot primary
particle polydispersity through inception (polydisperse incipient soot
particles are initialized as in Case 2) or surface growth (Case 3), while
MCAC can predict polydisperse primary particles only if the initial
incipient soot particles are polydisperse, as in Case 2, since MCAC does
not produce primary particle polydispersity during surface growth for
initially monodisperse incipient soot particles.

Fig.  33 shows an EDEM/MCAC comparison of aggregates size dis-
tribution in terms of volume equivalent diameter Dv (top row) and
gyration diameter Dg (bottom row) for the premixed (left column) and
carbon black furnace (right column). In addition, the results from the
MOM are also presented, assuming a log-normal size distribution. All
distributions are unimodal as expected from the simultaneous aggrega-
tion and surface growth. The agreement between both codes (EDEM
and MCAC) is excellent in the premixed flame case in terms of Dv
while a small shift to larger diameters is observed in terms of Dg for
MCAC as compared to EDEM. Interestingly, in the carbon black furnace,
we observe similar size distributions in terms of Dv for both MCAC
and EDEM. However, the Dg distribution is much broader for EDEM
than for MCAC. Both codes show the same main mode, which peaks
at about 200 nm, but the Dg distribution of EDEM shows a larger
amount of smaller particles. The agreement in terms of the main mode
of the distribution is attributed to the similarities between both codes
for simulating coagulation as discussed in Sections 6.1 and 6.2. The
broader left-tail in the Dg distribution observed for EDEM as compared
to MCAC may be explained by the preferential surface growth of larger
primary particles in EDEM leading to aggregates with large friction
coefficient and thus smaller collision frequency. Regarding the MOM,
its predicted distributions are generally narrower, especially for Dg,
as  previously  noted  in  the  pure  aggregation  case.  However,  under
the premixed flame conditions, MOM still provides a reasonably good

match  in  terms  of  Dv,  and  the  mean  particle  sizes  are  not  signifi-
cantly different from those predicted by EDEM and MCAC, even with
various underlying simplifications. Thus, while the MOM cannot fully
capture the complexity of evolving aggregate structures under different
conditions, it can offer a useful approximation in scenarios where a
log-normal assumption and a limited set of parameters can adequately
describe the particle population.

6.4. Detailed morphological analysis for Cases 1, 2 and 3

The aim of this section is to present the morphological parameters
of  a  small  number  of  arbitrarily  selected  large  particles  out  of  all
those generated by the two meso-scale codes. As such, this analysis
is by no means of statistical significance. For example, the aggregate
sizes reported hereafter are not representative of those generated, as
discussed  in  the  previous  sections.   As  explained  in  Section  2.2,  a
detailed morphological analysis of each numerically produced aggre-
gate can be performed by examining its volume-based pair correlation
function. In this section, we consider the largest aggregates (in terms
of the number of primary particles Np) produced by each meso-scale
simulation (without surface growth in Cases 1 and 2, Dp,geo = 40 and
8 nm respectively with σp,geo = 1.0, 1.2 and 1.5 and with surface growth
in the premixed flame sub-case of Case 3 at residence times of 25, 50,
75 and 100 ms).

Fig.  34 displays the normalized pair correlations of four aggregates
generated by EDEM and MCAC, without surface growth (Case 1 with

(the premixed flame sub-case of Case 3, at tres = 100 ms). For both
Cases 1 (first row) and 3 (second row), we can clearly see the transition
between App (which corresponds to the pair correlation of primary
particles with themselves) and Aagg (which corresponds to the pair
correlation between different primary particles with each other). This
transition becomes less visible as the primary particles become more
polydispersed (see plot c). In any case, the results based on Eq. (4),
reported as dashed curves, are in good overall agreement with the data
points, enabling the evaluation of quantities of interest. For example,
we found the individual fractal dimension Df i = 1.69, 1.69, 1.39, and
1.91, packing factor φ = 0.75, 0.85, 2.8, and 0.68, and the stretching
exponent β = 3.48, 3,42, 2.37, and 2.12 for the aggregates shown in
plots a, b, c and d, respectively.

Fig.  35(a) reports the individual fractal dimensions of the selected
aggregates. As a reference, we also plot the asymptotic value observed
for the DLCA case [129] (the blue dashed line), which is relatively well
found in this study for the largest analyzed aggregates. For smaller
aggregates, a fractal signature is not distinguishable, explaining the
variability  of  the  reported  individual  fractal  dimensions.  From  this
point of view, there is no specific difference between MCAC and EDEM.
Fig.  35(b) displays the corresponding packing factors. This parameter
reveals the local compactness. It is larger in the case of polydisperse
aggregates (the larger values are found here for the EDEM simulation
for Dp,geo = 8 nm with σp,geo = 1.5). Surface growth activates the
primary particle overlapping which also explains the increase of the
packing factor as well as the coordination number [34]. Most of the
reported  values  are  similar  to  the  asymptotic  behavior  φ = 0.68
obtained in [131]. Nevertheless, much larger values (even larger than
1) can be found as reported in [34].

Each analyzed aggregate can also be discretized enabling the evalu-
ation of the particle anisotropy and exact gyration radius when overlap-
ping is present [130]. Heinson et al. [131] have shown the anticorrela-
tion property of this parameter with the stretching exponent for DLCA
aggregates as reported by the cyan crosses in Fig.  36(a). The present
study reveals a similar dispersion for the MCAC and EDEM simulations
without and with surface growth.

Primary  particle  overlapping  occurs  when  surface  growth  is  ac-
tivated. This is quantified by the overlapping coefficient introduced

by [92] and reported in Fig.  36(b). It appears that MCAC produces
larger overlapping than EDEM. Nevertheless, it must be noticed that
this scenario of surface growth produces smaller Cov compared to exper-
imental observations. Larger values (up to 0.5) have been observed with
MCAC for the simulation of a laminar ethylene diffusion flame [163].
Based on the above discussion, we can conclude that the morpho-
logical parameters of MCAC and EDEM produced aggregates are similar
and not too different from those of the reference DLCA aggregates,
except the primary particle polydispersity that is found to be larger for
EDEM aggregates when surface growth is activated. This is primarily
due to the different ways to implement the particle surface growth un-
der a given mass flux in EDEM and MCAC. In particular, each acetylene
reaction takes place stochastically and sequentially on the surface of
EDEM-derived soot primary particles, increasing their polydispersity.
In contrast, acetylene reactions are distributed uniformly among all
MCAC-derived primary particles without affecting their polydispersity.

6.5. Comparison of CPU times for Cases 1, 2, and 3

Table  5 compares the CPU times (in hours) of selected simulations
from Cases 1, 2, and 3 based on EDEM, MCAC, sectional, and MOM
simulations. In all cases, a total flame residence time of 100 ms was
considered. Unsurprisingly, the table shows up to 5 orders of magnitude
difference between meso-scale and macro-scale codes. Two points can
be noticed from the CPU time scaling for meso-scale models when
surface growth is included. Firstly, the inclusion of surface growth sig-
nificantly increases the CPU time of both MCAC and EDEM, especially
for the latter. This is because additional calculations of volume and
surface area of overlapping primary particles must be performed to
account for surface growth. The much higher increase in CPU time for
EDEM is attributed to its stochastic way to handle soot surface growth.
In contrast, MCAC assumed that surface growth occurs uniformly and
deterministically over all the primary particles in an aggregate (though
mass  is  only  added  to  free  surface  area).  Although  the  stochastic
approach used to simulate surface growth in EDEM requires larger
computational times than MCAC, it resulted in favorable agreement in
the predicted polydispersity of primary particle size with available ex-
perimental measurements in premixed [81] and diffusion [360] flames.
Similar distributions can also be obtained by MCAC, though a proper

initial level of primary particle polydispersity is required. Secondly, the
carbon black furnace (CBF) sub-case involves much bigger soot primary
particles than the premixed flame sub-case, which means that particle
aggregation is more diffusive in the CBF case than in the premixed
flame case. As described in previous sections, both MCAC and EDEM
consider a persistent distance to simulate the particle displacement
which becomes smaller as aggregation becomes more diffusive, making
the simulation more challenging in both EDEM and MCAC. In addition,
the much higher CPU time of the CBF sub-case of Case 3 compared to
that of the premixed flame sub-case for MCAC is also explained by the
different method of aggregate’s volume and surface area calculation as
explained above.

7. Challenges and future prospects

Meso-scale  methods  have  been  increasingly  used  to  predict  the
size and detailed morphology of individual soot particles under con-
ditions relevant to laminar sooting flames. This type of method was
developed to incorporate most of the physical and chemical processes
associated  with  soot  formation  and  soot  particle  dynamics  and  to
resolve the positions of primary particles within individual aggregates.
The main features of the three commonly used meso-scale methods,
namely the detailed stochastic population balance (DSPB) algorithm,
the  event-driven  discrete  element  method  (EDEM),  and  the  Monte
Carlo aggregation code (MCAC), were discussed with their differences
highlighted in Section 5. In particular, the performance of EDEM and

52






F. Liu et al.

MCAC  was  directly  compared  in  several  test  cases  of  soot  particle
aggregation without and with surface growth. It is unexpected that
EDEM and MCAC performed somewhat differently even in the simplest
cases  of  pure  agglomeration  of  either  monodisperse  primary  parti-
cles, especially in the free-molecular regime, or polydisperse primary
particles. In the cases of pure particle agglomeration MCAC typically
predicted faster particle coagulation and hence a faster decay in the
particle number concentration and a larger number of monomers per
agglomerate. Larger discrepancies in the results of EDEM and MCAC
were produced in the simulation of particle aggregation in the presence
of surface growth, which can be primarily attributed to the difference
in how they model surface growth of fractal aggregates formed by
overlapping primary particles discussed in Section 5. In fact, the surface
growth of fractal aggregates is handled differently in all three meso-
scale methods reviewed in this article. Apart from other differences
in the predicted particle morphology and aggregate size distribution,
a distinct consequence is the primary particle polydispersity. Specif-
ically, for initially monodisperse primary particles subject to surface
growth EDEM and DSPB will produce fractal soot aggregates formed by
polydisperse primary particles with overlapping. In contrast, MCAC will
produce soot fractal aggregates formed by overlapping monodisperse
primary particles. Therefore, how to properly model the surface growth
of  fractal  aggregates  formed  by  either  point-contact  or  overlapping
primary  particles  remains  a  challenge.  This  question  may  perhaps
be  answered  by  performing  a  detailed  DSMC  simulation  of  a  frac-
tal soot aggregate submerged in surface growth gaseous species and
calculating  soot  surface  growth  based  on  collision  between  surface
growth species and the soot particle without prescribing how mass is
added to the soot particle. It is noticed that benchmark meso-scale
solutions of nanoparticle aggregation in the presence of surface growth
are currently unavailable to our knowledge, but certainly needed for
validating meso-scale methods. It should also be noticed that EDEM and
MCAC modeled the mobility diameter of fractal aggregates differently.
While the Dm∕Dp ratio of MCAC depends on Dp, it is independent of Dp
in EDEM in both the free-molecular and transition flow regimes. The
mobility diameter of fractal aggregates in different flow regimes should
be further investigated.

As can be seen in Table  4, there is no agreement in the criteria
for selecting the initial primary particle size distribution considered
in DEM simulations for soot formation in flames. It is also currently
unknown  how  soot  primary  particle  polydispersity  arises  from  the
following three plausible reasons: (1) polydispersity of incipient soot
particles (as commonly considered in MCAC simulations [334]), (2) as
the result of continuous soot inception in time in the presence of surface
growth [163], or (3) as the result of surface growth itself (as proposed
in EDEM simulations [33]). It is possible that the soot primary particle
polydispersity is the dominant one among the three causes in reality,
though their relative importance may vary with flame conditions.

In addition to the challenges of detailed modeling of soot surface
growth discussed above at meso-scale, there are several other important
yet unresolved issues in modeling the detailed soot particle morphology
in sooting flames, such as coalescence, sintering, and maturity.

Coalescence refers to the process in which two colliding spherical
particles fuse into a larger spherical particle instantaneously, which
results in reduced particle number concentration and the available area
for surface growth. It is noticed that coalescence is commonly used to
describe the instantaneous merging of two liquid drops upon collision.
Coalescence has been believed to play an important role in the very
early stage of soot formation [21]. The current status of modeling soot
coalescence was reviewed in Section 3.1. More fundamental research is
clearly needed to understand the coalescence of incipient soot particles
and to explore how to differentiate incipient soot coalescence from PAH
coalescence. It is noticed that coalescence of liquid-like incipient soot
has not always been taken into account in soot models, either at meso-
or macro-scale. For example, particle coalescence was implemented
in the DSPB method in which a soot particle smaller than a critical

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 110 (2025) 101234

diameter coalesces with another particle upon collision [197,205]. Con-
tinuous coalescence of 2 nm soot [33] and silica [360] nanoparticles
has been simulated by EDEM. It was shown that coalescence and sur-
face growth of small nascent soot particles in the absence of aggregation
resulted in narrow size distributions and underestimated the measured
mean Dm of premixed flame soot by 25% [33]. Coalescence of soot has
not been considered in MCAC. Even though coalescence of flame-made
silica nanoparticles has been considered by EDEM [360], coalescence
of soot has not been considered in either EDEM or MCAC. The potential
importance of coalescence in the early growth of incipient soot particles
is strongly dependent on their coagulation efficiency. Quite different
coagulation efficiencies of incipient soot particles have been reported
in the literature as reviewed in Section 3.2.

Further studies are needed to reconcile the large differences in the
sticking probability of young soot particles less than 10 nm predicted
by Hou et al. [209], Morán et al. [206], and Hou et al. [214] on one
hand, and Huo et al. [202] on the other hand.

In the context of aerosol science, sintering commonly refers to the
process  of  compacting  and  bonding  of  two  or  more  touching  solid
particles by pressure or heat, causing the atoms of these particles in the
contacting region to diffuse across their surfaces to fuse into each other.
Different mechanisms of sintering have been proposed [403], such as
surface diffusion, grain boundary diffusion, and plastic/viscous flow.
Because  coalescence  and  sintering  describe  a  similar  phenomenon,
they are sometimes used inconsistently in the literature [30,98]. The
relevance of sintering in soot formation has been subject to confusion
and debate. On one hand, it is believed that carbonaceous soot particles
do not undergo sintering since they possess a turbostratic structure and
do not melt [32,158]. On the other hand, sintering has been considered
important in the studies of Kraft and co-workers, e.g. [98,194,197,205,
353]. It is worth noting that sintering and coalescence are modeled
the same way in these studies and the subtle difference between them
lies in the characteristic sintering time, i.e., sintering is a relatively
slow process (relative to coalescence) while coalescence takes place
nearly instantaneously [205]. Besides surface growth, sintering is po-
tentially another mechanism for the overlap between neighboring soot
primary particles in aggregates observed in TEM images of sampled
soot. Although Michelsen et al. [30] have recently recommended to
use  coalescence  to  describe  the  instantaneous  merging  of  liquid-like
incipient soot particles and favored the viewpoint that sintering is not
relevant to soot, the transition of incipient soot from coalescence to
aggregation growth deserves further research to ascertain if young soot
particles undergo sintering under different flame conditions. However,
sintering should be taken into account for the simulation of particles
composed of other materials at high temperatures, such as TiO2.

Soot maturity has received increasing research attention in recent
years because it is closely related to the chemical and physical prop-
erties of soot. Maturity has been used to describe the maturity level
of soot during its evolution from incipient soot to fully mature soot.
Conceptually, the maturity level of soot can be linked to its chemical
composition and/or its internal nanostructure, and different techniques
(most of these techniques are ex-situ) can be used to characterize the
chemical, morphological, and structural properties of soot particles,
depending  on  their  maturity  level  [404].  There  is  currently  no  es-
tablished indicator to quantify the level of soot maturity, though the
soot absorption function E(m) and the Ångstrom absorption exponent
(AAE) have often been used for this purpose [12–14,405]. This is likely
because E(m) and AAE can be obtained in-situ and fairly easily from
extinction measurements. Kholghy et al. [189] defined mature soot
by  the  presence  of  a  graphitic  shell,  regardless  of  H/C  ratio,  shell
thickness, or size. It has been well known that soot maturity affects the
surface reactivity of soot particles as discussed in Section 3; however,
little attention has been paid to the effect of soot maturity on soot
particle dynamics, i.e., the bulk density increase with maturity and
soot maturity as characterized by the soot particle surface structure
can potentially affect the collision and sticking efficiencies. Although

the DSPB model is able to track the average H/C ratio and the detailed
PAH composition of soot particles, carbonization, which is believed to
be the driving force of soot maturity, has not been considered in the
other two meso-scale methods discussed in this review.

Recently, Morán et al. [206] have made an attempt to investigate
the effect of soot maturity on soot particle aggregation kinetics. In
their study, however, soot maturity was related only to particle size
and bulk mass density, without accounting for detailed particle surface
structure characterized by PAH size and orientation [189]. The impact
of the particle bulk density and maturity on soot dynamics has also
been quantified in EDEM [360]. That way, it was shown that reducing
the bulk density from 1.8 to 1.4 g/cm3 did not affect the evolution of
the soot Dm and Dp.

As  can  be  seen  in  Table   4,  other  limitations  of  the  meso-scale
approaches include a detailed consideration of the local flame condi-
tions, such as temperature and gas species concentrations, as well as
modeling the particle-gas mass transfer. Also, as tracking the positions
of individual primary particles, as done in DEM meso-scale approaches,
is  commonly  computationally  expensive,  simulating  a  whole  flame
remains a challenge. An alternative to tackle these limitations has been
recently proposed in Ref. [163]. In this work, the authors proposed a
strategy for simulating soot formation in a diffusion flame based on
DEM simulations. For this purpose, they coupled both macro- and meso-
scale codes (CoFlame and MCAC). This multi-scale approach accounted
for the local flame conditions to predict the evolution of soot particle
size and morphology along specified pathlines in the flame as shown
in Fig.  37.

Indeed, both meso- and macro-scale modeling should be conducted
as they complement each other. Macro-scale methods provide a more
detailed  description  of  soot  kinetics  (chemical  aspects  dealing  with
interactions  with  gas-phase  species),  but  cannot  track  soot  particle
dynamics at the level of meso-scale methods. Specifically, macro-scale
methods are capable of providing soot inception, surface growth, and
oxidation rates and soot particle size distribution because they solve the
conservation equations of the system, including the gas-phase and the
particle phase, i.e., the focus of macro-scale methods is the statistical

54

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 110 (2025) 101234

behavior of the reacting system. However, macro-scale methods are
unable to describe certain particle behavior, especially for fractal-like
soot particles, such as the fractal parameters (Df  and kf ), collision
diameter, and mobility diameter. Such information has to be obtained
either from experiments or from meso-scale modeling. On the other
hand, the focus of meso-scale methods is the particle behavior, though
some gas-phase properties affecting the particle process are still needed,
such as temperature, viscosity, and mean-free-path. To model soot for-
mation in flames, meso-scale methods typically depend on macro-scale
methods to provide temperature, gas-phase species, and soot inception,
surface growth, and oxidation rates along the trajectory of the meso-
scale domain in the flame. Several studies have been conducted to
use a meso-scale method as a post-processor to provide more detailed
modeling of soot particle morphology [163,205]. From these points
of view, such multiscale modeling should be coupled in the future
to achieve overall better description of soot formation and particle
dynamics. Specifically, the detailed soot particle morphology from the
meso-scale modeling should be used to update the macro-scale model-
ing. This is because soot particle morphology affects not only particle
coagulation but also soot particle surface growth and oxidation through
surface area. In this regard, simple analytical power laws for the soot
collision frequency [350,360], Dm and Dg [94] derived by EDEM have
been interfaced with macro-scale population balance models to account
for the realistic soot structure, improving substantially their agreement
with experimental data [243,297]. Nevertheless, with the perspective
of coupling simulations at meso- and macro-scales, an effort must be
made to improve the modeling of certain forces. Indeed, simulating
aggregation in a domain (meso-scale) moving along a streamline in the
macro-scale simulation is not enough. While it has been shown that
molecular diffusion plays a negligible role due to short residence times,
the thermophoretic force seems to play a non-negligible role in the
extraction of the domain trajectory [163]. In fact, it has been shown
that in identical temperature gradients, at the same mobility diameter,
the thermophoretic velocity of aggregates is much higher than that of
a spherical particle [406].

Another remaining challenge is adapting DEM codes for turbulent
flames. Although the length scales studied in meso-scale simulations
are  much  smaller  than  the  smallest  turbulent  scales.  However,  the
time scale involved in particle coagulation in meso-scale simulations
(on the order of ms to s) is much longer than turbulent time scales
(typically on the order of μs). Consequently, turbulent effects cannot
be ignored during meso-scale modeling of soot particle aggregation. A
remarkable pioneer work has been conducted by Inci et al. [345] where
Langevin Dynamics DEM simulations have been combined with a DNS
approach to account for the flame turbulence. The authors highlight
the importance of determining the Péclet number corresponding to the
ratio between the Brownian diffusion and Kolmogorov characteristic
times.  They  tend  to  observe  an  increase  in  the  population  fractal
dimension as the Péclet increases from Df p ≈ 1.65 for pure diffusive
aggregation to 1.91 ≤ Df p
≤ 2.1 for Péclet numbers as high as 1. In ad-
dition, DEM and DNS simulations have shown that the collision rate of
droplets growing by turbulent coalescence is smaller compared to that
obtained by kinetic theory valid for laminar conditions [407]. There is
a limited understanding though about the impact of turbulence on soot
agglomeration during combustion. In this regard, the soot mobility and
primary particle size distributions measured in a rather turbulent flame
environment in an enclosed spray combustion burner were described
accurately by EDEM for surface growth and agglomeration [361]. This
may indicate that the impact of turbulence is rather small for soot
formation during combustion. Further research is certainly essential to
explore the effects of turbulence on soot dynamics.

Much effort needs to be made to access experimentally in a non-
intrusive in-situ manner to the measurands of interest for the simulation
discussed in this review. Indeed, DEM simulation provides access to
detailed information on the size and morphology of soot. In order to
ensure the relevance of this modeling, it is appropriate to validate them

F. Liu et al.

on reference flames. To date, while reference flames are fairly well
detailed in terms of soot volume fraction, few studies reported informa-
tion on their size and even fewer presented detailed soot morphology
(generally limited to Df p and Dp). Therefore, efforts need to be made to
better determine experimentally the size and morphology of particles
with  the  best  possible  spatial  and  temporal  resolution.  Techniques
based on light scattering (visible or X-ray) have great potential in this
perspective. For example, a very recent study has improved an angular
light scattering technique for determining the size of aggregates in
an axisymmetric scattering flame with high spatial resolution and by
correcting the bias induced by light trapping occurring in such heavily
sooting flames [408]. With such advanced experimental techniques,
we hope to be able to validate the simulations and also to gain more
clarity on certain pending questions such as those raised in this review
concerning the nature of the size distribution during particle formation
(lognormal or self-preserving) and if sintering plays a role in primary
particle overlap.

8. Concluding remarks

Developing capabilities of predicting the detailed soot particle size
and morphology is of both great fundamental interest and vital im-
portance to optimization of carbon black furnace design, evaluation
of  soot  particle  physical  and  optical  properties,  and  mitigation  of
soot emissions from combustion systems. Although the details of soot
formation, such as inception, maturity, surface growth, and oxidation-
induced fragmentation, remain not fully resolved, significant progress
has been achieved in our understanding of PAH formation and growth
of PAH clusters leading to incipient soot under flame conditions from
experiments and multi-scale modeling. Reactive molecular dynamics
simulations and meso-scale discrete element methods have been in-
creasingly  used  to  investigate  soot  inception  and  particle  dynamics
and the evolution of particle size distribution and detailed morphology
of individual soot particles. Macro-scale models of soot formation in
flames, either solve the PBE explicitly or implicitly using the sectional
soot kinetics models, have also been advanced to the level that the soot
volume fraction, particle size distribution, and mean primary particle
size  in  laminar  flames  can  be  predicted  reasonably  well  compared
to experimental data. In this review, we discussed various physical
and chemical processes that play an important role in the growth of
mass and size of soot particle after inception. The subjects reviewed
in this article include the properties of fractal-like soot agglomerates,
the physics of particle agglomeration, coalescence, mechanisms and
modeling of particle surface growth, the three commonly used state-of-
the-art meso-scale (namely, the Event-driven Discrete Element Method,
Monte  Carlo  Aggregation  Code,  and  Detailed  Stochastic  Population
Balance) approaches to model the details of individual soot particle
morphology  without  and  with  the  presence  of  surface  growth,  and
the commonly used macro-scale sectional method and the methods of
moments for modeling particle dynamics and the sectional soot kinetics
models. The focus of this review was on how particle aggregation and
surface growth were modeled in the meso-scale methods.

With adequately assumed particle morphological parameters, namely
the fractal dimension and fractal prefactor, the macro-scale sectional
method  and  the  methods  of  moments  provide  reasonably  accurate
results of particle agglomeration, especially the sectional method, in
comparison with the meso-scale approaches. Despite the inability to
predict the particle morphology, the macro-scale PBE methods offer
high computational efficiency, in particular the methods of moments,
and can be used to model particle dynamics in a fully coupled manner
with  mass,  momentum,  energy,  species,  and  soot  related  transport
equations.

Meso-scale methods are a powerful tool for modeling the evolution
of a particle system containing initially a relatively large number of
isolated spherical primary particles under agglomeration without or

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 110 (2025) 101234

with surface growth. Unlike the macro-scale methods that require as-
sumed particle morphological parameters to estimate particle collision
rate, meso-scale approaches track the positions of primary particles and
hence are able to predict the morphology of individual soot particles.
Owing to the complex shape of fractal-like soot aggregates, however,
different models of soot particle mobility diameter have been imple-
mented in the three meso-scale approaches reviewed in this paper.
One of our main motivations for this review was to understand the
quite different levels of primary particle polydispersity under similar
flame conditions predicted by the event-driven discrete element method
(EDEM) and the Monte-Carlo aggregation code (MCAC) in previous
publications. To this end, all the models implemented in EDEM and
MCAC  have  been  comprehensively  reviewed  and  their  results  were
directly compared in three test cases: two pure agglomeration cases (no
surface growth) of different initial primary particle sizes and one case
with surface growth of different initial particle volume fractions. To
better focus on the impact of different implementations of particle ag-
glomeration kinetics and surface growth, soot oxidation was excluded
from this exercise.

EDEM and MCAC predicted different soot particle agglomeration
kinetics even for the pure agglomeration cases, especially for the case
where the flow is in the near-transition regime. The difference can be
mainly attributed to the different particle mobility models used. For
the test with surface growth, EDEM and MCAC predicted a similar
evolution of the soot volume fraction, particle morphology, and mean
aggregate size. However, EDEM predicted significantly broader primary
particle size distributions than MCAC. In cases of extensive surface
growth (for example in a CB furnace), the aggregate size distribution
obtained by EDEM is also broader than the MCAC one. The different
behavior of EDEM and MCAC in the presence of surface growth is
primarily caused by the different ways to implement surface growth.
In MCAC, the evolution of primary particle polydispersity is entirely
dependent on the initial primary particle polydispersity and surface
growth does not qualitatively alter it. In contrast, EDEM always predicts
polydisperse  primary  particles  when  there  is  surface  growth,  even
when initially the primary particles are monodisperse. In this regard,
it is expected that the detailed stochastic population balance (DSPB)
method performs similarly to EDEM since they handle soot surface
growth in a similar way.

Despite different implementations of fractal aggregate dynamics and
surface growth, meso-scale simulations have advanced our quantitative
understanding  of  soot  particle  dynamics  and  the  evolution  of  soot
particle size and morphology in laminar flames and also help develop
accurate correlations required in macro-scale modeling.

However, meso-scale methods are computationally expensive and
can currently only be used to predict detailed soot particle size distri-
bution and morphology in a decoupled fashion. Although meso-scale
approaches can predict more realistic morphologies of individual soot
particles revealed from TEM images and even if enormous progress has
been made since the first models of the aggregate formation, i.e., DLCA
and  BLCA,  significant  challenges  remain  to  establish  a  benchmark
solution to particle agglomeration in the presence of surface growth
and to incorporate soot maturity characterized by carbonization and
oxidation-induced fragmentation.

The impact of turbulence on soot dynamics, especially at meso-
scales, should be explored further. There is limited understanding about
the impact of turbulence on soot agglomeration during combustion.
Limited  research  suggests  that  turbulence  appears  to  have  a  fairly
weak impact on soot formation during combustion, but this conclusion
should be verified.

As a summary, the limitations and capabilities of the macro- and

meso-scale methods reviewed are highlighted in Table  6.

Although significant progress has been made in both macro- and
meso-scale modeling of soot formation, several challenges remain as
outlined above, such as sintering, modeling surface growth at meso-
scale, coupling of meso- and macro-scale modeling, and modeling the

continue to play a vital role in resolving these remaining challenges,
in the development of more capable and more accurate soot models, in
the design of more efficient and cleaner combustion devices, and in the
optimization of carbon black furnaces.
