The development of biofuels has been considered as an important countermeasure to abate anthro- 
pogenic CO 2 emissions, suppress deteriorated atmospheric greenhouse effect, and mitigate global warm- 
ing. To produce biofuels from biomass, thermochemical conversion processes are considered as the most 
eﬃcient routes wherein torrefaction has the lowest global warming potential. Combustion is the easiest 
way to consume biomass, which can be burned alone or co-ﬁred with coal to generate heat and power. 
However, solid biomass fuels are not commonly applied in the industry due to their characteristics of 
hygroscopic nature and high moisture content, low bulk density and caloriﬁc value, poor grindability, 
low compositional homogeneity, and lower resistance against biological degradation. In recently devel- 
oping biomass conversion technologies, torrefaction has attracted much attention since it can effectively 
upgrade solid biomass and produce coal-like fuel. Torrefaction is categorized into dry and wet torrefac- 
tion; the former can further be split into non-oxidative and oxidative torrefaction. Despite numerous 
methods developed, non-oxidative torrefaction, normally termed torrefaction, has a higher potential for 
practical applications and commercialization when compared to other methods. To provide a comprehen- 
sive review of the progress in biomass torrefaction technologies, this study aims to perform an in-depth 
literature survey of torrefaction principles, processes, systems, and to identify a current trend in practi- 
cal torrefaction development and environmental performance. Moreover, the encountered challenges and

perspectives from torrefaction development are underlined. This state-of-the-art review is conducive to 
the production and applications of biochar for resource utilization and environmental sustainability. To 
date, several kinds of reactors have been developed, while there is still no obviously preferred one as 
they simultaneously have pros and cons. Integrating torrefaction with other processes such as co-ﬁring, 
gasiﬁcation, pyrolysis, and ironmaking, etc., makes it more eﬃcient and economically feasible in contrast 
to using a single process. By virtue of capturing carbon dioxide during the growth stage of biomass, neg- 
ative carbon emissions can even be achieved from torreﬁed biomass.

1. Introduction 

The development of renewable energy is considered as an im- 
perative and essential countermeasure for resource and environ- 
ment sustainability. Among developing renewable energy technolo- 
gies, bioenergy has received more attention than other renewable 
energy  resources  such  as  solar  energy,  wind  energy,  geothermal 
energy, marine energy, and hydropower [1] . In recent years, there 
is a rapid growth in the installations of solar cells and wind tur- 
bines  [ 2 , 3 ].  However,  CO 
2  emissions  continuously  rise  while  the 
atmospheric CO 
2 concentration is higher than 410 ppm exceeding 
the safe global limits [4] . This implies that the anthropogenic ac- 
tivity from fossil fuel combustion still plays an important role in 
energy consumption, even though many efforts have been made in 
power generation from solar and wind energy. 

Nowadays,  bioenergy  is  the  fourth  largest  primary  energy 
source which is preceded by oil, coal, and natural gas [5] . Unlike 
solar and wind energy which are used solely for electricity gen- 
eration, the development of bioenergy is mainly to produce biofu- 
els that can be applied to heat and power generation as well as 
in the transportation sector. Biofuels are generated from the con- 
version  of  biomass  which  is  produced  from  carbon  dioxide  and 
water through photosynthesis. From the viewpoint of energy stor- 
age, photosynthesis is regarded as a global process to synthesize 
biomass in which solar energy is stored. 

Over  the  last  several  decades,  biofuels  based  on  biomass 
sources have evolved from ﬁrst-generation biofuels produced from 
food  crops,  second-generation  biofuels  produced  from  inedible 
lignocellulosic  biomass,  third-generation  biofuels  produced  from 
algal  (macroalgal  and  microalgal)  biomass,  and  then  to  fourth- 
generation biofuels through genetically engineered algal and mi- 
crobial systems [5-7] . Biomass can be burned directly to generate 
heat  and  power.  However,  to  extend  its  utility  in  industrial  and 
other sectors, a variety of conversion technologies have been de- 
veloped.  As  a  whole,  these  technologies  are  categorized  into  (1) 
physical, (2) chemical, (3) biological, and (4) thermochemical con- 
version  processes  [8] .  Biomass  drying,  separation,  pulverization, 
and  pelletization  pertain  to  physical  conversion.  One  of  the  no- 
table  chemical  conversion  is  biodiesel  production  through  trans- 
esteriﬁcation. Biogas, biohydrogen, bioethanol, and biobutanol pro- 
duction can be fulﬁlled through fermentation, sacchariﬁcation, or 
photosynthesis which are classiﬁed as biological conversion. Ther- 
mochemical  conversion  is  a  remarkable  and  the  most  important 
pathway for biofuel production, except for combustion where heat 
is the main product. The beneﬁts of the thermochemical process 
are numerous: small footprint, eﬃcient nutrient recovery, short re- 
action time, and the capability of handling a variety of wastes and 
blends, among others. 

As far as solid fuels are concerned, coal has been widely em- 
ployed in the industry because of its accessibility, low cost, stable 
supply,  and  high  energy  density  [9] .  However,  the  massive  con- 
sumption of coal has given rise to several environmental problems 
such as local air and thermal pollution, regional acid rain, globally 
deteriorating atmospheric greenhouse effect, global warming, and 
climate change [10] . Compared to coal, biomass has several advan- 
tages as follows. 

Biomass is an abundant energy resource that covers a large por- 
tion of land areas on the Earth’s surface and has a short life cycle. 
Therefore, biomass is a potential candidate as an alternative fuel to

turn, that bioenergy is a stable backup energy resource. 

The  main  growth-dependent  carbon  source  for  cells  is  atmo- 
spheric carbon dioxide, so biomass is usually noticed as a carbon- 
neutral fuel precursor. Moreover, biomass usually has lower sulfur 
and nitrogen contents compared to coal. This implies, in turn, that 
CO 
2 emissions during biomass burning processes are more recov- 
erable, along with fewer emissions of SO x and NO x [11] . Neverthe- 
less, in the course of biofuel production, the carbon footprint in 
the chain of growing, harvesting, storing, transporting, and apply- 
ing biomass should be considered. 

However, solid biomass fuels are characterized by hygroscopic 
nature  and  high  moisture  content,  low  bulk  density  and  energy 
density  (or  caloriﬁc  value),  poor  grindability,  low  compositional 
homogeneity, and lower resistance against biological degradation 
and thereby storability [5] . Therefore, solid biomass is not a pop- 
ular  fuel  for  its  application  in  industry.  To  overcome  the  afore- 
mentioned disadvantages, the development of torrefaction has re- 
ceived  a  great  deal  of  attention  in  the  last  decade  inasmuch  as 
this thermochemical conversion technology can effectively upgrade 
biomass and improve solid biomass-derived fuel (biochar) quality. 
The  applications  of  torrefaction  and  upgraded  biomass  have 
been discussed in some papers [ 5 , 12–15 ]. However, the informa- 
tion  on  system  integration  and  practical  applications  of  biomass 
torrefaction in the industry remains insuﬃcient. To provide a com- 
prehensive review of the progress of torrefaction technology, the 
fundamentals of torrefaction are ﬁrst introduced in this paper. This 
work highlights the treatment of biomass to enhance its material 
properties through a thorough discussion of the torrefaction pro- 
cess from operations, process parameters, reaction systems, com- 
mercialization, and environmental impacts. This study also aims to 
deepen the understanding of the torrefaction process towards com- 
mercialization  and  identify  future  research  directions.  A  current 
trend  in  the  development  of  torrefaction  from  academic  studies 
and the up-to-date practical research from the viewpoint of patent 
strategy is then presented. Special attention is given to the system 
integration of biomass torrefaction in which the main components 
consist of feedstock, pretreatment, reactor, and post-treatment. The 
types of feedstock such as lignocelluloses, algal biomass, fermented 
residues, and wastes for torrefaction are introduced [ 16 , 17 ], while 
their pretreatments such as drying, pelletization, catalyst impreg- 
nation,  and  leaching  are  discussed.  The  reactor  is  a  key  facility 
to  perform  torrefaction  in  a  system.  A  variety  of  reported  and 
patented  reactors  and  their  characteristics  are  illustrated.  As  for 
the post-treatment, cooling, grinding, and/or pelletization are de- 
scribed.  The  mass  and  energy  balances  of  a  torrefaction  system 
are  also  analyzed.  Thereafter,  potential  applications  of  upgraded 
biomass (e.g., combustion, gasiﬁcation, pyrolysis, ironmaking, and 
bio-adsorbent), current commercialization status, and cost analy- 
sis of torrefaction are addressed. Also, the carbon footprint and life 
cycle assessment of torrefaction processes are evaluated to quan- 
tify the impact of torrefaction upon the environment. Eventually, 
the challenges and perspectives of biomass torrefaction technolo- 
gies are outlined to bridge the gap between the lacked knowledge 
in past review papers and future research.

tion, carbonization, and torrefaction [ 5 , 18 ]. The operations of these 
methods  depend  on  oxygen  supply  and  reaction  temperature, 
while solid, liquid, and gas biofuels are produced from these meth- 
ods, except for combustion. The operating conditions of the afore- 
mentioned  thermochemical  conversion  methods  and  their  main 
products are summarized in Fig. 1 . 

The combustion of biomass, with suﬃcient oxygen or oxidant 
supply, possesses the merits of direct and easy operation as well 
as mature technique. Combustion technology has been applied in 
human lives such as heating and cooking for a long period. Com- 
bustion also played a key role in the Industrial Revolution to gen- 
erate power through steam, and it is still a prominent factor for 
power generation at present. Almost all biomass materials can be 
applied in combustion as long as their caloriﬁc values are suﬃ- 
ciently high which can reduce the reliance on fossil fuels. Biomass 
burned alone or co-ﬁred with coal has been applied for a long time 
[19] .  Heat,  rather  than  biofuels,  is  the  main  product  from  burn- 
ing biomass where the operating temperature is normally between 
750 °C and 1500 °C depending on feedstock, reactor, and combus- 
tion technology [19–21] . 

When biomass is burned in an environment with insuﬃcient or 
starved oxygen supply, gaseous fuels or product gases are gener- 
ated from the incomplete combustion of feedstock. Hydrogen (H 
2 ) 
and  carbon  monoxide  (CO)  are  two  main  products  in  the  prod- 
uct gases, and both are spoken of as synthesis gas or syngas. In 
2 )  and 
the  product  gases,  certain  amounts  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO 
methane  (CH 
2 , 
NH 
3 , and HCN, also exist [ 22 , 23 ]. The gasiﬁcation temperature is 
generally between 600 °C and 1200 °C [24] . The gasiﬁcation can be 
classiﬁed into conventional, steam, and supercritical water gasiﬁca- 
tion [25] , depending on the reaction environment. The comparison 
of the three gasiﬁcation technologies is summarized in Table 1 .

Instead of gaining gaseous biofuels, liquid biofuels are the main 
products from pyrolysis and liquefaction. In pyrolysis and liquefac- 
tion, the chemical reactions are triggered in an inert or oxygen- 
free environment. On account of no oxygen supplied, bonds in hy- 
drocarbons in biomass are thermally broken and liquid bio-oils are 
obtained. In general, biomass pyrolysis is conducted at tempera- 
tures between 400 °C and 800 °C, and can be categorized into fast 
pyrolysis, slow pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, and microwave pyrol- 
ysis where the ﬁxed bed and ﬂuidized bed reactors can be used 
[ 5 , 26 ].  The  comparison  of  the  four  pyrolysis  technologies  is  also 
listed in Table 1 . Liquefaction, also known as thermochemical liq- 
uefaction or hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), is a thermal process 
at a temperature range of 20 0-60 0 °C to convert biomass into a liq-

uid biofuel called bio-oil or biocrude. Unlike pyrolysis where the 
thermal degradation normally proceeds at the atmospheric pres- 
sure  and  vapors  (including  permanent  gases  and  condensed  liq- 
uids) are formed, the pressure in liquefaction (10-25 MPa) is high 
[18] to keep solvents such as water, acetone, or ethanol in the liq- 
uid phase [27] . This facilitates the chemical reactions for the feed- 
stock in the liquid solutions.

catalysts (i.e., MgO, CaO, ZnO) are widely used in catalytic pyrolysis [43] . 

Carbonization and torrefaction are practiced in an environment 
in the absence of oxygen, resembling pyrolysis, and liquefaction; 
however,  they  aim  to  produce  solid  fuels  such  as  charcoke  or 
biochar. In slow pyrolysis, the biochar (or solid char) yield is high, 
resulting from the slow heating rate and long residence time. In 
earlier literature, pyrolysis generally equates carbonization [ 28 , 29 ] 
where  the  reaction  temperature  ranges  from  400 °C  to  10 0 0 °C. 
Charcoal produced from biomass carbonization can be applied in 
combustion as a solid fuel, in gasiﬁcation as a feedstock, and in 
the metallurgical process as a reducing agent [30] . As for torrefac- 
tion,  biomass  is  mildly  pyrolyzed  at  temperatures  of  20 0-30 0 °C. 
The main target of torrefaction is to upgrade solid biomass as an 
alternative to coal. 

2.2. Thermal degradation characteristics of biomass 

Thermogravimetric analyzer (TG) is considered as a useful tech- 
nique  to  access  the  thermal  behavior  and  decomposition  kinet- 
ics of biomass. Thermogravimetric analysis and derivative thermo- 
gravimetric  (TGA  &  DTG)  curves  of  bamboo  ( Phyllostachys  maki- 
noi ) in nitrogen at a temperature range of 25-800 °C are depicted 
in Fig. 2 a . In examining the TGA curve, overall, the weight distri- 
bution of the biomass with increasing temperature can be parti- 
tioned into ﬁve different zones (i.e., Zones I, II, III, IV, and V). When 
the temperature is between 25 °C and 100 °C (Zone I), moisture or 
free-water in the biomass is vaporized and the drying process is 
carried  out  [45] .  For  the  temperature  between  100 °C  and  200 °C 
(Zone II), the weight loss of the biomass is fairly slight (around 1 
wt%). It follows that this zone is characterized by nearly chemi- 
cally frozen. When the temperature is in the range of 20 0-30 0 °C 
(Zone III), the thermal degradation of the biomass becomes obvi- 
ous and the weight loss is 19 wt%. This signiﬁcant weight loss is 
due to the biomass thermal degradation and devolatilization pro- 
cesses [46] in which a part of volatile matter (VM) in the bamboo 
is liberated. When the bamboo is heated at temperatures ranging 
from 300 to 500 °C (Zone IV), the weight loss is 48 wt% and the 
weight of the biomass at 500 °C is 27 wt%, revealing the most se- 
vere thermal degradation occurring in this zone. In other words, 
most of the VM is released and ﬁxed carbon (FC) is retained in the 
solid residue. After the temperature is higher than 500 °C (Zone V), 
the weight loss of the biomass with increasing temperature slows 
down. For example, when the temperature increases from 500 to 

800 °C, only 9% of the weight is lost from the heating. The low DTG 
curve corresponds to a continuous and slow loss of carbonaceous 
matters [47] . 

The  TGA  and  DTG  curves  of  Camellia  japonica ,  an  abundant 
wood in Taiwan, are shown in Fig. 2 b. As a whole, the pyrolysis 
processes can also be characterized by a ﬁve-zone thermal degra- 
dation. The TGA curve in Zones I and II are stable, which are simi- 
lar to those of bamboo. It indicates that the lignocellulosic biomass 
has insigniﬁcant thermal degradation before 200 °C. The decompo- 
sition of Camellia japonica mainly takes place in Zones III and IV, 
approximately at temperatures of 230-410 °C. The peak exhibited in 
Zones III and IV results from the thermal degradation of hemicellu- 
loses and cellulose. The tail region of Zone IV and Zone V account 
for the degradation of lignin in the biomass. 

The TGA and DTG curves of a microalga ( Chlamydomonas sp. JSC 
4) thermally degraded in nitrogen are shown in Fig. 2 c. The weight 
loss characteristics of the microalga in Zones I and II are similar to 
those of bamboo. However, in Zone III (i.e., 20 0-30 0 °C), the ther- 
mal degradation of the microalga becomes pronounced when com- 
pared to that of bamboo, stemming from the inherent difference in 
components between lignocellulosic biomass (i.e., cellulose, hemi- 
celluloses, and lignin) and microalgal biomass (i.e., carbohydrates, 
proteins, and lipids) [ 4 8 , 4 9 ]. The weight losses of the microalga in 
Zones III and IV are 31 wt% and 31 wt%, respectively, showing the 
comparable devolatilization  extents  in  the  two  zones.  The  peaks 
in Zones III and IV are mainly ascribed to the thermal degrada- 
tion of polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids in the microalga, which 
had been identiﬁed in other studies by thermogravimetry-Fourier 
transform infrared spectrometer (TG-FTIR) and pyrolysis gas chro- 
matography mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) [ 50 , 51 ]. When the mi- 
croalgal biomass is heated in Zone V, its thermal degradation is not 
pronounced, as a consequence of continuous and slow decomposi- 
tion of carbonaceous matters [52] or the secondary cracking and 
methanation of bio-oil [51] , which cause 6% weight loss, resem- 
bling that of bamboo. 

According to the TGA and DTG curves observed in Fig. 2 , it is 
can be concluded that the thermal degradation mechanism of lig- 
nocellulosic  biomass  proceeds  from  drying  or  dehydration  (Zone 
I), nearly chemically frozen (Zone II), mild pyrolysis (Zone III), se- 
vere pyrolysis (Zone IV), and then to carbonization (Zone V). But 
for the microalgal biomass, its thermal degradation characteristics

in Zones III and IV are in a comparable state. The weight loss val- 
ues  of  the  three  biomass  species  in  each  zone  are  tabulated  in 
Table 2 . When the bamboo, Camellia japonica , and microalga are 
heated to 300 °C, their total weight losses are 25 wt%, 15 wt%, and 
41 wt%, respectively. Meanwhile, in the mild pyrolysis zone (Zone 
III), the weight loss values of the bamboo, Camellia japonica , and 
microalga are 19 wt%, 9%, and 31 wt%, respectively. These results 
reveal that volatiles in the biomass are liberated to a certain ex- 
tent in the mild pyrolysis zone (Zone III). Nevertheless, for bamboo 
and Camellia japonica , around 75 wt% of solid residues remain af- 
ter this heating process. Accordingly, the mild pyrolysis zone plays 
an important role in changing biomass properties from the thermal 
pretreatment. This motivates upgrading biomass using torrefaction 
(mild pyrolysis). 

3. Torrefaction 

3.1. Preliminary studies 

As  described  earlier,  solid  biomass  fuels  possess  several  dis- 
advantages so that their applications in the industry are limited 
[5] . In the last decade, the torrefaction has been widely developed 
since  this  technology  can  effectively  promote  the  fuel  quality  of 
carbon-neutral solid. A survey of the journal paper number in Web 
of Science (Sciencedirect.com) made on January 19, 2020, using the 
keyword of “torrefaction” based on the Abstract, Title, Keywords, 
suggested  more  than  1623  papers  had  been  published.  Torrefac- 
tion and similar technologies such as roasting have been widely 
employed for wood treatment [ 53 , 54 ], coffee bean production [55] , 
and enhancing the ﬂavor and improving organoleptic properties of 
food [56] . 

Upon  examining  the  articles,  similar  research  focus  can  be 
observed  such  as  torrefaction  effects  on  biomass  properties,  en- 
ergy  densiﬁcation,  and  solid  and  energy  yields,  followed  by  ad- 
dressing  the  industrial,  environmental,  and  agricultural  applica- 
tions of torreﬁed biomass such as combustion, ironmaking, pyroly- 
sis, liquefaction, gasiﬁcation, pollutant adsorption, and soil amend- 
ment [ 5 , 14 , 15 , 57 , 58 ]. Lately, more studies investigated the reaction 
mechanisms  of  torrefaction  and  the  inﬂuence  on  biomass  struc- 
tures [59–62] . In addition, several studies attempted to understand 
biomass thermal degradation behaviors by conducting torrefaction 
kinetics [63–66] . 

3.2. Classiﬁcation 

The purpose of the torrefaction process is to upgrade biomass 
and  produce  solid  fuels  with  better  quality.  To  fulﬁll  this  goal, 
biomass is torreﬁed under dry or wet conditions, which are termed 
dry torrefaction and wet torrefaction, respectively. In dry torrefac- 
tion, biomass can be torreﬁed in dry and non-oxidative (inert) or 
oxidative atmospheres where the temperature is normally between 
20 0 °C and 30 0 °C. In contrast, in wet torrefaction, biomass is up- 
graded by water and dilute acid solutions at temperatures of 180- 
260 °C. In addition to the aforementioned two methods, biomass 

Fig. 3.  Classiﬁcation of torrefaction 

can also be treated by steam to improve its properties. The classi- 
ﬁcation of torrefaction methods is shown in Fig. 3 . 

3.2.1. Dry torrefaction 

In  non-oxidative  torrefaction,  nitrogen  [59]  and  carbon diox- 
ide  [67]  have  been  used  as  carrier  gases,  and  the  former  is  the 
most  commonly  utilized  carrier  gas  to  sweep  biomass  materials 
when they are thermally pretreated. As for oxidative torrefaction, 
attempts have been made using air [68] , ﬂue gas [69] , and other 
gases containing different oxygen concentrations [ 70 , 71 ] as carrier 
gases to pretreat biomass. Owing to the presence of oxygen and 
exothermic reactions occurred in the thermal degradation, oxida- 
tive torrefaction has a higher reaction rate than that of the non- 
oxidative torrefaction [68] , thereby shortening the torrefaction du- 
ration. Using air or ﬂue gas to torrefy biomass can reduce operat- 
ing costs because nitrogen separation from the air is not required. 
Fuel  properties  of  biomass  torreﬁed  by  a  sweep  gas  along  with 
low oxygen concentrations ( < 6 vol%) are close to those torreﬁed 
by  nitrogen  [71] .  However,  oxidative  torrefaction  obtains  lower 
solid yield compared to the non-oxidative torrefaction [70–73] . It 
was also found that the higher heating value (HHV) of torreﬁed 
biomass decreases with increasing oxygen concentration when tor- 
reﬁed under the temperature of 300 °C, [72] . The comparison of ox- 
idative and non-oxidative torrefaction is highlighted and tabulated 
in Table 3 . 

3.2.2. Wet torrefaction 

Instead  of  biomass  upgraded  in  dry  mediums,  it  can  also  be 
pretreated  in  wet  mediums  such  as  water  and  dilute  acid  to 
achieve biomass upgrading, and the produced solid is called “hy- 
drochar”.  For  biomass  torreﬁed  in  hot  compressed  water  or  hy- 
drothermal media, it has been addressed that no signiﬁcant reac- 
tion of biomass occurred in liquid water when the temperature is 
below 180 °C [74] . Consequently, wet torrefaction is normally oper- 
ated under a reaction temperature between 180 °C and 260 °C with 
reaction time ranging from 5 to 240 min [66–68] . With increasing 
the temperature of the water, its properties would change dramat- 
ically, including dielectric constant, ion products, density, viscosity, 
and diffusivity [75] . These changes are conducive to biomass degra- 
dation under the liquid or aqueous phase. Therefore, wet torrefac- 
tion is usually operated under conditions close to the subcritical

state. Besides, adding sulfuric acid [76] , acetic acid [74] , and other 
materials such as lithium chloride into the liquid water [74] had 
been performed to enhance wet torrefaction performance. When 
biomass is degraded in hot compressed water, some volatile acids 
are  released  into  the  solution  [77] ,  which  further  enhances  the 
torrefaction process. For instance, when the treating temperature 
rises to 180 °C, aldehydes and furfural derivatives would be formed 
as  primary  precursors  for  the  formation  of  humins,  resulting  in 
the  increment  of  solid  products  [78] .  Recognizing  that  wet  tor- 
refaction treats biomass in a wet environment, no pre-drying pro- 
cess is required, implying that sludge, sewage, manure, and other 
wet biomass can be adopted as the feedstock in wet torrefaction 
[79] . The wet torrefaction process is similar to the dilute acid pre- 
treatment  [ 17 , 80 , 81 ];  therefore,  xylose  and  glucose  are  likely  to 
be  produced  and  contained  in  liquid  products  that  can  be  used 
for bioethanol production. Moreover, the degradation process pro- 
ceeding in the liquid phase along with high pressure can accom- 
plish  the  same  improvement  in  the  caloriﬁc  value  of  fuels  with 
dry torrefaction under much lower temperatures [76] . It also indi- 
cates that, compared to dry torrefaction, wet torrefaction can ob- 
tain higher energy densiﬁcation with similar mass yield  [82] .  In 
the view of energy consumption, wet torrefaction does not require 
pre-drying, so it is more energy-saving in sampling compared to 
dry torrefaction. However, it is opposite in harvesting product pro- 
cesses, indicating that they have trade-off on energy consumption. 
Another pronounced difference between dry and wet torrefac- 
tions is ash content in the upgraded biomass. Ash is considered as 
inert material in the course of dry torrefaction so that the ash con- 
tent of the product would increase proportionally after torrefac- 
tion. However, the ash content in biomass is reduced if it is pre- 
treated via wet torrefaction [ 83 , 84 ]. This is attributed to the disso- 
lution of minerals in ash into the aqueous phase. The reduced ash 
content can prevent possible problems such as agglomeration, de- 
position, corrosion, fouling, and slagging [84] caused in hydrochar 
conversion processes. 

3.2.3. Steam torrefaction 

Aside from dry and wet torrefactions, steam torrefaction is also 
a  torrefaction  process  using  high-temperature  and  high-pressure 
steam explosion to torrefy the biomass [85] . The steam explosion 
was initially employed to produce bioethanol [86] . The process in- 
troduces high-pressure and high-temperature steam into a sealed 
chamber placing lignocellulosic feedstock and is usually conducted 
at temperatures of 200-260 °C and a holding time of 5-10 min. The 
pressure is subsequently rapidly released which will cause steam 
to swell the lignocellulosic matrix and separate individual ﬁbers 
along  with  slight  loss  of  feedstock  [87] .  Low  molecular  weight 
volatiles in biomass are removed during the steam explosion, in- 
creasing  the  caloriﬁc  value  and  carbon  content  of  the  product, 
and  decreasing  its  mean  particle  size,  bulk  density,  and  equilib- 
rium moisture content (EMC) [88–90] . In recent works, the stud- 
ies of the steam torrefaction mainly concentrated on the charac- 
teristics of resultant solid products for manufacturing pellets [88–
91] . The steam torrefaction also has the merits of enabling to in- 

crease  the  caloriﬁc  value,  carbon  content,  and  hydrophobicity  at 
much  lower  temperatures  and  shorter  treatment  durations  com- 
pared to dry torrefaction. Besides, the pellets derived from steam 
explosion treatment have elasticity and higher mechanical strength 
than  those  of  the  untreated  pellets  [88] .  However,  compared  to 
pellets made from untreated biomass, the higher energy demand 
is required to make pellets from steam torrefaction, and more en- 
ergy is required to push pellets out of the die [92] . The comparison 
between dry, wet, and steam torrefaction, including operating con- 
ditions as well as advantages and disadvantages, is summarized in 
Table 4 . 

3.3. Biomass constituents 

3.3.1. Plant cell wall 

Plant  cell  walls  play  an  important  role  in  defending  against 
pathogens  and  insects  to  ensure  the  structural  integrity  of  the 
plant. The structure, composition, and conﬁguration of cell walls 
depend on cell type, cell wall layer, age, plant taxa, and tissue [93] . 
In general, plant cell walls can be split into three layers: (1) middle 
lamella; (2) primary cell wall; and (3) secondary cell wall. Hemi- 
celluloses, cellulose, and lignin have different proportions and dis- 
tributions in these layers. The schematic of the plant cell wall is 
shown  in  Fig.  4 .  The  middle  lamella  is  made  up  of  the  highest 
proportion of lignin. The primary cell wall is composed of pectin, 
hemicelluloses, and cellulose. The mature secondary cell wall con- 
tains most of the lignocellulosic biomass, but its organization and 
structure begin in the primary cell wall [94] . However, not all types 
of cells contain secondary cell walls. Based on the composition of 
polymers present and structure, the secondary cell wall can be di- 
vided into three parts (S1, S2, and S3). The S1 layer normally has 
a high concentration of lignin in secondary cell walls; the S2 layer 
contains more lignin than the S1 layer. The S2 layer also consists 
of the largest amounts of hemicelluloses and cellulose. In the sec- 
ondary cell wall, cellulose chains are linked together by hydrogen 
bonding,  and  these  linked  cellulose  chains  form  several  parallel 
sheets that constitute the microﬁbril structure. Concerning the S3 
layer, it has the least amount of lignin and forms the boundary 
of the lumen [95] . However, the integrated structures of cellulose, 
hemicelluloses, and lignin in plant cell walls are still not fully elu- 
cidated [96] . 

3.3.2. Hemicelluloses, cellulose, and lignin 

Hemicelluloses (also named polyose), cellulose (a polymer glu- 
cosan),  and  lignin  (a  complex  phenolic  polymer)  are  the  three 
main constituents in lignocellulosic biomass. Apart from these con- 
stituents,  biomass  also  contains  inorganic  materials  (also  called 
ash) and organic extractives [5] . The relative proportions of these 
constituents depend on the nature of biomass. For instance, hemi- 
celluloses contents (wt%) in hardwood, softwood, and agricultural 
biomass are 15-36 wt%, 11-27 wt%, and 22-35 wt%, respectively; 
cellulose  contents  in  these  materials  are  39-54  wt%,  41-50  wt%, 
and  24-50  wt%,  respectively,  and  lignin  contents  are  17-29  wt%, 
27-30 wt%, and 7-29 wt%, respectively [97] . The relative contents

The components and structures of hemicelluloses, cellulose, and 
lignin  are  extremely  different  from  one  another.  Hemicelluloses, 
4 ) m ,  contains  branched  mixtures  of  various 
denoted  by  (C 
polymerized monosaccharides (such as glucose, xylose, galactose, 
mannose, arabinose, and glucuronic acid) where m is polymeriza- 
tion  degree  with  values  of  10 0-20 0.  Hemicelluloses  have  higher 
reactivity than cellulose in that the braches, including acetic acid 
and  glucuronic  acid,  inhibit  the  constitution  of  hydrogen  bonds 
[75] . The decomposition temperature of hemicelluloses is between 
220 °C and 315 °C. Hence, when biomass is torreﬁed, a drastic im- 
pact on hemicelluloses is always observed. [59] .

linked  by  (1,  4)-glycosidic  bonds  [85] .  Cellulose  shows  a  higher 
carbon  content  than  those  of  other  lignocellulosic  components 
that respond to major energy content in biomass [98] . Cellulose 
molecules strongly tend to form inter- and intra-molecule hydro- 
gen bonds which shape crystalline micro-ﬁbrils were surrounded 
by amorphous cellulose [79] , resulting in the higher thermal sta- 
bility of cellulose than that of hemicelluloses [75] . The decomposi- 
tion temperature of cellulose is normally between 260 and 400 °C, 
where the initiation period has been explained as the formation of 
“active cellulose” through the depolymerization process [ 99 , 100 ].

Lignin,  denoted  by  (C

branched,  three-dimensional,  and  polyphenolic  substance  which 
consists of an irregular array of variously bonded “methoxy-” and 
“hydroxy-” replaced phenylpropane units [102] . Lignin in lignocel- 
lulosic biomass acts as a binding substance for hemicelluloses and 
cellulose structures [79] . During the densiﬁcation or pelletization, 
it also works as a glue. The glass transition temperature of lignin 
is between 135 °C and 165 °C [103] . When the temperature during

densiﬁcation is higher than the glass transition temperature and 
the  moisture  content  is  between  10  wt%  and  15  wt%,  lignin  in 
biomass softens and further enhances the inter-particles binding. 
The main part of lignin is thermally stable; thus, to complete the 
degradation  of  lignin  requires  suﬃcient  time  and  relatively  high 
temperatures. Even if lignin softens at temperatures as low as 80- 
90 °C [104] , its thermal decomposition temperature is in the range 
of 160-900 °C [ 99 , 100 ]. 

As  a  whole,  hemicelluloses  are  less  structured  than  cellulose 
and  their  sugar  composition  varies  widely  among  different  tree 
species. Cellulose is mainly responsible for the structural strength 
of biomass, and it plays an important role in providing a support- 
ing ﬁbrous mesh which is reinforced by lignin polymers [105] . The 
lignin biopolymers and other compounds are the ﬁllers in woody 
tissue making it a complex substance. On account of these inherent 
differences in com position and structure, the properties among the 
three constituents are different from each other. The hydrophobic- 
ity of cellulose is medium, while those of hemicelluloses and lignin 
are low and high, respectively [97] . Cellulose is characterized by 
the endothermic reaction when it is pyrolyzed; however, thermal 
degradation becomes exothermic if the charring or char formation 
process is signiﬁcant [106] . In contrast, the exothermic reaction is 
exhibited when hemicelluloses and lignin are thermally degraded 
[ 32 , 99 ]. The caloriﬁc values of cellulose and hemicelluloses are ap- 
proximately 17 and 18 MJ kg −1 , while it is between 23.3-26.6 MJ 
kg −1 for lignin [97] . Based on these HHV results, it indicates that 
the lignin content is positively correlated with the quality of the 
torreﬁed product. 

3.4. Biomass property variation from torrefaction 

There are several kinds of torrefaction processes as mentioned 
earlier.  However,  non-oxidative  torrefaction  is  the  major  method 
used to pretreat solid biomass and has a high potential for its ap- 
plication  in  the  industry.  Therefore,  the  attention  of  the  present 
study is paid to the non-oxidative torrefaction. For non-oxidative 
torrefaction,  the  entire  biomass  torrefaction  process  is  split  into 
ﬁve stages: (1) initial heating; (2) drying; (3) post-drying and in- 
termediate heating; (4) torrefaction; and (5) cooling, [107] , as illus- 
trated in the Fig. 6 . The ﬁve stages are described as follows [108] . 
In  the  initial  heating  stage,  the  biomass  is  heated  until  it 
reaches the desired temperature of the drying stage. Meanwhile, 
the moisture inside the biomass gradually evaporates at the end of 
this stage. 

In the drying stage, the temperature holds constant until the 
critical  moisture  content  is  reached,  while  free  water  of  the 
biomass is evaporated at a constant rate. The rate of water evapo- 
ration starts to decrease when reaching the critical moisture con- 
tent. 

In the post-drying and intermediate heating stage, the biomass 
is heated to 200 °C. Physically bound water is removed while the 
resistance  against  mass  and  heat  transfer  is  within  the  biomass 
particles. The biomass is almost free of water content at the end 
of this stage. Some mass loss can be expected during this stage, as 
a consequence of the evaporation of light organic compounds. 

The torrefaction stage contains a heating period and a cooling 
period. The biomass is torreﬁed when the reaction temperature ex- 
ceeds  200 °C.  This  stage  is  operated  under  constant  temperature 
called torrefaction temperature. Devolatilization starts during the 
heating period, continues during the period of constant tempera- 
ture, and stops during or after the period of cooling. 

In the cooling stage, the temperature of the torreﬁed product 
is  cooled  from  200 °C  to  room  temperature  or  the  desired  ﬁnal 
temperature. There is no mass loss during this period, while some 
evaporation of adsorbed reaction products may occur. 

As described earlier, raw biomass is known by its: (1) hygro- 
scopic  nature;  (2)  high  moisture  content  and  high  atomic  H/C 
and O/C ratios; (3) low caloriﬁc value; (4) poor grindability; (5) 
large volume or low bulk density; (6) higher biological degrada- 
tion; and (7) non-homogeneity. Recent researches suggest that the 
aforementioned drawbacks of raw biomass can be overcome once 
torrefaction is applied to solid biomass. In other words, the tor- 
reﬁed biomass possesses the following characteristics: (1) higher 
hydrophobicity or water-resistivity; (2) lower moisture content and 
atomic  H/C  and  O/C  ratios;  (3)  higher  caloriﬁc  value;  (4)  bet- 
ter grindability; (5) higher bulk and energy densities if densiﬁca- 
tion process is employed; (6) lower biological degradation; and (7) 
higher homogeneity in biomass. 

The change in biomass properties during torrefaction is ascribed 
to some reaction mechanisms involved and coupled. These mech- 
anisms  include  the  dehydroxylation  of  hemicelluloses  [109] ,  the 
deacetylation and decarboxylation of xylan-containing hemicellu- 
loses  polymers  [110] ,  partial  depolymerization  and  demethoxy- 
lation  from  cellulose  (shortening  of  cellulose  macro-ﬁbrils)  and 
lignin [111] , etc. The mass loss of biomass from thermal degrada- 
tion results in decarbonization, dehydrogenation, and deoxygena- 
tion in biomass [112-114] . The relevant mechanisms that occurred 
during biomass torrefaction and the resulting change in properties

signiﬁcant depolymerization occurs when the reaction temperature 
is beyond 300 °C [ 117 , 120 ]. 

Torrefaction of lignocellulosic biomass involves the degradation 
of  hemicelluloses,  cellulose,  and  lignin  at  different  tem perature 
stages. Biomass initially degrades from150 to 200 °C, due to dehy- 
dration and removal of light volatile [ 5 , 115 ]. When the temperature 
reaches  200 °C,  the  degradation  of  hemicelluloses  occurs,  includ- 
ing deacetylation and depolymerization reactions. The deacetyla- 
tion leads to the formation of acetic acid, which would catalyze the 
further  depolymerization  of  low-order  carbohydrates,  as  well  as 
condensation and degradation in lignin [ 116 , 117 ]. The amorphous 
phase of cellulose starts to decompose at around 200 °C to increase 
the relative crystallinity of biomass, while the crystalline phase of 
cellulose begins to decompose and the depolymerization of cellu- 
lose occurs at temperatures higher than 270 °C [118] . 

Lignin has a complicated and large structure compared to hemi- 
celluloses  and  cellulose.  Lignin  is  an  amorphous  tridimensional 
polymer consisted of three basic units; they are p-hydroxyphenyl 
(H), guaiacyl (G), and syringyl (S) units, respectively [119] . During 
biomass  torrefaction,  the  softening  of  lignin  starts  at  160-190 °C, 
the cleavage of α- and β-aryl-alkylether linkages occurs between 
150 °C and 300 °C, and the cleavage of aliphatic side chains occurs 
at around 300 °C. The cleavage of linkages leads to the removal of 
methoxyl groups (also called demethoxylation). Furthermore, the 

3.4.1. Color change 

The color of the feedstock is an intuitive indicator that changes 
when  the  feedstock  is  thermally  degraded  [121] .  The  colors  of 
the samples are measured by a colorimeter based on the three- 
dimensional CIELAB (Commission internationale de l’éclairage, L ∗
a ∗ b ∗) color space, which has been adopted to quantify the color 
change of treated biomass. In the CIELAB color space, the vertical 
coordinate for lightness L ∗ represents the position on the black- 
white axis (L ∗= 0 for pure black and L ∗= 100 for pure white). The 
chromatic coordinates a ∗ and b ∗ are characterized by the position 
of a horizontal plane. The chrome value of a ∗ stands for the posi- 
tion on the green-red axis ( + a ∗ for red and -a ∗ for green), while 
the chrome value of b ∗ responds the position on the blue-yellow 
axis ( + b ∗ for yellow and -b ∗ for blue). The equation for the total 
color difference (cid:4)E ∗ is given as (cid:4)E = 
( (cid:4)L 2 + (cid:4)a ∗2 + (cid:4)b ∗2 ) [122] . 
For instance, the color of raw wood chips ( Cryptomeria japonica ) 
(Fig. S1a) is close to yellow, which has higher L ∗, a ∗, and b ∗ val- 
ues. The L ∗, a ∗, and b ∗ values of wood chips decrease after they 
are torreﬁed at a low temperature of 250 °C, that changing their 
colors from yellow to light brown (Fig. S1b). When the biomass 
is torreﬁed at a higher temperature of 300 °C, the wood chips fur- 
ther turn their color to dark brown with even lower L ∗, a ∗, and

b ∗ values (Fig. S1c). The color change of biomass depends on the 
conditions of torrefaction. It has been found that the color change 
of biomass from brown to black occurs at the temperature range 
of 150-300 °C [115] . This primarily results from the changes in the 
chemical composition after torrefaction. The color change of tor- 
reﬁed wood can be attributed to several reactions. Firstly, the de- 
composition of hemicelluloses generates byproducts with different 
colors. Secondly, the acceleration of the color change of torreﬁed 
biomass is attributed to several factors such as the oxidation re- 
actions, the crosslinking reactions, and the condensation reactions 
from the cleavage of lignin β-O-4 ether bonds and aromatic methyl 
groups in lignin which lead to the formation of oxidative products 
like  quinones.  Thirdly,  the  enzyme-mediated  (Maillard)  reactions 
between polysaccharides (such as amino acids, sugars, and pheno- 
lic compounds) occur in thermal degradation. Lastly, the oxidative 
reactions between the extractives (in woody biomass) and atmo- 
sphere in the process of torrefaction are triggered [123–126] . This 
color change also implies the partial carbonization occurring at the 
wood surface during torrefaction. 

3.4.2. Transformation of hygroscopicity to hydrophobicity 

The raw biomass is hygroscopic owing to its inherent hydrogen- 
bonded to the hydroxyl groups of the cell wall components that 
can easily absorb the water [ 127 , 128 ]. The normal moisture con- 
tent of biomass ranges from 30 to 60 wt%, based on the period 
of storage, time of harvest, type, method (e.g., shedding) storage 
conditions  (such  as  temperature  and  humidity),  and  storage  lo- 
cation (indoor/outdoor) [129] . The Fourier Transformation Infrared 
(FTIR) analysis suggests that hydroxyl groups of raw biomass will 
be partly destroyed through dehydration [ 109 , 130 ] and dehydrox- 
ylation [109] reactions of hemicelluloses and cellulose in biomass 
[ 124 , 128 ]. This reduces the content of hydrogen bonding which re- 
sults in the hydrophobic characteristic [ 131 , 132 ] and the drastic re- 
duction in the EMC [ 133 , 134 ] of the torreﬁed biomass. The reduc- 
tion of absorbed water improves biomass durability [135] . 

The  hydrophobicity  of  biomass  can  be  identiﬁed  through  the 
tests of contact angle and EMC where the change in the wettability 
of biomass before and after torrefaction is evaluated [ 53 , 135 , 136 ]. 
The proﬁles of EMC (with conditions of 65% humidity for 6 h) and 
contact  angle  tests  of  poplar  wood  before  and  after  torrefaction 
are shown in Fig. 8 . The ﬁgure suggests that EMC decreases from 
5.72% (raw wood) to 3.27% (torreﬁed at 230 °C), accounting for a 
42.8% decreasing degree in EMC ( Fig. 8 a ). The sessile drop tech- 
nique is the most common method to measure the contact angle 
by observing a drop deposited on a solid surface [135] . It has been 
pointed out that small contact angles ( < 90 °) correspond to a hy- 
drophilic surface (with hygroscopic property), while large contact 
angles ( > 90 °) correspond to a hydrophobic surface (with low wet- 
tability)  [137] .  Fig.  8 b  shows  that  the  water  droplet  is  absorbed 
into the raw wood rapidly, as a consequence of its hygroscopic na- 
ture. Speciﬁcally, the contact angle is around 65 ° in the beginning 
and becomes 0 ° at around 4 s. In contrast, the contact angle of the 
torreﬁed woods can keep for a long time and are always greater 
than 90 °. The results unanimously suggest that the higher the tor- 
refaction temperature, the greater the contact angle. When the tor- 
refaction temperature increases from 200 to 230 °C, the contact an- 
gle increases from 94 ° to 107 °. 

The hydrophobic behavior of torreﬁed biomass can also be eval- 
uated by TGA curves. The weight loss of torreﬁed biomass between 
25  and  100 °C  is  minimal  when  compared  to  its  raw  biomass, 
whose  storage  conditions  were  controlled  under  25 °C  with  65% 
relative  humidity  [138] .  It  has  been  reported  that  the  formation 
of hydrophobicity has a highly linear correlation with the removal 
of hydroxyl groups and the formation of micropores [109] . More- 
over,  increasing  torrefaction  severity  can  enhance  the  hydropho- 
bicity of the torreﬁed sawdust [139] . The formed tar condensing

midity for 6 h) and (b) contact angle of poplar wood before and after torrefaction

inside the pores can lower the saturated moisture content in tor- 
reﬁed biomass and also inhibit the moist air passing through the 
solid. Owing to the apolar character of condensed tar, it can also 
prevent the condensation of water vapor inside the pores [133] . In 
summary, dehydration, dehydroxylation, and tar condensation are 
responsible for the transformation of hygroscopic biomass into hy- 
drophobic biochar, and the aforementioned mechanisms are illus- 
trated in Fig. 9 . 

3.4.3. Atomic H/C and O/C ratios (van Krevelen diagram) 

The  van  Krevelen  diagram  is  a  graphical  plot  to  show  the 
atomic hydrogen-to-carbon (H/C) and oxygen-to-carbon (O/C) ra- 
tios of fuels, especially for the solid fuels such as biomass, lignite, 
peat, charcoal, and coal [ 14 , 15 ], as shown in Fig. 10 . For fuel with 
higher energy density, the trend for the atomic H/C and O/C ratios 
becomes  lower.  Compared  to  coal,  biomass  has  higher  VM  con- 
tent and lower FC content. For example, the VM content in coal 
and biomass are normally in the ranges of 0.5-50 wt% and 67-88

3.4.4. Caloriﬁc value 

The  main  elements  in  biomass  are  carbon  (C),  hydrogen  (H), 
and  oxygen  (O)  which  construct  hemicelluloses,  cellulose,  and 
lignin; and a small amount of nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S). When 
burning the biomass, the major heat release is attributed to the 
oxidation  of  carbon.  Hydrogen  is  also  a  crucial  heat  source  in 
the  combustion  of  biomass,  but  hydrogen  in  biomass  is  mostly 
present as either C-H bonds or O-H bonds. The oxygen contained 
in biomass is beneﬁcial to combustion, but a higher oxygen con- 
tent in the biomass reduces its caloriﬁc value. Therefore, torrefac- 
tion is utilized to remove the undesired elements (H and O) in the 
solid products, achieving caloriﬁc values close to that of coal (25- 
35 MJ kg −1 ) [141] . Additionally, biomass with higher ash content 
has a lower caloriﬁc value. The carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur con- 
tents in biomass are lower compared to that of coal, while its hy- 
drogen and oxygen contents are higher. Besides, the high moisture 
content  in biomass leads to a lower  caloriﬁc value compared to 
coal. The summary of the fuel properties of raw biomass, torreﬁed 
biomass, and coal are depicted in Fig. 11 . 

3.4.5. Biological degradation 

Raw biomass inherently shows poor durability to fungi ( Fig. S2 ) 
After  biomass  undergoes torrefaction,  the  torreﬁed  biomass pos- 
sesses  a  higher  resistance  to  microbial  degradation.  With  regard 
to the biological degradation of torreﬁed biomass, several studies 
have been pointed out that torreﬁed lignocellulosic biomass can 
increase its durability [ 136 , 142 , 143 ]. After torrefaction, the impor- 
tant degradation of hemicelluloses, which are generally considered 
as  an  important  nutritive  source  for  the  development  of  wood- 
rotting fungi, leads to the improvement of durability. Meanwhile, 
the ineffectiveness of fungal peroxidases to degrade lignin can be 
explained by the modiﬁcation of the lignin network, which is un- 
able to be recognized by fungi. 

Overall, four factors justify the improved durability of torreﬁed 
wood  against  fungi  [136] :  (1)  improvement  of  the  hydrophobic 
characteristic of biomass, which limits the absorption of water into 
the biomass and the growth of fungi; (2) the new volatile prod- 
ucts are polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons derivatives of phenan- 
threne, acenaphthylene, and polyaromatics compounds [144] gen- 
erated during torrefaction can act as fungicides; (3) the modiﬁca- 
tion of wood polymers leads to a non-recognition of the polymers 
by enzymes involved in fungal degradation; and (4) the profound 
degradation of hemicelluloses from torrefaction results in less nu- 
tritive source for fungi growth. 

3.4.6. Grindability and reactivity 

Grindability improvement of torreﬁed biomass is an important 
upgrading of biomass for the post-application. After torrefaction, 
the cell-wall structures are represented with bigger ruptures and 
bigger pores, elucidating the signiﬁcant collapse of the cell walls 
[145] . This is attributed to the release of VM during torrefaction 
[146] .  Because  the  cell  walls  are  destroyed,  it  is  easier  to  grind 
the torreﬁed biomass, thereby improving the grindability. This im- 
provement in the grindability is crucial for fuel application. Specif- 
ically, better grindability of material is conducive to saving more 
energy if the biomass is pulverized into small particles [147] . 

The  energy  required  during  the  grinding  process  of  torreﬁed 
biomass  could  be  signiﬁcantly  decreased  by  40-88%  when  com- 
pared to the grinding of raw biomass [148] . Wang et al. [149] eval- 
uated  the  grindability  of  torreﬁed  Norway  spruce  stem  wood, 
stump,  and  bark.  The  grindability  of  Norway  spruce  was  signif- 
icantly  improved  after  torrefaction.  They  indicated  that  the  en- 
ergy required for grinding torreﬁed stem wood and stump under 
225 °C of torrefaction could be reduced up to 50% compared to un- 
treated samples. Phanphanich and Mani [150] evaluated the effect 
of torrefaction on the grindability of wood chips (WC) and logging

tion.

wt%, respectively. The FC contents in coal and biomass are 46-92 
wt%  and  0.5-20  wt%,  respectively  [5] .  When  biomass  undergoes 
torrefaction,  the  dehydration  and  devolatilization  processes  pro- 
ceed. This results in the removal of moisture and light volatile frac- 
tions that contain most of the H and O inside the biomass [140] . 
The liberation of these materials leads to decarbonization, dehy- 
drogenation, and deoxygenation reactions [ 112 , 113 ], that is, some 
of the atoms C, H, and O are lost from the thermal pretreatment. 
Nevertheless, the decarbonization extent in torrefaction is smaller 
than the dehydrogenation and deoxygenation extents. As a conse- 
quence, relatively more carbon remains in torreﬁed products, and 
the atomic H/C and O/C ratios thus decrease. 

Based  on  the  chemical  formulas  of  hemicelluloses,  cellulose, 
and lignin shown in Fig. 10 , their atomic H/C ratios are 1.67, 1.6, 
and 1.19-1.53, respectively, whereas the atomic O/C ratios in cel- 
lulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin are approximately 0.83, 0.80 and 
0.47-0.36, respectively. [5] . Most of the hemicelluloses and partial 
cellulose in biomass are thermally decomposed by torrefaction, de- 
pending on the torrefaction severity, whereas biomass with lower 
atomic H/C and O/C ratios relatively retains more lignin. This also 
corresponds to the trend of decreasing the two ratios with increas- 
ing the torrefaction severity.

residues (LR). The results indicated that the speciﬁc energy con- 
sumption for grinding torreﬁed biomass could save up to 10 times 
for torreﬁed WC, and up to 6 times for torreﬁed LR when com- 
pared to that of raw biomass. They also suggested that the spe- 
ciﬁc grinding energy consumption was linearly correlated with tor- 
refaction temperature. The particle size distributions for raw and 
torreﬁed sugarcane bagasse in comparison to four reference coals 
have been determined [151] , as presented in Fig. 12 . The ground 
samples were sieved with mesh sizes from 53 to 600 μm, and the 
retained mass of each mesh was calculated based on original dried 
sample mass. The reduced particle sizes of sugarcane bagasse could 
stand for the improved grindability of sugarcane bagasse and sig- 
niﬁcantly decrease the energy consumption during biomass grind- 

ing. Thus, the consumed energy of grinding biomass undergoing 
torrefaction can be largely reduced. 

Hardgrove grindability index (HGI) is a common indicator to ex- 
amine the grinding scale of biomass for milling and to evaluate the 
diﬃculty of grinding a solid sample into the powder [152] . The HGI 
depended on the torrefaction severity wherein the higher the HGI 
value, the easier the grinding [153] . It was found that a high HGI 
of torreﬁed beech was featured by moderate or easy grinding when 
the mass loss of beech was higher than 30% from torrefaction. Af- 
ter grinding, the particle shape and size of the ground torreﬁed 
biomass  has  been  signiﬁcantly  reduced  with  enhanced  bulk  and 
energy density [147] . Because of this, the ground torreﬁed biomass 
shows an excellent application for fuel pulverization and co-ﬁring 
in power plant or gasiﬁcation.

The recognition of fuel reactivity such as ignition and burnout 
is  of  the  utmost  importance  when  torreﬁed  biomass  is  used  as 
a solid fuel [154] . The ignition and burnout temperatures of tor- 
reﬁed biomass are raised compared to its raw counterpart, stem- 
ming  from  the  devolatilization  and  depolymerization  during  the 
torrefaction [155] . Li et al. [156] examined the combustion prop- 
erties of biochar from the torrefaction of Miscanthus ﬂoridulus and 
Australia  coal  by  TG.  The  ignition  and  burnout  temperatures  of 
Australia  coal  (447  and  887 °C)  were  both  higher  than  those  of 
biochar (266 and 489 °C). They also evaluated the combustion char- 
acteristic index (S) of Australia coal and biochar. A higher S value 
of fuel stood for its better combustion performance. The S value 
of  biochar  (49.70)  was  much  higher  than  that  of  Australia  coal 
(0.87). The higher S value of the biochar was ascribed to its lower 
ignition and burnout temperatures and higher mass-loss rate. Mi 
et  al.  [157]  investigated  the  combustion  and  pyrolysis  behaviors 
of torreﬁed wood, torreﬁed bamboo, and their blends. They dis- 
covered that the torreﬁed biomass had higher combustion and py- 
rolysis peak temperatures, as a consequence of removals of mois- 
ture and volatile, as well as thermal degradation of hemicelluloses, 
cellulose, and lignin from torrefaction. They also found that there 
was no synergistic effect during combustion and pyrolysis of the 
different blends. Chen et al. [113] examined the combustion per- 
formance  of  various  torreﬁed  biomass  materials  in  a  drop  tube 
furnace. The examinations from the burnout and R-factor of the 
samples suggested that a higher burnout was reached and more 
volatile  products  were  released  with  raw  and  torreﬁed  biomass 
at 250 °C than at 300 °C. The results of R-factors from the exam- 
ined fuels demonstrated that torreﬁed biomass facilitated the gas- 
phase or solid-phase combustion. Ndibe et al. [158] examined the 
co-ﬁring characteristics of torreﬁed biomass (50%) and coals (50%). 
The results showed that the torreﬁed biomass blended fuels could 
be ignited faster, but generated more elongated ﬂames with higher 
volatile  yields.  This  created  a  more  elongated  combustion  zone 
compared to the intense and short coal ﬂame. 

3.5. Torrefaction parameters 

The performance of torrefaction is affected by some factors such 
as temperature, duration, and carrier gas ﬂow rate and its compo- 
sition, particle size, the presence of the catalyst, etc. The inﬂuences 
of these parameters on torrefaction performance are described be- 
low. 

3.5.1. Temperature 

Torrefaction  temperature  is  the  most  important  parameter 
among the operating parameters. The thermal decomposition tem- 
peratures of hemicelluloses and cellulose are in the ranges of 220- 
315 °C and 315-400 °C, respectively, while torrefaction is operated 
at temperatures of 20 0-30 0 °C, it is thus known that the operat- 
ing temperature has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the results of tor- 
refaction.  Torrefaction  can  be  categorized  into  light  torrefaction 
(200 °C to 235 °C), mild torrefaction (235 °C to 275 °C), and severe 
torrefaction (275 °C to 300 °C), according to torrefaction tempera- 
ture  [102] .  During  light  torrefaction,  moisture  and  light  (or  low 
molecular  weight)  volatiles  in  biomass  are  released.  Hemicellu- 
loses  in  biomass  are  the  most  active  components  among  hemi- 
celluloses, cellulose, and lignin. Hemicelluloses are thermally de- 
graded to a certain extent during light torrefaction, whereas cel- 
lulose and lignin are only slightly or hardly affected [130] . There- 
fore, the weight loss of biomass after light torrefaction is not pro- 
nounced  and  its  energy  density  or  caloriﬁc  value  increases  only 
slightly. When biomass undergoes mild torrefaction, hemicelluloses 
decomposition  and  volatile  liberation  are  facilitated.  Hemicellu- 
loses are substantially depleted and cellulose is also consumed to a 
certain extent. In the case of severe torrefaction, hemicelluloses are 

almost depleted completely and cellulose is thermally degraded to 
a  great  extent.  Among  the  constituents,  lignin  is  the  most  diﬃ- 
cult to be thermally degraded and its weight loss within the tem- 
perature range of orrefaction is low. Hemicelluloses and cellulose 
are the main constituents of biomass. Owing to the substantial re- 
moval of hemicelluloses and cellulose from biomass by severe tor- 
refaction, the weight and energy yield of biomass usually decrease 
vigorously, even though the energy density of the fuel is greatly 
enhanced. 

3.5.2. Reaction time (duration) 

Apart  from  temperature,  torrefaction  time  or  duration  is  an- 
other important factor in evaluating torrefaction performance and 
severity.  Torrefaction  is  normally  conducted  for  several  minutes 
[ 57 , 159 ]  to  several  hours  [ 145 , 160 ].  The  caloriﬁc  value  of  resul- 
tant solid fuel or biochar is enhanced by torrefaction, and an in- 
crease in duration raises the carbon content and heating value in 
the biomass. For instance, the torrefaction of wood briquettes op- 
erated under 250 °C for 0.5, 1 and 1.5 h showed that the caloriﬁc 
values of the biomass increased from 20.0 to 22.7 kJ kg −1 , while 
the longer torrefaction duration would take more energy for the 
thermal pretreatment [133] . The results of TG [59] showed that the 
rapid thermal degradation of biomass occurred at torrefaction time 
less than one hour, and tended to be very slow beyond one hour. 
Consequently, torrefaction duration is normally controlled within 
one hour. An overview of the typical operating ranges of temper- 
ature and residence time, the impacts of reaction temperature on 
the properties of biomass prevails over the treatment time. Differ- 
ent combinations of temperature and residence time can be used 
to reach a given torrefaction degree, as expressed by the weight 
loss  [159] .  On  the  other  hand,  the  crucial  properties  of  the  tor- 
reﬁed product such as HHV and saturated moisture uptake can be 
correlated by the weight loss or torrefaction severity of biomass 
[ 132 , 159 ] 

3.5.3. Particle size 

The particle size is one of the important parameters for biomass 
torrefaction [ 161 , 162 ]. Biomass has poor heat conductivity, while 
the  temperature  gradient  across  the  particle  will  inﬂuence  the 
biomass pyrolysis mechanism [52] . In general, smaller particles can 
promote  the  heat  and  mass  transfer  to  keep  the  relatively  con- 
stant temperature within them during pyrolysis, thereby enhanc- 
ing bio-oil production by restraining the char formation and sec- 
ondary cracking of vapors [163] . On the other hand, large particles 
will inhibit bio-oil formation. The main output for pyrolysis nor- 
mally is bio-oil rather than biochar. However, particle size reduc- 
tion (milling or grinding) can be costly and signiﬁcantly increase 
the  overall  cost  of  the  biomass  pyrolysis  operation.  It  will  be  a 
trade-off issue between the cost and eﬃciency of the pyrolysis pro- 
cess when regarding particle sizes. 

The experimental results showed that increasing particle length 
could  enhance  mass  and  energy  yields,  but  opposite  with  parti- 
cle  diameter  [164] .  The  particle  size  had  an  impact  on  the  tor- 
refaction severity, especially under high temperatures [161] . During 
torrefaction, although the temperature gradient for particles with 
sizes smaller than 1 mm is very small, the torrefaction reaction 
rate is affected by internal diffusion from generated vapors inside 
the particles. The torrefaction of wood sawdust with different par- 
ticle sizes (0.25-0.5, 0.5-1.0, and 1.0-2.0 mm) in a continuous slot- 
rectangular spouted bed (SRSB) reactor was studied by Wang et al. 
[162] . They found that larger particle size limited the performance 
of  the  reactor.  When  the  particle  size  increased,  the  solid  yield 
of torreﬁed biomass was decreased, leading to a decrease in the 
energy yield. Bates  and Ghoniem [165] developed a comprehen- 
sive one-dimensional model to describe the torrefaction of a sin- 
gle woody biomass particle. For a larger size biomass sample, the 

14

heat released from chemical reactions during torrefaction caused 
signiﬁcant intraparticle gradients and accelerated the degradation 
of the biomass. In addition, because of the rise in the reaction rate 
at  higher  temperatures,  the  sensitivity  of  torrefaction  to  particle 
size also increased. 

the biomass surface. In contrast, when biomass underwent oxida- 
tive torrefaction, increasing air superﬁcial velocity diminished the 
solid yield, regardless of the torrefaction temperature [68] . It im- 
plied, in turn, that the oxidative torrefaction of biomass was con- 
trolled by the surface oxidation. 

3.5.4. Carrier gas

2 and CO 

In general, the torrefaction is performed in an N 

2 atmosphere. 
Recently,  some  studies  evaluated  the  effects  of  different  carrier 
2 , air, ﬂue gas, etc., on torrefaction performance 
gases, such as CO 
[67] .  It  was  reported  that  the  CO 
2  as  a  torrefaction  medium 
could  promote  the  thermodegradation  of  biomass  and  the  ther- 
mal cracking of the released volatile compounds during torrefac- 
tion [ 67 , 166 ]. Hernández et al. [167] performed the torrefaction of 
2 in a TG-FTIR. Their results indi- 
sewage sludge under N 
cated that the presence of CO 
2 exhibited reactive behavior during 
torrefaction, resulting in an increase of the decomposition rate and 
shifting the characteristic degradation peak to a lower temperature 
around 7 °C. The effect of CO 
2 on the torrefaction of woody biomass 
in a temperature range of 20 0-30 0 °C was explored [67] . It revealed 
that the CO

2 will lead to the combustion process rather than the tor- 
age of O 
refaction process. The main purpose of adding O 
2 is to enhance the 
torrefaction reaction. The oxidative torrefaction of biomass involves 
not  only  thermal  decomposition  and  devolatilization  of  biomass 
but also the exothermic oxidation reactions [ 169 , 171 ]. The reaction 
rates of oxidation reactions are normally faster than the decom- 
position reactions and devolatilization, leading to the reduction of 
the  torrefaction  duration  [171] .  The  effects  of  oxygen  concentra- 
tions (2, 6, 10, and 21%) on the torrefaction of Eucalyptus grandis at 
240 and 280 °C were evaluated by Rousset et al. [172] . The results 
suggested that the effects of the oxygen amount on the solid yield 
and torreﬁed product properties were more marked under a tor- 
refaction temperature of 280 °C. The torrefaction of oil palm ﬁber 
pellets (OPFP) in inert and oxidative atmospheres showed that the 
oxidative torrefaction resulted in higher FC and lower VM in tor- 
reﬁed  OPFP  when  compared  with  the  non-oxidative  torrefaction 
[170] . This is due to the higher reaction extent of VM in the course 
of  oxidative  torrefaction.  Uemura  et  al.  [173]  conducted  the  tor- 
refaction of oil palm empty fruit bunches (EFB) in a batch reactor 
2 + 71 vol% 
under a ﬂue gas atmosphere (9 vol% O 
N 
2 ). They pointed out that a decrease in the solid yield and an in- 
crease in HHV were obtained after torrefaction, as a consequence 
of enhanced decomposition by O 
2 in the ﬂue gas. The rel- 
evant studies concerning the effects of carrier gas on torrefaction 
are summarized in Table S1.

3.5.5. Carrier gas ﬂow rate 

Some studies have investigated the effect of ﬂow rate (or su- 
perﬁcial velocity) on torrefaction [ 68 , 174 ]. The results revealed that 
the superﬁcial velocity of the carrier gas played no role in the tor- 
refaction performance in the inner conditions [ 68 , 175 ]. Asadullah 
et al. [176] examined the effect of sweeping gas (N 
2 ) ﬂow rate on 
palm  kernel  shell  torrefaction.  The  gas  ﬂow  rate  was  controlled 
from  100  mL  min −1  to  10 0 0  mL  min −1 ,  providing  the  superﬁ- 
cial velocity from 3.5 cm min −1 to 35.0 cm min −1 . They reported 
that  the  increase  of  the  superﬁcial  velocity  helped  to  move  out 
the volatile products during torrefaction. However, the solid yield 
was almost unchanged with the variation of the superﬁcial veloc- 
ity. This observation implied that the torrefaction performance was 
dominated by heat and mass transfer in biomass rather than on 

15 

Studies have shown that inorganic metals in biomass could play 
a  role  as  catalysts  in  the  thermochemical  processes  of  biomass, 
thereby  inﬂuencing  char  formation  [177] ,  distribution  of  pyroly- 
sis  products  [178] ,  gasiﬁcation  [179] ,  and  combustion  [180] .  Al- 
kali metals and alkaline earth metals have attracted attention as 
promising catalysts for the thermochemical conversion of biomass 
[181] . Recently, some researchers have examined the inﬂuences of 
inorganic  metals  on  biomass  torrefaction  [ 182 , 183 ].  Relevant  ex- 
perimental results pointed out that potassium or sodium was cat- 
alytically active in the degradation of biomass during torrefaction 
[183] . The effects of potassium on torrefaction performance by a 
thermogravimetric analyzer addressed that the mass loss of woody 
biomass  increased  with  rising  K +  concentration  [183] .  At  higher 
torrefaction temperatures (270 and 280 °C), the catalyst effect was 
more signiﬁcant. During torrefaction, potassium plays an important 
catalytic role in the thermodegradation of cellulose in biomass, in- 
volving two pathways:(1) cleavages of C-H, C-C bonds, and glyco- 
sidic linkage, and (2) cleavage of hydrogen bond [184] . The effects 
of  K 
3  addition  on  the  condensable  species  during  wood  tor- 
refaction were studied by GC-MS [185] . The results indicated that 
the potassium enhanced the formation of acetol and acetic acid. 
The number of lignin derivatives, like syringol and 4- vinylguaiacol 
guaiacol, also rose with increasing impregnated K 
3 concentra- 
tion. The catalytic effects of potassium were examined on biomass 
torrefaction at 150 °C to 300 °C by TG [186] . The results revealed 
that with the same mass loss, at least 28% of time reduction for 
the torrefaction of K + -impregnated biomass was observed, and the 
maximum  time  saving  could  achieve  93%.  However,  it  has  been 
found that potassium was less inﬂuential on hemicelluloses. The 
insigniﬁcant impact on hemicelluloses from the addition of potas- 
sium could be due to that single polymers are not affected in the 
same way as in the whole biomass where potassium could affect 
the interaction between biopolymers [ 185 , 187 ].

3.5.7. Performance index 

The  torrefaction  performance  is  highly  corresponding  to  tor- 
refaction severity (TS) [31] , which is mainly dominated by torrefac- 
tion duration and temperature. Recently, numbers of indexes, such 
as torrefaction severity index (TSI), severity factor (SF), weight loss 
(WL), torrefaction severity factor (TSF), energy-mass co-beneﬁt in- 
dex (EMCI), and upgrading energy index (UEI), have been deﬁned 
to evaluate torrefaction performance. WL, generally calculated with 
a dry basis, is the most widely used index to represent TS in that 
an increase in torrefaction duration or temperature gives rise to 
higher WL. Meanwhile, the inﬂuence of TS on the FC [188] or car- 
bon content [189] , HHV [ 188 , 189 ], the enhancement of HHV [190] , 
color change [145] , hygroscopicity [145] , and energy yield [191] can 
also be evaluated by WL. In some cases, WL is replaced by solid 
yield to indicate TS [192] . 

TSI is developed to identify the torrefaction degree and is de- 

ﬁned as: 

TSI = 

W L 
W L 

ref 
where WL and (cid:4)WL 
ref stands for the weight loss of the sample at 
a certain torrefaction operation and a reference operation, respec- 
tively. (cid:4)WL 
ref  is based on the highest TS condition, normally at 
300 °C for 60 min. According to this deﬁnition, the value of TSI is 
in the range of 0-1. In the study of Chen [193] , they performed the 

(1) 

W.-H. Chen, B.-J. Lin, Y.-Y. Lin et al. 

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 82 (2021) 100887 

torrefaction of microalga residue ( Chlorella vulgaris ESP-31) for 15- 
60 min at 20 0-30 0 °C, and the results revealed that the TSI gradient 
versus duration was smaller than that versus temperature. Accord- 
ing to the observation, they reported that torrefaction temperature 
showed a more signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the solid yield compared 
to treatment duration. 

SF was initially introduced to determine the extent of biomass 
pretreatment by aqueous solvent or steam [ 194 , 195 ], and was de- 
ﬁned as [ 196 , 197 ]: 

(cid:4)
(cid:3) 
t × exp 
SF = log 

(cid:5)(cid:6) 

T H − T R 
14 . 75 

(2) 

where t is the pretreatment time (min), T H  is the reaction tem- 
perature ( °C), and T R  is the reference temperature ( = 100 °C). Re- 
cently, some studies have adopted SF to evaluate the performance 
of the steam explosion [198] and torrefaction [196] . In the study 
of Lee [196] , SF was adopted to account for the effect of TS on the 
biopolymers in the biomass. When the SF value was low, torrefac- 
tion had an important effect on the degradation of hemicelluloses, 
but not on cellulose or lignin. 

Concerning to TSF, it was suggested by introducing a time ex- 

ponent in SF: 

(cid:4)
(cid:3) 
α × exp 
TSF = log 
t 

(cid:5)(cid:6) 

T H − T R 
14 . 75 

(3) 

In  the  above  formula,  the  value  of  T R  could  be  adjusted  for 
ﬁnding a more suitable reference temperature to describe the im- 
pact of torrefaction. Moreover, by introducing a time exponent α, 
the  thermodegradation  nature  of  biomass  to  torrefaction  condi- 
tions was taken into account, and its optimum value, namely, αopt , 
could be acquired. Chen et al. [192] evaluated the TSF of differ- 
ent  torreﬁed  biomasses  (spent  coffee  grounds,  Chinese  medicine 
residue, Arthrospira platensis residue, C. sp . JSC4), and determined 
the αopt values of the materials with T R = 0 °C. The results indicated 
that the optimum time exponent ( αopt ) in TSF with maximizing R 2 
value was between 1.6 and 3.0. These values suggested the larger 
inﬂuence of duration on TS when compared to SF. 

Unlike WL, TSI, SF, and TSF, EMCI and UEI are used to evaluate 
the torrefaction outcome in terms of energy production and ma- 
terial storage. EMCI is represented by the difference between the 
energy yield and the solid yield [100] . Physically, a higher EMCI 
value stands for the torreﬁed product with higher energy yield and 
lower material volume, which is conducive to fuel production with 
storage due to smaller volume. Lu et al. [100] evaluated the tor- 
refaction of oil palm ﬁber (OPF) and eucalyptus in nitrogen and air 
atmospheres. They found that, for the torrefaction of OPF in N 
2 and 
air, the maximum values of EMCI were19.0 and 7.7, respectively, 
and at 300 °C and 250 °C, respectively, indicating that the optimum 
operations occurred at the two temperatures. Concerning eucalyp- 
tus torrefaction in N 
2 and air, the optimum operations developed 
at 325 and 275 °C where the EMCI values were 18.9 and 14.0, re- 
spectively. 

The  UEI  is  a  ratio  of  the  torrefaction  energy  yield  (based  on 
HHV) to the energy input (supplied electricity, kWh) into the tor- 
refaction  system  [199] .  From  this  deﬁnition,  an  increase  in  UEI 
means higher energy eﬃciency of a torrefaction process, as a re- 
sult of higher energy yield or lower energy input. The results of 
biomass  waste  (coffee  grounds  and  microalga  residue)  torrefac- 
tion by conventional and microwave heating showed that the UEI 
value by microwave torrefaction was higher than that by conven- 
tional torrefaction in light torrefaction, as shown in Fig. 13 . From 
the results of UEI, the microwave torrefaction presented higher en- 
ergy eﬃciency and shorter duration than conventional torrefaction 
[200] .

3.6. Torrefaction kinetics 

Thermal  degradation  of  biomass  in  course  of  torrefaction  in- 
volves a series of complex chemical reactions. The decomposition 
of lignocellulosic biomass mainly happens at cell walls which are 
primarily comprised of hemicelluloses, cellulose, and lignin [201–
203] .  The  degradation  of  microalgal  biomass  relates  to  the  de- 
composition of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids [ 7 , 31 ]. The ki- 
netic analysis is an eﬃcient way to recognize the characteristics 
of biomass thermodegradation [ 204 , 205 ]. In general, there are two 
basic modes adopted for biomass pyrolysis kinetics: isothermal ki- 
netics  and  non-isothermal.  According  to  these  two  basic  modes, 
several  different  models  such  as  the  one-step  model  (or  called 
model-free) [206] , the two-step model [5] , the multi-step model 
[207] , and the multi-components model [ 119 , 208 ] have been de- 
veloped ( Fig. S3 ).

For  the  thermodegradation  kinetics  of  biomass  torrefaction, 
the  isothermal  pyrolysis  kinetics  is  generally  applied to  describe 
the degradation mechanisms of biomass [ 209 , 210 ]. Chen and Kuo 
[64]  developed  a  one-step  torrefaction  kinetics  model  to  predict 
the thermal decompositions of xylan, cellulose, and lignin at 200- 
300 °C. The proposed values of the reaction order on xylan, cellu- 
lose, and lignin, and are 9, 3, and 1, while the corresponding acti- 
vation energy values are 67.83, 124.42, and 37.58 kJ mol −1 , respec- 
tively. The reaction rate is proportional to the order of the con- 
centration of a single reactant in the kinetics theory. The higher 
reaction order of a reaction implies that the reaction can be trig- 
gered more easily. Therefore, the degradation rate of xylan is much 
higher than those of cellulose and lignin. Chen et al. (2014a) eval- 
uate the kinetics for non-isothermal and isothermal torrefaction of 
Scenedesmus obliquus (CNW-N). The results revealed that the reac- 
tion severity of non-isothermal torrefaction was higher than that 
of isothermal torrefaction at the same average temperature. 

A non-linear regression method was used to determine the tor- 
refaction kinetics of Ceiba pentandra (Araba) and Alstonia congensis 
(Ahun) from the one-step model [211] . The results indicated that 
the reaction orders of Araba and Ahun were 2.15 and 2.28, while 
the corresponding activation energies were 134.45 kJ mol −1  and 
143.38 kJ mol −1 , respectively. 

A multi-step model was adopted to investigate the kinetics of 
aspen by torrefaction as studied by Klinger et al. [212] . The evo- 
lutions of various chemical species were predicted based on the 
degradation of hemicelluloses. The proposed kinetics model could 
accurately  establish  the  dynamic  proﬁles  of  gaseous  products  at 
the initial stages of torrefaction (up to 30% mass loss) in the tem- 
perature range of 260 to 300 °C. 

Torrefaction kinetics for different wood species (eucalyptus, lo- 
cust, and spruce) in the temperature range of 210 to 290 °C with 
long treatment duration were studied by Cavagnol et al. [207] . A 
variety  of  multi-step  series  reaction  mechanisms  were  explored 
from the literature (one, two, and three-step models) for the de- 
termination of kinetic parameters. They reported that the two-step 
model provided an acceptable accuracy for the mass loss predic- 
tions in the course of torrefaction. The kinetics for isothermal tor- 
refaction of industrial solid wastes (oilcloth and PVC) was deter- 
mined by an independent parallel reaction (IPR) model [213] . The 
results revealed that a high heating rate was more eﬃcient for the 
non-isothermal torrefaction of the oilcloth waste. In contrast, PVC 
waste pretreated with a low heating rate could achieve more en- 
ergy saving.

The isothermal pyrolysis kinetics is widely applied for biomass 
torrefaction by the two-step model, as tabulated in Table S2, which 
is related to the release of volatiles, and intermediate and char for- 
mation  [214] .  The  solid-phase  pseudo-components  (A,  B,  and  C) 
represent the initial raw biomass (A), intermediate (B), and ﬁnal 
2 stand for the volatile prod- 
char or residual (C), while V

ucts. The reaction rate constants are denoted by k 
k 
V 2 . Di Blasi and Lanzetta [214] ﬁrstly developed the two-step ki- 
netic model, and reported that the reaction occurred at the ﬁrst 
step was attributed to the degradation of hemicelluloses and ex- 
tractives removal. While the second step reaction accounted for the 
decomposition of hemicelluloses, cellulose, and part of lignin [215] . 
The rate equation of each reaction was assumed to be the solid re- 
action and ﬁrst order [216] . The reaction rate constant k (s −1 ) for 
every reaction was calculated using the Arrhenius law, expressed 
−E a 
RT  ) , where i = A ,  B ,  C ,  V 
i 
i = A 
1 , and V 
2 . In the Arrhe- 
as k 
nius equation, A 
i is the activation 
i is the pre-exponential factor, Ea 
energy of component i , R is the universal gas constant, and T is 
the absolute temperature. Sheng et al [216] obtained the torrefac- 
tion kinetics of wood chips in a pilot-scale reactor by using the 
two-step model. They established a correlation between the HHV 

i exp ( 

and the predicted mass yield to estimate the energy yield of tor- 
reﬁed chips. A two-step kinetic model was introduced to describe 
the mass loss dynamics during spruce torrefaction with different 
contents of impregnated potassium (K) [217] . For the cases with 
different concentrations of K, they adopted the same activation en- 
ergy but different pre-exponential factors for the rate constants to 
have the kinetics, and the calculated results had good agreement 
with experiments. In the study of Silveira et al. [218] , the torrefac- 
tion kinetics of poplar wood boards by a two-step scheme with 
a three-stage approach was evaluated. They pointed out that the 
root-mean-square deviations of the direct approach and the three- 
stage approach were 0.363 and 0.235, respectively, implying 35% of 
improvement by the proposed three-stage approach. The kinetics 
for the torrefaction of woods (poplar and ﬁr) in a semi-industrial 
reactor was determined through the two-step model [219] . The ob- 
tained kinetics were applied for the predictions of elemental com- 
position (C, H, and O) in the woods during torrefaction. The ele- 
mental H and O in poplar and ﬁr signiﬁcantly decreased when the 
reaction temperature was higher than 170 °C, resulting from a de- 
volatilization reaction in the course of torrefaction. Based on the 
predicted C, H, and O in the woods, the extents of decarboniza- 
tion  (DC),  dehydrogenation  (DH),  and  deoxygenation  (DO)  were 
also evaluated. Because of the higher intensity of devolatilization in 
poplar during torrefaction, the intensities of DC, DH, and DO were 
all larger than in ﬁr. 

4. Torrefaction reaction systems 

Overall, the reaction system of biomass torrefaction for produc- 
ing carbon-neutral fuels to replace coal consists of a feeding unit 
for feedstock, a pretreatment unit, a reactor, and a post-treatment 
unit.  The  details  of  each  aforementioned  unit  are  tabulated  in 
Table 6 . 

4.1. Feedstock 

In recent studies concerning biomass torrefaction, a variety of 
biomass materials have been adopted as the feedstock. Lignocellu- 
losic biomass or energy crops (e.g., bamboo, pine, spruce, willow, 
eucalyptus, banyan, larch, beech, birch, wood briquettes, and wood 
pellets, etc.) are the most important and commonly used materials 
for the feedstocks of torrefaction. The torrefaction of agricultural 
residues and forestry wastes (e.g., sawdust, bagasse, coffee residue, 
rice husk and straw, wheat straw, oil palm empty fruit bunches, 
etc.)  has  also  been  investigated.  However,  to  prevent  the  imbal- 
ance  of  the  food  supplies  and  forest  vegetation  worldwide,  the 
sources of feedstock from non-agriculture biomass or even unus- 
able wastes are promoted recently. Third-generation biofuels from 
algal  biomass,  including  microalgae  and  macroalgae,  are  gaining 
more attention in the bioenergy ﬁeld, owing to its rapid growth 
rate, high carbon ﬁxing eﬃciency, and higher yield per unit area 
than terrestrial biomass [ 31 , 220 ]. 

In addition to the aforementioned ﬁrst to third-generation bio- 
fuels, the waste-to-fuel technology is developed recently. For in- 
stance, municipal solid waste (MSW), food waste, industrial waste, 
sewage sludge from municipal and industrial wastewater, and dairy 
manure have also been investigated as the torrefaction feedstock 
[221] . In the overview of the literature, torrefaction is a promis- 
ing technology to transform versatile feedstocks into biofuels. The 
torrefaction conditions and results (i.e., heating value and energy 
yield) on different feedstocks are summarized in Table S3. 

The recognition of the basic properties of biomass plays an im- 
portant  role  in  pretreatment  choice  and  the  thermodegradation. 
In  general,  the  basic  characterizations  of  biomass  include  proxi- 
mate analysis, caloriﬁc analysis, elemental analysis (ultimate anal- 
ysis), ﬁber analysis, composition analysis, and metal analysis. The

Description 

The selection of the feedstock will lead to 
different outcomes. The basic 
characterizations are thus required to identify 
the compositions of the feedstock, mainly 
including proximate analysis, elemental 
analysis, and composition analysis, etc. 
To enhance the eﬃciency of the torrefaction 
process, pretreating the feedstock is an 
essential step. For instance, the drying 
process to remove the intrinsic water and 
grinding the feedstock to increase the particle 
reaction area are the common pretreatments 
adopted before torrefaction. 
Various types of reactors have been 
developed maturely such as batch types or 
continuous types. Each type of reactor has its 
advantages and disadvantages, and the 
selection of the reactor depends on the 
requirement and purpose of the user. 
To further enhance the qualities of torreﬁed 
products in terms of higher energy density, 
convenient transportation, and handling, 
post-treatment such as densiﬁcation is thus 
operated. 

requirements of the analyses depend on the nature and source of 
biomass. 

lulose content renders lower solid yield compared to lower hemi- 
cellulose content [ 59 , 237 ]. 

The proximate analysis consists of the measurements of mois- 
ture, VM, FC, and ash, which can be performed using an oven or 
furnace by following standard methods for different kinds of feed- 
stock, as provided in Table S4 [222] . The thermogravimetric ana- 
lyzer can also be employed to conduct the proximate analysis with 
a small amount of feedstock [ 223 , 224 ]. 

The caloriﬁc analysis includes the HHV and the lower heating 
value (LHV) where their difference is from the latent heat of the 
water.  The  HHV  of  a  sample  can  be  measured  directly  using  a 
bomb calorimeter. Alternatively, several predicted formulas can be 
used to calculate the HHV and LHV of feedstock based on the re- 
sults of elemental analysis and/or proximate analysis [225] . 

The elemental analysis normally includes the measurements of 
carbon (C), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), and sulfur (S) in 
a feedstock. When dairy manure [ 226 , 227 ], food waste [ 228 , 229 ], 
or sewage sludge [ 230 , 231 ] are used as feedstock, the contents of 
the phosphorus (P) and chlorine (Cl) are also determined through 
the  use  of  X-ray  ﬂuorescence  (XRF)  spectrometry  [232]  to  avoid 
the formation of pollutants in the products. From the fuel point of 
view, proximate, caloriﬁc, and elemental analyses are essential to 
understand the basic properties of biomass. In some cases such as 
biowaste or sewage sludge [233] , metal analysis including the de- 
terminations of sodium (Na), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), cal- 
cium (Ca), copper (Cu),  zinc (Zn), chromium (Cr),  lead (Pb),  and 
nickel (Ni) are also present using atomic absorption spectroscopy 
(AAS),  inductively  coupled  plasma  optical  emission  spectroscopy 
(ICP-OES), or inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP- 
MS). 

When lignocellulosic biomass is used as the feedstock, the ﬁber 
analysis,  consisting  of  the  measurements  of  cellulose,  hemicel- 
luloses,  and  lignin,  will  be  performed,  following  the  Van  Soest 
method, or ASTM E 1758-01 with Klason lignin method [234-236] . 
The torrefaction of lignocellulosic biomass is signiﬁcantly affected 
by  these  three  basic  components.  Generally,  the  motives  of  tor- 
refaction are to remove light VM in biomass which is mostly con- 
tained in hemicellulose and part of cellulose, and generate higher 
energy density products. Hence, a feedstock with higher hemicel- 

The  composition  analysis  of  algal  biomass  is  performed  to 
measure  the  contents  of  carbohydrates,  proteins,  and  lipids 
[ 190 , 238 , 239 ].  The  thermal  decomposition  behavior  of  feedstock 
is  also  a  common  analysis  that  can  be  conducted  via  a  TG 
[ 67 , 101 , 240 , 241 ]. The sample will be heated from 105 °C to an ele- 
vated temperature of about 90 0-10 0 0 °C under nitrogen or air at- 
mosphere, mostly with a ﬂow rate of 100 mL min −1 , to observe the 
pyrolysis  and  combustion  phenomenon,  respectively.  The  results 
from TG can provide useful information on feedstock for its tor- 
refaction. The aforementioned analyses for different kinds of feed- 
stocks are summarized in Table S5. 

4.2. Pretreatment 

After  receiving  the  feedstock,  several  pretreatment  processes 
can be performed to control the physical and chemical conditions 
of biomass for the subsequent torrefaction process. The basic pre- 
treatments  of  feedstock  include  drying,  grinding  or  pelletization, 
alkali and alkaline earth metals (AAEMs) impregnation, ionic so- 
lution and bio-solution treatment, leaching or water washing (or 
demineralization), 

The drying process is usually conducted by storing samples in 
an oven at temperatures of 50-105 °C for 8-24 h to remove the sur- 
face and bound water to obtain the dry-basis samples [ 60 , 224 , 237 ]. 
Drying  is  considered  as  the  major  energy  consumption  process. 
To avoid excess energy input during the drying process, volatiles 
generated from torrefaction, so-called torgas, can be combusted to 
partially supply heat for the processes of torrefaction and the pre- 
drying of biomass. The ﬂue gas can also be used to directly or in- 
directly heat biomass. The dried samples are ground by a shred- 
der or mill machine, followed by subsequent sieving to obtain de- 
sired particle sizes. Some studies already reported that the smaller 
particles are easier to undergo thermal degradation, based on bet- 
ter conductive and convective heat transfer rates from the reactor 
wall [ 161 , 242 ]. When large biomass is torreﬁed, the volatile diffu- 
sion will be constrained, and consequently, the properties of the 
derived products are non-uniform. 

18

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 82 (2021) 100887 

Pelletization  has  been  widely  used  to  increase  the  densiﬁca- 
tion of biomass since the derived pellets are easily transported and 
handled. The pelletization step was introduced as a pretreatment 
process  before  the  torrefaction  of  ﬁve  biomass  materials  (wood 
chips, coniferous barks, olive pips, straw, and pine pellets) to en- 
hance the energy density and water-resistivity of pellets [243] . The 
results  showed  that  torreﬁed  pellets  had  better  water-resistivity 
and  higher  energy  yield  ( ∼90%)  compared  to  torreﬁed  sawdust. 
Adopting pelletization prior to torrefaction could obtain higher en- 
ergy density and water-resistivity products, and even be more en- 
ergy eﬃcient [244] . 

2 CO 

The AAEMs (e.g. K, Na, Ca, and Mn) have been known for hav- 
ing catalytic effects on the thermal degradation of biomass such 
as pyrolysis and gasiﬁcation [ 183 , 245 , 246 ]. Therefore, several stud- 
ies  investigated  the  catalytic  effects  on  the  biomass  torrefaction 
by doping or impregnating methods [ 182 , 183 ]. Danish wheat straw 
and spruce wood chips were impregnated 2 wt % KCl and K 
3 , 
respectively, before the torrefaction process [182] . The TG results 
indicated that the addition of K could effectively catalyze the de- 
composition of hemicelluloses and cellulose, in terms of moving 
the degradation peaks to lower temperature. The grindability tests 
also  gave  positive  results,  in  which  the  torreﬁed  products  from 
alkali-impregnated samples had higher particle reduction than un- 
treated ones, while the enhancement of KCl-impregnated torreﬁed 
products was better than that of K 
3 -impregnated one. Shoulai- 
far et al. [183] adopted both doping and impregnating methods to 
study the catalytic effects of K, Na, Ca, or Mn on the TG torrefac- 
tion of two kinds of coniferous wood (spruce and pine), one de- 
ciduous wood (aspen), and one herbaceous biomass (miscanthus). 
A similar tendency with the aforementioned studies was reported 
that when the concentrations of K, Na, and Mn increased, the mass 
loss increased as well, whereas Ca had no obvious effect [ 182 , 183 ]. 
The tendency in hemicelluloses and cellulose degradation with in- 
creasing K concentration in biomass was also observed.

Additionally, there were studies on organic solutions (ion liq- 
uids  (ILs)  or  bio-solution)  to  pretreat  lignocellulosic  biomass 
before  torrefaction,  aiming  to  modify  the  indigenous  structure 
of  the  biomass  and  to  enhance  the  degradation  reaction.  Sar- 
varamini et al. [247] impregnated the feedstock with three kinds 
4 , and Hmim 
of imidazolium-cation based ILs (Emim OTf, Emim BF 
3 ) 
NTf 
to  avoid  the  formation  of  poisonous  emanations.  The  Emim  OTf 
and Emim BF 
4 ILs showed the effective improvement in the degra- 
dation of cellulose, due to the increasing the decomposition rate 
and  moving  the  decomposition  temperature  forward.  Conversely, 
these  ILs  had  no  noticeable  effects  on  the  degradation  of  hemi- 
celluloses and lignin. Most of the torreﬁed products from the im- 
pregnated feedstock contained higher energy densities (based on 
HHVs),  while  the  energy  yields  were  lower  compared  to  those 
without pretreatment. Bamboo was pretreated with a bio-solution 
(natural organic enzyme-7F) to improve the eﬃciency of the tor- 
refaction  process  [248] .  The  results  indicated  that  the  solution- 
treated bamboo prior to grinding could obtain better-quality tor- 
reﬁed products, due to the enhancements on the reaction rate dur- 
ing torrefaction and the energy density of the products. 

However,  the  remained  alkali  metals  (K  and  Na)  in  torreﬁed 
products would interact with silica, sulfur, or chlorine during com- 
bustion and cause slagging and fouling of the equipment [ 249 , 250 ]. 
Therefore, several studies [ 224 , 235 , 245 ] used the washing (leach- 
ing)  process  by  water  and  organic  solutions  [251]  (e.g.,  ammo- 
nium acetate, hydrochloric acid, and nitric acid) to wash the in- 
herent  metals  of  biomass  before  torrefaction,  so-called  deminer- 
alize. The ash content of all demineralized and torreﬁed products 
(1.0-10.1 wt%) decreased signiﬁcantly compared to those (3.5-13.1 
wt%) without demineralization [245] . The ash fusion behavior of 
torreﬁed products was also improved by using the washing pro- 

19 

cess. Kasim et al. [224] performed acid leaching coupled with tor- 
refaction to convert palm empty fruit bunches (EFB) into quality- 
improved solid biofuel. The results indicated that the pretreatment 
of demineralization could improve the properties of the resultant 
biofuel, in terms of the increasing mass yield, energy yield, and 
carbon content, which might be attributed to the lack of natural 
catalyst  mitigating  the  decomposition  of  the  biomass.  Moreover, 
it was observed that the demineralization effectively reduced the 
AAEMs content and oxygen content. 

4.3. Reactor 

Nowadays, torrefaction technologies are developed based on al- 
ready existing reactor concepts, designed for other processes such 
as drying, pyrolysis, or gasiﬁcation. These reactors are adopted and 
modiﬁed  for  the  torrefaction  process.  The  reactor  type  is  classi- 
ﬁed by the movement of the feedstock, the means of heat trans- 
fer, and the assisted media. The developed reactors in commercial 
companies or scale-up laboratories consist of (1) ﬁxed bed reactor; 
(2) rotary drum reactor; (3) screw reactor; (4) microwave reactor; 
(5) moving-bed reactor; and (6) others such as torbed reactor, belt 
drier, multiple hearth furnace, vibrating electrical elevator and re- 
actor (REVE), rotating-packed bed reactor, and spouted-bed reactor. 
There is no best reactor design suitable for any feedstock, hence, 
the proper selection of the reactor is essential based on the given 
feedstock. 

The ﬁxed bed reactor is a common torrefaction apparatus ( Fig. 
S4a ) used in laboratories for preliminary tests [252–254] , owing to 
its merits of simple setup and low cost. It is mainly composed of 
a glass or stainless steel cylindrical tube to put the tested sam- 
ples, a furnace to supply heat, temperature measurement devices 
like thermocouples to detect the sample and reactor temperatures, 
and a cooling unit to condense vapors or gaseous products. Nitro- 
gen  is  used  as  a  carrier  gas  to  provide  an  inert  environment  in 
the course of torrefaction, and the gas ﬂow is typically horizontal 
to blow out volatiles. Nevertheless, the disadvantages of the ﬁxed 
bed reactor involve diﬃcult sampling as well as poor heat transfer 
and temperature controlling, which limits its scalability and com- 
mercialization. 

Rotary drum dryer is a heating device with high temperatures, 
originally  used  as  the  material  heating  and  drying  equipment. 
Since the rotary drum dryer is also a type of conveying equipment, 
it is thus beneﬁcial for the development of a continuous torrefac- 
tion system, as shown in Fig. S4b . A continuous rotary drum re- 
actor system normally consists of a feeding unit by using a screw 
feeder, a rotary reactor unit heated by an external heater, and a 
product collecting unit.  Owing to the continuous rotating of the 
reactor, the conductive heat transfers between the wall and sam- 
ples, and within biomass can be achieved effectively. The rotary 
drum bed had a lower solid yield compared to convective and ﬂu- 
idized reactors when operated under the same torrefaction con- 
ditions [255] . The rotary drum bed has the disadvantages of low 
thermal eﬃciency, owing to indirect heating, less plug ﬂow, and 
limited scalability compared to other types of reactors. 

A screw-type reactor, also called auger reactor, is a proven tech- 
nology mainly composed of one or more auger screws transporting 
the feedstock through the reactor ( Fig. S4c ), which is also consid- 
ered as a continuous reactor. Indirect heating is a typical method 
adopted in this type of reactor by using a medium inside the hol- 
low  wall  or  hollow  screw.  Direct  heating  has  been  investigated 
recently with various concepts to enhance its thermal eﬃciency. 
Concerning  the  operation  of  torrefaction  with  the  screw  reactor, 
several  crucial  parameters  need  to  be  considered,  including  the 
degree of ﬁlling, screw frequencies, and residence time. Improper 
controlling conditions may cause the blockage of the process ow-

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 82 (2021) 100887 

ing to the agglomeration of particles and poor-qualities products 
[ 256 , 257 ]. 

Microwave  torrefaction  reactors  ( Fig.  S4d )  use  the  high- 
frequency  electromagnetic  irradiation,  for  blasting  the  water 
molecules or dielectric materials inside biomass and resulting in 
an increase of their internal energy or temperature. The microwave 
reactor  employs  electromagnetic  waves,  which  can  operate  at  a 
speciﬁc frequency range of 300 MHz to 300 GHz. There are two 
main  mechanisms  to  describe  electromagnetic  microwave  radia- 
tion:  dipolar  polarization  and  ionic  migration.  Typical  industrial 
microwave  reactors  usually  operate  at  a  frequency  of  2.45  GHz, 
which has been proven to be both effective and relatively achiev- 
able. The microwave reactor is different from other reactors that 
utilize  direct  heating.  In  a  direct  heating  system,  by  contrast, 
biomass  is  heated  externally,  such  that  heat  from  the  heat  car- 
rier  (gas,  solid,  liquid,  or  reactor  wall)  initially  contacts  the  sur- 
face of the particles and then is conducted into their center. This 
mode of heating is less eﬃcient because biomass is a poor thermal 
conductor, whereas the microwave heating occurs simultaneously 
throughout the samples. The microwave irradiation produces eﬃ- 
cient internal heating of biomass particles, while the heating de- 
pends on the ability of the materials absorbing the impinged mi- 
crowaves. Generally, the power adopted in microwave-assisted tor- 
refaction of various feedstocks is ranging from 150 to 400 W, corre- 
sponding to the heating rates within 10 to 135 °C min −1 [258–260] . 
However, the heating rate of the torrefaction process will be con- 
trolled below 50 °C min −1  to avoid insuﬃcient reaction time and 
non-uniform products. 

The moving-bed reactor has advantages of compact and simple 
design, as well as a high heat transfer rate via the heat-carrying 
gaseous medium, as displayed in Fig. S4e . Biomass particles enter 
a hopper at the top of the reactor and are fed in by the control of a 
screw conveyor, while the heating gas ﬂows counter-currently from 
the bottom of the reactor to heat the feedstock [261] . The feed- 
stock is subsequently treated by drying and torrefaction along the 
temperature gradient of the vertical column. The ﬂow rate of the 
feedstock and the reaction duration will inﬂuence the height of the 
column. With the optimized conditions, the short residence time 
can be achieved. Owing to the high ﬁll percentage of the moving- 
bed reactor, the pressure drop is severe compared to other types 
of reactors. It is thus essential to consider the operating cost of 
the blower in optimizing the process design when a moving-bed 
reactor is chosen. 

The toroidal bed reactor ( Fig. S4f ), abbreviated as Torbed reac- 
tor, was developed and patented by Torftech cooperation. Typically, 
this technology has merits of accurate control of processes requir- 
ing gas-solid contact and higher temperatures than those experi- 
enced in conventional equipment. The principle of a Torbed reac- 
tor is the toroidal ﬂow of the bed which has a refractory-lined and 
insulated chamber. Heat is carried via a gaseous medium which 
is blown in from the bottom of the reactor at a high velocity (50 
to 80 m s −1 ) passing stationary angled blades. The injection an- 
gles result in a ﬂow with a horizontal and vertical velocity vector, 
which lifts and moves the feedstock in a horizontal motion at the 
same time. The toroidal motion allows a higher gas speed, which 
reduces the boundary layer between solid particles and gas. Owing 
to its high heat transfer rate and well mixing of the feedstock, the 
reaction duration of the Torbed reactor (around 80 s) is far shorter 
than that of other types of reactors. Therefore, it can provide novel 
and cost-effective means for processing a very wide variety of dif- 
ferent materials. 

The  multiple  hearth  furnace  consists  of  a  series  of  circular 
hearths placed one above the other and enclosed in a refractory- 
lined steel shell, as shown in Fig. S4g . The system can be divided 
into a drying zone and a torrefaction zone. Biomass is dried in the 
drying zone utilizing a drying  gas ﬂow  and subsequently  is tor- 

reﬁed  in  the  torrefaction  zone.  In  this  process,  part  of  the  dry- 
ing gas ﬂow containing water vapor is discharged from the drying 
zone and heated in a heat exchanger and then at least partially 
returned to the drying zone. Furthermore, part of the torrefaction 
gas ﬂow evolved in the torrefaction zone is discharged from the 
torrefaction zone and fed to a combustion assembly for combus- 
tion. The resulting exhaust gas is used to heat the drying gas ﬂow 
in the heat exchanger and is introduced into the torrefaction zone. 
Biomass is stirred and moved in a spiral path across each hearth 
by  a  vertical  rotating  shaft  that  goes  through  the  center  of  the 
furnace.  Biomass  is  fed  to  the  top  hearth,  passing  across  it  and 
then, through the drop holes to the hearth below with the tem- 
perature gradually increases one layer after another from 200 to 
300 °C. Biomass passes continuously over and across each hearth 
to the bottom of the furnace where the product is collected. 

A robust, simple, and modern technology, REVE (as shown in 
Fig.  S4h ),  modiﬁed  from  the  concept  of  roasting  various  food 
ingredients  such  as  peanuts,  barley,  or  soya  was  developed  by 
REVTECH. Few studies have presented the application of this in- 
tegrated  technology  with  high  capacity  in  biomass  torrefaction 
[ 243 , 262 ].  Four  types  of  biomass  (wood  chips,  pine  barks,  olive 
pips, and straw) were torreﬁed under temperatures between 240 °C 
and 300 °C, residence time up to 30 min, and mass ﬂow rate be- 
tween 10 to 140 kg h −1  [262] . The elemental analysis, HHV, and 
grindability of torreﬁed products were performed to evaluate the 
feasibility of this technology. Due to the plug-ﬂow, homogeneous 
heating, and well-mixing characteristics of the REVE, the obtained 
products had good uniformity, improved grindability, and high en- 
ergy yields with 68.6 to 89.4%. 

A  novel concept of  reactor  design, rotating packed  bed (RPB) 
has been proposed to enhance the mass transfer of the reactants 
during the treatment, which has two main advantages: (1) increas- 
ing centrifugal force to obtain a high gravity (Higee) environment 
and (2) the elongated path of the carrier gas in the RPB. Pillejera 
et al. [263] ﬁrst adopted RPB in the bamboo torrefaction process 
as displayed in Fig. S4i . The bamboo was torreﬁed with three tem- 
peratures (206, 255, and 300 °C) at a ﬁxed holding time (30 min). 
Three different rotating speeds (0, 900, and 1800 rpm) were con- 
ducted in the RPB reactor, which could correspond to the dimen- 
sionless G number of 0, 58, and 234, respectively. The G number 
could quantify the average centrifugal force (g) for each rotating 
speeds (rpm) [264] . The results showed that the G number has a 
signiﬁcant inﬂuence in the solid yield, enhancement factor (EF) of 
HHV, and energy yield of the torreﬁed products for the temper- 
atures of 206 and 255 °C. On the contrary, the effect of G num- 
ber on these quantities was slight when the process operated un- 
der  300 °C.  It  was  explained  that  the  inﬂuence  coming  from  the 
high temperature was greater than the force induced by the rotor, 
hence, implied that there existed a threshold value for the increase 
or decrease in torrefaction parameters at varying temperature and 
rotating speed. 

The spouted bed is originally developed to strengthen the gas- 
solid contact with coarse particles and has been extensively ap- 
plied to biomass pyrolysis and gasiﬁcation [ 265 , 266 ]. The spouted 
bed is capable of handling large ( > 1 mm) particles such as typi- 
cal biomass particles. Moreover, spouted bed reactors can provide 
excellent particle-particle and particle-ﬂuid heat transfer. The SRSB 
reactor, as shown in Fig. S4j , is relatively easy to scale up com- 
pared to conventional spouted beds. Its potential applications in a 
torrefaction process owing to the excellent gas-solid heat and mass 
transfer  performance  [267] .  In  their  study,  the  sawdust  particles 
were torreﬁed in an SRSB torrefaction reactor at four temperatures 
(240, 270, 300, and 330 °C), three feeding rates (220, 440, and 710 
g h -1 ), and a residence time of 50 min. The results found that the 
weight loss increased from14.2% to 29.4% when the temperature 
was raised from 240 to 330 °C. This increase was associated with 

20 

W.-H. Chen, B.-J. Lin, Y.-Y. Lin et al. 

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 82 (2021) 100887 

a greater degree of devolatilization at higher temperatures. Higher 
weight loss was also obtained at a lower feed rate because of the 
longer residence time of the biomass particles. In contrast, a higher 
feed rate led to a less vigorous movement of the biomass particles 
owing to biomass accumulation in the reactor. This could also have 
affected the heat transfer rate and resulted in a lower weight loss. 
Based on the introduced reactors, their advantages, disadvantages, 
and current situations are summarized in Table S6. 

4.4. Post-treatment 

When the torrefaction of the feedstock is completed, the reactor 
will subsequently undergo the cooling step, usually cooled down 
to below 80 °C under an inert atmosphere to avoid the self-ignition 
and  combustion  of  the  solid  products.  The  resultant  products  of 
torrefaction including gaseous, liquid (condensate), solid products, 
and tar will be collected. The solid products can be post-treated to 
enhance their fuel properties. The main post-treatment of torreﬁed 
solid product is densiﬁcation by pelletization, aiming to promote 
it as a promising biofuel in terms of transportation, storage, and 
handling. Additionally, the enhanced energy density of pelletized 
torrefaction products can be utilized in co-combustion with coal. 
Using pelletization as a post-treatment of torreﬁed products has 
been studied by the Energy Research Centre for the Netherlands 
(ECN)  in  2005,  and  it  proposed  a  TOP  (torrefaction  and  pelleti- 
zation) process. Afterward, several related studies were performed 
successively [ 132 , 161 , 244 , 268 , 269 ]. 

A single pellet press or pellet mill can be applied to produce 
torreﬁed  pellets.  Owing  to  the  low  water  content  ( < 1%)  of  tor- 
reﬁed products, preconditioning by adding water content (5-13%) 
or  binder  to  samples  was  usually  adopted  before  pelletization. 
Generally, around 0.5-1 g of samples are pelletized into one pel- 
let under die temperatures of 70-170 °C, compression of 125-300 
MPa, and holding times of 10-60 s. Additionally, particle size, tor- 
reﬁed  feedstock,  and  remained  constituents  (hemicelluloses,  cel- 
lulose,  and  lignin)  will  also  affect  the  performance  of  pelletiza- 
tion. Peng et al. [161] performed torrefaction (temperatures of 250 
and 300 °C; residence times of 15 and 30 min) and further pelleti- 
zation  with  three  particle  sizes  of  pine  sawdust  (0.23  mm,  0.67 
mm, and 0.81 mm). The densiﬁcation analysis indicated that the 
pellet  derived  from  greater  particle  sizes  had  higher  water  con- 
tent, Meyer hardness, and energy consumption. The pellets from 
wheat  straw  torreﬁed  at  a  higher  temperature  (300 °C)  had  un- 
favorable properties of poor mechanical stability and lower den- 
sity compared to those obtained from lower torrefaction temper- 
atures [269] , which was also observed in other studies with dif- 
ferent kinds of feedstocks [ 132 , 161 , 268 ]. This phenomenon, spring 
back effect, may stem from the greater reduction in intermolecular 
bonding and available hydrogen bonding under severe torrefaction 
[ 270 , 271 ]. Moreover, the static friction showed a vigorous increase 
during the compression of torreﬁed samples when the torrefaction 
temperature  increased  to  300 °C  [ 269 , 270 ],  which  indicated  that 
energy consumption would also increase [244] . 

To overcome the drawback of torreﬁed products, the addition of 
binder and increasing die temperature had been adopted to pro- 
mote  the  properties  of  the  torreﬁed  pellets.  Increasing  die  tem- 
perature from 170 to 230 °C could enhance the density of the tor- 
reﬁed pellets comparable with untreated pellets [132] . The energy 
consumption  for  compression  of  torreﬁed  pellets  would  be  50% 
higher than that of untreated pellets. Ghiasi et al. [244] applied a 7 
wt% binder (wheat ﬂour) with torreﬁed products (Douglas ﬁr wood 
chips)  for  subsequent  pelletization.  The  results  showed  that  the 
supplementary of the binder could reduce the energy consumption 
of torreﬁed pellets from 1164 to 461 kJ kg −1 , which was even lower 
than that of untreated pellets. However, some studies used a high 
level of binders, which did not meet the guidelines ( < 4%) of the 

International Organization for Standardization (ISO) [ 132 , 272 , 273 ]. 
The lower bulk density and durability were also found in starch- 
type binders, which would lower the qualities of pellets. Therefore, 
further development of these shortcomings is required to acceler- 
ate the commercialized path. 

5. Applications and commercialization 

5.1. Applications of torreﬁed biomass 

5.1.1. Co-ﬁring and combustion 

Studies  have  shown  the  potential  fuel  acted  by  torreﬁed 
biomass  for  ﬁring  and  co-ﬁring  with  coal  in  existing  large-scale 
facilities such as pulverized coal boilers [ 274 , 275 ]. From the view- 
point of sustainable development, net CO 
2 emissions could be sig- 
niﬁcantly abated by consuming biomass in co-ﬁring systems [276] . 
Li et al. [277] employed a CFD model to simulate the co-ﬁring of 
coal and torreﬁed biomass in a pulverized coal boiler. Five different 
torreﬁed biomass proportions of 0% (coal only), 25%, 50%, 75%, and 
100% on a thermal basis were taken into account. They reported 
that 100% torreﬁed biomass could be ﬁred in the boiler, without 
causing an obvious reduction in the eﬃciency and ﬂuctuation in 
boiler load. In the study of Xue [278] , they indicated that the co- 
ﬁring of torreﬁed biomass reduced fuel segregation compared with 
the co-ﬁring of raw biomass, and this was mainly stemming from 
the more combustion  heat and higher reactivity  of the  torreﬁed 
material. Meanwhile, the thermal oxidation behavior of torreﬁed 
biomass was similar to coal combustion, resulting from the reduc- 
tion of the H/C ratio in the torreﬁed biomass. 

2  emissions  (the  measurements  were  based  on  a  6%  O 

Lasek  et  al.  [279]  examined  the  combustion  of  torreﬁed  wil- 
low  in  a  bubbling  ﬂuidized-bed  combustor.  They  revealed  low 
SO 
2  con- 
centration) level during the combustion of the torreﬁed biomass. 
This  observation  was  mainly  ascribed  to  the  low  sulfur  content 
in the torreﬁed biomass. According to their results, the SO 
2  con- 
centrations in the ﬂue gas generated from the combustion of tor- 
reﬁed willow, Polish lignite, and Polish hard coal were 2, 293, and 
1184 ppm, respectively. Ohlemüller et al. [280] studied a 1 MWth 
pilot  plant  coupled  with  chemical  looping  combustion  (CLC)  of 
hard coal and torreﬁed biomass. During their co-combustion (coal: 
biomass = 50/50),  the  total  carbon  capture  eﬃciency  ( η
CC )  could 
reach 66%, leading to a 122% CO 
2 reduction when considering car- 
bon from the coal. 

5.1.2. Gasiﬁcation 

Biomass gasiﬁcation is a potential thermal process in which the 
feedstock is converted into a gas product in an oxygen-starved en- 
vironment where synthesis gas or syngas, namely, H 
2  and CO, is 
the main products [ 281 , 282 ]. On account of the improved prop- 
erties of torreﬁed biomass such as higher caloriﬁc value and lower 
volatile content, the gasiﬁcation eﬃciency can be improved and tar 
formation can be lowed [283] . 

Chen  et  al.  [281]  adopted  numerical  simulations  to  compare 
the gasiﬁcation of raw bamboo, torreﬁed bamboo, and coal in an 
entrained-ﬂow reactor. The most appropriate equivalence ratio (ER) 
values for the gasiﬁcation of raw bamboo, torreﬁed bamboo, and 
coal were shown to be 0.692, 0.434, and 0.357, respectively. The 
cold gas eﬃciency of torreﬁed bamboo (54.52%) under the opti- 
mum  conditions  was  higher  than  that  of  raw  bamboo  (28.98%) 
by a factor of 88%, and the gasiﬁcation performance of torreﬁed 
biomass  was  closer  to  that  of  coal  (80.82%)  when  compared  to 
that of raw bamboo. It was thus summarized that torrefaction is a 
promising technique to improve the properties of biomass for en- 
hancing gasiﬁcation performance. Yang et al. [284] studied the co- 
gasiﬁcation of Eucalyptus globulus and torreﬁed Spirulina platensis

pellets in a bubbling ﬂuidized bed reactor. The two samples per- 
tained to woody biomass and microalgal biomass respectively, the 
capacity of the reactor was 30 kW. They discovered that the H 
2 
and CH 
4 concentrations in the product gas initially decreased fol- 
lowed by slightly increased with increasing mass ratio of the tor- 
reﬁed microalgal pellet. On the other hand, the inverse tendency 
was exhibited for the CO concentration of the product gas and its 
LHV. Huang et al. [285] evaluated the syngas production from the 
co-gasiﬁcation of wet sewage sludge and torreﬁed birch. They re- 
vealed that the use of torreﬁed birch under high torrefaction sever- 
4  production, and gave rise to the de- 
ity led to high H 
crease in CO 
2 from 
wet  sewage  sludge  and  torreﬁed  birch  co-gasiﬁcation  was  32.17 
mol kg −1 at 1100 K.

Zhang et al. [286] examined the co-gasiﬁcation of coal and tor- 
reﬁed biomass (woody wastes and agricultural residue) in CO 
2 and 
the synergy between the coal and torreﬁed biomass by a thermo- 
2  gasiﬁcation  reac- 
gravimetric  analyzer.  They  found  that  the  CO 
tion  of  the  torreﬁed  biomass  was  substantially  higher  than  that 
of  the  parent  biomass.  Compared  to  the  coal  and  raw  biomass 
blends, the co-gasiﬁcation of the blends had higher synergy. Kuo 
et al. [287] examined the inﬂuence of the calcium looping (CaL) 
process on the co-gasiﬁcation of torreﬁed bamboo and coal in a 
power plant. Two different schemes (pre- and post-CaL) were in- 
vestigated,  and  the  results  suggested  that  the  pre-CaL  case  was 
suitable to design a process for co-generating hydrogen and elec- 
2  emissions. In 
tricity with a higher eﬃciency along with low CO 
the post-CaL, the CO 
2 capture eﬃciency could reach 93-97%, which 
was higher than that of the pre-CaL (86-91%), thus concluding that 
the post-CaL case could provide an approach for a co-gasiﬁcation 
power plant having nearly zero CO 

2 emissions. 

5.1.3. Pyrolysis 

Recently,  torrefaction  is  considered  as  an  eﬃcient  alterna- 
tive  pretreatment  method  for  pyrolysis-derived  bio-oil  produc- 
tion  [ 288 , 289 ].  Bio-oils  produced  from  the  pyrolysis  of  torreﬁed 
biomass contain lower water content and higher carbon content 
than those from raw biomass pyrolysis [290] . Bu et al. [291] ex- 
amined  the  co-pyrolysis  of  low-density  polyethylene  (LDPE)  and 
torreﬁed rice straw by microwave heating. They reported that the 
bio-oils from the torreﬁed biomass had a lower water content, and 
the main compositions in the bio-oil were phenols, ketones, hydro- 
carbons, esters, and alcohols. Louwes et al. [292] investigated the 
fast pyrolysis of torreﬁed hardwood. The underlined that though 
the bio-oil yield signiﬁcantly decreased from 44 wt% (raw mate- 
rial)  to  31  wt%  (treated  material),  the  bio-oil  obtained  from  the 
torreﬁed biomass presented higher quality in terms of oxygen con- 
tent, decreasing from 45.7 to 37.2 wt%), and HHV, increasing from 
19.1 to 23.1 MJ kg −1 ) when compared with the bio-oil from virgin 
biomass. Chen et al. [293] investigated the two-stage thermodegra- 
dation of hemicelluloses, cellulose, and lignin to evaluate the effect 
of torrefaction on pyrolytic products. According to the Py-GC/MS 
analysis, the analysis revealed that inherent pentose units and O- 
acetyl of hemicelluloses were decomposed into furfural and acetic 
acid during torrefaction, and therefore the pyrolysis bio-oil of tor- 
reﬁed hemicelluloses contained lower acetic acid and furfural con- 
tents. In contrast, the inﬂuence of torrefaction upon cellulose was 
insigniﬁcant,  due  to  the  high  thermal  stability  of  the  crystalline 
structure in the cellulose. As for lignin, a pronounced inﬂuence on 
its pyrolysis was observed when lignin underwent severe torrefac- 
tion at 300 °C, resulting in an increase in aromatic compounds in 
the course of pyrolysis. In summary, pyrolysis-derived bio-oils from 
torreﬁed  biomass  are  normally  characterized  by  lower  organic 
acids, furfural, and aldehydes as well as higher hydrocarbons, phe- 
nols, furans, ketones, aromatic, anhydrous sugars, aliphatic groups, 
and carbonaceous residues [294] . 

22 

5.1.4. Ironmaking 

The  iron  and  steel  industry  consumes  about  20%  of  the  an- 
nual  industrial  energy  requirements  and  constitutes  6.7%  of  the 
2  emissions [30] . Because of that, improving energy ef- 
global CO 
ﬁciency and reducing CO 
2 emissions during ironmaking processes 
have been covered extensively in recent years [295] . To avoid the 
excessive usage of fossil fuels, biomass is a potential alternative to 
coal in iron ore agglomeration, metallurgical coke production, and 
pulverized coal injection in the tuyeres of blast furnaces [296] . 

The blast furnace is the most crucial and commonly employed 
facility  to  produce  hot  metal  in  the  ironmaking  industry  [113] . 
High-quality coke is normally used as the reducing agent for the 
direct reduction process of iron oxides to produce pig iron in the 
blast furnace [9] . In the study of Proskurina et al. [297] , they re- 
ported that it was possible to use torreﬁed biomass for replacing 
coal in pulverized coal injection (150-200 kg ton −1 hot metal) for 
the production of iron. Wang et al. [298] simulated the replace- 
2 re- 
ment of pulverized coal by biomass into blast furnaces for CO 
duction.  They estimated 115.7 GWh year −1  of energy saving po- 
tential and 6.4% of CO 
2 reduction by torreﬁed biomass. Chen et al. 
[113] discovered that biochar produced torrefaction at the temper- 
ature of 300 °C was quite comparable with the high-volatile bitu- 
minous coal used in blast furnaces for ironmaking. Ubando et al. 
[299] analyzed iron oxide reduction by graphite and torreﬁed for- 
est residue through TG. They found that the iron oxides reduced 
by  the  torreﬁed  biomass  were  more  pronounced  in  the  low-to 
medium-range temperatures with an onset temperature of 300 °C, 
while the iron ore reduction by graphite occurred at temperatures 
higher than 950 °C). This work was later on expanded by Ubando 
et al. [296] who evaluated the use of torreﬁed microalgal biomass 
as a reducing agent in ironmaking. Their results indicate that the 
use of torreﬁed microalgal biomass has lowered the initiating re- 
duction  temperature  of  iron  oxides  when  compared  with  other 
biomass-based reductants. 

5.1.5. Adsorbent for pollutants 

Biochar recently is regarded as an environmentally-friendly and 
sustainable material for removing inorganic and organic pollutants 
[ 300 , 301 ]. Meanwhile, the use of biochar to adsorb contaminants 
is  more  cost-saving  compared  to  conventional  adsorbents  with 
higher costs [57] . The performance of biochar in contaminant ad- 
sorption depends on its physicochemical properties such as speciﬁc 
surface area, pore sizes, surface functional chemistry (e.g., -OH, - 
CH, and C = C), and the mineral content in ash [ 300 , 302 ]. 

De Jesus [303] evaluated the adsorption performances of two 
different  torreﬁed  biomass  materials  (coconut  waste  and  or- 
ange  waste)  to  remove  polycyclic  aromatic  hydrocarbons  (PAHs). 
The  adsorption  tests  were  examined  using  a  mixed  solution  of 
benzo(k)ﬂuoranthene,  benzo( a )anthracene,  benzo( b )ﬂuoranthene, 
and benzo( a )pyrene, dibenzo(a,h) anthracene, abbreviated by BkF, 
BaA, BbF, BaP, and DahA, respectively. Their results indicated that 
the removal percentages of PAHs by torreﬁed coconut waste and 
orange  waste  were  47.09-83.02%  and  23.84-84.02%,  respectively. 
Abdelhadi et al. [219] produced biochar from olive mill solid waste 
(OMSW) torreﬁed at 350 °C and 450 °C for heavy metal (HM) re- 
moval.  The  biochar  yield  was  24–35%  with  surface  area  in  the 
range  of  1.65-8.12  m 2  g −1 .  They  pointed  out  that  the  OMSW 
biochar demonstrated high HM removal performance which was 
better than that of commercial activated carbon (CAC). The removal 
eﬃciencies of lead and copper by CAC were 54% and 74% respec- 
tively, while the eﬃciencies for other HMs were less than 30%. For 
HM removal by the biochar, the removal eﬃciencies of Pb and Cu 
were greater than 80% and lower than 20% for selenium (Se) re- 
moval. 

Li et al. [302] evaluated the performance of torrefaction char 
(TC) adsorption for methylene blue (MB) and uranium (U(VI)) re- 

W.-H. Chen, B.-J. Lin, Y.-Y. Lin et al. 

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 82 (2021) 100887 

moval. The results suggested that the maximum U(VI) and MB ad- 
sorption capacities by the TC were greater than 100 mg g −1  and 
350 mg g −1 , respectively. They also found that the adsorption per- 
formance of the TC would be affected by the torrefaction atmo- 
sphere. The MB adsorption was more profound when employing 
TC from N 
2 , whereas the U(VI) adsorption was more pronounced 
when using TC from air. They also suggested that the TC was a 
promising material for water pollution control because of the low 
treatment  temperature,  simple  preparation,  and  high  adsorption 
capacity. 

5.2. Commercialization 

To move the torrefaction system forward into the market, the 
applications of patents are one of the essential paces to safeguard 
the invention against other companies. According to the statistics 
of  the  European  patent  oﬃce  (EPO)  from  1  January  1970  to  21 
January 2020, there were already 393 torrefaction-related patents 
published worldwide. It can be observed that vigorous growth oc- 
curred since 2007. Europe (EU) has most publications with 158, ac- 
counting for 51% of total publications, while the United States (US) 
ranked second with 106 publications (34%). Regarding the inven- 
tion patent, the US has the most publications with 93, followed 
by China and Canada having 31 and 27 publications, respectively. 
Concluding the invention patent by continent, North America has 
120 patents, followed by the EU and Asia where they both have 31 
patents. 

On  the  other  hand,  the  techno-economic  analysis  is  required 
to evaluate the feasibility of the entire system in terms of perfor- 
mance, costs, beneﬁt, risk, and uncertainty. In addition, price sta- 
bility and predictability are important to mitigate risks related to 
investments that are required for torreﬁed pellet production. 

Svanberg  et  al.  [304]  proposed  a  techno-economic  system 
model to analyze the costs of the torrefaction supply chain under 
Swedish conditions. The model was constructed by four parts: (1) 
a supply system to a torrefaction plant; (2) a complete energy and 
mass balance of drying, torrefaction, heat generation, and densi- 
ﬁcation; (3) capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operating expendi- 
tures (OPEX); and (4) a distribution system to the gate of an end- 
user (combined heat and power plant, CHP). Their results showed 
that the cost for the entire supply chain was 31.8 €/MWh 
LHV un- 
der the base case of 200 kton 
DS /year torrefaction plant, where the 
supply system contributed 59.5% of the system cost, the produc- 
tion cost to pellets accounted for 31.0%, and the distribution sys- 
tem for only 9.48%. The analysis of the scale-up suggested that the 
production system had higher cost reduction (50% reduction) than 
that of the distribution system (16.5% reduction) when increasing 
the torrefaction plant size from 25 kton 
DS /year. 
It was also found that even a highly eﬃcient setup of a drying sys- 
tem still consumed lots of heat and thus contributed to the highest 
costs in the production system. However, the costs of the distribu- 
tion system were much lower among the entire system, resulted 
from the higher energy density of torreﬁed densiﬁed biomass be- 
ing  more  eﬃcient  during  transportation  and  handling  [ 244 , 305 ]. 
The sensitivity analysis showed that the profound-effect parame- 
ters consisted of the amount of biomass, biomass premium, for- 
warding, and transportation cost, biomass moisture content, drying 
system, and mass yield. 

DS /year to 200 kton 

Thrän et al. [306] adopted the BioChainS tool (Biomass-to-end- 
use Chain Simulation tool) to evaluate the production costs of tor- 
reﬁed wood pellets against the raw wood pellets. The simulation 
displayed that the larger production plant (50 0,0 0 0 Mg a −1 ) fed 
with cheaper biomass feedstock (15 MWh −1 ) could achieve lower 
production costs of 29 € MWh −1 compared to the base condition 
operated under production plant with 72,800 t a −1 output density. 
Furthermore, the annual cost of co-ﬁring of coal with 30 wt% tor- 

reﬁed pellets (2-3 M € a −1 ) was much lower than that of coal with 
30 wt% raw wood pellets (12-13 M € a −1 ), implying that large-scale 
production plants coupled with co-ﬁring with coal could achieve 
economical utilization of torreﬁed pellets. 

Chai et al. [307] optimized the production costs of three bio- 
fuels, including conventional pellets, moderately torreﬁed pellets, 
and severely torreﬁed pellets in terms of the depot capacity and 
biomass  moisture  capacity.  The  optimized  production  costs  for 
three cases were between 7.03-7.17 US$/GJ 
LHV with depot capacity 
between 82-92 MW 
LHV . It was found that the production costs had 
no signiﬁcant difference among the three scenarios when increas- 
ing the capacities beyond 60 MW. The optimized biomass moisture 
contents ranged from 32 to 40 wt%, depending on the demand for 
biomass or its derived combustible gas used for drying and tor- 
refying biomass. The results also indicated that the biomass cost, 
consisting of the ﬁeld price of biomass, mass loss during on-site 
drying, and interest costs incurred during on-site drying, accounted 
for the most cost of the total production costs, which was consis- 
tent with the study of Svanberg et al. [304] . 

Agar et al. [308] compared the production costs of torreﬁed pel- 
lets and conventional pellets by integrating the economic analysis 
with the results of the literature. The results showed that the an- 
nual production cost of the torreﬁed pellets (6.11 M €) was less than 
that of conventional pellets (7.05 M €), while the speciﬁc costs of 
torreﬁed pellets (95.54 € t −1 ) were less than that of conventional 
pellets (88.09 € t −1 ). The crucial parameters affecting the tow pro- 
cesses were loan amortization, utilities, logistics, and transport. Re- 
garding the sensitivity results, the study suggested that (1) invest- 
ment costs must be reduced by more than 17%; (2) the LHV (as 
received) of pellets must be improved by more than 8%; and (3) 
the bulk density (as received) must be improved. In the overview 
of the techno-economic analysis, the costs of torreﬁed pellets are 
getting close to raw wood pellets, indicating that it will be a com- 
parative product in the fuel market. The economic analysis of the 
torrefaction processes introduced above is summarized in Table S7. 
The  commercial  development  of  torrefaction  is  in  its  early 
phase. Several technology companies and their industrial partners 
are moving towards commercial market introduction, which can be 
found in Table S8). The general view is that most of the demon- 
stration  plants  have  technical  problems  that  have  delayed  their 
commercial operation. Several thousand tonnes of torreﬁed pellets 
have been produced by European and US companies, mainly for 
large scale co-ﬁring tests at coal power plants. 

6. Environmental performance 

Torrefaction has gained much attention not only due to the in- 
herent beneﬁts of upgrading biomass but also because of its sus- 
tainability advantages. Much of which can be accounted through 
the  environmental  impacts  generated  from  the  life-cycle  of  tor- 
reﬁed biomass from cultivation to processing up and combustion, 
as shown in Fig. 14 . The environmental impact evaluation of tor- 
refaction for different biomass feedstocks is essential to reduce the 
underlying impact of the process and its supply chain. The result- 
ing assessment and recommendations lead to the sound strategic 
design of the production of bioenergy products. 

6.1. Life cycle assessment 

Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a known methodology for identi- 
fying the environmental impacts of systems and products. LCA was 
developed in conformance with the International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO) standards [ 309 , 310 ] that consist of four main 
stages.  Firstly,  the  goal  and  system  boundary  deﬁnition provides 
information  on  the  functional  unit  and  the  scope  of  the  assess- 
ment. Secondly, the inventory of the system or known as the life-

had  the  highest  energy  and  carbon  abatement  costs.  Thus,  their 
work  presented  the  trade-offs  between  the  various  NETs.  In  ad- 
dition,  torrefaction  using  lignocellulosic  biomass  to  produce  tor- 
reﬁed biomass has resulted in a high technology readiness level 
which indicated a high large-scale adoption. An evaluation of the 
potential inﬂuence of the introduction of sustainability criteria for 
pelletized biomass (including torreﬁed biomass) on the European 
Union and its market was administered [313] . The assessment was 
focused on the reduction of greenhouse gas emission of biomass 
pellets  consumed  in  Sweden.  Various  wood  pellet  value  chains 
which included torreﬁed biomass were assessed. The results have 
shown  that  torreﬁed  biomass  pellets  had  a  slightly  higher  GWP 
compared to conventional biomass. However, the GWP impact of 
transporting the pellets to the consumers have been offsetted by 
the  improved  heating  value  of  the  torreﬁed  biomass  pellets.  To 
date, no studies have reviewed and compared various LCAs of var- 
ious torreﬁed bioenergy products based on the bibliometric analy- 
sis of the scientiﬁc papers found in the Scopus search. The study 
presents the various assumptions used in these studies and their 
environmental impacts. 

The various LCA studies on torrefaction are summarized in Ta- 
ble S9. Most of the studies focused on lignocellulosic biomass, ex- 
cept for a study [314] which evaluated the environmental impact 
of torreﬁed microalgal biomass. The LCA study on the torreﬁed mi- 
croalgal biomass was later on extended by a review work [311] to 
compare with other lignocellulosic biomass processed with other 
thermochemical processes such as gasiﬁcation, hydrothermal liq- 
uefaction, and pyrolysis. Few studies have focused on the torrefac- 
tion of microalgal biomass, thus presenting opportunities for fu- 
ture LCA evaluation. The majority of the studies shown in Table 
S10 have produced torreﬁed biomass which was used as a solid 
fuel for combustion to generate electricity or processed heat. Most 
of these studies have employed a cradle-to-gate system boundary 
and have considered performing a sensitivity analysis, however, ig- 
noring the allocation and uncertainty analysis. 

The supply-chain of torreﬁed biomass is shown in Fig. 15 . From 
the forest, the forest residues and chippings are transported to the 
torrefaction facility for drying and torrefaction. Once the biomass 
has been dried and torreﬁed, the torreﬁed biomass is stored and 
transported to the industrial plant or power plant for combustion 
to generate either electricity or process heat. As shown in Fig. 15 ,

and  a  negative  emission  effect  in  the  supply-chain  of  torreﬁed 
biomass.  The  LCA  framework  of  the  torreﬁed  biomass  is  shown 
based on the majority of the studies reviewed as shown in Table 
S9.

6.3. Greenhouse gas emissions 

The  functional  unit  and  the  resulting  greenhouse  gas  emis- 
sion  impact  of  the  studies  can  be  found  in  Appendix  materials. 
The  majority  of  the  studies  have  utilized  energy  as  a  basis  for 
the functional unit of the LCA work such as electricity produced 
and  energy  content  of  the  torreﬁed  biomass.  With  the  disparity 
of the functional units for each study, it remained a challenge to 
compare the different studies conducted on various biomass feed- 
stocks. This includes the different assum ptions em ployed, supply- 
chain  considered,  and  torrefaction  technologies  and  settings  uti- 
lized  for  each  study.  The  LCA  review  [311]  attempted  to  com- 
pare the global warming potential (GWP) impact of the numerous 
LCA studies on torreﬁed biomass with other bioenergy products of 
thermochemical processes. The GWP index represents the equiva- 
lent impact of a certain greenhouse gas to that of CO 
2 , allowing 
the comparison of the greenhouse effect [315] . The results of the 
impact on torreﬁed biomass yielded a GWP impact which ranged

cycle inventory (LCI) which involves a comprehensive accounting 
of all material and energy ﬂows of the processes involved in the 
system of interest. In addition, the ﬂow streams tracked in the LCI 
include raw material, products, co-products, and emissions. Thirdly, 
the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) quantiﬁes the impacts on 
the ﬂow streams of each process stage. The LCIA provides an im- 
pact value to the required ﬂow streams to produce the functional 
unit.  The  allocation  of  impact  weights  for  the  product  and  the 
co-products is decided in the LCIA stage. Characterization factors 
are deﬁned to convert the outputs of the LCI to impact categories 
that represent the environmental burden. Lastly, the interpretation 
stage allows the systematic evaluation of the results from the LCI 
and LCIA stages through identiﬁcation, quantiﬁcation, and valida- 
tion. The interpretation stage provides evaluators to establish con- 
ﬁdence with the derived results, which is then communicated in a 
sound and accurate manner. The four stages of the LCA methodol- 
ogy can be redeﬁned interactively by varying the system boundary 
and by performing a sensitivity analysis. 

6.2. State-of-the-art 

A bibliometric analysis through Scopus was performed (Decem- 
ber 4, 2019) to assess the available articles on the life-cycle assess- 
ment of torrefaction. The bibliometric analysis was processed using 
VosViewer. A search phrase of “life cycle assessment torrefaction”
was  used  limiting  the  search  to  articles  and  review  documents 
yielded 26 scientiﬁc papers. Generated from VosViewer, the bib- 
liometric keyword network consists of 26 scientiﬁc journals. The 
most common keywords of these works as shown in the ﬁgure are 
“life cycle”, “biomass”, “greenhouse gases”, “life cycle assessment”, 
and “torrefaction”. 

Out  of  the  26  scientiﬁc  documents,  3  are  review  documents 
which  are  discussed  as  follows.  A  review  study  was  performed 
and compared the environmental impacts of various thermochemi- 
cal processes, which utilized microalgal and lignocellulosic biomass 
for bioenergy production [311] . The results have shown torrefaction 
to have the least global warming potential (GWP) compared with 
the  other  thermochemical  processes.  This  was  due  to  the  mini- 
mal heat requirement of torrefaction compared with other thermo- 
chemical processes while signiﬁcantly enhancing the caloriﬁc value 
of the biomass. A review focusing on the techno-economic and life- 
cycle analyses was conducted on eight different negative emission 
technologies (NETs) [312] . Torrefaction was used as a pretreatment 
technology for biomass combustion to generate power. Power gen- 
eration through the combustion of torreﬁed biomass has resulted 
in the lowest GWP compared with the other NETs. However, it also

of ∼0.008 kg 
CO2 /MJ energy . When compared with the GWP impact of 
other thermochemical processes, the GWP range and mean values 
of torreﬁed biomass is relatively lower. Despite the positive emis- 
sion impact of torreﬁed biomass, a negative emission impact for 
torreﬁed  biomass  can  be  achieved  through  the  excess  electricity 
generated during the biofuel conversion process, mainly attribut- 
ing to the elevated heating value of the gas produced [316] . More- 
over,  carbon  uptake  of  plants  through  photosynthesis  can  suﬃ- 
ciently compensate for the emission impact during the combustion 
of  torreﬁed  biomass.  Moreover,  the  valuation  of  the  co-products 
of torrefaction through the bioreﬁnery on circular bioeconomy can 
enhance the environmental performance and economic viability of 
the torreﬁed biomass [317] . However, further studies on torrefac- 
tion  speciﬁcally  focusing  on  its  potential  as  a  negative  emission 
technology  (NET)  needs  to  be  further  evaluated  in  future  works 
[318] . 

With the results of the available studies in the literature on the 
LCA of torrefaction, the GHG emission impact of torrefaction is rel- 
atively low when compared with other technologies. However, its 
potential for NET can be enhanced through an LCA study specif- 
ically  accounting  for  the  carbon  uptake  of  plants  in  its  growing 
stage and considering the excess electricity generated from the co- 
product gas. 

6.4. Net energy analysis 

A net energy analysis is an assessment methodology to account 
for the energy expenditures and quantify the energy gains of an 
energy product [319] such as torreﬁed biomass. In most cases, life- 
cycle energy analysis is employed to assess the energy content of 
biofuels [320] . The net energy gain is the surplus energy from a 
conversion process which accounts for the energy expenditure and 
the gross energy wherein a higher value is desired [321] . 

Previous works employed net energy analysis to assess the net 
energy gain of torreﬁed biomass. The non-oxidative torrefaction of 
groundnut shells was performed in an industrial burner and reac- 
tor chamber which resulted in a net energy gain of 17.15 to 22.53 
MJ kg −1 [322] . The pretreated cotton stalk through torrefaction was 
assessed using an energetic performance, and the analysis revealed 
that the torreﬁed cotton stalk had a higher net energy eﬃciency 
by 60% [323] . Torrefaction of corn stover was performed to assess 
the net energy balance of the generated solid carbonaceous prod- 
uct, which yielded 92.2% of the energy input [324] . The net energy 
potential  was  evaluated  to  estimate  the  energy  demand  for  the 
production of refuse-derived fuel torrefaction in a waste-to-carbon 
framework  [325] .  The  life-cycle  net  energy  balance  for  microal- 
gal biomass was quantiﬁed at 6.48 MJ MJ −1 for the gas generated 
from torrefaction [326] . Various types of biomass were evaluated 
to quantify the net energy ratio of the mixture of torreﬁed biomass 
and coal ranging from 0.37 to 0.42 [327] . The energy output of tor- 

reﬁed rice straw and torreﬁed fountain grass were quantiﬁed to 
evaluate the implication of torrefaction as a biomass pretreatment 
process [328] . Life-cycle energy analysis was performed to compare 
various conversion processes, including torrefaction for the produc- 
tion of rice-straw bioenergy where the results yielded an energy 
return on investment ratio of 4.13 to 8.86 and a net energy ratio 
ranging from 3.13 to 7.86 [329] . Using an integrated approach with 
net energy analysis, the tradeoff between environmental and en- 
ergy performance of torreﬁed biomass was evaluated, and it was 
found that torrefaction was a good stand-alone system that could 
generate bioenergy while achieving negative emissions [330] . 

The net energy analysis enabled the quantiﬁcation of the energy 
content of various biomass materials through torrefaction. The re- 
sults revealed that by using torrefaction as a pre-treatment process 
for biomass gasiﬁcation, it maximizes the potential of the biomass 
to produce bioenergy [ 326 , 329 ]. Furthermore, integrating net en- 
ergy analysis with the life-cycle assessment [ 326 , 329 ] and techno- 
economic analysis [330] provides a multi-criteria assessment tool 
for torrefaction of biomass which can outline underlying tradeoffs 
between energy content, environmental impact, and costs. 

7. Challenges and perspectives 

In recent years, torrefaction is a fast-developed technology to 
produce solid biofuel (biochar) or sustainable materials for several 
applications. For the utilization of solid fuels such as coal, biomass, 
and  biochar,  self-heating  is  a  serious  problem  due  to  the  safety 
concern  of  producers  and  users  [ 331 , 332 ].  The  self-heating  phe- 
nomenon in the course of fuel storage occurs when the exothermic 
reactions like oxidation reactions become pronounced. Self-heating 
starts at a low temperature and gradually increases under the heat 
released by the reactions. A signiﬁcantly rising temperature can be 
found when the heat release rate is faster than the heat dissipa- 
tion rate in a torreﬁed biomass stockpile [333] . Self-heating will 
be followed by self-ignition and then combustion which may even 
give rise to a ﬁring. Self-heating of torreﬁed wood is initiated with 
oxidation below 100 °C, and the lower limit of the initiation tem- 
perature is between 85 and 90 °C [334] . Evangelista [333] examined 
self-heating  and  self-ignition  of  torreﬁed  beech  chips  in  contact 
with oxygen and found that oxygen adsorption on the wood sur- 
face was enhanced by torrefaction severity. This implied that the 
increase of self-heating and self-ignition propensity increased with 
increasing torrefaction severity. To reduce the self-heating, ﬁnding 
operating conditions with a feasible cooling process is a crucial is- 
sue for torrefaction industrial plants. Detailed self-heating mecha- 
nism during torreﬁed biomass storage is a potential issue for fur- 
ther research. 

As  mentioned  earlier,  torrefaction  has  been  applied  in  gasiﬁ- 
cation,  small-scale  combustion,  and  co-ﬁring  in  pulverized  coal- 
ﬁred  power  plants,  resulting  from  the  property  upgrade  of  tor- 
reﬁed  biomass  [ 297 , 305 ].  However,  the  persistent  organic  pollu- 

25

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 82 (2021) 100887 

tants  (POPs)  such  as  polychlorinated  dibenzo-p-dioxins  (PCDDs) 
and  dibenzofurans  (PCDFs)  during  torrefaction  at  the  tempera- 
ture  range  of  200-350 °C  may  be  formed  [335] .  It  was  reported 
that POPs formation occurs mainly via heterogeneous reactions in 
two  possible  ways:  a  precursor  pathway  and  de  novo  synthesis 
from  a  carbonaceous  matrix  [ 336 , 337 ].  Gao  [335]  evaluated  the 
formation  of  PCDDs  and  PCDFs  during  torrefaction  from  various 
biomass  materials  such  as  stem  wood,  bark,  wood  from  a  dis- 
carded telephone pole, cassava stems, and particle board. Their ex- 
aminations  suggested  that  PCDDs  formed  partly  originated  from 
new formation and partly physical transformation from volatiliza- 
tion, as well as re-condensation of PCDDs present in the feedstock. 
Meanwhile,  the  net  formation  of  PCDFs  was  lower  than  that  of 
PCDDs, except for the telephone pole sample. The results also in- 
dicated that the highly chlorinated congeners tend to be retained 
in biochar, whereas the less chlorinated ones were predominantly 
volatilized into the gas phase during torrefaction. When biomass 
undergoes torrefaction, the improved physical-chemical properties 
make the produced biochar more appropriate for energy conver- 
sion [338] and as an alternative fuel to coal [101] . On the other 
hand,  the  torrefaction  process  increases  the  ash  content  in  ﬁnal 
products, and this limits the applications of combustion and gasiﬁ- 
cation from torreﬁed biomass [339] . This arises from the fact that 
the ash-related problems such as alkali-induced slagging, silicate 
melt-induced  slagging,  and  corrosion  occurring  in  biomass-ﬁred 
furnaces, will be encountered [340] . 

To overcome the emissions and ash-related issues, washing pre- 
treatment  could  be  a  promising  route  to  reduce  pollutant  emis- 
sions during torrefaction and remove ash in torreﬁed biomass. It 
was reported that the pretreatment by washing could remove the 
problematic chemical species such as K, Na, Ca, Mg, Fe, Cl, S, and 
P  from  biomass  [ 341 , 342 ].  The  hot  water  washing  can  enhance 
the removal eﬃciency of these compounds. The removal of S and 
Cl  decreases  acid  gaseous  products  and  results  in  reducing  cor- 
rosion  in  boilers  and  environmental  impacts  [341] .  Abelha  et  al. 
[342] evaluated combustion improvements of upgraded biomass by 
washing and showed that approximately 90% of Cl and up to 60- 
80% of K could be removed by washing. The experimental combus- 
tion  work  showed  that  NO x  emissions  were  decreased  after  up- 
grading, and high-temperature chlorine corrosion could be effec- 
tively mitigated. The biochar with higher ash content also presents 
the  potential  to  be  used  as  construction  materials,  low-cost  ad- 
sorbents, and agricultural soil ameliorant [ 145 , 340 ]. When biochar 
is  used for  soil  amendment, carbon  sequestration can  be  imple- 
mented,  thereby  achieving  negative  carbon  emissions  [343] .  The 
use of biochar as a soil amendment is commonly proposed to im- 
prove soil water retention, especially in dry climate areas suffer- 
ing from water scarcity [344] . Heikkinen et al. [344] pointed out 
that the biochars obtained from slow pyrolysis and torrefaction in- 
creased the soil volumetric water content at ﬁeld capacity. More- 
over, future work should also consider the environmental impact 
of  torreﬁed  preservative-treated  wood  as  it  contains  heavy  met- 
als that are harmful to human health and the environment [345] . 
However, it was found that torreﬁed biomass and biochar are good 
adsorbent  alternatives  for  the  removal  of  acid  gases  [346]  and 
should be further explored in future studies. 

The  problem  induced  by  tar,  one  of  the  by-products  formed 
from  biomass  torrefaction,  is  also  an  important  challenge  that 
needs to be solved, especially in industrial systems. The main prod- 
uct from biomass torrefaction is biochar, however, tar and liquid 
products account for around 10-40 wt%, depending on feedstocks 
and torrefaction severity [ 138 , 347 ]. This implies, that 2,0 0 0-8,0 0 0 
ton year −1 of tar could be produced for the torrefaction industry 
with a production capacity of 20,0 0 0 ton year −1 . The produced tar 
causes diﬃculty in the pipeline, reactor, and facility management. 

Form this viewpoint, the new process or tar application concepts 
should be developed for the post-treatment of tar. 

Concerning the challenges of commercialization in biomass tor- 
refaction, the major commercial challenges of torrefaction are ﬁ- 
nancing, market maturity, and availability of the products. The eco- 
nomic analysis shows that torreﬁed biomass is not yet competi- 
tive to wood pellets, mainly because of the additional investment 
for the torrefaction reactor. The raw material price is the most in- 
ﬂuencing factor in the overall economics of the torrefaction. Most 
torrefaction developers are small companies with a limited ﬁnan- 
cial base. Convincing investors to ﬁnance the necessary R&D and 
up-scaling effort is a real challenge. One or more torrefaction con- 
cepts will emerge out of a large variety of technologies and initia- 
tives. Therefore, torrefaction suppliers require enough development 
power to optimize and scale-up their torrefaction concepts. Attain- 
ing  product  standardization  is  also  needed  to  make  the  market 
more transparent and reliable. The study of Wilén et al. [348] sug- 
gested that an integrated concept may offer potential beneﬁts to 
meet the required cost level. 

8. Conclusions 

Relevant  fundamentals  of  torrefaction  have  been  elaborated, 
and  the  reaction  phenomena  during  torrefaction  have  been  ex- 
haustively illustrated. The inﬂuences of some important operating 
parameters such as temperature, duration, particle size, carrier gas, 
catalyst, etc., on torrefaction outcome have been described, while 
the torrefaction indexes have also been introduced to characterize 
torrefaction performance. 

Torreﬁed biomass has been applied in co-combustion and co- 
gasiﬁcation for the productions of heat, electricity, and syngas. Re- 
cently, torreﬁed biomass has also been researched for different ap- 
plications such as soil amendment and adsorbents for pollutant re- 
moval to achieve carbon sequestration, and even the development 
of negative CO 
2 emission technologies. In the overview of the tor- 
refaction systems, there is still no optimal pretreatment, reactor, or 
post-treatment. It is quite dependent on the type of feedstock, the 
application of the products, and the consideration of costs. Besides, 
several technologies are required to be promoted to achieve higher 
thermal eﬃciency, higher productivity, homogeneous products, and 
better temperature control. The development of a continuous sys- 
tem is also an important part. Furthermore, economic analysis is 
also necessary to be taken into account to evaluate the integrated 
torrefaction  process  for  commercialization  purposes.  It  has  been 
recognized that non-oxidative torrefaction presents a promising re- 
sult in terms of biochar quality, however, may also present invest- 
ment challenges. Thus, the development of oxidative torrefaction 
may command future research and development work to enable 
the cost-effective production of biochar. 

Torrefaction  provides  an  environmental-friendly  biomass  pre- 
treatment for bioenergy production by improving its heating value 
while  resulting  in  a  relatively  lower  greenhouse  gas  emissions 
compared  with  other  pretreatments  and  thermochemical  pro- 
cesses. It is considered as a negative emission technology by the 
carbon  uptake  of  biomass  considering  the  life-cycle  of  torreﬁed 
biomass. Future studies may focus on the LCA of different microal- 
gae species to produce torreﬁed biomass. Various allocation and 
uncertainty analyses can also be performed in conducting future 
LCA studies on torrefaction. Moreover, impact assessment of heavy 
metal  contaminants  in  the  torrefaction  of  various  biomass  feed- 
stocks must be considered in future works to deeply understand 
the risk involved in human health and the environment. Biochar 
has also been found to be a good alternative adsorbent for the re- 
moval of acid gas which may further be explored in future studies.
