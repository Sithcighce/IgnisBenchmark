Turbulent  premixed  combustion  involves  simultaneous  and  mutually  interacting  ﬂuid,  chemical,  and 
transport phenomena spanning a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Many practical combustion 
devices – such as gas turbine combustors, afterburners, and ramjets – operate with turbulent ﬂows that 
contain length and time scales smaller than those associated with premixed ﬂame propagation. This pa- 
per reviews current knowledge and understanding of premixed ﬂames at such “highly turbulent” con- 
ditions, including the effects of turbulence on the ﬂame and of the ﬂame on turbulence. At these con- 
ditions, turbulent ﬂuid motions can have a leading-order effect on the ﬂame thermochemical structure, 
scalar gradients, and the resultant scalar dynamics. At the same time, the turbulent ﬂow itself is affected 
by heat release from the ﬂame, resulting in differences compared to classical non-reacting turbulence 
and to turbulence in ﬂames at lower intensities. We therefore aim to address the following overarching 
questions: (a) What are highly turbulent premixed ﬂames, how do we characterize them, and what are 
some of their macroscale behaviors? (b) How are the ﬂame thermochemical states, scalar gradients, dif- 
fusion, and other aspects of the ﬂame structure affected by intense turbulence? (c) How are the structure 
and dynamics of the turbulence affected by the presence of the ﬂame in terms of ﬂuxes, spectra, kinetic 
energy, and other relevant quantities? We also provide a summary of critical knowledge gaps and an 
outlook for future research directions.

1. Introduction 

Nearly  all  practical  applications  of  combustion  occur  in  tur- 
bulent ﬂows, generally by design. Turbulent combustion involves 
non-linear  multi-scale  interactions  between  chemistry,  transport, 
and  ﬂuid  motions  that  have  leading  order  effects  on  the  ﬂame 
and ﬂow behavior. For premixed turbulent combustion, turbulent 
ﬂuid motions lead to an increase in the surface area of reactive 
scalars that is associated with an increase in the turbulent burn- 
ing rate. Turbulence also creates large gradients in thermodynamic 
and chemical quantities, resulting in substantially greater thermo- 
chemical  complexity  than  in  laminar  ﬂames  (e.g.,  broader  ther- 
mochemical phase spaces and highly varied thermochemical tra- 
jectories along Lagrangian ﬂuid pathlines). Moreover, the ﬂuid dy- 
namic strain rate and vorticity directly affect the dynamics of re- 
active thermochemical scalar gradients, thus impacting, for exam- 
ple, the local ﬂame orientation, thickness, and iso-surface propa- 
gation speed. Thermochemical gradients generated by combustion 
chemistry also inﬂuence the turbulence, both by altering transport 
properties and through thermal expansion (e.g., ﬂow divergence, 
density gradients, etc.). 

Although  numerous  studies,  including  several  detailed  re- 
views [1–10] , have addressed turbulent premixed combustion oc- 
curring at relatively modest turbulence intensities, comparatively 
little research has addressed fundamental turbulence-ﬂame inter- 
actions at the highly turbulent conditions relevant to many practi- 
cal devices and situations, such as lean premixed gas turbine com- 
bustors, afterburners, ramjets, and other occurrences of fast sub- 
sonic ﬂames [11] . Indeed, a surge of studies on highly turbulent 
premixed ﬂames emerged around 2015. The purpose of this paper 
is to review the current state of knowledge regarding the struc- 
ture  and  dynamics  of  highly-turbulent  premixed  ﬂames,  includ- 

ing both the effects of turbulence on the ﬂame and the ﬂame on 
turbulence. 

The dynamical system describing turbulent combustion is out- 
lined mathematically in Section 2 . For now, it is suﬃcient to note 
that this system is nonlinear due to various physical effects repre- 
sented in the governing equations, including advection, chemical 
sources,  pressure-velocity  coupling,  and  temperature-dependent 
molecular transport processes. Of note is the advective nonlinearity 
in the Navier-Stokes equations describing conservation of momen- 
tum. In turbulent ﬂows, this nonlinearity dominates over the (lin- 
ear) effects of viscous diffusion of momentum. The integral-scale 
Reynolds number, Re (cid:2) , which characterizes the relative magnitudes 
of the advective nonlinearity and viscous diffusion, is thus typically 
very large in turbulent ﬂows. 

As a result of the dominant nonlinearity in high Re (cid:2) turbulent 
ﬂows, large spatial and temporal variations in ﬂow properties are 
created over a wide range of length and time scales. This multi- 
scale spatio-temporal complexity leads to the formation of turbu- 
lent ﬂuctuations at increasingly small scales as Re (cid:2)  increases, re- 
sulting  in  the  creation  of  large  spatial  gradients  in  velocity  and 
other quantities (e.g., temperature and chemical species concentra- 
tions). These large gradients, in turn, lead to rapid molecular trans- 
port  of  thermochemical  scalars  (e.g.,  temperature  and  chemical 
species concentrations), as compared to variations due to chemi- 
cal reactions alone. 

It is this mixing property of turbulence that makes it partic- 
ularly attractive for many combustion systems. For non-premixed 
combustion, turbulence accelerates the rate-limiting process of fuel 
and oxidizer mixing. For premixed combustion—in which reaction 
rates  are  not  limited  by  the  rate  of  fuel  and  oxidizer  mixing—
turbulence  increases  the  rate  at  which  energy  and  species  are 
mixed between the products and reactants, ultimately leading to

an increased reaction rate compared to laminar ﬂames. We note 
that “mixing” in this context refers to combined advective and dif- 
fusive processes; non-linear advective stirring increases the mag- 
nitude and spatial extent of scalar and velocity gradients, which 
then lead to rapid molecular diffusion. Together, the statistical ef- 
fect of advective turbulent stirring and enhanced molecular diffu- 
sion is often referred to as “turbulent diffusion”. 

However, turbulence also complicates the design, analysis, and 
operation of combustion systems. The broad range of length and 
time scales at play in turbulent combustion—from the large inte- 
gral scales to the Kolmogorov and chemical scales—precludes di- 
rect numerical simulations (DNS) of practical devices in engineer- 
ing contexts; models must therefore be employed. For example, in 
the context of large eddy simulations (LES), models are required 
to describe the inﬂuence of unresolved subﬁlter scale (SFS) phe- 
nomena  on  resolved  scale  behaviors.  In  highly  turbulent  ﬂames, 
much of the turbulence-induced thermochemical complexity and 
the ﬂame-induced turbulence dynamics exist in the subﬁlter scales 
and must be modeled. In order to create physics-based models, it 
therefore is critical to understand the various interactions between 
the ﬂame and turbulence that can occur at highly turbulent condi- 
tions. 

In this review, we address the following overarching questions: 

1. What are highly turbulent ﬂames, how are they characterized, 

and what are some of their macro-scale behaviors? 

2. How  are  the  thermochemical  structure  and  dynamics  of  the 

ﬂame modiﬁed by the presence of intense turbulence? 

3. How are turbulence structure and dynamics modiﬁed by pre- 

mixed ﬂames at highly turbulent conditions? 

The ﬁrst items are addressed primarily in Section 2 , while the 
second and third questions are addressed in Sections 3 and 4 , re- 
spectively. An outlook for future research directions is provided in 
Section 5 . 

2. Preliminary comments and global characteristics 

We  will  often  discuss  the  effects  of  turbulence  on  premixed 
ﬂames by differentiating the turbulent ﬂame “structure” and “dy- 
namics” from that which would occur under laminar ﬂow condi- 
tions. The expected impact of turbulence on the ﬂame is typically 
described  through  various  dimensionless  parameters  constructed 
using characteristic length, time, and/or velocity-scales, which may 
be  visualized  through  regime  diagrams.  We  therefore  begin  this

review with a brief discussion of laminar ﬂame structure, dimen- 
sionless parameters, regime diagrams, and the locations of some 
engineering-relevant devices in the regime diagrams. We also in- 
clude  a  brief  discussion  of  experimental  and  DNS  conﬁgurations 
commonly used to study highly turbulent combustion, as well as 
the turbulent ﬂame speeds observed in these conﬁgurations. Sev- 
eral practical and theoretical challenges are highlighted, and some 
best practices are recommended. 

2.1. Governing equations 

In  general  terms,  turbulent  combustion  is  characterized  by 
highly irregular ﬂuid motions that are coupled with reactive scalar 
dynamics, both of which vary in space and time in a complicated 
manner. The ﬂuid density ( ρ), velocity vector ( u

is the rate-of-strain tensor. Sources of Y β (i.e., due to chemical re- 
actions) are represented by  ˙ ω β and may take on positive or nega- 
tive values. All of the transport coeﬃcients (i.e., κ, D β , μ, and μB ) 
appearing in the above equations depend on the local temperature 
and ﬂuid composition, and are not constant in reacting ﬂows. A full 
description of the system dynamics therefore requires auxiliary re- 
lations to represent the chemical reactions, transport coeﬃcients, 
and the thermodynamic equation of state. From a Lagrangian point 
of view, Eqs. (1) –(4) state that the change in thermodynamic, ﬂow, 
and  chemical  properties  following  a  ﬂuid  element  at  location  x 
at time t is a result of the balance between diffusive (molecular 
transport) effects and various source terms. 

1 

Eq. (4) can also be written in terms of species mole fractions. Indeed, it can be 
viewed as a general equation for any reactive scalar with gradient diffusion, given 
an appropriate diffusion coeﬃcient. For clarity, we will largely treat chemical scalars 
in terms of mass fractions in this paper. 

j ≡ ∂ Y/∂ x 

For  chemical  species,  the  source  term  is  generally  local,  de- 
pending only on the local composition and temperature-dependent 
reaction rate coeﬃcient. By contrast, diffusion processes are non- 
local, being driven by gradients (e.g., χ
j ) that couple ad- 
jacent  dissimilar  ﬂuid  states.  In  laminar  ﬂames,  the  competition 
between  advection,  reaction,  and  molecular  diffusion  ultimately 
determines the structure and evolution of the scalar ﬁeld. This also 
holds true in turbulent ﬂames, but with turbulent advection lead- 
ing to a broader range of scalar gradients than are found in laminar 
ﬂames (thereby affecting the diffusion process) and, consequently, 
a wider range of thermochemical states (affecting the reaction pro- 
cess). 

2.2. Laminar premixed ﬂames 

2.2.1. Deﬂagrations and auto-ignition 

Turbulent ﬂames may exhibit local behaviors ranging from be- 
ing  similar  to  laminar  premixed  deﬂagrations—in  which  energy 
and species diffusion are necessary to sustain the reactions—to be- 
ing similar to autoignition 2 . While laminar deﬂagrations are most 
common, as will be discussed in Section 3 , turbulence may cre- 
ate  local  gas  mixtures  that  should  be  viewed  as  auto-igniting 
fronts [13–16] . Hence, this distinction will become important for 
discussions  in  Section  3 ,  although  devices  that  rely  on  auto- 
ignition as the major combustion mode (e.g. some sequential gas 
turbine combustors [17] ) are not the main focus of this review. 

To  illustrate  these  combustion  modes,  consider  a  one- 
dimensional (1D) linear domain with a steady laminar ﬂame in the 
observer reference frame. Hence, the speed of the gas upstream of 
the ﬂame is the “laminar ﬂame speed”, denoted s 0 
L (the superscript 
‘0’ indicates that the ﬂame is ‘unstretched’). In cases where the ig- 
nition delay time (or induction time, τ
i ) of the reactant mixture is 
long compared to the residence time of the unburnt mixture in the 
system (i.e., L/s 0 
L , where L is the characteristic induction length), 
reactions are sustained by diffusion of energy and species from the 
products to the reactants (a deﬂagration). The laminar ﬂame speed 
is then an intrinsic property of the reactant mixture that can be 
solved through an eigenvalue problem [18] and is independent of 
the ignition delay time. 

For reactant mixtures in which the ignition delay is short com- 
pared to the residence time of the gas in the domain, the reactants 
will auto-ignite in the absence of any external source and without 
the need for diffusion from the products. The ﬂame then stabilizes 
L τ
after an induction length L = s 0 
i is a unique function 
of the reactant state, in this context, the “laminar ﬂame speed” de- 
pends both on the reactants and the “desired” induction length; it 
is not a unique function of the mixture. These two limiting cases 
are demonstrated in Fig. 1 , which shows the laminar ﬂame speed 
(i.e., the reactant gas speed for a stationary ﬂame) as a function of 
induction length for various atmospheric pressure H 2 /air ﬂames at 
different reactant temperatures.

2.2.2. Laminar premixed deﬂagrations 

We now turn brieﬂy to laminar premixed deﬂagrations in or- 
der to deﬁne some quantities and concepts needed for the subse- 
quent discussion. Fig. 2 shows computed proﬁles of various quanti- 
ties through laminar unstretched deﬂagrations with different fuels 
at  a  constant  pressure  of  p = 1  atm  and  a  reactant  temperature 
of T r = 500 K 3 . The fuel consumption and heat release rates are

Detonation waves occur when the combustion wave travels at a supersonic 
speed. Although this mode of combustion can occur in many engineering and nat- 
ural contexts, the focus of the present review is on subsonic, non-detonative, com- 
bustion. 

All laminar ﬂame calculations in this work are done in PREMIX [19] using the 

HyChem approach [20–22] with multi-component and Soret diffusion.

shown, along with mass fractions of a few key species. Tempera- 
ture is used to demarcate different regions of the laminar ﬂame, 
and also to serve as a reasonable measure of the progress variable 
c (see Refs. [23,24] for other methods of deﬁning c). The origin of 
the physical space coordinates is at the peak heat release rate for 
each ﬂame. 

For the methane/air ﬂame shown in Fig. 2 (a), the exothermic 
reactions are conﬁned to a relatively compact region at high tem- 
perature ( T (cid:2) 1200 K) termed the “reaction zone”. Upstream of this 
is  a  similarly  compact  region  over  which  the  reactants  begin  to 
breakdown, forming CH 2 O , H 2 , and other species. Species and en- 
ergy diffuse further upstream in a relatively inert “preheat zone”
that  is  dominated  by  molecular  transport  processes.  Ultimately, 
however, the species proﬁles at all locations reﬂect the simultane- 
ous effects of reaction, diffusion, and laminar convection, even as 
the relative balance of these effects varies throughout the ﬂame. 

The fuel consumption and heat release rates are co-located for 
the  lean  methane/air  ﬂame  due  to  the  relatively  high  tempera- 
tures required for methane-to-methyl initiation reactions. However, 
this relationship is compromised for the n-dodecane/air and hy- 
drogen/air ﬂames shown in Figs. 2 (b)-(c). For the n-dodecane/air 
ﬂame,  fuel  consumption  precedes  the  heat  release  zone  due  to 
endothermic fuel pyrolysis. Such fuel cracking is expected for all 
heavy  hydrocarbons  [20,21,25] .  For  the  hydrogen/air  ﬂame,  the 
heat release zone overlaps with the fuel consumption region, al- 
though  the  peak  of  heat  release  precedes  that  of  the  fuel  con- 
sumption. Heat release and fuel consumption both occur near the 
leading edge of the ﬂame. Hence, a largely inert preheat zone and 
thin chemically-active reaction zone do not occur for these lami- 
nar ﬂames (though the exothermic reactions are conﬁned to a rel- 
atively thin region in the n-dodecane ﬂame).

ployed to deﬁne normalization chemical time scales for turbulent 
ﬂames, both locally and globally. As previously mentioned, the un- 
stretched laminar ﬂame speed of a deﬂagration is a unique func- 
tion of the reactant state, including composition, temperature, and 
pressure. The laminar ﬂame speed is conventionally derived from 
1D unstretched laminar ﬂames where the least ambiguity is intro- 
duced in its deﬁnition/computation [26] . 

Fig. 3 shows the laminar ﬂame speed of n-dodecane as a func- 
tion of temperature (from T = 500 K to 1100 K in 100 K intervals), 
equivalence ratios (from φ = 0 . 6 to 1 in 0.05 intervals), and pres- 
sures (from p = 28 bar to 32 bar in 0.5 bar intervals). As predicted 
by combustion theory [27] , the laminar ﬂame speed has a weak 
negative correlation with pressure, as well as a weak dependence 
on equivalence ratio in the fuel-lean (i.e., φ < 1 ) region. Tempera- 
ture has a leading-order effect on the laminar ﬂame speed; s 0 
L  in- 
creases by approximately seven-fold as the reactant temperature 
is raised from 500 K to 1100 K. It is important to recognize this

posits that, in cases where ﬂame structures are thinner than the 
turbulence scales distorting the ﬂame (or, equivalently, the ﬂame 
time  scales  are  shorter  than  turbulence  time  scales),  the  inter- 
nal ﬂame structure remains nearly constant while it moves in the 
ﬂow [2,28] . Hence, in such situations, the thermochemical struc- 
ture and dynamics of a 3D turbulent ﬂame can be mapped onto 
the structure of an ensemble of 1D laminar ﬂame solutions based 
on a small number of parameters. This idea underlies a large num- 
ber of reaction rate modeling strategies, such as ﬂamelet prolon- 
gation of intrinsic low dimensional manifolds [29] , ﬂamelet gener- 
ated manifolds [30] , ﬂame surface density methods [31] , and level 
set (e.g., G-equation) methods [32] . 

Our focus here is on the structure and dynamics of turbulent 
premixed  combustion  at  conditions  where  ﬂame  structures  are 
thicker,  potentially  by  a  considerable  amount,  than  some  of  the 
turbulent scales of motion. This includes both the local thermo- 
chemical structure of the scalar ﬁelds and their gradients, along 
with the structure and dynamics of the underlying turbulence that 
interacts with the thermochemical scalars. We note that the aim is 
not to evaluate the validity of different modelling paradigms that 
may be applied to turbulent ﬂames, but rather to review current 
understanding of the physics and chemistry in these systems. 

2.3. Conﬁgurations and other practical considerations 

Before discussing the parameters and characteristics of highly- 
turbulent  ﬂames,  it  is  helpful  to  brieﬂy  review  some  of  the  at- 
tributes of conﬁgurations—both experimental and computational—
that are used to study them. As the focus of this paper is on the 
underlying structure and dynamics of ﬂames and turbulence, we 
exclude from consideration conﬁgurations that contain highly tur- 
bulent ﬂames but have been used to study other aspects of com- 
bustion. For example, we do not consider studies or conﬁgurations 
focused  on  thermoacoustic  instabilities  or  blow-out.  Detailed  re- 
views of these topics are provided elsewhere [33–35] . 

Experimental  conﬁgurations  that  have  been  used  to  investi- 
gate turbulent ﬂame structure and dynamics include rod-stabilized 
bluff-body ﬂames [36–39] , swirl ﬂames (both low-swirl and high- 
swirl) [40–43] , jet ﬂames [44–50] , Bunsen ﬂames [51–59] , expand- 
ing ﬂame kernels [60–63] , and propagating ﬂames in tubes [64] . 
With few exceptions [64] , these ﬂames have been either uncon- 
ﬁned by mechanical boundaries (i.e., combustion chambers), or the 
experiments ended before the ﬂame interacted with the walls. This 
lack  of  conﬁnement  provides  optical  access  for  laser  diagnostics 
without  the  complication  of  windows,  but  adds  other  complica- 
tions that will be discussed below. 

A  common  feature  of  jet  and  Bunsen  ﬂames 4  is  that,  in  the 
absence of an open ﬂame tip, the ﬂame envelopes the reactants. 
Hence,  the  mass  ﬂow  rate  of  reactants  burnt  by  the  ﬂame  is 
known, which allows calculation of the global consumption speed 
of the turbulent ﬂame. In contrast, reactants may bypass the ﬂame 
in bluff-body and swirl-ﬂame conﬁgurations. A potential advantage 
of the latter ﬂames is that they all involve a recirculation zone that 
helps anchor the ﬂames, whereas jet and Bunsen ﬂames require 
pilots in order to stabilize the ﬂame base at highly turbulent con- 
ditions. 

However, unconﬁned ﬂames, whether piloted or not, add com- 
plications under highly turbulent conditions. To illustrate this, we 
consider the Lund University piloted jet (LUPJ) burner [47–50] and 
the Michigan Hi-Pilot Bunsen burner [56–58] . Schematics of these 

4 

Both jet and Bunsen ﬂames involve a jet of reactants issuing from a nozzle. The 
difference between the two is that the turbulence that interacts with the ﬂame in 
the jet conﬁguration arises due to shear between the jet ﬂuid and surroundings, 
whereas the turbulence that is meant to interact with a Bunsen ﬂame is generated 
upstream of the reactants exiting the nozzle.

dependence, because local variations of the equivalence ratio and 
temperature are expected in highly turbulent ﬂames, as discussed 
in Sec. 3.2.1 . The temperature range in Fig. 3 is chosen to demon- 
strate the strong temperature dependence of laminar ﬂame speed. 
However,  it  should  be  recognized  that  it  is  challenging  to  mea- 
sure laminar ﬂame speeds with preheat temperatures above 700 K, 
especially for heavy hydrocarbon fuels, due to fuel decomposition 
during the fuel heating and delivery process. 

It is worth brieﬂy mentioning that this discussion of laminar 
ﬂame speed treats the deﬂagration as a coherent wave moving at 
speed  s 0 
L .  However,  due  to  gas  acceleration  normal  to  the  ﬂame 
and the corresponding decrease in density, different locations in 
the ﬂame must move at different speeds in order to maintain a 
stationary ﬂame. This leads to the deﬁnition of the displacement 
speed  of  a  scalar  isosurface  (i.e.,  the  surface  of  constant  scalar 
value Y ∗

where D Y β / D t is given by Eq. (4) . Hence, the displacement speed 
can be viewed as a ﬁeld quantity that obeys a transport equation 
and obtains different values throughout both laminar and turbu- 
lent  ﬂames.  This  also  highlights  that,  unlike  the  “laminar  ﬂame 
speed”, the displacement speed is not a single value for a given 
reactant mixture. Indeed, for a steady laminar ﬂame, the displace- 
ment speed varies between the gas speeds in the  reactants and 
products in order to maintain a steady ﬂame structure; care must 
be taken when evaluating the displacement speed to ensure that 
precise scalar isovalues are tracked. 

The  instantaneous  and  local  thermochemical  state  of  the 
reacting  system  can  be  expressed  as  the  vector  quantity 
[ T ( x , t) , ρ( x , t) , Y ( x , t)] (cid:2) ∈ R n s +2 ,  where  n s  is  the  number  of 
species. In a steady, unstretched laminar ﬂame with a known reac- 
tant thermochemical state the thermochemical state at any point 
can  be  uniquely  indexed  to  the  progress  variable;  the  thermo- 
chemical state is a surjective function with c that is an (n s + 2) - 
dimensional curve in state space. Of course, Eqs. (4) and (7) show 
that the scalar ﬁeld dynamics are controlled not only by the reac- 
tion rate, which depends on the local thermochemical state, but 
also  by  diffusive  processes  that  depend  on  scalar  gradients  that 
couple dissimilar ﬂuid states. However, in a laminar premixed de- 
ﬂagration,  the  scalar  gradients  are  also  uniquely  mapped  by  c. 
Hence, the dynamics of the scalar ﬁelds depend only on c. 

The idea that the thermochemical and spatial structure of a 1D 
laminar premixed ﬂame can be uniquely mapped to the progress 
variable has been very inﬂuential in the theory and modeling of 
turbulent premixed ﬂames. In particular, laminar ﬂamelet theory

burners are shown in Fig. 4 . Both burners involve central jets issu- 
ing into large co-ﬂows containing the products of the pilot ﬂames. 
The pilots are meant to both stabilize the ﬂame and isolate the 
reactants  from  the  surrounding  ambient  air.  In  order  to  achieve 
high  Karlovitz  numbers,  the  jets  are  often  operated  fuel  lean, 
whereas  the  pilots  are  operated  at  richer  conditions  to  enhance 
stability. 

Recently,  the  thermochemical  structures  of  the  LUPJ  and  Hi- 
Pilot  burners  have  been  assessed through  DNS  and  Raman  scat- 
tering  measurements,  respectively  [59,65] .  At  conditions  where 
the  the  jet  and  pilot  were  at  different  equivalence  ratios,  rapid 
turbulence-induced  mixing  of  the  pilot  and  jet  ﬂuids  drastically 
altered the composition of the reaction zones compared to what 
would occur purely from combustion of the reactants. For example, 
Fig. 5 shows the probability density function (PDF) of the measured 
atom-based equivalence ratio conditioned on ﬂuid being in the pri- 
mary reaction zone of the ﬂame (taken to be 0 . 7 ≤ c ≤ 0 . 8 ) [59] . 
The jet ﬂuid was at φ = 0 . 65 and the pilot was at φ = 0 . 90 . Fig. 6 
shows similar PDFs of the local equivalence ratio and conditionally- 
averaged  heat  release  rates  at  different  heights  above  the  LUPJ 
burner from the DNS [65] . These ﬁgures clearly demonstrate that 
the reaction zone composition was not that of the jet, but a mix- 
ture  of  jet  and  pilot  ﬂuid.  No  evidence  of  local  extinction  was 
found in either the DNS or experiments, demonstrating that these 
ﬂames are simultaneously mixing in surrounding ﬂuid while burn- 
ing; such ﬂames are better classiﬁed as “stratiﬁed” than premixed.

It is therefore apparent that conﬁgurations that do not isolate 
the ﬂame of interest from the ambient environment, or that isolate 
it using a thermochemically mismatched pilot, present challenges 
for analysis. That is, the effective composition that is burning in 
these ﬂames is not entirely determined by the intended reactant 
ﬂow. Instead, these ﬂames are stratiﬁed by mixing of the surround- 
ing ﬂuid into the ﬂame structure. 

A  major  implication  of  this  observation  is  that  the  chemi- 
cal scales used to characterize the ﬂames, place them on regime 
diagrams,  normalize  the  turbulent  burning  velocity,  etc.  (see 
Sections  2.4  and  2.5 ),  may  not  actually  be  characteristic  of  the 
chemistry occurring in the ﬂame. Caution therefore must be ap- 
plied when interpreting such results and comparing results across 
conﬁgurations. It is recommended that future conﬁgurations used 
to study highly turbulent ﬂames be either isolated from the ambi-

ent environment or have large co-ﬂow pilots that are thermochem- 
ically matched to the reactants. 

Contrary  to  the  experimental  conﬁgurations,  the  most  popu- 
lar computational conﬁgurations for DNS include the freely prop- 
agating planar ﬂame (e.g., [66–71] ) and expanding ﬂame kernels 
(e.g., [72–76] ), with the rare exception of piloted jet ﬂames [77–
79] and Bunsen ﬂames [80] . The choice of conﬁguration is mostly 
limited by the target range of dynamic scales (i.e., Re (cid:2) ), computa- 
tional cost, complexities of boundary conditions, and robustness in 
numerical implementations. Direct comparisons with experiments 
have begun to emerge in recent years [81] . However, most DNS re- 
main as theoretical tools to study the underlying governing physics 
or to extract a priori information for SFS modeling in LES or closure 
models for Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) simulations. 

With an estimated integral length-scale of approximately one- 
eighth  the  constraining  dimension  of  the  computational  do- 
main  [82] ,  the  attainable  integral  length-scales  of  current  DNS 
studies are still quite limited compared to laboratory-scale exper- 
iments; most DNS studies of highly turbulent ﬂames have a com- 
putational domain of O(1 − 10 mm ) . This also implies that the im- 
pact of large-scale motion, such as that seen in experimental in- 
vestigations [56] , is challenging to capture using DNS. 

The most common remedy to create the desirable turbulence 
statistics in DNS include various schemes of numerical forcing or 
spectral nudging [66,67,83] , which introduces modeling elements 
into DNS. Numerical forcing has also been employed to maintain 
statistically steady-state turbulence (i.e., to compensate the decay 
of turbulence due to dissipation), although subtleties require ex- 
tra caution whenever ﬂames exist [84] . In addition to forcing, an- 
other category of treatment feeds the inlet of the computational 
domain with auxiliary homogeneous isotropic turbulence superim- 
posed on a mean velocity ﬁeld, leveraging Taylor’s hypothesis [85] . 
The mean velocity ﬁeld is often adjusted, based on the turbulent 
burning rate, to maintain a statistically stationary ﬂame in space. 

Recently, DNS has progressed beyond single-step global chem- 
ical  models,  with  more  studies  employing  reduced  or  skeletal 
chemical kinetic models, leveraging recent developments in com- 
pact kinetic models [20–22] . Carefully calibrated chemical kinetic 
models  can  account  for  the  response  to  strain  and  curvature, 
as  well  as  differential  diffusion,  more  realistically.  Consequently, 
fuel-speciﬁc differential diffusion or pyrolysis effects can be stud- 
ied  [66,69,86] .  Moreover,  in  the  regime  of  highly  turbulent  pre- 
mixed ﬂames, the competition between elementary reactions be- 
comes more prominent [87] , which can lead to local or global limit 
conditions  such  as  extinction  [76] .  It  should  be  noted  that  DNS 
with global chemical kinetic models has the distinct advantage of 
readily enabling parametric studies, which can be particularly suit- 
able to investigate problems involving scaling [71] . However, this 
review focuses mostly on studies with more detailed descriptions 
of chemistry, since the impact of turbulence on chemistry is of par- 
ticular interest here. 

2.4. Turbulent ﬂame characterization 

One  goal  of  understanding  the  physics  and  chemistry  of  tur- 
bulent ﬂames is the ability to predict a priori what ﬂame struc- 
tures will occur based on a few characteristic parameters, as this 
can inform proper model selection. Indeed, considerable research 
effort  has  been  devoted  to  correlating  characteristic  dimension-

ally, the focus has been on whether certain scalar ﬁelds are ob- 
served  to  be  “broadened” relative  to  a  laminar  counterpart,  the 
correlation  of  different  scalars  relative  to  laminar  ﬂames,  or  the 
correlation of scalars and scalar gradients (see Section 3 for a de- 
tailed discussion). This section reviews some of the basic principles 
used to characterize turbulent ﬂames, highlights challenges with

this characterization, discusses recent attempts to classify turbu- 
lent  ﬂames  into  regimes,  and  presents  some  suggestions  for  fu- 
ture regime classiﬁcations. Open questions from this Section (and 
Section 2.5 ) motivate the discussion of ﬂame thermochemistry and 
turbulence dynamics in Sections 3 and 4 . 

2.4.1. Characteristic scales and dimensionless parameters 

Turbulent ﬂuid motions are characterized by a wide range of 
scales,  from  the  larger  integral  scales  (i.e.,  length-scale  (cid:2),  time- 
scale T , and velocity-scale u (cid:2) ) where kinetic energy input occurs, 
to the Kolmogorov microscales (i.e., length-, time-, and velocity- 
scales λK , τK ,  and  u K ,  respectively)  where  kinetic  energy  is  dis- 
sipated  into  heat  by  viscous  processes.  The  integral  length-  and 
time-scales for a particular quantity are deﬁned based on the inte- 
gral under the autocorrelation function for that quantity in either 
space or time, with u (cid:2) ≡ (cid:2) T −1 . Physically, these scales indicate the 
spatial and temporal extents required for turbulent ﬂuctuations to 
become de-correlated, or de-coherent. There are different integral 
scales for different ﬂow properties and spatial autocorrelation di- 
rections, as well as for different locations in the ﬂow. However, for 
the  purposes  of  characterizing  turbulence/ﬂame  interactions,  the 
integral length-scale is often represented by some large-scale ge- 
ometric  feature  of  the  system,  such  as  a  nozzle  diameter,  shear 
layer width, or DNS domain size. The integral velocity-scale is of-

where  ν and  ε are  the  local  values  of  the  kinematic  viscosity 
and  mean  kinetic  energy  dissipation  rate,  respectively.  It  should 
be noted that the Kolmogorov scales are deﬁned statistically. This 
presents challenges in turbulent ﬂames, wherein the local temper- 
ature at a point (and hence viscosity) can ﬂuctuate widely as the 
ﬂame structure moves across the point. As such, the Kolmogorov 
scales computed from mean properties at a point may not be rep- 
resentative of the turbulence with which the ﬂame interacts at any 
instant  in  time  (see,  e.g.,  [67,84,88] ).  Physically,  the  Kolmogorov 
length-scale is proportional to the scale at which the effects of vis- 
cous diffusion and turbulent straining on the evolution of the ve- 
locity ﬁeld balance. When characterizing a particular experiment 
or simulation, turbulence is often described at a user-selected lo- 
cation in the reactants where ν = νr is a constant. 

3 / 4 

The  integral  and  Kolmogorov  length-scales  are  related  by 
(cid:2)/λK = c K Re (cid:2) 
where  Re (cid:2) = u (cid:2) (cid:2)/ν is  the  integral-scale  Reynolds 
number  and  c K ,  is  an  O(1)  constant.  Hence,  for  high  Reynolds 
number turbulence (i.e., Re (cid:2) ≫ 1 ), there is a large range of scales 
in the ﬂow. In contrast, a laminar ﬂame involves steep gradients 
over  a  relatively  small  range of  scales,  corresponding  to  one  or- 
der of magnitude between the characteristic length-scale of rapid 
exothermic reactions ( δ0 
r ) and the overall thermal structure of the 
L = O(10 δ0 
ﬂame (i.e., δ0 
r ) ) in hydrocarbon/air ﬂames. 

Common practice is to construct dimensionless groups charac- 
terizing turbulence/ﬂame interactions based on (a) the ratio of the 
integral velocity-scale to laminar ﬂame speed u (cid:2) /s 0 
L ; (b) the ratio 
of the integral length-scale to ﬂame thermal thickness (cid:2)/δ0 
L ; (c) the 
ratio of ﬂame time-scale to Kolmogorov time-scale, 6 which deﬁnes

We will interpret the mean as an ensemble mean taken over a large number of 
realizations of nominally identical simulations/experiments, even if spatial or tem- 
poral means are employed in practice. 

The deﬁnition of Karlovitz number based on τK and Damköhler number based 

on T  is historical. One could equally deﬁne Da

We note that  ¯α can be manually selected for a given ﬂame such 
that  c s = 1  [58,89] .  Peters  [89]  recommends  that  it  should  cor- 
respond  to  the  diffusivity  in  the  “inner  reaction  layer” for  at- 
mospheric  methane/air  ﬂames,  at  a  temperature  between  1600- 
20 0 0 K. Alternatively, one may deﬁne  ¯α at the mean temperature 
between the reactants and products, at the peak of the heat release 
rate, or at some other point. We therefore choose to explicitly leave 
c s as a variable in these equations. 

is between 0.1 and 0.2 for hydrocarbon/air ﬂames. 

As is common practice, we have chosen to characterize the tur- 
bulence  in  the  reactants.  Hence,  Re (cid:2)  is  measured based  on u (cid:2) , 
−1 = 
(cid:2),  and  ν = νr  in  the  unburnt  reactants.  The  group  νr ( ¯αc s )

heat release rate. However, laminar ﬂame calculations indicate that

Furthermore, c K is often taken to be unity, whereas many mea- 
surements show that c K ≈ 0 . 5 and, hence, c −4 
K  ≈ 16 [90–93] . Nev- 
ertheless, Karlovitz and Damköhler numbers based on Eqs. (9) and 
(10) are often reported with unity factors.  Moreover, due to the 
diﬃculty in measuring λK , experiments may use Eq. (11) to esti- 
mate the Karlovitz number, again with a unity factor. While we do 
not advocate that c K ≈ 0 . 5 is a fundamental result that should be 
used universally moving forward, the resultant order-of-magnitude 
ambiguity mandates that caution be taken where comparing tur- 
bulence conditions across different studies and that the method of 
computing Ka δ, K be clearly reported. Recommendations on the lat- 
ter are provided below. 

It is useful to describe how the Karlovitz and Damköhler num- 
bers vary with the physical operating parameters of a combustor. 
To this end, these dimensionless groups can be re-written as

The I-quantities represent terms that depend on the ﬂow condi- 
tions and geometry (e.g., the bulk velocity, turbulence generation, 
and scale) of the system. These terms can be varied independently 
of the I I -quantities, which depend on the thermodynamic state and 
chemical composition (e.g., the reactant pressure, temperature, and 
composition) in a complex manner. 

Fig. 7 shows how II Ka and II Da vary with pressure, reactant tem- 
perature,  and  equivalence  ratio  for  n-dodecane/air  ﬂames.  High 
Karlovitz  numbers  are  associated  with  lower  reactant  tempera- 
tures,  lower  equivalence  ratios,  and  higher  pressure,  with  the 
largest sensitivity to preheat temperature. Unsurprisingly given the 

Fig. 7.  Variation of II Ka and II Da from Eqs. (12) and (13) , respectively, with pressure, 
equivalence ratio, and preheat temperature (indicated by different colors, with the 
colorbar in (a) giving T in units of K) in unstretched laminar n-dodecane/air ﬂames. 

deﬁnitions of II Ka and II Da , high Damköhler numbers follow a gen- 
erally opposite trend, being associated with higher temperatures 
and  higher  equivalence  ratios.  However,  II Da  also  increases  with 
pressure due to the lack of dependence on kinematic viscosity, as 
compared to II Ka . 

This  analysis  demonstrates  a  natural  mitigation  of  extremely 
high Karlovitz numbers and low Damköhler numbers in terrestrial 
systems of engineering relevance. That is, adiabatic compression is 
associated with simultaneous increases in both pressure and tem- 
perature. Fig. 8 shows how II Ka and II Da vary with isentropic com- 
pression up to 25 atm for a ﬁxed equivalence ratio n-dodecane/air 
ﬂame. The Karlovitz and Damköhler number responses are domi- 
nated by the temperature dependence, decreasing and increasing, 
respectively, as the temperature and pressure increase. 

It should be noted that, under the assumption that νr ≈ s 0

rameters  (i.e.,  u (cid:2) /s 0

all other parameters. Furthermore, under this condition and with

It is interesting to note that Eqs. (12) and (14) differ by a factor of

two equations will be approximately equal. However, this may dif- 
fer by a factor of O(10) compared to calculations based on Eq. (9) , 
depending on how λK is calculated and whether νr / ( ¯αc s ) is taken

to be unity. For consistency, it is thus recommended that Eq. ( 14 ) be 
used when reporting Karlovitz numbers. 

Finally, we note that turbulent ﬂames are generally character- 
ized at a single point, often in the unburnt reactants at the exit of 
a nozzle or inlet of a DNS domain. However, practical ﬂames ex- 
hibit widely varying turbulence properties with position. Further- 
more, local ﬂame structures may not correlate directly with local 
turbulence due to the ﬁnite interaction time and advection parallel 
to the ﬂame surface [78,79,94] . These issues are discussed more in 
Section 2.4.2 . 

2.4.2. Expected parameters for highly turbulent ﬂames 

Theoretical  expectations  regarding  the  parameter  space  at 
which  different  ﬂame  structures  occur  are  graphically  expressed 
using  regime  diagrams.  The  two  most  popular  regime  diagrams 
are  those  proposed  by  Williams  [95]  and  by  Borghi  [96] ,  which 
was later modiﬁed by Peters [2] ; for compactness, we will refer 
to  the  former  as  the  “Williams” diagram  and  the  latter  as  the 
“Borghi/Peters” diagram. The former uses Re (cid:2) and Da (cid:2),δ as abscissa 
and ordinate measures, respectively. The latter uses (cid:2)/δ0 
L and u (cid:2) /s 0 
L . 
As mentioned above, in the case of premixed combustion and as- 
−1 = 1 , any two dimensionless groups estab- 
suming c K = νr ( αc s ) 
lish the other groups; the two diagrams are conceptually equiva- 
lent in this case, though different regime labels are traditionally 
used 7 . 

The regime diagrams are shown in Fig. 9 , with some signiﬁcant 
lines and regime labels indicated. The points shown in Fig. 9 cor- 
respond to typical operating conditions of gas turbine main com- 
bustors,  gas  turbine  afterburners,  and  ramjet  engines,  which  are 
summarized in Table 1 and described in more detail below. Note 
that the Borghi/Peters diagram typically includes lines at constant 
values  of  Ka δ,K ,  whereas  the  Williams  diagram  shows  lines  at

The Williams diagram also describes non-premixed combustion.

L .  However,  under  the  assumptions  above,  Ka δ, K = 
(see Eq. (9) ) and lines are labeled as constant Ka δ,K  on 

The line Ka δ, K = 1 is known as the Klimov-Williams (K-W) con- 
dition [95,97,98] , which represents λK = δ0 
L . Hence, at 
lower Karlovitz numbers, the Kolmogorov scale in the reactants is 
larger than the thermal thickness of the ﬂame and the magnitude 
of the associated velocity ﬂuctuations is smaller than the laminar 
ﬂame  speed.  The  ﬂame  is  expected  to  retain  the  internal  struc- 
ture of a laminar ﬂame, corresponding to thin “reaction sheets” or 
“ﬂamelets”, which is supported by numerous studies [8] . 

L  and u K = s 0 

The main focus of this review is on turbulence intensities well 
above the K-W criterion, i.e. Ka δ,K (cid:9) 1 , where the internal ﬂame 
structure  and  turbulence  mutually  interact  in  complicated  ways. 
Indeed, the parameter space beyond the K-W criterion is described

L ; in methane/air ﬂames this gives λK ≈ δ0 

differently in the different regime diagrams. In the Borghi/Peters 
diagram, an additional line is drawn at Ka δ, K = 100 , correspond- 
ing to λK = 0 . 1 δ0 
r . That 
is, the Kolmogorov length-scale (in the reactants) is smaller than 
1/10th  the  laminar  ﬂame  thermal  thickness,  which  is  the  ap- 
proximate  thickness  of  the  exothermic  reaction  layer  in  laminar 
methane/air  ﬂames.  Correspondingly,  the  Kolmogorov  time-scale 
(in the reactants) becomes shorter than the characteristic reaction 
time-scale.  This  boundary  has  been  proposed  as  the  lower  limit 
at which turbulence would modify the “reaction zone” structure 
of a methane/air ﬂame. The region 1 (cid:4) Ka δ, K (cid:4) 100 is proposed to 
have ﬂames exhibiting broadening of the “preheat zone”, but not 
the “reaction zone”. Note that this boundary does not account for 
any affect of the ﬂame on the turbulence ( Section 4 ) 

Williams [28] does not specify a label for the parameter space 
immediately  beyond  Ka δ,K > 1 ,  but  does  propose  a  regime  of 
“distributed  reactions” or  “stirred  reactors” at  (cid:2)/δ0 
L < 1 ,  corre- 
sponding to Damköhler’s second hypothesis regarding small-scale 
turbulence  [99] .  We  note  that  the  intervening  parameter  space 
is  sometimes  labelled  “ﬂamelets  in  eddies”,  following  a  modi- 
ﬁcation  to  the  Williams  diagram  by  Turns  [100] .  Furthermore, 
Williams [101] adds additional lines and labels corresponding to 
the  “thin  reaction  zone” and  “broken  ﬂamelet” regimes  in  the 
Borghi/Peters diagram. 

Section  2.4.3  discusses  limitations  of—and  recent  proposed 
modiﬁcations to—regime diagrams and regime boundaries. Never- 
theless, regardless of these limitations, it is instructive to demon- 
strate where some typical combustion systems—in which “highly 
turbulent” ﬂames may be expected—operate in terms of the regime 
diagram. Hence, for illustrative purposes, we consider a gas turbine 
combustor, afterburner, and ramjet. In every case, the fuel is repre- 
sented as n-dodecane. While other fuels could be considered (e.g., 
more realistic jet fuels, methane, hydrogen, etc.), we do not expect 
a qualitative change in the parameter space encompassed on the 
regime diagrams. 8  In the gas turbine combustor and ramjet, the 
fuel is mixed with fresh air; in the afterburner, fuel is mixed with 
appropriately diluted combustion products. Even though these de- 
vices  would  be  partially  premixed  in  reality,  we  represent  them 
as perfectly premixed. We take 10 mm ≤ (cid:2) ≤ 20 mm to represent 
a characteristic integral scale in each device. The other properties 
used in these calculations are provided in Table 1 and are based on 
typical approximate operating parameters, e.g., Ref. [102] .The spe- 
ciﬁc  operating points  shown in  Fig.  9  are taken  from  a  uniform 
sampling of conditions over the range shown in the table. While 
other parameters could be selected, they are not expected to make 
qualitative changes to the results. We note that there is a minor 
discrepancy between the location of the engine points relative to 
the constant Ka δ, K lines in Fig. 9 (a) versus Fig. 9 (b). This arises be- 
cause Re (cid:2) is calculated using νr , whereas the constant Ka δ, K lines 
are calculated assuming that νr is equal to both the molecular and 
thermal diffusivity. 

The  majority  of  the  conditions  lie  between  1 ≤ Ka δ, K ≤ 100 . 
No conditions approach the range Ka δ, K > 10 0 0 . All conﬁgurations 
have (cid:2) (cid:9) δ0 
L  and, therefore, do not approach the distributed reac- 
tion regime predicted by Williams. Such conditions would require 
very broad ﬂames (e.g., low pressures or highly diluted preheated 
reactants)  and/or  small  integral  scales.  Combustion  of  highly  di- 
luted premixed reactants is associated with moderate or intense 
low-oxygen dilution (MILD), ﬂameless, or colorless combustion sys- 
tems, which are reviewed elsewhere [103,104] . The focus here is 
largely on combustion in the parameter space around the points 
shown in Fig. 9 , though we also include some studies at higher

Hydrogen may shift the parameter space to lower Karlovitz numbers for the 

ﬂows speciﬁed here, but may also accommodate higher ﬂow speeds.

2.4.3. Comments on regimes 

Despite the placement of the various points on the regime di- 
agrams, it is not clear that the parameters employed or the lines 
drawn are suﬃcient to fully characterize the mutual interactions 
between  turbulence  and  ﬂames  for  several  reasons.  This  section 
discusses these issues and recent results, and provides some rec- 
ommendations on the use of regimes and regime diagrams. 

To  begin,  a  comment  is  warranted  regarding  lines  based  on 
Ka δ, K or λK . The Kolomogrov length-scale is obtained purely from 
dimensional arguments. However, measurements and simulations 
in constant density turbulent ﬂows have shown that the actual ob- 
served smallest scales (denoted λν due to their connection to the 
kinematic  viscosity  ν)  are  proportional  to  λK ,  but  several  times 
larger (values in the range of λν ≈ 5 λK are often reported) [90–93] . 
Such a difference would signiﬁcantly impact the parameter space 
at which different regimes/behaviors are expected. For example, if 
the K-W condition is modiﬁed to be λν ≤ δ0 
L  with λν ≈ 5 λK , this 
would indicate that modiﬁcation of the ﬂame structure could be 
expected around Ka δ, K ≈ 25 . Furthermore, if c K = 0 . 5 , this would 
(cid:5)−1 
(cid:4)
be Ka δ, K ≈ 50 . If νr 
L δ0 
s 0 
≈ 0 . 2 , this would instead correspond to 
L 
Ka δ, K ≈ 5 or 10. Similar to the K-W criterion, it can be argued that 
the effects of small scale turbulence on the reaction zone struc- 
ture should occur at considerably higher Karlovitz numbers than 
Ka δ, K = 100 because λν > λK . The purpose of this discussion is not 
to propose moving the K-W line to Ka δ, K = 5 , 25, or some other 
number,  but  simply  to  highlight  a  potential  order-of-magnitude 
disagreement between the physical reasoning behind some regime 
boundaries  and  the  practical  realization  of  the  effects  in  exper- 
iments  and  simulations.  One,  therefore,  should  not  be  surprised 
when  experimental  or  DNS  results  do  not  show  transitions  be- 
tween regimes at the conditions predicted by the theoretical ar- 
guments underlying regime diagrams (or even within an order of 
magnitude). 

In  addition  to  this  ambiguity,  it  is  not  clear  that  turbulence 
characterized at a single point (typically in the reactants) is suf- 
ﬁcient to predict a combustion regime, for several reasons. Practi- 
cal combustion devices exhibit considerable variation in both tur- 
bulence conditions and ﬂame structures. For example, Fig. 10 (a), 
shows how u (cid:2) /s 0 
L , and Ka δ, K vary with downstream distance 
( x/D ) in DNS of a highly turbulent jet ﬂame in the LUPJ conﬁg- 
uration [78,79,94] . The local values of Ka δ, K decrease with down- 
stream distance, which would indicate a decreased effect of small-

scale  turbulence.  However,  the  visual  appearance  of  the  scalar 
ﬁelds (see Fig. 10 (b)) indicates the opposite, with increased cor- 
rugation and broadening of the CH 2 O contours with downstream 
distance. The scalar ﬁelds observed in the DNS are consistent with 
experiments of the same conﬁguration [47,48] . Hence, using a sin- 
gle value of dimensionless parameters to characterize a practical 
turbulent ﬂame is insuﬃcient and the local ﬂame structure may 
not reﬂect the local characteristics of the turbulent ﬂow. 

It is worth noting that the apparent broadening of the CH 2 O 
regions  at  downstream  locations  in  Fig.  10 (b)  involves  both  the 
effects  of  local  turbulence  and  the  advection  of  turbulence- 
inﬂuenced CH 2 O from further upstream (which has also been af- 
fected by the turbulence). Since the jet ﬂow speed in these ﬂames 
is much higher than the laminar ﬂame speed, the turbulence and 
ﬂame simultaneously advect a considerable distance downstream 
before turbulence in the reactants passes into the products. Near 
the ﬂame base, the turbulence and ﬂame have not interacted for 
long and the ﬂame retains a  laminar-like structure;  towards the 
ﬂame tip, the ﬂame has “consumed” more turbulence. Hence, the 
ﬂame  structure  observed  at  higher  axial  locations  may  be  more 
consistent  with  the  expected  consequence  (i.e.,  ﬂame  structure) 
arising from the turbulence/ﬂame interactions than near the ﬂame 
base. This is somewhat analogous to the temporal evolution of a 
laminar ﬂame initial condition to the fully turbulent state during 
DNS of planar ﬂames, which requires a certain number of ﬂow- 
through times to establish the statistically steady ﬂame structure. 
Moreover, the traditional turbulence characterization does not 
account for the inﬂuence of the ﬂame on the turbulence or the de- 
tailed distribution of kinetic energy amongst scales in turbulence 
(see Section 4 for a detailed discussion). Several researchers have 
introduced new parameters or modiﬁcations to regime diagrams 
to account for these effects. For exam ple, Lapointe et al. [67] pro- 
pose to use a “reaction zone” Karlovitz number—based on the Kol- 
mogorov scale in the reaction zone and 1–2 orders of magnitude 
lower  than  Ka δ, K  due  to  the  increased  viscosity—to  characterize 
whether  turbulence  will  disrupt  the  inner  ﬂame  structure.  Asp- 
den et al. [105] argue that, at suﬃciently high Karlovitz numbers 
( Ka δ, K (cid:9) 100 ), λK  scale structures are too small compared to the 
thermochemical gradients to enhance mixing. Instead, a metric is 
proposed that is similar to a Karlovitz number, but uses the turbu- 
lence time-scale at δ0 
L . 

Recent  evidence,  reviewed  by  Driscoll  et  al.  [11] ,  also  has 
brought  into  question  the  conventional  regime  diagrams  and 
boundaries. In particular, they indicate that experiments and DNS 
at  Ka δ, K ≥ 1  may  or  may  not  exhibit  preheat  zone  broadening, 
depending  on  Re (cid:2) .  This  is  demonstrated  in  Fig.  11  from  Skiba 
et al. [58] , which shows that Ka δ, K ≥ 1 is necessary but not suf- 
ﬁcient for broadening of the preheat zone to occur. In the exper- 
imental data, the division between broadened preheat zones/thin 
reaction zones (BP-TR) and thin ﬂamelets requires an effective “tur- 
bulent diffusivity” ( D T ) of 180 times the characteristic molecular 
diffusivity ( D ∗). Based on scaling arguments, Driscoll et al. [11] pro- 
posed that this corresponds to a boundary of Re (cid:2) (cid:2) 2800 and that 
this value was necessary to observe preheat layer broadening (this 
value assumes unity scaling factors in all relationships). However, 
the DNS studies in Fig. 11 indicate broadened preheat zones for 
lower D T / D ∗, but only at Ka δ, K (cid:2) 60 . We note that “turbulent dif- 
fusivity” is a modeling concept that is meant to statistically reﬂect 
the increased molecular mixing rate generated by turbulence; it is 
not a physical process affecting the instantaneous dynamics of ve- 
locity or scalar according to Eqs. (1) –(4) . 

Broadened  reactions  are  observed  for  DNS  and  some  experi- 
ments, although other experiments do not observe broadened re- 
actions at similar Karlovitz numbers. In particular, broadened reac- 
tions in Fig. 11 (black and blue stars) occur at smaller (cid:2)/δ0 
L than the 
experimental BP-TR points at similar Karlovitz numbers (ﬁlled red

ened preheat zones and thin reactions were observed. Reprinted from Ref. [58] with

squares). The majority of the black stars were obtained in the LUPJ 
burner with (cid:2)/δ0 
L (cid:4) 10 [47] , whereas the red dots were obtained in 
the Michigan Hi-Pilot burner with (cid:2)/δ0 
L (cid:2) 10 [58] . Indeed, broad- 
ened reactions occur for Da (cid:2),δ (cid:4) 1 and BP-TR occur for Da (cid:2),δ (cid:2) 1 , 
at  least  to  Ka δ, K ≈ 550  in  the  Hi-Pilot  burner.  We  note  that  the 
DNS and experimental cases with broadened reactions were omit- 
ted from the regime diagram in Driscoll et al. [11] , although the 
other data in Ref. [11] is identical to that of Skiba et al. [58] . 

As a ﬁnal comment, the terms “broadened preheat”, “thin re- 
action”,  “broadened  reaction”,  etc.  in  the  Borghi/Peters  diagram 
are somewhat limiting. These terms apply most readily to ﬂames 
that  posses  a  relatively  broad  and  inert  preheat  zone,  followed 
by  a  thin  reaction  zone.  Fig.  2  demonstrates  that  this  structure 
is  most  relevant  to  ﬂames  for  relatively  simple  hydrocarbon  fu- 
els  (e.g.,  CH 4 );  hydrogen ﬂames  possess  an  exothermic  structure 
throughout,  whereas  large  hydrocarbon  ﬂames  possess  an  en- 
dothermic fuel pyrolysis zone coincident with the “preheat” zone. 
The Williams diagram avoids these issues by not prescribing labels 
to the parameter space between ﬂame sheets and broadened reac- 
tions. 

More broadly applicable labels could be applied to the various 
regions of the regime diagrams. As mentioned above and discussed 
in more detail in Sections 3 and 4 , a laminar-like ﬂame structure 
implies a correlation between different scalar values and between 
values  of  a  scalar  and  its  gradient.  The  boundary  Ka δ, K (cid:2) 1  may 
more  generally  be  conceived  as  the  conditions  at  which  turbu- 
lence in the reactants has scales that can disrupt the correlation of 
scalars that are distributed over lengths similar to O(δ0 
L ) , whether 
or not reactions are occurring. Similarly, Ka δ, K (cid:2) 100 may more ac- 
curately be considered the condition at which turbulence in the re- 
actants has scales that could disrupt the correlation of scalars that 
are distributed over lengths similar to O(0 . 1 δ0 
L ) . 

In total, the observations described above highlight some of the 
limitations of regime diagrams, namely: (a) the scale-based argu- 
ments  used  to  prescribe  regime  boundaries  may  have  order-of- 
magnitude quantitative differences with the physical scales present

in turbulent ﬂames; (b) they do not account for spatial inhomo- 
geneity and the advection of ﬂame structures; (c) they do not ac- 
count for the inﬂuence of the ﬂame on the turbulence; (d) regime 
labels that distinguish between preheat and reaction zones are re- 
strictive in terms of fuels; and (e) additional length/velocity/time 
scales may be needed to predict regimes. Despite these limitations, 
regime diagrams provide a useful conceptual/academic aid for un- 
derstanding and articulating the general inﬂuences of turbulence 
on ﬂames as a function of conditions (it can be argued that this 
was their original intent). They can also provide conservative a pri- 
ori guidance on appropriate/eﬃcient modelling paradigms for clos- 
ing reaction source terms for a given conﬁguration/condition, al- 
though recent developments on adaptive modeling provide an al- 
ternative path (e.g., Ref. [106] ). However, the utility of comparing 
the detailed regime transitions between different conﬁgurations is 
limited. 

2.5. Turbulent ﬂame speed 

We close this introductory section with a brief review of the 
current understanding of the turbulent ﬂame speed in highly tur- 
bulent  ﬂames.  The  turbulent  ﬂame  speed  is  a  convenient  over- 
all  metric  of  a  ﬂame  that  captures  the  net  effects  of  the  com- 
plicated  turbulence/ﬂame  interactions.  Comparisons  of  turbulent 
ﬂame speeds to theoretical expectations—e.g., based on a collection 
of thin propagating ﬂame surfaces—can be used to assess theories 
and help identify open questions. Models for the turbulent ﬂame 
speed can also be used to close the reaction rate source term, as 
reviewed by Lipatnikov and Chomiak [6] . 

Driscoll  [8]  presents  a  review  of  the  turbulent  ﬂame  speed, 
its  deﬁnitions,  ambiguities  in  these  deﬁnitions,  and  measure- 
ments/simulations in the ﬂamelet regime. Of particular relevance 
here is the global consumption speed 

s T , GC ≡

¯˙ m r 
, 
ρr A ¯c =0 . 5 

(15) 

where  ¯˙ m r is the mean mass ﬂow rate of reactants consumed by the 
ﬂame and A 
¯c =0 . 5 is the area of the surface corresponding to a mean 
reaction  progress  variable  of  ¯c = 0 . 5 .  This  surface  roughly  repre- 
sents the midpoint of the ﬂame brush. Experimentally, envelope 
ﬂames (e.g., jet and Bunsen ﬂames) without local extinction allow 
direct calculation of s T , GC because  ¯˙ m r and ρr are known, and A 
¯c =0 . 5 
can be reasonably measured. In DNS, s T , GC  can be calculated di- 
rectly from the simulated reaction rates and/or from reactant mass 
ﬂow rates. 

Under the assumption that a turbulent premixed ﬂame consists 
of  a  collection  of  thin  1D  propagating  ﬂame  structures  that  are 
similar to stretched laminar deﬂagrations, we obtain 
¯˙ m r = ρr s T , GC A ¯c =0 . 5 = ρr ¯I 0 ¯s 0

where  ¯A T is the mean area of a selected c isosurface and  ¯I 0 is an 
O(1) factor that accounts for the effects of stretch of the ﬂame 
speed. Hence,

where we have taken A 
¯c =0 . 5 to characterize the area of an “equiva- 
lent” laminar ﬂame (i.e., one with the same area as the mean ﬂame 
brush, which would be exactly true for statistically 1D ﬂames). 

It is common practice to plot s T , GC versus u (cid:2) , both normalized 
by s 0 
L . However, as discussed above, caution must be applied when 
considering the laminar ﬂame properties attributed to highly tur- 
bulent combustion experiments due to the tendency to mix sur- 
rounding ﬂuid into the reaction zone [59,65] . Unless this ambient

ﬂuid is thermo-chemically matched to the products of the reac- 
tants, the laminar ﬂame speed of the reactants may not properly 
characterize the ﬂame. 

The data of Wabel et al. [56] were acquired in the Hi-Pilot Bun- 
sen ﬂame across a range of turbulence conditions (up to u (cid:2) /s 0 
L ≈
150 ), all with equal jet and pilot equivalence ratios of φ = 0 . 75 . 
Fig. 12 summarizes their ﬁndings, which also includes the results 
of Yuen and Gülder [52] for u (cid:2) /s 0 
L (cid:4) 25 . The mean progress variable 
ﬁeld was estimated by binarizing instantaneous OH planar laser- 
induced  ﬂuorescence  (PLIF)  images  and  then  taking  the  average. 
The turbulent ﬂame surface area was estimated from the instanta- 
neous PLIF images. 

Values of s T , GC /s 0 

L > 25 were observed. These increased contin- 
uously, but at a decreasing rate with increasing u (cid:2) . The maximum 
in s T , GC from previous studies at lower turbulence intensities was 
not  observed  [107] ,  which  is  attributed  to  the  large  co-ﬂow  of 
hot  pilot  ﬂuid  that  prevented  local  ﬂame  extinction.  In  contrast 
to the continuously increasing s T , GC , measured values of  ¯A T /A 
¯c =0 . 5 
(denoted S T , F /S L in Fig. 12 ) increased for low u (cid:2) but plateaued at 
¯A T /A 

¯c =0 . 5 ≈ 5 . 
We note that comparing the measured  ¯A T /A 

¯c =0 . 5  with s T , GC / s 0 
L 
via Eq. (17) requires consideration of the stretch factor I 0 . However, 
the φ = 0 . 75 methane/air ﬂame studied has a near-zero Markstein 
length,  resulting  in  I 0 ≈ 1  and  indicating  that  the  laminar  ﬂame 
speed should decrease slightly with increasing stretch rate due to 
turbulence [108] . Hence, ﬂame stretch would increase the discrep- 
ancy between the measured turbulent ﬂame speed and the con- 
sumption rate expected from the ﬂame area and stretched laminar 
ﬂame speed. 

Imaging of  CH 2 O and  OH using  PLIF  in  these  ﬂames  demon- 
strated broadened regions of CH 2 O , but topologically thin and con- 
nected regions of exothermic reactions (identiﬁed from the over- 
lap of CH 2 O and OH ). There was thus no evidence of broken or 
broadened reaction zones.  Hence, these experiments provide ev- 
idence  of  increased  reaction  rates  while  maintaining  a  reaction 
zone spatial structure that qualitatively remains similar to that of 
a  laminar  ﬂame.  This  is  consistent  with  the  observations  of  Os- 
borne et al. [55] , who experimentally showed increased local ﬂame 
speeds  in  regions  of  thickened  preheat  zones  and  thin  reaction 
zones.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 85 (2021) 10 090 0 

Other experimental evidence supports this general conclusion. 
For example, Wang et al. [50] reported s T , GC /s 0 
L  measurements in 
the LUPJ jet burner. If the area of the turbulent ﬂame was calcu- 
lated using the area of the CH 2 O surface, their data corresponded 
very  well  with  that  of  Wabel  et  al.  [56] .  However,  the  ﬂames 
used in this study had mismatched pilot and jet equivalence ra- 
tios. There consequently may be some ambiguity in the proper s 0 
L 
normalization factor. 

Another  study  by  Sosa  et  al.  [64]  presented  turbulent  ﬂame 
speeds  in  a  planar  ﬂame  propagating  into  a  heated  ﬂow  at  a 
suﬃcient  velocity  for  ﬂuid  compressibility  to  have  an  inﬂuence. 
Since the ﬂame was stationary in the laboratory frame, the tur- 
bulent ﬂame speed was determined directly from the velocity of 
the  oncoming  reactants.  They  reported  s T , GC /s 0 
L  values  above  60. 
While ﬂame surface areas were not measured, it is expected that 
¯A T /A 

¯c =0 . 5 is considerably less than s T , GC /s 0 
L . 
In contrast to the experiments, most DNS of ﬂames in boxes of 
homogeneous isotropic turbulence ﬁnd much lower s T , GC /s 0 
L values 
than experiments at similar u (cid:2) /s 0 
L . Furthermore, the DNS studies 
often ﬁnd that s T , GC /s 0 
L  is very similar to  ¯A T /A 
¯c =0 . 5 [71,109] . Typi- 
cal results are shown in Fig. 13 . It should be noted that the stud- 
ies shown in Fig. 13 utilized single-step chemistry, which may be 
insuﬃcient to describe the effects of stretch on the ﬂame speed. 
Nevertheless,  the  simulations  of  Nivarti  and  Cant  [71]  utilized  a 
φ = 1 . 0 methane/air ﬂame that should be relatively insensitive to 
stretch. 

Regarding the higher values of s T , GC /s 0 

L  for a given  ¯A T /A L mea- 
sured in experiments, one potential explanation is that the experi- 
ments are over-measuring s T , GC or under-measuring  ¯A T . The former 
is unlikely since the mass ﬂow rate of reactants and reactant den- 
sity  can  generally  be  well  controlled  in  experiments.  As  long  as 
there is not substantial local extinction—which is prevented by the 
large co-ﬂow of hot products in most conﬁgurations— ¯˙ m r is known. 
The use of the  ¯c = 0 . 5 isosurface area to normalize the reactant 
ﬂux in Eq. (16) is arbitrary and affects the reported values of s T , GC . 
Given that the density of the unburnt reactants is used to com- 
pute the reactant volume ﬂux, it may be more appropriate to use 
a  ¯c isosurface towards the reactant side of the ﬂame brush. How- 
ever, in the jet and Bunsen ﬂames studied, this would reduce the 
normalizing surface area and further increase the reported s T , GC . 

¯c =0 . 5  (nor  the  much  higher  values  of  s T , GC /s 0 

While  it  is  likely  that  experiments  are  under-estimating  ¯A T , 
this cannot account for the large discrepancy between s T , GC /s 0 
L and 
¯A T /A 
L  in  the  experi- 
ments compared to the DNS). Such under-estimation arises primar- 
ily due to resolution limitations and the use of two-dimensional 
(2D)  measurements  to  estimate  3D  ﬂame  areas.  These  effects 
have been evaluated in several recent studies. For example, Wa- 
bel et al. [111] post-processed DNS data to mimic the experimental 
signal collection process. They found that the measurement pro- 
cess decreased the measured area, but the decrease was limited to 
about a 10-30% under-estimation over a reasonable range of ex- 
perimental  parameters.  Similarly,  Wang  et  al.  [112]  showed  that 
2D measurements tend to under-predict ﬂame areas by about 30%. 
Wang  et  al.  [50]  post-processed  their  experimental  data  in  the 
LUPJ burner using two different effective pixel sizes. While they 
did ﬁnd some sensitivity of the measured ﬂame area to the pixel 
size, this was insuﬃcient to compensate for the difference between 
s T , GC /s 0 
¯c =0 . 5 .  Skiba  et  al.  [113]  experimentally  demon- 
strated that a six-fold decrease in resolution reduced the measured 
ﬂame area by approximately 30%. Klein et al. [114] used DNS of 
H 2 /air  ﬂames  and  showed  some  sensitivity  of  ﬂame  area  calcu- 
lated using scalar isosurfaces to that deduced by the generalized 
ﬂame surface density, depending on the choice of scalar, progress 
variable  level,  and  number  of  dimensions  considered.  Similar  to 
the  other  studies,  these  sensitivities  were  insuﬃcient  to  explain 
the  discrepancy  between  the  experimentally  observed  turbulent 

L  and  ¯A T /A

ﬂame speed and ﬂame area. Hence, while experiments may under- 
measure the ﬂame area, this is insuﬃcient to account for the dif- 
ferences between s T , GC /s 0 

L and  ¯A T /A 

¯c =0 . 5 . 

The experiments therefore show an increase in the local ﬂame 
propagation  speed,  such  that  a  given  amount  of  area  consumes 
more reactants per unit time than would be expected in a laminar 
ﬂame, which does not occur in the DNS. This allows the turbulent 
ﬂame  speed  to  increase  by  more  than  would  be  possible  based 
on ﬂame surface area. One potential explanation is that there is 
a large-scale (geometry dependent and/or high Reynolds number) 
effect that is not captured in the DNS. For example, ﬂame merg- 
ing has been shown to cause an increase in the local consump- 
tion  rate  [115–118] ,  which  would  be  more  prevalent  in  jet  and 
Bunsen  ﬂames  (see  Fig.  10 a)  and  in  ﬂames  with  larger  integral- 
scale corrugations than in most DNS conﬁgurations. Another po- 
tential  explanation  is  based  on  enhanced  mixing  due  to  ﬂame- 
scale turbulence. A recent study by Nivarti et al. [119] has inves- 
tigated whether the s T , GC discrepancy can be attributed to the si- 

14

multaneous action of increased turbulent diffusivity and ﬂame area 
increase (i.e., if Damköhler’s ﬁrst and second hypothesis [99] are 
acting concurrently), which is similar to the arguments made by 
Osborne  et  al.  [55] .  Using  a  model  spectrum,  they  showed  that 
the increase in s T , GC /s L relative to A T /A 
¯c =0 . 5 in experiments could 
be reconciled by an increase in the “turbulent diffusivity”, essen- 
tially leading to a faster local ﬂame speed. However, this does not 
reconcile  the  discrepancy  between  the  experiments  and  DNS,  as 
DNS should predict the local ﬂame behavior if the chemistry and 
transport are suﬃciently modelled. Thus, understanding the rea- 
sons for this discrepancy remains an area of active research and is 
discussed further in Section 3 . 

2.6. Summary 

The main takeaways from the discussion in Section 2 are: 

1. The idealized separation of laminar premixed deﬂagrations into 
inert preheat zones and chemically active reaction zones is only 
appropriate for a limited range of fuels (e.g., methane). Concep- 
tualizations of turbulent ﬂames that rely on this separation may 
face challenges for other fuels, such as hydrogen or large hydro- 
carbons. 

2. Experimental  conﬁgurations  to  study  highly  turbulent  ﬂames 
should isolate the region being investigated from the surround- 
ings using either physical conﬁnement or a co-ﬂow that is ther- 
mochemically  matched  to  the  environment.  Otherwise,  rapid 
turbulence-induced mixing can stratify the reaction zones with 
ﬂuid from the surroundings. 

3. DNS can provide valuable insights into ﬂame structure and dy- 
namics at highly turbulent conditions, and modern calculations 
now routinely use multi-step reduced or skeletal chemical ki- 
netic models. Caution must, however, be used when developing 
insights from such studies, since DNS still requires substantial 
simpliﬁcations as compared to experiments and often includes 
models for large-scale kinetic energy input. 

4. Signiﬁcant ambiguity can exist in the calculation of the dimen- 
sionless parameters used to characterize turbulent ﬂames, de- 
pending on where certain parameters are measured and what 
assumptions are made. We recommend the use of Eqs. (13) and 
(14) to calculate Da (cid:2),δ and Ka δ, K , respectively. 

5. There is a natural mitigation of extremely high Karlovitz num- 
bers and low Damköhler numbers in terrestrial systems of en- 
gineering interest due to the linkage between system tempera- 
ture and pressure. 

6. While  regime  diagrams  provide  a  useful  academic  and  con- 
ceptual  aid  for  understanding  the  effects  of  turbulence  on 
ﬂame structures, their utility for accurately predicting the ﬂame 
structure in real ﬂames based on a small number of character- 
istic parameters is questionable. Ambiguities arise due to the 
parameters  used  to  deﬁne  regime  boundaries  (particularly  in 
ﬂames with spatially varying turbulence and ﬂame structures), 
the impact of the ﬂame on the turbulence, the lack of inert pre- 
heat zones when burning many fuels, the smallest turbulence 
scales  being  much  smaller  than  the  smallest  thermochemical 
scales, etc. 

7. Despite signiﬁcant progress in both experiments and DNS, phe- 
nomenological disagreements still exist in the relationship be- 
tween turbulent ﬂame speed and ﬂame surface area that are 
not explained by experimental uncertainty.

The major focus of this section is on characterizing the local 
thermochemical  state  and  associated  source  terms  during  highly 
turbulent premixed combustion. Although we discuss the spatial 
structure of the ﬂame—and, hence, the scalar gradients and molec- 
ular  transport—where  appropriate,  scalar  gradient  dynamics  are 
closely linked to turbulence dynamics. As such, much of the dis- 
cussion regarding scalar gradient dynamics in turbulent ﬂames is 
deferred to Section 4.2 . 

From the perspective of the thermochemical state space, the at- 
tainable states in a highly turbulent premixed ﬂame are more var- 
ied than in a laminar ﬂame, due to the larger range of scalar gra- 
dients  and  associated  time  scales.  To  investigate  their  effects,  in 
Section 3.1 we ﬁrst describe the structure of highly turbulent pre- 
mixed ﬂames from the perspective of their characteristics in phys- 
ical  space.  The  thermochemical  states  observed  in  highly  turbu- 
lent premixed ﬂames, and the associated reaction rates, are subse- 
quently described in Section 3.2 . Given the impacts of turbulence 
on thermochemical states in highly turbulent ﬂames, we discuss 
potential deviations from the chemical pathways observed in lam- 
inar ﬂames in Section 3.3 . Chemical pathways are closely related 
to local combustion modes, and we discuss the classiﬁcation and 
quantiﬁcation of these modes in Section 3.4 . A brief summary is 
provided in Section 3.5 . 

3.1. Flame structure in physical space 

In  studies  that  focus  on  high  Karlovitz  number  premixed 
ﬂames,  the  ﬂame  structure  is  frequently  probed  and  described; 
Fig. 1 in Ref. [120] provides a comprehensive summary of these 
studies and their corresponding Karlovitz numbers. Both computa- 
tional and experimental studies [53,55,56,66,67,78,86,105,113,121–
127]  have  compared  turbulent  premixed  ﬂames  at  high  Ka δ, K  to 
corresponding laminar ﬂames in physical space, with the primary 
goal  of  assessing  whether  “ﬂame  broadening” is  observed  un- 
der highly turbulent conditions. This topic is comprehensively re- 
viewed in Ref. [11] and, hence, is not discussed in detail here. 

A challenge when considering turbulent ﬂame spatial structure 
is that phenomenological observations of thinning or broadening 
are  often  qualitative  and  depend  on  the  deﬁnitions  of  “preheat”
and “reaction” zones. Such deﬁnitions are often not uniﬁed across 
studies, as is evident by the various isolines or radical layers em- 
ployed in Refs. [56,67,127] . 

To avoid complications arising from such different deﬁnitions, 
the physical structure of ﬂames can be re-cast into a consideration 
of scalar ﬁeld dynamics. In particular, for a scalar that character- 
izes the location of the ﬂame (e.g., the temperature), a scalar ﬁeld 
with dimensions of length can be deﬁned based on the local scalar 
gradient magnitude χ ≡ (χ

k ) 1 / 2 as [128,129]

3. Thermochemical structure and dynamics 

The objective of this section is to report current information re- 
garding the thermochemical structure and dynamics of highly tur- 
bulent premixed ﬂames. Extending Eq. (4) for chemical scalars to 

ref  denotes a reference change in ψ (e.g., the differ- 
where ((cid:20)ψ ) 
ence in product and reactant temperatures when ψ = T ). In the 
case of an unstretched laminar ﬂame where ψ = T  and χ is eval- 
uated at the location of the maximum gradient, δt = δ0 
L . A primary 
advantage of the scalar gradient approach to understanding ﬂame 
structure is that ψ and δt are both ﬁeld quantities that have exact,

physics-based governing equations. Such equations directly reveal 
the dynamics of the ﬁelds – both globally and locally – even for 
highly turbulent conditions where the concept of a quasi-laminar 
coherent ﬂamelet may be lost (see Section 4.2.1 ). 

Fig.  14  shows  examples  of  probability  density  functions  and 
conditional statistics of δt evaluated at different locations in highly 
turbulent premixed ﬂames, as characterized by a progress variable, 
ψ = c, or reactant mass fraction, ψ = Y . These results show that 
a wide range of δt —both thinner and thicker than the correspond- 
ing laminar ﬂame—can occur at any position within the ﬂame for 
highly turbulent conditions. As the turbulence intensity increases, 
the ﬂuid dynamic strain rate locally increases thermochemical gra- 
dients and decreases the width of high-gradient structures, result- 
ing in broad regions of reduced gradients; that is, the dynamics 
lead to small regions of intense scalar gradients with intervening 
broad regions of low gradients. Hence, the overall ﬂame width in- 
creases  while  strong  gradients—higher  than  those  found  in  lam- 
inar  ﬂames—are  concentrated.  This  behavior  is  demonstrated  in 
Fig. 15 from both experiments and DNS [78,130] , and is likely due 
to a combination of two related effects. In particular, for the larger 
Reynolds numbers found in many highly turbulent conﬁgurations, 
internal intermittency, which is associated with the concentration 
of velocity gradients into an increasingly small volume of the ﬂow, 
becomes more pronounced. At the same time, the turbulent ve- 
locity ﬁeld itself has an increasingly dominant effect on the scalar 
dynamics,  and  the  scalar  ﬁeld  begins  to  reﬂect  the  intermittent 
properties  of  the  turbulence.  Although  disentangling  the  relative 
contributions of these effects on the scalar intermittency remains

a subject of active research, both are responsible in some measure 
for the  increasing concentration  of  strong scalar  gradients noted 
above. Internal intermittency in the context of turbulence structure 
and dynamics is discussed in more detail in Sections 4.2.3 and 4.3 . 
Another factor complicating the structure of a turbulent ﬂame 
is the potential for reactions occurring throughout the ﬂame, (i.e., 
the lack of chemically inert preheat zones). As demonstrated by 
the  proﬁles  of  the  unstrained  laminar  ﬂames  in  Fig.  2 ,  an  in- 
ert region of diffusive mixing generally does not occur upstream 
of highly exothermic reactions when considering detailed elemen- 
tary chemical reactions. For example, signiﬁcant endothermic fuel 
cracking  reactions  (due  to  pyrolysis)  occur  in  the  preheat  zone 
for dodecane/air ﬂames. Exothermic reactions can also take place 
throughout hydrogen/air ﬂames, in a region that is broader than 
the fuel consumption region due to differential diffusion. 

Strong turbulence can further complicate the concept of a pre- 
heat  zone  if  ﬂames  locally  extinguish.  In  such  situations,  turbu- 
lent advection can rapidly stir hot products into the preheat zone, 
from which enthalpy and species subsequently diffuse. One man- 
ifestation  of  this  is  the  presence  of  product  “pockets” that  are 
separated from reactants by extinguishing ﬂame surfaces (i.e., iso- 
surfaces with zero or negative displacement speed). Such pockets 
were  observed  in  all  DNS  of  n-dodecane/air  ﬂames  at  Karlovitz 
numbers  from  100  to  10,0 0 0  [66] ,  as  visualized  by  the  blue  re- 
gions in Fig. 16 (b). The presence of pockets complicates the phys- 
ical space structure of the ﬂame, as well as the thermochemical 
structure and reaction rates (see Section 3.3.2 ). We also note that 
reactant pockets can be formed in the products, as visualized by 
the red regions in Fig. 16 (b).

As  mentioned  in  Section  2.4.3 ,  the  distinction  between  the 
preheat  zones  and  reaction  zones  becomes  unhelpful  for  highly 
turbulent  ﬂames,  particularly  when  considering  fuels  other  than 
methane.  Terminologies  such  as  “volumes  of  reacting  ﬂuids” or 
“volumes  of  packed  ﬂame  ﬁlaments” may  be  more  appropri- 
ate  [70,121] .  Consequently,  traditional  experimental  and  compu- 
tational  diagnostics  and  models  can  be  insuﬃcient  and/or  inap- 
propriate in describing the ﬂame structures under these challeng- 
ing conditions where clear interfaces between fresh mixture and 
products cease to exist. We will further elaborate on this point in 
Sections 3.2 and 3.3.1 . 

3.2. Flame structure in thermochemical space 

The  ability  of  turbulence  to  alter  the  spatial  distribution  of 
scalars in physical space is associated with changes in scalar gradi- 
ents. This, in turn, alters the rate of molecular transport processes 
responsible  for  scalar  mixing,  ultimately  resulting  in  changes  to 
scalar source terms (i.e., chemical reaction rates). This section re- 
views changes in the thermochemical states observed in highly tur- 
bulent premixed ﬂames. 

3.2.1. Non-unity Lewis number effects 

Molecular  transport  is  the  fundamental  process  that  mixes 
scalars at the molecular level, which is necessary for chemical re- 
actions.  Turbulent  advection  alters  the  gradients  that  drive  this 
process, but any differences in transport properties between dif- 
ferent  scalars  remain.  Nevertheless,  there  is  a  phenomenological 
understanding that differences in transport properties become less 
signiﬁcant, in a practical sense, as turbulence intensity increases. 
Physically,  this  should  be  interpreted  as  the  creation  of  a  state 
that appears to have uniform transport properties in some statisti- 
cal sense (i.e., in an average or ﬁltered ﬁeld), due to rapid spatio- 
temporal variations in the magnitude and orientation of scalar gra- 
dients. Therefore, statistically, differences between diffusion coeﬃ- 
cients  for  various  species  and  heat  are  expected  to  become  less 
signiﬁcant under highly turbulent conditions. With such an expec- 
tation,  effects  due  to  varying  Lewis  number  ( Le = α/ D)  are  fre- 

quently examined and discussed in the literature on highly turbu- 
lent premixed ﬂames  [67,69,83,86,122,131,132] . 

Before we discuss the relevant ﬁndings, we wish to clarify some 
terminology commonly employed to describe molecular and ther- 
mal transport; namely, preferential diffusion, differential diffusion, 
and Lewis number effects. Pref erential diffusion is conventionally 
employed to indicate different molecular diffusivities for different 
species (i.e., D 
A (cid:11) = D B ) in a multi-component chemical system [5] . 
Similarly, the term “non-unity Lewis number effect” convention- 
ally indicates that the molecular diffusivity of species A is different 
A (cid:11) = α). 
from the thermal diffusivity of the local gas mixture (i.e., D 
For  a  multi-component  reacting  mixture,  the  global  Lewis  num- 
ber  is  often  deﬁned  based  on  the  deﬁcient  species  in  the  fresh 
mixture [5] , although an individual Lewis number can be deﬁned 
for  each  species.  Consequently,  the  term  “non-unity  Lewis num- 
ber effect” alone can be ambiguous and more clariﬁcation is usu- 
ally needed to elucidate its exact meaning. Differential diffusion, 
similar to “non-unity Lewis number effects”, is also used liberally 
in the literature; it has been used as a synonym to “preferential 
diffusion” [133,134] or “non-constant non-unity Lewis number ef- 
fects” [67,83,122,132] . 

To avoid ambiguity, we recommend explicit speciﬁcation of the 
transport models where possible, so that readers can have a pre- 
cise understanding of the meaning. During discussion, more spe- 
ciﬁc descriptions are suggested, such as “differential species diffu- 
sion” or “differential diffusion between species and heat”, or con- 
sistently  reserving  “non-unity  Lewis  number  effect” for  the  de- 
scription of differential heat and species transport. 

Physically, a multi-component chemical system always has non- 
A (cid:11) = D B (cid:11) = α). Hence, the 
constant non-unity Lewis number (i.e., D 
issues  mentioned  above  are  mostly  observed  in  computational 
studies. However, physical systems can “appear” or “behave” as if 
the Lewis number were unity or no differential diffusion existed, 
to the extent observable by the experiment. Recognizing physical 
conditions that lead to such observations is beneﬁcial for model- 
ing studies. 

Although non-unity Lewis number effects are expected to de- 
crease  in  importance  with  increasing  turbulence  intensity,  they

can  remain  signiﬁcant  even  at  quite  high  turbulence  intensi- 
ties  [69,83,86,131,135] .  Aspden  et  al.  [69]  reported  the  distribu- 
tion  of  local  (atom-based)  equivalence  ratios  versus  temperature 
through DNS of hydrogen/air ﬂames from Ka δ, K = 10 to 1 . 6 × 10 3 
with inlet equivalence ratios of φ0 = 0 . 31 and 0.40 (see Fig. 17 ). 
Similar  variations  in  mean  equivalence  ratio  versus  temperature 
were observed between the Ka δ, K = 10 turbulent ﬂames and cor- 
responding laminar ﬂames for both inlet equivalence ratios, indi- 
cating the continued importance of differential diffusion. Addition- 
ally,  the  Ka δ, K = 10  ﬂames  exhibited  locations  with  mean  equiv- 
alence  ratios  greater  than  φ0  and  temperatures  above  the  adi- 
abatic  ﬂame  temperature  as  a  result  of  differential  diffusion.  At 
Ka δ, K = 1 . 6 × 10 3 , both ﬂames have different mean equivalence ra- 
tio proﬁles that remain close to φ0 , indicating a statistically de- 
creased signiﬁcance of differential diffusion. Nevertheless, the stan- 
dard deviation around the mean remains signiﬁcant compared to 
the  Ka δ, K = 10  cases,  particularly  at  φ0 = 0 . 31 .  Interestingly,  the 
φ > φ0  branch beyond the adiabatic ﬂame temperature was only 
observed for φ0 = 0 . 31 at Ka δ, K = 1 . 6 × 10 3 . 

Barlow et al. [135] measured C/H, C/O and C/N ratios for the 
Cambridge  bluff-body  stabilized  burner  with  both  streams  com- 
prised  of  methane/air  mixtures  at  φ = 0 . 75  (Case  SwB1).  The 
Reynolds  numbers  for  the  inner  and  outer  jets  were  5,960  and 
11,500,  respectively.  They  observed  varying  atomic  ratios  across 
the  turbulent  premixed  ﬂame  as  shown  in  Fig.  18 ,  which  sug- 
gests  the  role  of  differential  species  diffusion  in  these  turbu- 
lent premixed ﬂames. The same trends of atomic ratios were ob- 
served in an LES/PDF study [136] , where mixture-averaged molec- 
ular  transport  was  invoked  to  account  for  molecular  transport 
on  the  resolved  grid  only.  However,  the  subgrid  differential  dif- 

fusion  remains  unaccounted  for  in  this  study,  which  could  con- 
tribute  to  the  reported  discrepancy  between  experiments  and 
computation. 

Non-unity  Lewis  number  effects  have  also  been  delineated 
by  comparing  simulations  conducted  with  different  molecu- 
lar  transport  models  [67,83,122,127,132] .  For  example,  Lapointe 
et  al.  [67]  conducted  3D  DNS  of  forced  turbulent  planar  n- 
heptane/air  ﬂames.  The  Karlovitz  number  based  on  the  unburnt 
gases up to 1050 were studied, which corresponds to 237 when 
deﬁned  based  on  the  properties  in  the  reaction  zone.  For  each 
Karlovitz number, two transport models were compared, namely a 
unity Lewis number model and a non-unity Lewis number model 
that  was  obtained  from  an  unstrained  laminar  premixed  ﬂame 
simulation using full transport. 

The different transport models showed differences in the peak 
temperature  corresponding  to  the  maximum  fuel  consumption 
rate. However, such differences decreased with increasing Karlovitz 
number, indicating a weakened role of Lewis number effects. La- 
pointe et al. [67] observed higher levels of local extinction with 
non-unity Lewis number transport, which is expected because the 
response to strain and curvature can be signiﬁcantly impacted by 
transport properties [5] , thereby modifying the local extinction be- 
havior.  The  scalars  were  more  scattered  in  state  space  with  the 
non-unity  Lewis  number  model.  However,  the  mean  mass  frac- 
tions of C 2 H 4  (and other scalars) versus temperature agreed bet- 
ter  with  laminar  solutions  obtained  using  unity  Lewis  number, 
as opposed to those obtained with non-unity Lewis number. This 
supports  the  phenomenological  observation  of  decreased  effects 
of  differential  diffusion  on  the  mean  state  when  turbulence  is 
intense.

Hence,  the  aforementioned  studies  point  to  a  reduced  inﬂu- 
ence  of  non-unity  Lewis  numbers  on  the  mean  thermochemi- 
cal  state  with  increased  turbulence  intensity.  Nevertheless,  dif- 
ferential  diffusion  can  signiﬁcantly  inﬂuence  the  mean  state  at 
highly turbulent conditions, and also inﬂuences the distribution of 
states  around  the  mean.  We  note  that  non-unity  Lewis  number 
effects  have  predominantly  been  studied  in  canonical  conﬁgura- 
tions with relatively simple fuels. The impact of differential diffu- 
sion may change with composition/thermal stratiﬁcation and with 
more complicated fuels. 

3.2.2. Scalar distributions in thermochemical space 

Ultimately,  the  combination  of  molecular  diffusion  with 
turbulence-induced  scalar  gradients  and  chemical  reactions  re- 
sults  in  more  varied  thermochemical  states  compared  to  lami- 
nar  ﬂames.  Scatter  plots  or  joint  PDFs  of  two  or  three  thermo- 
chemical variables are frequently employed to examine the extent 
to which turbulence impacts the ﬂame in thermochemical space. 
The  conditional  means  of  key  thermochemical  variables  in  tur- 
bulent ﬂames are subsequently compared with proﬁles extracted 
from  corresponding  laminar  ﬂames.  Comparison  between  condi- 
tional  statistics  in  turbulent  ﬂames  with  laminar  solutions  have 
been comprehensively discussed in Section 3.1 of Ref. [11] . Hence, 
we only present some typical results that are useful for motivat- 
ing/understanding the subsequent discussion of reaction rates and 
chemical pathways. 

Fig. 19 shows scatter plots of the mass fractions of HO 2 , OH , 
and  CH 3  obtained  from  a  3D  simulation  of  a  premixed  Jet-A/air 
ﬂame kernel subjected to intense turbulence [87] . The scatter plots 
are colored by a temperature-based progress variable in the range 
between 0.84 and 0.92, representing the transition from the pre- 
heat to the reaction zone. Compared to the corresponding laminar 
solution, which is essentially a 1D manifold, the OH - CH 3 - HO 2 mass 
fraction space for the turbulent ﬂame is larger and 3D. In particu- 
lar, CH 3 penetrates into the reaction zone in the turbulent ﬂames, 
while there is zero CH 3 beyond c = 0 . 84 in the corresponding lam- 
inar ﬂame. Reactions such as CH 3 + OH = CH ∗
2 +HO 2 are expected 
to have faster reaction rates with CH 3 exposed to higher temper- 
atures, which can potentially impact the global burning rate and 
chemical pathway. 

The thermochemical space also has been explored in the ex- 
periments  and  DNS  of  the  LUPJ  burner  over  the  range  Ka δ, K = 
O(10) − O(1 , 0 0 0) [47,78] . In the experiments, OH and CH 2 O were 
measured  by  PLIF,  and  temperature  was  measured  by  Rayleigh 
scattering. Substantial amounts of OH were observed in the low- 
temperature regions of the ﬂame (i.e., T < 1200 K), which is absent 
in the corresponding laminar ﬂame. The temperature-conditioned 
mean OH mass fractions gradually deviated from the laminar ﬂame

mixed ﬂame, colored by progress variable. The solid (black) line corresponds to the

as  Ka δ, K  was  increased.  Scatter  plots  of  a  few  important  species 
from  both  the  experiments  and  DNS  are  shown  in  Fig.  20 .  The 
DNS showed good qualitative agreement with the experiments, al- 
though there were notable differences in the shape of the scatter 
plots. For example, the simulations show more samples at low con- 
centrations of HCO and at high concentrations of CH 2 O and OH . 
The experimental results are generally more scattered in the plots 
due to noise in the measurements. Clearly, this degree of scatter 
deviates signiﬁcantly from the proﬁles that would occur in lam- 
inar ﬂames. Such wide variations in species-species and species- 
temperature correlations are ubiquitous in highly turbulent ﬂames. 
Despite the wide variation in thermochemical states, conditional 
mean proﬁles generally resemble those of laminar ﬂames at “ap- 
propriate” conditions (i.e., with a particular strain-rate and trans- 
port model) [79,132] , although a large standard deviation around 
the conditional mean is always observed. 

The wide variation of thermochemical states can challenge the 
assumptions of existing turbulent combustion closures, including 
both ﬂamelet-like and non-ﬂamelet-like models. For example, the 
LUPJ burner has been used for a priori and a posteriori assessment 
of a ﬂamelet model [137] , a thickened-ﬂame approach [138] , and a 
transported PDF approach [139] . Five different ﬂamelet tabulation 
methods  (i.e.,  “chem-tables”)  are  compared  [137] ,  including  one 
obtained using the conditional statistics from DNS, two obtained 
from  counterﬂow  stratiﬁed  premixed  1D  ﬂames  with  and  with- 
out  differential  diffusion,  one  from  freely  propagating  premixed

1D ﬂames, and one from zero-dimensional autoigniting plug-ﬂow 
reactors.  All  of  the  ﬂamelet  tables  capture  the  mean  and  root- 
mean-squared  ﬂuctuation  proﬁles  of  the  ﬂow  and  major  species 
well, with more discrepancies observed in predicting CH 2 O . How- 
ever, the ﬂamelet table based on counterﬂow stratiﬁed premixed 
1D ﬂames with differential diffusion shows better agreement with 
DNS  upstream  near  the  inlet,  while  the  ﬂamelet  table  based  on 
auto-igniting plug ﬂow predicts CH 2 O and the instantaneous ﬂame 
structure the best further downstream. That is, the ﬂamelet tables 
need to be adjusted in order to capture the local ﬂame structure. 

Similarly, the thickened ﬂame model also needs to be adapted 
to account for the local variation of thermochemical states when 
constructing the thickening factor. Compared to the traditional ap- 
proach,  where  the  thickening  factor  is  estimated  based  on  un- 
strained laminar ﬂames at corresponding boundary conditions, the 
thickening  factor  in  Ref.  [138]  accounts  for  variations  in  the  lo- 
cal hydrodynamic strain and adjusts the reference ﬂame thickness 
based  on  the  heat  release rate  layer  thickness,  subject  to  differ- 
ent  strains.  Similar  adjustments  have  also  been  implemented  in 
the context of transported PDF methods with a power-law based 
mixing frequency model [139] . One additional model constant is 
multiplied in the expression for thermal thickness of an unstrained 
laminar ﬂame in the proposed power-law scaling function, com- 
pared to an earlier version of the power law model; the new mix- 
ing model yields better agreement with DNS in predicting scalar 
mixing  rates.  Based  on  these  three  studies,  all  three  traditional 
models are applicable to the high Karlovitz number LUPJ jet ﬂame. 
However,  the  wide  distribution  of  thermochemical  states  arising 
from  strong  turbulence-chemistry  interactions  requires  modiﬁca- 
tions (e.g., estimates of the reference ﬂame thickness) in all three 
models. A future challenge lies in how to obtain the knowledge of 
thermochemical states and model their diversity a priori , when no 
DNS or experimental insights are available. 

3.3. Chemical reactions in the enlarged thermochemical space 

Responding to the enlarged thermochemical space in turbulent 
ﬂames, local reaction rates are also more varied than in laminar 

ﬂames. Indeed, the exponential relationship between reaction rate 
and  temperature  means  that  relatively  small  temperature  varia- 
tions can result in large reaction rate variations. In the following 
section, we review the impact of thermochemical states on com- 
bustion chemistry. 

3.3.1. Chemical pathways 

One of the major questions concerning highly turbulent com- 
bustion  is  whether  turbulence  alters  the  chemical  pathway  of  a 
given reactant mixture [65,87,126,140–144] . Here “chemical path- 
way” indicates a network of key elementary reactions, which could 
be the complete collection of elementary reactions for speciﬁc re- 
active mixtures at certain speciﬁc initial conditions, or  a certain 
subset thereof. For example, when heat release rates are targeted, 
the  relevant  chemical  pathway  is  tightly  connected  to  fuel  oxi- 
dation processes. For hydrocarbon fuels, the oxidation pathway is 
equivalent to tracking the major carbon ﬂow. 

Understanding such chemical pathways under highly turbulent 
conditions has practical implications for the optimization/reduction 
of chemical kinetic models. With hundreds or thousands of model 
parameters,  chemical  kinetic  models  (detailed  or  global)  require 
experimental or theoretical measurements to anchor the optimiza- 
tion  of  model  parameters.  The  experiments  are  mostly  canon- 
ical,  including  data  from  ﬂow  reactors,  laminar  ﬂame  speed 
experiments,  rapid  compression  machines,  or  shock  tubes.  For 
example,  the  GRI-Mech  mechanisms  are  optimized  based  on 
a  collection  of  reliable  experiments  that  relate  to  natural  gas 
combustion,  including  NO  formation  and  re-burn  [145] .  Turbu- 
lent  conditions  are  rarely  included  in  the  experimental  data 
sets  that  support  the  development  of  kinetic  models.  Therefore, 
it  is  of  primary  interest  to  understand  whether  optimizations 
based  on  non-turbulent  data  are  suﬃcient  to  describe  turbulent 
ﬂames. 

We note that many chemical pathway studies are constrained 
by the fact that a particular chemical mechanism was used to con- 
duct the analysis; if a certain chemical pathway is missing from 
the particular chemical mechanism, such studies are not designed 
to identify these. Meanwhile, conclusive comparisons between dif-

ferent chemical mechanisms that have different reactions are also 
diﬃcult, because of the above-mentioned optimization of chemical 
kinetic models. Therefore, caution must be taken regarding state- 
ments that the same reactions are at play when comparing two 
chemical mechanisms with different lineages. 

The chemical pathways reproduced in Fig. 21 track the carbon 
ﬂow resulting from relevant chemical reactions in the DNS of the 
LUPJ burner [65] . The numbers and thickness of the arrows indi- 
cate the fraction of carbon ﬂow through each route, and the values 
obtained from the turbulent ﬂame (black) are compared to those 
obtained from corresponding laminar ﬂames (red). Similar domi- 
nant  paths  are  observed  between  laminar  and  turbulent  ﬂames; 
the black and red numbers are, for the most part, similar. The rel- 
ative rates of the different reactions change with position; e.g., the 
CO-CO 2 conversion is shifted downstream due to the accumulation 
of CO further downstream and longer residence times required for 
this process. 

A  few  recent  DNS  studies  at  high  Karlovitz  numbers  have 
discussed  the  impact  of  turbulence  on  reaction  pathways 
through  analyses  of  reaction  ﬂuxes  [65,140,142,143] .  Dasgupta 
et  al.  [140]  analyzed  a  recent  series  of  DNS  of  lean  hydrogen- 
air  ﬂames  at  different  Karlovitz  numbers  [86]  by  analyzing  in- 
tegrated  reaction  ﬂuxes  along  local  ﬂame  normal  directions. 
They also examined methane/air ﬂames [142] and n-dodecane/air 
ﬂames  [143]  using  corresponding  DNS  datasets  [121,123] .  For  all 
three ﬂames, the conclusions remain that the fractional contribu- 
tion from each reaction to the overall heat release is not signiﬁ- 
cantly altered by turbulence. Therefore, they conclude that kinetic 
models that are optimized using laminar targets are adequate for 
describing chemistry in turbulent ﬂows. 

Recognizing the uncertainties that exist in the elemental rate 
parameters,  Zhao  et  al.  [87]  systematically  examined  the  possi- 
ble change of chemical pathways through sensitivity analysis us- 

ing 620 2D DNS of ﬂame kernels in decaying isotropic turbulence. 
Global  ﬁrst-order  and  second-order  sensitivity  analyses  [146]  of 
target quantities, such as heat release rates and CO mass fraction, 
were performed. They found that the top ten reactions that con- 
tributed to the overall heat release rate stay comparable between 
laminar and turbulent conditions, although more reactions are sen- 
sitive in the turbulent ﬂame. In particular, the chain branching re- 
action H+O 2 = OH+O and the oxidation reaction CO+OH = CO 2 +H are 
consistently predicted to be the most signiﬁcant reactions impact- 
ing heat release rates. 

Based  on  quantiﬁed  uncertainties  in  the  reaction  rates,  this 
study  also  provides  a  ranked  list  of  important  reactions  for  fur- 
ther study/reﬁnement based on their impact factor, deﬁned as the 
product of the sensitivity coeﬃcient and the uncertainty factor for 
each reaction. The sixteen most impactful reactions are shown in 
Fig. 22 . Although H+O 2 = OH+O is the most sensitive reaction, CH 3 
+ OH = CH ∗
2 + H 2 O is the most impactful reaction since it is less 
studied experimentally compared to H+O 2 = OH+O and has a larger 
uncertainty factor. Such a ranked list can provide guidance in set- 
ting priorities for obtaining more precise experimental/theoretical 
data of chemical reaction rates. 

When  pollutant  formation  is  the  primary  concern  (e.g., 
soot  [87]  or  NOx  [144] ),  the  reaction  rates  of  key  species  (e.g., 
C 2 H 2 , N 2 O, and NO 2 ) are often employed as the quantities of in- 
terest; reactions leading to production and consumption of these 
targeted species are considered components of the chemical path- 
ways. Karimkashi et al. [144] examined chemical pathways for NO 
production  in  turbulent  premixed  methane/air  ﬂames  using  2D 
DNS of freely propagating planar ﬂames for increasing turbulence 
intensities  and  with  a  reduced  mechanism  based  on  GRI-Mech 
3.0 [145] . They reported a negative net contribution of the prompt 
NO pathway under highly turbulent conditions, leading to a reduc- 
tion of NO compared to the expected prompt NO production under

low turbulence intensity and laminar conditions. The negative con- 
tribution was attributed to turbulent transport of the unburnt in- 
termediate species, such as CH 3 and CH 2 , to the high-temperature 
reaction zone. 

Zhao et al. [87] studied the sensitivity of the integrated mass of 
C 2 H 2 to gas-phase reactions, as C 2 H 2 is on the critical path to soot 
formation. They observed that the top ranked reactions contribut- 
ing to the production of C 2 H 2 are very similar between turbulent 
and laminar conditions. Interestingly, they also reported accumu- 
lated CH 3 radicals in the reaction zone under turbulent conditions, 
which is absent in the laminar counterpart. 

A common conclusion from all of the above studies with differ- 
ent fuels and methods is that, although the same underlying re- 
actions are at play, the relative importance of these reactions can 
be altered under highly turbulent conditions. This conclusion also 
indicates that calibration of chemical kinetic models should take 
into account the effects of the turbulence-enlarged thermochemi- 
cal state space. 

3.3.2. Reaction rates 

As  seen  in  the  previous  section,  relevant  reactions  for  high- 
temperature heat release are similar between laminar and turbu- 
lent  ﬂames.  Consequently,  certain  similarities  in  thermochemical 
state space are expected even when turbulence is intense, at least 
in the statistical sense. Driscoll et al. [11] review evidence and dis- 
cuss this statistical similarity in detail. Here, a few examples are 
introduced to provide a perspective on this topic. In addition, we 
highlight a few physical scenarios at which this laminar/turbulent 
similarity does not hold (e.g., product/reactant mixing at extinction 
locations). 

Different  inﬂuences  of  turbulence  on  reaction  rate  have 
been  reported,  depending  on  the  fuel.  For  example,  Aspden 
et al. [69,86] reported strong variations in the local hydrogen con- 
sumption rates for a series of hydrogen/air ﬂames, which resulted 
in an overall increase in the mean consumption rate compared to 
freely propagating 3D laminar ﬂames. Here, 3D freely propagating 
premixed laminar ﬂames are employed as reference ﬂames to in- 
clude effects of thermodiffusive instabilities that are not captured 
by  idealized  ﬂat  laminar  premixed  ﬂames  with  low  Lewis  num- 

ber  [147] .  Lapointe  et  al.  [67]  also  observed  strong  variations  in 
local fuel consumption rate for n-heptane/air ﬂames, although the 
mean fuel consumption rates were lower than the laminar counter- 
part. Sankaran et al. [80] examined the mean reaction rate of CH 4 , 
CO  and  OH  at  several  downstream  locations  of  a  turbulent  pre- 
mixed methane/air Bunsen ﬂame in the thin reaction zone regime. 
The  mean  reaction  rates,  conditioned  on  progress  variable,  were 
bounded by solutions obtained from an unstrained laminar ﬂame 
and a strained laminar ﬂame with a strain rate matching that of 
the mean tangential strain in the turbulent ﬂame. More recently, 
Savard et al. [132] examined the conditional mean reaction rates 
of  three  rich  n-dodecane/air  premixed  ﬂames  ( φ = 3 ,  5,  and  7) 
at a constant pressure of 60 atm, matching the Karlovitz number 
from the Engine Combustion Network Spray A condition. The heat 
release rate and reaction rates of n-C 12 H 26 , C 12 H 15 O 2 , CH 2 O and 
C 2 H 2  were compared against laminar ﬂame solutions using unity 
and non-unity Lewis number solutions. As shown in Fig. 23 , there 
is a broad spread of reaction rates around the corresponding lam- 
inar solutions. The mean reaction rates in progress variable space 
match more closely with the unity Lewis number laminar solutions 
than the non-unity Lewis number solutions. 

Most studies of reaction rates in highly turbulent ﬂames have 
shown that conditional means resemble those of laminar ﬂames 
at “appropriate” conditions (i.e., with a particular strain-rate and 
transport model), although a large standard deviation around the 
conditional  mean  is  always  observed.  However,  such  a  resem- 
blance may be compromised by mixing of hot radical-rich prod- 
ucts with the reactants directly, for example through the pocket 
ﬂames shown by Fig. 16 in Section 3.1 . When these pockets fail to 
ignite the surrounding fresh mixture, the enthalpy and species in 
the pocket ﬂame gradually mix with the surrounding fresh mix- 
ture. Such mixing can be highly consequential for large hydrocar- 
bons  because,  in  laminar ﬂames,  endothermic  fuel  cracking  pro- 
cesses are segregated from oxidation reactions (see Fig. 2 ). If the 
fresh reactants mix with the products without reacting, the sub- 
sequent  reaction  rates  can  be  enhanced.  This  was  demonstrated 
by Smolke et al. [148] using calculations from a series of isobaric 
and adiabatic pyrolytic reactors with initial temperatures at 1100 K, 
1200 K and 1300 K. They found that the laminar ﬂame speed and 
the extinction strain rates were increased when the reactants em-

Karlovitz numbers of 10,0 0 0 as shown in Fig. 24 . As reﬂected in 
Fig.  9 (a),  conditions  relevant  to  practical  combustors  reside  out- 
side the “distributed reactions” regime. The irrelevance of the PSR 
limit is partly due to the fact that practical devices are designed 
to  avoid  detrimental  limit  conditions.  As  observed  in  the  previ- 
ous sections, transition to extinction, autoignition and compress- 
ible regimes occur more frequently with increasing turbulence in- 
tensity. Such limit phenomena might be precursors to global ﬂame 
extinction or the onset of combustion instability [33] , which are 
undesirable in practical combustors. 

For  methane/air  ﬂames,  the  normally  co-located  fuel  con- 
sumption and heat release rates in a laminar ﬂame can become 
de-correlated  due  to  hydrodynamic  effects.  As  noted  by  Wabel 
et al. [111] , heat release rates in the LUPJ burner do not completely 
coincide  with  methane  consumption.  Their  study  post-processed 
DNS of two high Karlovitz number ﬂames to assess experimentally 
accessible heat release rate markers, accounting for experimental 
factors. They reported the existence of a spatially distributed low- 
intensity heat release zone that makes up approximately 30% of 
the total heat release rate, due to slow oxidation of CO that is con- 
vected downstream to CO 2 due to insuﬃcient residence time up- 
stream. We note that this distributed heat release region is fun- 
damentally different than that hypothesized to occur due to rapid 
turbulent stirring in the main heat release zone of a methane/air 
ﬂame. The low-intensity heat release zone cannot be detected by 
common ﬂame markers, because these markers are designed to de- 
tect key chemical reactions in the process of transitioning from hy- 
drocarbon fuels to CO, instead of CO oxidation. 

Wang et al. [65] also reported “two-stage” combustion in DNS 
of stratiﬁed ﬂames. They found that the temperature-conditioned 
mean reaction rate of the recombination reaction CO + OH = CO 2 
+ H is lower than in a laminar ﬂame in the upstream regions with 
low residence time. Further downstream, the conditional mean of 
the  reaction  rate  becomes  comparable  to,  or  higher  than,  corre- 
sponding laminar ﬂames, indicating that CO is not completely oxi- 
dized upstream and signiﬁcant CO oxidation occurs further down- 
stream. As a result of the low residence time upstream, fuel frag- 
ments  such  as  CO  and  H 2  are  not  allowed  suﬃcient  time  to  be 
converted to CO 2 or H 2 O. Consequently, they are convected down- 
stream and fully oxidized at the ﬂame tip. 

3.4. Local combustion mode and its diagnostics 

To understand the dynamics of ﬂame propagation in highly tur- 
bulent premixed ﬂames, diagnosis of the local combustion mode 
is vitally important [15,134,149,150] . Here, we aim to distinguish 
between  the  different  modes  of  premixed  combustion  described 
in  Section  2.2.1 ,  as  opposed  to  whether  local  ﬂame  segments 
are premixed, non-premixed, or partially premixed. Knowledge of 
whether a local mixture is a diffusion-enabled premixed deﬂagra- 
tion or a chemistry-driven auto-ignition front is critical for devel- 
oping  physics-based  combustion  models.  For  a  chemistry-driven 
auto-ignition front, its propagation is more sensitive to the local 
composition  and  details  of  ﬁnite-rate  chemistry,  compared  to  a 
conventional deﬂagration wave. 

3.4.1. Budget analysis 

Quantitative diagnostics of the local combustion mode are re- 
lated  to  the  balance  between  advection,  diffusion,  and  reaction, 
as  these  are  the  three  driving  processes  for  chemical  scalar  dy- 
namics. Transport budget analysis of advection, diffusion, and re- 
action has been widely adopted to differentiate various local dy- 
namics  [13,70,149,151] .  The  quantity  of  interest  in  these  studies 
is usually a scalar, such as mass fraction of a species or progress 
variable, or the scalar gradient. The analysis is conventionally con- 
ducted in physical space. For example, through transport budget

dimensional auto-ignition (red dash-dotted-dash lines), perfectly stirred reactors

ployed in these calculations were obtained from the partially “re- 
formed” products in the pyrolytic reactors. 

3.3.3. Decorrelated fuel consumption and heat release rates 

Whether the fuel decomposition rate is correlated (or decorre- 
lated) with heat release rate in the same manner as in a corre- 
sponding laminar ﬂame is a potentially useful metric for assessing 
the inﬂuence of turbulence on chemistry. As shown in Fig. 2 , the 
location of fuel consumption relative to heat release rate in lami- 
nar ﬂames depends on the fuel/air mixture. Indeed, despite being 
the most investigated fuel, methane is rather an exception in terms 
of the co-location of fuel consumption and heat release. Unsurpris- 
ingly, the enlarged thermochemical space induced by strong turbu- 
lence can alter these relationships in a fuel-dependent manner. 

Aspden et al. [69,86,131] reported an increasing de-correlation 
between fuel consumption and heat release rates with increasing 
Karlovitz numbers in H 2 /air ﬂames. They suggested that differen- 
tial diffusion of the highly mobile hydrogen atom, in conjunction 
with turbulent advection and molecular mixing, contribute to the 
observed de-correlation. 

Xu et al. [66] observed a de-correlation between fuel consump- 
tion and heat release rates for a series of DNS of n-dodecane/air 
ﬂames at 30 bar. As shown in Fig. 24 , the fuel consumption rate 
peaks  around  1500  K  and  the  heat  release  rate  peaks  around 
1900  K  at  a  relatively  modest  Karlovitz  number  of  100.  Sim- 
ilar  de-correlations  have  been  reported  in  a  few  other  heavy- 
hydrocarbon based DNS studies [67,123] , and have also been ob- 
served in corresponding unstrained laminar ﬂames (e.g., as shown 
in Fig. 2 ), as an expected consequence of fuel cracking [148] . How- 
ever, the fuel consumption peak is brought closer to the heat re- 
lease  peak  in  temperature  space  with  increasing  Karlovitz  num- 
bers (i.e., Fig. 24 (b) and (c) for Ka δ, K = 1,0 0 0 and 10,0 0 0, respec- 
tively).  That  is,  the  de-correlation  of  fuel  consumption  and  heat 
release  rates  found  in  laminar  n-dodecane/air  ﬂames  is  statisti- 
cally reduced in intense turbulence due to the rapid turbulence- 
induced mixing. Fuel consumption rates are much larger than in 
corresponding laminar ﬂames at Ka δ, K = 10,0 0 0, because the en- 
dothermic fuel cracking process is exposed to temperatures up to 
1800 K. 

Although  the  limit  of  a  perfectly  stirred  reactor  (PSR)  is  em- 
ployed  in  Fig.  24 ,  PSR-like  behaviors  are  rarely  observed  in  the 
reviewed literature, except under the extreme conditions around 

23

tions. For example, Valorani et al. [155] employed CSP to study the 
dynamic balances between chemistry, diffusion, and advection in 
a methane/air ﬂame-vortex interaction simulation. The time scales 
of the local chemistry are represented by time scales of the fast 
and slow CSP modes, and the roles of diffusion, convection, and 
chemistry are compared in each CSP mode. They found that the 
cold  reactant  zone  is  driven  by  diffusion,  where  active  chemical 
time scales are much slower than those of diffusion and convec- 
tion. In the ﬂame region, the driving time scales are those from 
chemical reactions, and the thermochemical manifold has a large 
dimension. Finally, downstream of the ﬂame, the dynamics are lo- 
cally controlled by slow transport processes and slow chemical ki- 
netics. 

In addition to understanding the ﬂame structure, an importance 
index can be deﬁned using the CSP concept to measure the relative 
importance of transport (convection and diffusion) and tempera- 
ture [14] . The importance index was applied to the regions ahead 
of  the  reaction  fronts  in  a  series  of  HCCI-type  syngas/air  ﬂames 
and successfully differentiated deﬂagration from auto-ignition. To 
further avoid the tolerance-based selection of individual chemical 
time scales, Valorani et al. [156] formulated a tangential stretching 
rate (TSR) method for reactive-diffusive systems, in which the rel- 
ative importance of transport and chemistry were compared in the 
direction of the most energy-containing mode. 

3.4.3. Chemical explosive model analysis 

Chemical explosive mode analysis (CEMA), which is closely re- 
lated  to  CSP,  provides  another  approach  to  describing  the  local 
combustion mode and has been widely adopted in the analysis of 
turbulent reactive ﬂows and other limiting phenomena in combus- 
tion, e.g., Refs. [66,158–161] .

CEMA  is  performed  through  the  eigen-decomposition  of  the

chemical Jacobian ( J ω ≡ ∂ ˙ ω /∂ ψ ), as shown by 
D ˙ ω 
D t 
Here ψ  is  comprised  of  all  species  concentrations  and  tempera- 
ture,  and  ˙ ω  and  s  are  two  vectors  containing  the  chemical  and 
non-chemical (i.e., diffusion) source terms for all components of ψ , 
respectively. A chemical mode is deﬁned as an eigenmode of the 
chemical Jacobian J ω . Each chemical mode is associated with an 
eigenvalue ( λe ) and a corresponding pair of left ( b e ) and right ( a e ) 
eigenvectors. A chemical mode is further classiﬁed as a chemical 
explosive mode (CEM) if the real part of the associated eigenvalue, 
Re (λe ) , is positive [157] . The existence of a CEM indicates that the 
reaction rates of the mixture tend to grow exponentially along the 
direction of the eigenvector associated with the CEM, if the mix- 
ture is isolated in a lossless environment where all non-chemical 
sources are negligible; the existence of a CEM indicates that the 
mixture  could  undergo  thermal  runaway.  However,  the  thermal 
runaway does not necessarily occur, particularly when other non- 
chemical effects, such as diffusion, are strong. To avoid ambiguity, 
the largest Re( λe ) generally is taken to visualize the CEMs of the 
mixture. 

Additional  procedures  have  been  developed  in  the  past  ﬁve 
years [12,66] to introduce transport effects into CEMA-based meth- 
ods.  The  objective  is  to  distinguish  different  local  combustion 
modes by measuring the contributions of diffusion ( ϕ s ) and reac- 
tion ( ϕ ω ) on the evolution of a (purley chemical) CEM. Both ϕ s and 
ϕ ω are deﬁned based on the projection of the diffusion ( s ) and re- 
action ( ˙ ω ) source terms to the left eigenvector b e associated with 
CEM, respectively, namely 
ϕ s ≡ b e · s ,  ϕ ω ≡ b e · ˙ ω .

Comparison  of  ϕ s  and  ϕ ω  systematically  quantiﬁes  the  compe- 
tition  between  molecular  diffusion  and  chemical  reactions.  Note

analysis, Krisman et al. [152] demonstrated that advection is bal- 
anced by reactions under autoignitive conditions, while diffusion 
is balanced by reactions for deﬂagration waves. 

However, this form of budget analysis can be ambiguous under 
certain  complicated  conditions  (e.g.,  turbulent  stratiﬁed  ﬂames). 
Other quantities, such as the scalar dissipation rates or tempera- 
ture gradients, need to be considered to clearly identify the mode. 
For example, Fig. 25 shows two different scenarios in a thermally 
stratiﬁed  H 2 /air  ﬂame  where  two  one-dimensional  hydrogen/air 
ﬂames  propagate  into  inhomogeneous  temperature  ﬁelds  whose 
ﬂuctuations  are  characterized  by  different  wavelength  L  [13] ;  at 
L = 4 . 1  mm  (large  wavelength  limit),  reactions  are  much  larger 
than diffusion, whereas reactions and diffusion are more balanced 
at  L = 0 . 75  mm  (small  wavelength  limit).  However,  there  is  no 
clear distinction between combustion modes and additional infor- 
mation (e.g., based on the temperature gradient in Fig. 25 (b)), is re- 
quired to more clearly identify the auto-igniting (lower gradient at 
L = 4.1 mm) and deﬂagration (higher gradient at L = 0.75 mm) fronts. 
Hence, although transport budget analysis can provide helpful in- 
sights for differentiating auto-ignition and deﬂagration fronts, its 
effectiveness is often conﬁguration-dependent, and the comparison 
between diffusion, advection and reaction sources is rather quali- 
tative. 

3.4.2. Computational singular perturbation 

A  more  quantitative  method  to  quantify  the  contributions  of 
chemistry  and  diffusion  to  scalar  evolution  employs  the  compu- 
tational singular perturbation (CSP) method [153,154] . A vector of 
modes  can  be  deﬁned  for  a  nonlinear  time-dependent  ordinary 
differential equation  (ODE)  system.  For  a  combustion  system  in- 
volving detailed chemistry, each element of the vector of modes 
is a linear combination of reaction rates for each species. The CSP 
method provides a reﬁnement procedure to decouple the fast and 
slow modes, and subsequently identiﬁes exhausted fast processes 
that can be algebraically related to other processes. It has been pri- 
marily applied in the analysis and reduction of stiff nonlinear ODE 
systems, to identify quasi-steady-state species, to eliminate unim- 
portant species, and to remove stiffness. 

For dynamic systems involving diffusion and advection, the CSP 
reﬁnement procedure is extended to treat partial differential equa- 

A.M. Steinberg, P.E. Hamlington and X. Zhao 

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 85 (2021) 10 090 0 

diffusion  moves  heat  and  radicals  away  from  the  ignition  direc- 
tion. Depending on the dynamics of the ﬂame, the local extinction 
mode may or may not lead to extinction of the chemical reactions. 
The concepts of local extinction and local auto-ignition in turbu- 
lent ﬂames are not unique to CEMA-based local mode analysis. In 
fact, local extinction/auto-ignition has been constantly delineated 
in turbulent combustion literature using scatter plots and budget 
analysis (e.g., Fig. 25 ). CEMA-based local mode analysis only offers 
a speciﬁc mathematical deﬁnition. 

An experimental approach for identifying CEMs (and heat re- 
lease  rate)  has  recently  been  proposed  [162]  and  assessed  us- 
ing DNS of the LUPJ burner [163] . Raman/Rayleigh/OH PLIF mea- 
surements  were  simulated,  providing  information  on  the  major 
species, temperature, and OH concentration. Promising agreement 
with computational predictions was shown in measuring the loca- 
tion of zero-crossing of the eigenvalues of the chemical Jacobian 
(i.e., the location of the ignition fronts) for both laminar and tur- 
bulent ﬂames. This introduces the possibility of performing CEMA 
of  local  combustion  modes  in  ﬂames  that  are  not  accessible  to 
DNS. 

3.5. Summary 

As  a  summary,  the  burning  rates  of  ﬂames  are  determined 
by  reaction  and  transport  (including  both  macroscopic  transport 
through turbulence and microscopic transport through molecular 
diffusion) of the mixture. The competition between the processes 
intensiﬁes with increasing turbulence intensity, and the resulting 
local combustion modes/states diversify in these highly turbulent 
ﬂames. A few takeaway points are summarized below: 

1. In physical space, highly turbulent premixed ﬂames can be lo- 
cally thinned or thickened. Preheat zones are shown to be reac- 
tive, enabled by pyrolysis reactions, differential diffusion, local 
extinction, and intense turbulent advection. 

2. Non-unity Lewis number effects persist in these highly turbu- 
lent  premixed ﬂames,  and  are particularly  noticeable in local 
ﬂame dynamics, such as local heat release rates [69,86] and re- 
sponses to stretch [76] , etc. Consequently, the choice of molec- 
ular transport models can have a signiﬁcant impact, at least on 
local ﬂame dynamics. 

3. Reaction rates are more varied in highly turbulent ﬂames com- 
pared  to  their  laminar  counterparts,  for  example  as  demon- 
strated  in  Refs.  [67,69,86,132] ,  due  to  the  enlarged  thermo- 
chemical state space created by turbulence-chemistry interac- 
tions. Chemical pathways remain similar between different con- 
ditions, although more reactions are consequential to a signif- 
icant level for turbulent ﬂames. Due to the optimization pro- 
cess used to develop chemical kinetic models, the task of iden- 
tifying missing chemical pathways in reduced chemical mecha- 
nisms remains challenging. 

4. Fuel consumption and heat release rates are not closely corre- 
lated in highly turbulent premixed ﬂames, as a result of fuel 
pyrolysis [66,67,123] , differential diffusion [69,86,131] , local ex- 
tinction [66] , and turbulent advection [65,111] . Caution should 
be taken when employing fuel consumption rates as a surrogate 
for heat release rate, either experimentally or computationally. 
5. For  high  Karlovitz  number  turbulent  premixed  ﬂames,  local 
ﬂame characteristics are diversiﬁed and adjusted to local tur- 
bulence and chemistry conditions. Such adjustments can man- 
ifest  in  terms  of  local  ﬂame  thickness,  ﬂame  surface  density, 
and frequency of local limit conditions, etc. Consequently, many 
state-of-the-art turbulent combustion models can still provide 
reasonable predictions of ﬂames in this regime, although prior 
knowledge of local conditions and the ability to adjust to these 
conditions are required to attain suﬃcient accuracy.

that ϕ ω is strictly positive. When ϕ s > ϕ ω , energy and radicals are 
transported  in  a  manner  that  moves  the  mixture  towards  ther- 
mal runaway, at a faster rate than chemistry drives the mixture. 
This is termed (diffusion) “assisted ignition” in the CEMA literature. 
When −ϕ ω < ϕ s < ϕ ω , chemical kinetics dominate the local scalar 
dynamics compared to transport, which is termed “auto-ignition”
in  the  literature.  Finally, ϕ s < −ϕ ω  indicates  that  heat  and  radi- 
cal loss through diffusion adjust the mixture away from ignition 
faster than the chemistry moves it towards ignition; this is termed 
“extinction”. The ratio ϕ s /ϕ ω  then indicates the local combustion 
mode. 

As an example, Fig. 26 shows CEMA of the combustion mode 
in the central plane of an upward-propagating n-dodecane/air pla- 
nar jet ﬂame at 30 atm and Ka δ, K  = 1,0 0 0 [66] . The real part of 
the eigenvalue associated with the CEM is shown in the left panel, 
where the zero-crossing (i.e., the interface between positive and 
negative, or visually between red and blue in Fig. 26 ) indicates the 
location of ignition fronts. The local combustion modes (i.e., ϕ s /ϕ ω ) 
are identiﬁed within the explosive region of the ﬂame, as shown in 
the middle panel. The two diffusion-dominant modes (i.e., “extinc- 
tion” mode and “assisted-ignition” mode) are frequently observed 
in the pre-ignition region of the turbulent ﬂame brush, indicating a 
strong inﬂuence from diffusion on the ignition propensity in these 
ﬂames. The integrated heat release rates, conditional on each lo- 
cal combustion mode and axial position, are shown in the right 
panel in Fig. 26 . All three modes contribute signiﬁcantly to the in- 
tegrated heat release rate across the broad ﬂame brush, demon- 
strating  the  intense  competition  between  diffusion  and  reaction 
throughout this highly turbulent premixed ﬂame. 

We  note  that  having  signiﬁcant  heat  release  rate  in  regions 
identiﬁed as “extinction” is not paradoxical, given the deﬁnition of 
“extinction” used in this analysis. In fact, similar confusion might 
arise when relating the local “auto-ignition” mode with the con- 
ventional concept of “auto-ignition” in a mixture. The local “auto- 
ignition  mode” and  conventional  “auto-ignition” share  common 
characteristics  in  the  sense  that  thermal  runaway  is  a  dominat- 
ing factor compared to diffusion. Similarly, the “extinction mode”
from CEMA describes a local and instantaneous condition where

4. Turbulence structure and dynamics 

The discussion in Section 3 focused on the impact of turbulence 
on ﬂame structure and dynamics, primarily through the modiﬁca- 
tion of scalar gradients controlling diffusion and, consequently, the 
complexity of the thermochemical state space and reaction rates. 
However, chemical reactions also inﬂuence the turbulent ﬂow, both 
by altering ﬂuid transport properties and by coupling thermal and 
mechanical energies. This section reviews current knowledge re- 
garding  the  impact  of  combustion  on  turbulence  structure  and 
dynamics  in  highly  turbulent  premixed  ﬂames.  In  the  following, 
we outline both kinematic and dynamic properties of turbulence. 
Kinematic  properties  pertain  to  how  the  ﬂow  is  structured  and 
moves, including both single and multi-point statistics of velocity 
(e.g., turbulence kinetic energy) and velocity gradient (e.g., vortic- 
ity and strain rate) quantities. Spectra and scale-dependent turbu- 
lence characteristics can also be considered kinematic properties. 
The  dynamics  of  turbulence  provide  an  explanation  for  why  the 
ﬂow behaves as it does, in particular revealing the physical mech- 
anisms by which the ﬂame affects the turbulent ﬂow. For exam- 
ple, dynamics encompasses the study of terms found in the turbu- 
lence kinetic energy transport equation, in either physical or spec- 
tral space, as well as the study of the coupled evolution of the vor- 
ticity and strain rate, including alignments between the vorticity 
and strain rate eigenvectors. We also discuss the status and out- 
look for universal theories of turbulence during highly turbulent 
premixed combustion, with a particular focus on the applicability 
of classical theories developed for non-reacting turbulence. 

It should be noted that we focus here speciﬁcally on the proper- 
ties of turbulence for highly turbulent premixed combustion. It has 
been established that there are substantial effects of the ﬂame on 
turbulence at lower intensities, and an exhaustive review of knowl- 
edge in this area has been provided by Lipatnikov & Chomiak [9] . 
By contrast, we are just now beginning to understand the prop- 
erties of turbulence at high intensities, and how these properties 
vary as the turbulence intensity (or Karlovitz number) increases. 
It should also be noted that, in the following discussion, we de- 
vote  substantial  attention  to  the  properties  of  non-reacting  (i.e., 
constant density and constant viscosity) turbulence. It will be seen 
from this review that properties of non-reacting turbulence are of 
more than simply academic interest since, in many respects, the 
characteristics of turbulence for highly turbulent combustion are 
similar to those found in non-reacting ﬂows. 

4.1. Turbulence kinetic energy, stresses, and ﬂuxes 

For any high- Re (cid:2) turbulent ﬂow, there is substantial spatial and 
temporal  complexity,  and  ﬂuid  mixing  is  enhanced  compared  to 
laminar  ﬂows.  This  complexity  can  be  quantiﬁed  using  second- 
order, single-point statistics, including the turbulence kinetic en- 
ergy,  turbulent  stresses,  and  turbulent  ﬂuxes  of  various  scalar 
quantities, such as the temperature and reactant mass fraction. In 
the following, we summarize the current understanding of these 
statistics in highly turbulent premixed reacting ﬂows. It should be 
noted that these quantities, including their dynamics, are also fre- 
quently  studied  using  multi-scale  and  spectral  analyses;  we  will 
discuss these characteristics in Section 4.3 . 

4.1.1. Turbulence kinetic energy 

The  intensity  of  turbulence  is  often  quantiﬁed  using  the  tur- 
, where u (cid:3) 
i u (cid:3) 
bulence kinetic energy k ≡ (1 / 2) u (cid:3) 
i and (·) is 
i 
an  appropriately  deﬁned  average  (e.g.,  an  ensemble  average).  In 
many studies of premixed combustion, the ensemble averaged k 
is replaced instead by the Favre-averaged deﬁnition of turbulence 
kinetic energy, (cid:13) k ≡ (1 / 2) (cid:2) 
i  and  (cid:13) ψ = ρψ / ρ
, where u (cid:3)(cid:3) 
i u (cid:3)(cid:3) 
u (cid:3)(cid:3) 
i 
denotes a Favre-average of a generic variable ψ . Favre averages are 

i  = u

i − u 

often used to simplify the analysis of governing equations in com- 
pressible and reacting ﬂows, due to the considerable temporal and 
spatial variations in density found in such ﬂows. In some cases, the 
turbulence intensity is quantiﬁed using a single component of u (cid:3)(cid:3) 
i , 
for example the root mean square intensity (cid:3)

The transport equation for (cid:13) k is obtained from the trace of the

The  ﬁrst  term  on  the  right-hand  side  represents  kinetic  energy 
production by Favre-averaged velocity gradients, the second term 
represents  the  velocity-pressure  gradient  interaction,  the  third 
term represents viscous and turbulent transport, and the last term 
represents viscous dissipation. Although the production and dissi- 
pation terms are roughly equal in magnitude across a wide range 
of ﬂows, the balance of the various terms Eq. (22) can nevertheless 
vary  substantially,  particularly  in  premixed  reacting  ﬂows  where 
the velocity-pressure gradient term can be signiﬁcant. This term 
can be rewritten as

where the second term on the right-hand side represents pressure- 
dilatation  effects,  which  are  present  only  in  compressible  ﬂows 
where  ∂ u (cid:3)(cid:3)

k (cid:11) = 0 .  The  ﬁrst  term  on  the  right  in  Eq.  (23)  is 
k 
present even in incompressible non-reacting ﬂows and represents 
pressure transport; this term is often combined with the viscous 
and turbulent transport terms in Eq. (22) . 

A number of studies have examined the properties of the tur- 
bulence  kinetic  energy  during  premixed  combustion  spanning  a 
wide  range  of  turbulence  intensities,  including  conditions  char- 
acterized by high Ka δ, K . Using DNS of statistically planar ﬂames, 
Chakraborty et al. [166] and Wang & Abraham [165] showed that 
(cid:13) k  decreases  monotonically  across  the  ﬂame  brush  at  high  Ka δ, K , 
where Ka δ, K = 0 . 54 and 13 in Ref. [166] and 1.1–49 in Ref. [165] . 
For example, Fig. 27 shows the decrease in (cid:13) k as a function of the 
planar averaged progress variable [165] . This decrease was found 
by both Chakraborty et al. [166] and Wang & Abraham [165] to 
be due to the dominance of viscous dissipation and viscous trans- 
port as the kinematic viscosity increases across the ﬂame. Wang & 
Abraham [165] used a scaling analysis to further show that both 
viscous transport and dissipation vary as the square of Ka δ, K , with 
the production and pressure-dilatation terms having weaker scal- 
ings with Ka δ, K . For lower values of Ka δ, K , pressure-velocity cou- 
pling  terms,  including  the  pressure-dilatation,  were  found  to  be 
more  signiﬁcant  in  the  overall  dynamics,  but  the  magnitudes  of 
these terms weakened relative to the production and dissipation 
terms  as  Ka δ, K  increased.  It  is  important  to  note,  however,  that 
there  is  no  mean  shear  in  these  statistically  planar  ﬂames  that 
would lead to the production of turbulence kinetic energy via the 
ﬁrst term on the right side of Eq. (22) . These results are also sta- 
tistical, and it is still possible to have locally and instantaneously 
large values of the pressure-dilatation, even if the average effect is 
small. 

Mean  shear  is  present  in  jet  ﬂames,  for  example  the  pla- 
nar  premixed  hydrogen-air  jet  studied  using  DNS  by  MacArt 
et al. [164,167] and Lee et al. [168] . In these jet conﬁgurations, the 
stress components (cid:3) 
αu (cid:3)(cid:3) 
u (cid:3)(cid:3) 
α (summation over repeated Greek indices 
is not implied) were each shown to decrease across the ﬂame as a 
whole, consistent with results for the planar conﬁguration studied

by Wang & Abraham [165] . However, there also was an increase in 
(cid:3) 
α and, hence, (cid:13) k for intermediate values of the Favre-averaged 
αu (cid:3)(cid:3) 
u (cid:3)(cid:3) 
progress variable (cid:13) c (see Fig. 28 ). This increase, which was present 
for both low and high values of Ka δ, K (corresponding to in-ﬂame 
Karlovitz numbers of 3.7 and 54, respectively), had different dy- 
namical origins in each case, as shown in Fig. 29 [164] . In partic- 
ular, for low Ka δ, K , each term in the transport equation for (cid:13) k was 
substantially non-zero, except for the turbulence and viscous trans- 
port terms, and the velocity-pressure gradient term was found to 
be dominant in the overall dynamics. However, for high Ka δ, K , the 
velocity-pressure gradient term was found to be negligible, with 
the dominant balance occurring between the production and vis- 
cous dissipation terms. This is the same balance observed in many 
non-reacting jet ﬂows, where the mean shear results in large ki- 
netic energy production that is primarily balanced by dissipation. 

Consistent  with  the  premixed  jet  cases  examined  by  MacArt 
et  al.  [164,167]  and  Lee  et  al.  [168] ,  the  DNS  study  of  a  strat- 
iﬁed  premixed  methane-air  jet  ﬂame  by  Wang  et  al.  [65]  also 
shows  that  the  turbulent  velocity  u (cid:3)  is  largest  for  intermediate 
values  of  the  Favre-averaged  progress  variable (cid:13) c ,  with  the  peak 
shifting  to  larger  values  of (cid:13) c  with  greater  downstream  distance 
(see  Fig.  30 ).  At  all  downstream  locations,  the  ﬁnal  value  of  u (cid:3) 
for (cid:13) c → 1 is smaller than the initial value for (cid:13) c → 0 , and this dis- 
parity increases in magnitude with greater downstream distance. 
Although  kinetic  energy  transport  terms  were  not  explicitly  cal- 
culated  in  this  study,  it  can  again  be  inferred  based  on  the  re- 
sults from MacArt et al. [164] that the increase in turbulence in- 
tensity for intermediate values of (cid:13) c corresponds to a dominance 
of shear-inﬂuenced production for intermediate values. It should 
be noted that Galeazzo et al. [169] show radial proﬁles of the ax- 
ial velocity variance, which is connected to the turbulence kinetic 
energy,  for  the  same  high  Ka δ, K  stratiﬁed  premixed  jet  ﬂame  as 
that studied by Wang et al. [65] . The variance in this study peaks 
off the centerline of the jet, and results from LES with tabulated 
ﬂamelets are shown to agree closely with corresponding DNS re- 
sults for the same ﬂow [65] . A similar peak in the variance was 
also observed experimentally by Coriton et al. [170] for a partially 
premixed dimethyl ether/air jet ﬂame. 

Taken together, these studies indicate that the turbulence in- 
tensity, reﬂected in the value of the turbulence kinetic energy, (cid:13) k , 
generally decreases across premixed planar and jet ﬂames at high

Ka δ, K conditions, due primarily to the increase in viscous dissipa- 
tion resulting from heat release and the corresponding increase in 
viscosity. In ﬂows with strong mean shear, such as jets, dissipation 
is balanced primarily by production due to mean velocity gradi- 
ents. A similar importance of mean shear has been observed for 
the propagation of ﬂames in channels [171] and boundary layers 
[172] . Although velocity-pressure gradient effects can be dominant 
for  low  Ka δ, K ,  this  effect  contributes  increasingly  weakly  to  the 
overall dynamics, as compared to production and dissipation, with 
increasing Ka δ, K . As such, the dynamics of the turbulence kinetic 
energy increasingly approach that of a corresponding non-reacting 
ﬂow as Ka δ, K increases, although locally and instantaneously large 
magnitudes of heat release effects such as the pressure-dilatation 
correlation may still be present. This is particularly true for higher 
turbulence intensities where the internal intermittency (discussed 
more in subsequent sections) is greater, leading to potentially large 
values of gradient quantities relative to their means. 

In contrast to these results for premixed planar and jet ﬂames, 
in highly turbulent Bunsen ﬂames relatively little change has been 
observed in the turbulence kinetic energy across the ﬂame. In par- 
ticular, despite the tendency for the turbulence kinetic energy to 
generally decrease across premixed planar and jet ﬂames, Wabel 
et al. [173] did not observe a decrease in the turbulence kinetic 
energy across the preheat layer of a highly turbulent premixed pi-

loted  Bunsen  ﬂame  (see  Fig.  31 ).  This  difference  may  be  due  to 
the higher free-stream turbulence levels in this case, although an 
increase in the integral scale was observed through the ﬂame, sug- 
gesting that energy was shifted to larger scales, even if the overall 
kinetic energy was largely unaffected. 

There is also evidence for a dependence on the fuel type in the 
kinetic energy dynamics. In particular, Paxton et al. [174] examined 
fuel effects on the turbulence kinetic energy and shear stress for 
premixed jet ﬂames at high intensities, ﬁnding that these quanti- 
ties decrease more rapidly along the jet centerline for methane-air 
mixtures than for mixtures with larger hydrocarbon fuels. More- 
over, the fuel dependence was found to become more pronounced 
as the Reynolds number increased. This study additionally showed 
that the effects of heat release can be partially accounted for in the 
scaling  of  the  shear  layer  thickness  when  using  a  density-based 
momentum diameter, and that there is a fuel dependence of the 
shear layer structure. The underlying physical reasons for this fuel 
dependence, including the role played by changes in the diffusive 
transport of chemical species for different fuels, remains an impor- 
tant area for further research. 

Finally,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  comparison  of  ensemble- 
and Favre-averaged quantities in Fig. 28 from Lee et al. [168] in-

dicates  that  the  difference  between  these  two  types  of  averages 
becomes less pronounced as Ka δ, K increases. Thus, not only are the 
kinetic energy dynamics increasingly similar to non-reacting ﬂows 
as Ka δ, K increases, but density weighting also becomes less signiﬁ- 
cant such that (cid:2)

4.1.2. Turbulent stresses 

The turbulent transport, or “ﬂux”, of a generic quantity ψ can 
be quantiﬁed using the single-point, second-order statistic u (cid:3) 
ψ (cid:3) (in 
i 
terms of an ensemble or other appropriately deﬁned average) or as 
ψ (cid:3)(cid:3) (in terms of a Favre average). For example,  (cid:2) 
(cid:3) 
u (cid:3)(cid:3) 
i u (cid:3)(cid:3) 
u (cid:3)(cid:3) 
j  are turbu- 
i 
lent ﬂuxes of velocity u 
j in the i th direction (this quantity is often 
referred to as the “turbulent stress”), and (cid:2) 
i Y (cid:3)(cid:3) 
u (cid:3)(cid:3) 
β are turbulent ﬂuxes 
in the i th direction of the Y β mass fraction. These ﬂuxes also ap- 
pear as unclosed terms in the ensemble- or Favre-averaged gov- 
erning equations for reacting ﬂows. For example, from the Navier- 
Stokes equation in Eq.  (2) , the transport equation for the Favre- 
averaged velocity (cid:13) u

where the last term on the right-hand side is the unclosed turbu- 
lent stress. A similar unclosed term appears in the transport equa- 
tion for (cid:13) Y 
j . 

Given  the  physical  and  modeling  importance  of  turbulent 
stresses,  substantial  focus  has  been  placed  on  quantifying  their 
properties in different ﬂows. Fig. 28 shows four components of the 
stress tensor  (cid:2) 
i u (cid:3)(cid:3) 
u (cid:3)(cid:3) 
j  for a premixed methane-air jet ﬂame for both 
low and high Ka δ, K [164,168] . As noted in the previous section, the 
on-diagonal  components  of  this  tensor  increase  for  intermediate 
values of (cid:13) c and decrease overall across the ﬂame, but Fig. 28 fur- 
ther  shows  that  the  shear  stress  component  (cid:2) 
1 u (cid:3)(cid:3) 
u (cid:3)(cid:3) 
2  changes  sign 
from being predominantly negative for low Ka δ, K to predominantly 
positive for high Ka δ, K . Lee et al. [168] show that this change is due 
to differences in the velocity-pressure gradient effect through the 
ﬂame. In particular, by decomposing this term into contributions 
from the ﬂuctuating and mean pressure, Lee et al. [168] show that 
the ﬂuctuating pressure component dominates at high Ka δ, K  and 
acts to isotropize the turbulence, whereas the mean pressure com- 
ponent dominates for low Ka δ, K  where dilatation by the ﬂame is 
signiﬁcant relative to turbulence-induced ﬂuctuations in the ﬂow. 
There are two primary implications of this result. The ﬁrst is 
that the turbulence is expected to be more anisotropic due to ef- 
fects from the ﬂame at low Ka δ, K . This is a result that has been 
demonstrated in a number of reacting ﬂow studies using a vari- 
ety of metrics. In Section 4.2 we will comment on the generation 
of turbulence anisotropy in the context of vorticity characteristics, 
and a similar increase in the anisotropy within the ﬂame was ﬁrst 
observed for a premixed Bunsen ﬂame by Steinberg et al. [175] . 
More  recently,  MacArt  et  al.  [164]  have  shown  using  the  Favre- 
i j = (cid:2) 
/ (cid:13) k − 2 δ
i u (cid:3)(cid:3) 
u (cid:3)(cid:3) 
averaged  anisotropy  tensor  (cid:13) a 
i j / 3  that  the  turbu- 
j 
lent stress tensor is anisotropic. Through an analysis of barycentric 
maps of (cid:13) a 
i j , MacArt et al. [164] show that turbulence is anisotropic 
within the ﬂame for both low and high Ka δ, K , but after the ﬂame, 
only  the  high  Ka δ, K  case  returns  to  an  isotropic  state.  The  ten- 
dency towards isotropy for high Ka δ, K noted by MacArt et al. [164] , 
was also demonstrated from an analysis of small-scale (i.e., SFS) 
stresses by Klein et al. [176] for a statistically planar hydrogen-air 
premixed ﬂame. For lower Ka δ, K , increased anisotropy was again 
observed, which was once more attributed to the effects of dilata- 
tion by the ﬂame. 

The second primary implication of the change in stress behav- 
ior between low and high Ka δ, K conditions is related to the appli- 
cability  of  the  Boussinesq,  or  gradient  transport,  hypothesis that 

29 

ψ (cid:3)(cid:3) ∝ −∂ (cid:13) ψ /∂x 
u (cid:3)(cid:3) 
i 

is  the  basis  of  many  closure  models  for  LES  and  RANS  simula- 
tions.  In  the  context  of  Favre-averaged  quantities,  this  hypothe- 
sis states that (cid:3) 
i . That is, the turbulent ﬂux of an 
arbitrary quantity ψ in the i th direction occurs along the direc- 
tion of decreasing  (cid:13) ψ (given by the gradient). Through an examina- 
tion of the alignments of velocity (i.e., turbulent stress) and scalar 
ﬂuxes,  MacArt  et  al.  [164]  showed  that,  at  high  Ka δ, K ,  the  gra- 
dient transport hypothesis is approximately valid (or, at least, no 
less valid than in a corresponding non-reacting turbulent jet ﬂow). 
Conversely, for low Ka δ, K , the turbulent scalar ﬂux and turbulent 
stresses are substantially misaligned with the mean gradients, in- 
dicating counter-gradient transport and invalidating the Boussinesq 
hypothesis. This is reﬂected in conditional statistics of the turbu- 
lent shear stress, which reverses sign between the low and high 
Ka δ, K cases [164,167,168] (see also Fig. 28 ). 

It is emphasized that, although the Boussinesq hypothesis is ap- 
proximately valid in premixed jet ﬂames at high Ka δ, K , it should 
not be assumed that this hypothesis is valid across all high Ka δ, K 
premixed reacting ﬂows. The more appropriate understanding of 
this result is that the Boussinesq hypothesis becomes as valid in 
these high Ka δ, K  ﬂows as it is in the corresponding non-reacting 
ﬂows.  However,  there  are  many  non-reacting  ﬂows  (e.g.,  rapidly 
strained ﬂows or ﬂows with high geometric curvatures) that also 
do  not  conform  to  the  Boussinesq  hypothesis  [177] .  It  is  un- 
likely that the addition of reactions to such ﬂows would improve 
this agreement, particularly given the reduced applicability of the 
Boussinesq hypothesis observed in low Ka δ, K premixed jet ﬂames. 

4.1.3. Turbulent scalar ﬂuxes 

As noted previously, the turbulent ﬂux of a scalar quantity ψ , 
ψ (cid:3) or (cid:3) 
written as either u (cid:3) 
u (cid:3)(cid:3) 
ψ (cid:3)(cid:3) for ensemble and Favre averages, 
i 
i 
respectively, provides a quantitative measure of the strength of tur- 
bulent transport of ψ in the i th direction. In studies of turbulent 
premixed combustion across a range of turbulence intensities, it 
has been common, in particular, to study the turbulent transport of 
species mass fractions, Y β , and the combustion progress variable, c. 
In addition to providing fundamental insights into the strength and 
direction of turbulent mixing, these ﬂuxes also appear as unclosed 
terms in scalar model equations for RANS and LES (in the latter 
case, the average used to compute the scalar ﬂuxes is replaced by 
an appropriate low-pass ﬁlter). 

Due to their relevance to both RANS and LES, much of the re- 
search on scalar ﬂuxes for highly turbulent conditions has, to date, 
focused primarily on the appropriate way in which to model these 
quantities, with a particular emphasis on determining the validity 
of the gradient transport, or Boussinesq, hypothesis for different 
ﬂows and conditions. In general, the gradient transport hypothesis 
has been found to provide poor predictions for scalar ﬂuxes in pre- 
mixed ﬂames at low Ka δ, K (see, e.g., Refs. [178,179] ), but the agree- 
ment improves as Ka δ, K increases. Klein et al. [176] examined SFS 
scalar ﬂuxes (for species mass fraction scalars) in statistically pla- 
nar hydrogen-air premixed ﬂames across a range of both low and 
high Ka δ, K  (spanning Karlovitz numbers from 0.75 to 126), ﬁnd- 
ing counter-gradient transport across all Ka δ, K , although the cor- 
respondence with the gradient transport hypothesis increased as 
Ka δ, K  increased.  It  should  be  noted  that  Ranjan  et  al.  [179]  ob- 
served substantial counter-gradient transport even at high initial 
Ka δ, K , although for a statistically planar premixed ﬂame interacting 
with decaying isotropic turbulence, where the local Ka δ, K decreases 
in time as the turbulence decays. 

MacArt et al. [164] showed that conditionally averaged cross- 
stream ﬂuxes of the water mass fraction were generally positive 
for low Ka δ, K and negative for high Ka δ, K , with the former corre- 
sponding to counter-gradient transport. Through an analysis of the 
transport equation for the ﬂux (cid:2) 
i Y (cid:3)(cid:3) 
u (cid:3)(cid:3) 
β , it was shown that this change 

A.M. Steinberg, P.E. Hamlington and X. Zhao 

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 85 (2021) 10 090 0 

in behavior was due to the changing behavior of the mean scalar 
gradient and mean velocity gradient production terms as Ka δ, K in- 
creased. MacArt et al. [164] additionally examined the variance of 
(cid:2) 
Y (cid:3)(cid:3) 2 
the scalar mass fraction, observing that the dynamics of 
2 O are 
H 
dominated by heat release from the ﬂame at low Ka δ, K , while the 
primary balance is between the production by the mean scalar gra- 
dient and dissipation at high Ka δ, K , in correspondence with non- 
reacting scalar variance dynamics. 

Ultimately, although the properties of turbulent scalar ﬂuxes do, 
in general, approach those of non-reacting passive scalar ﬂuxes as 
Ka δ, K  increases, the gradient transport hypothesis remains of du- 
bious validity at high Ka δ, K  and across all regions of a premixed 
ﬂame. As such, further study of the dynamics of these ﬂuxes, such 
as that performed by MacArt et al. [164] , remains an important di- 
rection of research, particularly across different ﬂows and spanning 
a wider range of conditions. The improved understanding resulting 
from such studies may result in the more widespread use in RANS 
and LES approaches of differential second-order moment closures 
that do not rely on algebraic gradient transport hypotheses. 

4.2. Vorticity, strain rate, and scalar gradients 

Velocity gradient quantities, and the vorticity and strain rate in 
particular, have received substantial focus in studies of both react- 
ing and non-reacting turbulent ﬂows. There are many reasons for 
this focus, including: 

1. Due to the linear wavenumber weighting associated with gradi- 
ents in spectral space, velocity gradient quantities more directly 
represent small-scale properties than velocities alone; 

2. In  many  ﬂows,  vorticity  and  strain  rate  magnitude  ﬁelds  are 
punctuated by coherent and spatially localized structures (e.g., 
vortex  “tubes” and  “sheets”)  that  provide  potential  building 
blocks of turbulence; 

3. Statistics, and PDFs in particular, of the vorticity and strain rate 
reveal the internal intermittency associated with high Reynolds 
number turbulent ﬂows; 

4. The  formation  of  small-scale  ﬂuid  motions  by  nonlinear  pro- 
cesses can be directly examined, in isolation from purely con- 
vective  changes,  through  the  vortex  stretching  term  that  ap- 
pears in the vorticity transport equation; 

5. The effects of chemical heat release on turbulence can be di- 
rectly  studied  by  examining  dilatation  and  baroclinic  torque 
terms in the vorticity transport equation; 

6. The vorticity and strain rate have direct impacts on the dynam- 
ics of scalar gradients, which is particularly signiﬁcant in react- 
ing ﬂows due to the connection between scalar gradients and 
ﬂame structure (as was also discussed in Section 3 ). 

Although each of these reasons provide motivation for the study 
of velocity gradients in premixed reacting ﬂows, the last reason, in 
particular, allows the explicit study of interactions between turbu- 
lence and ﬂame structure in highly turbulent premixed combus- 
tion. The local scalar gradient χ
i  can be used to express a local 
i /χ , where χ is the scalar gra- 
i = χ
ﬂame normal direction as n 
dient magnitude, and the local ﬂame width, δt  can be expressed 
in terms of χ using Eq. (19) . Given this connection between vor- 
ticity, strain rate, and scalar gradients, we begin this section with 
a discussion of the properties and dynamics of scalar gradients in 
highly turbulent premixed ﬂames. 

4.2.1. Scalar gradients 

The gradients of thermochemical scalars are important for un- 
derstanding the local, instantaneous structure of premixed ﬂames, 
the inﬂuence of turbulence on the ﬂame structure and dynamics, 

30 

and  the  origins  of  thermochemical  complexity  under  highly  tur- 
bulent conditions. Thermochemical scalar gradients are also fun- 
damental to understanding the scalar dissipation rate, which must 
be modeled in many RANS and LES approaches to simulating pre- 
mixed combustion. These gradients have consequently been exten- 
sively studied over a range of premixed ﬂame conditions, including 
high turbulence intensities. 
The orientation of n 

i in highly turbulent premixed combustion 
has  been  explored  in  several  studies,  including  those  by  Kim  & 
Pitsch [180] , Chakraborty et al. [181–183] , Hartung et al. [184] , and 
Hamlington et al. [128] . However, most such studies have focused 
i with respect to the eigenvectors 
primarily on the orientation of n 
i j , and relatively few have 
of the ﬂuid dynamic strain rate tensor, S 
examined distributions of n 
i or their connection to wrinkling. The 
alignments of n 
i with the strain rate eigenvectors, as well as their 
physical signiﬁcance, will be discussed in more detail below, but 
it is worth noting that distributions of observed orientations of n 
i 
have been found to become more broad as the turbulence intensity 
increases [128] . For premixed ﬂames in the presence of isotropic 
turbulence,  in  particular,  the  ﬂame  orientation  becomes  increas- 
ingly isotropic as the intensity increases [128] , indicating that the 
ﬂame increasingly reﬂects properties of the underlying turbulence. 
The  characteristics  of  δt  have  also  been  explored  in  a  num- 
ber  of  studies  of  highly  turbulent  premixed  combustion.  Kamal 
et al. [185] examined the scalar dissipation rate, which is related 
to  the  inverse  of  δt ,  in  swirling  bluff body  stabilized  premixed 
ﬂames over a range of turbulence intensities, including high inten- 
sities. It was found that diffusive scalar structures become more 
broadly distributed as the turbulence intensity increases. This re- 
sults, in particular, in higher probabilities of thin diffusive regions 
at low turbulence intensity, and broader distributions of diffusive 
widths  at  higher  turbulence  intensity;  this  range  of  widths  was 
also discussed in Section 3.1 . Similarly, Kamal et al. [186] exam- 
ined temperature gradients and associated scalar dissipation rates 
in bluff-body stabilized stratiﬁed turbulent premixed methane-air 
ﬂames, ﬁnding that gradients were reduced compared to the cor- 
responding laminar ﬂow, indicating a thickening of the ﬂame (i.e., 
an increase in δt ) compared to corresponding laminar strained and 
unstrained  ﬂames).  Magnotti  &  Barlow  [187]  examined  progress 
variable gradients and dissipation rates in a high-shear premixed 
methane-air  bluff-body  stabilized  ﬂame,  revealing  a  decrease  in 
gradient  magnitudes  through  the  ﬂame  and  a  corresponding  in- 
crease in the ﬂame thickness. For a fuel-lean ﬂame this broadening 
was observed in the preheat zone only, but for a fuel rich ﬂame the 
broadening was observed in both the preheat and reaction zones. 
Numerical  studies  have  largely  conﬁrmed  these  experimental 
results. Kim & Pitsch [180] , Sankaran et al. [80,188] , Chakraborty 
et  al.  [189] ,  and  Hamlington  et  al.  [128]  all  found  that  δt  was 
greater than the corresponding local laminar ﬂame width in the 
preheat  zone  of  premixed  ﬂames,  as  compared  to  the  reaction 
zone, and that these values increased in all regions of the ﬂame as 
the turbulence intensity increased. This is indicative of local ﬂame 
broadening by turbulence, although the continued correspondence 
between the turbulent and laminar reaction zone widths, even for 
high turbulence intensities, was unexpected. This resilience of the 
reaction zone to strong turbulence has been explained [128,182] by 
the reduction of vorticity and strain rate magnitudes by dilatation 
and the increase in viscous dissipation associated with heat release 
by the ﬂame, as will be demonstrated in more detail in the next 
section. Distributions of the local ﬂame width were also examined 
by Chaudhuri et al. [129] and Hamlington et al. [190] , showing that 
a wide range of ﬂame widths, both thinner and broader than the 
corresponding laminar ﬂame, are found in highly turbulent condi- 
tions (see also Fig. 14 ). 
The dynamics of n 

i and δt are fundamentally governed by the 
i , which evolves according to the transport equation

Prior studies of scalar gradient dynamics have shown that the 
dominant effects of turbulence on δt and χ are represented by the 
strain rate interaction terms found on the right-hand sides of Eqs. 
(26) and (28) [80,128,182,183,188] . In order to understand the sign 
and magnitude of this term for different conditions, it has been 
common to rewrite it in terms of the magnitude, eigenvalues, and 
i j as 
eigenvectors of the strain rate S

where S = (S

values  of  S 
i  are  the  corresponding 
eigenvectors. For λ1 > 0 and λ3 < 0 , the most negative and posi- 
tive eigenvalues are often referred to as the “compressional” and 
“extensional” eigenvalues,  respectively.  One  effect  of  strain  on  a 
ﬂame is to increase δt when n 
i is more closely aligned with e 1 , and 
to decrease δt when n 
i is more closely aligned with e 3 . That is, the 
sign of this turbulence interaction term is completely determined 
by the relative magnitudes of the eigenvalues and the alignments 
of the local ﬂame normal orientation with the strain rate eigenvec- 
tors. 

In  non-reacting  turbulent  ﬂows  where  ψ is  a  passive  scalar, 
the  dominant  alignment  is  between  n  and  e 3  [191–193] ,  which 
would correspond to an increase in scalar gradient magnitude χ

via Eq. (25) and to a decrease in the ﬂame width δt due to the ef- 
fects of ﬂuid straining. By contrast, in non-premixed reacting ﬂows, 
Boratav et al. [193,194] found preferential alignment between the 
scalar gradient and most extensional strain rate eigenvector e 1 , in- 
dicating the destruction of the scalar gradient magnitude. 

A  number  of  studies  of  lower  Ka δ, K  ﬂows  (outside  of  the 
highly turbulent regime that is the focus here, e.g., Refs. [184,195] ) 
have  shown  that  there  is  preferential  alignment  between  the 
scalar  gradient  and  e 1  in  premixed  reacting  ﬂows,  contrary  to 
results  found  in  non-reacting  turbulence.  However,  Chakraborty 
et al. [181] found that, in low Da (cid:2),δ statistically planar premixed 
ﬂames  (corresponding  to  Ka δ, K = 11 )  the  scalar  gradient  is  dom- 
inantly  aligned  with  e 3 .  This,  in  turn,  indicates  production  of 
the  scalar  gradient  magnitude  and  local  thinning  of  the  ﬂame 
at  these  conditions.  Consistent  with  prior  studies,  Chakraborty 
et al. [181] also found that, in high Da (cid:2),δ ﬂames (with Ka δ, K = 0 . 3 ), 
the scalar gradient is aligned with e 1 , indicating reduction of the 
gradient magnitude and local ﬂame broadening. It was noted, how- 
ever, that even for the low Da (cid:2),δ premixed ﬂame, signiﬁcant re- 
gions of alignment with e 1 were observed in regions with high lo- 
cal heat release. 

Comparing with the high Da (cid:2),δ results of Swaminathan & Grout 
[195] , which showed preferential alignment between e 1 and scalar 
gradient,  Kim  &  Pitsch  [180]  similarly  noted  that  the  alignment 
with e 3 increases as Ka δ, K increases, although this alignment weak- 
ens  for  intermediate  values  of  the  progress  variable  within  the 
ﬂame  brush  (see  Fig.  32 ).  These  trends  were  further  conﬁrmed 
through a series of simulations with increasing Ka δ, K by Hamling- 
ton et al. [128] , where it was shown that there is increasingly dom- 
inant alignment between n 
i and e 3 as Ka δ, K increases from 3.9 to 
174. 

Several  studies  have  further  examined  the  variation  in  align- 
ments between the scalar gradient and strain rate eigenvectors at 
different locations within highly turbulent premixed ﬂames. This 
is  typically  accomplished  using  conditional  statistics  based  on  a 
local progress variable value. Both Kim & Pitsch [180] and Ham- 
lington et al. [128] found that, over a range of different intensities, 
the alignment of n with e 1  was most pronounced near locations 
of dominant heat release, approximately corresponding to the re- 
action zone. For both smaller and larger progress variable values, 
by contrast, preferential alignment was observed with e 3 . 

Supporting the conclusions from these earlier numerical stud- 
ies, Coriton & Frank [196] experimentally examined the effects of 
heat release on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of S 
i j  for a pre- 
mixed methane-air Bunsen ﬂame. The ﬂame normal was found to 
preferentially align with e 1  close to the products, whereas align- 
ment with e 3  was observed in the preheat zone (see Fig. 33 ). In 
examining a high-intensity counter-ﬂow premixed ﬂame, Hampp 
& Lindstedt [197] similarly observed preferential alignment of the 
ﬂame front normal with e 1 , as well as reduced vorticity magni- 
tude  for  larger  Da.  These  results  are,  correspondingly,  consistent 
with a change in sign of the interaction term n 
j  through the 
ﬂame  for  suﬃciently  weak  turbulence  intensities;  when  Ka δ, K  is 
large enough (e.g., over 100), this term was found to be negative 
for all locations in a statistically planar premixed ﬂame, on aver- 
age, indicating a reduction in δt [128] .

It should be noted, however, that these results obtained for sta- 
tistically  planar  and  jet  premixed  ﬂames  are  not  universal,  and 
variations have been observed, particularly at low turbulence in- 
tensities. For example, Steinberg et al. [175] experimentally exam- 
ined the alignment of the ﬂame normal with the strain rate eigen- 
vectors in a premixed methane-air slot Bunsen burner at low tur- 
bulence  intensities.  It  was  found  that  the  ﬂame  normal  and  e 1 
were  predominantly  misaligned,  and  that  this  mis-alignment  in- 
creased as turbulence structures approached the ﬂame. Similarly, 
Zhou & Frank [198] experimentally examined the effects of heat re-

and n , although this alignment was not found to be dominant for 
this conﬁguration. 

With  respect  to  other  factors  affecting  scalar  gradient  align- 
ment,  Kim  &  Pitsch  [180]  examined  the  effects  of  ﬂame  curva- 
ture  on  alignment  between  the  scalar  gradient  and  strain  rate 
eigenvectors, ﬁnding that larger negative curvatures were associ- 
ated with increased alignment between the scalar gradient and e 1 . 
In general, alignment between the scalar gradient and e 1 was at- 
tributed to the importance of dilatation effects on the scalar dy- 
namics. Chakraborty et al. [182,183] also examined the effects of 
Lewis  number  (Le)  and  ﬂow  curvature  on  scalar  gradient  align- 
ment. In Ref. [182] , it was found for a range of high Ka δ, K premixed 
ﬂames (spanning roughly Ka δ, K = 10 − 34 ) that the alignment be- 
tween the scalar gradient and e 1 increases as Le decreases, indicat- 
ing increased prevalence of ﬂame broadening by turbulent strain- 
ing.

Beginning with Kim & Pitsch [180] and Chakraborty et al. [181] , 
several  authors  have  made  a  distinction  between  ﬂame-induced 
j ,  is 
and  ﬂuid  dynamic  strain  rates.  The  production  term,  n 
equivalent  to  a  ﬂame  normal  strain  rate,  and  accounts  for  the 
straining of the ﬂame surface along its normal direction, leading 
to either ﬂame broadening or thinning. By contrast, the tangential 
strain rate (n 
i j  acting along the ﬂame surface is gener- 
ally assumed to be representative of changes in the ﬂame surface 
area. The study of highly turbulent premixed jet ﬂames by Wang 
et al. [112] showed that the magnitude of the production term is 
small near the jet exit due to preferential alignment of n with e 1 , 
but that this term becomes larger and positive due to the pref- 
erential alignment of n with e 3 further downstream (see Fig. 34 ). 
Similar alignment results have been observed in many other stud- 
ies spanning a range of turbulence intensities (e.g., [196,199] ).

again, dilatation from heat release promotes alignment between e 1 

In summary, in statistically planar and jet premixed ﬂames at 
suﬃciently low turbulence intensities, there is increased alignment 
between n and e 1  in the reaction zone, corresponding to an in- 
crease in the local ﬂame width δt by the ﬂuid dynamic strain rate

strain  rate.  These  terms  are  associated  with  the  nonlinear  cas- 
cade process and the generation of small-scale features in turbu- 
i j and its 
lent ﬂows. Transport equations can also be obtained for S 
magnitude, explicitly revealing the nonlinear coupling between the 
dynamics of the vorticity and strain rate [200,201] . 

In the above transport equations, there are three important re- 
acting ﬂow effects that are not present in constant density, con- 
stant  viscosity  ﬂows.  Namely,  dilatation  dynamically  affects  the 
magnitude of the vorticity and enstrophy, while also changing the 
form of the viscous stress tensor. Second, transport properties, par- 
ticularly the viscosity, are strong functions of the local thermody- 
namic state. For example, Sutherland’s law for the viscosity of an 
ideal gas yields a nearly linear increase in viscosity with temper- 
ature for typical combustion temperatures [202] . Hence, the inﬂu- 
ence of viscous dissipation increases from the reactants to prod- 
ucts. Finally, the combined action of density and pressure gradi- 
ents inﬂuences the turbulence evolution, as expressed through the 
baroclinic torque terms. The baroclinic torque is generally thought 
to contribute to “ﬂame-generated” turbulence and is only substan- 
tially non-zero where gradients of density and pressure are both 
large and misaligned. 

In non-reacting, incompressible turbulent ﬂows with constant 
transport properties, only the ﬁrst (i.e., vortex stretching) and last 
(i.e., viscous transport) terms in the above transport equations are 
non-zero.  The  vortex  stretching  term,  in  particular,  has  received 
considerable attention due to its role in the production and de- 
struction of vorticity. As with studies of scalar gradient dynamics, 
it has been common over the past three decades to examine this 
term via the alignments between the vorticity and the three eigen- 
vectors of the strain rate tensor. In particular, it can be shown that 
the vortex stretching term appearing in Eq. (31) can be written as 

(cid:4)
ω i S i j ω j = S 

(cid:5)
λ1 | e 1 · ω | 2 + λ2 | e 2 · ω | 2 + λ3 | e 3 · ω | 2 

. 

(32) 

In  non-reacting  homogeneous  isotropic  turbulence,  the  result  of 
the  vortex  stretching  process  is  to  preferentially  align  vorticity 
with the eigenvector of the strain rate corresponding to the inter- 
mediate eigenvalue, or e 2 [192] . There is preferential misalignment 
with  the  eigenvector  corresponding  to  the  most  negative  eigen- 
value,  e 3 ,  and  relatively  weak  alignment  with  the  most  positive 
eigenvector, e 1 . The alignment with e 2  has been shown to result 
from the nonlinear coupling between the vorticity and strain rate 
[203,204] ,  although  preferential  alignment  with  the  most  exten- 
sional eigenvector of the background or large-scale strain rate has 
also been identiﬁed [205,206] . 

In a premixed jet ﬂame, Coriton & Frank [201] found that the 
presence  of  combustion  increased  the  magnitude  of  the  vortex 
stretching term and the associated alignment of the vorticity with 
e 2 due to the increased spatial correspondence between large mag- 
nitudes  of  vorticity  and  strain  rate.  Ultimately,  this  change  was 
found to be due to the effects of the increased shear in the re- 
acting jet ﬂame, as compared to a corresponding non-reacting jet, 
and the consequent formation of overlapping “sheets” of large vor- 
ticity and strain rate magnitudes. 

Using  numerical  simulations,  Hamlington  et  al.  [128]  exam- 
ined  the  properties  and  interactions  of  the  vorticity,  strain  rate, 
and  scalar  gradient  in  statistically  planar  premixed  ﬂames  for  a 
range of turbulence intensities, including high intensities (spanning 
Karlovitz numbers between 3.9 and 174). It was found that dilata- 
tion and baroclinic torque were signiﬁcant with respect to vortex 
stretching for low intensities, but that these two effects became 
less signiﬁcant at higher intensities. Moreover, the ﬂame generated 
anisotropy in the orientations of ω 
i  and the strain rate eigenvec- 
tors at low intensities, but this anisotropy was lost for higher in- 
tensities. The alignments between ω 
i , and the strain rate eigen- 
vectors were similar to those found in non-reacting ﬂows for high

i j . However, as the turbulence intensity increases, this alignment 
S 
is lost and there is an increasingly dominant alignment between 
the scalar gradient (or n ) and e 3 , consistent with the dynamics of 
a passive conserved scalar in non-reacting turbulence. The result- 
ing creation of large scalar gradients is of leading-order importance 
for understanding many aspects of the thermochemical complexity 
noted in Section 3 . In particular, the creation of large gradients, as- 
sociated with the strain rate interaction term, leads to the increas- 
ing  dominance  of  molecular  transport  processes  in  the  thermo- 
chemical dynamics. Moreover, since turbulence increases the mag- 
nitudes of both negative and positive gradients, resulting in both 
negative and positive values of transport ﬂuxes, substantial non- 
monotonicity  is  found  along  thermochemical  trajectories  as  the 
turbulence intensity increases [70] . It is cautioned, however, that 
these conclusions must be examined further in practical conﬁgu- 
rations where, for example, there are mean pressure gradients, as 
discussed in the next section.

tion was performed using local values of the kinematic viscosity 
and dissipation to construct the Kolmogorov scales. Consequently, 
vorticity  magnitude  decreased  across  the  ﬂame,  but  the  depen- 
dence on density ratio (connected to dilatation), became weaker 
as Ka δ, K  increased (see, for example, Fig. 36 ). As Ka δ, K  increases, 
baroclinic  torque,  vortex  stretching,  and  viscous  dissipation  all 
increase  in  magnitude,  but  the  scaling  of  the  baroclinic  torque 
with Ka δ, K  is weaker than for the other two effects, resulting in 
the dominance of the vortex stretching and dissipation terms at 
high Ka δ, K (see Fig. 37 ).

equation in statistically planar hydrogen-air premixed ﬂames span-

ing that baroclinic torque has an increasingly minor contribution to 
the overall dynamics as Ka δ, K increases. In this study, Papapastolou 
et al. [208] further conditioned the analysis on the local ﬂow topol-

Many of these results were attributed to the inﬂuence of dilata- 
tion due to ﬂuid expansion by the ﬂame on the coupled dynam- 
ics of ω 
i , although this study did not include explicit 
temperature-dependent  viscous  transport  or  dissipation  terms  in 
the governing equations solved by the simulations. However, the 
decreasing magnitude of the baroclinic torque and dilatation terms 
relative to the vortex stretching and viscous dissipation terms has 
been conﬁrmed in a number of other studies of statistically planar 
premixed ﬂames with homogeneous isotropic turbulence in the re- 
actants, including those by Bobbitt et al. [207] , Ranjan et al. [179] , 
and Papapastolou et al. [208] .

In  particular,  using  DNS  of  statistically  planar  premixed 
temperature-dependent  viscosity,  Bobbitt 
ﬂames, 
et  al.  [207]  showed  that,  at  high  Ka δ, K  (this  study  spanned 
Karlovitz numbers between 70 and 750), the primary balance in 
the vorticity transport equation was between viscous dissipation 
and the vortex stretching term. Contrary to low Ka δ, K  conditions 
where dilatation plays a signiﬁcant role in the dynamics, generally 
resulting in vorticity suppression, at high Ka δ, K the vorticity mag- 
nitude  continues  to  decrease,  but  due  almost  exclusively  to  the 
increase in kinematic viscosity across the ﬂame. Indeed, as Ka δ, K 
increases, Bobbitt et al. [207] showed that the normalized change 
in vorticity magnitude became insigniﬁcant, when the normaliza-

ogy, based on the three invariants of the velocity gradient tensor 
∂ u 
j , showing that topologies corresponding to positive dilata- 
tion have an increasingly weak impact on the dynamics as Ka δ, K 
increases. A related topologically conditioned analysis of a statisti- 
cally planar premixed ﬂame yielded similar results [209] . 

Through an analysis of vorticity alignment for the same statisti- 
cally planar premixed ﬂame conﬁguration as that studied by Bob- 
bitt et al. [207] , Bobbitt & Blanquart [210] have further shown that 
turbulence anisotropy generated by the ﬂame becomes less pro- 
nounced as Ka δ, K  increases. The alignments between ω 
i  and the 
eigenvectors of S 
i j  are similar to those found in non-reacting ho- 
mogeneous isotropic turbulence at high Ka δ, K . For low Ka δ, K , the 
vorticity alignment and corresponding vortex stretching term are 
altered, and the effect of the ﬂame on the vortex stretching term 
was  identiﬁed  as  the  primary  source  of  the  vorticity  anisotropy. 
Wang et al. [112] similarly found using DNS of a highly turbulent 
methane-air premixed jet ﬂame that the alignments between ω 
i 
i j  were  similar  to  those  found  in  non- 
and  the  eigenvectors  of  S 
reacting  ﬂows  (i.e.,  preferential  alignment  between  ω 
i  and  e 2 ). 
Moreover, ω 
i was preferentially aligned with the most extensional 
strain rate of the mean ﬂow, and was preferentially misaligned (or 
i . The former result is sim- 
orthogonal) to the local ﬂame normal n 
ilar to that obtained for sheared non-reacting ﬂows, and the latter 
result is consistent with results for statistically planar ﬂames [128] . 
Zhao et al. [211] also observed a misalignment between ω 
i and n 
i 
for a near-wall quenched premixed ﬂame. 

Despite the overall demonstration in these prior studies of the 
decreasing  signiﬁcance  of  baroclinic  torque  and  ﬂame  generated 
anisotropy as the turbulence intensity increases, substantial gener- 
ation of vorticity and anisotropy by baroclinic torque can occur lo- 
cally and for short periods of time, even at high turbulence inten- 
sities. Signiﬁcantly, Poludnenko [212] showed that, even for highly 
turbulent conditions, statistically planar premixed ﬂames can self- 
accelerate  and  undergo  substantial  vorticity  generation  by  baro- 
clinic torque during periods of high system pressures (see Fig. 38 ). 
Moreover,  this  turbulence  generation  was  found  to  be  strongly 
anisotropic, with the bulk of the baroclinic torque production oc- 
curring transverse to the direction of the mean ﬂow. 

Substantial changes to the dynamics of the vorticity and strain 
rate have also been observed for non-unity Lewis numbers, Le . Us- 
ing DNS of statistically planar premixed ﬂames spanning Karlovitz 
numbers  from  0.54  to  19.5,  Chakraborty  et  al.  [213,214]  found 
that  the  vorticity  magnitude  decreases  across  statistically  planar 
premixed  ﬂames  and  that  the  vorticity  vector  is  predominantly 
aligned with e 2  at higher Ka δ, K , in agreement with results from 
studies  examining  premixed  ﬂames  for  unity  (or  close  to  unity) 
Le . Interestingly, however, alignment with e 1  increases in the re- 
gion of peak heat release within the ﬂame. In particular, for lower 
Ka δ, K with unity Le and for all Ka δ, K with Le < 1 , there is increased, 
although unstable, alignment with e 1 . For small Ka δ, K and Le, in- 
creased alignment was observed with e 3 . These changes with Le 
and Ka δ, K were found to be the result of changes in the inﬂuence 
of dilatation in the ﬂame relative to the effects of vortex stretch- 
ing.  In  two  related  studies,  Chakraborty  et  al.  [215]  and  Dopazo 
et  al.  [216]  also  showed  that  there  is  increased vorticity  magni- 
tude generated within the ﬂame as Le decreases (see Fig. 39 ), and 
that this is accompanied by increased vorticity anisotropy. These 
changes were attributed to the increasing inﬂuence of dilatation 
and baroclinic torque as Le decreases for all Ka δ, K . 

A number of other studies, spanning a range of conditions and 
conﬁgurations, have also contributed to, and largely conﬁrmed, our 
understanding of vorticity-strain rate dynamics and properties dur- 
ing  highly  turbulent  premixed  combustion  in  statistically  planar 
and  jet  ﬂames.  Nilsson  et  al.  [199]  examined  statistically  planar 
ﬂames spanning a range of very high Ka δ, K from 65 to 3,350, show- 
ing that the ﬂow-induced strain rate becomes increasingly larger

than  the  strain  rate  associated  with  ﬂuid  expansion  (i.e.,  dilata- 
tion) by the ﬂame as Ka δ, K increases. The scalar gradient is corre- 
spondingly aligned with e 3 , as in passive scalar evolution in many 
non-reacting ﬂows. It was also shown that, across the ﬂame, the 
vorticity magnitude decreases and the characteristic size of intense 
vortical structures increases.

ing approach to examine the contribution of variously sized eddies 
on the vorticity and strain rate ﬁelds. It was found, in particular,

numbers close to unity have generally found that the effects of di- 
latation and baroclinic torque become less pronounced at higher 
Ka δ, K ,  and  that  the  orientation  of  the  vorticity  and  strain  rate 
eigenvectors  (including  their  relative  alignments  and  anisotropy) 
are also less affected by the ﬂame. However, recent studies of sta- 
tistically planar ﬂames with large pressure oscillations [212] , non- 
unity  Lewis  numbers  [213,214] ,  as  well  as  studies  of  more  re- 
alistic  geometries  with  non-zero  mean  pressure  gradients  [218–
220] , indicate that the correspondence between turbulence in non- 
reacting ﬂows and high- Ka δ, K premixed combustion requires con- 
tinued study. 

It is also important to note that many of the statistically planar 
cases discussed here involve some type of forcing to sustain turbu- 
lence in the region of the ﬂame, resulting in a statistically station- 
ary DNS that is amenable to longer term statistical analysis. As in 
DNS studies of non-reacting turbulence that date back over three 
decades [224] , this forcing is typically implemented as a body force 
in the Navier-Stokes equations and is designed to introduce energy 
primarily  at  the  largest  scales  of  the  ﬂow,  even  when  the  forc- 
ing is also applied within the region of the ﬂame. Both broadband 
[127,207,210] and spectrally truncated [225] linear forcing schemes, 
as well as stochastic methods [69,110,128,212] that introduce veloc- 
ity perturbations at large scales, have been used to study turbulent 
premixed combustion at higher Karlovitz numbers than are typ- 
ically achievable experimentally. In each of these cases, the forc- 
ing is applied both before, within, and downstream of the ﬂame, 
mimicking energy input by larger-scale ﬂow phenomena that are 
independent of the ﬂame itself. To avoid interactions between the 
forcing and the ﬂame, others have pre-computed 3D volumes of 
homogeneous isotropic turbulence which are then fed into the do- 
main [208] , or have forced only the region immediately upstream 
of  the  ﬂame  [199] .  In  each  case,  however,  the  intent  is  to  cre- 
ate a statistically stationary turbulent ﬂame that allows for more 
straightforward  statistical  analyses  than  the  temporally  decaying 
cases studied by, for example, Nishiki et al. [226] and Chakraborty 
et al. [166,213,214] . 

Despite  the  variety  of  forcing  methods  for  statistically  planar 
cases,  however,  observations  regarding  the  vorticity,  strain  rate, 
and scalar gradient dynamics are consistent amongst all studies, 
even those where the forcing is sustained in the ﬂame region and 
those  where  the  turbulence  is  allowed  to  decay.  Although  some 
quantitative differences do exist, particularly when discussing the 
speciﬁc Karlovitz numbers at which different phenomena are ob- 
served,  the  general  trends  for  low  and  high  Karlovitz  behaviors 
are consistent across different studies. This conclusion is also sup- 
ported by Klein et al. [227] , who compared premixed ﬂame results 
from DNS using decaying turbulence, boundary forcing, and linear 
forcing, ﬁnding no notable advantages or disadvantages of any par- 
ticular approach. It is nevertheless still important to specify when 
and how forcing is implemented in numerical simulations, since 
turbulence properties within and downstream of the ﬂame do de- 
pend, at least in part, on the details of the forcing scheme. 

4.2.3. Coherent structures 

To this point, the discussion of vorticity and strain rate has fo- 
cused on ﬁeld quantities, rather than on coherent or isolated struc- 
tures. In the past, a number of studies have explored the interac- 
tions between isolated, often 2D, vortices and ﬂame sheets (see, 
e.g., Mueller et al. [228] ). However, the dynamical signiﬁcance of 
such structures has been called into question, even in non-reacting 
ﬂows, given their apparent lack of impact on nonlinearity and in- 
ertial range dynamics [229] . 

Nevertheless,  many  illustrations  of  turbulence  in  both  non- 
reacting  and  reacting  ﬂows  continue  to  show  isosurfaces  of  the 
vorticity  magnitude  to  reveal  characteristic  tube-like  structures, 
for example those shown in Fig. 41 for a statistically planar pre- 

Fig. 40.  Mean baroclinic torque ( I I I ) and viscous transport ( IV ) conditioned on 
the mean progress variable in a turbulent premixed swirl ﬂame, where Cases 1–

that ﬂame-wall interactions alter vortex stretching by reducing the 
contribution of non-local strain rates and increasing the effect of 
small-scale turbulence. It remains unclear, however, to what extent 
these effects are also present in non-reacting ﬂows, where substan- 
tial variations in the ﬂow and vortex stretching process can also 
occur in the near-wall region. 

It should be noted that much of the current understanding of 
vorticity dynamics and vorticity-strain properties in highly turbu- 
lent premixed combustion is based on studies of statistically pla- 
nar and jet ﬂames. However, recent studies of more realistic con- 
ﬁgurations  have  shown  that  in  instances  where  there  are  mean 
pressure  gradients  imposed  on  the  ﬂow,  such  as  those  found  in 
converging channels [218] and in high-swirl combustors [219,220] , 
the baroclinic torque term can become the dominant effect in the 
overall dynamics, resulting in substantial ﬂame-generated vortic- 
ity. Geikie & Ahmed [218] have shown that the baroclinic torque 
is increasingly dominant in the dynamics as the magnitude of the 
pressure gradient increases. Kazbekov et al. [219,220] observed a 
similar dominance of the barocinic torque term, even for high tur- 
bulence intensities, in a swirl combustor close to the burnt prod- 
uct gases (see the results for Ka δ, K = 20 , 35, and 50 in Fig. 40 ). Lai 
et al. [221] also found an increase in the effect of the baroclinic 
torque in the near-wall region of a quenched high-intensity turbu- 
lent premixed ﬂame. 

Compared  to  studies  of  the  vorticity,  and  vorticity-strain  rate 
interactions in particular, studies of the strain rate ﬁeld itself have 
been somewhat more limited. Coriton & Frank [222] examined the 
strain rate ﬁelds and intermittency in turbulent partially-premixed 
jet ﬂames, and Hampp et al. [223] examined strain rate and vortic- 
ity conditioned to different isosurfaces in a lean premixed opposed 
jet conﬁguration at low Da, showing that there is an increase in 
tangential strain rate due to dilatation. Steinberg et al. [200] exam- 
ined the transport of the principal components of the strain rate in 
a premixed jet ﬂame, including measurements of the strain-strain 
and vorticity interaction terms in the dynamics. These terms were 
found to be weaker in regions with signiﬁcant heat release, due to 
the effects of pressure and density gradients. 

To summarize our current understanding of vorticity and strain 
rate characteristics for highly turbulent premixed combustion, the 
properties  and  dynamics  of  the  vorticity  and  strain  rate  at  high 
Ka δ, K generally correspond to non-reacting results, for Le close to 
unity, outside of periods of large system pressure increases, and 
for ﬂows without a mean pressure gradient. Consequently, stud- 
ies of statistically planar and jet ﬂame conﬁgurations with Lewis

tical structures spanning a wide range of scales. In particular, us- 
ing the cinema stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (PIV) tech- 
niques described in Steinberg et al. [230,232] , Steinberg & Driscoll 
[231] examined the effects of isolated vortices and vortex pairs on 
ﬂame curvature and wrinkling, but found that such canonical con- 
ﬁgurations were present less than 10% of the time in the experi- 
mental data record. More often, much more complex 3D vortical 
structures interacted with the ﬂame front. It was further found in 
this study that straining of the ﬂame surface was caused by coher- 
ent  strain  rate  structures,  while  vortical  structures  were  primar- 
ily responsible for ﬂame wrinkling. This result is consistent with 
the formulation of the governing equations for χ
i  and χ in Eqs. 
(25) and (26) , respectively, where the strain rate has impacts on 
both quantities, while the vorticity only has an explicit impact on 
χ
i .  Similar  strain  rate 
structures were also shown by Steinberg et al. [175] to be impor- 
tant for turbulence-ﬂame interactions in premixed Bunsen ﬂames 
(see Fig. 42 ). 

i  and,  hence,  the  local  ﬂame  orientation  n 

Connected to the appearance of small-scale coherent structures 
is  the  highly  intermittent  spatial  distribution  of  intense  velocity 
gradients in high Reynolds number turbulent ﬂows [235,236] . In 
particular, the dissipation rate ﬁeld is comprised of many ﬁne-scale 
features and is concentrated at small scales, resulting in much of 
the energy in a ﬂow being dissipated within a very small fraction 
of  the  total  ﬂow  volume  [237,238] .  As  the  Reynolds  number  in- 
creases, the fraction of the total volume in which most of the dissi- 
pation occurs decreases, corresponding to an increasingly wide dis- 
tribution of dissipation rates relative to the mean dissipation rate. 
This  intermittency  was  also  noted  in  Section  3.1  in  the  con- 
text of scalar gradients and is evident in comparisons of vorticity 
and strain rate magnitude PDFs. Generally, the vorticity displays a 
wider range of values than the dissipation rate, but both are char- 
acterized by local instantaneous values that can be orders of mag- 
nitude larger than the mean values. These distributions reﬂect the 
spatial structure of the vorticity and dissipation rate values, which 
are small nearly everywhere in high Reynolds number ﬂows, but 
are punctuated by extremely large values at widely spaced loca- 
tions. It has been shown [190] that these behaviors remain gener- 
ally valid in highly turbulent premixed ﬂames, but there are vari- 
ations in the degree of intermittency through the ﬂame. Further 
study across a broader range of ﬂame conﬁgurations is, however, 
still required. 

4.3. Spectral and multi-scale characteristics 

High  Reynolds  number  turbulent  ﬂows  are  characterized  by 
wide  spatial  and  temporal  scale  ranges  [229] ,  and  a  number  of 
approaches have been used to characterize the multi-scale struc- 
ture and dynamics of turbulence. These approaches include spatial 
and temporal correlation functions, structure functions, and spec- 
tra  (computed  using  either  Fourier  or  other  basis  functions).  In 
the following, we will primarily focus on velocity correlation and 
structure  functions  spanning  different  scale  separations,  denoted 
r , and on Fourier spectra of the kinetic energy spanning different 
wavevectors k . 

Using  these  analyses,  substantial  research  has  been  devoted 
over the last decade to addressing the following questions in pre- 
mixed reacting ﬂows spanning a range of turbulence intensities: 

1. How  is  the  multi-scale  structure  of  turbulence  affected  by 
chemical heat release from premixed ﬂames for different condi- 
tions (e.g., Ka δ, K ) and at different locations (e.g., in the unburnt 
reactants or burnt products)? 

2. Is there ﬂame-generated turbulence and transfer of kinetic en- 
ergy from small to large scales due to chemical heat release?

mixed  ﬂame  spanning  a  range  of  turbulence  intensities  [128] . 
Steinberg et al. [230–232] examined the coupled dynamics of the 
vorticity  and  strain  rate,  including  the  evolution  of  intense  vor- 
ticity  and  strain  rate  structures,  in  a  premixed  Bunsen  ﬂame. 
Wang et al. [233] examined the structure of turbulent premixed 
methane-air jet ﬂames over a wide range of turbulence intensities, 
including very large Ka δ, K , with a particular focus on the effects 
of  turbulent  eddies  on  preheat  and  reaction  zone  widths.  Skiba 
et al. [113] have similarly examined the inﬂuence of large eddies 
on  the  wrinkling  and  broadening  of  ﬂame  fronts  in  highly  tur- 
bulent premixed jet ﬂames, ﬁnding that large eddies can in fact 
broaden the ﬂame. 

Beginning  with  the  work  of  Tanahashi  et  al.  [234] ,  it  has 
been known that intense turbulent vortical structures become less 
prevalent in premixed ﬂames. Moreover, the orientation of intense 
vortices becomes increasingly anisotropic. However, this anisotropy 
is  again  lost  as  the  turbulence  intensity  increases.  Hamlington 
et al. [128] studied the alignment of intense vorticity within a sta- 
tistically planar premixed ﬂame and just downstream of the ﬂame 
brush, showing that such intense vorticity is strongly aligned with 
the  mean  ﬂame  normal  direction  for  low  intensities.  This  align- 
ment  is  much  more  pronounced  than  for  the  vorticity  ﬁeld  as 
a  whole  (i.e.,  including  less  intense  vorticity).  Within  the  reac- 
tion zone of the ﬂame, intense vorticity is preferentially aligned 
with the ﬂame normal direction; this alignment is again more pro- 
nounced than for the vorticity ﬁeld as a whole (i.e., not just intense 
vorticity). 

There are additional questions about the representativeness of 
isolated 2D or quasi-2D structures in highly turbulent ﬂows with 
substantial 3D complexity and nonlinear interactions between vor-

3. Are there universal aspects of multi-scale turbulence structure 
and dynamics that span different ﬂame conﬁgurations and con- 
ditions? 

4. Can  classical  theories  of  multi-scale  turbulence  structure  and 
dynamics developed for non-reacting ﬂows be applied to highly 
turbulent premixed ﬂames? 

The  ﬁrst  question  is  motivated  by  the  need  to  quantify  the 
multi-scale  structure  of  turbulence  in  a  variety  of  contexts,  and 
has spawned a number of studies of premixed ﬂames using differ- 
ent multi-scale analysis approaches, as described in the next sec- 
tion. The second question is primarily motivated by the need to 
understand whether the ﬂame disrupts the predominantly net for- 
ward (or down-scale) cascade of kinetic energy found in most non- 
reacting turbulent ﬂows, or whether there is net up-scale transfer 
of energy. This information, in turn, dictates the dynamical effects 
that must be captured by SFS models for LES of highly turbulent 
premixed  reacting  ﬂows.  The  third  question  is  motivated  by  the 
observation that kinetic energy spectra in a variety of non-reacting 
ﬂows (see, e.g., Refs. [82,239] ) collapse to a single universal form. 
It is thus of interest to determine whether there are similar uni- 
versal  aspects  of  multi-scale  turbulence  structure  and  dynamics, 
either across different premixed reacting ﬂows or across both non- 
reacting and reacting ﬂows. 

The ﬁnal question is motivated by the success of the Richardson 
energy cascade concept and the Kolmogorov hypotheses [240] in 
describing multi-scale turbulence structure and dynamics in non- 
reacting  ﬂows.  Brieﬂy,  the  three  Kolmogorov  hypotheses  are  the 
following [82] : ( i ) Turbulence at suﬃciently small scales is homo- 
geneous, isotropic, and stationary, ( ii ) Turbulence statistics at suf- 
ﬁciently small scales are universal and depend only on the kine- 
matic viscosity ν, the mean dissipation rate ε, and the scale (i.e., 
r in  physical  space  or  the  wavenumber  k  in  Fourier  space),  and 
( iii ) Turbulence statistics in an intermediate range of scales smaller 
than the energy input scale and larger than the dissipation scale 
are universal and depend only on ε and the scale. These hypothe- 

ses are fundamentally based on the Richardson cascade model of 
energy transfer in turbulent ﬂows [238] , whereby energy input at 
large  scales  is  assumed  to  be  transferred  non-dissipatively  from 
larger  to  smaller  scales  until  viscous  dissipation  becomes  suﬃ- 
ciently strong to dissipate energy at small scales. The third hypoth- 
esis, in particular, establishes the existence of an ‘inertial’ range of 
scales where energy cascades non-dissipatively between scales. 

Although the Kolmogorov hypotheses and Richardson cascade 
concept are substantial simpliﬁcations of the true physics govern- 
ing  real-world  ﬂows,  both  have  proven  remarkably  successful  at 
providing physical space and spectral scaling laws that are in close 
agreement with experimental and DNS data across a wide range 
of ﬂows [82,239] . These scaling laws include the prediction of a 
k −5 / 3 inertial range scaling of the kinetic energy spectrum, where 
k = | k | is the wavevector magnitude, and of an r N/ 3 scaling of the 
Nth-order velocity structure function, where r = | r | is the magni- 
tude of the spatial separation vector. These scaling laws, which are 
fundamentally based on the Kolmogorov hypotheses and Richard- 
son cascade concept, are generally successful for small N in non- 
reacting (i.e., constant density and viscosity) turbulence [229] , but 
are known to become inaccurate for larger N due to intermittency 
effects [238] . Departures from these classical scaling relations in 
highly turbulent reacting ﬂows will be discussed in more detail in 
the context of spectral and multi-scale structure in Section 4.3.1 . 

In  the  following,  we  review  recent  research  on  spectral  and 
multi-scale  analyses  of  turbulence  during  highly  turbulent  pre- 
mixed combustion. Early effort s to underst and spectra and multi- 
scale structure in turbulent combustion were made by examining 
reactants and products separately (i.e., outside the ﬂame) [241,242] , 
and  also  by  examining  non-premixed  ﬂames  [243] .  Here  we  re- 
view more recent attempts to understand the spectral and multi- 
scale characteristics of turbulence across a range of conditions and 
ﬂame locations during highly turbulent premixed combustion, with 
a particular focus on attempts to address the questions outlined 
above.

4.3.1. Spectral and multi-scale structure 

A  number  of  approaches  have  recently  been  used  to  under- 
stand spectral properties of turbulence in premixed ﬂames, includ- 
ing both physical and Fourier space analyses. The governing equa- 
tion for the two-point velocity correlation was examined in detail 
by Kolla et al. [84,85] for a temporally developing premixed shear 
layer at a range of turbulence intensities. In these studies, it was 
found that there is a spectral bump in the kinetic energy spectrum 
near the scale of the ﬂame, and that this feature is due speciﬁcally 
to  dilatation  associated  with  the  ﬂame  (see  Fig.  43 ).  Using  con- 
ditional density-weighted kinetic energy and scalar spectra, Kolla 
et al. [84] further showed that turbulence spectra collapse to clas- 
sical Kolmogorov predictions (i.e., the k −5 / 3 inertial range scaling) 
only at intermediate scales far from the ﬂame scale. 

Using  2D  kinetic  energy  spectra  conditioned  on  the  planar- 
averaged reactant mass fraction, Towery et al. [88] examined DNS 
of  a  lower  intensity  statistically  planar  premixed  ﬂame  (with 
Ka δ, K = 20 , but a turbulence intensity of only u (cid:2) /S L = 2 . 5 ) to show 
that  turbulent  small-scale  motions  are  suppressed  in  the  burnt 
combustion  products  (see  Fig.  44 ).  This  result  persists  even  for 
higher  turbulence  intensities,  as  was  shown  for  a  similar  statis- 
tically  planar  premixed  ﬂame  conﬁguration  using  a  conditional 
wavelet analysis by Kim et al. [244] . Due to the use of non-density 
weighted  statistics,  however,  neither  of  these  studies  revealed  a 
spectral  bump  near  the  scale  of  the  ﬂame,  as  was  found  in  the 
studies by Kolla et al. [84,85] . 

It should be noted that each of these prior analyses were based 
on  planar-averaged  combustion  progress  variables,  complicating 
the interpretation of the results in physical space. As a result of 
this diﬃculty, conditionally averaged structure functions have re- 
cently been used to study the multiscale structure of turbulence in 
highly turbulent premixed combustion. Velocity structure functions 
correspond to moments of velocity difference distributions for dif- 
ferent  separation  distances;  that  is  (cid:14)| u 
i ( x ) | N (cid:15) ,  where 
the average (cid:14)·(cid:15) denotes either a conditional or unconditional, en- 
semble  or  Favre,  average  and  N is  the  structure  function  order. 
Structure functions are closely related to the correlation functions 
studied by Kolla et al. [84,85] , and research on non-reacting tur- 
bulence  has  shown  that  these  structure  functions  have  power- 
law r dependencies as predicted using scale similarity and dimen- 

i ( x + r ) − u 

sional  arguments,  but  their  exponent  values  indicate  increasing 
non-Gaussianity and intermittency as the order increases [229] . 

Using  DNS  of  statistically  planar  premixed  ﬂames,  Whitman 
et al. [245] examined conditional velocity structure functions over 
turbulence intensities u (cid:2) /S L ≈ 2 –10 (corresponding to Ka δ, K ≈ 20 –
170). The conditioning was based on the local ﬂame temperature 
at the ﬁrst of the two points used to compute each velocity differ- 
ence, and both separation directions and velocity components were 
aligned  either  parallel  or  tangentially  to  the  local  ﬂame  normal. 
It  was  found  that,  for  high  Ka δ, K  conditions,  the  structure  func- 
tions approached the r N/ 3 scaling predicted using the Kolmogorov 
hypotheses for suﬃciently large r, and that the curves at differ- 
ent  locations  in  the  ﬂame  could  be  collapsed  using  condition- 
ally averaged values of the Kolomogorov scale and dissipation rate 
(see Fig. 45 ). At low Ka δ, K , the importance of heat release, most 
likely due to the increasing importance of dilatation and baroclinic 
torque in the dynamics, was found to prevent the collapse of the 
different curves. Interestingly, the collapse at higher Ka δ, K observed 
by Whitman et al. [245] mirrors the earlier results from Bobbitt 
et al. [207] , who showed that, when normalizing by local values 
of the kinematic viscosity and dissipation rate (i.e., using local Kol- 
mogorov scales), the normalized vorticity magnitude was similar 
on either side of a highly turbulent premixed ﬂame. The collapse in 
both cases reﬂects the purely kinematic effect of the ﬂame on tur- 
bulence at highly turbulent conditions in statistically planar con- 
ﬁgurations; that is, heat release by the ﬂame increases the ﬂuid 
viscosity which, in turn, increases viscous dissipation and reduces 
the local Reynolds number. 

Sabelnikov et al. [246,247] also performed conditional structure 
analyses of statistically planar premixed ﬂames, although for lower 
turbulence  intensities  and  using  conditioning  based  on  whether 
the two velocity locations were in the reactants, ﬂame region, or 
products.  Due  to  the  low  intensity  of  the  cases  examined,  sub- 
stantial  differences  in  the  structure  function  statistics  were  ob- 
served  compared  to  non-reacting  ﬂows,  with  a  substantial  im- 
pact from dilatation by the ﬂame. This dilatation also generated 
increased anisotropy in the ﬂame. A related analysis by Brearley 
et al. [248] examined the same conditional structure functions for 
a more turbulent premixed ﬂame, again ﬁnding substantial effects 
due to dilatation and the creation of anisotropy by the ﬂame. Inter- 
estingly, this study showed that even structure functions computed

of the uncertainty principle are fundamental and cannot be over- 
come. 

Connected to the study of multi-scale structure, a renewed fo- 
cus  must  be  placed  on  understanding  the  effects  of  internal  in- 
termittency and on developing new phenomenological theories of 
turbulence  at  highly  turbulent  conditions.  Even  in  non-reacting 
ﬂows, the Kolmogorov hypotheses become increasingly inaccurate 
for higher-order quantities, such as velocity structure functions of 
order four or higher [238] . These deviations from Kolmogorov scal- 
ing laws are often called “anomalous” scaling, and are the result 
of internal intermittency at the intermediate range of scales. Such 
intermittency causes a break-down in the assumption of scale sim- 
ilarity within the inertial range, and corrections to the Kolmogorov 
scaling laws have been proposed by Kolmogorov and many oth- 
ers (see Ref. [229] for a review). Given these observations in non- 
reacting  ﬂows,  it  is  diﬃcult  to  disentangle  the  underlying  rea- 
sons for the departures from classical scaling laws, for example for 
structure functions of order N = 3 and 4 in Fig. 45 . These depar- 
tures could be due simply to the increasing importance of inter- 
mittency effects as N increases, but during premixed combustion, 
particularly in the presence of non-unity Lewis numbers and mean 
pressure gradients, modiﬁcations of the Kolmogorov scaling laws 
may be necessary. 

4.3.2. Spectral and multi-scale dynamics 

Even after the spectral and multi-scale structure of turbulence 
has been quantiﬁed through the ﬂame, there is the remaining mat- 
ter of exactly which direction (i.e., up or down scale) combustion 
processes  cause  energy  to  move  in  a  turbulent  reacting  ﬂow.  In 
the  classical  picture  of  turbulence  developed  by  Richardson  and 
Kolmogorov [240,250] , energy input on large scales cascades non- 
dissipatively through the inertial range until it is eventually dis- 
sipated as heat by viscous processes at small scales. Despite this 
classical picture, however, it is still possible for energy to be trans- 
ferred from small to large scales; that is, it is possible for there to 
be “backscatter” of energy. There are at least three possible sources 
of backscatter in turbulent combustion, as described in the follow- 
ing. 

1. From  the  dynamics  of  the  energy  cascade  in  spectral-space, 
it  can  be  shown  that  even  though  the  net  cascade  is  typi- 
cally down-scale in 3D turbulent ﬂows, nonlinear inertial pro- 
cesses are responsible for a measurable amount of up-scale en- 
ergy transfer [251] . This up-scale transfer occurs even in non- 
reacting homogeneous isotropic turbulence and is typically ex- 
amined  through  calculation  and  partitioning  of  triadic  inter- 
actions [252–257] into positive (i.e., down-scale) and negative 
(i.e., up-scale) contributions. The existence of this up-scale en- 
ergy transfer is well-known [82] and many effort s have been 
made to capture this physical backscatter in SFS models for LES 
[251,258–264] . In most cases, however, such SFS models have 
proven to be insuﬃciently dissipative due to inaccurate predic- 
tions of local, instantaneous backscatter, resulting in unstable 
simulations for most practical problems [264] . 

2. Heat release by combustion causes ﬂuid expansion, which re- 
sults  in  a  suppression  of  small-scale  turbulence  [128] .  More- 
over,  recent  results  indicate  that  while  small  scales  are  sup- 
pressed,  there  is  a  corresponding  increase  in  the  kinetic  en- 
ergy of large scales (or the mean ﬂow). There are indications 
that much of this change occurs due to pressure-dilatation ef- 
fects [249] , although turbulent advective processes associated 
with the cascade process have also been shown to create net 
energy  backscatter  near  the  scale  of  the  ﬂame  [88] .  Another 
manifestation of combustion-related backscatter is a large-scale 
change in the ﬂow due to a small-scale event. This can occur, 
for  example,  when  there  is  a  locally  extreme  temperature  or

(e,f) u (cid:2) /S L = 9 . 9 . Results are shown for longitudinal structure functions both (a,c,e)

is shown by blue dashed lines and the Kolmogorov scaling r N/ 3 

purely in the reactants just upstream of the ﬂame differ from non- 
reacting results. 

Ultimately, the multi-scale characterization of turbulence struc- 
ture  in  premixed  ﬂames  remains  a  subject  of  substantial  ongo- 
ing research. It is unclear, in particular, to what extent the spatial 
variability associated with premixed ﬂames has affected all results 
obtained to date. Each of the studies described here have sought 
to examine multi-scale structure at different locations within, or 
near, premixed ﬂames, and various Fourier and spatial domain ap- 
proaches have been used. However, as noted by Kim et al. [244] , 
questions  requiring  both  spatial  and  spectral  localization  are  ill- 
posed due to the uncertainty principle applied to such analyses. 
That is, the degree of spatial localization decreases as the spectral 
localization increases, and vice versa. In this respect, the wavelet 
analysis  used  by  Kim  et  al.  [244]  offers  the  best  control  over 
the respective spatial and spectral localizations, at the expense of 
substantially increased complexity compared to other approaches. 
Even using this and related approaches, however, the limitations

pressure that causes, for example, auto-ignition [265] or deﬂa- 
gration to detonation transition (DDT) [266] . A recent study by 
Poludnenko [212] has also shown that certain ﬂames exhibit a 
“pulsating behavior”, resulting in pressure pulses emitted from 
the ﬂame that affect distant locations. These events are typi- 
cally initiated at very small scales but can have enormous con- 
sequences for the larger-scale behavior of the system. 

3. In strictly 2D turbulent ﬂows, which occur most frequently in 
geophysical contexts at very large scales (e.g., hurricanes and 
mesoscale eddies in the ocean), the nonlinear vortex stretch- 
ing process that leads to the transfer of energy from large to 
small scales in most 3D ﬂows is no longer active. As a result, 
it has been observed that in 2D turbulence, there is an inverse 
cascade of kinetic energy and a forward cascade of enstrophy, 
or vorticity magnitude [267] . From a physical standpoint, this 
means  that  small  eddies  in  2D  turbulence  coalesce  to  form 
larger eddies, by contrast to the break-up of large eddies into 
smaller  eddies  found  in  classical  non-reacting  3D  turbulence. 
This is a very particular type of energy backscatter that is likely 
to only be present in 2D simulations of turbulent combustion, 
or in certain special circumstances where anisotropy generated 
by the ﬂame results in quasi-2D ﬂow. 

It should additionally be noted that both computations [268–
270] and experiments [271,272] have revealed a “bump” in the ki- 
netic energy spectrum near the transition between the inertial and 
dissipation ranges. Although not an example of backscatter in the 
traditional sense, this bump is associated with the build-up of ki- 
netic energy at the bottom of the inertial range and results in a 
modest and localized increase in spectral kinetic energy at large 
wavenumbers, by contrast to the monotonically decreasing spectral 
kinetic energy associated with the classical cascade process. The 
resulting effect is termed the “bottleneck” and has been explained 
[273] as resulting from the relatively rapid decrease of spectral ki- 
netic energy at small scales (i.e., in the dissipation range) and in- 
suﬃciently broad inertial ranges. As a result, the energy collects 
at the bottom of the inertial range and creates a bump in the en- 
ergy spectrum. When there is insuﬃcient dissipation of energy in 
an LES or DNS of a turbulent ﬂow, energy can also “pile-up” at 
small-scales and begin to pollute larger scale motions. This effect 
is, however, non-physical and could be termed the “numerical bot- 
tleneck.”

The  relative  importance  of  each  source  of  backscatter  in  the 
list above is still being understood in premixed combustion. Using 
differential ﬁltering in physical space, O’Brien et al. [249,274] ex- 
amined  energy  transfer  between  subﬁlter  and  resolved  scales  in 
the compressible, Favre-ﬁltered Navier-Stokes equations using DNS 
of both diffusion [274] and premixed [249] ﬂames. An analysis of 
DNS data for a statistically planar premixed ﬂame at a turbulence 
intensity of u (cid:2) /S L = 2 . 5 ( Ka δ, K = 20 ) showed that SFS backscatter 
occurs primarily in regions undergoing dilatation due to heat re- 
lease (see Fig. 46 ). This net backscatter was found to be predomi- 
nantly due to the correlation between the velocity and pressure- 

gradient  in  the  region  of  highest  heat  release.  Backscatter  was 
also  found  to  occur  due  to  nonlinear  advective  effects,  although 
this  effect  was  generally  weaker  than  that  due  to  the  velocity 
pressure-gradient dilatation. This result is largely consistent with 
the purely spatial domain analyses of the kinetic energy dynam- 
ics described in Section 4.1 , and both Wang & Abraham [165] and 
MacArt  et  al.  [164]  have  shown  that,  at  low  Ka δ, K ,  the  velocity 
pressure-gradient correlation term is dominant in the kinetic en- 
ergy dynamics. 

With  respect  to  the  inter-scale  transfer  of  energy  by  nonlin- 
ear advective effects, Towery et al. [88] used a conditional Fourier 
spectral  analysis  to  examine  the  exchange  of  energy  between 
scales and the net direction of the cascade process in a statisti- 
cally  planar  premixed  ﬂame  at  Ka δ, K = 20 .  This  analysis  showed 
that, within the ﬂame brush close to the burnt products, nonlin- 
ear advective processes preferentially transfer energy from small 
to large scales. This net backscatter of energy is contrary to the 
net forward cascade of energy found in non-reacting turbulence. In 
this study, the inverse energy cascade was found to extend from 
slightly smaller than the scale of the ﬂame up to the turbulence 
integral scale. However, determining whether this inverse cascade 
remains  scale-local  to  the  ﬂame,  or  always  extends  to  the  inte- 
gral scale, was made diﬃcult by the relatively small separation be- 
tween (cid:2) and δ0 

L  in this study. 

Finally,  the  conditional  wavelet  analysis  of  a  higher  intensity 
(where  Ka δ, K = 72 )  statistically  planar  premixed  ﬂame  by  Kim 
et  al.  [244]  showed  that,  in  the  ﬂow  as  a  whole,  the  spectral 
dynamics  were  largely  similar  to  that  found  in  non-reacting  in- 
compressible turbulent ﬂows, with net down-scale transfers of en- 
ergy  due  to  advective  and  pressure  gradient  effects.  Once  again, 
however, within the ﬂame brush near the region of greatest heat 
release,  both  of  these  effects  reverse  direction,  resulting  in  up- 
scale transfer of kinetic energy. The resulting net effect is relatively 
weak  up-scale  energy  transfer  (or  at  least  substantially  weak- 
ened down-scale transfer) for intermediate values of the progress 
variable. 

Returning to the questions posed at the beginning of this sec- 
tion, tentative and preliminary answers are now available. Turbu- 
lent  small  scale  motions  are  generally  suppressed  through  pre- 
mixed ﬂames at high turbulence intensities, due primarily to the 
effects  of  increased  viscous  dissipation  associated  with  chemical 
heat  release.  At  lower  turbulence  intensities,  there  is  evidence 
of  ﬂame-generated  turbulence,  up-scale  net  energy  transfer,  and 
backscatter, none of which are explicitly addressed by purely (or 
mostly) dissipative SFS models developed for LES of non-reacting 
turbulence. At highly turbulent conditions, it appears that the Kol- 
mogorov hypotheses remain relevant, at least for statistically pla- 
nar premixed ﬂames, and that results for different ﬂame locations, 
conditions, and conﬁgurations can be collapsed using locally de- 
ﬁned Kolmogorov scales. Tentatively, there are thus indications that 
there may be universal aspects of spectral and multi-scale turbu- 
lence characteristics during highly turbulent premixed combustion.

It  should  be  cautioned,  however,  that  although  these  stud- 
ies  provide  a  consistent  view  of  up-scale  kinetic  energy  trans- 
fer  by  nonlinear  advective  and  pressure-gradient  effects  in  pre- 
mixed  ﬂames  at  moderate  values  of  Ka δ, K ,  each  study  was  fo- 
cused on DNS data of statistically planar premixed ﬂames stochas- 
tically forced at large scales. Moreover, two of these studies (i.e., 
Refs. [88,249] ) examined the same DNS data set. It is thus now 
important  to  perform  similar  analyses  of  spectral  kinetic  energy 
dynamics in a broader range of ﬂows, particularly those involving 
mean shear, geometric complexity, and persistent pressure gradi- 
ents. The effects of different forcing mechanisms—including the ab- 
sence  of  forcing,  as  in  DNS  of  premixed  ﬂames  interacting  with 
decaying  turbulence—must  also  be  examined  in  more  detail  to 
quantify the dependence of these results on the energy injection 
method.  Stronger  claims  of  universality,  in  particular,  cannot  be 
made until these studies have been undertaken. Kazbekov & Stein- 
berg [275] have begun taking initial steps in this direction using 
experimental measurements of premixed swirl ﬂames and physical 
space ﬁltering, revealing mean up-scale energy transfer within the 
ﬂame across scales in the range of the laminar ﬂame thickness for 
moderate Karlovitz numbers. 

result, even in reacting ﬂows where there is no net backscatter 
of energy, the assumption of a ﬁlter cutoff for LES in the inertial 
range, as well as the assumption of uniform equilibrium down- 
scale transfer of energy, may become inaccurate. 

It should be noted that the last two summary points relate to 
the manner in which turbulence is modeled, in either RANS or LES 
approaches,  for  highly  turbulent  conditions.  Although  no  model 
has yet been developed to explicitly account for these insights, re- 
cent studies of highly turbulent statistically planar and jet ﬂames 
have shown that many of the assumptions central to models for 
non-reacting ﬂows (e.g., the gradient transport hypothesis and net 
down-scale energy transfer) are still relevant at highly turbulent 
conditions. However, the same may not be true for more compli- 
cated  and  physically  realistic  ﬂows,  such  as  swirl  [219,220]  and 
bluff body [218] conﬁgurations where there is known to be sub- 
stantial turbulence production at small scales by baroclinic torque. 
Before non-reacting models can be conﬁdently applied at highly 
turbulent conditions, additional work must be done to understand 
kinetic energy dynamics in these and other more realistic conﬁgu- 
rations. 

4.4. Summary 

5. Outlook 

Our understanding of the properties — both kinematic and dy- 
namic — of turbulence during highly turbulent premixed combus- 
tion  has  advanced  considerably  over  the  past  decade.  From  the 
studies  and  prior  research  summarized  in  this  section,  we  now 
know, in particular, that: 

1. Turbulence  characteristics  are  similar  to  those  found  in  corre- 
sponding non-reacting ﬂows for highly turbulent statistically pla- 
nar and jet premixed ﬂames. This includes the dynamics of the 
turbulence kinetic energy and stresses, the coupled dynamics 
and properties of the vorticity and strain rate, and the appli- 
cability of the Kolmogorov hypotheses and Richardson cascade 
concept. The creation of anisotropy by the ﬂame also weakens 
as the turbulence intensity increases for these ﬂows. 

2. The primary effect of the  ﬂame on turbulence for highly turbu- 
lent  statistically  planar  and  jet  premixed  ﬂames  is  kinematic  in 
nature  and  results  from  the  increase  in  temperature  dependent 
viscosity due to chemical heat release. This accounts for the col- 
lapse of vorticity and structure function results when normal- 
izing statistics either side of a premixed ﬂame using local (or 
conditioned) values of the kinematic viscosity and viscous dis- 
sipation rate. 

3. Turbulence  characteristics  can  be  substantially  affected  by  the 
ﬂame, beyond simply the kinematic viscous effect, even at highly 
turbulent  conditions  due  to  non-unity  Lewis  numbers,  mean 
pressure-gradients, and pressure pulsations. These conditions re- 
sult in the continued importance, and even dominance, of di- 
latation,  baroclinic  torque,  and  velocity-pressure  gradient  ef- 
fects as the turbulence intensity increases, weakening the simi- 
larity to corresponding non-reacting ﬂows during highly turbu- 
lent premixed combustion. 

4. The gradient transport (or Boussinesq) hypothesis is as applicable 
for  highly  turbulent  premixed  statistically  planar  and  jet  ﬂames 
as for corresponding non-reacting ﬂows, but this hypothesis is un- 
likely to remain valid in more practically relevant ﬂows. In partic- 
ular, non-unity Lewis numbers and mean pressure gradients are 
likely to create counter-gradient transport even at highly turbu- 
lent conditions, similar to results for lower turbulence intensi- 
ties. 

5. There is a weakening of the forward kinetic energy cascade even 
in highly turbulent statistically planar premixed ﬂames, and there 
is a net backscatter of energy for lower turbulence intensities. As a 

Through  this  paper,  we  hope  to  have  provided  a  succinct 
summary  of  the  current  state-of-knowledge  regarding  the  struc- 
ture and dynamics of highly turbulent premixed ﬂames. Summary 
points are included at the ends of Sections 2 –4 and are not re- 
peated  here.  Instead,  we  present  a  brief  outlook;  although  we 
have  substantially  increased  our  knowledge  of  highly  turbulent 
premixed combustion in a relatively short period of time, our cur- 
rent understanding does motivate several new areas of inquiry and 
study. 

Fundamentally, the community needs to critically assess the va- 
lidity  and  utility  of  deﬁning  combustion  regimes  in  real  conﬁg- 
urations  at  highly  turbulent  conditions.  At  a  minimum,  consen- 
sus must be reached on a standardized method of characterizing 
ﬂames in systems with widely varying turbulence properties, many 
of which simultaneously generate and attenuate  turbulence over 
the  ﬂame  brush.  Furthermore,  additional  care  must  be  taken  in 
the design of experimental conﬁgurations to ensure that the rapid 
mixing between the targeted experiment and the surroundings—
induced  by  intense  turbulence—does  not  alter  the  thermochem- 
istry in the ﬂame brush. While both experiments and DNS have 
progressed considerably, there remain leading order discrepancies 
(e.g., between measured and simulated turbulent ﬂame speed en- 
hancement)  that  require  reconciliation  through  improved  under- 
standing of both the combustion thermochemistry and turbulence 
dynamics. 

From  the  perspective  of  advancing  understanding  of  thermo- 
chemistry  in  highly  turbulent  ﬂames,  one  approach  is  to  quan- 
tify the multi-dimensional thermochemical space; e.g., its dimen- 
sionality, dynamic evolution, and impact on local and global ﬂame 
characteristics,  etc.  The  underlying  physico-chemical  conditions 
that  create  this  high-dimensional  space  should  also  be  under- 
stood  and  quantiﬁed.  In  particular,  connecting  the  dynamics  of 
turbulent ﬂames to fundamental ﬂame properties—such as lami- 
nar  ﬂame  speed,  extinction  and  ignition  residence  times  in  per- 
fectly stirred reactors, and homogeneous auto-ignition—can be at- 
tempted. Experimentally, simultaneous multi-scalar and/or scalar- 
velocity measurements can facilitate such  understanding, in par- 
ticular under conditions that are computationally challenging for 
DNS.  Theoretically,  scaling  analysis  of  the  turbulent  ﬂame  speed 
should be expanded to consider contributions from the local con- 
ditions, instead of relying on a single laminar ﬂame speed to scale 
the entire thermochemistry.

With  established  physical  understanding  and  quantitative  de- 
scription  of  thermochemistry,  improvements  in  modeling  can  be 
attempted. One particular challenge in modeling highly turbulent 
premixed ﬂames is that the rich small-scale ﬂame structures and 
dynamics  can  potentially  occur  entirely  at  sub-ﬁlter  scales.  As 
most existing turbulent combustion models have certain intrinsic 
assumptions regarding the dimensionality of the thermochemical 
space, it is important to incorporate the latest understanding into 
modeling studies. 

Two approaches have emerged going forward: one is to con- 
tinue improving existing turbulent combustion models, leveraging 
new physical understanding, DNS data, and computational and ex- 
perimental diagnostics. This approach has been constantly pursued 
and  progressively  perfected.  The  second  approach  is  to  develop 
adaptive modeling [276] . The adaptivity can manifest in terms of 
adaptive mesh resolutions around different ﬂame features. For ex- 
ample, recent developments on combining adaptive mesh reﬁne- 
ment  [277]  with  local  ﬂame  feature  detection  resolve  premixed 
ﬂame fronts such that local ﬂame speed can be adequately cap- 
tured.  Embedding  DNS  into  LES  is  another  idea  to  ensure  that 
multi-modal  ﬂame  features  can  be  captured  without  prohibitive 
computational  cost.  The  adaptivity  can  also  manifest  as  model 
adaptivity, such as in [106,277] where different turbulent combus- 
tion models are selected for different regions of a turbulent ﬂame. 
For either approach, robust coupling and transition among differ- 
ent combustion models or different mesh resolutions remain out- 
standing challenges. 

Chemical  kinetic  modelling  is  closely  connected  to  turbulent 
combustion  closure  models.  The  recent  development  of  lumped 
chemical kinetic models, such as HyChem [20,21] , has set a good 
example  in  reducing  the  complexities  of  chemistry  for  real  fu- 
els.  Further  model  reduction  to  10–30  species  is  often  required 
to  enable  DNS  or  LES.  It  is  important  to  recognize  the  impact 
from abundant, and sometimes extreme, thermochemical states in 
highly turbulent ﬂames when constructing reduced kinetic models; 
their  veriﬁcation  and  validation  should  be  expanded  to  account 
for  possible  thermochemical  states  that  are  created  in  turbulent 
ﬂames. Construction and reduction of chemical kinetic models is 
another area that beneﬁts from a physical and quantitative under- 
standing of the high-dimensional thermochemical state space. 

In  order  to  understand  this  state  space  under  more  practi- 
cal  conditions,  characterization  of  large  hydrocarbon  fuels  under 
pressurized  conditions  is  necessary  to  reach  conditions  close  to 
those in Table 1 . Moreover, most existing studies focus on gaseous 
ﬂames; interactions between highly turbulent reacting ﬂows and 
sprays are comparatively less studied. Droplet motion, evaporation, 
and heat transfer introduce additional sinks/sources to alter local 
compositional space (i.e., temperature and species), and introduce 
additional time and length scales to the dynamics of combustion. 
An  experimental  framework  targeting  model  validation,  such  as 
that reported in [278] for dilute acetone/ethanol sprays, should be 
initiated for a larger variety of fuels under highly turbulent condi- 
tions. Development of DNS in simulating spray ﬂames should also 
receive more attention. 

From the perspective of understanding turbulence structure and 
dynamics, the analyses of turbulence kinetic energy, stresses, and 
ﬂuxes described in Section 4.1 , as well as the spectral and multi- 
scale analyses described in Section 4.3 , must now be extended to 
more realistic ﬂows and conditions that include non-unity Lewis 
numbers,  mean  pressure  gradients,  solid  boundaries,  and  other 
practically  relevant  ﬂow  effects.  Recent  research  has  shown  that 
our  understanding  of  turbulence  properties  based  on  the  study 
of  only  statistically  planar  and  jet  conﬁgurations  is  incomplete 
and not necessarily representative of more realistic conﬁgurations. 
However, progress has already been made towards understanding 
vorticity  dynamics  in  such  conﬁgurations  [218–220] ,  and  similar 

studies must now be undertaken to more fully understand impacts 
on turbulence statistics and spectra. 

The further study of these statistics and spectra will also pro- 
vide insights into new model forms for numerical simulations of 
practical  highly  turbulent  premixed  combustion  using  RANS  and 
LES approaches. Current studies have demonstrated the inadequacy 
of the gradient transport hypothesis and purely and uniformly dis- 
sipative SFS models, particularly for moderate and low turbulence 
intensities, and now further work must be carried out to formulate 
new models that are sensitive to local ﬂow conditions (e.g., the lo- 
cal Karlovitz and Damköhler numbers) across a broader range of 
practical conﬁgurations. 

The renewed study  of internal intermittency  as a function of 
conﬁguration and local turbulence-ﬂame conditions is also an im- 
portant area of further research. From an operational standpoint, 
turbulence can lead to unexpectedly high probabilities of extreme 
events, such as local increases in pressure, temperature, and scalar 
gradients. Each of these events can lead to undesirable transient 
phenomena such as extinction, ignition, or deﬂagration to detona- 
tion transition of reactive mixtures at diﬃcult-to-predict locations 
and times. The onset of these extreme events—which arise locally, 
often at small scales, with signiﬁcant global consequences—is in- 
trinsically connected to the intermittent character of turbulence. 

In  general,  internal  intermittency  becomes  more  pronounced 
as the turbulence intensity increases, and increased probabilities 
of extreme gradients (e.g., in temperature or pressure) associated 
with highly turbulent conditions may result in global changes to 
system properties. Recent research, for example, has indicated that 
turbulence-induced ﬂuctuations in thermodynamic quantities can 
lead to detonation formation in highly turbulent auto-igniting reac- 
tant mixtures [225] , as well as in highly turbulent deﬂagrating sys- 
tems [212,279] . The understanding of how such transitions can be 
predicted, particularly at highly turbulent conditions, remains an 
important direction for future study. Further study is also required 
to determine whether the fundamental assumptions encompassed 
by the Kolmogorov hypotheses, including the presence of a univer- 
sal equilibrium range, remain valid in premixed reacting ﬂows over 
a variety of conditions. 

Finally, complexity and turbulent mixing have previously been 
characterized in non-reacting ﬂows through the dispersion of ﬂuid 
parcels or tracer quantities. This dispersion can be quantiﬁed in an 
Eulerian sense using ﬂuxes, but can also be characterized through 
a Lagrangian approach that tracks the separation of two initially 
close ﬂuid parcels in time [280] . In turbulent ﬂows, these parcels 
move apart at a rate speciﬁed by the Lyapunov exponents, where 
positive exponents indicate a nonlinear unstable dynamical system 
characterized by an extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. The 
separation of these tracer parcels has been connected to turbulent 
diffusion, with studies showing more rapid separation of tracers in 
turbulent, as compared to laminar, ﬂows (see Refs. [281,282] for re- 
views). Similar to the new insights obtained from Lagrangian anal- 
yses of thermochemical trajectories, Lagrangian analyses of turbu- 
lence  properties  and  ﬂuid  particle  dispersion  may  result  in  new 
models  of  turbulent  transport  during  highly  turbulent  premixed 
combustion.
