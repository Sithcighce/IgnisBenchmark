Petroleum-derived gasoline is currently the most widely used fuel for transportation propulsion. The design and oper-
ation of gasoline fuels is governed by specific physical and chemical kinetic fuel properties. These must be thoroughly
understood in order to improve sustainable gasoline fuel technologies in the face of economical, technological, and
societal challenges. For this reason, surrogate mixtures are formulated to emulate the thermophysical, thermochemi-
cal, and chemical kinetic properties of the real fuel, so that fundamental experiments and predictive simulations can
be conducted. Early studies on gasoline combustion typically adopted single component or binary mixtures (n-hep-
tane/isooctane) as surrogates. However, the last decade has seen rapid progress in the formulation and utilization of
ternary mixtures (n-heptane/isooctane/toluene), as well as multicomponent mixtures that span the entire carbon
number range of gasoline fuels (C4(cid:1)C10). The increased use of oxygenated fuels (ethanol, butanol, MTBE, etc.) as blend-
ing components/additives has also motivated studies on their addition to gasoline fuels. This comprehensive review
presents the available experimental and chemical kinetic studies which have been performed to better understand
the combustion properties of gasoline fuels and their surrogates. Focus is on the development and use of surrogate
fuels that emulate real fuel properties governing the design and operation of engines. A detailed analysis is presented
for the various classes of compounds used in formulating gasoline surrogate fuels, including n-paraffins, isoparaffins,
olefins, naphthenes, and aromatics. Chemical kinetic models for individual molecules and mixtures of molecules to
emulate gasoline surrogate fuels are presented. Despite the recent progress in gasoline surrogate fuel combustion
research, there are still major gaps remaining; these are critically discussed, as well as their implications on fuel for-
mulation and engine design.

1. Introduction

PTransport is an essential part of modern society, accounting for
around 20% of the world's energy use [1]. Currently, about 95% of the
energy used for transport is provided by liquid fuels made by refin-
ing petroleum. Nearly 40% of global transport energy is used in pas-
senger cars, which are essentially (»80%) powered by spark ignition
(SI) engines running on gasoline [2]; although in Europe diesel
engines have a much larger share of the passenger car market. At
around 25 million barrels of oil equivalent [3], the daily global
demand for gasoline exceeds 4.8 billion liters.

PThe outlook for transport energy, the prime movers for change in
transport technology, alternatives to conventional engines and fuels
[4(cid:1)6], and implications for combustion science in these develop-
ments [7,8] have been discussed. There are many forces for change
in the transport sector, including increasing demand from a growing
and prosperous population, concerns about local and global emis-
sions, energy security and consumer demands and preferences. The
importance of each of these varies in different countries at different
times. Nevertheless, as in all energy sectors, efficiency is the primary
requirement for the engines that drive transport. Engine efficiency is
directly related to fuel economy and CO2 emissions. There is also
increasing pressure to minimize tailpipe emissions of unburned
hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx)
and particulate matter (PM). Nanoparticles are of particular concern
for public health.

PReconciling these often conflicting demands for the development
of future transport power systems is a tremendous challenge, one
which could be better met if new fuel/engine systems are co-opera-
tively developed. Reliable computational models that can predict
engine performance and emissions will be of great benefit to devel-
opment; such models will need to handle mixture formation, com-
bustion, and abnormal combustion, such as engine knock and
emissions, which limit efficiency. Fuel composition and properties
can affect performance and emissions in current engines [9] and
may be of greater importance in new combustion systems that use
fuel properties as an additional control parameter. However, practi-
cal fuels are mixtures of hundreds of hydrocarbons, and simplified
surrogate fuels are needed to represent them [10(cid:1)12] in computa-
tional models. Surrogate fuels contain a limited number of pure
components blended together to match a target practical fuel's com-
bustion and emission characteristics. It is currently impossible for a
single surrogate to represent all aspects of fuel behavior that are of
interest in engines, and different surrogates will be needed to model
different phenomena. For instance, the surrogate fuel to model

Pvaporization and mixture formation is likely to be quite different
from a surrogate to model autoignition behavior. However, as kinetic
models become available for more components and computational
resources increase in speed, future surrogates could reproduce all
real fuel characteristics.

PThe path towards cleaner burning and higher efficiency gasoline
engine technologies is illustrated in Fig. 1. This review focuses on
the development of surrogate fuels for gasoline, which is an integral
part of achieving the aforementioned goal. SI engines operate on
gasoline fuels comprising petroleum hydrocarbons obtained from
fossil resources. The chemical composition of gasoline varies with
time and location, so methods of characterizing important chemical
and physical properties are needed. Section 2 discusses target fuel
properties and strategies for the formulation of surrogate fuels.
When formulating surrogates, it is important to understand the rela-
tionship between specific fuel properties and engine performance (e.
g., efficiency and emissions), so these are also discussed in Section 2.
Once surrogates are formulated, fundamental combustion experi-
ments comparing them with their target gasoline fuels are useful for
refining the formulation and studying relationships between fuel
composition and combustion performance. Section 3 of this paper
covers fundamental combustion experiments on gasoline and surro-
gate fuels, including measurements of ignition delay time, laminar
flame speed, and product species formation. Simulating the combus-
tion of gasoline using surrogate fuel chemical kinetic models is
needed to perform computer-aided engineering and design. There-
fore, Section 4 of this paper focuses on chemical kinetic models
for gasoline surrogates and model validation against fundamental
combustion experiments. Such models are essential for predicting
various combustion phenomenon, such as knock in SI engines and
combustion in homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI)
engines. Section 5 provides concluding remarks and an outlook
towards future research in gasoline surrogate fuel development.

2. Surrogate fuel formulation

2.1. Defining target properties

PAn appropriate surrogate fuel mixture can accurately emulate
specific target properties of a gasoline fuel under investigation. A
surrogate that does not fall within standard gasoline specifications
would not be useful for studying fuel/engine interactions. The U.S.
standard specifications for SI engine fuels are given by ASTM D4814-
17, and properties vary depending on state and season [13]. Rand
and Verstuyft [14] provide a good reference for various fuel

Prelationship between the target property and combustion perfor-
mance must be considered. Target properties are classified into
physical and chemical properties. For example, physical properties,
such as fuel volatility, impact spray formation, which in turn influen-
ces combustion performance; chemical target properties such as
octane number impact the knock-limited operating conditions.

PThe selection of target properties is closely related to the engine
application in which the gasoline fuel is used. Although gasoline
fuels are used in both SI and CI engine applications, the combustion
process in each is significantly different. Even within a specific tech-
nology, combustion processes may change, depending on specific
engine operating conditions such as speed and load, or if abnormal
it is
conditions occur (e.g., pre-ignition, knock, etc.). Therefore,
important to determine which target properties should be matched
by a surrogate, and if all(cid:1)or possibly only a subset(cid:1)of target proper-
ties should be emulated.

PThis section presents a summary of important target properties
and explains their role in various combustion processes. Table 2
presents typical properties of gasoline fuels from various sources, as
well as the properties of some important additives (e.g., oxygenates).
Both physical and chemical (thermodynamic and chemical kinetic)
target properties will be discussed in the following sections. Finally,

Pstrategies for formulating surrogate mixtures by considering which
targets should be emulated are discussed.

2.2. Physical target properties

PThe physical properties of gasoline determine important engine-
related performance measures. A typical certificate of analysis for
gasoline fuel in North America and Europe provides details on spe-
cific gravity or density of the fuel at ambient conditions, vapor pres-
sure, and distillation profile, as shown in Table 2. Other important
physical properties include viscosity and surface tension, but these
are not typically provided in a certificate of analysis, so they should
be measured separately. Physical properties such as viscosity play a
more significant role in gasoline direct injection (GDI) technology,
where fuel sprays strongly impact in-cylinder combustion, as
opposed to port fuel injection (PFI).

P2.2.1. Overview of physical properties

PThe volatile characteristics of gasoline describe how easily the
fuel vaporizes under various conditions. Physical properties related
to volatility determine how liquid fuel droplets are converted to gas-
phase species, where the combustion process occurs. Volatility
characteristics strongly affect engine performance under various
weather conditions: cold winter conditions require a highly volatile
fuel to start the engine, while in summer lower volatility is desirable
to prevent emission of volatile organic compounds (VOC). Vapor
pressure and distillation profile are two important properties used
to measure volatility.

PFuel vapor pressure is exerted by the vapor under thermody-
namic equilibrium in the condensed liquid phase; it is an important
parameter governing fuel evaporation and affecting cold start, emis-
sions, and combustion efficiency. In the past, carbureted engines
could only be started with highly volatile fuels, but modern engines
with PFI or GDI do not have this requirement. The vapor pressure of
market gasoline varies depending on seasonal temperature condi-
tions. Lower volatility fuels are used at higher temperatures to mini-
mize vapor lock and fuel vapor emissions, while higher volatility is
desirable under colder conditions. Typical gasoline vapor pressure
ranges from 48(cid:1)103 kPa; it is measured in a closed chamber at
37.8 °C (310.95 K) and ambient pressure of one atmosphere
(101.325 kPa). In the U.S., dry vapor pressure equivalent (DVPE) is
typically measured by ASTM D5191 (the mini method), or ASTM

PD4953 (dry method) for gasoline-oxygenate blends, while in Europe
the DVPE is measured by EN 13016.

PThe distillation profile (or distillation curve) of gasoline measures
the amount of fuel distilled as the temperature varies. Hundreds of
hydrocarbon and oxygenated components, of different molecular
weight and molecular structure, are contained in gasoline. The boil-
ing points of the various hydrocarbons in the mixture varies, so the
gasoline mixture is distilled over a range of temperatures. Com-
pounds with lower boiling points are distilled first, higher boiling
point compounds distill later. This distillation profile impacts gaso-
line engine performance.

PThe front end of the distillation curve determines the initial vola-
tility of the mixture, which impacts cold start performance and
evaporative losses. Butane is typically added to gasoline under cold
weather conditions to help raise front end volatility. The mid-range
and tail-end of the distillation curve impacts acceleration, power
output, fuel economy, and unburned hydrocarbon emissions. The
distillation profile is measured by ASTM D86 methodology, in which
100 mL of fuel is heated in a flask at a controlled rate; as the fuel
evaporates, the gas passes through a condenser tube and the con-
densate is recovered. Temperature is measured by a thermocouple
placed above the sample liquid, so that it measures the gas-phase
temperature. The temperature corresponding to various volumes of
fuel recovered in the condensate is recorded (e.g., T at 10 vol% recov-
ered, T50, T90, etc.).

PA major drawback of the ASTM D86 methodology is that it does
not measure the temperature under thermodynamically vapor(cid:1)li-
quid equilibrium (VLE) conditions. The rate of heating and condensa-
tion, as well as the temperature measurement location, are subject
to significant uncertainty. This reduces experimental precision and
prevents the modeling of the experiment using thermodynamic
equations of state. To resolve these issues, Bruno et al. [29(cid:1)32]
developed the advanced distillation curve (ADC) method, which
measures true thermodynamic VLE state points with significantly
improved accuracy. The ADC method's improved ability to accu-
rately measure VLE conditions, compared to the ASTM D86 method,
makes it possible to numerically predict the fuel's distillation prop-
erties using a mixture model [33].

PFig. 2 shows an example of ADC measurements for six FACE
(Fuels for Advanced Combustion Engines), as measured by Burger
et al. [32]. Recently, Ferris and Rothamer [34] modified an ASTM D86
distillation apparatus to determine experimental equilibrium distil-
lation curves (EEDC). Fig. 3 from Ferris and Rothamer [34] shows
typical uncertainty resulting from traditional D86 measurements of
gasoline fuel, in which temperature measured in the vapor phase
(D86 vapor) is much lower than the equilibrium condition. Simply
measuring the liquid temperature in the sample (D86 Liquid) pro-
vides a much closer agreement to the equilibrium measurement
method (i.e. EEDC). These improved distillation methods are

PThe specific gravity and viscosity of gasoline fuels are important
physical properties that may impact fuel spray formation and
breakup processes. Specific gravity (the ratio of fuel density to water
density) is a dimensionless quantity. The density is measured by
ASTM D4052 in North America or EN 12185 in Europe. The typical
range of specific gravity in the ASTM D4814 or EN 228 specifications
is between 0.72 and 0.77, which is to ensure sufficient energy den-
sity. Viscosity requirements for gasoline fuels are not mentioned in
ASTM D4814 and EN 228 specifications for SI fuels, and measure-
ment and reporting of these values is not required. Gasoline viscosity
has less influence on spray processes in PFI and GDI engines due to
the use of hollow cone injectors with wide spray angles and rela-
tively low injection pressures.

P2.2.2. Relationship of physical properties to engine combustion
processes

PThe previous section highlighted several important physical prop-
erties of gasoline. It is necessary to understand how these properties
affect various engine combustion processes in order to know which
properties are important for a surrogate fuel to emulate. This section
summarizes recent literature relating various fuel physical properties
with engine combustion processes and performance measures.

PIt has been noted that volatility and distillation profile character-
istics affect engine cold-start performance and emissions. Volatility
primarily affects fuel evaporation rate, and thus, the air/fuel ratio in
the combustion chamber. The main processes affecting mixture
preparation in PFI SI engines are shown in Fig. 4 [38]. The processes
are extremely complex and include both droplet evaporation prior
to entering the combustion chambers and the entrainment of liquid
droplets into the bulk flow. Wall wetting by larger droplets imping-
ing on the inlet port or intake valve is also important. The dynamics
and evolution of these processes are controlled by their fuel volatil-
ity characteristics, temperature, engine design and operating condi-
tions. Skippon and Norton [38] investigated many of the effects of
gasoline volatility on engine performance. They showed that when
the engine is fully warmed up, all fuels are completely vaporized in
the inlet port, regardless of their T50 or T90. However, under cold
start conditions, only 20(cid:1)30% of the fuel is vaporized in the inlet
port, making wall wetting significant. T50 has a significant impact

tillation curves for a certification gasoline by Ferris and Rothamer [34]. Reproduced

Pbeneficial because they make it possible to simulate complex fluid
behavior using thermodynamic vapor-liquid equilibrium relations
[33,35].

PVapor pressure and distillation profile requirements for gasoline
fuels in automotive engines are specified according to ASTM D4814
in the U.S. market and EN 228 in the European market. Various cate-
gories, with their own ranges for vapor pressure and distillation pro-
file, are provided to meet various seasonal and performance
measure requirements. In the ASTM specification, vapor pressure
ranges from 54 kPa for Class AA gasoline to 103 kPa for Class E gaso-
line. T10, T50, and T90 for Class AA gasolines are 70 °C (343 K),
77(cid:1)121 °C (350(cid:1)394 K), and 190 °C (463 K), respectively. For Class E
gasolines, T10, T50, and T90 are 50 °C (32 K), 77(cid:1)110 °C
(350(cid:1)383 K), and 185 °C (458 K), respectively [36]. A recent study
by CONCAWE [37] showed that volatility requirements may be
relaxed with the introduction of modern engine hardware, such as
GDI technology, which reduces the effects of gasoline volatility on
regulated emissions and driveability.

Pon how much fuel is vaporized under cold-start conditions, while
the T90 is less relevant. However, as the engine warms up, T90
impacts vapor phase composition.

PA detailed study of PFI engines by Takei et al. [39] showed that
fuel volatility has a significant impact on HC emissions. Gasoline
fuels with a high T50 result in leaner air/fuel rations in the cylinder
due to poor vaporization of the fuel, causing lean misfiring and
increasing HC emissions. If the T50 is too low however, the air/fuel
ratio becomes rich and results in rich misfire and increased HC emis-
sions. Ryan and Matheaus [40], performed HCCI engine measure-
ments with gasolines of different volatilities. They showed that less
volatile fuels inhibit the fuel/air mixing process, so that perfectly
(cid:1)or even partially mixed(cid:1)fuel/air mixtures did not occur before the
start of reaction. Incomplete fuel evaporation in HCCI engines results
in fuel droplets that undergo diffusion combustion in the cylinder,
increasing both soot and NOx emissions. In principle, the high vola-
tility of gasoline-like fuels are desirable in HCCI and other compres-
sion ignition engine concepts, where sufficient premixing of fuel and
air is required prior to combustion [41(cid:1)47].

PIn GDI engines, the distribution of the fuel spray has a significant
impact on the in-cylinder combustion process due to the short time
available for fuel/air mixing. The effects of fuel volatility and engine
operating conditions on GDI fuel spray were investigated by VanDer-
Wege and Hochgreb [48]. Their experiments used planar laser-
induced fluorescence to image sprays ensuing from a pressure-swirl
fuel injector in an optically-accessible direct injection spark ignition
(DISI) engine. They showed that the higher volatility components in
multi-component fuel mixtures evaporate quickly when fuel tem-
perature is high, resulting in disruption of the spray structure and
formation of a vapor core within the spray core. Fuel volatility also
impacted spray penetration length and spray width.

PUsing Schlieren and Mie scattering techniques, Li et al. [49] also
studied the effects of fuel volatility on GDI spray characteristics at
high pressures and high temperatures. They tested two surrogate
fuel mixtures comprising various amounts of n-pentane, isooctane,
and n-decane, as well as a fully formulated gasoline fuel [49]. Their
results showed that higher fuel temperature increased evaporation
and decreased liquid and vapor penetration distances. Furthermore,
fuel mixtures with a larger fraction of heavier components had lower
volatility, and therefore lowered evaporation and increased liquid
and vapor penetration.

PDavy et al. [50] and Zigan et al. [51] showed that flash boiling
influenced by fuel composition and volatility characteristics affects
mean droplet diameter and mixture formation in DISI engines,
thereby affecting combustion and emissions. The volatility of gaso-
line alters with the addition of ethanol due to non-ideal mixing
behavior. Ethanol blending is known to cause higher volatility in
gasoline-ethanol mixtures, while also introducing discontinuities in
the distillation profile. Changes in T50 and T90 due to ethanol blend-
ing often motivate researchers to modify the gasoline blendstock by
adding higher boiling point hydrocarbons in order to remain within
ASTM D4814 limits. However, a recent study by Anderson et al. [52]
showed that studies which evaluate the effects of ethanol blending
on engine performance and emissions obscure the results, due to the
mixing of higher hydrocarbons; for this reason, such modifications
to the gasoline blendstock should be avoided.

PLow speed pre-ignition (LSPI) and superknock phenomena in GDI
engines has also been shown to be related to fuel volatility. One
common hypothesis is that LSPI is caused by fuel impinging on com-
bustion chamber walls, which interacts with oil on the liner and
results in oil(cid:1)fuel droplets detaching from the surface. These oil-
fuel droplets serve as reactive hot spots that result in pre-ignition.
Mayer et al. [53] showed that increasing fuel volatility significantly
reduces the tendency for pre-ignition. They explained that less vola-
tile fuels increase wall wetting and enter the piston crevice volume,
thereby enhancing the detachment of oil droplets by local fuel

Pdilution. Their experiments were further confirmed by proving that
HC emissions increase with decreasing fuel volatility, which also cor-
related with the pre-ignition tendency.

2.3. Chemical target properties

PChemical properties of gasoline affect the combustion process
because fuel/air oxidation is controlled by the fuel's molecular struc-
ture. As mentioned previously, gasoline is a complex mixture of hun-
dreds of hydrocarbons, as well as oxygenated additives. A gasoline
certificate of analysis typically provides information on fuel octane
numbers, carbon content, hydrogen content, oxygen content, H/C
ratio, aromatic content, olefinic content, and lower heating value
(LHV), all of which are determined by various ASTM or EN standard
methods. In addition to these typical chemical properties, more
detailed information on gasoline chemical composition can be
obtained by detailed hydrocarbon analysis (DHA), including the dis-
tribution of PIONA (paraffins, isoparaffins, olefins, naphthenes, aro-
matics), and even individual hydrocarbon structures. Laminar flame
speed is another chemically-related target property that is not typi-
cally reported for market fuels, but may be measured using various
methods.

PThe chemical composition of the fuel ultimately affects combus-
tion related target properties such as RON, MON, laminar flame
speed, and LHV. However, it is currently difficult to include the full
spectrum of hydrocarbons in a gasoline surrogate mixture, primarily
due to the present lack of chemical kinetic models for most species
(as discussed in Section 4). Nevertheless, it is plausible that as kinetic
models become available for hundreds of hydrocarbons, future gaso-
line surrogate mixtures would include a large number of compo-
nents that accurately emulate all properties of the target gasoline.

P2.3.1. Lower heating value

PThe LHV of gasoline is a gauge of its energy content, which is
measured as the heat produced by combusting a prescribed amount
of fuel in stoichiometric proportions with air under certain initial
temperature and pressure conditions. For this reason, LHV is also
commonly referred to as heat of combustion, and is directly related
to the chemical composition of the gasoline fuel. LHV is measured by
ASTM D240, using a bomb calorimeter, and is typically reported on a
mass basis, according to SI units (MJ/kg). On a mass basis, the LHV is
similar for fuels with similar molecular structure. For example, all
paraffinic hydrocarbons from C5 to C16 have LHV in the range of
»44(cid:1)46 MJ/kg, while aromatics have LHV near 40(cid:1)41 MJ/kg. This
relationship between molecular structure and LHV is shown in Fig. 5

P[54], in which the LHV is linearly proportional to the H/C ratio of a
complex real fuel mixture.

PGasoline fuels are typically sold on a per unit volume basis, so it is
often useful to understand the amount of energy per unit volume (e.
g., MJ/L). This has an impact on vehicle fuel economy, which is mea-
sured in units of L/100 km (or miles per gallon), because distance
travelled per unit of fuel is directly related to the volumetric energy
density of the fuel. Converting LHV to volumetric energy density
requires multiplying by the liquid density of the fuel, which varies
greatly with its molecular structure. Low molecular weight hydro-
carbons have lower liquid density, therefore their volumetric energy
density is notably lower than higher molecular weight hydrocar-
bons. The addition of oxygenates (e.g., ethanol) to gasoline decreases
LHV (mass basis) because fuel-bound oxygen does not burn to gener-
ate heat (i.e., oxygen has no heating value). Therefore, the volumetric
energy density of oxygenated fuels is also lower than pure hydrocar-
bon fuels, lowering oxygenated fuel economy. In general, the reduc-
tion in LHV is proportional to the mass percent of oxygen in the fuel.

P2.3.2. Gasoline chemical composition

POne important property of gasoline is its chemical composition,
which determines all subsequent chemical properties (octane num-
bers, H/C ratio, LHV, etc.) and physical properties (distillation curve,
density, etc.). The PIONA range of typical gasoline fuels is shown in
Fig. 6, along with representative molecular structures for each PIONA
class. Gasoline is distilled from crude oil, and the initial cut comprises
C4 to C10 n-paraffins, isoparaffins, naphthenes (cycloparaffins), and
aromatics. Various refinery processes are used to upgrade crude dis-
tillation products into fuels that meet gasoline specifications; these
processes include alkylation, catalytic condensation, isomerization,
and catalytic reforming [55], all of which are aimed at creating high-
octane quality molecules in the gasoline molecular weight range.

PNormal paraffins have the lowest octane quality of all gasoline
hydrocarbons, and are not typically found in large quantities in

Pmarket fuels. Iso-paraffins are generally found in larger quantities
due to their higher octane numbers. Paraffins range in carbon num-
bers from C4 to C8. Low molecular weight paraffins, such as n-
butanes and isobutanes, are blended into gasoline to meet front-end
distillation requirements for cold-start under winter conditions.
Other common paraffins include n- and isopentane and various iso-
mers of hexane, heptane, and octane with multiple methyl substitu-
tions. Octane number increases with the increased degree of methyl
substitutions [56,57], so higher molecular weight paraffins (C7(cid:1)(cid:1)C8)
in gasoline typically have one to three methyl substitutions. The
mixture of n- and isoparaffins is highly variable, and because of the
large number of possible isomeric species, no specific paraffinic
structure is present at more than a few percent. For example, the
widely used primary reference fuel surrogates, n-heptane and isooc-
tane, are only present in small quantities (less than 1%) in real gaso-
line fuels.

PThe naphthenic content of gasoline is limited to below 20 vol%,
since these compounds have low octane quality and are easily
converted to aromatics via reforming. Typical naphthenes found in
gasoline are in the C5 to C8 range, and include species such as cyclo-
pentane, cyclohexane, methyl cyclopentane, methyl cyclohexane,
and dimethyl cyclohexane isomers. Cyclopentane has the highest
octane number among the cycloalkanes.

POlefins (alkenes) are also found in limited quantities due to their
poor oxidative stability, which reduces the storage life of gasoline
fuels. Furthermore, olefins are often useful precursors for other value
added chemicals (e.g., polymers). Typical olefins range from C5 to C8
and include linear and branched pentene and hexene isomers. Due
to the presence of double bonds in the molecular structure, they
have high octane numbers; but they also display high octane sensi-
tivity.

PAromatics are the highest molecular-weight hydrocarbons in
gasoline fuels, falling in the C6 to C9 carbon number range. The end
of the gasoline distillation profile is typically comprised of high

Pmolecular weight alkylbenzenes. Aromatics have high octane num-
bers, but they are typically limited to below 30(cid:1)35 vol%, due to their
propensity to increase soot (particulate matter) emissions. Further-
more, benzene is a known carcinogen, so its concentration in gaso-
line is limited to below one vol%. For these reasons, the aromatic
hydrocarbons in gasoline fuel are limited to toluene, m-xylene, o-
xylene, (p-xylene is a valuable commodity chemical, not blended
into gasoline), ethylbenzene, and various trimethyl benzene isomers.
Toluene is the most predominant aromatic found in gasoline,
followed by the xylene isomers.

PIn addition to hydrocarbon components, gasoline fuels may also
contain various oxygenated additives. Traditionally, oxygenates
such as methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE), ethyl t-butyl ether (ETBE), t-
amyl methyl ether (TAME), diisopropyl ether (DIPE), methanol, etha-
nol, and t-butanol have been added to gasoline to improve its anti-
knock quality. The use of MTBE as an octane enhancer is prohibited
in North America, but many Asian countries still use it. Ethanol is by
far the most widely used oxygenate additive for gasoline fuels, and
may be blended up to 85 vol% (E85) into gasoline fuels; the most
commonly found blends contain ten vol% (E10) in North America
and five vol% (E5) in Europe. Recently, interest in renewable fuels
has motivated research on blending other oxygenates, such as prop-
anol and butanol isomers [59,60], pentanol isomers [61(cid:1)64], cyclic
oxygenates (e.g., furans and alkyl furans) [65(cid:1)67], aromatic oxygen-
ates and esters derived from levulinic acid (e.g., ethyl levulinate,
methyl levulinate, etc.) [68,69].

PThe exact chemical composition of gasoline fuels can be deter-
mined by ASTM D6730, which utilizes high resolution gas chroma-
tography (GC). This DHA test method determines the individual
hydrocarbon components in SI engine fuels, including mixtures con-
taining oxygenates, with boiling ranges up to 225 °C (498 K). The
D6730 method is accurate for mixtures containing up to 25 wt% ole-
fins, which makes it acceptable for most practical gasoline fuels.
However, mixtures containing higher olefin content, or olefins larger
than C7, require a separate multidimensional GC method (e.g., ASTM
D1319) to obtain accurate olefin percentages.

PA detailed analysis of individual components in gasoline fuels is
usually unavailable, or not required by ASTM standards. Typically,
gasoline suppliers only provide information on the aromatic, ole-
finic, oxygenate (ethanol or MTBE), carbon, hydrogen and oxygen
contents, and H/C ratio, as shown in Table 2. Normally, this informa-
tion, together with the octane rating, is sufficient to develop a surro-
gate fuel with a reasonable level of chemical fidelity. Carbon and
hydrogen content are important for determining the H/C ratio, and
these are measured using ASTM D5291 methodology. Oxygen con-
tent and the concentration of oxygenated additives are measured by
ASTM D4815, which is suitable for determining MTBE, ETBE, TAME,
DIPE, t-amyl alcohol, and C1 to C4 alcohols, and/or D5599 for other
oxygenates. The aromatic content is measured by ASTM D5580,
which utilizes gas chromatography to quantify benzene, toluene,
ethylbenzene, xylene isomers, and C9 and heavier aromatics. The
total olefinic content is measured by ASTM D6550, which is based on
supercritical-fluid chromatography.

P2.3.3. Gasoline anti-knock properties and octane number

PPerhaps the most important chemical property of gasoline fuel is
its antiknock quality, which is determined by the ability of the fuel/
air mixture to resist autoignition. Knock occurs because of autoigni-
tion of the unburned fuel/air mixture in the end-gas, ahead of the
advancing flame front in a SI engine; the presence of knock limits
engine efficiency [8,16]. The knocking tendency of a fuel/air mixture
depends on the pressure and temperature evolution with time and
on the anti-knock quality of the fuel. The anti-knock, or octane qual-
ity, is traditionally measured by the research and motor octane num-
bers, RON and MON. The MON test is run at 900 rpm with an intake
temperature of 149 °C; the RON test is run at an engine speed of

P600 rpm and an intake temperature of 52 °C in a single-cylinder CFR
engine. These tests are run using procedures set in ASTM D2699 for
RON and ASTM D2770 for MON. All practical fuels have RON higher
than MON, and the difference between RON and MON is known as
octane sensitivity (S).

PIf a target surrogate is intended to mimic only autoignition phas-
ing in engines running under premixed conditions (where different
fuels are subjected to the same pressure and temperature evolution),
it should match both RON and MON of the target gasoline. A toluene/
PRF (TPRF) mixture can be found to match any target RON and MON
[70], and chemical kinetic calculations on such a surrogate can pre-
dict knock onset in knocking engines [70,71]. However, TPRF surro-
gates for high octane sensitivity gasolines (e.g., above seven) have
toluene fractions which exceed 30%. Such surrogates with high
aromatic fractions do not accurately represent the hydrocarbon
distribution in practical gasoline fuels.

P2.3.4. Relationship of chemical properties to engine combustion
processes

PSeveral

important

chemical properties of gasoline were
highlighted in the previous sections. Chemical properties inherently
affect combustion processes in an engine because the molecular
structure impacts reactivity. However, it is necessary to ascertain
the importance of chemical properties on various engine processes
and to determine what level of chemical fidelity is needed for a sur-
rogate to emulate a real gasoline fuel. The following section summa-
rizes recent literature relating various fuel chemical properties to
engine combustion processes and performance measures. The
effects of fuel chemical properties on deposit formation are not dis-
cussed in detail as this is primarily related to fuel sulfur content, ole-
fin content, aromatic content, and presence of detergents [72,73].
Increasing fuel aromatic and olefin content has a statistically signifi-
cant effect on promoting deposit formation [74].

PThe efficiency, and hence CO2 emissions, of SI engines depends
strongly on octane requirements, which determine the knock lim-
ited operating range. Higher octane fuels enable earlier spark timing,
which can improve combustion efficiency and power output at
higher compression ratios. Di Iorio et al. [75] showed that blending
oxygenates, such as ethanol, MTBE, and ETBE, increase the octane
number, thereby improving combustion performance. This results in
decreased HC and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions, as well as lower
particulate matter emissions in oxygenated fuels due to the displac-
ing of aromatics [76(cid:1)78]. Machado et al. [79] conducted a careful
study of gasoline fuel composition on the SI engine calibration and
performance, with a specific focus on the relationship between
octane number and composition. The content of aromatics, n-paraf-
fins, and isoparaffins was varied in a gasoline base fuel containing
anhydrous ethanol, and the effect of each blending component on
engine combustion was assessed. The authors found that n-paraffins
are suitable blending components for engine conditions that are not
sensitive to knock because they permit higher stoichiometric fuel/
air ratios and higher H/C ratios, which increases combustion effi-
ciency and decreases fuel consumption. However, when the engine
is operated at conditions sensitive to knock, aromatics and isoparaf-
fins can be blended to produce a higher octane rating fuel. isoParaf-
fins are superior to aromatics due to their higher stoichiometric fuel/
air ratio and higher H/C ratios, which improves combustion effi-
ciency and reduces particulate matter emissions. The authors dem-
onstrated the need for flexible engine control systems that can
optimize engine performance based on the fuel used [79]. This fuel
blending concept has led to recent interest in octane-on-demand
(OOD) [80(cid:1)82], which offers the potential to vary fuel composition,
and hence its octane number, depending on the engine operating
requirements.

engine emissions. A comprehensive study by Hochhauser et al. [83]

Pinvestigated the effects of aromatic, olefin, and MTBE content on
vehicle emissions. It was shown that the addition of MTBE reduces
HC and CO emissions. It is well accepted that oxygenated additives,
such as ethers and alcohols [60,84], improve combustion efficiency,
thereby reducing particulate matter (i.e., soot), HC, CO emissions. In
modern vehicles, increasing the aromatic content increases hydro-
carbon and particulate emissions [78] while lowering oxides of
nitrogen (NOx). However, the addition of oxygenated aromatics (e.g.,
2-phenylethanol, anisole, etc.) can improve the soot-NOx tradeoff
[85(cid:1)87]. Increasing olefin content corresponds to lower NOx emis-
sions and higher hydrocarbon emissions [83,88].

PModern DISI engines are shown to be sensitive to fuel composi-
tion and antiknock quality. As mentioned previously, modern DISI
engines have negative K values [89], so fuels with lower MON values
(i.e., higher S) extend the knock-limited operating range. Davies
et al. [90] studied the fuel effects on DISI combustion with a focus on
octane appetite; they showed that higher sensitivity fuels (high RON
and low MON) perform better in modern engines. Furthermore, high
sensitivity fuels were shown to have higher burning velocity,
thereby improving fuel efficiency and cyclic variability. They also
noted that higher burning velocity fuels may be more prone to preig-
nition, and hence superknock [90].

PMachado et al. [91] showed that various TPRF (toluene/n-hep-
tane/isooctane) surrogate mixtures, each blended with 25 vol% etha-
nol, behaved differently in a multi-cylinder DISI engine due to
variations in their antiknock index (AKI) values and stoichiometric
A/F ratios. A reference gasoline with an AKI of 89.2 was tested along-
side ten different surrogates at a range of speed and load operating
points. Their results showed that TPRF/ethanol mixtures with AKI
values and stoichiometric A/F ratios close to the reference gasoline
could match engine torque, fuel consumption, and specific fuel con-
sumption across the entire operating range.

PA recent study by Ahmed et al. [92] assessed the impact of gaso-
line chemical properties and composition of DISI engine combustion,
performance, and emissions. The study was unique in that two well-
characterized non-oxygenated gasolines with similar AKI, but vary-
ing S, were experimentally investigated at various load points and
spark timings with early injection timings. The goal was to deter-
mine whether fuels with similar knocking characteristics in a stan-
dard cooperative fuel research (CFR) engine (i.e., similar AKI) behave
differently in DISI engines. The authors showed that gasoline with
higher aromatic content resulted in higher hydrocarbon and soot
emissions [92]. Interestingly, they also noted that if the fuel octane
number is held constant, a gasoline fuel with lower heat capacity (e.
g., constant pressure, Cp) will result in higher end-gas temperatures,
making it more prone to knock. Furthermore, the fuel burn duration
was found to be dependent on fuel composition (e.g., H/C ratio), as
well as thermodynamic properties of the fuel, which affect in-cylin-
der temperature and pressure. Thus, in DISI engines heat capacity is
an important chemical property to consider during surrogate fuel
formulation, as this determines the conditions at which combustion
occurs.

PThe previous discussion focused on the impact of gasoline chemi-
cal properties on SI engine combustion and emissions. However, gas-
oline-like fuels may also be utilized in low temperature combustion
(LTC) engine strategies such as HCCI, PCCI, etc. The combustion pro-
cess in LTC engines is notably different, and therefore fuel chemical
properties have different effects than in SI engines. Most notably, to
obtain the desired onset of heat release and combustion phasing, an
appropriate ignition quality is required in HCCI engines. An ignition
quality metric for HCCI engines has received attention in the litera-
ture [8,40,93,94], and is naturally linked to the chemical properties
of the fuel. In PCCI and PPC engines, where fuel is injected late in the
cycle to achieve stratification, both fuel chemical properties (e.g.,
ignition quality) and physical properties (e.g., spray formation,
vaporization, etc.) are important.

PShibata et al. [93] proved that the evolution of low temperature
heat release (LTHR) plays a critical role in operation of HCCI engines.
Paraffinic fuels were shown to have appreciable LTHR, while aro-
matics did not display LTHR behavior. Olefins and naphthenes
(cycloalkanes) display minor LTHR but behave more like LTHR inhib-
itors than LTHR promoters, when compared to paraffins. The authors
linked a fuel's measured HCCI engine high temperature heat release
(HTHR) characteristics to its conventional RON and MON metrics,
obtained in an SI engine. They showed that RON correlates with the
HTHR characteristics under engine conditions when the fuel com-
bustion displays minor LTHR characteristics. However, MON was
shown to correlate with HTHR characteristics under conditions
without LTHR [93].

PThe effect of fuel composition on HCCI engine combustion was
investigated by Truedsson et al. [95,96] by investigating various PRF
mixtures and mixtures of n-heptane, isooctane, toluene, and ethanol.
Their aim was to develop an HCCI autoignition index to rank fuels,
similar to the RON and MON metric for SI engines. The autoignition
temperature and magnitude of LTHR were identified as relevant
metrics of ranking ignition quality of fuels in HCCI engines. The
authors demonstrated that
increasing n-heptane concentration
increases LTHR and decreases AIT, while toluene increases AIT and
acts as an LTHR inhibitor. Ethanol was also shown to increase the
AIT and suppress LTHR. These findings indicate that chemical com-
position (e.g., paraffin, aromatic, alcohol) has similar qualitative
effects in HCCI engine autoignition and SI engine knock. However,
quantitatively, the HCCI ranking of fuel autoignition is not directly
correlated with SI engine RON and MON ratings. This indicates that
the effect of chemical composition depends strongly on engine oper-
ating conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, and equivalence ratio).
PTo further understand fuel composition effects on autoignition
quality, Lacey et al. [94] studied the effects of refinery stream gaso-
line blends in an HCCI engine. They tested 17 gasoline fuels with eth-
anol content ranging from 0% to 100%, and mixtures with various
amounts of aromatics, olefins, and saturates (paraffins/isoparaffins).
A broad range of RON, MON, and S were captured in the blends. They
showed that HCCI combustion phasing is strongly dependent on the
RON and MON of the fuel, as well as its composition (i.e., fraction of
aromatics, olefins, saturates, and ethanol). They defined a revised
form of the octane index (i.e., OIJKZ, where JKZ denotes the authors’
initials [94]) to describe fuel ignition characteristics under various
engine conditions. The OIJKZ D RON - K’ *S C k*(aromatics)2*(olefins
C saturates) C e(cid:3)(aromatics*ethanol), where K’, k, and e, are con-
stants that depend on engine operating conditions [94]. The authors
showed that OIJKZ, which depends on fuel composition, can accu-
rately describe ignition characteristics of fuel in an HCCI engine.

PThe effects of fuel composition on HCCI engine emissions were
also tested by Truedsson et al. [97] with a specific focus on NOx, CO,
and HC emissions. In general, emissions are low in HCCI applica-
tions; nevertheless, higher RON PRF mixtures were shown to yield
greater NOx emissions because of the higher in-cylinder tempera-
tures achieved. Adding ethanol or toluene to a high octane mixture
reduced NOx emissions.
Increasing the PRF octane number
decreased HC emissions, due to higher in-cylinder temperature and
less fuel trapped in the crevices. The addition of toluene was found
to increase HC emissions, while ethanol reduced HC emissions by
promoting fuel oxidation. CO emissions were not found to be
directly linked to fuel composition, rather, in-cylinder temperature
inhomogeneity (leading to cold spots) was found to be the primary
reason why CO was not being oxidized to CO2.

PThe importance of fuel chemical properties in LTC engines
depends on injection timing. In HCCI combustion, fuel is injected
very early, with plenty of time to vaporize and mix before burning;
therefore, the combustion process is primarily determined by fuel
chemical properties. In PCCI or PPC operating modes, the fuel is
injected late in the cycle, so there is less time for fuel vaporization

Pand mixing. As a result, the combustion process is affected by both
chemical and physical properties. Aronsson et al. [98] investigated
the effect of fuel properties on LTHR in HCCI and PPC engines. They
showed that increasing isooctane concentration increased LTHR in
the PPC mode, while decreasing LTHR in the HCCI mode. Ethanol and
toluene additions increased the fraction of LTHR when operating
under the PPC mode, but it decreased LTHR under HCCI combustion
operating conditions. Their results showed that fuel chemical prop-
erties strongly impact HCCI engine operation, but are less important
at later injection times, corresponding to PPC.

PThe previous section on physical properties discussed the effect
of volatility on LSPI in DISI engines. Chemical properties can also
impact LSPI because they impact the fuel octane rating and burning
rate. Amann et al. [99] investigated fuel composition effects on LSPI
in high performance SI engines. Four fuels with varying aromatic
and oxygenate (ethanol) content, but similar RON, MON, and AKI,
were tested. They discovered that fuel composition strongly affects
the frequency and magnitude of LSPI. Increasing the level of aro-
matics was found to increase LSPI frequency, while increasing oxy-
genate content and decreasing aromatic content decreased LSPI
frequency. Unexpectedly, they also showed that-despite having sim-
ilar RON and MON as the other test fuels-low aromatic gasoline
showed an increased propensity for conventional end-gas knock/
autoignition in the DISI engine. This was attributed to the low aro-
matic gasoline displaying LTHR prior to the main heat release event.

2.4. Surrogate formulation strategies/methodologies

PTo this point, discussion has focused on important physical and
chemical properties of gasoline fuels and their impact on engine
combustion processes. A surrogate fuel mixture, comprising a lim-
ited number of components, can be formulated to match various
physical and chemical target properties of the real gasoline fuel. This
section described various approaches for formulating gasoline surro-
gate fuels. The methodology of formulation for surrogates of diesel
and aviation fuels is also relevant to the present study, as the general
approach is similar. The reader is referred to notable works on for-
mulation of diesel and aviation fuel surrogates [12,33,67,100(cid:1)107]

PThe target properties to be matched, and their link to the engine
combustion processes to be replicated by the surrogate, are the first
issues to be addressed. For example, if only spray droplet formation
and vaporization are to be captured, a surrogate that matches a lim-
ited set of physical properties of the real fuel may be sufficient,
neglecting any chemical properties as targets. The most important
property to be replicated for gasoline fuels is autoignition behavior;
this is true for both SI and CI engines operating on gasoline-like fuels.
To predict autoignition phasing (if the P/T trajectory with time is
the same as followed by the gasoline), the RON and MON of the sur-
rogate should be the same as that of the gasoline. A toluene, heptane,
isooctane mixture can always be found to match a given RON and
MON. Other properties to match with those of the gasoline, such as
carbon/hydrogen ratios, have also been suggested [10], although the
importance or actual necessity of doing so has not been demon-
strated in engine tests. Physical properties such as volatility, viscos-
ity and heat of vaporization must be replicated if the surrogate is to
model spray and mixture formation, e.g., in gasoline compression
ignition (GCI) engines. Knowledge of laminar burning velocity could
be useful in judging the possibility of pre-ignition; it could also be
useful for predicting flame development rates in SI engines. Fuel
effects on flame development, though likely to be small, might be of
interest as engine designers seek ever greater efficiency. However,
this will require additional information about turbulence in the
engine and its effect on the laminar flame.

PObviously, the surrogate will become more complex, since it has
more properties to match. In fact, it is probably not possible to match
both physical and chemical properties fully and maintain the

Pcomplexity of the surrogate at a manageable level. Ultimately, it is a
matter of judgement. Equally important is that the accuracy of any
computational prediction will also depend on the computational
model used. Even if the surrogate matches the gasoline properties
well; if the computational model(cid:1)for example, chemical kinetics or
mixing(cid:1)is not adequate, then the predictions of the model will not
be accurate. Also, the complexity of the surrogate (for chemical
kinetics for instance) will also affect the complexity of the chemical
kinetic model and detract from its usefulness. In GCI combustion for
example, the focus might be to design a complementary mix for
complex spray and turbulent flow models; a simple kinetic model
with chemistry for a small number of surrogate components is
needed to integrate with the flow models.

PPitz et al. [10] stated that gasoline surrogates should be formu-
lated to match the target real fuel properties and HCCI engine perfor-
mance characteristics; the important fuel property targets are LHV
and H/C ratio. LHV should be matched withinC/¡ 5% of the reference
gasoline so that fuel flow to the engine is similar, in order to main-
tain a similar fuel energy input. Real gasoline fuels have H/C ratios
between 1.6 and 2.0, therefore surrogate fuel mixtures should be in
the same range. Targeting the H/C ratio is important because air/fuel
ratio depends on this value. If the H/C ratio is well matched by a sur-
rogate fuel, then air flow to the engine will be similar between the
real gasoline fuel and its surrogate. The important engine properties
to match are combustion phasing of 10% mass fraction burned
(CA10) and 50% mass fraction burned (CA50). The CA10 is normally
related to the onset and magnitude of LTHR; a surrogate that
matches the CA10 of a target gasoline fuel essentially matches its
low temperature chemical reactivity. CA50 is the most important
combustion parameter in an HCCI engine because it ultimately
determines engine performance and emissions. A surrogate mixture
that matches the RON and MON of a target gasoline will have the
same CA50 in an HCCI engine [108,109].

PA general methodology for gasoline surrogate fuel formulation
for HCCI engines was presented by Puduppakkam et al. [110]. First, a
palette of surrogate fuel components was selected, which contained
molecules representative of the various chemical class in real gaso-
line fuels. The surrogate components were then blended in propor-
tions needed to match various target properties of the real fuel,
keeping combustion targets in mind. If combustion simulations
were to be performed, then chemical kinetic models needed to be
assembled for the surrogate fuel components. The authors outlined
target properties that should be matched, including the molecular
structure, distillation curve, octane numbers, LHV, and H/C ratio.
Matching the molecular composition helped to match various physi-
cal properties of the fuel. Matching several points along the distilla-
tion curve (e.g., T10, T50, T90) ensured that the surrogate matched
the spray characteristics of the real gasoline. As noted previously,
matching octane numbers is necessary to capture the combustion
phasing and knocking characteristics. LHV determines the cumula-
tive heat release upon combustion, while the H/C ratio determines
emission characteristics, so these properties should be matched in a
surrogate fuel. Puduppakkam et al. [110] outlined a computational
methodology (Fig. 7), to formulate a surrogate that matched defined
target properties. The methodology minimizes an objective function
to optimize a surrogate formulation that matched distillation curve,
LHV, H/C ratio, RON, and MON value. The methodology is flexible in
that various targets properties may be included or removed (e.g.,
O/C ratio may be added for oxygenated fuels).

PSu et al. [111] outlined a similar approach for the development of
surrogate fuels for transportation fuels, including gasoline. The tar-
get properties of interest included physical properties, such as den-
sity, LHV, volatility, and viscosity, and chemical properties, such as
H/C ratio and ignition quality (i.e., RON). They used an optimization
algorithm to determine the surrogate mixtures that best matched
the target properties. Each target property was also given a weighing

PIn summary, this section offers a general outline for formulation
of a surrogate mixture to match a gasoline fuel of interest. It is
imperative to first determine which physical and chemical properties
should be chosen as target properties, as well as their relationship to
the combustion technology and the operating conditions of interest.
Once the target gasoline properties are selected, a surrogate fuel can
be formulated from a mixture of palette components. The optimal
mixture of components is best determined using a computational
algorithm that assigns a weight to each target property and then sol-
ves an objective function to minimize the error against all the target
properties. Subsequent sections will discuss experimental and
computational studies performed on gasoline surrogate mixtures and
relate them to investigations performed on real gasoline fuels.

3. Fundamental combustion experiments on gasoline and
surrogate fuels

PGasoline fuels are primarily used in spark ignition engines and in
advanced low-temperature combustion counterparts. Fuel combus-
tion in internal combustion engines is complex and may comprise
fuel injection, spray, vaporization, fuel(cid:1)air mixing, heat and mass
transfer, ignition and combustion. Targeted engine experiments may
be carried out on real gasoline and proposed surrogate mixtures to
assess how well the surrogate captures real fuel behavior, such as
heat release rate, combustion phasing and emissions. Such experi-
ments are typically performed at selected engine operating condi-
tions, and therefore, may not cover the entire spectrum of practical
scenarios to which the fuel will be subjected. Also, depending on the
engine operating mode, the observed trends may be affected by
physical as well as chemical properties of the real fuel and surrogate
mixture. Lastly, engine experimental data cannot be directly used to
develop and validate detailed chemical and physical models for the
surrogate mixtures.

PFundamental combustion experiments carried out

in well-
designed chemical reactors and/or canonical flames may provide
valuable data that can be used to (i) understand trends and compari-
sons among various fuels and fuel surrogates, (ii) build detailed
chemical models to propose optimal surrogates, and (iii) describe
fuel behavior over wide ranges of engine operating conditions. Such
fundamental experiments may be able to decouple the physical and
chemical aspects of fuel behavior and are ideal for understanding the
effects of the chemical structure on fuel autoignition and emissions,
for example. When the focus is solely on fuel chemistry, the experi-
ments are designed so that chemical kinetic processes govern the
fuel oxidation, while physical/mixing processes play a negligible role.
PThere are two key goals in performing and presenting fundamen-
tal combustion experiments on gasolines and surrogates: (a) to
demonstrate, in well-controlled experimental conditions, that the
surrogate matches the combustion behavior of the target gasoline,
and (b) to provide data that can be used to develop and validate
detailed chemical kinetic models of gasoline surrogates. If a surrogate
successfully emulates, for example, the autoignition behavior of real
fuel in a shock tube (ST) and a rapid compression machine (RCM),
will such a surrogate also reproduce the knock timing or heat release
rate of real fuel in an engine? The answer rests on two important
points: the experimental conditions tested in ST / RCM must overlap
with the engine operating conditions, and the ignition process in the
engine must be dominated by fuel chemistry. In the first consider-
ation, the temperatures (500(cid:1)2000 K), pressures (1(cid:1)60 bar) and
equivalence ratios (0.2(cid:1) 4) covered in modern ST / RCM facilities do
overlap appreciably with engine operating conditions. Secondly, the
ignition process in HCCI engines, for example, is indeed dominated
by fuel chemistry [127]. Likewise, the knock timing in SI engines is
predominantly controlled by the autoignition behavior of the end
gas, as illustrated in a recent review paper by Zhi et al. [128].

Pfactor to quantify its importance, as well as error tolerances for con-
vergence checking. The methodology was used to formulate a surro-
gate that accurately reproduced the combustion behavior of a target
fuel under LTC engine conditions.

PA unique approach to gasoline surrogate formulation was pre-
sented by Mehl et al. at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
[112]. Like the previous approaches, a palette of surrogate species
was first defined, together with target properties to be matched. The
target properties included gasoline paraffin content, aromatic con-
tent, olefin content, H/C ratio, RON, and MON. The authors presented
a novel methodology to determine the RON and MON for a proposed
surrogate mixture. The methodology performed chemical kinetic
simulations under homogeneous batch reactor conditions to predict
the ignition delay time of a surrogate mixture. A mapping of ignition
delay times for various mixtures with known RON and MON was
then utilized to determine the RON and MON of the proposed surro-
gate mixture [112]. This methodology for predicting RON and MON
is accurate, but it requires high fidelity chemical kinetic models.
Badra et al. [113] demonstrated that ignition delay time simulations
which considered the actual volume-time history of the fuel/air mix-
ture in the CFR engine could better predict measured RON and MON
values of toluene/n-heptane/isooctane surrogate mixtures.

PA common theme in surrogate formulation methodologies is the
attempt to match multiple target properties with a combination of
species in a palette. This requires predicting, without actually mea-
suring, the properties of various candidate surrogate mixtures to
find one that best matches the properties of the target fuel. Pera and
Knop [114,115] showed that H/C ratio, O/C ratio, LHV, molecular
weight, RON, and MON could be calculated using simple linear molar
blending rules. Morgan et al. [116] showed that non-linear blending
rules more accurately predict RON and MON, and similar results
have also been shown for ethanol blending with gasoline surrogates
[117,118]. Physical properties, such as volatility characteristics (i.e.,
distillation curve), are more difficult to estimate because they are
not additive. Slavinskaya et al. [119] and Huber et al. [33] have
shown that the distillation characteristics of mixtures requires cal-
culating vapor-liquid equilibrium. This can be achieved by selecting
an appropriate equation of state and mixing rules for estimating the
properties of mixtures. Similar thermo-transport models [120(cid:1)124]
have been shown to be useful for predicting gasoline droplet heating
and evaporation characteristics and formulating surrogates. Ahmed
et al. [125] and Abianeh et al. [126] later demonstrated that various
estimation methods for target properties could be introduced into
an optimization algorithm that formulates a surrogate capable of
matching multiple target properties with a minimum of error.

PResearchers have developed and used a variety of fundamental
experiments to understand the combustion chemistry of various
fuels. Each reactor/experiment provides data on specific aspects of
the chemical kinetic behavior of the fuel, and each experimental
apparatus has its sweet spots and its limitations. Therefore, data
obtained from the so-called ideal reactors should not be universally
categorized as ideal, and care must be exercised in using these data
for building chemical kinetic models and for understanding fuel
chemistry.

PBefore the literature data on gasoline and gasoline surrogates is
presented, it is important to briefly describe the advantages and
challenges associated with various kinds of fundamental devices in
which these data are obtained. Specifically, the additional complexi-
ties faced when working with distillate fuels and fuel mixtures will
be discussed and compared to single-component fuels.

3.1. Challenges of gasoline measurements

P3.1.1. Ignition measurements in shock tubes

PFuel autoignition quality is critical in determining the operating
regime of SI engines. This is typically measured in terms of the
research and motor octane numbers (RON, MON), with the help of
ASTM standard tests carried out in CFR engines. These octane num-
bers cannot be directly used to build or validate chemical kinetic
models; however, it has previously been shown [112] that homoge-
neous ignition delay times may be correlated with the octane rat-
ings. As an illustration of this relationship, Fig. 8 [113] plots ignition
delay times as a function of RON and MON of a number of three-
component TPRF (n-heptane / isooctane / toluene) fuels. It can be
clearly seen that there is a strong correlation between RON/MON
and homogeneous ignition delay times at the specific conditions
chosen carefully by Mehl et al. [112].

PThe homogeneous ignition delay time (also known as the induc-
tion time) is defined as the time it takes for a homogeneous fuel/air

Fig. 8. Calculated ignition delay times for stoichiometric TPRF/air mixtures versus
RON and MON at (a) 835 K and 20 bar, (b) 825 K and 20 bar. Figure adapted from

Pmixture at a specific temperature and pressure to explode, resulting
in rapid increase of temperature/pressure and heat release. Although
ignition delay time is a global indicator of fuel oxidation behavior, it
is strongly influenced by the underlying elementary reactions, and
thus it provides a very stringent target for kinetic model develop-
ment and validation.

PThe shock tube stands as the ideal homogeneous batch reactor for
measuring ignition delay times as a function of temperature, pres-
sure and mixture fraction. A shock wave heats and pressurizes the
fuel/air mixture almost instantly and the environment behind the
reflected shock wave is adequately modeled as a zero-dimensional
(homogeneous) reactor. Shock tubes have historically been used to
measure high temperature ignition delay times, which tend to be of
the order of a few microseconds to a couple of milliseconds. Over
these times, the shock tubes behave almost ideally where the pres-
sure behind the reflected shock waves remains nearly constant.

PSome of the challenges encountered during the measurement of

ignition delay times of gasoline fuels are examined here briefly.

Pa) Long ignition delay times: Most commercial gasolines have rela-
tively high RON (91(cid:1)97), and boosted engines are expected to
utilize fuels with even higher octane ratings. The addition of eth-
anol and use of knock inhibitors (e.g., MTBE) results in high
octane gasolines with relatively long ignition delay times, par-
ticularly at low temperatures and in the NTC region. It is very
important to characterize the fuel reactivity at low temperatures
and NTC to accurately describe the LTHR and ITHR, which are
critical in the design of modern low-temperature combustion
(LTC) engines.

P Typically, shock tubes were used to measure only high tempera-
ture ignition delays, as accessible test times were limited to
< 2 ms. Recently however, longer driver sections and driver gas
tailoring have enabled much longer test times [2]. Although the
driver gas tailoring theory is well-established [129], in practice,
achieving long test times requires considerable effort and exper-
imentation. Additionally, the gradual increase of pressure (dP/
dt) behind reflected shock waves becomes significant when
measuring long ignition delay times, particularly for small diam-
eter shock tubes. It is very important to carefully characterize
the dP/dt for each shock tube and provide the value for the spe-
cific experiments being reported. It should also be noted that
dP/dt might not be the same for tailored and non-tailored
experiments. Fig. 9 shows that long test times may be achieved
by adding N2 or CO2 to He in the driver section of the shock
tube. Sometimes a buffer gas [4] must be added between the
driver and driven gases to avoid pressure bumps at the contact
surface. Varying compositions of driver gases and buffer gas are
needed for specific test times and temperatures. It can be very
difficult to avoid over- or under-tailoring, as demonstrated in
Fig. 9b, by the contact surface expansion.

P Finally, it has recently been observed that shock tube ignition
delay data might be affected by pre-ignition and flame propaga-
tion over long test times [130]. Fig. 10 shows various ignition
types observed for low temperature oxidation of n-hexane and
n-heptane. The intermediate temperature cases (Fig. 10b) show
a marked, gradual rise of pressure, reminiscent of flame propa-
gation, before the main ignition event. Such pre-ignition energy
release can artificially shorten the otherwise homogeneous igni-
tion delay times; therefore, care must be exercised in using long
ignition delay shock tube data which might be shortened by
non-ideal effects such as the dP/dt and the pre-ignition.

Pb) Fuel vaporization: Since gasoline fuel is comprised of hundreds of
compounds with varying boiling points, it is important to have
an efficient strategy for fuel vaporization. The liquid fuel should
be injected into a heated chamber, such as a mixing vessel,
where the temperature of the vessel is high enough to ensure

Pvaporization of all gasoline components. Depending on the high
carbon content of the gasoline and aromatic fraction, a vessel
temperature in the range of 80(cid:1)150 C might suffice. Fuel vapori-
zation may be verified by sampling fuel from the mixing vessel
and comparing the GC (gas chromatograph) spectrum with that
of the liquid fuel. At these high mixing temperatures, there is a
small but finite likelihood that some fuel components could
undergo decomposition. This can also be checked by sampling
the fuel mixture from the mixing vessel at varying residence
times. Lastly, the heavy fuel components could condense if there
are any cold spots within the mixing vessel or mixing manifold,
or the (usually long) line connecting the vessel with the shock
tube driven section. Some molecules can also adsorb to metallic
surfaces. Passivating the vessel and shock tube walls with the
fuel can help reduce adsorption losses. Fuel loss by condensation
or adsorption may be quantified either with a laser absorption
diagnostic (e.g., using a 3.39 mm HeNe laser in the shock tube),
or by sampling the fuel mixture from the shock tube and run-
ning GC or FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer) tests.
Pc) Thermodynamic properties: The calculation of reflected shock
temperature and pressure necessitates the measurement of inci-
dent shock velocity and knowledge of the thermodynamic prop-
erties of the fuel mixture. This requires knowing the detailed
composition (DHA: detailed hydrocarbon analysis) of the gaso-
line. Thereafter, a thermodynamic surrogate that mimics the
thermal properties of the gasoline can be set up.

Pd) Compositional changes: It is well known that gasoline fuels may
undergo compositional changes if stored for long periods and/
or improperly stored. For example,
if the container is not
sealed well, some of the lighter components may evaporate.
Over a long storage period, oxygen reactions in the head space

Pof the storage container may also degrade the gasoline. When-
ever possible, it is best to store the fuel in refrigerated condi-
tions. Compositional analysis of the fuel should be performed
at the time of procurement/production and at the time of
experimental usage to determine if there have been changes to
the composition.

P3.1.2. Ignition measurements in rapid compression machines

PRapid compression machines (RCMs) are generally used to mea-
sure long ignition delay times which are not accessible by shock
tubes. This is particularly important for high octane gasolines where
ignition delay times may exceed 5 ms for initial temperatures lower
than »900 K for initial pressures ranging 10(cid:1)20 bar. Therefore, to
effectively study the fuel NTC behavior, the RCM ignition delay data
play a critical role. Also, the differences among various fuels are
amplified in the NTC and low-temperature regions.

PThe challenges encountered in RCM measurements of gasoline
ignition delay times are very similar to those mentioned for shock
tubes. Some additional considerations are as follows:

Pa) As a general rule, it is not advisable to use RCMs for measuring
ignition delay times less than »5 ms. This is because, for such
relatively short ignition delay times, considerable chemical reac-
tions occur during the piston compression phase. Although the
compression stroke can be modeled during reactive simulations,
as illustrated in Fig. 11, assigning a specific initial temperature
to such ignition delay experiments becomes ambiguous.

Pb) Fuel adsorption could be a bigger concern in RCM experiments
as the combustion chamber has relatively high surface-to-vol-
ume ratio. Therefore, sampling of the fuel mixture from the RCM

than is

Pd) For RCM experiments, EOC temperatures can be varied by
changing the initial temperature and/or the composition of the
bath gas by mixing N2 with Ar or CO2. Variation in bath gas com-
position may affect third body reaction rates, which should be
modeled carefully while simulating RCM experiments.

Pe) Due to the long test times accessible with RCMs, it is possible to
differentiate various fuels in the NTC and low-temperature
regions. However, it should be considered that ignition can
potentially start in the cold boundary layer, particularly when
measuring ignition delay times in the NTC region. This behavior
may be detected by analyzing the pressure traces carefully for
evidence of pre-ignition and flame propagation prior to the bulk
homogeneous ignition.

Pf) Heat transfer losses in rapid compression machines are modeled
by employing a varying volume time-history derived from non-
reactive pressure trace measurement. This approach works rea-
sonably well for single stage ignition. For two-stage ignition
phenomenon, heat release during the first stage may alter the

Pover-estimation of burning velocities, particularly for rich mix-
tures. On the other hand, over-heating of the fuel stream, or hot
spots, can lead to premature fuel decomposition, especially for
large molecules.

Pb) Liquid fuels are usually introduced via syringe pumps, or liquid
flow regulators, which must be properly calibrated and should
have dependable accuracy to avoid serious uncertainties in the
equivalence ratio. This is usually not an issue for gaseous fuels
as the mass flow controllers tend to be of greater accuracy.

Pc) For stagnation flames, such as the counterflow configuration,
discrepancies exist in the extrapolation of measured flame
speed to zero strain rate (K) using either linear or non-linear
extrapolation methods (these uncertainties tend to be bigger for
larger molecules relevant to gasoline surrogates [136]). These
issues arise from differential diffusion effects for mixtures of
large molecular weight fuels, particularly under rich conditions.
Pd) For spherically expanding flames, partial pressure methodology
is used to fill the chamber for each experimental run. It is very
important that pressure transducers of appropriate range are
used and that these transducers are well-calibrated. For multi-
component liquid fuels, as discussed earlier, the heating and
vaporization requirements can be quite stringent and care must
be taken to avoid hot/cold spots. It may also be advisable to sam-
ple the reactant mixture and confirm the composition by GC/MS
techniques. Finally, issues similar to the extrapolation complexi-
ties in stagnation flames also affect data interpretation from
spherically expanding flames.

Pe) The heat-flux method provides an advantage in that the flame
speed is obtained via interpolation rather than extrapolation.
However, this method is also affected by several uncertainties
such as boundary conditions at the burner surface, flame insta-
bility, flame-wall interactions leading to loss of radicals, temper-
ature and flow velocity measurements.

P3.1.4. Speciation with jet-stirred reactors and low-pressure flames

PA jet-stirred reactor (JSR) and/or low-pressure flame, coupled
with GC(cid:1)MS, FTIR or TOF-MS may be used to measure intermediate
species and products of fuel oxidation. Such speciation data are use-
ful for validating the detailed chemistry of the surrogate models
being developed for the gasoline. Recently, there have been wide-
ranging studies utilizing synchrotron-based vacuum ultraviolet (UV)
photon ionization; this methodology has resulted in a wealth of
valuable speciation data which have greatly increased understand-
ing of intermediate fuel chemistry. Some key experimental specia-
tion challenges are discussed briefly:

Pa) Similar to other fundamental combustion experiments on gaso-
line fuels, adequate vaporization and avoidance of fuel conden-
sation is very important, particularly for gasolines with a
relatively high boiling point.

Pb) For low-pressure flames, measurement of flame temperature as
a function of height above the burner is critical for the useful-
ness of the data. Thermocouples [138], laser-induced fluores-
cence (LIF) [139] and laser absorption methods [140] have been
utilized to measure the flame temperature profile. However, all
of these methods have inherent uncertainties and limitations,
and the uncertainties on the measured temperature lead to chal-
lenges in adequately modeling the speciation data.

Pc) A sampling probe may lead to significant distortions and non-
idealities in the otherwise unperturbed flame. These non-ideali-
ties and uncertainties were addressed previously [136,141,142],
and must be taken into consideration when using speciation
data for model development and validation.

Pd) Additional challenges arise during the analyses of the raw exper-
imental data. The intermediates/products are formed from

laser absorption spectroscopy. Simulated temperature is obtained by running a zero-
dimensional reactive simulation. Pc D 9.21 bar, Tc D 742 K, 2.56% n-pentane/20.46%

Pmodeled using non-reactive experiments. For example, this
could result in over-prediction of ignition delay times compared
to the measured data. Nasir and Farooq [134] presented a novel
temperature measurement in a rapid compression machine
(Fig. 12). The temperature measured by laser absorption for first
stage heat release was lower than predicted by the zero-dimen-
sional simulation. The higher predicted temperature during the
first stage also expedited the second stage ignition in the simula-
tion. Among various solutions proposed to model two-stage
ignition, simulating the two-stage ignition process with a multi-
zone model provided a good compromise compared to full CFD
simulation [135]. However, such multi-zone models are not uni-
versal and must be adjusted to the specific RCM; also, multi-
zone models increase computational cost significantly compared
to the zero-dimensional kinetic simulations.

Pg) Finally, it should be mentioned that RCMs used in the literature
vary in their design and geometry; heat loss characteristics and
crevice confinement are very different from one machine to
another. This makes comparison of ignition delay data across
various machines difficult. Meaningful comparisons can only be
made with the help of simulations that consider respective heat
losses in individual machines.

P3.1.3. Flame speed measurements

PFlame speed is critical to modeling flame propagation in SI
engines and is an important validation goal for the high-temperature
chemical kinetic mechanism. Although the flame propagation in real
engines is turbulent, laminar flame speed measurements in ideal
reactors provide the data needed to constrain the reaction models. It
is important to understand flame speed variation as a function of
equivalence ratio, initial temperature and initial pressure. Various
kinds of reactors/apparatus are used for flame speed measurements.
PThe challenges encountered during flame speed measurements of
gasoline fuels are somewhat dependent on the experimental meth-
odology used for flame speed determination. The reader is referred
to a recent review by Egolfopoulos et al. [136] in which the chal-
lenges and uncertainties associated with various laminar flame
experiments are exhaustively discussed. Some pertinent points are
mentioned below:

Pa) In general, adequate fuel vaporization is important for liquid
fuels, and particularly for multi-component liquid fuels such as
gasoline. For example,
it is important to use heated tube
between the evaporator and the burner; Sileghem et al. [137]
reported that fuel condensation in non-heated tubes can lead to

peaks of the fuel components and their fragments interfere with
analysis of the intermediates/products. The uncertainty of prod-
uct quantification becomes greater compared with single-com-
ponent fuel speciation experiments.

3.2. Fundamental combustion experiment literature

P3.2.1. Autoignition studies in shock tubes and rapid compression
machines

PDespite the importance and practical implications of gasoline
fuels, ignition delay time measurements of distillate gasolines are
scarce in the literature. Primarily, three types of gasoline fuels have
been studied in homogeneous reactors of shock tube and rapid com-
pression machines. RD387 gasoline was used in several previous
studies [15,143,144], and represents the non-oxygenated, regular
grade gasoline used in the U.S. with an average octane number,
(RON C MON)/2, of 87 and an H/C ratio of 1.85. Two recent stud-
ies [145,146] have used oxygenated RON 95 gasolines. The third
type of gasoline fuels being investigated are the FACE (fuels for
advanced combustion engines) gasolines.

POne of the first ignition delay time studies on distillate gasoline
(RD387) was carried out by Gauthier et al. [143]. Ignition delay times
were measured behind reflected shock waves over a broad range of
conditions; 15(cid:1)60 bar, 900(cid:1) 1300 K, 0.5(cid:1)2.1 f. The effect of exhaust
gas recirculation (EGR) on ignition delay times was also examined by
adding 20(cid:1)30% of synthetic EGR mixture composed of CO2, H2O, O2
and N2. The entire NTC behavior was not observed due to the lack of
experimental data at
lower temperatures, which would have
required longer shock tube test times. An interesting feature of the
work was the comparison of the gasoline ignition delay times with
experimentally measured ignition delays of two ternary surrogates
of n-heptane/isooctane/toluene. The surrogates and the gasoline
matched well over the experimental conditions of their study, as
shown in Fig. 13. However, the differences between surrogates and
real fuels are expected to be pronounced at lower temperatures,
which were not covered in the work of Gauthier et al. [143]. A curi-
ous feature of the work was the use of two surrogates which
matched in their volumetric and molar fractions, respectively. We
hypothesize that the authors’ goal was to match the gasoline compo-
sition in molar ratios of 63/20/17% (surrogate B) for isooctane/tolu-
ene/n-heptane, but made the surrogate in volumetric 63/20/17%
fractions (surrogate A) in error.

PThe lack of low-temperature data in the work of Gauthier et al.
[143] motivated Kukkadapu et al. [144,147,148] to study RD387
autoignition in a rapid compression machine over 650(cid:1)900 K and
pressures of 20 and 40 bar. The RD387 used in this study had a
slightly different H/C ratio of 1.87, but similar values of RON (91)
and sensitivity (8.3) as the RD387 used by Gauthier et al. [143]. As
seen in Fig. 14, the RCM measurements clearly showed the NTC
behavior for gasoline ignition, which was not apparent in the shock
tube study of Gauthier et al. [143]. Another important contribution
of the RCM study was the measurement of first-stage ignition
delays in addition to the overall (or total) ignition delay. The first-
stage ignition delays are highly valuable for understanding and pre-
dicting the fuel reactivity in the NTC and low-temperature regions.
Through their RCM measurements, Kukkadapu et al. [144,147,148]
found that the ternary surrogate of n-heptane/isooctane/toluene
proposed in the work of Gauthier et al. [143] failed to capture
the RD387 ignition at low temperatures. A newly proposed four-
component surrogate [149] comprised of n-heptane / isooctane /
toluene / 2-pentene agreed better with the measured ignition delay
times of the gasoline. Although Kukkadapu et al. [144,147,148]
demonstrated the importance of multi-component surrogates for
capturing low temperature autoignition behavior of gasoline fuels,
it was not possible to generalize these results as their work focused
only on one specific gasoline. Also, despite the better performance

Pof the four-component surrogate, some disagreements with the
gasoline ignition were still observed at lean fuel conditions in the
rapid compression machine.

PChung et al. [145] focused on the two-stage ignition behavior
while studying the autoignition of a RON 95 gasoline in a rapid
compression machine. Pressure time-history profiles and ignition
delay times of the gasoline were compared with pure components
(isooctane, n-heptane, 1-heptene, 2-heptene, 3-heptene) as well as
surrogate mixtures comprised of three components (n-heptane, iso-
octane, toluene) and seven components (n-heptane,
isooctane,
cyclohexane, toluene, cyclohexene, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, ethanol). It
was argued that addition of cyclic alkenes to the surrogate mixture
is important in emulating first stage and total ignition delay behav-
ior of the gasoline.

PAgbro et al. [146] recently studied the influence of 20% n-butanol
addition to the autoignition of a reference RON 95 gasoline in a rapid
compression machine at 20 bar and 678(cid:1)858 K. The addition of n-
butanol resulted in longer ignition delay times at the low tempera-
tures of the study, as expected. However, at temperatures higher
than 800 K, the gasoline/n-butanol blend exhibited slightly shorter
ignition delay times than pure gasoline. Suitably formulated TPRF
and TPRF/n-butanol surrogates were also tested experimentally and
these, respectively, reproduced the autoignition behavior of gasoline
and gasoline/n-butanol blend reasonably well.

PSeveral autoignition studies of FACE gasolines have been carried
out at KAUST, with collaborative contributions from various labora-
tories around the world. As discussed earlier, FACE gasolines
comprise fuels with varying RON, MON, sensitivity and chemical
composition; therefore, the use of these widely different gasolines
can provide the data and knowledge needed to formulate a general-
ized surrogate formulation strategy.

PThe first autoignition study on FACE gasolines was carried out by
Sarathy et al. [150] on FACE A and C, having similar octane numbers
(RON and MON »84) but varying compositions. It was shown that
both gasolines exhibited comparable ignition delay times over
the wide range of experimental conditions (715(cid:1)1500 K, 10(cid:1)40 bar,
f D 0.5 and 1), and a PRF surrogate adequately captured the ignition
requirements of these gasolines. Five- and six-component surrogates
for FACE A and C, respectively, were formulated in this work, based
on the DHA (detailed hydrocarbon analysis) of the two gasolines.
These multi-component surrogates provided slightly better agree-
ment than the PRF surrogate at the very low temperatures of the
study.

PSarathy et al. [58] recently studied the autoignition and surrogate
formulation for two high octane FACE gasolines, F and G. These two
gasolines had very similar antiknock indices, (RON C MON)/2, of
91.6 and 91.3. Apart from compositional differences, the two fuels
had different octane sensitivities (FACE F: RON D 94.4, S D 5.6; FACE
G: RON D 96.8, S D 11). Ignition delay time measurements in shock
tube and rapid compression machine showed that both gasolines
were equally reactive at high temperatures (T > 900 K). At low tem-
peratures, FACE F having lower RON was slightly more reactive than
FACE G. On the other hand, FACE F having lower octane sensitivity
displayed greater NTC behavior than FACE G. Experiments per-
formed in the rapid compression machine also revealed the decrease
of low-temperature heat release (LTHR) and increase of intermedi-
ate-temperature heat release (ITHR) with increasing octane sensitiv-
ity. These experimentally observed trends are shown in Fig. 15. It
can also be clearly seen that FACE A and C, having RON of 84, have
shorter ignition delay times in the NTC region and at low tempera-
tures. Experimental ignition delay times were compared against
two-component PRF, ternary TPRF, and multi-component surro-
gates. Autoignition of low-sensitivity (S D 5.6) FACE F was captured
equally well by all three surrogate types; however, only the multi-
component surrogate performed well in reproducing the ignition
behavior of high-sensitivity (S D 11) FACE G gasoline.

PJaved et al. [151] recently carried out a shock tube and rapid com-
pression machine ignition delay study on two low octane gasolines,
FACE I and J, over 650(cid:1)1200 K, 20(cid:1)40 bar and f D 0.5 and 1. These
two gasolines have similar AKI of »70 and similar octane sensitivi-
ties of < 3. However, their compositions are quite different: FACE I
being primarily paraffinic while FACE J contains about 30% (by mole)
aromatics. The two fuels exhibited very similar ignition delay times
over the wide range of experimental conditions. Experiments and
simulations performed with PRF and multi-component surrogates
showed that a PRF surrogate can adequately capture the reactivity of
both gasolines, with the PRF surrogate being slightly more reactive
at
the rapid compression
machine.

the low temperature conditions of

PRelevant to these low octane FACE gasolines are two recent stud-
ies carried out on Saudi Aramco light naphtha (RON D 64.5, MON D
63.5) and Haltermann straight run naphtha (RON D 60, MON D
58.3). Javed et al. [152] and AlAbbad et al. [153a] measured ignition
delay times of these naphtha fuels in a shock tube and rapid com-
pression machine over a wide range of experimental conditions.
They also carried out experimental measurements of PRF and multi-
component surrogates for the two fuels. It was shown that PRF sur-
rogates adequately captured the naphtha reactivity at high tempera-
tures and in the NTC region. However, the PRF surrogates were more
reactive at low temperature conditions, the differences being greater
for higher fuel concentration cases (f D 1 and 2). Multi-component
surrogates, formulated by matching the fuel octane numbers, H/C
ratio, carbon type and distillation curve, reproduced the fuel ignition
behavior over the entire range of temperatures, as shown in Fig. 16.

PFinally, Lee et al. [154] recently carried out a detailed study on
the autoignition of two oxygenated certified gasolines, supplied by
Haltermann (RON D 91, MON D 83.4, ethanol D 8 vol% ) and Coryton
(RON D 97.5, MON D 86.6, ethanol D 4 vol% ). Experiments were per-
formed over 650(cid:1)1250 K, pressures of 10(cid:1)40 bar and equivalence
ratios of 0.45, 0.9 and 1.8. Fig. 17 shows that both gasolines exhibited
similar ignition delay times at high temperatures (T > 900 K). At
intermediate temperatures, the Haltermann gasoline, having lower
RON and lower sensitivity, exhibited higher reactivity and greater
NTC behavior than the Coryton gasolines. At the very low tempera-
tures (T < 700 K), both fuels again exhibited similar ignition delay
times. The differences between the two gasolines were more pro-
nounced at lower pressures and higher equivalence ratios. Three dif-
ferent types of surrogates were formulated for each gasoline. These
included three-component TPRF surrogates, four-component TPRF/
ethanol surrogates and eight-component surrogates. Surrogate per-
formance was analyzed using detailed chemical kinetic simulations
and partial experimental ignition delay measurements of the surro-
gates. At low temperatures, the TPRF surrogates were much less
reactive than their corresponding gasolines. On the other hand,
both four-component and eight-component surrogates adequately
captured the ignition delay times of oxygenated gasolines over the
wide range of experimental conditions.

PFig. 18 plots ignition delay times of eight gasoline fuels at initial
pressure of 20 bar and a range of initial temperatures. Several inter-
esting trends may be observed. At high temperatures, all gasolines
have almost identical ignition delay times. The NTC region clearly
manifests the dependence of ignition delay times on RON and sensi-
tivity (RON (cid:1) MON). The two low-octane FACE fuels, I and J, have the
lowest ignition delay times in the NTC region. The two mid-octane
FACE fuels, A and C, have longer ignition delay times. Finally, the
high-octane gasolines (FACE F and G, Coryton and Haltermann) have
the longest ignition delay times in the NTC region. These fuels also
exhibit slower reactivity at the very low temperatures. Coryton and
FACE G have the highest sensitivity (» 11) among the high octane
fuels and thus exhibit relatively less NTC behavior. On the other
hand, FACE F has the lowest sensitivity (5.6) among this group of
high-octane fuels and thus exhibits the steepest NTC character.

PApart from the handful of studies devoted to real gasoline fuels,
there have been a relatively large number of experimental autoigni-
tion studies carried out on gasoline surrogates. These include studies
[158(cid:1)160], n-heptane/toluene
on PRFs
[40,161,162], isooctane/toluene [41,161], ethanol blends [163(cid:1)165],
and other multi-component blends [45,161,164,166(cid:1)168]. These
references and the relevant experimental details are listed in Table 3.
These studies on gasoline surrogates have been very helpful in vali-
dating the chemical kinetic mechanisms of multi-component surro-
gate mixtures.

P3.2.2. Laminar flame speed studies

PSimilar to ignition delay times, flame speed measurements of dis-
tillate gasolines are limited in the literature. One of the first meas-
urements of gasoline flame speed were performed by Zhao et al.
[169] on a research gasoline (CR-87) having an octane number of 87.
Experiments were performed using the stagnation jet-wall flame
configuration and particle image velocimetry (PIV), where laminar
burning velocity was obtained by linear extrapolation of stretched
flame speed to zero stretch speed. Measurements were carried out
over a range of equivalence ratios (0.6(cid:1)1.4), atmospheric pressure
and initial temperatures of 353 K and 500 K. Comparison of the mea-
sured data with previous PRF 90 laminar speeds showed that PRF

Pcould serve as a suitable surrogate for laminar flame speeds of CR-87
gasoline.

PJerzembeck et al. [170] measured laminar burning velocities of
a commercial gasoline and a PRF 87 surrogate using the constant
volume bomb and Schlieren method. The authors did not provide
specifications for the gasoline; however, from comparisons with
the PRF 87 surrogate, it may be assumed to have a RON of 87. Flame
speeds were measured at initial temperature of 373 K, equivalence
ratios ranging 0.7(cid:1)1.2 and initial pressures ranging 10(cid:1)25 bar. Over-
all, the results showed that PRF 87 can capture the burning velocities
of the gasoline over the range of experimental conditions, with some
deviations at rich conditions. A reduced high temperature PRF mech-
anism was also shown to perform satisfactorily for predicting lami-
nar flame speeds.

PTian et al. [171] measured laminar burning velocities of Euro-
pean EN 228 gasoline (RON > 95) and compared the gasoline
data with ethanol and 2,5-dimethyl furan (DMF) as alternative
candidate fuels. These measurements were performed in a con-
stant volume vessel using high speed Schlieren visualization.
Experimental conditions spanned equivalence ratios of 0.6(cid:1)2.0
and initial temperatures of 323(cid:1)373 K. As seen in Fig. 19, burning
velocities of DMF matched with those of gasoline within 10%;
while ethanol burning velocities were larger by » 30(cid:1)40%.

Psurrogate over a wide range of equivalence ratios and initial tem-
perature of 358 K. They also showed that up to 15% of ethanol
addition to the gasoline had negligible influence on the burning
velocities.

PSileghem et al. [137] utilized the heat flux method to report lami-
nar burning velocities of a commercial non-oxygenated Exxon gaso-
line over equivalence ratios of 0.7(cid:1)1.3 and initial temperatures of
298(cid:1)358 K. They formulated a three-component TPRF surrogate
using the energy fraction mixing rule and showed that the surrogate
matched the burning velocities of the gasoline very well over a wide
range of initial temperatures and equivalence ratios, as illustrated in
Fig. 20. Using the mixing rule, they also argued that a two-compo-
nent PRF surrogate would only work well at lean conditions, and
that toluene addition to the surrogate is necessary to emulate burn-
ing velocities of commercial gasolines containing many aromatic
fractions.

PBurning velocities of a wide range of ternary TPRF mixtures and
three FACE gasolines J (RON D 70), C (RON D 85) and F (RON D 95)
were investigated by Mannaa et al. [173] at elevated pressures up to
6 bar,
initial temperatures of 358 K and equivalence ratios of
0.8(cid:1)1.6. Similar to Sileghem et al. [137], they showed that PRF surro-
gate can capture burning velocities of real gasoline only at lean con-
ditions. For each gasoline, Mannaa et al. [173] formulated three-
component TPRF surrogates to capture burning velocities over
the wide range of their experimental conditions. In a later work,
Mannaa et al. [174] studied the influence of ethanol addition (60 and
85 vol% ) to FACE C gasoline and its TPRF surrogate. They concluded
that burning velocity enhancement from ethanol addition was simi-
lar in both the gasoline and TPRF surrogate.

PFig. 21 compares laminar burning velocities of gasoline fuels
reported in various studies. These gasolines had varying RON and
compositions. However, it may be argued that laminar burning
velocities are more sensitive to gasoline composition and are negli-
gibly affected by the RON. For example, the higher velocities mea-
sured by Dirrenberger et al. [172] may be attributed to the
presence of oxygenates in the gasoline used in that study, but the
non-availability of detailed composition (DHA) makes it difficult to
compare burning velocities of different gasolines.

PThere have been several studies of laminar burning velocities
on gasoline surrogate mixtures, such as PRFs [175(cid:1)178], TPRFs
[174,178], ethanol blends [177(cid:1)179], and butanol blends [180,181].
These are listed in Table 3 and serve as benchmark studies for vali-
dating high-temperature kinetic mechanisms of multi-component
mixtures.

P3.2.3. Speciation studies of gasoline oxidation

PIgnition delay times and laminar burning velocities are impor-
tant global targets for the development and validation of chemical
kinetic models of gasoline surrogates. However,
time/space-
resolved measurements of combustion species (radicals, intermedi-
ates, products) can provide stringent targets for model validation.
Such measurements have historically been performed for pure
components and simple mixtures. Very few studies have measured
species’ profiles for distillate gasolines.

PChen et al. carried out a detailed speciation study on FACE A and
C [182] and F [183] gasolines in a jet-stirred reactor (JSR) from high
to low temperatures, pressure of 10 bar and equivalence ratios rang-
ing 0.5(cid:1)2. Combustion species were sampled with a probe and ana-
lyzed using gas chromatography (GC) and Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy (FTIR). Measured species’ profiles were compared with
simulations using a simple PRF surrogate and two multi-component
surrogates. As seen in Fig. 22, the simulated profiles from the three
surrogates for FACE A and C are similar and do a reasonably good job
of capturing the overall gasoline reactivity and two-stage oxidation
behavior. Some disagreement was observed in the prediction of

PSimilar work performed by Dirrenberger et al. [172], using the
heat flux method, showed that the burning velocities of a com-
mercial oxygenated gasoline TAE7000 (RON » 95.6) matched very
well with a three-component TPRF (toluene/n-heptane/isooctane)

Pnovel approach, comparing quantities of interest to discern the dif-
ferences between the intermediate species profiles of both gasolines
and the chemical kinetic simulations of surrogate mixtures. In agree-
ment with previous autoignition studies on FACE A and C [150], they
concluded that PRF surrogates are suitable for capturing the detailed
flame chemistry of alkane-rich gasolines.

PJaved et al. [186] applied four simultaneous laser-based diagnos-
tics in a shock tube study to measure species’ profiles during the
high temperature oxidation of FACE A, C and PRF 84 surrogate. As
shown in Fig. 23, they observed that the two gasolines and their PRF
surrogate produced very similar radical pool (OH), intermediate spe-
cies (CO) and products (CO2, H2pO), thereby explaining their nearly
identical ignition delay times at high temperatures.

PThere have been several speciation studies on gasoline surrogate
mixtures, such as PRFs [186(cid:1)188], n-heptane/toluene [188,189],
alcohol blends [190(cid:1)193], and other multi-component mixtures
[72,166,167,194,195]. These are listed in Table 3 and serve as good
targets for validating the detailed kinetic mechanisms of multi-
component mixtures.

P3.2.4. Gasoline surrogate studies in diffusion flames

PSection 2 of this paper highlighted the role of fuel physical and
chemical kinetic properties on PM (i.e., soot) formation in engines.
For example, it was shown that the fuel volatility characteristics,
aromatic content, oxygenate content, and antiknock quality all influ-
ence PM formation in engines. It is important for surrogate fuel sim-
ulations to emulate the soot formation characteristics of real fuels,

Pin order to design gasoline engines with lower PM emissions. Soot in
SI engines is typically formed due to insufficient fuel/air mixing or
from fuel spray impinging on the wall and not completely vaporizing
[196,197]. Both scenarios create rich pockets or diffusion flamelets
where soot can be formed and not completely oxidized.

PDiffusion flames are often used to study the tendency of a specific
fuel to form soot particles. Since the addition of oxygenated species

P(such as ethanol) to hydrocarbons is expected to reduce soot forma-
tion, a few studies have been dedicated to carry out diffusion flame
experiments of gasoline and ethanol blends. Marciq [198] performed
coflow flame experiments on E0 (pure gasoline), E20 (20% ethanol /
80% gasoline), E50 (50% ethanol / 50% gasoline) and E85 (85% ethanol
/ 15% gasoline). Soot size distribution was measured as a function of
height above the burner using scanning mobility particle sizer

isooctane and toluene.

PA few other studies of gasoline and surrogates include the works
of Liu et al. [204] on a RON 87 gasoline and blends of n-heptane/iso-
octane/toluene using sub-millimeter droplets, Farouk et al. [205] on
PRF droplet burning, Baumgardner et al. [206] on PRF and n-hep-
tane/n-butanol blends in a constant volume combustion device, and
Naser et al. [207] on PRF and TRF (n-heptane/toluene) in an ignition
quality tester.

P3.2.5. Future experimental work

PThe literature presented demonstrates that there has been con-
siderable work done on gasoline surrogate components and surro-
gate mixtures. However, research on gasoline fuels in fundamental
combustion devices has been inadequate. Such work is necessary to
build a sound basis for surrogate formulation strategies and kinetic
mechanisms of gasoline surrogates. These experiments should
encompass global reactivity data (ignition delay times, flame speeds,
extinction, autoignition) as well as details of reactivity trends (spe-
cies time-histories). The fuels chosen for experimentation should
span a wide range of properties (RON, MON, H/C ratio, distillation
range, oxygenation, composition) that would be expected in current
and future energy conversion devices.

4. Chemical kinetic modeling of gasoline surrogate fuel
combustion

PThe chemical kinetics of gasoline was previously discussed in the
context of experimental work performed on surrogate mixtures and
full boiling range refinery gasoline fuels. Numerical simulations can
also aid understanding the effects of gasoline fuel composition on
combustion properties and engine performance. These simulations
rely on chemical kinetic models comprising a series of elementary
reaction steps that describe the molecular-level transformations of
reactants (i.e., fuel/air) to intermediate and product species, as well
as thermal energy. Chemical kinetic models are capable of simulat-
ing reactions in the flame zone that result in heat release, the igni-
tion characteristics of fuel/air mixtures, and the formation of major
and minor pollutant species.

PGasoline fuels contain hundreds of different molecules, and
developing such kinetic models for each individual component is
unmanageable. Kinetic models are only available for surrogate fuel
mixtures comprising a limited number of components. This section
presents available chemical kinetic models for various pure hydro-
carbon and oxygenated species that can be used in gasoline surro-
gate fuel mixtures. Kinetic models for surrogate mixtures are then
presented, with insights into engine-relevant phenomenon that
these models provide, such as flame propagation, engine knock, and
pollutant formation mechanisms.

4.1. Chemical kinetic models for pure components

PAs described previously, gasoline fuel components can be divided
into five main hydrocarbon classes (paraffins, isoparaffins, olefins,
naphthenes, and aromatics) and oxygenates. The kinetic models for
each individual component comprises a set reaction classes and rate
coefficient estimations, which can be assigned manually or via auto-
matic generation tools (e.g., NETGEN [209], EXGAS [210,211], Reac-
tion Mechanism Generator [212(cid:1)216], and Genesys [217]). The
models are developed in a hierarchical manner because combustion
proceeds via a series of elementary steps that fragments the parent
fuel into smaller intermediate species, which subsequently react to
form stable products. This concept is well represented by the Dooley
et al.’s [218] schematic representation of real fuel combustion
kinetic phenomena, as shown in Fig. 25. Complex fuels contain
many chemical structures, but when burned, the intermediates

P(SMPS). It was found that the addition of up to 50% ethanol to gaso-
line had little effect on flame properties. The E20 and E50 flames
behaved almost the same as the E0 flame. However, the E85 flame
resulted in 4(cid:1)7 times reduction in nuclei mode mass and a reduction
factor of about two in the size of soot agglomerates compared to the
E0 flame.

PRecently, Khosousi et al. [199] studied the same fuels as Marciq
[198] in a similar configuration of coflow laminar diffusion flames.
However, in contrast to Marciq [198], Khosousi et al. [199] heavily
diluted the fuel stream with nitrogen to prevent the flames from
smoking. They also measured radially-resolved soot volume fraction
distributions by employing a two-dimensional line-of-sight attenua-
tion (2D-LOSA) technique and an Abel inversion algorithm [199]. The
measured volume fractions in Fig. 24 show decreasing amounts of
soot with increasing ethanol fraction. However, the suppression of
soot only becomes significant for 50% or more ethanol. A numerical
model and gasoline surrogate proposed in the study predicted the
experimentally observed trends.

PLemaire et al. [200] used a turbulent spray flame to study the
influence of ethanol addition to gasoline on soot formation ten-
dency. Spatially resolved measurements of soot volume fraction and
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS) were made by simulta-
neous applications of LII and LIF. They observed that 10(cid:1)30% addi-
tion of ethanol to gasoline significantly reduced the concentration of
soot precursors (PAH) and about 25(cid:1)81% reduction in the total
quantity of soot. Experiments performed with gasoline surrogates
and surrogate/ethanol blends adequately reproduced the gasoline
and gasoline/ethanol soot production trends. The results also indi-
cated that the gasoline/ethanol soot oxidized faster than the pure
gasoline soot.

PBieleveld et al. [201] employed a counterflow diffusion flame
technique to study the extinction and autoignition of two gasolines
(RON 87 and 91), PRF surrogates and multi-component surrogates
comprising n-heptane / isooctane / toluene / methylcyclohexane.
Experiments and calculations performed with a semi-detailed kinetic
mechanism showed that the extinction/ignition characteristics of
PRF 87 and PRF 91 were different from those of the correspond-
ing gasolines. However, two multi-component surrogates were
able to reproduce the combustion characteristics of the gasoline
fuels. The results affirm that a simple PRF surrogate is not ade-
quate to model the combustion and emission behavior of a fully
blended gasoline.

PChoi et al. [202] and Kashif et al. [203] utilized counterflow and
coflow diffusion flames, respectively, to investigate sooting tendency

cies in the combustion of larger hydrocarbons. Figure reproduced from [218] with permission from Elsevier Publishing.

Pproduced contain much fewer distinct chemical functionalities.
Reactions involving these chemical intermediates characterize the
small species radical pool, which governs important combustion
processes (e.g., ignition delay, flame propagation, emissions forma-
tion). The schematic highlights the importance of having a common
high fidelity small molecule reaction mechanism (or “core mecha-
nism”), on top of which the reaction mechanism for larger hydrocar-
bons can be developed. These core mechanisms typically include
detailed and well validated reaction mechanisms for oxidation and
pyrolysis of hydrogen and C1(cid:1)(cid:1)C4 hydrocarbon species. Popular core
mechanisms for developing gasoline fuel surrogates models include
NUI Galway's AramcoMech [219(cid:1)222], Princeton Mechanism
[223(cid:1)226], San Diego Mechanism [227(cid:1)229], Politecnico di Milano's
CRECK mechanism [201,230], and Stanford's Foundational Fuel
Chemistry Model (FFCM-1) [231]. The reactions for larger hydrocar-
bons are added to the core reaction mechanism. The following sub-
sections summarize available kinetic models for larger hydrocarbons,
which could be combined to create gasoline surrogate kinetic mod-
els.

PTable 4 is an overview of the available kinetic models published
since 2000. Table 4 presents information for various n-alkanes,
isoalkanes, cycloalkanes, alkenes, aromatics, and oxygenated fuels
that are typically found in gasoline. Molecular formula and boiling
points are also presented for quick identification of surrogate com-
ponents with desired physical properties. Table 4 focuses on com-
prehensive chemical kinetic models, which have been validated
across a broad range of temperatures and pressures. Several com-
ments on the validity range of the developed chemical kinetic
models are given in Table 4. As clarified in the following section,
the merging of hydrocarbon mechanisms requires a common core
mechanism, so wherever possible, the core mechanism utilized in
the model is highlighted.

P4.1.1. Paraffins/n-Alkanes

Pn-Alkanes (or paraffins) are the most widely studied class of
hydrocarbons in gasoline fuels. Previous significant reviews by Sim-
mie [232] and Battin-Leclerc [233] have highlighted many important
aspects of n-alkane kinetic modeling. The fact that they have been
widely studied, both experimentally and numerically, has resulted
in high fidelity chemical kinetic models which are readily adopted
into gasoline surrogate kinetic modeling studies. The high tempera-
ture oxidation kinetics of n-alkanes is well understood, as it is initi-
ated by H-atom abstraction from the fuel, and typically followed by
scission of the C(cid:1)(cid:1)C bond b to the radical site (i.e., b-scission), as
shown in the red box in, left panel. The resulting products are a
smaller alkyl radical and an alkene, of which the former under-
goes further b-scission, and the latter is consumed by H-atom
abstraction. At very high temperatures (i.e., above 1250(cid:1)1400 K)
or in the absence of oxygen, reactivity is initiated by unimolecu-
lar decomposition of the fuel to form two alkyl radicals (i.e.,
pyrolytic C(cid:1)(cid:1)C scission). Other important reactions include alkyl
radical isomerizations, alkenyl radical decompositions, and retro-
ene reactions. Detailed descriptions of the various high tempera-
ture reactions classes in n-alkane oxidation are presented in the
literature [232,234,235].

PIn general, the high temperature oxidation mechanism controls
engine-relevant phenomenon such as premixed laminar flame
speed, premixed flame extinction, and high temperature ignition
delay (i.e., above »1000 K). An interesting observation is that the
high temperature oxidation behavior of n-alkanes typically found in
transportation fuels are remarkably similar. This is best exemplified
by the work of Ji et al. [236], in which the authors experimentally
studied the premixed laminar flame speeds and extinction strain
rates for C5(cid:1)(cid:1)C12 n-alkanes in air. The authors found that all n-alka-
nes larger than C5 exhibit the same laminar flame speed and extinc-
tion strain rates, as shown in Fig. 26. The reason for the similarity is

Pwell captured by chemical kinetic models, and can be attributed to
the fact that all large n-alkanes decompose at high temperatures to a
similar pool of radical species (mainly H, CH3, C2H5, and C3H7). The
concentrations of the various radical species and their formation
rates are remarkably similar despite the size of the parent n-alkane
fuel [237]. These findings support the thesis of Dooley et al. [218],
which states that only distinct chemical functionalities govern the
reactivity of fuels; and in the case of large n-alkanes, the size of the
carbon chain is not a distinct chemical functionality with respect to
high temperature reactivity. An important implication of this finding

Pis that in replicating the high temperature combustion characteris-
tics of a target gasoline fuel, any n-alkane (n-pentane or larger) could
be a suitable surrogate to represent all the n-alkanes in the gasoline.
PThe activation energy for alkyl radical decomposition reactions is
around 30 kcal/mol [238], so at lower temperatures (i.e., below
900(cid:1)950 K) these reactions are unimportant. Therefore, the n-
alkane oxidation mechanism is dominated by a series of low temper-
ature auto-oxidation reactions. This scheme has been previously
described in detail in articles by Zador et al. [239] and Battin-Leclerc
[233]. It includes the early schemes postulated by Cartlidge and

PThe classic low temperature oxidation mechanism is widely used
to explain the process leading to ignition of n-alkanes at low temper-
atures, as well as the monotonic decrease in ignition delay time with
temperatures below »800 K. At intermediate temperatures of
»800(cid:1)900 K, several reactions overcome their activation energy to
become competitive with the reactions leading to chain branching.
First, the ROO radical can undergo a concerted elimination reaction,
leading to the formation of an alkene and HO2 radical, widely
accepted as a chain terminating route because HO2 radical is not as
reactive as OH radical. Second, the QOOH radical can undergo cycli-
zation to form a cyclic ether and an OH radical, which is a chain-
propagating pathway. These two competing pathways are responsi-
ble for the negative temperature coefficient behavior observed in n-
alkane ignition at temperatures of »800(cid:1)950 K, in which ignition
delay time increases with increased temperature.

PTable 4 presents comprehensive chemical kinetic models for vari-
ous n-alkanes found in gasoline fuels. It is clear that well validated
kinetic models exist for all the important n-alkanes, i.e., n-butane, n-
pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane, and n-octane. Arguably the most up-
to-date and widely validated n-alkane mechanisms include those
developed at NUI Galway by Henry Curran's group for n-butane
[246], n-pentane [247,248], n-hexane [249], and n-heptane [250].
These models are capable of predicting ignition phenomenon at a
range of temperatures, speciation profiles in flames and flow reac-
tors, and high temperature flame phenomenon (e.g., laminar flame
speed, extinction, etc.). All these models are built on the same base
chemistry (i.e., AramcoMech), therefore making them easy to merge
for gasoline surrogate fuel kinetic modeling. They have also been
useful for developing comprehensive models for C8 and larger n-
alkanes, as recently demonstrated by Cai et al. [251] by optimizing
and extrapolating rate rules. It is important to note that none of
these models contain the aforementioned 3rd O2 addition reaction
mechanism.

PA comparison of the simulated homogeneous gas-phase ignition
delay times of various n-alkanes is presented in Fig. 27 for initial
conditions of 25 bar and stoichiometric fuel/air mixtures. It is clear
that high temperature (above »950 K) ignition delay times of n-alka-
nes are similar. Similar ignition delay times are also observed at low
temperatures (below »725 K) for C5(cid:1)(cid:1)C7 n-alkanes. However, in the
intermediate temperature regime (750(cid:1)950 K), there is a clear dif-
ference in the reactivity of various n-alkanes. The ignition delay time

Pdecreases with increasing carbon chain length, which is directly rel-
evant to observed octane number decrease with increasing chain
length. This indicates that there is a strong relationship between
homogeneous gas-phase ignition delay times and octane numbers.
The differences in ignition delay times for various n-alkanes is attrib-
uted to the number of consecutive secondary CH2 (i.e., methylene) in
the carbon chain. Secondary C(cid:1)(cid:1)H bonds enable low temperature
chain branching pathways because their low bond dissociation
energy facilitates hydrogen abstraction and intramolecular H-atom
migration reactions. In the context of low temperature reactivity,
Won et al. [252] and Lapuerta et al. [253] have shown that the ratio
of methylene to methyl (CH2/CH3) groups is a distinct chemical func-
tionality that controls ignition. Larger n-alkanes have higher CH2/
CH3 ratios and therefore shorter ignition delay times in the interme-
diate temperature regime.

PThese findings are important for gasoline surrogate fuel formula-
tion and kinetic modeling because they imply that predictions of n-
alkane ignition characteristics(cid:1)and thereby antiknock quality(cid:1)are

Psensitive to n-alkane carbon number. Therefore, surrogate fuel stud-
ies focusing on ignition and/or combustion phasing at intermediate
temperatures need to select n-alkane surrogate components that are
representative of those present in the real fuel. This can be achieved
by selecting n-alkanes at the low and high end of the carbon number
spectrum, so that when they are blended together in appropriate
proportions, they match the reactivity of the n-alkane mixture in the
real fuel.

P4.1.2. isoParaffins/isoAlkanes

PisoAlkanes, or isoparaffins, are alkanes hydrocarbons with one or
more alkyl substitution. This class of molecules constitutes an
important fraction of gasoline fuels, in which methyl and ethyl
substitutions are arranged on a carbon backbone. Despite their pre-
dominance in gasoline fuels, there is a dearth of fundamental com-
bustion kinetic studies of such species, especially true for ignition at
low and intermediate temperatures. The most widely studied isoal-
kane is 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (isooctane), because it is a primary
reference fuel surrogate. Most gasoline fuels comprise various iso-
mers of heptane (nine possible isomers) and octane (18 possible iso-
mers); isomers of other alkanes also exist. As shown in Fig. 28, C7
isoalkanes have higher octane numbers than their n-alkane counter-
part (i.e., n-heptane). Octane number increases with the number of
alkyl substitutions, and the latter is also dependent on the position
of the alkyl substitutions. Kinetic modeling of various octane and
decane isomers by Sarathy et al. [234,254(cid:1)258] has provided chemi-
cal kinetic explanations for the variations in ignition delay time, and
hence octane number, observed with varying number and location
of alkyl substitutions. These kinetic aspects are discussed in more
detail below.

PThe high and low temperature oxidation of isoalkanes is concep-
tually similar to that of n-alkanes. The same types of reactions occur;
however, the primary effect of introducing alkyl substitutions is to
alter the rates of various reactions, thereby changing branching
ratios to the pool of reactive intermediate species. Alkyl substitu-
tions introduce tertiary and quaternary carbon sites to the alkane
structure, of which the former have lower C(cid:1)(cid:1)H bond dissociation
energies than primary C(cid:1)(cid:1)H and secondary C(cid:1)(cid:1)H bonds. This reduces
the energy barrier for H-atom abstraction and H-atom migration
reactions from tertiary C(cid:1)(cid:1)H when compared to primary and sec-
ondary C(cid:1)(cid:1)H bonds. Several studies exist on the higher temperature
combustion kinetics of various isoalkanes. Exemplary studies depict-
ing the role of methyl substitution on high temperature reactivity
are those by Ji et al. [259] on laminar flame propagation of octane
isomers and Liu et al. [260] on counterflow flame non-premixed
flame ignition of octane and decane isomers. In the former work
[259], the authors presented measured and simulated laminar flame

Fig. 28. The nine isomers of heptane and their measured RON/MON values.

Pspeeds for various octane isomers, as shown in . Their results
showed that branched isomers exhibit lower laminar flame speeds,
which is attributed to the increased production of H-atom scaveng-
ing resonantly stabilized intermediate radical species, such as allyl
and isobutenyl radicals. The initial high temperature oxidation of
the fuel molecules is similar between n-alkane and isoalkanes, but
increasing the number of methyl branches alters the pool of C1(cid:1)(cid:1)C4
intermediate species, which in turn alters the overall flame structure
and reactivity.

PAs mentioned previously, altering the rates of internal H-atom
migration also has important implications on low temperature radi-
cal chain branching, propagation, and termination reactions, which
in turn affect ignition delay times. Introducing alkyl substitutions
also increases the total number of primary C(cid:1)(cid:1)H bonds, which are
comparably less reactive than secondary and tertiary C(cid:1)(cid:1)H bonds.
For this reason, the critical parameter governing the low and inter-
mediate temperature reactivity of isoalkanes is typically the relative
amounts of CH, CH2, and CH3 functional groups [252,253]. This has
been demonstrated and explained in chemical kinetic modeling
studies of C8 n- and isoalkanes [256].

PTable 4 presents comprehensive chemical kinetic models for vari-
ous isoalkanes found in gasoline fuels. Indeed, there is a lack of avail-
able kinetic models for isoalkanes larger than C5. This makes it
challenging to develop surrogate fuels, as the majority of isoalkanes
found in real gasolines are in the C6(cid:1)(cid:1)C8 range. As mentioned previ-
ously, 2,2,4-trimethylpentane has received the most attention from
the kinetic modeling community. The heptane isomers have been
modeled by Westbrook et al. [261,262], but the data available for
model validation was limited at the time. A series of studies by Sara-
thy et al. [234,254(cid:1)257,263] modeled three different octane iso-
mers, but this was limited to mono- and di-methylated alkanes.
Although only a limited number of isoalkane kinetic models are
available for gasoline surrogate fuel kinetic studies, recent works by
Won et al. [252,264] and Lapuerta et al. [253] have shown that the
ignition characteristics of branched hydrocarbons can be accurately
captured by a mixture of n-alkanes and highly branched isoalkanes
that are to blended match the functional group distribution (i.e., CH,
CH2, CH3) in the targeted isoalkane (or real fuel). This greatly facili-
tates the kinetic modeling effort, as it permits complex gasoline mix-
tures with many isoalkanes variants to be modeled as simpler
mixtures of an n-alkane and a highly branched alkane.

P4.1.3. Aromatics

PBecause they are known to have high octane numbers and high
sensitivity, aromatics are widely used to improve octane in gasoline
fuels. The maximum blending fraction of aromatics is typically
below 30 vol% is US and European gasolines. Typical aromatics in the
gasoline boiling point range include benzene, toluene, xylene iso-
mers, ethylbenzene, and trimethylbenzene isomers. Benzene con-
centrations in gasoline fuels are extremely low due to its high
toxicity and carcinogenicity.

PThe combustion kinetics of aromatics is different than that of n-
and isoparaffins particularly, and in low and intermediate tempera-
tures. Initiating the oxidation of aromatics is difficult because hydro-
gen atoms bonded to the aromatic ring have high bond dissociation
energies. H-atom abstraction from alkyl aromatics, such as toluene,
are easier to initiate because the formed benzyl radical is stabilized
by the presence of the aromatic ring. The oxidation pathways of aro-
matics at high temperatures have been detailed by Brezinsky [265],
but fewer studies are available at lower temperatures of relevance
to ignition in gasoline engines. Recently, Zhang et al. [266] studied
the low temperature oxidation chemistry of toluene by blending it
with dimethyl ether, a highly reactive fuel which generates OH radi-
cals that can initiate toluene oxidation.

PToluene oxidation is primarily initiated by hydrogen abstraction
from the methyl group of toluene, thereby forming the benzyl

Pradical. Minor pathways include H-atom abstraction from the ring or
O radical addition to the ring. Both these radicals lead to the forma-
tion of cresol or cyclopentadienone. In the presence of large amounts
of OH and HO2 radicals, the benzyl radical leads to the formation of
an alkoxy intermediate that decomposes to form either benzylade-
hyde and H radical or formaldehyde and benzene. These reactions of
resonantly stabilized benzyl radicals with other radicals is a key con-
tributor to the lack of low temperature reactivity of aromatics. There
are no low energy isomerization reactions that can lead to radical
chain branching intermediates.

PThe oxidation of other alkylaromatics, such as xylene isomers and
trimethylbenzene isomers, follows pathways similar to toluene. H-
atom abstraction from the methyl group alpha to the ring leads to
the formation of a benzylic radical. Subsequent reactions of the ben-
zylic radicals are similar to those in toluene. In the case of multiple
substituted alkylaromatics where the methyl groups are adjacent (e.
g., ortho-xylene and 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene), there is the possibility
of O2 addition to benzyl radical and subsequent internal H-atom
migration from the adjacent methyl group. This pathway requires
the formation of a seven-membered transition rate that is highly
strained. Nevertheless, it is still a possible route to low temperature
chain propagation, or chain branching intermediates.

PDetailed chemical kinetic models for aromatic fuels are presented
in Table 4. The major focus to date has been on benzene and toluene
models, which are readily adopted into gasoline surrogate kinetic
models. Only a few models exist for the various isomers of xylene
and trimethylbenzene. Indeed, there is a need to develop more
robust kinetic models for larger alkylaromatics in the gasoline boil-
ing point range. A suitable approach for gasoline surrogate kinetic
modeling would be to focus efforts on toluene and 1,2,4-trimethyl-
benzene, because a mixture of these two aromatics can represent
the general functional groups and relative positions of side chains
found in various alkylaromatics hydrocarbons.

P4.1.4. Naphthenes/Cycloalkanes

PThe naphthenic/cycloalkane content of gasoline is typically
below 20 vol%, but may be higher in fuels derived from oil sands and
shale. Their octane quality is typically increased by dehydrogenation
during refining to produce aromatics. Nevertheless, a significant
quantity exists in gasoline fuels, and their presence effects engine
ignition quality and PAH/soot formation.

PCycloalkanes have the same molecular formula as mono-alkenes
with the same carbon number, but their combustion chemistry
is remarkably different. Early studies by Walker et al. [267,268]
showed that oxidation chemistry of cycloalkanes is similar to
that of n-alkanes, although the branching ratios to various low tem-
perature reactive intermediates are considerably different. At high

Ptemperature pyrolytic conditions, cycloalkanes can undergo sequen-
tial dehydrogenation to form aromatic species, which explains their
high sooting tendency. Under high temperature oxidation condi-
tions, cycloalkyl radicals are formed and ring-opening leads to even-
tual formation of dienes.

PThe low temperature oxidation of cycloalkanes proceeds in a
similar manner as discussed earlier for n- and isoalkanes. Cycloalkyl
radicals react with molecular O2 to form alkylperoxy radicals. These
can undergo concerted elimination reactions to form cycloalkenes
and HO2 radicals, or isomerize to QOOH radicals via internal H-
atom migration reactions. QOOH radicals can react again with
molecular O2 and lead to eventual chain branching intermediates
(e.g., ketohydroperoxides). The cycloalkane ring structure takes var-
ious confirmation and introduces steric hindrances. Internal H-atom
migration of alkylperoxy radicals is hindered due to the bicyclic and
highly strained nature of the transition state. Therefore, concerted
elimination reactions leading to radical chain termination are
favored over internal H-atom migration reactions leading to radical
chain branching.

PAs shown previously for n- and isoalkanes, homogeneous batch
reactor ignition delay time simulations can be correlated with fuel
octane numbers. Fig. 29 presents experimental and simulated igni-
tion delay times for C5 and C6 n-alkanes and cycloalkanes. There is a
clear difference in reactivity between n-alkanes and their cycloal-
kane counterparts below 900 K. Yang et al. [269,270] explained that
conformational inhibition of the 1,5 H-atom migration (six-member
ring transition state) chain branching pathway in cyclohexylperoxy
radicals is responsible for their lower reactivity compared to n-hex-
ane. Al Rashidi et al. [271,272] provided a similar explanation for the
lower reactivity of cylopentane compared to n-pentane; they attri-
bute cyclopentane's lower reactivity to higher energy barriers in
forming the strained bicyclic transition state, which increase the flux
to concerted elimination reactions forming unreactive cyclopentene
and HO2 radicals. Methyl substitutions on cycloalkanes (e.g., methyl-
cyclopentane and methylcyclohexane) lower the activation energy
of 1,5 H-atom migration (six-member ring transition state) of cyclo-
alkylperoxy radicals (RO2 D QOOH) [269,270]. Therefore, methylcy-
clopentane and methylcyclohexane are more reactive than their
non-substituted counterparts.

PComprehensive chemical kinetic models for cycloalkanes are pre-
sented in Table 4. To date, most of the kinetic modeling focus has
been on cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane. The recent methylcy-
clohexane kinetic model by Weber et al. [273] has been validated
across a broad range of pressures, temperatures, and mixture frac-
tion conditions; it is recommended for use in gasoline surrogate
kinetic models. Kinetic models for cyclohexane are not as well
developed as those for methylcyclohexane, primarily due to the

Pchallenges in acquiring experimental data. A recent study by
Vranckx et al. [274] measured ignition delay times at 15 bar and
showed NTC behavior in the »700(cid:1)900 K temperature regime,
which indicates complex low temperature oxidation chemistry. The
authors found that current cyclohexane chemical kinetic models
could not accurately capture experimental ignition delay data, and
suggested future work be focused on improving the kinetics of low
temperature oxidation pathways. Only one [271,272,275] compre-
hensive chemical kinetic model with detailed high and low tempera-
ture chemistry exists with cyclopentane. The model was developed
based on theoretical calculations of the cyclopentyl radical decom-
position and oxidation potential energy surfaces and pressure-
dependent kinetics. Additional work is needed to develop a similar
model for methylcyclopentane. Comprehensive and accurate chemi-
cal kinetic models for cyclopentane, methylcyclopentane, cyclohex-
ane, and methylcyclohexane would be sufficient for formulating
gasoline surrogate fuels with various cycloalkane hydrocarbons.

P4.1.5. Olefins/alkenes

POlefins/alkenes represent a small fraction of gasoline fuel, but
they have a notable effect on oxidative stability and autoignition
characteristics. Olefins in gasoline are typically limited to C5(cid:1)(cid:1)C8 lin-
ear and branched hydrocarbons; however, they are also common
intermediates in the oxidation of paraffins, which highlights their
importance in gasoline combustion chemistry. These molecules are
distinguished by the presence of double bonds in the hydrocarbon
structure, which introduces allylic and vinylic hydrogens and reso-
nantly stabilized intermediate radicals. The double bond adds to the
complexity of their oxidation, especially at low temperatures where
radical additions to the double bond are possible. The presence of
olefins in gasoline can change its knocking tendency and soot emis-
sions. Their octane numbers are higher than those of corresponding
paraffins, and the double bond position has a notable effect on anti-
knock quality.

PThe high temperature oxidation (above 1000 K) of olefins is initi-
ated by the abstraction of allylic hydrogen atoms (b to the double
bond), which have lower bond dissociation energies than vinylic and
normal alkylic hydrogen atoms. The resulting allylic radicals exhibit
electron delocalization and are extremely stable due to their reso-
nance structure. These stable allylic radicals can undergo recombina-
tion reactions with other allylic radicals to produce larger chain
hydrocarbons, which can lead to the formation of PAH species. This
explains why alkenes display higher sooting tendencies than alka-
nes. As the carbon chain increases in 1-alkenes, the relative impor-
tance of the double bond on chemical kinetic reactivity decreases.
For example, the reactivity of 1-octene is not significantly different
than n-octane because hydrogen abstraction can proceed from one
of the secondary carbon sites in the alkyl chain. As the double bond
position moves towards the center of a molecule (e.g., 1-alkene to
2-alkene to 3-alkene), it tends to have a greater effect of the overall
reactivity of the molecule. This is attributed to the fact that more
secondary carbon sites are converted to allylic and vinylic sites as
the double bond shifts.

PThe low temperature oxidation (below 1000 K) of alkenes influ-
ences its octane rating in engines [277]. Hydrogen abstraction from
allylic sites becomes more common at lower temperatures due to
the low activation energies. However, H-atom abstraction form nor-
mal secondary carbon sites is also possible, and the resulting allylic
radicals react like those derived from n-alkanes. The subsequent
addition of O2 to the allylic radical is possible, but the resulting RO2
radical is thermodynamically unstable [278]. As a result, subsequent
isomerization and O2 addition reactions leading to chain branching
are hindered. This is the primary reason why alkenes display lower
reactivity [279] and higher octane numbers under low temperature
ignition conditions.

air mixtures). Symbols are experiments and lines are simulations. Figure reproduced
from Mehl et al. [277] with permission from Elsevier Publishing.

PIn addition to H-atom abstraction, OH, H, and HO2 radical addi-
tion to the double bond is possible at very low temperatures (below
700 K). OH radical addition is the most important under typical
engine conditions because OH is the predominant radical at lower
temperatures. Waddington [280(cid:1)282] was the first to show that OH
addition to the double bond of alkenes leads to the formation of
b-hydroxyalkyl radicals. These radicals add O2 to form hydroxyalkyl-
peroxy radicals, which subsequently isomerize and decompose to
form aldehydes and OH radicals.

PFig. 30 from Mehl et al. [277] presents the role of double bond
position on the autoignition of various hexene isomers in the low
temperature oxidation regime. It is clear that alkenes display less
NTC behavior than n-alkanes because the double bonds hinder low
temperature oxidation pathways. NTC behavior becomes less pro-
nounced as the double bond moves towards the interior of the mole-
cule, because the double bond begins influencing a larger number of
possible oxidation pathways. The ignition delay times of 3-hexene is
significantly lower than 1-hexene because the former has two
vinyllic carbon sites, two allylic carbon sites, and two primary car-
bon sites, while the latter has one vinyllic carbon site, one allylic car-
bon site, three secondary carbon sites, and one primary carbon site.
Increasing the number of vinyllic and allylic carbon sites, while
reducing the number of secondary carbon sites, effectively decreases
reactivity, and hence increases octane number.

PComprehensive chemical kinetic models for alkenes are pre-
sented in Table 4. Gasoline typically contains C5(cid:1)(cid:1)C8 alkenes, and
very few comprehensive kinetic models exist in the literature. While
many models are available for high temperature oxidation/pyrolysis
conditions, due to the lack of comprehensive kinetic models for
alkenes, we were unable to find many detailed models covering the
typical temperature and pressure ranges encountered under real
engine condition. Table 4 presents several alkene kinetic models
that have been developed and validated at high temperatures. At
present, it is recommended that 1-hexene be used as a surrogate in
gasoline fuels because it has the most widely validated chemical
kinetic model [277]. Models for other pentenes and hexenes are
valid at high temperatures and should be used only under relevant
combustion conditions. An interesting additive for improving the
octane quality of gasoline is di-isobutylene (DIB), for which a kinetic
model developed by Metcalfe et al. [283] can be used to study DIB
blending effects on ignition quality [164,284].

Pcore mechanism, so that they can be easily merged. Cross-reactions
between fuel components are typically considered in the develop-
ment of these models; however, an extensive analysis and discus-
sion by Battin-Leclerc [233] indicates that such cross-reaction terms
are largely negligible in alkane mixtures, and mildly important in
mixtures containing alkenes and/or aromatics. Indeed, fuel mixtures
behave notably different than pure components, but the cross effects
are realized in species and reactions within the intermediate radical
pool (and rarely with the parent fuel molecules), which highlights
the importance of a robust core mechanism.

PThe mixture of components included in a surrogate fuel kinetic
model is defined based on the selected gasoline target properties, as
described in Section 3. Traditionally, gasoline fuels were modeled as
simple PRF mixtures with n-heptane and isooctane blended to
match either the RON or the MON. However, it was quickly realized
that an additional component(cid:1)mainly an aromatic(cid:1)is needed to
match both the RON and MON, and thus TPRF mixtures became
widely used. More recently, multicomponent mixtures that match
additional gasoline properties (e.g., H/C ratio, average molecular
weight, PIONA, distillation curve, etc.) were utilized to predict more
complex combustion phenomenon. The following sub-sections
describe the formulation of detailed gasoline surrogate chemical
kinetic models. A subset of the models is employed to demonstrate
the effects of surrogate fuel composition on important combustion
properties, such as ignition delay times.

P4.2.1. PRF and TPRF mixtures

PThe introduction of PRF detailed chemical kinetic models dates
back to the late 20th century, when models for the low-temperature
oxidation of n-heptane and isooctane were first developed
[299,332(cid:1)337]. These models were based on fundamental under-
standing of alkane oxidation chemistry proposed by Cox and Cole

P[242]. The primary focus of these PRF models was to understand
autoignition characteristics and engine knock, as the octane rating
methodologies are based on these surrogate mixtures. Morley et al.
[338] and Westbrook et al. [336] were amongst the first to develop
PRF kinetic models and use them to understand the octane ratings of
fuels. The latter team from LLNL typically validated their surrogate
mixture kinetic models against a range of experimental data (igni-
tion delay, flow and stirred reactors, and premixed laminar flame
speeds), which made them widely applicable to predict combustion
phenomenon other than knock-relevant autoignition. More recently,
interest shifted from only modeling PRF surrogates towards devel-
oping models for TPRF mixtures. As mentioned previously, TPRF
mixtures are needed if a surrogate is to match both the RON and the
MON of the target gasoline fuel [70,114].

PTable 5 lists several detailed chemical kinetic models for PRF and
TPRF mixtures. These detailed models are useful for predicting a
wide range of combustion phenomenon, including homogeneous
gas-phase ignition delay, premixed laminar flame propagation, spe-
ciation profiles in reactors, and PAH and soot formation in flames.
These models can also be reduced in complexity (as discussed in the
next section) and used in CFD engine simulations.

PAn example of the predictive capabilities of detailed chemical
kinetic models for PRFs is given here in the context of HCCI engine
simulations. Operation of these engines may be controlled by the
rate of heat release rate (ROHR) of the PRF/air mixture in-cylinder.
Under HCCI conditions, ROHR is a function of the PRF mixture com-
position, equivalence ratio, intake air temperature, and intake air
pressure. A recent experimental HCCI engine study by Vuilleumier
et al. [339] investigated the effect of PRF mixture composition on
ROHR at fixed intake pressure, equivalence ratio, and engine com-
bustion phasing. In this study, numerical HCCI engine simulations
were also performed using a detailed chemical kinetic model for PRF

Pmixtures from LLNL[149]. Both experimental (left panel) and numer-
ical (right panel) results are shown in Fig. 31. The experimental
results show that PRF 100 (pure isooctane) and the mixture with
5 vol% n-heptane (PRF 95) do not show prominent low temperature
heat release (LTHR), which is characterized by the local rise in ROHR
from ¡30 to ¡20 CAD after CA50. The existence of LTHR is due to
low temperature oxidation reactions that lead to radical chain
branching, and the detailed chemical kinetic modeling of PRF100
and PRF95 confirm that such reactions are not important. The lack of
LTHR is attributed to the presence of a large fraction isooctane,
which lacks low temperature reactivity.

PExperimental results indicate that PRF85 with 15 vol% of n-hep-
tane shows significant LTHR. Numerical simulations of PRF85 using
the kinetic model from [149] cannot reproduce the experimentally
observed LTHR behavior. Instead, PRF70 is the highest PRF mixture
that displays LTHR in the numerical simulations. n-Heptane displays
prominent low temperature reactivity due to the large fraction of
CH2 groups, and the magnitude of LTHR is directly proportional to
its amount. A study by Hwang et al. [340] showed similar results, in
which the volume fraction of n-heptane in the PRF simulations had
to be changed to reproduce experimentally observed heat release
characteristics. These results indicate that further work is needed in
PRF kinetic models to improve the prediction of LTHR in HCCI engine
simulations.

PDetailed chemical kinetic models for TPRF mixtures can pre-
dict ignition delay times. Javed et al. [158] measured ignition
delay times of various TPRF mixtures across a range of RON and
S (RON 70, S 4; RON 80, S 5.7; RON 91, S 7.6; and RON 97.5, S
10.9) in both shock tubes and rapid compression machines. The
authors conducted numerical simulations using the detailed
chemical kinetic model from LLNL[149]. The exact mixture com-
positions are present in the original study; briefly, the n-heptane
and isooctane concentrations decrease with increasing RON and
S, while toluene content increases. The experimental and numer-
ical results presented in Fig. 32 show a clear reduction in igni-
tion delay time at intermediate temperatures of »725(cid:1)900 K as
the TPRF number increases. Numerical simulations show that
TPRF70 with the largest fraction of n-heptane has the shortest
ignition delay time due to the low temperature reactivity of n-
heptane, which produces OH radicals required for ignition. As
the toluene fraction increases, the ignition delay time increases
too. As mentioned previously, toluene lacks low temperature
reactivity because it forms stable benzylic radicals, and further
acts as a sink for OH radicals produced by n-heptane in the mix-
ture. The net effect is an overall reduction in the reactivity of the
TPRF mixture. Another interesting observation in experimental

Pand numerical results is the difference in NTC behavior of the
various mixtures. There is a clear change in slope of the ignition
delay time versus temperature curve in the NTC region, as the
TPRF RON and S varies. Further discussion on this behavior is
presented in the following section, within the context of multi-
component gasoline surrogate mixtures.

P4.2.2. Multicomponent mixtures

PGasoline surrogates with more than the typical three compo-
nents (i.e., n-heptane, isooctane, and toluene) are termed multi-
component mixtures. Such mixtures typically include the usual
three components and additional components needed to replicate
various target fuel properties. Important properties that require the
addition of more components in the surrogate mixture include dis-
tillation curve, functional group or hydrocarbon class distribution,
average molecular weight, and octane sensitivity. Real gasoline fuels
have a broad distillation profile, which PRF and TPRF mixtures can-
not replicate. Therefore, surrogates should include components that
cover the entire boiling point range of typical gasoline fuels. Real
gasolines also often contain naphthenes, olefins, and oxygenates,
none of which are found in PRF and TPRF mixtures. If a surrogate is

tified by its RON (97.5, 91, 80, 70). Figure taken from Javed et al. [158] and reproduced

Pto match the hydrocarbon class distribution and functional groups of
the real fuel, then molecules representing all hydrocarbon classes
should be included in the surrogate.

PA summary of multicomponent gasoline surrogate detailed
chemical kinetic models is presented in Table 5. The largest detailed
chemical kinetic model for gasoline surrogates is currently available
from Reaction Design and contains up to 20 components [341(cid:1)343].
These include various hydrocarbons in the gasoline boiling point
range as well as ethanol. The chemical kinetic model is utilized in
Reaction Design's Surrogate Blend Optimizer [343], which formu-
lates surrogates to match desired target properties of a real fuel.
Puduppakam et al. [341] and Naik et al. [343] have shown that the
species palette can be successfully utilized to create surrogate mix-
tures of various complexity, which replicate real gasoline fuel prop-
erties. The chemical kinetic model is large in size, so mechanism
reduction is applied, and then CFD multi-zone engine simulations
are conducted to predict important engine performance parameters.
PThe team at LLNL [112,149] has worked for many years on multi-
component kinetic surrogate models for gasoline fuels. These
include mixtures of n-heptane, isooctane, and toluene with various
alkenes (1-hexene and/or 2-pentene). The models are developed on
the C0-C4 base chemistry from NUIG [219(cid:1)222], which facilitates
the addition of new components as kinetic models become available.
Recently, LLNL, NUIG, and KAUST collaborated [58,150] to develop a
gasoline surrogate kinetic model comprising 10 components with
representatives from each of the major hydrocarbon classes. The
kinetic model was used to simulate the ignition characteristics of
FACE (fuels for advanced combustion engines) gasolines by the for-
mulation of multicomponent surrogates that match various target
properties (distillation curve, H/C ratio, octane number, PIONA,
carbon types, and average molecular weight) [125]. The authors
showed that ignition simulations with simpler PRF and TPRF surro-
gate for FACE gasolines can reproduce experimentally measured
ignition delay times of the real gasoline at high temperatures. How-
ever, at low and intermediate temperatures, the authors found that
simulations using multicomponent surrogates better replicate the
ignition characteristics of the real fuels [58,150]. The 10-component
model has also been used to simulate surrogate mixtures of high
octane oxygenated gasolines containing ethanol [154] and low
octane gasolines produced from light and heavy naphtha [152,153a].
PTo further understand the role of surrogate fuel composition on
ignition characteristics, Singh et al. [344] measure the RON and
MON of various multicomponent mixtures comprising n-heptane,
isooctane, toluene, 1-hexene, and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene. They
showed that increasing the aromatic and olefin content in the mix-
ture resulted in higher octane sensitivity. Furthermore, the authors
utilized chemical kinetic simulations with the KAUST-LLNL(cid:1)NUIG
gasoline surrogate kinetic model [58,150] under homogeneous con-
ditions to correlate ignition delay times with RON and MON. Fig. 33
presents a portion of the results from Singh et al. [344] for surrogate
fuel mixtures listed in Table 6. All fuels covered have the same RON
with varying levels of sensitivity and differing mixture composition.
The goal of presenting this subset of fuels is to clarify the effects of
mixture composition on octane sensitivity.

PAs shown in Fig. 33, all mixtures have similar ignition delay times
at high temperatures (above 900 K), indicating that fuel composition

25 bar and stoichiometric fuel/air mixtures. Legend denotes the mixtures RON and

ican Chemical Society.

Pdoes not significantly affect reactivity at these conditions. At low
and intermediate temperatures there are notable differences in igni-
tion delay times for the different mixtures; however, the effect of
fuel composition on ignition delay time varies depending on the spe-
cific temperature regime. An interesting observation is that near
»750 K, all the mixtures have the same ignition delay time, suggest-
ing a strong correlation between RON and ignition delay time and
this temperature (recall that all fuels are RON 91).

PThe qualitative variation of ignition delay time with temperature
is indicative of the octane sensitivity of the mixture. The simplest
surrogate presented is PRF 91 with a RON of 91 and zero sensitivity.
The simulated ignition delay times of this fuel display significant
NTC characteristics. Below »750 K, PRF91 has the shortest ignition
delay time, but above »750 K it has the longest ignition delay time.
This prominent NTC behavior is indicative of non-sensitive fuel
[345]. Surrogate mixtures with increasing sensitivity show longer
ignition delay times below »750 K and shorter ignition delay times
above »750 K. Essentially, the NTC characteristic of the mixture is
diminished as the octane sensitivity increases.

PThese phenomena can be directly linked to fuel composition.
PRF91 is a purely paraffinic fuel that shows prominent low tempera-
ture radical chain branching chemistry below »750 K, but as the
temperature increases, competing chain propagating and chain ter-
minating reactions inhibit reactivity,
leading to the observed
NTC behavior. Higher sensitivity mixtures contain larger fractions
of aromatics and olefins, both of which contain carbon-carbon
double bonds. These mixtures still include a significant amount of
n-heptane, which undergoes radical chain branching reactions at
low temperatures below »750 K. However, the formed radicals reac-
tion with the aromatics and/or olefins form resonantly stabilized

Pintermediates, which do not lead to low temperature radical chain
branching. As the temperature increases above »750 K, n-heptane
reacts to form HO2 radicals (as opposed to OH radical), due to con-
certed elimination reactions; however, these HO2 radicals can read-
ily react with benzyl radicals to form OH and benzoxyl radicals
[161]. The production of OH radicals by these pathways results in a
higher sensitivity fuel (i.e., higher aromatic content), having shorter
ignition delay times in the intermediate temperature regime.

PIn summary, kinetic modeling simulations with multicomponent
surrogate mixtures give deeper insight into the effects of molecular
composition on important gasoline combustion properties, such as
ignition delay. Novel gasoline engine technologies that rely on strati-
fied or partially premixed charges may also be increasingly sensitive
to physical properties of the gasoline fuel, such as density, viscosity,
and distillation profile. Complex surrogate mixtures are typically
needed to match the entire boiling point range of real gasoline
fuels. Additional research will determine the required complexity of
gasoline surrogates needed to replicate coupled chemical kinetic
phenomenon (i.e., gas-phase reactivity) and physically driven phe-
nomenon (i.e., mixture formation, spray characteristics, etc.).

5. Summary and outlook

PGrowing global demand for transportation is increasing the need
for gasoline fuels. It is expected that gasoline fuels will be widely
used in both SI and CI engines, with various fundamental research
topics requiring attention. This review demonstrates the need for a
fundamental understanding of gasoline combustion characteristics
to overcome the challenges limiting the development of advanced
gasoline engine technologies. These included, but were not limited
to, mitigation of knock and superknock in SI engines, robust ignition
and combustion control of gasoline in CI engines, and mitigation of
harmful pollutant emissions. These practical engine phenomena
were shown to be linked to several fundamental combustion proper-
ties, such as ignition delay time, laminar flame speed, heat release
rates, and species formation. The development of surrogate mix-
tures, together with corresponding experimental and theoretical
studies on gasoline fuels and their surrogates, were comprehen-
sively discussed in this work.

PDespite recent advances in our understanding of gasoline surro-
gate fuel formulation, experimental measurements and chemical
kinetic modeling, this review identifies areas where significant
research advances are required to overcome challenges facing the
development of high efficiency and low emission gasoline engines.
This review identifies an overarching fuel-engine design methodol-
ogy that has evolved in recent decades. The general design process
presented in Fig. 1 shows how fuels and engines can be optimized to
maximize efficiency and decrease negative environmental impacts.
Current challenges in the design process are highlighted in the fol-
lowing discussion, while future research directions are provided in
Box 1.

PThe first step is to gain detailed knowledge of gasoline fuel
production and engine technologies. The combustion characteris-
tics of gasoline strongly depend on the type of crude oil, the
refining process, and the blending of petroleum derived fuels
with bio-derived components. The fuels must be well character-
ized, using not only standard ASTM or EN test methodologies,
but also more advanced molecular characterization techniques.
Technologies already exist to perform fuel production and char-
acterization measurements needed for the proposed design pro-
cess; but, improved simulation tools are needed to predict fuel
properties based on production processes.

PWith a sound understanding of the physical-chemical character-
istics of a gasoline fuel, the second step is to generate surrogate
mixtures comprising a limited number of components. As shown in

Pthis review, this can be readily achieved using computational tools
to match a range of gasoline fuel target properties. The primary
challenge remains, wherein determining the important target prop-
erties requires detailed knowledge of the engine combustion pro-
cess. Therefore, a systematic study is needed to determine the
relationship between various physical(cid:1)chemical target properties
and their impact on combustion processes in a specific engine
hardware.

POnce a surrogate is defined, it should be tested in fundamental
combustion devices alongside the real gasoline fuel. As shown in
this review, experiments in high pressure ignition devices, flow reac-
tors, and laminar flames provide detailed insights into gasoline com-
bustion chemistry. Despite the large amount of data available, there
is a dearth of experimental measurements on complex mixtures
comprising more than two or three surrogate molecules. Such infor-
mation is needed for the development of kinetic models and under-
standing mixture effects. This leads to the fourth step in the design
process: developing a surrogate chemical kinetic model. This review
has shown that chemical kinetic models are available for many gaso-
line relevant moelcules, but better models are still needed for
cycloalkanes (naphthenes) and alkenes (olefins). Furthermore, the
development of kinetic models for gasoline mixtures with many
components is required.

PThe present review provides a detailed overview of steps one
through four; and it has been shown that understanding complex
gasoline fuel properties on combustion processes can help predict
important phenomenon, such as heat release rates in advanced com-
bustion engines and octane rating. However, significantly more
research is needed to extend this approach to realistic engine envi-
ronments. The sixth step in the design process requires translating
the fundamental knowledge of gasoline combustion into complex
engine hardware environments. Under such conditions, spray pro-
cesses and mixing act together with gas-phase chemistry to control
the combustion process. While many studies from engine literature
have interpreted fuel/engine interactions, this review identifies a
scarcity in the use of multi-component surrogates in engine
research. The use of these complex surrogates in engine experiments
and numerical simulations can help develop a more detailed under-
standing of gasoline fuel/engine interactions.

PFinally, an important aspect of the design process is a fundamen-
tal understanding of fuel/engine combustion processes, emissions,
and environmental impact. A large amount of experimental litera-
ture (e.g., [354,355]) already exists to study the link between fuels,
combustion emissions (i.e., soot, NOx, etc.) and environmental
impact. However, an implementation of this knowledge into the
design process requires large-scale computational simulations,
which predict the effects of combustion emissions on regional and
global air quality [356(cid:1)358]. This realization of this framework can
lead to new opportunities of designing optimal fuel/engine technol-
ogies with maximum efficiency and minimal environmental impact.

BOX 1 - Future directions for gasoline surrogate formulation
research

P(cid:4) Insights into the relationship between gasoline composition
and engine performance are achieved by studying surrogate
mixtures in fundamental experiments. However,
these
experiments must be designed to investigate engine-rele-
vant phenomenon. The fuel effects of on pre-ignition and
super-knock can be better understood with fundamental
experiments in ST and RCM. Recent work [132,359(cid:1)361] has
shown that ignition in these devices is not always homoge-
neous, and phenomenon such as early flame development
and transition to detonation can be studied in ST and RCM.

P(cid:4) Spray combustion devices such as constant volume combus-
tion chambers (CVCC) and ignition quality testers (IQT) have
been extensively used to study diesel spray combustion
[207,362(cid:1)365], but only a few studies exist on gasoline fuels
[366,367]. Research should be directed towards acquiring
liquid spray and combustion data for various gasoline fuels,
surrogate mixtures, and injector geometries. This would also
facilitate the development of high-fidelity spray combustion
simulations.

P(cid:4) This review identified a lack of kinetic modeling validation
data for practical gasoline fuels and multicomponent surro-
gate mixtures. Laminar flame speed measurements are
needed at higher pressures (up to 30 bar) and unburnt gas
temperatures (400(cid:1)600 K). Total and first stage ignition
delay time measurements at higher pressures (up to
100 bar) and lower temperatures (550(cid:1)950 K) are required
to validate kinetic models in the low temperature and NTC
regimes. Speciation measurements in flames and flow reac-
tors have been largely restricted to higher temperatures and
lower pressures. Therefore, efforts are needed to better cap-
ture combustion intermediates at elevated pressures (>
1 bar) and low- to intermediate- temperatures (550(cid:1)950 K).
In particular, measurements are needed to understand mix-
ture effects on oxidation intermediates in the low tempera-
ture regime and particulate matter formation at higher
pressures.

P(cid:4) Engines experiments with multi-component surrogate mix-
tures are needed. These experiments should use the same
surrogate mixtures as those used in fundamental devices (e.
g., ST, RCM, flames), so a link can be established between
fundamental and applied combustion systems. In addition,
engine experiments with surrogate fuels will improve the
accuracy of CFD engine simulations by removing uncertain-
ties in the modeling of fully blended gasoline fuels.

P(cid:4) Chemical kinetic models for various gasoline surrogate com-
ponents have advanced significantly in the last decade. How-
ever, consistency in thermochemical and kinetic rate
parameters is currently limited to n-alkane models, and sig-
nificant work is needed to improve kinetic models for other
Improved models for C6(cid:1)(cid:1)C8 isoalkanes,
hydrocarbons.
C6(cid:1)(cid:1)C8 cycloalkanes, and C7(cid:1)(cid:1)C9 aromatics are needed. Fur-
thermore, kinetic models capable of simulations multicom-
ponent mixtures (e.g., up to ten components) will be useful
for determining if and when complex surrogate mixtures are
needed.

P(cid:4) Engine combustion is governed by complex physical (e.g.,
droplet breakup, spray evaporation, air/fuel mixing) and
chemical (e.g., gas-phase chemical reactions) processes, but
it is often difficult to decouple fuel property effects, espe-
cially in new combustion concept engines [368,369]. Surro-
gate fuel mixtures offer an opportunity to study these
processes separately. For example, mixtures with similar
physical properties but widely varying chemical kinetic
properties (e.g., various isomers of octane) could be investi-
gated.

P(cid:4) Reduced mechanisms are regularly published to simulation
gasoline surrogate mixture combustion in engines [370,371].
However, the release of reduced models often cannot keep
up with the pace of advances in detailed chemical kinetic
models. Therefore, new open-source model reduction tools
should be developed to enable use of the latest detailed
chemical kinetic models in CFD simulations.

P(cid:4) Research has been conducted on non-oxygenated gasoline
fuels and their surrogates, but few fundamental studies exist
on the effects of various additives to gasoline fuels. Common

Pantiknock additives, such as ethanol and MTBE, have been
studied in engines, but the underlying chemical kinetic
mechanisms contributing to their improved antiknock qual-
ity could be better investigated in fundamental devices.
Indeed, it is widely known that blending octane numbers of
additives (e.g., ethanol [118,372(cid:1)374]) vary depending on
base fuel octane number and composition. However, theo-
retical explanations and models capable of prediction blend-
ing octane can only be achieved by detailed studies with
surrogate mixtures. These studies could improve the design
of higher efficiency octane on demand technologies.

P(cid:4) Finally, a cradle-to-grave approach for gasoline fuel develop-
ment research is needed. The environmental impact of new
gasoline fuel production technologies as well as improve-
ments in end-use engine technologies need to be analyzed
and optimized together. Surrogate fuel mixtures are neces-
sary for developing complex models to simulate fuel produc-
tion, combustion, and environmental fate. Systems wide
studies [375(cid:1)378] on net CO2 emissions and other environ-
mental indicators offers the potential for optimal fuel/engine
design.
