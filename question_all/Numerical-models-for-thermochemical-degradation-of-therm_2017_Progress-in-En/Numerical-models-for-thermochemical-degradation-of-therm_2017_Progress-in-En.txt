This paper reviews the current state-of-the-art of numerical models used for thermochemical degradation
and combustion of thermally thick woody biomass particles. The focus is on the theory of drying, devolatili-
zation and char conversion with respect to their implementation in numerical simulation tools. An intro-
duction to wood chemistry, as well as the physical characteristics of wood, is also given in order to facilitate
the discussion of simplifying assumptions in current models. Current research on single, densified or non-
compressed, wood particle modeling is presented, and modeling approaches are compared. The different
modeling approaches are categorized by the dimensionality of the model (1D, 2D or 3D), and the one-
dimensional models are separated into mesh-based and interface-based models. Additionally, the applica-
bility of the models for wood stoves is discussed, and an overview of the existing literature on numerical
simulations of small-scale wood stoves and domestic boilers is given. Furthermore, current bed modeling
approaches in large-scale grate furnaces are presented and compared against single particle models.

1. Introduction

PCurrently, intense research is concentrated on the thermal con-
version of biomass, which is due to the more attractive character of
biomass compared to traditional fossil fuels for technologies based
on thermal conversion, such as combustion [1]. The superiority of
biomass-based technologies compared to fossil fuel technologies is
related to the environmentally friendly character of botanic biomass,
also including lignocellulosic biomass. A plant can only release the
carbon dioxide (while burning) that it has stored during growth. The
net CO2 emission is therefore zero, making biomass carbon-neu-
tral [2]. Hence, more research within the field of thermal conversion
of biomass can contribute significantly to a sustainable energy mix.

PBiomass combustion is one of the main routes of biomass conver-
sion [3]. Different combustion technologies require differently sized
lignocellulosic biomass particles [4]. Wood pellets, logs and chips
are usually used, and are considered to be thermally thick par-
ticles [5]. When modeling thermally thick wood particles, heat and
mass transport have to be considered. Overall, there is a large differ-
ence between thermally thin and thermally thick particles, which is
classified by the Biot (Bi) number. The Biot number is defined as [6]

effective heat transfer coefficient (heff) are used. The Biot number
defines the ratio between heat transfer resistance in the interior of
the particle and at the surface of the particle [7]. For low Biot num-
bers ( < 0.1), a thermally thin regime is present, whereas large Biot
numbers ( > 0.1) indicate the presence of a thermally thick
regime [8]. In thermally thick particles, intra-particle gradients of
temperature are important [9]. Due to varying temperatures, differ-
ent conversion stages occur simultaneously within the wood log or
particle, and intra-particle transport phenomena also have to be

Pconsidered. In contrast, thermally thin particles have a uniform
temperature distribution. This results in sequential conversion
stages [10]. Independent of the applied combustion technology, the
conversion steps that occur during combustion are drying, devolati-
lization and char burnout.

PIn addition to the fundamental research on thermal conversion of
biomass particles, the application of the corresponding models to
wood-fired boilers and stoves has recently been intensively studied.
The main aim of current research is to improve the combustion pro-
cess with the aid of modeling tools to help yield an improved design
and operation of boilers or stoves. Improvement is required since
emissions of carbon monoxide, particulates, organic pollutants such
as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), soot and nitrogen oxides
of current small-scale units may be very high [11]. Furthermore, the
use of bioenergy will increase in the future, thereby highlighting the
importance of optimized stove and boiler designs [12]. In Norway
today, domestic heating applications such as wood stoves account
for almost 50% of bioenergy use, and the use of wood logs in small-
scale units, as well as the utilization of pellets in pellet stoves and
boilers, is predicted to increase even further. The Norwegian objec-
tive is to increase the rate of energy conversion in wood and pellet
stoves by a factor of 2 from 2008 until 2020 [13]. The need for opti-
mization of wood log fired stoves is due to decreasing emission
limits and changing market demands [14]. Modern simulation tech-
niques, such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD), are an efficient
way to reach these objectives [14]. CFD for the optimization of com-
bustion systems is considered an alternative way of improvement
(compared to experiments) that is usually less expensive [15]. Even
though numerical simulations are a more time-saving and less
expensive optimization route, experiments are needed for the vali-
dation of models applied [12].

PIn order to apply commercial CFD tools, numerical sub-models
have to be developed [15]. The sub-models aim to fully describe the
thermal conversion of the solid fuel, and eventually link these results

Pto gas phase modeling, which is commonly performed with com-
mercial CFD tools. It is of importance to develop numerical models
for drying, devolatilization and char burnout of wood particles that
optimize the balance between the degree of accuracy and the
required computational time [10]. Both aspects need to be consid-
ered when the purpose is to apply the model as an engineering tool
for the optimization of wood heating appliances.

PCurrently, most of the research within the field of CFD-aided
design and optimization of biomass combustion units is restricted to
large-scale biomass fixed bed and grate furnace applications. Only a
few works have been done on CFD models for wood log combustion
in domestic heating appliances [14]. In this work, the domestic scale
is limited to 30 kW, which is more accurately rather micro-scale
than small-scale, but is referred to as small-scale in this review. This
review focuses in part on such domestic applications, but further
also discusses current single particle models. The third part of the
paper focuses on large-scale grate furnaces and the corresponding
bed models. With respect to large-scale grate furnaces, it is outlined
how currently applied bed models are simplified when compared to
detailed single-particle models. While large-scale grate furnaces
have a moving bed and the fuel is transported through the furnace
while undergoing different stages of conversion, the previously dis-
cussed domestic heating applications have a fixed bed, e.g. wood
stoves.

PThe current state-of-the-art

large-scale grate furnace
design and optimization is that also within this field furnace
design is primarily based on experience or empirical data. How-
ever, experiments are difficult and expensive, which highlights
the necessity for a CFD analysis [16]. CFD also gains increasing
importance within this field, due to the constant improvement of
computer performance [17]. Despite this increasing importance,
simplifications are still needed in order to make large-scale grate
furnace modeling affordable [16].

PThe purpose of this review is to convey theoretical knowl-
edge of physical and chemical phenomena related to the thermal
conversion of woody biomass. The focus is on drying, devolatili-
zation and char conversion of thermally thick wood particles
(incl. logs). The aim is to discuss current modeling approaches
for single particles in detail, and to identify their strengths and
weaknesses.

PA number of reviews on thermochemical degradation of wood
and related physical processes is already available. The current
review does not only cover chemical and physical processes
modeling for single particle applications but also discusses mod-
els for the solid phase that can be applied in small-scale heating
appliances as well as large-scale furnaces. Anca-Couce [18] pre-
sented an extensive review on pyrolysis of wood and related
chemical and also partly physical processes. The full thermal
conversion of particles though has not been reviewed. Further-
more, no direct linkage between the single particle models and
how solid phase is modeled in small-scale heating appliances
has been discussed. A detailed review on pyrolysis of biomass
was also presented by Neves et al. [19]. The focus was on factors
influencing secondary pyrolysis of gases and the product distri-
bution and composition. Furthermore an empirical model for the
volatile composition was presented. Di Blasi [20] reviewed litera-
ture on modeling of chemical and physical processes of wood
during pyrolysis. Primary devolatilization kinetics were discussed
in detail, as well as secondary reaction modeling approaches.
They also reviewed pyrolysis reactor models, even though they
found that only very limited work had been done in that field.
Fixed-bed reactors and fast-pyrolysis reactors were included in
their review. However, no review on stove models was per-
formed and we also found that a significant amount of work has
been done since Di Blasi’s review [20] in 2008.

PThe purpose of the small-scale furnace modeling section is to
review the current state-of-the-art, and to identify which modeling
aspects need more attention. The purpose of the large-scale grate
furnace section is to outline how current bed models for grate furna-
ces deviate from single particle models. Such deviation is due to the
complexity of large-scale grate furnaces, which requires simplifying
assumptions in order to operate at a reasonable computational cost.

2. Chemistry of woody biomass

PWood is classified as lignocellulosic biomass, and can be split into
hardwood and softwood [21]. Table 1 outlines the composition of
typical Scandinavian wood species.

PIn Table 1, fractions of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose are
presented for some woody biomasses. Lignocellulose describes
three-dimensional composites of polymeric substructures, and is
primarily composed of lignin, a phenolic polymer, as well as car-
bohydrate macromolecules, namely cellulose and hemicellulose.
Besides these main compounds, small percentages of proteins,
acids, salts and minerals are also identified in lignocellulosic
feedstock [24].

PLignin is the natural binding material in the cell walls of lignocel-
lulosic plants [22]. It is amorphous, and its units are randomly
linked [18]. Lignin is a co-polymer, including three types of phenyl-
propane monomeric units, which are p-coumaryl, coniferyl and
sinapyl alcohols [25]. Lignin varies with respect to its O, C and H
composition, and can therefore be either hydrogen-rich, carbon-rich
or oxygen-rich [26]. As it is later outlined, such a detailed classifica-
tion of lignin is only used by Ranzi et al. [27] for developing a
detailed devolatilization reaction model. However, a detailed
description of the reacting fuel is required if the purpose of the
model is to accurately predict volatile species and their release rates.
PCell walls mainly contain cellulose [22]. The cellulose content
in wood can vary depending on the age of the plant, as well as
the plant type. Cellulose is built up by linear chains of 1,4-
b-bonded anhydroglucose units. These units contain OH-groups,
which form hydrogen bonds inside the macromolecule. Not only
do these bonds connect within one macromolecule, but they also
link different macromolecules [28]. Cellulose molecules are char-
acterized by their linearity, which is one of the primary differen-
ces compared to hemicellulose and lignin. The degree of
polymerization, describing the number of sub-units forming the
entire polymer of cellulose ( > 10000), is much higher than for
hemicellulose (20(cid:1)500) [22].

PHemicellulose is the third main component forming cell walls.
It is less linear than cellulose, and has a more branch-like char-
acter [22]. In hardwoods, the main hemicellulose macromolecule
is methylglucuronxylan [29]. This differs from hemicellulose
macromolecules found in softwood, which are mainly built up
by galactoglucomannan and arabinomethylglucuronoxylan [29].
Therefore, reaction schemes in case of thermal degradation for

Pthese two types of hemicellulose also differ. Modeling hemicellu-
lose in hardwood is often done by modeling the chemical charac-
teristics of xylan [26].

POne can clearly see that wood is a mixture of many components,
and an accurate description of
its devolatilization accordingly
includes numerous reactions. Such a broad range of reactions
increases both the complexity of the model and the computational
cost, since reactions will be of different stiffnesses, which require
finer temporal resolution. Simplifying assumptions are therefore
needed, which can be either modeling wood as a mixture of all com-
ponents, or modeling cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin separately.
Both modeling approaches have their strengths and weaknesses,
which are discussed in a later chapter.

3. Physical characteristics of woody biomass

PWoody biomass particles vary significantly in their physical char-
acteristics. Table 2 illustrates the major differences between wood
logs and densified wood particles, which can both be categorized as
thermally thick woody particles.

PPellets are compressed biomass particles made from pulverized
biomass, either with or without additives (binder). The shape is
most commonly cylindrical and the particles have a length of
5(cid:1)40 mm [31].

PThe allowed diameter for wood logs is rather narrow for birch
wood with a nice appearance (8(cid:1)15 cm), as suggested by the Norwe-
gian quality standard for firewood [32]. For other wood species,
including birch, oak, ash and maple (hardwoods), the minimum
diameter is 4 cm, while the maximum diameter is 18 cm. This diam-
eter range is applicable to almost all wood species, whereas the cor-
responding standard lengths of the wood logs vary between 20, 30
and 60 cm.

PPellets and briquettes have a lower water content than wood
logs. More specifically, both wood pellets and briquettes typically
have an average water content of approximately 8wt% on wet basis,
even though bark briquettes can also have a higher water content
(18wt% on wet basis). This variation in water content has an effect
on net calorific value, combustion efficiency and temperature of
combustion [30]. In contrast to densified wood, freshly harvested
wood has a higher water content. However, small-scale units can
only operate sufficiently well if the moisture content does not
exceed a critical value, and wood logs should be used with a water
content that is not higher than 12(cid:1)20wt% wet basis [23].

PA primary difference between wood pellets and wood logs is the
density, which for wood pellets is commonly assumed to be about
twice as high (1100 kg/m3) as the density of wood logs (500 kg/
m3) [1]. It has to be added though that especially the wood species
significantly affects the density of undensified wood. In addition to
the variation in densities, wood pellets are also often considered iso-
tropic, while wood logs are considered anisotropic [1]. Wood is
formed by elongated cells, whose walls are formed by micro-fibrils
aligned along the longitudinal axis of the cell [22]. These fundamen-
tals of the wood structure explain the naturally anisotropic proper-
ties of wood. Therefore, e.g. the thermal conductivity of wood is
smaller in the radial and the tangential direction to the grains

Pcompared to the longitudinal direction [33]. Due to the analogies
between heat and mass transfer, similar behavior is expected for
permeabilities. The anisotropy of wood also affects shrinkage during
drying and devolatilization. The highest degree of shrinkage occurs
tangentially to the grains, which means in the direction of annual
growth rings. Radial shrinkage is only half of tangential shrinkage
but is still more significant than longitudinal shrinkage [33].

PThese physical differences between undensified and densified
wood particles highlights that simplifying assumptions, required for
modeling, have to be applied with caution as they might be suitable
for describing pellets and briquettes, e.g. isotropy, but can lead to
false predictions, when applied to undensified particles.

4. Particle degradation modeling

PNew modeling approaches for drying, devolatilization and char
conversion of single wood particles and logs are continuously being
developed. There is a vast variety of such models, and there may be
large differences between them. The differences are primarily due to
the simplifying assumptions that have been made. The purpose of
the subsequent comparison is to outline the differences between
current models, and to identify their strengths and weaknesses. The
comparison of models in Table 3 is for thermally thick particles only.
PTable 3 shows that a number of models only include certain
stages of thermal conversion (e.g. only drying and devolatilization,
while neglecting char conversion), instead of modeling the entire
thermal conversion process. This can lead to inaccuracies if the pur-
pose of the model is to predict overall conversion times and product
yields, rather than only developing a model for the fundamental
research on a certain conversion stage, since the conversion stages
have an influence on each another.

PThe heating rate affecting the wood particle during thermal con-
version has a signficant influence on the devolatilization product
yields. At lower heating rates, more char is produced, while at higher
heating rates depolymerization of the wood compounds to perma-
nent gases and tar is enhanced [65]. This fundamental understanding
of product yields was used by Pozzobon et al. [62] to outline how
evaporation can influence char conversion. Pozzobon et al. [62]
found that the char yield is largest at intermediate moisture con-
tents. This is related to the fact that at very low moisture contents
(about 1wt%), drying does not slow down the overall heating up sig-
nificantly, such that char formation is not significantly enhanced,
while it is enhanced at an intermediate moisture content (9wt%). At
a moisture content of 50wt%, it was found that char yield decreases
again. This is because water vapor is formed, which leaves via the
porous structure of wood and char, and hereby heterogeneously
reacts with char, such that the char yield decreases [62]. Nothing
comparable has been found in earlier works, which again highlights
that an accurate thermal conversion model of a thermally thick par-
ticle has to account for all three main conversion stages simulta-
neously, as they significantly influence one another.

PWith respect to Table 3, it has to be mentioned that some of the
models have been applied to packed-bed modeling. However, they
were added to the table if their single particle models were sepa-
rately validated. It is therefore assumed that these single particle

Pmodels can also be used to model single particles alone, as only
boundary conditions have to be adjusted accordingly.

PMoreover, it has to be added that independent of the choice of
single particle model, the validation of models against experiments is
very challenging due to various reasons [40]. The first problem is that
chosen properties can vary a lot, and also show a significant depen-
dency on wood species. Furthermore, the values for the properties of
charred and partially charred solids are related to a significant uncer-
tainty. The values of properties of the solid then also have to take
into consideration the structural changes (e.g. cracking, fragmenta-
tion) and shrinkage that can occur during the entire thermal conver-
sion process. It is also not possible to know the detailed chemical
composition of each wood particle modeled. This is because the
same sample cannot be produced twice, since it is expected that
there always is a small variation in the percentage of contributing
cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin fractions. Inorganic matter that is
contained in the experimental wood sample, and which catalyzes
primary devolatilization, is often not taken into consideration in
modeling applications. Finally, the influence of chosen kinetic data is
related to uncertainty, since the kinetic models themselves are also a
gross simplification. In addition, the obtained kinetics are restricted
to the operational conditions for which they were derived [40].

PThe models listed in Table 3 are of different complexity. The two
most simplified models [49,59] in Table 3, were primarily based on
pre-defined temperatures and geometrical relations. To a certain
extent, they were based on interfaces moving through the wood par-
ticle, even though they included a higher number of simplifying
assumptions compared to the rest of the listed interface-based mod-
els. Models of medium complexity listed in Table 3 are the interface-
based models, where conversion fronts move through the particle
from the surface to the center, and the highest complexity is related
to the very detailed mesh-based models, where the full single parti-
cle is discretized. Nonetheless, more details on mesh-based and
interface-based models are mentioned in the following sections.
With respect to Table 3, however, it must be pointed out that,
depending on the purpose of a model, simplistic models can be more
suitable than very comprehensive mesh-based models. Even though
mesh-based models result in higher accuracy, they might not be
suitable for certain purposes (e.g. as a fast and simple engineering
tool) due to increased computational cost.

4.1. Evolution equations

PA model’s accuracy and complexity increase with increasing
detail in the mathematical description of physical and chemical pro-
cesses. Therefore, the relevant evolution equations for thermochem-
ical wood degradation and combustion modeling need to be
discussed.

PAs shown in Fig. 1, the wood volume is formed by a solid matrix,
and embedded in this solid matrix there are openings (pores) that
contain gas and liquid phase. The dimensions of these pores can vary
quite a bit. Pore size distribution, and consequently the overall
porosity of wood, influence mass and heat transfer, which conse-
quently affects thermal degradation [66]. This combined structure of
solid matrix and gas- or liquid-filled pores leads to the assumption
that wood can be described as a porous medium.

PBased on the structure of wood, the describing equations need to
include the influence of all current phases. Given the porous multi-
phase structure of wood, the evolution equation for temperature is
given by

Fig. 1. Wood as a porous medium. The lined areas illustrate the solid phase (marked
with s), the crossed areas are occupied by the liquid phase (marked with l) and the
plain white areas illustrate areas where the gas phase (marked with g) is present. The
pores themselves can contain both liquid and gas phase. The circle illustrates a certain
representative sub-volume of the entire wood log.

Pwhere the subscripts s, l and g refer to the solid, the liquid and
the gas phase, respectively. In the case of ongoing devolatiliza-
tion reactions in a thermally thick particle, the solid phase
includes the virgin wood as well as the produced char. During
the stage of char conversion, char and ash form the solid phase.
The effective thermal conductivity, keff, includes the influence of
virgin wood, char, free liquid and bound water, in addition to
gases. A linear variation of thermal conductivity from virgin
wood to char, based on the degree of conversion, is commonly
assumed [22,34,36(cid:1)40,42,43,54,55,58,61]. A general assumption
is that material properties vary linearly from virgin wood to
char, and this does not solely apply to thermal conductivity, but
also to specific heat capacity and permeability. The last three
terms on the right-hand-side of the equation are source and sink
terms due to the heat of reactions of drying, devolatilization and
char conversion. The specific heat capacities are given by cP,
i,
where subscript i represents the phase, which can be either for
solid (s), liquid (l), bound (b) or gas phase (g), respectively. One
of the major simplifying assumptions that has been used in
obtaining Eq. (2), and which is also applied by many research-
ers [1,7,10,22,34(cid:1)43,45(cid:1)55,57(cid:1)62,64], is the assumption of ther-
mal equilibrium between all the phases (solid, liquid and gas).

PLarge Peclet numbers, defined as

Pe 1⁄4 durcp

ð3Þ

for heat transfer [67] justify the simplifying assumption of a local
thermal equilibrium. Here, d is the characteristic length, u is the
velocity, r is the density, λ is the thermal conductivity and cP is
the specific heat capacity. The Peclet number is the ratio of convec-
tive and diffusive transport. The assumption of thermal equilibrium
reduces the number of required temperature equations to one,
and consequently reduces the computational cost. Some deviation
between modeling results and experimental results can be due to
this assumption [68,69], as it results in longer conversion times,
which increase by approximately 20%, compared to the case where
separate temperature equations are solved for each phase.

PSome authors neglect convection in the porous structure [48,64].
It has to be mentioned, however, that the gas phase that is flowing
through the pores will result in a cooling of the solid particle, and
that this effect cannot be modeled accurately if convection is
neglected. Neglecting the convection should actually be considered

Pas a gross over-simplification because it is known that a high gas
flow along the grain direction can limit the heating rate, and
accordingly the entire temperature evolution is closely coupled
to the gas flow within the pores. Another consequence is that a
slower heating of the wood log, due to high gas flows out of the
wood log center, yields different product yields and also gives a
different conversion time comparable to what is obtained when
identified an interesting

dependency of particle size in relation to the influence of the
convective term. With increasing particle size, the influence of
the convective term decreases, as the maximum velocity is also
reduced. This finding can therefore justify why the convective
term in the temperature equation can by neglected in the case of
very large wood particles.

PAnother common simplification is to neglect the influence of the
heat capacity of the gas phase [34,42,43,47,50,51,60]. This is a fair
assumption, since the thermal mass (defined as micP, i, with m being
the mass of a species) of wood char is 650 times larger than the ther-
mal mass of gases [47]. In Eq. (2), two different phase averages, the
intrinsic average and the phase average, are used, which are
explained hereafter.

PThe intrinsic phase average is the averaged value within a single
phase. This means that the intrinsic average of the variable ’ within
the phase i, is defined as [22]

diffusion in a porous medium, such as wood. It is suggested by
Fogler [72] that it can be related to the binary diffusion coefficient, D,

neglected, since it is assumed that it is much smaller compared to
convection [50,51,60]. The convective term of the volatile species
equation was adjusted by Galgano et al. [60], such that the influence
of the formation of cracks was partly considered in their work. They
assumed that only a fraction of the entire gas phase is actually trans-
ported out by convection, and therefore has to pass the entire thick-
ness of the hot char layer [60]. This means that a fraction of gases is
modeled to leave the wood particle immediately along cracks and
fissures.

Pwhere the effective permeability again is a combination of intrinsic,
Kg and relative permeability, Krg. Generally speaking, the intrinsic
permeability is higher for softwoods than for hardwoods, and higher
for sapwood than for heartwood [22]. Eq. (17) is also known as
Darcy’s law. Using Darcy’s law to model gas phase advection is a
common approach [1,22,36(cid:1)43,45,55,61,62]. Since one expects a
laminar flow in the pores, and since the viscous forces dominate
over the inertial forces in the woody biomass structure, the compu-
tation of liquid and gas phase advection inside the wood with
Darcy’s law is reasonable [73].

PIt has been experimentally shown that significant pressure peaks
can form inside a wood log [74]. It was also found that the pressure
has an influence on the distribution of the devolatilization products
within the solid, since the mass transfer is linked to the effect of
pressure gradients on mass transfer velocity and thus also on resi-
dence times of products in the interior of the particle [75].

PThere are works in which the gas flow was not based on Darcy’s
law. Sand et al. [56] modeled gas phase behavior inside and outside
of the wood log by fully solving the momentum equation, and were
thereby able to identify a gas plume leaving the wood log. The influ-
ence of such a plume on the entire wood log degradation processes
has not been investigated intensively so far, and accordingly, the
importance of such a detailed description of the gas flow inside and
outside the wood log needs to be investigated in more detail in the
future.

PThe direction of the gas flow is often restricted, as it is com-
mon to assume that gases can only move away from the wet
core [34,46,49,52,60]. Such a simplifying assumption neglects
entirely the fact that gaseous products of thermal conversion can
also move inwards, towards cooler regions and condense there.
This would then require the modeling of tar and water vapor re-
condensation, which is not commonly done. Only a few works
model
the inwards and outwards movement of produced
gases [36,39,45,54], even though in those works, condensation
reactions are still neglected. Wurzenberger et al. [45] experimen-
tally found condensation reactions of gases moving inwards. It is
therefore suggested that condensation reactions are relevant. It
would also be interesting to see how an asymmetric flow field,
due to the anisotropy of wood, affects the importance of tar con-
densation reactions during thermal conversion modeling. Addi-
tionally, it is not yet known how anisotropic heating affects the
importance of tar re-condensation modeling.

PIn order to solve the previously discussed governing equations,
suitable boundary conditions have to be chosen and the most com-
mon ones are discussed hereafter.

P4.1.1. Boundary conditions

PFor temperature evolution in a wood particle, it is most common
to consider the influence of radiation and convection at the bound-
aries [5,8,10,22,34,35,38,40,42,49,52(cid:1)54]. Some works set a fixed
uniform radiant heat flux to heat up the wood log, and assigned
losses to the boundaries, which result from convection and re-
radiation [22,37,50,54,60,62].
It is also a common approach to
assign fixed background temperatures, either one single tempera-
ture [36,39,42,43,47,52,53] or a combination of radiation tempera-
ture (commonly furnace temperature), Trad, and convective
temperature (from the surrounding gas phase), Tconv, [7,10], which
results in heating of the wood particle.

PThe value of the applied heat flux has a significant effect on the
produced char, since at higher heat fluxes the char density will
decrease at the boundaries, while it will be higher in the interior of
the wood log, due to slower heating inside. Faster heating at the
boundaries, as a result of applying high heat fluxes, yields enhanced
tar production and reduced char production [40]. Seljeskog and
Skreiberg [63] set their boundary conditions such that two different
heat fluxes could be applied at the bottom and top surface of the

Pwood log. Accordingly, this model grants the flexibility to its user to
also model asymmetric heating conditions that are more realistic in
stoves.

PNone of the works has considered that the steam, exiting from
the interior of the particle primarily during drying, can build a layer
around the particles outer surface and absorb some of the radiation
that heats up the particle [52]. Consequently, it is of interest for
future work to identify how large the influence of such a layer on
the temperature history of the particle really is.

PThe radiative heat flux from the flame was only mentioned in
a limited number of works [64]. Even though this was a first step
towards considering the back-radiation of the flame to the wood
it has to be pointed out that the validity is
particle surface,
restricted, as a constant uniform heat flux was applied [64].
However, in the case of a real flame, the radiant heat flux will
fluctuate significantly, mainly due to the highly transient thermal
conversion process.

emissivity has been assigned a

PThe particle emissivity is an important parameter that couples
the exterior conditions of the solid with the drying, devolatiliza-
tion and char burnout processes occurring inside the particle.
Particle
of 0.85
[7,10,40,52,53,55] but also higher values of 0.9 [1,38,42,43] and
0.95 [48] and 1 [37,39] have been applied. A comparably low par-
ticle emissivity of 0.78 [54] has rarely been used. Surprisingly,
some works even assume the emissivity of wood to exceed the
emissivity of char [56]. In addition, some works did not account
for significant changes of emissivity as wood converted to
char [62,64] which is considered a weakness of a model, as one
expects the emissivities to vary, because there is a significant
change in elemental composition as wood degrades to char.

value

PThe applied emissivities do not follow a certain trend (a depen-
dency on the composition of the initial wood species) or a depen-
dency on the degree of conversion. It seems that the value of the
emissivity is fitted in order to obtain better agreement between
numerical and experimental results. It is also assumed that the
ambiguous choice of emissivity values is due to the overall limited
range of values for different wood species available in literature.

PFor external heat and mass transfer, heat and mass transfer coef-
ficients have to be defined. Some authors therefore assume constant
values [34,37,40,54,59], while others have started to work on a more
detailed description of heat and mass transfer to the particle surface.
A primary influence on these two coefficients is due to outflowing
gases, which will reduce the transfer coefficients. This indicates that
the gases leaving the particle act as a convective barrier [52,53]. One
of the effects of the outflowing gases is also that they tend to react
with oxygen before it can reach the active char sites. Porteiro
et al. [52,53] considered such a reaction only for the exiting hydro-
gen. They corrected heat and mass transfer coefficients due to the
blowing by the model suggested by Moffat and Kays [76]. In this cor-
relation, a geometrical parameter and a blowing factor are related to
the Stanton number with blowing, and a Stanton number without
blowing. From the adjusted Stanton number the heat transfer coeffi-
cient can be calculated. De Souza Costa and Sandberg [49] also con-
sidered the blowing effect of exiting gases by the following
expression of the heat transfer coefficient

hs 1⁄4 h0

lnð1 þ BsÞ
Bs

ð18Þ

where Bs is the smoldering transfer number, which is a function of
mass fractions of oxygen [49]. Transpiration effects influencing
heat and mass transfer coefficients are accounted for in some
works [50,51].

PBruch et al. [46] took this outflow of gases into consideration by
using the Stefan correlation. The Stefan correlation corrects the
transfer coefficients for mass and heat, which are not influenced by
blowing of gases, by the influence of the mass flow of gases exiting

where _mg is the mass flux of gases, hc0 is the not-influenced heat
transfer coefficient and hm0 is the not-influenced mass transfer coef-
ficient. The corrected mass and heat transfer coefficients are hc and
hm, respectively [77].

PThe influence of blowing factors on the temperature profile of a
particle significantly depends on whether radiation or convection
dominate the heat transfer to the particle. It is acceptable to neglect
the influence of the blowing factor with respect to heat transfer phe-
nomena if radiation dominates the heat transfer to the particle [78].
However, if convection dominates, the blowing factor has to be con-
sidered, as it can slow down the particle devolatilization process by
about 20% [78]. The conclusion is that depending on the choice of
boundary conditions, the blowing effect on heat and mass transfer
has to be considered (convection dominates) or can be neglected
(radiation dominates).

PThe pressure at the boundary is handled in such a manner, that it

is commonly set equal to the atmospheric pressure, e.g. [37,40,43].

PThe layer model, applied by a number of

researchers
[7,10,44,52,53], used homogeneous boundary conditions for its
implementation. The original work by Thunman et al. [44] was based
on an Eulerian discretization, which does not require homogeneous
boundary conditions as such. In fact, the boundary conditions can
vary and instead of relating conversion to the external surface of the
particle it was related to the surface area per unit volume. A signifi-
cant spatial variation in boundary conditions can only be accurately
modeled if the discretization is finer than the size of the particle.

PHowever, in order to include highly diverse boundary conditions,
it is recommended to develop a multi-dimensional mesh-based
model in order to yield sufficient accuracy.

PAfter having discussed how the particle is linked to its exterior, it
is now of further interest to discuss how the thermal conversion pro-
cesses in the interior of the particle are modeled.

4.2. Drying

PThis section describes the theory of drying of thermally thick
woody biomass. Water is present as bound water, liquid free water
and water vapor in the porous structure of wood. Bound water is
attached to cell walls as OH-groups bound to structures of cellulose
and hemicellulose (and not that many attachments to lignin). The
presence of bound water is considered to be significant due to the
hygroscopic nature of wood materials. Free water is liquid water in
voids in the biomass, which is held in place due to capillary forces.
Water vapor is considered as a species in the gas phase resulting
from evaporation [18].

PDrying is an endothermic process [23] that is prolonging the
heat-up time [5]. There will not be any mass loss of the organic
solid fuel until devolatilization starts. Water evaporates and
leaves the wood as vapor, and if the heating rates are sufficiently
high, the cell walls might be affected by higher pressures due to
vapor formation in the pores. In special cases, extractives, such
as resins, can melt and block the pores. The result is that the
convective transport of the gas phase through the pores is
slowed down or entirely hindered, which explains such a pres-
sure increase in the porous body as previously mentioned. Physi-
cal changes in the wood related to drying can also be explained
with respect to different dilatation rates along and across the

Pwood fibers. Due to this variation of dilatation in different spatial
directions, the resulting tension increase can lead to cracking of
wood structures. These cracks can eventually help to accelerate
the drying process, since the surface of the wood log exposed to
the heat source is increased [23] and also permeability increases.
PDuring evaporation, water vapor can move towards higher
temperature regions, but
it can also move towards cooler
regions and condense there [79]. The simplifying assumption of
negligible re-condensation of water vapor
is a common
approach when drying is modeled. Only a very limited number
of works considered re-condensation of water vapor [42,47,78].
It is said that the effect of re-condensation on the overall
modeling results of thermal conversion is negligible. However,
since hardly any works include re-condensation, it is not fully
known how such a re-condensation of water vapor affects the
overall heating-up of the wood log and the conversion time, in
comparison to the modeling of an ideal irreversible evaporation
of water vapor. This should be studied for anisotropic heating of
large wood particles.

POne highly interesting aspect has been discussed by Lu et al. [78],
who split water into bound water and liquid free water when model-
ing the drying of a poplar wood particle. Lu et al. [78] found that
bound water and liquid free water do not vaporize in the same man-
ner, which outlines that the present liquid water has to be split
accordingly. They assumed that bound water can only be irreversibly
reduced in heterogeneous Arrhenius expressions reflecting the
evaporation of water, while liquid free water evaporation can be
reversible and re-condensation reactions can also increase the
amount of present liquid free water.

POne expects the pressure distribution within the wood log to
vary if water vapor re-condenses, so it therefore seems reason-
able to assume that the convective transport of gaseous species
out of the porous medium, and accordingly the entire heat and
mass transfer within a wood log, are likewise affected. However,
the identification of the degree of this influence is recommended
to be an objective of future work. In the case of biomass with a
lower moisture content, the influence of re-condensation reac-
tions is also less compared to woody particles with a signifi-
cantly higher moisture content.

PShrinkage is also occurring during drying, though in modeling it
is mostly neglected [10] since it occurs to a significantly smaller
extent compared to the volumetric shrinkage occurring during devo-
latilization, or even the particle size reduction due to heterogeneous
reactions taking place during char conversion.

PThe reason for shrinkage during drying is that the cell walls lose
the bound water that has been attached to hydroxyl-groups of cellu-
lose and hemicellulose via hydrogen bonds. In comparison, the free
water does not have any influence on shrinkage, as it only affects the
density of the wood particle [10]. This relation indicates that wood
does not show any change in size if moisture above the fiber satura-
tion point is evaporated, while it is affected by shrinkage if moisture
is lost below the fiber saturation point [33]. Shrinkage during drying
accounts for 5(cid:1)10% of size reduction of the entire particle [43].
Shrinkage related to the stage of drying is reversible, since the parti-
cle can swell again if exposed to humidity [10].

PWhat is most interesting is that due to various shrinkage rates in
longitudinal, radial and tangential direction, the wood particle can
be distorted. This is also valid for shrinkage during devolatilization,
and any comparable physical change of the wood particle results in
an influence on heat and mass transfer, and accordingly the overall
thermal conversion. It is a natural consequence that such a diversity
of shrinkage, which varies significantly with direction, can only be
accurately replicated in a multi-dimensional model, while 1D mod-
els focus on shrinkage in only one preferential direction.

PShrinkage during drying, often defined as the percentage of the
green dimension, depends on the wood species [33]. The green

where hvap represents the vaporization enthalpy of water. The rate of

rate or an equilibrium drying model [10]. Attention has to be paid
when modeling the heat of evaporation. Only in a limited number of
works [22,38,40] have the influences of bound water and liquid free
water been explicitly modeled. Depending on whether the available
moisture content exceeds the fiber saturation point or not, the heat
of evaporation has to be calculated differently. If the moisture con-
tent exceeds the fiber saturation point, the heat of vaporization
Dhevap is calculated such that [22]

where Dhl is the latent heat of vaporization of water, which is inde-

the fiber saturation point, the heat of vaporization is calculated as a
combination of the latent heat of vaporization of water and the dif-
ferential heat of sorption, Dhsorp, such that [22]

The differential heat of sorption mainly depends on the structure of
the wood, and is hence important in a regime lacking liquid free
water but with bound water present [38].

which highlights that the level of enthalpy of the bound water
depends on the bound water itself [22]. The consideration of bound
water in current models is very limited, and the water is not com-
monly split into liquid free water and bound water. This is consid-
ered a weakness since the transport of bound water and liquid free
water have to be modeled differently. It is also not uncommon to
neglect both the diffusion and convective transport of water all
together [5,7,8,10,52,53].

ð25Þ

PBased on the available literature, it seems that the scientific
world is in favor of the thermal drying model [5,7,8,10,46,50(cid:1)53,
56,60,63]. This method is based on the assumption that drying
occurs at a fixed boiling temperature at atmospheric pressure,
373.15 K, and that any amount of heat above this temperature will
be consumed by the drying process in order to vaporize the mois-
ture [10]. The advantage of thermal drying models is that they are
easy to implement in numerical codes. However, the robustness of
the thermal model is limited because it results in a step-function,
which can result in numerical instabilities. The operational condi-
tions, under which the thermal model can be applied, require that a
high-temperature environment is given, and also that the size of the
drying front is comparably small in contrast to the entire particle
dimension [10]. Furthermore, it was found that the assumption of
evaporation at exactly 373 K is wrong, since due to significant water
vapor formation the pressure in the wood log interior increases,
such that the actual pressure significantly differs from atmospheric
pressure [77]. This suggests that higher boiling point temperatures
are given and it is recommended to model the actual evaporation
temperature as a function of wood internal pressure.

PThe equilibrium model employs the assumption of a thermody-
namic equilibrium between the liquid water and the water vapor in
the gas phase. The difference between the equilibrium concentration
and the current vapor concentration in the gas phase is the driving
force for the drying process. The equilibrium method is usually
considered in low-temperature drying models [10]. This approach
has been employed by several researchers [22,55,61]. Alves and

Fig. 2. Shrinkage dependency on wood species. The figure illustrates the shrinkage for
a range of different hardwood and softwood species. Shrinkage occurs when green
wood is dried to an oven-dry basis. Trend lines have been added to indicate that the
shrinkage values increase as the density of certain wood species increases (= higher
shrinkage for wood species of a higher density). More detailed information on shrink-
age for different hardwood and softwood species can be found elsewhere [33]. The
figure was based on data provided in a reference work for the various properties of
wood [33]. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the
reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

Pdimension relates to the dimension of the green wood particle.
Moreover, the shrinkage is also affected by the moisture content [33]
such that

where S is shrinkage, %, from green wood to wood of a certain resid-

saturation point, Mfsp, is defined as the critical point where the cell
walls of the wood contain the maximum quantity of bound water
but no liquid free water is yet present. This relation is only valid if
M < Mfsp.

PWhen comparing shrinkage for different hardwood species and
softwood species, it was found that the shrinkage also depends on
the wood species. It appears to be the case that radial, tangential and
volumetric shrinkage tend to increase for wood species of higher
densities, even though it has to be pointed out as well that the
dependency is modest. Fig. 2 shows the dependency of shrinkage, %,
on different hardwood and softwood species.

PIn current models, shrinkage during drying is usually neglected.
One can therefore conclude that an enhanced modeling focus on
physical changes during drying can be a field of interest in future
research.

PFigueiredo [34] assumed that drying based on the equilibrium model
is only valid for a moisture content below 14.4%, while above this
value, the thermal model is applied.

PEven though it has been stated that the equilibrium model is gen-
erally applicable in low-temperature processes, it has also been
applied in these works in a high-temperature environment, such as
in combustion and gasification processes. It is considered that espe-
cially at lower heating rates, where the time to reach the boiling
point temperature is significantly long, the influence of an accurate
modeling of drying below the boiling point temperature is signifi-
cant; even so, it is presumed that for most combustion processes, a
high-temperature environment can be assumed, which justifies the
neglecting of drying below 100 °C.

PBased on these strengths and weaknesses of the present drying
models, it can be concluded that a combination of equilibrium and a
thermal model can result in a good prediction of drying over a broad
temperature range, because the implementation of such a combined
model results in a good description of both low-temperature and
high-temperature drying.

PAn alternative to the thermal drying model is the kinetic rate
model, which has the primary advantage that it is more numerically
stable, since it lacks the discontinuity. Furthermore, one can model
drying to occur over a broader temperature range (depends on how
kinetic data is adjusted), and therefore also consider drying below
the boiling point temperature to some extent by fitting the kinetic
data. In addition one can account for bound water, which evaporates
at higher temperatures than 373 K. In the kinetic rate models, the
drying is considered a heterogeneous reaction, and an Arrhenius
equation is used to calculate its rate [44]. The pre-exponential factor
and activation energy are set such that the evaporation mainly
occurs around the water boiling temperature [10]. In contrast to the
common application of thermal models, there is a smaller number of
papers that apply the kinetic rate model [42,44,47,54,62,64]. Three
different combinations of activation energy and pre-exponential
factor were found. Bryden et al. [42,47], Shen et al. [54] as well as
Ding et al. [64] used 5:13 (cid:3) 1010 s(cid:1)1 as a pre-exponential factor and
an activation energy of 88 kJ/mol. Pozzobon et al. [62] used the
same activation energy but applied a lower pre-exponential factor of
5:13 (cid:3) 106 s(cid:1)1. Thunman et al. [44] used an activation energy of
approximately 207 kJ/mol, while the pre-exponential factor was set
to 1027s(cid:1)1 by Thunman et al. [44]. With respect to the pre-exponen-
tial factors applied in these works, one can identify a clear discrep-
ancy between the chosen values, since Thunman et al. [44] modeled
a layer model, in which infinitely fast reactions, in this case phase
change, are expected, such that the zone where reactions occur is
very narrow (= infinitely thin) and high pre-exponential factors are
required. This model is based to a certain degree on assuming very
fast conversion stages, while Bryden et al. [42,47] developed a mesh-
based model, where reaction zones can also be thicker and accord-
ingly phase change due to drying does not have to be infinitely fast.

PFinally we will now discuss the numerical efficiency of the ther-
mal drying model and the kinetic rate model. The equilibrium model
is not included in the discussion, since it is only relevant for low-
temperature drying conditions, while the combustion environment
in wood stoves requires models that are suitable for high-tempera-
ture conditions. Due to the fact that it has frequently been pointed
out that the thermal drying model is lacking numerical robustness,
the authors aimed to investigate this drawback of the drying model
by comparing it to the more stable kinetic rate model.

PFor this comparison, a model, based on the one developed by Di
Blasi [37] is used. Kinetic data was taken from Font et al. [80] (K3 in
Di Blasi’s work [37]). Because Di Blasi only discussed a dry particle,
we just added the two drying models, after having successfully vali-
dated the dry particle modeling against Di Blasi [37]. The transport
equations for drying were taken from Melaaen [38]. The moisture
content was 5 wt%, wet basis. For both the thermal drying and

Pkinetic rate model, the tolerance of the iterative solver defining the

convergence criteria of the model was set to 10
tion was done with a backward differentiation formula (BDF). It was
found that using the kinetic rate model with kinetic data by Chan
et al. [81] (pre-exponential factor being 5.13 £ 106 s(cid:1)1 and the activa-
tion energy being 88 kJ/mol), resulted in the applicability of a signifi-
cantly larger temporal resolution compared to the thermal drying
model. The chosen time step using the kinetic rate model was as
(cid:1)4 s, whereas the thermal drying model required
large as 2:5 (cid:3) 10
(cid:1)6 s. Most interesting was also that by
time steps as small as 1 (cid:3) 10
increasing the external heat flux, the numerical stability of the ther-
mal drying model was significantly affected. The temporal resolution
(cid:1)7 s when increasing the
had to be refined from 1 (cid:3) 10
external heat flux from 70 kW/m2 to 100 kW/m2.

(cid:1)6 s to 5 (cid:3) 10

PWhen increasing the stiffness of the kinetic drying model, by
using a higher pre-exponential factor (5:13 (cid:3) 1010s(cid:1)1) as suggested
by Bryden et al. [42], the temporal resolution had to be refined. In
(cid:1)6 s. Such
this case, the time step size had to be reduced to 7:5 (cid:3) 10
an increase in stiffness mimics the reduction of the size of the drying
zone, because it concentrates evaporation reactions in a more nar-
row temperature region. Accordingly, by increasing the pre-expo-
nential factor, the kinetic rate model approaches the principle of
very thin drying zones, as commonly implemented in layer models.

PIt was found that the choice of drying model has a significant
influence on the numerical efficiency of the overall thermal conver-
sion model of a thermally thick wood particle. This is the case, since
the time step size is determined by drying and not by devolatiliztion
reactions. It was also found that the low robustness of the thermal
drying model is a key weakness of this model, and that the kinetic
rate model is less complex to implement in a code.

PBesides these numerical aspects all three models are capable of
demonstrating that the overall heating time of wet wood is greatly
affected by the amount of moisture in the wood log.

4.3. Devolatilization

PDevolatilization is a thermochemical degradation process that
occurs by definition in the absence of oxygen. While tar and perma-
nent gases are formed and leave the wood log via the pores, oxygen
can only enter the wood log via diffusion, since these gas compounds
build up a convective barrier to inflow.

PIn some works, there is a clear differentiation between pyrolysis
and devolatilization, as pyrolysis is assumed to occur in a reducing
environment, while devolatilization is related to thermochemical
degradation in oxidizing environment. However, most particles that
are thermochemically degrading are within a volatile cloud that to
some extent mimics a reducing atmosphere, so these two expres-
sions can be used interchangeably [78].

PChemical reactions, as well as physical processes that occur dur-
ing thermal conversion, have to be modeled simultaneously since
they influence one another [82]. The fresh green wood (=moist
wood) is primarily heated by conduction. After drying, the heated
part subsequently undergoes thermochemical degradation and the
release of volatiles starts. In thermally thick particles, drying and
devolatilization can overlap, even though they never overlap in
space. The permanent gases that are formed during devolatilization
include a vast variety of chemical species, with the main compounds
being CO, CO2, CH4 and H2. Produced in lower quantities are also
light hydrocarbons such as ethene, propene and nitrogenous com-
pounds [18]. In addition tar is formed, which is organic compounds
that are liquid at ambient temperature [18]. This broad range of dif-
ferent gas phase compounds makes it clear that modeling all the
species related to devolatilization reactions is a challenge, and the
so-called lumping procedure has therefore been introduced. As
part of this method, various products of thermochemical biomass

Pdegradation are collected in different product categories, namely
char, tar and permanent gases [83].

PAfter all the gases have been removed, only a char layer
remains [82]. Mostly due to higher pressure inside the particle
(and due to a higher char permeability), the flow of the gases is
directed towards the heated surface.
In the high-temperature
region, which the gases have to pass, secondary tar reactions,
cracking or re-polymerization, occur. These reactions may occur
homogeneously in the gas phase, or might also be heterogeneous
and occur on the char surface. The gases can also be directed
towards the virgin wood, which has a lower temperatures, lead-
ing to condensation. However, only a small fraction of the entire
gases will be directed towards the colder wood region. As a
result, the convective inward transport of heat and mass is often
neglected in models. The condensed gas phase compounds can
evaporate again if the temperature at the spatial location in the
wood log increases over a critical value due to ongoing heat
transfer phenomena [82].

PThe char layer forming on the biomass tends to build up on the
non-devolatilized wood as devolatilization continues. This leads to
an increased residence time of tar, thereby enhancing cracking or re-
polymerization. As thermal degradation continues, the physical
parameters of wood logs change due to shrinkage and cracking of
the solid fuel, which again have to be considered in cases of heat,
mass and momentum transfer [82]. During devolatilization, mass
loss of wood will be around 80% due to the formation of gaseous
products [23].

PFurthermore, shrinkage becomes more important during devola-
tilization compared to its relevance during drying. This process is
not reversible, and its degree depends on wood species, peak tem-
perature and temperature history. It is also interesting that lignin
can swell during devolatilization, which adds even more complexity
to numerical modeling [43]. Shrinkage is influenced by the aniso-
tropic properties of wood. The theoretical discussion of devolatiliza-
tion underscores that considering detailed chemistry and detailed
changes in wood structure yields a high-complexity model. Conse-
quently, it is of interest to review all the chemical and physical
aspects of devolatilization and identify the most relevant ones and
some additional simplifications, such that future models can easily
find the balance between accuracy and complexity, and therefore
save computational time.

P4.3.1. Mathematical modeling of wood devolatilization

(cid:1)(cid:2)gk5rtar

PThe modeling of devolatilization of wood requires the description
of chemical and physical phenomena in a mathematical form. There-
fore, the most relevant governing equations for devolatilization
modeling are discussed in this chapter. When modeling gas phase
continuity Eq. (14) the devolatilization source term _vdev occurs,
which is defined as [37]
_vdev
1⁄4 ðk1 þ k2Þrwood
where ki with i = 1,2,5 are reaction rate constants modeled with
Arrhenius expressions. This is only an exemplary reaction pathway
where three independent competitive reactions describe wood deg-
radation. However, in a more generic way one can state that the first
term in Eq. (26) represents primary devolatilization reactions and
the second term describes secondary devolatilization reactions.
Reaction rate constants k1 and k2 are due to permanent gases and tar
formed from wood, respectively, whereas k5 refers to the reaction
where tar is converted to char again. The mass change of solid wood
is defined as [1]

similarly as

PThe permanent gas phase includes a broad range of different spe-
cies and the range of compounds that form this product group [19]
is discussed hereafter. A detailed discussion on gas phase products
from devolatilization is found in Neves et al. [19].

PCommonly, one lumps together CO, CO2, H2 and CH4, as well
as other light hydrocarbons, when modeling permanent gases.
Additional light hydrocarbons are C2 species, as well as C3 spe-
cies. It was found that the main compounds of the permanent
gas phase species are CO and CO2, and light hydrocarbons and
H2 are also commonly present in lower amounts. This composi-
tion is little influenced by heating rate. In fact, CO, CH4 and H2
show similar temperature dependencies as far as their formation
trends are concerned. It is also found that the higher light hydro-
carbons (mostly C2 species) increases linearly with methane,
thereby suggesting that they have similar reaction pathways.
However, the formation of CO2 with respect to temperature
changes deviates from what is observed in the case of the other
compounds [19]. If the temperature is approximately 500 °C, it
is expected that the major contribution of volatile species is
derived from primary devolatilization reactions. In such cases,
CO and CO2 are the main compounds while small amounts of
CH4 are also present. At approximately 450 °C, 2/3 of the entire
mass of dry gas species are CO2, while the residual fraction is
primarily CO. It has also been found that at temperatures below
500 °C the composition of the volatile species does not show a
strong temperature dependency. However, as
temperatures
increase and exceed 500 °C, the yields of combustible gases in
the volatile species become strongly temperature-dependent.
Such a change in composition above 500 °C is mainly related to
secondary reactions. As the temperature increases from about
500 °C to 850 °C, the mass fraction of CO increases from 2 to
15% to 30(cid:1)55% (based on dry and ash-free fuel) [19]. Accord-
ingly, the tar yield decreases. Some tars are also converted to
light hydrocarbons (including CH4), which thereby increases
from 1% at around 500 °C to 10% at temperatures higher than
850 °C. Hydrogen shows a similar temperature dependency, and
increases from < 0.2% at around 500 °C to > 1% at above 850 °
C. It is therefore suggested that if a significant increase in CO
and H2 can be found in experiments, the presence of secondary
tar reactions is highly relevant for an accurate prediction of per-
manent gas phase species product distribution. As mentioned
earlier, the temperature dependency of CO2 deviates from the
temperature dependency of the residual species forming the vol-
In the case of CO2, no significant change with

respect to an increasing temperature is found. This highlights
that CO2 is a main product of primary reactions [19].

PThe change of char mass due to devolatilization reactions is mod-
eled as being influenced by primary and secondary devolatilization
reactions, but also gasification reactions _vgasif and oxidation reac-
tions _voxid influence the char yield

PThe overall mass change of char, Eq. (30), is modeled similarly to

PModeling the degradation of wood occurring during devolatiliza-
tion is a vast field of research. Di Blasi [84] stated in her work that
the field of chemical kinetics of biomass is highly debated. The com-
plexity is that wood is a mixture of many different compounds that
degrade differently. Not only does the raw material differ, but also a
high number of different products needs to be modeled, which even
further challenges researchers. Mathematically, this indicates a high
number of required equations. The kinetics of these models can vary
a lot in their stiffness, so the computational efficiency is also
affected [85]. However, the computational cost and accuracy need to
be balanced, and researchers inevitably have to apply simplified
models to overcome this challenge [86]. The most common models
are discussed in the following sections.

PFinally the influence of devolatilization reactions on the tempera-
ture of the wood log has to be modeled. Due to devolatilization, the
source term in the energy equation Eq. (2) is given by

where Dhk is the heat of reaction, due to devolatilization reactions,
with the first term representing primary devolatilization and the
second term secondary reactions. As will be outlined later, it is a
challenge to define accurate values for the heat of reaction for devo-
latilization, since it tends to vary from endothermic to exothermic
reactions as conversion proceeds. We will go more into detail on
how heat and mass source terms related to devolatilization reactions
are modeled in those governing equations, and which challenges
arise with certain model approaches.

P4.3.2. One-step global mechanism model

PThe reaction mechanism of a one-step global mechanism can be

illustrated as [20]

ð33Þ
This is the most simplified reaction scheme applied in a number of
works as shown by the number of different kinetic data used in the
models (see Fig. 3). The temperature dependency of the Arrhenius
expression defining kinetic rate constants is plotted in Fig. 3.

PThe kinetic rate constant by Ding et al. [64] seems to be inconsis-
tent with the rest of the data used to model the one-step global reac-
tion mechanism. It shows a steep increase of the reaction rate with
respect to temperature increase, and eventually highly exceeds all
the other values for reaction rate constants already at 500 K. It is
therefore suggested that this set of data predicts too fast devolatili-
zation. The inconsistency of kinetic data in the case of Ding et al. [64]
is also highlighted by the fact that for the devolatilization modeling
of birch wood, Larfeldt et al. [41] used a much lower kinetic rate
constant, which agrees with what has been used for other hard-
woods [46,55,57]. There is also a slight discrepancy in kinetic data
used for beech devolatilization modeling by Yuen et al. [55] and
Bruch et al. [46]. However, none of those two reaction rates increase
unreasonably fast, and therefore both models are assumed to yield
reasonable conversion rates.

PThe primary disadvantage of the one-step global model is that
the produced gas phase is not automatically split into tar and perma-
nent gases [22]. In order to clearly split the gaseous fraction, a
stoichiometric coefficient for tar has to be known prior to model-
ing [22]. It is expected that the mass fractions of these two products
are inversely linked, and that the ratio between the two products
depends on operational conditions. In this approach, the reactant
(wood) is considered to be homogeneous [37]. Considering only one

the reaction rate constant, k [1/s] is plotted against the temperature, [K]. Kinetic data,
used in a number of independent models in which different wood species were mod-
eled, are plotted.

Preactant, and consequently only defining kinetics with respect to a
single reaction rate constant is often considered to be a rather crude
approximation, even though the justification of this model is that
the thermal behavior of biomass reflects the behavior of the sum of
its compounds and tt is not the response of every single com-
pound [37].

PMany researchers work with single first-order reactions (one-
component mechanism) when modeling devolatilization [41,50,51,
55,57,60,64]. Some works [50,51] fitted the modeled mass losses
and therefore the kinetics to experiments, such that surface reac-
tions could be used to model devolatilization. This was done, since
the model was based on an interface-based approach, and it was
assumed that devolatilization only occurs at the surface of the dry
wood layer. Such a fitting can be considered a weakness.

PEven so, the primary advantage of the one-step global mecha-
nism is that product yields, as well as overall decomposition rates,
can be predicted accurately enough at a reasonable computational
cost [10]. It is suggested that this is acceptable for most engineering
applications. However, one might think that for larger particles this
does not apply, since there is a large temperature difference in the
particle and in one-step global reaction mechanisms, such a temper-
ature influence on the char yield cannot be modeled pre-
cisely [20,87]. Furthermore, it is concluded that for the purpose of
fundamental research on devolatilization, a more detailed devolatili-
zation reaction model is recommended.

P4.3.3. Independent competitive reactions model

PIn the three independent competitive reactions model, the solid
input material degrades competitively to char, tar and permanent
gases. The principle scheme of the independent competitive reaction
model is presented in Fig. 4. The only linkage between the product

Pyields is through the mass fraction (the sum of all mass fractions at a
certain time equal unity) [88].

PA broad range of kinetic data for the three independent competi-
tive reactions model is currently available and used in wood particle
degradation modeling. Some of the most commonly applied kinetic
data is discussed hereafter.

PThurner and Mann [89] present kinetics that are commonly used
and that are derived from experiments with oak. The main disadvan-
tage of this set of kinetic data is that the experiments were only con-
ducted in a temperature range from 300(cid:1)400 °C, which is very
narrow and low. It is known that e.g. devolatilization reactions for
cellulose can start below 300 °C, and overall devolatilization is
expected to be finished at approximately 500 °C. The experiments
were conducted with oak sawdust, which suggests that the kinetic
data is mainly applicable to hardwood species. The influence of sec-
ondary reactions was aimed to be avoided during these experiments
by keeping the temperature low. This suggests that if the kinetic
data by Thurner and Mann [89] is to be used for modeling thermally
thick particles, the modeling approach always has to be coupled
with secondary reactions in order to predict the thermal conversion
of a thermally thick particle with an acceptable accuracy. In general,
it is more accurate to include secondary reactions as particle size
increases.

PA second set of commonly applied kinetic data was presented by
Font et al. [80], who conducted experiments in a temperature range
from 400 to 605 °C. This therefore leads to the conclusion that the
kinetic data may not be valid in the temperature range from 200
to 400 °C, in which the degradation of holocellulose (combined
cellulose and hemicellulose) in particular will occur. Furthermore,
almond shells were tested, and no specific wood species can thus be
directly related to this set of kinetic data.

PThe third very common set of kinetics was presented by Chan
et al. [81], who based their kinetic model on two references. The
kinetics for char formation were estimated from a previous work by
Shafizadeh (obtained via personal communication, see [81]). The
modeling results are highly sensitive to the kinetic data of char for-
mation. Permanent gas and tar formation reactions and correspond-
ing kinetic data were taken from Hajaligol et al. [90]. In this work,
the rapid pyrolysis of cellulose was tested (1000 °C/s), and the tem-
perature range of the experiments was between 300 and 1100 °C.

PThese three sets of kinetics are very often used when modeling
thermochemical degradation of a single particle with the three
independent competitive reactions scheme. The three independent
competitive reactions model is commonly coupled to secondary tar
reactions. If secondary tar reactions are neglected, this is linked
to the simplifying assumption of produced gases exiting the wood
particle or log immediately as they are formed. Such a simplifying
assumption has been the basis for a number of works [44,52,53,59].
Bruch et al. [46] claimed that in the particle size range they were
modeling (5 to 25 mm), only less than 10 % of the primary tars are
cracked or re-polymerized, and accordingly, secondary reactions can
be neglected.

POne can also assume that without a correct inclusion of second-
ary charring or tar cracking reactions, the pressure field in the inte-
rior of the wood log is not predicted accurately, hence influencing
the calculation of the gas phase velocity. However, this influence on
the pressure prediction is assumed to be less important, since the
overall prediction of the pressure is related to a number of uncer-
tainties. These uncertainties include the common neglect of the
formation of cracks in the char, in addition to a high uncertainty
concerning commonly used permeability values.

PTar condensation reactions can also occur in a second stage after
primary devolatilization, but such condensation reactions are com-
monly neglected (all works listed in Table 3 have neglected tar con-
densation). It is said that their influence on the thermal conversion
process is somewhat limited, and in 1D simulations, where this was

Pinvestigated in detail, it was found that the influence of tar conden-
sation on overall conversion is negligible [91]. However,
it is
assumed that if asymmetric heating at the boundary of the wood log
is given, the gaseous tar can flow to cooler regions and condense
there. One can then expect that this will lead to a blocking of the
pores, and a subsequent hindering of the convective transport of
gaseous species, which can affect the pressure field in the wood inte-
rior. However, since the majority of the gases is transported out-
wards, this tar condensations can be neglected without significantly
affecting modeling accuracy. The dependencies of devolatilization
models on the temperature are shown in Fig. 5 a(cid:1)c.

PThe mass loss rate of the center cell volume of the wood log ver-
sus the temperature in the center cell volume for different sets of
kinetic data is shown in Fig. 6.

PFig. 6 shows that wood mass starts degrading fastest with the
kinetic data suggested by Biswas and Umeki [1], while the kinetic
data of Chan et al. [81], Thurner and Mann [89] and Font et al. [80]
follow, respectively exhibiting lower mass loss rates. The modeled
wood mass loss rate by Biswas and Umeki [1] increases steeply until
it reaches a certain peak (a peak much higher compared to the other
models). The mass loss behavior is comparable to what has been
found for the other three sets of kinetic data, but occurs at a lower
temperature range. The conversion is over at about 580 °C, when
applying kinetic data by Biswas and Umeki [1]. This is a fast devolati-
lization compared to the other kinetic models resulting in devolatili-
zation being finished at approximately 600 to 620 °C. It is also
the models by Chan et al. [81], Thurner and
interesting that
Mann [89] and Font et al. [80] show a maximum mass loss rate at
approximately 480 °C, which is close to what is commonly assumed
to be the temperature where most of the devolatilization reactions
should be finished (500 °C). With the kinetic data used by Biswas
and Umeki, the peak in the mass loss rate occurred at slightly lower
temperatures, around 460(cid:1)470 °C. With respect to the data used by
Biswas and Umeki, it has to be added that they used data originally
derived by Di Blasi and Branca [92], who tested thermally thin par-
ticles and comparably high heating rates. It can also be seen from
Fig. 7 that Biswas and Umeki predicted the lowest residual solid
mass, which is consistent with the test conditions for the originally
derived data. With respect to the kinetics found by Font et al. [80],
where almond shells were tested, it has to be added that this data is
assumed relevant for wood degradation modeling, since it is similar
to the kinetic data obtained by Nunn et al. [93] for hardwood.

PFig. 7 shows that the kinetic data suggested by Font et al. [80]
yields the highest residual solid. It is interesting to see that the
amount of residual solid decreases as mass loss rates shown in Fig. 6
speed up, and also have their peak at lower temperatures. Thus, one
explanation is that the mass loss rates with a peak at a lower tem-
perature suggest that most of the mass losses are related to the deg-
radation of cellulose and hemicellulose. In the case of Font et al. [80],
the mass loss peaks at a slightly higher temperature, which agrees
more with the devolatilization temperature of lignin.

PA disadvantage of the three independent competitive reactions
model is that wood as a reactant is not described in detail. Therefore,
the validity of this reaction model is limited, since only wood species
similar to the experimentally tested wood species for obtaining the
kinetic data can be used. The main advantage of the this reaction
scheme is, that one can predict char, tar and permanent gas yields,
without pre-defining a stoichiometric coefficient that is required to
split the product yields.

POverall, it can be concluded that the three independent competi-
tive reaction scheme is a well-established concept that yields good
results compared to experimental work, even though it misses a
very detailed prediction of the product species.

PCommonly, the secondary tar cracking reactions, which are often
coupled with the three independent competitive reaction model, are
of first order [94]. There are also models where the primary tar does

Pnot directly form char due to re-polymerization reactions and per-
manent gas phase compounds due to cracking, but instead yields
secondary tar and permanent gases [22]. Various researchers have
recently extended their kinetic models of thermal wood degradation
to include secondary tar cracking [1,5,22,37,40,42,43,56,58,61].

PThe kinetic data used in their work is plotted against the temper-

ature in Fig. 8a and b.

PFig. 8a shows the range of variation between the maximum reac-
tion rate constant applied by Di Blasi [37] are the minimum reaction
rate constant used by Kwiatkowski [61].

PFig. 8b shows that the reaction rate constant used by Kwiatkow-
ski [61] is much slower than the reaction rate constant applied by
other researchers [1,37,42,43,47,56,57,62]. Comparing Fig. 8a and b
shows that heterogeneous reactions of tar to char are slower

Pcompared to homogeneous gas phase reactions of tar to permanent
gas phase compounds.

PFurthermore, different values for the heat of reaction of pyrolysis
were used. A common value for all primary reactions is -418 kJ/kg,
and the heat of pyrolysis of the two competing secondary reactions
is commonly set to 42 kJ/kg, e.g. [37,56]. Slight deviation from these
values is common [42,43,47]. Accordingly, it is a common assump-
tion to define primary devolatilization as endothermic reaction and
secondary devolatilization as exothermic reaction. Grønli and Mel-
aaen [40] chose different values (primary reactions endothermic
with (cid:1)150 kJ/kg and secondary reactions exothermic with 50 kJ/kg).
By comparing all these previously mentioned values, it is suggested
that there is no common consensus on heat of reactions. This lack of
common consensus can even be illustrated by the heat of pyrolysis

Psensitive to the conditions under which the experiments are per-
formed [19,95,96]. Moreover, it is also the case that many values for
the heat of reaction for primary and secondary devolatilization reac-
tions have been obtained by fitting the heat of pyrolysis to the meas-
urements [8]. This instead suggests that the applied values are again
based on a series of modeling assumptions, rather than being taken
from realistic experiments.

P4.3.4. Independent parallel reactions model

PAccording to Papari and Hawboldt [94], many researchers prefer
to predict the products of pyrolysis by modeling three independent
parallel reactions. This means that they independently model the
degradation of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose [94]. The reaction
scheme is illustrated in Fig. 9.

reactions model, using pre-exponential

PMehrabian et al. [7,10] have implemented the three independent
parallel
factors of
2.202 £ 1012; 1.379 £ 1014 and 2.527 £ 1011 s(cid:1)1 for lignin, cellulose
and hemicellulose degradation, respectively [97]. The corresponding
activation energies for lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose decompo-
sition were 181; 193 and 147 kJ/mol, respectively, experimentally
obtained by Branca et al. [97].

PThe basic assumption for the three independent parallel reactions
mechanism is that components in the mixture degrade the same
way they would if they were decomposing separately [98]. Many
authors have claimed that the degradation processes for hemicellu-
lose and cellulose should be modeled as first-order reactions,
whereas lignin degradation is modeled as a higher order reac-
tion [99]. However, this is not a common consensus, since it is more
commonly assumed that the degradation reactions of all pseudo-
components are first-order reactions [98].

PFurthermore, there are only a few studies that also include
extractives in the independent parallel reaction model [20]. One
advantage of such a split into three independent parallel reactions is
that such a model can be applied to a variety of biomass types, since
they differ by mass fractions of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose.
Because these compounds are all handled individually, it is relatively
easy to adjust their fractions and take into account their influence in
the model [100]. However, a more practical point of view causes the
criticism that the modeling of three independent parallel reactions
needs more input parameters (e.g. activation energy, pre-exponen-
tial factors, etc.) than the one-step global mechanism, which are pri-
marily obtained by experiments or previous assumptions [22].

PA main disadvantage of this model

is that the interaction
between cellulose and lignin, as well as hemicellulose and cellulose,
is entirely neglected, even though such interactions have been found
within certain temperature ranges [101]. Before being able to state
whether ongoing cross-reactions limit the applicability of the three
independent parallel reactions model with respect to the thermal
degradation modeling of thermally thick wood particles in combus-
tion environments, it is recommended to experimentally test the rel-
evance of potential cross-linking reactions.

P4.3.5. Broido(cid:1)Shafizadeh scheme

PIn the Broido(cid:1)Shafizadeh scheme, an activated intermediate is
formed, which continues to degrade into tar, char and permanent
gases [102]. The Broido(cid:1)Shafizadeh scheme was originally devel-
oped for cellulose only, thereby suggesting that the initiation reac-
tion leads to the generation of activated cellulose from cellulose. The
activated cellulose will then competitively react to permanent gas,
tar and char in first-order reactions [102]. It is very important to
realize that the formation of the activated intermediate from the
reactant (such as cellulose) is not related to any mass loss [103]. The
principle of the reaction is shown in Fig. 10.

PThe Broido(cid:1)Shafizadeh scheme, which was originally established
for cellulose, has been used for modeling thermochemical wood
degradation, even though in some works pure cellulose was

is based on a mesh-based model, developed by the authors. The model is based on
work by Di Blasi [37], and the same conditions and properties have been used; except
a lower density of 410 kg/m3, a smaller particle size (1 £ 1 £ 3 cm3) and the varying
set of kinetic data tested for three independent competitive reaction scheme models.
The external heat flux heating up the wood log is 70 kW/m2 (perpendicular to the
grain). The heat flux to the boundary of the wood log was constant. The permeability

Pof the primary devolatilization reaction of beech wood, which was
found to vary between(cid:1)156.1 and 145.3 kJ/kg [95]. The range of vari-
ation for the secondary pyrolysis reaction for beech wood is more
narrow, only ranging from(cid:1)65.7 to 17.3 kJ/kg [95]. Since beech wood
can be assumed to represent hardwoods, one can also discuss the
variation in the heat of pyrolysis for the degradation of spruce as a
softwood species. In this case, the heat of pyrolysis of the primary
degradation reactions ranges from 41.9 to 387.3 kJ/kg, while the sec-
ondary reactions range from(cid:1)60.8 to(cid:1)23.8 kJ/kg [95]. One of the rea-
sons for these significant spans of values is that the experimental
determination of heat of reaction of devolatilization reactions is very

constant increases as the temperature increases. The kinetic data discussed was applied for modeling different wood species. Even though there will most commonly not be a

Pmodeled [36,39]. This model
is typically applied based on the
assumption that wood can be modeled as pure cellulose, since holo-
cellulose accounts for 75% of the wood [39], and it has already been
applied for modeling thermochemical degradation of birch [41]. The
typical reaction products resulting from lignin decomposition, which
are mostly phenolic compounds, cannot be predicted with this
model. One instead expects that even a more simplified scheme,
based on the actual degradation of wood as a mixture of cellulose,
hemicellulose, lignin and extractives results in a more accurate
model of thermal conversion than the Broido(cid:1)Shafizadeh scheme.

PFurthermore, it is considered a main disadvantage that the reac-
tion forming the activated intermediate, is considered less important
at low temperatures, since based on new kinetic measurements, it
has been found that such reactions are superfluous at 250 to
370 °C [37].

PFurthermore, the kinetic parameters required for deriving the
chemical reaction rate constant for the conversion stage of wood to
the activated intermediate can hardly be derived experimentally.
This conclusion agrees with what has been stated by Mamleev
et al. [103], who claimed that the reactions related to the Broido(cid:1)
Shafizadeh scheme cannot be easily found experimentally, and
interpretations of experimental results are difficult, since there is no
mass loss related to the conversion to activated intermediate and it
seems arbitrary to define when the activated intermediate has been
created. From a more practical point of view, the Broido(cid:1)Shafizadeh
scheme also does not provide advantages compared to the more
suitable three independent parallel
the
three independent competitive reactions scheme, since in all cases
three kinetic rate constants have to be determined. Due to these

Pfacts, one cannot identify any major advantages or strengths of the
Broido(cid:1)Shafizadeh scheme.

P4.3.6. Ranzi scheme

PA multi-step lumped mechanism for the pyrolysis of woody bio-
mass has also been developed by Ranzi et al. [27]. The most impor-
tant aspects of this model are a detailed description of the parent
biomass fuel, the devolatilization of it and its products. A simplifying
assumption of the model is that similar components are grouped
together, and related reactions are lumped together but in more
detailed sub-groups of educts, products and reactions than the pre-
viously discussed models. This aims to sufficiently well balance the
computational cost of modeling devolatilization and the accuracy of
the predictions [27].

PCellulose reacts to activated cellulose, levoglucosan, hydroxy-
acethaldeyde (HAA, C2H4O2), glyoxal (C2H2O2), CO, CH2O, CO2 and
char, as well as H2O in a number of reactions [27]. Levoglucosan is
the main product at lower temperatures. At higher temperatures,
the formation of other products such as HAA is dominant. Hemicel-
lulose reacts to intermediates that subsequently decompose with
different activation energies and charring propensities. One of the
intermediates can form xylose, which is one of the primary compo-
nents of the tar fraction. In addition, a number of species contribut-
ing to the permanent gas fraction are also released from the
intermediates. Lignin is described by three sub-categories, which are
either rich in carbon, oxygen or hydrogen, while the main products
from lignin degradation are phenol and phenoxy species [27].

PAdvantages of the Ranzi scheme are that a broad range of volatile
species can be predicted, with levoglucosan being the main product,
due to high percentages of cellulose in both hardwood and softwood.
Additionally, permanent gases such as CO, CO2, H2, CH4 and C2H4 can
be predicted. Alcohols, carbonyls, phenolics and water vapor can
also be predicted. Moreover, the model can be applied to describe
hardwood or softwood devolatilization, since the parent fuel can
also be described in detail based on defining the contributions by its
three main pseudo-components. It is also claimed that the model is
applicable for a broad range of operational conditions, which enhan-
ces is applicability. One disadvantage is that secondary gas-phase
reactions forming char are not included in the model, since char is
only derived either from lignin or cellulose in the chemical wood
structure, or the activated intermediates of cellulose and hemicellu-
lose. Another weakness of this model is that the presence of extrac-
tives or inorganics, and their catalytic effect, are neglected.

PNevertheless, it is known that minerals contained in the parent fuel
have an effect on the char yield, and can even catalyze cellulose and
hemicellulose fragmentation [18]. Moreover, no nitrogen-containing
species are included in the list of predicted products, i.e. the pres-
ence of fuel-bound nitrogen is also entirely neglected. The interac-
tion between cellulose and lignin, as well as hemicellulose and
cellulose, is neglected, even though, as previously mentioned, at
temperatures comparable to temperatures in wood stoves, cross-
linked reactions cannot be fully excluded. With respect to numerical
efficiency it is also assumed that this model has its drawbacks. It is
concluded that due to the increased number of modeled equations
(compared to e.g. three independent competitive reactions model or
the three independent parallel reactions model), the CPU time per
time step is larger.

P4.3.7. Other schemes

PIn Table 3, there is an extra column for “other schemes” and in
this category some less common reaction schemes are listed. Alves
and Figueiredo [34] modeled six parallel reactions. They provided
kinetic data for cellulose and hemicellulose degradation, and further
provided kinetic data for four additional reactions describing degra-
dation of parts of the phenolic lignin macromolecule. Their kinetic
data was obtained from isothermal TGA experiments performed
with pine wood sawdust, with a particle size range of 180(cid:1)595 mm.
The temperature range was very broad (265-650 °C), and accord-
ingly the kinetic data obtained is less restricted in its validity. One
has to consider though, when using this set of kinetic data for large
wood log modeling, that this set of kinetic data has originally been
derived for thermally thin particles, and that experimentally derived
correlations are needed to validate this model for thermally thick
particles. Because the kinetics were originally derived for pine saw-
dust, a correlation was implemented [34] that was aimed to convert
the mass loss obtained with the kinetics for thermally thin particles
to the mass loss of large particles. The experimentally determined
final char yield of large particle conversion entered this correlation
as an empirical factor.

PWurzenberger et al. [45] based their devolatilization model on
work by Alves and Figueiredo [34], and therefore also split the solid
into various species that react in parallel. However, the kinetics for
those reactions were taken from a TGA test, with a heating rate of
5 K/min and a beech wood particle of 1 mm, where the peak temper-
ature of the tests was 1173 K [104]. The heat of pyrolysis was chosen
such that it was correlated with a final char yield, as it was said that
the actual value of heat of pyrolysis depends on wood species, parti-
cle size and the final char yield [45]. This broad dependency empha-
sizes again that it is very challenging to apply suitable values for the
heat of reaction, and that the model is rather sensitive to this input
data.

PLarfeldt et al. [41] also implemented a reaction scheme with four
independent parallel reactions, but it is not clearly stated which
wood compounds are described by this degradation mechanism.
They showed that a scheme with four independent parallel reactions
was able to predict the correct devolatilization temperature for their
application, while other models (one-step global mechanism, Broi-
do(cid:1)Shafizadeh and three independent
competitive reactions
scheme) over-predicted the initiation temperature of the devolatili-
zation process. Even though the three independent competitive
reactions scheme can be considered as an advanced devolatilization
model, it is less advanced than the four independent parallel reac-
tions model.

PBabu and Chaurasia [48], as well as Sadhukhan et al. [58], based
their devolatilization model on two competing reactions. In case of
Sadhukhan et al. [58] the frequency factors and activation energies
for secondary tar reactions were obtained by fitting the measured
mass loss data of the tested wood sphere. The definition of the heat
of reaction for secondary tar reactions was done in the same manner.

PTherefore, doubt arises concerning the broad applicability of this
model, as it appears to be significantly attached to the experiments
it was validated against. Furthermore, this two-competitive reac-
tions model only splits between gases and char, and even though
changing operational conditions will affect the predicted yields of
gases and char, such a variation in operational conditions cannot be
linked to varying yields of tar and permanent gas. In order to know
the yields of tar and permanent gases, one has to set a predefined
ratio that does not vary with operational conditions.

PShen et al. [54] also modeled two independent competitive reac-
tions yielding char and gases. It is not specified if this gas fraction
included permanent gas and tar, but based on the applied kinetic
data, one assumes that only permanent gas is modeled. Kinetic data
by Thurner and Mann [89] was used, which was originally derived
for the three independent competitive reactions scheme. In the
work by Shen et al. [54], tar formation was therefore neglected. For
this reason, it is concluded that both product yields and conversion
times cannot be computed correctly. The same reaction principle
was used by Koufopanos et al. [35], who added one consecutive sec-
ondary reaction, in which primary char and gases could react to sec-
ondary char and gases. For modeling secondary reactions they
required a deposition coefficient that described the fraction of gas
species deposited on char sites. This coefficient is a function of resi-
dence time inside the degrading particle, so it is also dependent on
particle dimensions.

PMelaaen [38] used a devolatilization model suggested by Glais-
ter [105], which differs slightly from the common three independent
competitive reactions scheme. In the model by Glaister, the solid
parent fuel can also react to water vapor. In this model, the formed
tar does not exit the particle immediately, since consecutive tar
cracking reactions occur. However, the disadvantage of these sec-
ondary reactions is that one has to predefine a factor defining how
much permanent gas, tar and water vapor are produced by such a
consecutive cracking reaction. This again limits the applicability of
the model, since such values do not consider changing operation
conditions well enough. In addition to the predefined coefficient for
splitting the products of the secondary tar cracking reactions, even
more empirical values are required, since the other two reaction
pathways forming permanent gas or char also produce water vapor
simultaneously. Hence, one can conclude that this model, even
though a broader range of products can be predicted, has to be
applied with caution, since the application of such a predefined coef-
ficient for conditions different from what they have been obtained
in, can lead to false predictions.

PKwiatkowski et al. [61] assumed that wood does not react
directly to char, but instead is converted to an intermediate solid,
also referred to as temporary char, which then reacts to form the
final char. However, since there is no clear definition of what is
defined as char and how it differs from temporary char, such a classi-
fication seems ambiguous. One also cannot evaluate how the corre-
there was no clear
lating kinetic data has been obtained if
differentiation between temporary char and char. A reaction model,
following the same concept as suggested by Kwiatkowski et al. [61],
has been introduced by Pozzobon et al. [62]. Kwiatkowski et al. [61]
performed their own experiments on compressed wood shavings in
order to obtain kinetic data. However, according to the given mate-
rial properties, e.g. a density of 750 kg/m3, it is found that the sample
of compressed wood shavings behaves comparably to an undensified
wood sample.

PVery simplified devolatilization models of a dry wood particle,
also available in the current literature [59], model the devolatiliza-
tion based on the assumption of a constant devolatilization tempera-
ture. The rate of devolatilization was accordingly linked to a constant
pre-defined temperature, which acted as a boundary value between
virgin dry wood and char. The decomposition rate was linked to the
initial biomass density and the time-dependent evolution of the

Pchar layer thickness. The disadvantage of this model is that detailed
knowledge about the devolatilization products cannot be obtained,
since only the overall thermal conversion time and the final residue
can be obtained as model results. Moreover, the choice of pyrolysis
temperature is ambiguous as this value highly varies with wood spe-
cies, as well as heat flux [59].

PA large number of devolatilization models are available. All of
them are related to simplifications, but the degree of simplification
differ significantly. It is clear that an extensive research focus, both
modeling and experimental, is on devolatilization. The research
within the field of devolatilization is more intense than within the
other thermal conversion stages; drying and char conversion.

4.4. Char conversion

PThe solid product of the devolatilization process is a mixture of
ash and mainly carbon, which further reacts as combustion pro-
ceeds. Modeling char conversion is challenging since heterogeneous
reactions, which are influenced by mass transfer and kinetics, have
to be modeled. When a particle with a low ash content, such as
wood, is reacting, it will also shrink in size as the reactions pro-
ceed [106]. The gaseous products of char conversion will exit the
reaction surface, and are transported into the freeboard by convec-
tion and diffusion. The carbon will primarily react with oxygen and
form CO2 and CO. Depending on the temperature and pressure con-
ditions and the gas composition, the following reactions can be
related to gasification and char oxidation [23]

PCommonly applied kinetic data for the previously discussed char

oxidation and gasification reactions are mentioned in Table 4.

PThe stoichiometric ratio, V, in Table 4 relates the moles of carbon
to the moles of oxygen. Oxidation reactions of various ratios can be
generically described by the reaction in Table 4 (listed in the first and
fifth column). As one can see from Table 4, the same kinetic data is
commonly used for char conversion. However, this entirely neglects
that char reactivity is affected by operational conditions of a thermal
conversion process. A higher heating rate would result in a highly
porous and reactive char, with an extremely damaged structure,
which is due to a fast and sudden gas phase release [107] compared
to slower heating rates, as in the case of large particle heating. Such

Pa variation in reactivity cannot currently be reflected well enough, as
in current models similar kinetic data is used for the most common
oxidation and gasification reactions independent of the previous dry-
ing and devolatilization history of the particle. Yang et al. [57] stated
that the kinetics will vary with the potassium content in the wood. It
is also interesting to note, that in their approach the diffusion of oxy-
gen is implicitely included in the kinetic expression.

PThe kinetics of char conversion are one of the most significant
uncertainties in the current modeling of thermal conversion of ther-
mally thick woody biomass particles. Using always the same kinetic
data for char conversion does therefore not allow the consideration
of the influence of varying operational conditions, e.g. pressure or
residence time of char at certain temperatures, in a model. Further-
more, the influence of catalytic ash elements can hardly be correctly
modeled. Because the diversity of available literature on single bio-
mass particle combustion data is limited [78], this is recommended
as a field of future research.

P4.4.1. Mathematical modeling of char conversion

PChar conversion is either kinetically or mass transfer controlled.
The kinetically controlled regime is predominant at low tempera-
tures, whereas the mass transfer controlled regime is dominant at
higher temperatures. In addition to this, the mass transfer controlled
regime is more important for larger particles, because intra-particle
and external mass transfer are much slower than chemical reac-
tions [52,53,61]. A limited mass transfer means that the gas reactant
penetration into the particle is limited. Char conversion is heteroge-
neous and the rate at which conversion occurs is calculated based on
intrinsic kinetics, the oxygen diffusion rate as well as the evolution
of the specific surface area that is available for reactions [60]. The
mass fraction of oxygen, YO2 is required to be determined if the rate
of char conversion is aimed to be determined. Mathematically this
can be expressed as [60]

The superscripts “n,1” and “n,2” mark the reaction orders of the cor-
responding reactions. The expressions in Eqs. (37) and (38) enter the
equation for char mass loss calculations Eq. (30) as source terms,
_vgasif Eqs. (37) and (38) show one approach on how gasification
modeling can be done. However, the authors agree more with the
char gasification and oxidation source term definition that was used
by Fatehi and Bai [77].

PThe reaction of char with oxygen is faster than the gasification
reactions for most practical applications. Hence, a common model-
ing assumption is that as long as residual oxygen is in the gas phase,
char gasification reactions can be neglected [5,52,53,60]. Low oxygen
supply rates to the particle result in a complete consumption of oxy-
gen by the char and the leaving gas phase. A higher oxygen supply
rate means that the reactions are limiting [108]. Accordingly, a
model has to be flexible, such that it is valid over a broad range of
operational conditions, which indicates the importance of a simulta-
neous consideration of both mass transfer and kinetic limitations for
char conversion.

PDespite this significant influence of operational conditions on
char conversion, several authors modeled the char oxidation reac-
tion as only diffusion controlled [46,50(cid:1)53]. More flexible works are
available where char conversion is a function of both reaction rate
and mass transfer rate [7,10,44,60], which suggests that these mod-
els are more flexible to varying operational conditions.

PEven though it is theoretically true that char oxidation is always
than gasification reactions, which could therefore be
faster
neglected, it is not possible to pre-define when the critical oxygen
mass fraction in the gas phase will be reached in practical applica-
tions. As a consequence, it is concluded that in order to be able to
model a broad range of operational conditions and possible combus-
tion conditions in a combustion unit, the implementation of both
gasification and oxidation reactions is required. The model is then
recommended to be able to freely model the most dominant reaction
pathway depending on operational conditions.

PIn models where only the reaction of carbon and oxygen with
carbon dioxide as a product (R1) is assumed to describe the char
burnout process; e.g. [5,50,51], the production of CO from char con-
version is entirely neglected. This assumption restricts char conver-
sion to a temperature where CO2 formation is dominant. By far, the
char combustion in the majority of models is based on the reaction
of carbon and oxygen, with both carbon monoxide and carbon diox-
ide as products [7,10,44(cid:1)46,52,53,60]. The ratio between CO and
CO2, h, is commonly modeled as a function of temperature [52,53]

It is assumed that modeling such a temperature dependency of
CO/CO2 increases the model’s accuracy, and also broadens its appli-
cability to a vast range of operational conditions.

PEspecially for large wet particles, it is suggested that the impor-
tance of gasifying reactions with H2O is significant. In a thermally
thick particle, the char layer will build up in the outer zones of the
particle, even though in the core of the wood particle, evaporation
still occurs. The formed water vapor has to pass through the hotter

Pchar layers, so it is reasonable to assume that the water vapor will
react with the char. This of course also applies to CO2 and H2, which
are products of wood devolatilization. These permanent gas phase
species are also formed in the interior of the wood particle, and
accordingly have to pass the hot char layer. A detailed modeling of
leaving water vapor and permanent gas phase reactions with char
are therefore considered essential for accurate prediction of product
yields, both solid and gaseous.

PHowever, gasification reactions described by reactions (R3) and
(R4) have only been taken into consideration in some of the
papers [7,10,44,61]. The formation of methane due to reactions
of char with hydrogen have been included by even fewer
works [7,10,44].

PA further assumption in several models is that char only con-
tains pure carbon [45,46,49(cid:1)53,57,60,61,64]. In reality, char will
also include ash and some reduced mass fractions of H, N and O,
which remain after all the carbon has been consumed. The ash can
build up an additional layer surrounding the particle, which results
in an increasing resistance to mass and heat transfer. When this is
taken into account, additional computations for the ash layer must
be performed [7,10,44].

PFurthermore, besides the influence of ash on mass transfer
modeling, the catalytic influence of impurities on char conversion
has not been modeled in any of the reviewed works. A general con-
clusion on whether considering impurities in a model is hard to
draw, since there will be significant variations between different
biomass species and also the extent to which specific inorganics are
present will vary. However, one can expect that neglecting impuri-
ties is acceptable in the case of large woody biomass particles,
because in larger particles diffusion is primarily controlling char
conversion.

PIt was further found that there is no common approach on how
the specific surface area available for heterogeneous reactions is
modeled. However, the prediction of char conversion is highly
dependent on the specific surface area. Because the formation of
cracks and fissures leads to changes in the surface area, this also sig-
nificantly affects heterogeneous reactions. Galgano et al. [60] consid-
ered the influence of cracks and fissures by introducing an
enhancement factor when describing heterogeneous char conver-
sion reactions. This enhancement factor is rather ambiguous, since it
is not related to any detailed information concerning external and
internal structural changes of a wood particle. Furthermore, it does
not account for the fact that not all gas species can penetrate into
any size of a newly formed opening (less relevant for cracks but
more relevant for pore size), even though an increase of surface area
enhances heterogeneous reactions.

PIt is common in current models to neglect the change in
physical structure of the wood log and therefore the change in
specific surface area. Overall, the change of specific surface area
during thermal conversion, especially during char conversion, is
very complex.

PIn the case of biomass char, it is likely that the pore size increases
monotonously [109]. This contradicts with what is expected from
coal char pore size evolution, since in such a case it is more likely
that pores grow and also suddenly merge, which again results in a
reduction of the specific surface area. It is therefore suggested to
model the specific surface area of the biomass char to continuously
increase during thermal conversion [110]. This can be achieved by
modeling the evolution of the specific surface area which is defined
as [110]

PThe specific surface area is closely linked to the char porosity and
the pore size seems to be a crucial parameter. One can distinguish
between three main pore size groups, which are macro-pores
(dp > 50 nm), meso-pores (dp 1⁄4 2(cid:1)50 nm) and micro-pores
(dp < 2 nm). However, even though the micro-pores contribute
greatly to the specific surface area, they do not influence the overall
conversion significantly, since reactants cannot enter these pores suffi-
ciently well. The complexity in their case is that even though this pore
size category is initially negligible, pore size will increase such that
these pores will eventually become big enough to significantly con-
tribute to conversion. It also has to be pointed out that for different
reactions, different pore sizes are relevant [110]. Hurt et al. [111] also
found that char and CO2 mainly react outside of the micro-pores net-
it was found that O2 cannot enter micro-
work. Furthermore,
pores [112], while H2O can penetrate into this pore size category [113].
It is therefore suggested that pore sizes also evolve differently and that
an accurate description of heterogeneous reactions requires a good
enough description of the available specific surface area.

PA change of availability of reactive surface during reactions was
considered by Wurzenberger et al. [45]. In their definition of reaction
rates of char conversion, the amount of unreacted char was linked to
an experimentally defined exponent, which expressed the change of
reactive sites [114,115]. This experimentally defined exponent is
highly dependent on operation conditions.

PA detailed description of the evolution of the specific surface area
evolution is lacking in current works. In order to reduce uncertain-
ties related to char conversion modeling, a detailed knowledge of
time dependent change of active sites and specific surface area is
required.

PAfter having focused on the main chemical processes of thermal
conversion, the required data for physical characterization of woody
particles are reviewed.

4.5. Dimensionality

PDescribing the thermal conversion of a single thermally thick bio-
mass particle with a one-dimensional model is a very common
simplification [1,5,7,8,10,34,35,37,38,40(cid:1)54,58(cid:1)60,63,64]. Utilizing
a one-dimensional modeling approach effectively reduces both the
complexity and required computation time of the model. On the
other hand, the anisotropic structure of wood cannot be taken into
account by 1D approximations, as this aspect has to be managed
by multi-dimensional modeling approaches. Two-dimensional
[36,39,56,57,62] and three-dimensional [55,61]
single particle
numerical models exist in the literature, but they are rare. A more
detailed discussion on dimensionality of models follows hereafter.

P4.5.1. One-dimensional interface-based models

PIn so-called interface-based models, the chemical reactions and
phase changes take place at the boundaries between different layers
in the particle. The layers are composed of either wet virgin wood,
dry wood, char or ash, and the thickness of these layers is defined by
the available mass of these solid compounds. A pre-requisite for the
interface-based models is that chemical reactions, as well as phase
changes, are much faster than the intraparticle diffusion of heat and
mass. Only then can one assume very sharp fronts, thus indicating
that the reactions are limited to very narrow regions only. These
models can only be applied if the Biot number and thermal Thiele
modulus describing the ratio between characteristic heat penetra-
tion time and devolatilization reaction time are large [8].

PIn the layer model, due to conversion of the fuel particle, solid
matter leaves one layer to enter the layer assigned to the next

Pconversion stage and the drying, devolatilization and char combustion
fronts move from the surface to the center of the particle [44]. Thun-
man et al. [44] adapted the concept of infinitely thin reaction fronts
from Saastamoinen et al. [79] (only done for drying in their work), and
assumed that devolatilization (and char conversion) also occurs in
such infinitely thin reaction zones. This modeling work [44] has been
the basis for a number of following models [5,7,8,10,52,53]. Galgano
et al. [60], called their approximation a “front-based model”, which
still describes the same phenomena as all interface-based models.

PThe layer models are related to a high numerical efficiency and
rather decreased computational cost, mainly due to the fact that
only a somewhat limited number of governing equations is solved,
and also partly due to a rather coarse spatial discretization in the
interior of the wood particle. In fact, only equations for temperature
and mass have to be solved in the layer model. Mehrabian et al. [10]
found that the layer model resulted in the same accuracy as the
much more extensive model by Lu et al. [78,116], who solved a set of
14 governing equations, whereas the layer model by Mehrabian
et al. [10] only contains the energy and the mass equation. At the
same time, their layer model was significantly faster.

PA conclusion is that if the main purpose of the solid phase model
is to be coupled with CFD simulations of large-scale furnaces, in
which a bed has to be modeled, a reduced computational cost is the
most relevant aspect and the layer model is considered a suitable
choice. The solid phase models are also used to describe large wood
log conversion in a heating unit. However, if the purpose of the
wood degradation model is to predict crack formation and the trans-
portation of species inside the pores, the interface-based models are
not suitable. In such cases, mesh-based models are recommended.

PHowever, the low robustness of the interface-based model can
still be considered as a weakness of the model, independent of its
application purpose. The sharp fronts where reactions occur result
in mathematical discontinuities, which may cause numerical insta-
bilities [8].

P4.5.2. One-dimensional mesh-based models

PIn a mesh-based model, the equations for thermal conversion
are related to grid points. The particle is therefore fully discretized.
One-dimensional mesh-based models are applied by many authors
[1,34,35,37,38,40(cid:1)43,45(cid:1)48,54,64] and solve a higher number of
governing equations than the layer model, which inevitably leads to
higher computational costs. Accordingly, these models need to be
significantly simplified if coupled to CFD simulations, and if they are
aimed to be able to compete with the numerical efficiency of layer
models. Nevertheless, if reasonable simplifying assumptions can be
found and computational costs are low, it is assumed that mesh-
based models provide much more information than the layer model,
e.g. since also liquid and gas phase can be modeled in detail.

P4.5.3. Two-dimensional models

PSand et al. [56] as well as some other researchers [36,39,62]
developed a higher dimensionality model, which is rarely done as
the current focus is on 1D. They also considered anisotropy to some
extent and modeled wood logs of very large sizes, which are compa-
rable to what is used in wood stoves. Di Blasi [36,39] has also accom-
plished work within the field of 2D modeling of wood degradation.
By considering anisotropy, one expects an asymmetric velocity field
that affects heat and mass transfer. Di Blasi [39] found that heat con-
duction, both across and along grains, differs. It was found that the
propagation of a devolatilization front inwards is first faster across
the grain direction, because a larger surface heat flux occurs in that
direction. However, the difference between across and along the
grain continuously decreases with time, since for longer times the
influence of convective transport values decreases (less cooling
along the grains). Furthermore, the thermal conductivity across the
grain directions is smaller than the thermal conductivity along the

Pgrain direction. Di Blasi [39] found that 2D and 1D models yield
results that are quantitatively relatively similar. 1D models showed
slightly lower temperatures and velocities of gases in the pores of
the wood particle in the cross-grain direction compared to 2D mod-
els. Consequently, the propagation of a conversion front was pre-
dicted to be slower, the final char density higher and the conversion
times longer. Along the grain direction, 1D models over-predicted
temperatures and velocities, which resulted in faster propagation
speeds and reduced char densities [39].

POverall, it is important to consider that the discrepancy between
1D and 2D modeling results increased with an increasing particle
size, so it is suggested that large wood log modeling requires 2D or
even 3D models [39].

P4.5.4. Three-dimensional models

PThe three-dimensional model of Kwiatkowski et al. [61] was based
on the discretization of a wood cylinder in a mesh composed of hex-
ahedral elements of 0.1 mm, which was found to be sufficient for
solving the temperature gradient inside the particle. Yuen et al. [55]
developed a three-dimensional model for the pyrolysis of wet wood
with a detailed consideration of the drying process, anisotropy and
pressure-driven internal convection of gases. The main disadvantage
of 3D models is the higher computational cost, compared to 1D and
2D models. Higher dimensionality models are recommended if
anisotropy is investigated or the influence of highly varying bound-
ary conditions is considered. Furthermore, due to the fact that radial
and tangential properties do not vary significantly, 3D models will
not necessarily result in a significantly higher accuracy compared to
2D models. However, no comparison between 2D and 3D models has
yet been made, and it is therefore recommended that future research
investigates the difference between these two approaches.

4.6. Feedstock

PFeedstock can vary in many aspects, such as particle size, shape,
density, wood species and therefore also thermo-physical proper-
ties. Different values for certain properties of wood, relevant for
thermal conversion, are used in current models. Some models are
derived for the combustion of wood logs [1,41,49(cid:1)51,56,63] or
smaller wood particles [5,7,8,10,34(cid:1)40,42(cid:1)48,54,55,57(cid:1)62,64] and
others for densified wood [1,52,53]. Even though densified wood
models are partially relevant, since intra-particle gradients are mod-
eled, they are less relevant for wood log-fired heating applications.
Most of the differences between densified and non-densified wood
are due to different fuel properties, such as a higher density for com-
pressed wood, as well as a lower porosity, lower water content and
anisotropy. The thermochemical degradation process of densified
wood will therefore be different from what is expected in wood log
applications.

P4.6.1. Isotropy

PThe assumption of isotropy is rather obvious when the conversion
of densified wood is modeled. The densification process, including
grinding of the wood to sawdust size particles, which is required for
pellet formation, leads to homogeneity in the physical-mechanical
characteristics of solid fuels [23]. Models for densified wood are com-
monly based on the assumption of isotropic conditions [1,7,10,52,53].
Raw wood should be considered an anisotropic material. For unden-
sified wood particles and logs, the isotropic assumption is neverthe-
less applied in many models [5,7,8,10,34,35,37,38,40(cid:1)51,54,57(cid:1)64].
In other works, the anisotropy of wood is taken into consideration
by using a bridge factor [1,56]. This simplified consideration of
anisotropy of wood is based on averaging between parallel-to-the-
grains- and perpendicular-to-the-grains-properties, and does not
account for actual properties that depend on different directions.
This consideration can be considered as an intermediate step

Pbetween the fully isotropic and fully anisotropic modeling of a wood
log. Only a very limited amount of work has been done by actually
implementing anisotropy, and consequently developing a higher
dimensionality model without
the bridge factor
[36,39,55]. E.g. Yuen et al. [55] developed a 3D model, while Di
Blasi [36,39] as well as Pozzobon et al. [62] implemented a 2D model.
Due to this, it is of interest to focus on the influence of anisotropy on
modeling predictions in the future.

the usage of

P4.6.2. Particle shape

PIt has been found that the particle shape has a significant influ-
ence on thermal conversion and that spherical particles have a lower
mass loss rate than non-spherical particles. This is related to the
smaller surface to mass ratio of spherical particles, which results in
lower heat and mass transfer [10]. In the case of the layer model, a
geometrical shape factor is used to model different shapes of the
particle, and it was found that the layer model can sufficiently well
describe the thermal conversion of particles of various shapes [10].

PHowever, there is no model currently available that works with
an irregular shaped particle, and the influence of cracks on thermal
conversion is hardly ever included in a model. The particle shape is
commonly assumed to be well-defined, though this is not the case,
since wood particles are very irregular in most combustion applica-
tions. Therefore, it is of interest to identify how a more realistic
description of particle shape affects the accuracy of the model.

PIt is not only that the virgin wood particles do not have ideal
spherical or cylindrical shapes; the shape of the biomass char par-
ticles can be even more irregular. They are highly affected by the
influence of the lignin structure of parent wood species, and by the
mechanical process applied to form the wood particle [57].

PIt is therefore suggested to include the irregular shape of a
particle undergoing thermal conversion. However, a very detailed
description of the irregular shape of a particle and its evolution over
time is expected to result in high computational cost as this will also
require multi-dimensional models. Consequently, future models are
challenged to find a balanced approach, including the description of
high irregularity of particles while being computational low-cost
models.

P4.6.3. Particle size

PThe size of the particles varies from application to application,
however, all the modeling approaches presented here are derived
for predicting the thermal conversion of thermally thick wood par-
ticles and logs. Sadhukhan et al. [58] investigated a range of different
particle sizes (the maximum being 10 cm and the minimum 1 cm).
Their purpose was to identify the influence of the particle size on the
entire devolatilization process. They found that the particle size has
a significant influence on the history of the residual solid mass frac-
tion, and accordingly the devolatilization time. The particle size
influences when certain conversion stages are reached, even though
the final residue mass fraction does not vary significantly.

PIn a particle thickness range of 0.1 cm - 2.0 cm it was found that
for smaller particles, a high enough heat flux can result in a fast pro-
duction of tar and permanent gas, and the leaving gases leave imme-
diately, resulting in a single peak of leaving mass flow [64]. For
larger particles, two peaks were found for the mass flow leaving the
particle, which is related to an increasing influence of the char layer,
which prevents the pyrolysate from exiting immediately [64].

PVery few numerical simulations [41,56] have been performed on
the thermochemical degradation and combustion of wood logs
with sizes of the order of what is used in domestic wood stoves.
Future work is therefore also encouraged to enhance research
within the field of large wood log modeling. It is of interest to
investigate how such comparably large particles and their shrink-
age affect thermal conversion times and above all product yields, as
it is expected that in case of such large particles the impact of the

Pchar layer building up around the unreacted wood particle center
has a significant influence. It is also assumed that leaving tar has a
much longer residence time within hot char layers, so it is of inter-
est to investigate to what degree the tars are converted within the
char layer.

P4.6.4. Density

PVarious wood species, and therefore also varying densities, are
found in the existing literature. This variation limits the potential
comparison of the modeling results (Table 5).

PBased on a reference literature [33], that provides detailed infor-
mation about wood and its properties, including density, the authors
now investigate if the applied densities, used in current models are
consisted. By investigating if the density is suitable for modeling a
certain wood species, the authors were able to present a database
for different wood species, that can be used for future model devel-
opment. Furthermore, inconsistent values can outline that the model

Pwas fitted to agree with experiments. Bryden et al. [42] modeled
basswood with a density of 420 kg/m3, which deviates slightly from
the reference density of American basswood, which is defined to be
380 kg/m3 [33]. However, it has been concluded that the chosen den-
sity is still suitable for modeling basswood, since it is assumed that
the choice of other fuel properties, e.g. thermal conductivity, will
have a more significant effect on thermal conversion times and
product yield predictions.

PFor beech wood, the values for dry wood density ranged from
680 kg/m3 [7] to 750 kg/m3 [46]. Overall, this span is comparably
narrow, with American beech, as a representative of beech wood,
having a density of 680 kg/m3 [33].

PIn the case of birch wood, it was found that a much broader range
of densities was applied. The value span reached from 410 kg/m3
[41,56] to a maximum of 740 kg/m3 [54,64]. Based on reference val-
ues from the literature for sweet birch and yellow birch, having den-
sities of 710 and 660 kg/m3 [33], respectively, it is concluded that

Table 5

Pthe very low values of 410 kg/m3 [41,56] are not consistent with
what has been reported elsewhere.

PThe higher density of compressed wood compared to uncom-
pressed wood is a good assumption, since a lower porosity is also
expected in densified wood particles due to the densification pro-
cess. The comparably low density found by Kwiatkowski et al. [61]
makes it hard to identify a clear differentiation between uncom-
pressed and compressed wood, as the density is rather typical for
uncompressed wood, while still compressed wood shavings were
tested.

PMaple wood was modeled [37] with a density of 650 kg/m3,
which lies within the range of reasonable maple densities, whereby
the maximum density is 660 kg/m3 (maple, sugar) and the minimum
value 500 kg/m3 (maple, silver) [33]. The density for oak used in
models [60] is also considered a suitable choice, since the overall
values for oak densities found in the reference literature range from
660 to 720 kg/m3 [33].

PWhen comparing the pine density chosen for different mod-
els [34], it was found that the value agrees well with the reference
pine densities [33]. Still, the overall range of potential pine densities
is significant, with a minimum value of 370 kg/m3 and a maximum
value of 620 kg/m3. In case of pine wood modeling, one must there-
fore specify the type of pine wood in more detail and choose the
properties for modeling thermal conversion accordingly.

PWhen modeling poplar,

the applied densities range from
to 545 kg/m3 [7,10]. When compared to reference
460 [50,51]
data [33], the lower density limit agrees with the density of yellow
poplar.

PModeling spruce was done by assuming a density of 450 kg/m3
[40], which exceeds the maximum reference value by 20 kg/m3 [33].
However, it is assumed that this deviation is not very significant,
since the density range of different spruce types ranges from 370 to
430 kg/m3, such that the difference between chosen and maximum
reference value is comparably small. The modeled Redwood densi-
ties [59] agree well, with the reference value for young growth
Redwood being 370 kg/m3 [33].

PWith respect to porosity, the documentation of applied values in
the literature is scarce. Most commonly, only apparent densities of
wood are given, and because there is no detailed information on
either the porosity or true density of wood, no back-calculation or
proper discussion can be performed. However, the conclusion is that
if acceptable wood densities are used in the model, both for

Phardwood and softwood, a proper porosity has been chosen as well.
Accordingly, one would expect that since the densities previously
discussed agree well with literature data from the reference litera-
ture [33], the porosities applied in current models are within reason-
able ranges. Fig. 11 shows what porosity is expected when assuming
a true density of 1500 kg/m3 [117] and relating it to the previously
listed apparent densities, such that

(cid:2) 1⁄4 1(cid:1)

rwood apparent
rwood true

ð42Þ

is fulfilled and the corresponding porosity, (cid:2), can be calculated. The
true density, which is the density of the cell walls, is considered to
be the same for different wood species [117], and accordingly the
same true density was used for both hardwoods and softwoods. In
Fig. 11, the porosities listed in some works were also plotted.

PIt is shown in Fig. 11 that porosity increases as density decreases,
which fits with the theoretical understanding of the wood structure,
containing a solid matrix and pores filled with gas (in case of oven-
dry wood). A higher porosity indicates a higher volume filled with
gas phase, which leads to a reduction in apparent density. As stated
earlier, by discussing the agreement of chosen apparent densities in
models with literature data, it was found that porosities also agree
well with what can theoretically be expected for certain wood spe-
cies. It was also found that the applied porosities, given in a limited
number of works, agreed well with what would have been theoreti-
cally expected. When it comes to finding values for densities of dif-
ferent wood species, a broad range of values is available in the open
literature. Accordingly, less uncertainties are expected to be intro-
duced to models, by the choice of wood densities.

P4.6.5. Thermal conductivity

PThe characteristics of wood vary along, across and tangential to
the grains, which also affects heat and mass transfer. Thermal con-
ductivity across- and tangential to the fiber direction is approxi-
mately one-third of the thermal conductivity along the grains [39].
The effective thermal conductivity of green wood is defined as [22]

where kcond and krad are the conductive and radiative contributions,
respectively. The conductive part is a function of the thermal proper-
ties of the fibers, bound and liquid free water and gas [22]

PThe radiative term in the effective thermal conductivity is less
important in green wood but becomes more influential as pore size
increases, which is the case in the char layer. Furthermore, the radia-
tive term in the effective thermal conductivity definition is influ-
enced by the temperature to the power of three, and accordingly in
the stage of char conversion, and for conditions where higher tem-
peratures are expected, this term becomes significant.

PBiswas and Umeki [1] use high conductivity values, but these val-
ues are given for cell walls. Multiplication with porosity leads to the
actual thermal conductivity of dry wood

PIt is also relatively common to combine the parallel and perpen-
dicular thermal conductivities into one effective thermal conductiv-
ity, which is based on a fraction term that indicates the amount of
material perpendicular to the heat flow (1-ξ) and parallel to the heat
flow (ξ). Here, ξ is often referred to as a bridge factor. This modeling
approach has already been discussed when discussing anisotropy
modeling in 1D. The mathematical expression for this correlation is
given as [22]

One of the weaknesses of the bridge factor is that it is actually often
only used to fit modeling results to experimental results.

PThe choice of bridge factor has a significant influence on the tem-

perature profile and conversion time, as shown in Fig. 12.

PThe bridge factor weights the actual thermal conductivity between
a maximum value (parallel to the fiber direction, ξ = 1) and a mini-
mum value (perpendicular to the fiber direction, ξ = 0). The faster
heating related to pure thermal conductivity along the grains leads to
faster conversion times and a lower residual solid mass. This signifi-
cant influence highlights that not only does the value chosen for ther-
mal conductivities have an influence on model accuracy, but also that
the corresponding direction (parallel and perpendicular) influence
heating to a certain extent. The bridge factor is a value that is found
to fit model results to experiments, and a broad range of values is
actually found in the literature [22]. Moreover, the bridge factor does
not provide a detailed description of anisotropy, and is therefore con-
sidered a less complex method that can still provide reasonable pre-
dictions for temperature profiles and mass losses. Concerning a
velocity field this bridge factor is however assumed to result in errors.
PThe most common dependencies of thermal conductivities are
discussed hereafter, which includes the influence of densities and
therefore wood species and temperature

PAs suggested by Simpson and TenWolde [33], it can be seen in
Fig. 13 that the thermal conductivity (across the grain) increases
with the wood density, which is the case for both softwood and
hardwood. This correlates well with the general understanding
that an increasing density is related to decreasing porosity, and
accordingly the influence of the cell wall thermal conductivity
increases, which as such is higher than the thermal conductivity
of the apparent wood. Furthermore, one can clearly see that the
dependency of the thermal conductivity on wood density is simi-
lar for hardwoods and softwoods. When comparing thermal con-
ductivities across the grain used in models (listed in Table 3,
plotted in Fig. 13 in dark blue diamonds) with values found for
oven-dry wood in the reference literature [33] (light blue rectan-
gles), the overall agreement was acceptable. Even though, espe-
cially at higher densities, the values deviate significantly, they
were found to be acceptable, as it was claimed in the reference
data [33] that the actual thermal conductivities can deviate by
about 20% from the listed values (kref, perp plotted in Fig. 13 (light
blue rectangles)). The brownish line presents the trend line for
thermal conductivities along the grain commonly used in models.
One can clearly see that those values are significantly higher than
the thermal conductivity across the grain [33]. The effective ther-
mal conductivities applied in 1D models (see Table 3; marked by
orange triangles in Fig. 13), mostly has a value between the ther-
mal conductivity across and the thermal conductivity along the
grain.

PHowever, because there is no clear trend visible on how the ther-
mal conductivities in the modeling works were chosen, it is sug-
gested that they were chosen in such a way that modeling results
fitted well with the experimental data.

POnly a limited number of works [36,39,55,62] is available in
which the anisotropy of wood was considered by setting different
values for the thermal conductivity of wood and char, depending on
the actual direction of heat flow with respect to the fiber structure
in a multi-dimensional model.

PThe difference between perpendicular and parallel values is sig-

nificant, as shown in Fig. 14.

P2D models, e.g. [62], are based on the simplifying assumption
that the radial and tangential values for thermal conductivity do
not differ significantly. Accordingly, it was said that a 2D model
will yield an acceptable accuracy. This difference in thermal con-
ductivity depending on the direction in the wood log, suggests
that accurate consideration of this property can only be done by
multi-dimensional models.

significantly influence the accuracy of a model. The tested model was developed by the authors.

Fig. 13. Thermal conductivity dependency on wood density for hardwood and softwood. The reference data used in this figure has been taken from Simpson and TenWolde [33]
(kref, perp, light blue rectangles and trend-line). The residual data has been collected from models where it was given together with a wood species, listed in Table 3. If the wood
species was not given, or no constant value of thermal conductivity of virgin wood was used, the value was not added to the figure. The thermal conductivities used in models
plotted here were taken from [22,36,37,39(cid:1)41,46,50,51,55(cid:1)57,60,62,64]. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web
version of this article.)

PThe thermal conductivity of wood has quite often been described
as a function of
temperature, while other dependencies are
neglected. Density dependencies have only been added by Bryden
et al. [42,47] and Hagge and Bryden [43]. It has, however, not been
modeled how this relation between thermal conductivity and wood
density changes as wood density changes due to thermochemical
degradation. Still, it can be assumed that it is a fair enough approxi-
mation in that case to model the change of thermal conductivity, as
a linear interpolation between the thermal conductivity of wood
and char such that the actual value is only defined by the degree of
conversion. Further dependencies of the thermal conductivity of
wood on either extractives or structural irregularities, which have
been found for wood material [33], have not been included in any of

Pthe applied thermal conductivities for wood used in models listed in
Table 3. Future research could therefore investigate how extractives
and structural irregularities influence the modeling results, and
whether the increased complexity due to their incorporation is bal-
anced by the enhanced accuracy.

PFurthermore, little information is given on the thermal conduc-
tivity of the pyrolysis gas. In [37,40,48,52,53], a thermal conductivity
of 0.026 W/mK for the gas phase was used. In contrast to this, Sand
et al. [56] used the thermal conductivity of propane (0.0176 W/mK)
for modeling the gas phase. Reviewing a number of modeling works
has shown that the thermal conductivity is commonly not adjusted
based on the chemical composition of the gas phase. However, this
simplifying assumption is reasonable, as the influence of the gas

Fig. 15. Different temperature functions of thermal conductivity are compared. Their influence on normalized residual mass, conversion time and core temperature are compared.
The thermal conductivity changed from the one for wood to the one for char as a linear function of the degree of conversion.

Pphase conductivity in relation to the influence of the solid phase
conductivity on the temperature history in the wood log is less
important.

PIn Fig. 15, the temperature function for the thermal conductivity
of wood has been modeled as linearly conversion-dependent. The
dashed line in Fig. 15 corresponds to the thermal conductivity of
Pozzobon et al. [62], who modeled beech. Babu and Chaurasia [48]
did not explicitly mention which wood species was modeled, but
compared with the results by Scott et al. [118] and Pyle and
Zaror [119], who were using maple and pine, respectively. Their
thermal conductivity is presented by the solid line. Again, the
weakness in their model is that they used the same properties for
comparing hardwood and softwood experiments. The dotted line
corresponds to the thermal conductivity used by Mehrabian
et al. [10], who modeled poplar. In all three cases, hardwood was
modeled, although the applied values differed quite a bit. One can
also clearly see that by considering the increasing influence of
formed char, permanent gas and tar, the heat transfer inwards slows
done, as all these products have lower thermal conductivities com-
pared to wood. A very reasonable finding is also that the residual
solid mass is lowest at the highest heating rate (dashed line). In this
case, the char yield decreases as the produced gaseous products
increase. It is therefore clear that the thermal conductivity has a sig-
nificant influence on the prediction of product yields, as well as the
overall devolatilization time, ranging from approximately 100 s
(dashed) to 140 s (dotted) for beech wood modeling when the
thermal conductivity is a function of temperature and degree of con-
version. After having reached the temperature plateau at roughly
680 to 700 K, the residual heating-up seems to be slower than the
initial one (from start until the plateau). The reason for this is that
the second increase is occurring after devolatilization has proceeded,
so therefore only char, permanent gas and tar are left, all of which
have lower thermal conductivities than wood. Accordingly, by only
looking at the temperature increase, one can clearly identify three
different stages: the first stage is related to the pre-devolatiliza-
tion heating of the wood, as the thermal conductivity of wood
dominates the heat transfer; in the second stage, the actual
devolatilization, the endothermic reactions of primary devolatili-
zation, dominate the temperature profile, and the plateau is
formed. The third stage in the temperature increase is slower
than the initial temperature increase, which is due to the lower
thermal conductivities of char, tar and permanent gas, which
dominate the post-devolatilization heating process.

PIn Fig. 16, it is shown how the temperature-dependent thermal
conductivities of char influence the temperature history in the cen-
ter of a wood log, in addition to the overall conversion time.

PA low thermal conductivity (line marked with £ in Fig. 16) yields
a significantly larger amount of residual solid, which seems reason-
able as the temperature increases very slowly and remains at around
typical pyrolysis temperatures ( < 500 °C) for longer times (compare
line marked with £ and line marked with +). Such a slower heating
enhances char formation instead of the formation of permanent gas
and tar. It can also be seen that initially neither the temperature pro-
file nor the mass loss vary significantly by choosing different thermal
conductivities of char. This seems reasonable, as at earlier conversion
times the degree of thermal conversion is limited; thus, the influence
of the thermal conductivity of wood dominates over the influence of
the thermal conductivity of char. In this comparison, the thermal
conductivity of wood has been the same for all four test cases.

PIt is shown in Fig. 16 that the applied thermal conductivities of
char used in current models differ significantly. It is interesting that
two temperature-dependent descriptions of thermal conductivity of
char actually predict that thermal conductivity decreases as temper-
ature increases [35,48,58]. As can be seen, this temperature depen-
dency gives high discrepancy compared to what is obtained by a
constant thermal conductivity or when increasing the thermal con-
ductivity of char with increasing temperature.

PAfter devolatilization reactions have been enhanced significantly
at temperatures at approximately 700 K, the difference in the evolu-
tion of temperature and residual mass increases, thereby highlight-
ing that the increased presence of char makes an accurate prediction
of its thermal conductivity necessary.

PPozzobon et al. [62] were the only ones modeling thermal con-
ductivity of char as a function of T4. However, the overall validity of
this function describing the thermal conductivity of wood has only
been tested in a temperature range of 20 to 600 °C [120], which is
rather low for gasification and combustion conditions. This signifi-
cant change in thermal conductivity with respect to temperature is
also the reason why it is found that using constant values, commonly
around 0.1 W/(mK) [40(cid:1)43,46,47,52(cid:1)56,59,61] is yielding false pre-
diction of the temperature history within the wood log, which can
consequently affect product yield predictions.

Fig. 16. Different temperature functions of thermal conductivity of char are compared. Their influence on normalized residual mass, conversion time and core temperature are
compared. The thermal conductivities were taken from what is used in current models [34,35,48,58]. Furthermore, it was modeled how a commonly chosen constant value for
the thermal conductivity of char differs from temperature-dependent thermal conductivities. Again the authors’ model was applied.

Paim to illustrate the values used, not only for different wood species,
but also for char and gases.

PThe following plots highlight that the choice of wood species is
expected to have a significant impact on the choice of specific heat
capacity, but only a limited amount of different values is commonly
used in models.

PBased on Fig. 17, it is suggested that a linear temperature depen-
dency is a common modeling approach for describing the changing
specific heat capacity of the virgin wood. It was found that the linear
correlation applied by Bryden et al. [42] for oak wood leads to a sig-
nificant increase of specific heat capacity as temperature increases.
Devolatilization is expected to be finished at < 500 °C, and in such
a range the values for specific heat capacity can still increase up to
approximately 3000 J/kgK, which is considered very high. A higher
specific heat capacity of approximately 3500 J/kgK for modeling oak
has also been used [59]. This value exceeds all the other data found
in literature and seems non-physically high. It is also expected that
by pre-defining constant values for specific heat capacity, errors in
the modeling results are significant, because in Fig. 17 it is obvious
that constant values are commonly well below what is predicted
from temperature dependencies. It is also concluded that the choice
of specific heat capacity for wood species is ambiguous, in some
modeling works [42] the same temperature dependency for both
softwood and hardwood is used.

PFurthermore, the same linear dependency applied by Mehrabian
et al. [7,10] for poplar modeling has been used by Grønli and Mel-
aaen [22,40] for modeling Norwegian spruce. Biswas and Umeki [1]
have also used the same correlation when modeling the Katsura
tree, which is classified as hardwood. As far as models based on pine
wood are concerned, the choice of specific heat capacities is very
random, since the specific heat capacity has been set to 1255.5 J/
kgK [42] or 1150 J/kgK [59] in some works, which is significantly
lower than other values, such as 1950 J/kgK [34].

PFrom Fig. 18, it can be seen that the influence of specific heat
capacity of wood on the temperature evolution and mass loss curve
is less significant than the influence of thermal conductivity. It seems
that the product yields with respect to solid residue are not signifi-
cantly affected, even though the conversion time deviates, being
shortest by choosing a lower constant value for the specific heat
capacity of wood. Both temperature dependencies increase linearly,
and there is hardly any difference between the two with respect to
the modeling of the wood log center temperature and mass loss

Pbehavior. It is therefore concluded that the choice of a specific heat
of wood is not the most sensitive parameter affecting accuracy of a
model. A similar behavior is also expected for the specific heat of
char.

PIt is obvious that a broad range of specific heat capacities of char
is used in current models, having a maximum value of 2870 J/kgK at
890 K and a minimum value of 1225 J/kgK at the same temperature.
Commonly linear temperature dependencies for specific heat capaci-
ties are modeled, which is assumed to be mainly due to their sim-
plicity with respect to implementation in numerical codes. The
inconsistency in the chosen value for specific heat capacity of char
leads to the conclusion that this property is considered a main
source of error in current models.

PIt has to be pointed out that the produced char yield, its composi-
tion and therefore also its properties are expected to vary depending
on operational conditions. Accordingly, one expects a broad range of
values. It also has to be pointed out that the parent fuel can also
affect the composition of the produced char; hence, one expects that
this leads to a broad variation in values for specific heat capacities
for char. Nevertheless, the main reason for such an ambiguous
choice of values as shown in Fig. 19 is expected to be due to the gen-
eral lack of data based on a detailed analysis of the char produced
from different wood species. Therefore, future research should focus
more on collecting detailed data on specific heat capacities of char,
depending on varying operational conditions and parent fuels.

PLarfeldt et al. [41] provided the only model where specific heat
capacities for wood and char were calculated from thermal diffusiv-
ity. The relation between thermal diffusivity and specific heat capac-
ity was such that

The final approximation suggests that the influence of the gas phase
can be neglected in the definition of the thermal diffusivity since the
solid phase dominates over the contribution of the gas phase. We
have shown that applying constant values in a model affects the
accuracy of the modeling results. Still setting constant values for
specific heat capacity for wood species, char and gases is a common
modeling approach [34,37,39,51(cid:1)53,56,60,61,64].

PWhen analyzing the specific heat capacities of gases, the span of
values is significant. Moreover, it is also shown in Fig. 20 that the
influence of increasing temperature on the specific heat capacity is

Fig. 17. Specific heat capacities for commonly applied wood species. These figures aim to show that the specific heat capacities of wood are expected to vary depending on the
wood species, and that modeling specific heat capacities as temperature-dependent or constant, can have influence on the modeling results.

Phardly considered in any model. The highest constant value applied,
2400 J/kgK [42,43,47,54] exceeds the lowest constant value by
1300 J/kgK [37(cid:1)39,41,49,52,53,56] so it is also assumed that the
modeling results are affected by the choice of specific heat

Pcapacities. Yet, the overall influence of the specific heat capacity of
gases is negligible compared to the influence of specific heat capaci-
ties of solids, since the effective specific heat capacity influencing
the heat equation is mass-averaged. For this reason, the higher mass

ature are also compared. The values of specific heat capacity have been taken from reference literature [33] and models [10,37].

Pof the solids leads to a higher influence on the specific heat capaci-
ties.

PFurthermore, the specific heat capacity of gases should consider
the composition of the gas phase. Detailed knowledge of this compo-
sition cannot be easily acquired, since the reacting wood already
includes a broad range of chemical compounds. As detailed knowl-
edge on gas phase composition is commonly not included in current
numerical models, a corresponding value for specific heat capacity
of the gas mixture is also related to approximations.

P4.6.7. Permeability

PThe gas flow inside the wood particle is strongly affected by the
wood structure, which consists of a large number of small pores. The
pore walls act as a barrier for the bulk flow moving from one neigh-
boring pore to another [56]. The permeability is much lower in radial
and tangential directions than along the wood grain.

POne expects differences in permeability, not only between virgin
wood and char, but also between hardwood and softwood. It can be
seen from Fig. 2 that softwoods have slightly lower densities, as the
plotted range is from 330 - 620 kg/m3, while hardwoods have higher
densities, ranging from 370 to 770 kg/m3. It has to be pointed out
that some wood species within these two groups can be either below
or above the range limits mentioned here, though most of the spe-
cies will have densities within these limits. Accordingly, it can be
assumed that softwoods have either more pores or a larger pore
size, since both would contribute to lower apparent wood densities.
Thus, one would assume that the permeabilities of softwood are
higher than the permeabilities of hardwoods.

PAs can be seen from Fig. 21 only limited conclusions can be
drawn in case of softwoods, as very few models were based on soft-
woods and included the influence of convection on heat and mass
transfer; and thus had to provide information on permeabilities. As
previously mentioned, it is concluded that the choice of permeability

Pis still related to a high uncertainty, which can also be seen from the
large spread of data points in Fig. 21. Bryden et al. [42] used the
same permeabilities for softwood and hardwood. One reason for this
might be that the overall availability of data on wood permeabilities
is rather limited. However, it can still be seen that the lowest perme-
(cid:1)17 m2, which is
ability for hardwood is as low as approximately 10
much lower than what has been used for modeling softwoods. This
agrees with a previous theoretical conclusion, that flow is more facil-
itated in softwoods. With respect to char permeabilities, however,
no significant differentiation between hardwood and softwood
derived chars can be found in the literature. Still, it can clearly be
seen that due to an increasing porosity in char compared to wood,
the permeability of char is much higher than the permeability of vir-
gin woods.

PA reasonable choice of permeability is needed in order to cor-
rectly compute the pressure field in the interior of the wood particle.
Furthermore, it has to be pointed out that due to the anisotropy of
wood, it is recommended to at least develop a 2D model, because
different values for permeability with respect to the fiber direction
can then be applied. It is consequently assumed that the pressure in
the interior of the wood particle can be predicted more accurately
and consequently also the velocity field. This has not been a primary
concern in past research, even though it is assumed that the correct
prediction of the pressure results in a good prediction of crack for-
mation. Such an accurate prediction of the physical change of the
wood particle can affect the modeling results of overall conversion
times and product compositions as well as temperature history.

PHowever, it has been found that the choice of permeability is a
major uncertainty of thermal degradation and combustion models
for wood particles.
It has also been the case in a number of
works [39] that the permeability was simply defined by fitting the
modeling results to the experiments. If so, the physical validity of
the used permeability cannot be taken for granted.

P4.6.8. Shrinkage modeling

PThe ratio between the decreased dimension and the initial
dimension is what is defined as shrinkage [43]. Shrinkage during
devolatilization varies with respect to the direction in the wood log.
Because of this, shrinkage can only be accurately replicated in a 3D
model, while 1D models instead focus on shrinkage in only one pref-
erential direction, e.g. commonly radially in the case of cylindrical
wood logs or particles. Such a simplifying assumption is commonly
done in a number of 1D models, e.g. [1,43,61]. Then again, none of
these works focuses explicitly on the distortion of a wood particle
during volumetric shrinkage. Therefore, future research is recom-
mended to focus on such physical changes in wood particles to help
identify the extent to which they affect heat and mass transfer and
the structure and shape of wood logs.

PThere are two different and broadly used approaches for model-
ing the shrinkage of a particle during devolatilization. The first
shrinkage model was introduced by Di Blasi [37], and is based on
three parameters. The main assumption of this model is that the vol-
ume first occupied by the solid is linearly reduced with the wood
mass, while it is increased by the increasing char mass. The correla-
tion describing to what extent the volumetric shrinkage is increasing
linearly with the char mass is described by the first shrinkage factor,
a. Also, the gas volume contribution to the entire volume changes
during devolatilization. The gas phase volume includes two contri-
butions by itself, which are the initial gas phase volume and the frac-
tion b, describing which amount of the solid volume is added to the
gas phase volume due to conversion reactions. The third parameter
of the shrinkage model, g, accounts for internal structural changes,
such as a porosity increase as devolatilization proceeds [20]. Accord-
ingly, these three parameters are not related to the common defini-
tion of shrinkage factors as described by Hagge and Bryden [43]. A
significant uncertainty of this three-parameter model is that the
choice of values for the three parameters is rather ambiguous. They
are not derived from any experiments, but are chosen to fit the
model to the experimental data. Additionally, it is not yet known
whether these three parameters are affected by intra-dependencies
or not, even though the current version of the shrinkage model
assumes that a, b and g are independent from each other [18].

PHagge and Bryden [43] used a one-parameter approach for
modeling shrinkage. The basic idea of this model is the constant
intrinsic densities of char and wood, and shrinkage is assumed to lin-
early depend on the degree of conversion of the solid. This does not
entirely agree with experiments, in which it was shown that shrink-
age commences later than the mass loss during devolatilization
reactions [121,122]. In order to express this correlation, the shrink-
age factor is introduced, which can mathematically be expressed
as [43]

f 1⁄4 current dimension
original dimension

1⁄4

Dy
Dy0

:

ð48Þ

However, this equation outlines that cracking is commonly not con-
sidered when discussing shrinkage factors, and it further highlights
that in most works such shrinkage factors are related to a certain
direction, e.g. radial or longitudinal. For example, Eq. (48) only con-
siders shrinkage across the grains, since Dx and Dz remain
unchanged. A disadvantage of this shrinkage consideration is actu-
ally that the shrinkage factors have been experimentally obtained by
Bryden and Hagge [47]. The factors were related to the final char
dimensions, which are provided in the final shrinkage values. A sim-
plifying assumption for deriving a suitable mathematical expression
for shrinkage from measured values is therefore obtained by assum-
ing that the char dimensions decrease, but that there is no fragmen-
tation [47]. Accordingly, one can conclude that for the restricted
modeling of shrinkage during devolatilization, the mentioned sim-
plifying assumption yields an acceptable mathematical description
of shrinkage. Even though the mathematical derivation of shrinkage

Pis acceptable, the validity of the overall description of shrinkage is
restricted because of the experimentally derived values for shrink-
age factors, suggesting that these are only valid in a limited range of
operational conditions.

PThe one-parameter model has been applied in many different
works [1,5,8,43,44,47,52,53,58,62]. Sadhukhan et al. [58] found that
particle shrinkage during devolatilization led to a reduced heat
transfer area. As a result, it was found that more heat, mainly
obtained from exothermic secondary tar reactions, was kept inside
the particle, resulting in a higher center temperature of the particle
than the temperature at the surface.

PThe most simplifying assumption, however, is that shrinkage can
be neglected, and that the particle volume therefore stays constant
during drying and devolatilization [22,36,39,40,63]. Nonetheless, it
is assumed that this assumption is not very realistic, since wood
loses roughly 80% of its organic mass during devolatilization; hence,
such a significant conversion of the solid to gas phase is assumed to
have a significant influence on the physical structure of a wood par-
ticle. A critical aspect of neglecting shrinkage in the model is that
the validation of the model against experiments is highly inaccurate,
as shrinkage will always occur in an experimental investigation on
the thermal conversion of wood samples. However, a suitable
assumption for an acceptable validation was presented by Grønli
and Melaaen [40], as they neglected shrinkage in their devolatiliza-
tion model, but compared the results against experiments of spruce
wood, which was heated in parallel with the grain. The reasoning is
that in the axial direction only, a low shrinkage is expected, and it is
most reasonable to compare the obtained experimental results with
a non-shrinkage model.

PShrinkage modeling is usually highly dependent on pre-defined
shrinkage parameters. The derivation of those parameters, com-
monly either experimental or based on assumptions, is a main weak-
ness of current models, as it cannot be easily and flexibly changed to
different operational conditions and wood species.

5. Homogeneous gas phase reactions

PThe released permanent gases, including released combustible
gases obtained from char conversion, enter into the freeboard
(which is the gas phase area above the wood log), where they are
eventually oxidized. The consideration of this homogeneous gas
phase reaction is very significant, as the temperature increase result-
ing from the oxidation further heats up the wood log, so that drying,
devolatilization and char conversion reactions can proceed. Accord-
ingly, a discussion of those reactions is required in connection with a
discussion of the thermal degradation of a solid wood particle in a
combustion unit. Please note that gas phase combustion is also dis-
cussed in connection with a relevant application in the chapter on
small-scale furnace modeling, where particularly turbulence and
combustion models are discussed.

PThe relevant reactions of homogeneous gas phase reactions

are [23]
CO þ 0:5O2 ! CO2;

ðR6Þ

which is commonly considered in the freeboard of current domestic
wood heating appliances [50,51,123(cid:1)126]. In some cases, the com-
plexity of the homogeneous reaction model is further enhanced by
also considering CO2 dissociation [124]. This reaction is only relevant
at very high temperatures though. Hydrogen oxidation;
H2 þ 0:5O2 ! H2O

ðR7Þ

has also been modeled in small-scale wood heating applian-
ces [50,51,124(cid:1)127], since it is expected that hydrogen is one of the
main compounds of the volatiles released during the devolatilization
of a wood particle. The increasing importance of H2 with respect to
increasing temperature has been discussed earlier [19], and as such,

Pit seems reasonable that a high temperature conversion processes,
such as that occurring in e.g. wood stoves, requires the explicit con-
sideration of this homogeneous gas phase reaction.

PRegarding combustion of methane it can be modeled in two dif-

ferent ways, either as a full oxidation [50,51,127];
CH4 þ 2O2 ! CO2 þ 2H2O

or as a partial oxidation, as is done by Porteiro et al. [124];
CH4 þ 3
2

O2 ! CO þ 2 H2O:

ðR8Þ

ðR9Þ

Huttunen et al. [126] also described incomplete oxidation of meth-
ane to carbon monoxide, similar to what is shown in equation (R9).

PIn addition to modeling light hydrocarbon oxidation, such as the
oxidation of methane, more complex hydrocarbon structures than
methane can also be included in homogeneous gas phase modeling,
e.g. [124]
C6H6 þ 15
2

O2 ! 6 CO2 þ 3 H2O;

ðR10Þ

which is modeling the combustion of heavy hydrocarbons released
from a wood particle undergoing thermal conversion.

PIn addition to the previous reactions, the water-gas-shift reaction

CO þ H2O ! CO2 þ H2

ðR11Þ

is also of interest [50,51,126], as it can be important for staged com-
bustion units that have more gasifier-like conditions in the primary
stage.

POnly in a limited number of works has a differentiation in homo-
geneous gas phase modeling been done by modeling saturated and
unsaturated hydrocarbons. Saturated hydrocarbons contain only sin-
gle bonds, while unsaturated hydrocarbons can also contain double
or triple bonds. Tabet et al. [128] assumed that the released satu-
rated hydrocarbons (CHX1 ) decompose to unsaturated hydrocarbons
(CHX2 ), which then react to CO. This CO is then combusted to CO2. In
addition, nitrogen containing species are released from the degrad-
ing wood particle, and consequently, NOx formation has to be mod-
eled.

5.1. NOx formation

PSo far, none of the described reactions consider the influence of
nitrogen-containing gas phase species. The influence of fuel-bound
nitrogen is relevant when modeling thermal wood degradation and
combustion, as the parent fuel contains a certain amount of nitrogen.
The nitrogen released from the wood during devolatilization and
char conversion is not considered in any of the single particle mod-
els. Not even the detailed Ranzi scheme [27] can describe the release
rate of either NH3 or HCN from wood, which will be the main precur-
sors for NOx (from fuel-bound nitrogen). Some researchers devel-
oped post-processing [129] models
formation. This
simplification can be justified because NOx reactions have very little
influence on the combustion nor the fluid itself.

for NOx

PDue to the relatively complicated formation mechanisms of NOx,
it is generally required to use detailed reaction kinetics in order to
obtain reasonably accurate predictions of the NOx formation. With
respect to modeling of detailed gas phase reactions, it is, however, a
common approach to reduce the actual number of reactions and spe-
cies. This reduction has to be based on the relevant conditions and
accuracy requirements. This reduction of a detailed mechanism to a
skeletal mechanism can be a very efficient approach to reduce com-
plexity and computational cost of a model, but still obtain a high
enough accuracy when it comes to model predictions. Bugge
et al. [13,130] compared a detailed reaction mechanism including 81
species and 1401 reactions with more simplified skeletal mecha-
nisms, developed by Løva
s et al. [131], with only 49 species and 36
species. The detailed mechanism fully describes the interaction

(cid:5)

Pbetween nitrogen species and hydrocarbons. One main finding was
that the results of the skeletal mechanism including 49 species was
close to the results of the detailed mechanism including 81 species,
whereas the mechanism including 36 species deviated significantly
from the results of the other two reaction mechanisms. In the case of
36 species, the formation of NO2, HCN, NO, NH3 and N2O was over-
predicted [13]. In fact, the skeletal mechanism including 36 species
agreed with the detailed mechanism including 81 species only at
very high temperatures (about 1073 K), while at lower temperatures
(about 873 K) NOx was over-predicted. In previous work, where
Bugge et al. [132] only tested a mechanism with 36 species, they
found that the prediction of prompt NOx was overestimated by
20 times with this skeletal mechanism. Thermal NOx was entirely
negligible since the temperatures in the stove were below 1700 K
which indicates that the Zeldovich mechanism does not significantly
contribute to the NOx formation.

PHowever, there are also other modeling approaches on how NOx
prediction originating from fuel-bound nitrogen can be modeled,
without requiring a detailed reaction scheme. Huttunen et al. [126]
assumed that half the nitrogen in the permanent gas phase is NH3,
which is a precursor for NOx, originating from fuel-bound nitrogen.
The rest is assumed to be N2. Furthermore, it is assumed that the
nitrogen in pyrolysis gases and char is proportional to the amount of
char and volatiles in wood and therefore also their ratio. However,
basing NO predictions on this approximation resulted in predicted
emission levels that where five to ten times smaller compared to
what was found in experiments. Accordingly, such a gross simplifi-
cation of the evolution path for nitric oxides, cannot yield accurate
results, even though it has not been tested if better results can be
obtained when modeling HCN and NH3 as NO precursors [126].

PReviewing homogeneous gas phase modeling has clearly shown
that simplifications are not only required for chemical and physical
processes in the interior of the wood log, but are also a significant
aspect for the development of efficient gas phase models. This high-
lights that a computationally efficient simulation tool for wood heat-
ing appliances does not solely rely on a numerically efficient and
accurate solid phase model, but also highly depends on the numeri-
cal efficiency of the gas phase model. The complexity of a model can
for example be reduced by reducing the number of homogeneous
gas phase reactions by lumping heavy and light hydrocarbons into
two representative species. A higher number of homogeneous gas
phase reactions is expected to result in a stiffer system of equations.
For a numerically efficient simulation tool, it is required to reduce
the number of stiff equations, such that the computational cost is
balanced with accuracy. This principle accounts for the devolatiliza-
tion modeling of wood, as well as the homogeneous reactions of the
released volatiles species.

5.2. Theory of soot formation and its modeling

PThere is only a limited amount of works available that discuss
soot formation from biomass conversion processes, either experi-
mentally or by modeling. Yet, it is clear that soot formation is a key
aspect of an accurate wood heating appliances simulation tool, as
soot in the flame intensifies radiant heat transfer between gases and
wall such that the gas temperature decreases [126]. The parent fuel
will have a significant influence on the soot production; therefore,
soot formation models for liquid and gaseous hydrocarbon fuels are
not applicable for biomass.

PWood smoke which is responsible for a high number of deaths
per year, has soot as a primary contributor, and further includes ash
and volatiles. Soot is built up by two components; organic and black
soot. Black soot contains furthermore two components; elemental
soot and condensed organic compounds [133(cid:1)135].

PThe most common description of soot formation is with acety-
lene as a precursor. Acetylene (C2H2) enhances the formation of

Pincreasingly larger ring structures. The process starts with the
abstraction of H from the ring structure by a free H. The products of
the initial step are therefore H2 and an aromatic radical. The aro-
matic radical will then react with C2H2. An additional C2H2 will then
react, and the reaction will lead to cyclization and the formation
of more connected aromatic ring structures [21]. This reaction
sequence is commonly shortened to “hydrogen-abstraction-carbon-
addition”-route (HACA) . The reaction products will be PAH, which
contains one to four-aromatic-ring-structures. According to the
Frenklach model, the soot precursors subsequently start to nucleate
and size growth occurs, which suggests that nucleation occurs
through an association of four-aromatic-ring species. First soot pre-
cursors are formed, and this initializing stage is followed by nucle-
ation and surface growth. Larger spherical particles are formed,
which then cluster together and by agglomeration form chains [136].
However, as the particle grows, the forming particles are also
affected by oxidation reactions [21]. Accordingly, both formation
and consumption are relevant and define the final soot yield.

PHowever, with respect to soot formation from degrading wood,
soot can be synthesized via an additional reaction pathway
[137,138], in which it is suggested that biomass devolatilization
fragments react further. This formation mechanism of soot has been
found relevant for species adsorbed onto the soot particle, as they
seem to be intermediates between small oxygenated biomass devo-
latilization compounds and the large structures of soot.

PIt is suggested that cyclopentadiene (CPD) can be a precursor for
an additional PAH formation route [136]. Cyclopentadiene is formed
via primary reactions of phenols (therefore lignin compounds), in
which CO is eliminated from the initial chemical structures in wood,
such that CPD is formed, as well as its methyl derivatives [139(cid:1)141].
Further pyrolysis of CPD then leads to the formation of benzene, tol-
uene, indene and naphtalene [142(cid:1)145]. In a more simplified expla-
nation, one can mention the following steps as part of the second
soot-formation route; wood degrades into decomposition products
(mostly from lignin), that can then continue reacting according to
the traditional HACA-soot-formation root, or form oxygen-contain-
ing aromatic species and char. The oxygen-containing aromatic spe-
cies can further react and form soot.

PMost interesting is that the original formation pathway of HACA
does not consider oxygen-containing PAH, as it only considers PAH
based on four-aromatic-ring structures. When modeling the second
reaction pathway, one can also accurately consider C/O ratios in the
soot. It was also generally found that PAH formation and destruction
is very sensitive to the C/O ratio in the parent fuel and the tempera-
tures of the thermal conversion processes. Furthermore, with
respect to common temperatures in combustion units (1220 K), it
was also found that such high temperatures, as well as the time dur-
ing which the temperature remains at such a high level, influence
the PAH/soot formation [146]. An additional influence on soot for-
mation is the ratio of O2 / CO2 in the combustion atmosphere, since
this ratio has a significant influence on the temperature profile of
the particle, which can then affect the amount of soot formed [147].
Most interesting, however, is that Wijayanta et al. [148] claimed that
biomass soot formation modeling can be based on previous model-
ing work done on soot formation from coal. One would not expect
this, since there is a significant difference in the composition of
wood and coal; hence, C/O and C/H ratios are assumed to be differ-
ent, which is expected to have some effect on soot formation.
Wijayanta et al. [148] developed a soot formation model for biomass,
in which 276 species were involved, and 2158 conventional gas
phase reactions were modeled, in addition to 1635 heterogeneous
surface reactions. They based their soot model on previous work
done by Ergut et al. [149] on soot formation from coal conversion.
Ergut et al. [149] assumed an atmospheric pressure, which would
make the model suitable for modeling soot formation in domestic
wood heating appliances, where no significant pressure increase is

Pexpected. In their model, pyrene, naphtalene, methylnaphtalene and
phenol are present in negligible amounts, while most of the species
that can react and form soot are CO, CO2, CH4, acetylene, ethylene
and C2, in addition to C3 alkanes. To some reduced extent benzene
and toluene are considered, but much less significant compared to
the previously mentioned species. To a certain degree, it can there-
fore be concluded that the influence of biomass fragments on soot
formation and the influence of CO elimination from phenol com-
pounds is not considered at all in their model, which again highlights
that it might be suitable for coal, but one expects it to exhibit higher
discrepancies for wood soot formation modeling. By considering
such a detailed description of soot formation, as done by Wijayanta
et al. [148], they were able to identify the influence of temperature
on soot formation. It was found that PAHs formation increases as the
temperature rises from (1073(cid:1)1473 K), but again decreases at
higher temperatures (1678(cid:1)1873 K). Within the first temperature
range, it is assumed that the temperature influences the conversion
kinetics of hydrocarbon polymerization for PAH formation. It is
interesting to note that no soot was found at temperatures below
1473 K, because at these temperatures the oxidation reactions of
soot and PAH are faster than soot growth. Within the second tem-
perature range, temperatures are high enough to enhance PAH oxi-
dation reactions, this is due to enhanced OH radial formation at
these temperatures. It was also found that the pressure in a reactor
system has an insignificant influence on soot formation reactions.

PWith respect to furnace modeling, primarily small-scale heating
appliances, soot formation has only been considered very limitedly
in current models. Bugge et al. [13,130,132] used the Moss and
Brookes soot model [150], in which the primary precursors for soot
formation are acetylene and ethylene. Brookes and Moss [150]
focused on jet diffusion flames burning methane at elevated or
atmospheric pressure. The purpose was to discuss how flame radia-
tive heat losses and soot production rate are linked. Their modeling
followed the conventional HACA pathway of soot formation. Because
this work is not linked to detailed information on soot formation
from biomass, it is considered to go beyond the scope of this work,
and is therefore not discussed in more detail here.

PHuttunen et al. [126] modeled soot formation according to two
different models, whereby one was developed by Magnussen and
Hjertager [151] and Tesner et al. [152], while the other one was
developed at Brigham Young University [153]. However, Huttunen
et al. [126] stated that for solid fuel combustion, the Brigham Young
University model is more suitable, and was consequently linked in
their model to the TULISIJA code. Magnussen and Hjertager [151]
also did not focus on soot formation from the thermal conversion of
wood, but predicted soot formation from C2H2 diffusion flames. Soot
formation in this work occurred stepwise, in which the first stage
was the formation of radical nuclei, while the second stage was soot
formation from these nuclei. Soot combustion in their work was
modeled in regions, where the local mean soot concentration
dropped below the concentration of oxygen. Because the focus of
this work is again gaseous fuels, it is concluded that a detailed dis-
cussion of this soot formation model goes beyond the scope of this
review paper, and the same reason for neglecting a detailed discus-
sion can be applied to the model by Tesner et al. [152]. They also dis-
cussed soot formation from a C2H2 diffusion flame. It was claimed
that soot particles are formed due to branched-chain processes and
the destruction of active particles on the surface of the formed soot
particle [152].

PDue to the limited number of works currently available in the
open literature, it is not yet clear how soot and PAH formation are
influenced by different wood species. Most of the works are on liquid
or gaseous fuels, while wood has not been investigated intensively.
So far, most of the available works concerning soot formed during
thermal conversion of wood have been performed on pine
wood [136,148]. Furthermore, none of the works focused on soot

Pformation from large wood logs. Nevertheless, it is expected that the
size of the woody particle has an influence on soot formation, as it
has been pointed out by Liu et al. [147] that the temperature history
of the particle influences soot formation. Since entirely different
temperature histories are expected for large and small particles, it is
clear that the particle size has an influence. It is also expected that
particle shape has an impact on soot formation, as the external sur-
face area of the particle exposed to heat also has an influence on the
heating history of the wood particle. Future research is therefore rec-
ommended to confront these unknown components of soot forma-
tion occurring during thermal wood conversion in small-scale wood
heating appliances.

6. Small-scale furnace modeling

POnly a limited amount of works has been done on small-scale
furnace modeling [13,14,50,51,123,125(cid:1)128,130,132,154,155]. The
most challenging difficulty of current works is the enormous compu-
tational effort of common CFD models, since a very fine mesh is
required, where steep gradients can be expected and very detailed
reaction mechanisms are needed to model combustion chemistry
sufficiently well [124]. In the following chapter, the current state-of-
the-art of small-scale heating appliances modeling is reviewed in
order to identify the most important features of small-scale furnace
simulation tools, and to discuss the most common approximations
and assumptions current models are based on. Furthermore, the
most important modeling results are outlined. However, one has to
acknowledge that both the development of precise models, as well
as the accurate performance of experiments, is difficult. With respect
to experiments, it has to be emphasized that due to the mostly dis-
continuous feeding system of small-scale boilers or stoves, a stable
reaction environment can not be obtained. For example, by opening
the heating unit during discontinuous feeding, the air-fuel ratio,
which has to be controlled in well-defined experiments, can vary
significantly [124]. Furthermore, 100% constant feed rates can hardly
be managed, even in automatically fed pellet boilers. Accordingly,
even with respect to the validation of modeling results, it has to be
considered that errors can arise on both the experimental and
modeling side.

PTable 6 outlines that a simulation tool for real-world small-scale
heating appliances has to include certain modeling aspects in order
to accurately model a given reactor configuration. First, a model has
to include a description of the solid bed, which will be thermally
converted to gaseous products and ash. The solid phase conversion
defines the volatiles release rate to the gas phase. The solid bed
model describes the drying of moist wood, together with wood
devolatilization, where most of the combustible gases are released,
as well as char conversion. The char can be converted through gasifi-
cation, oxidation, or a combination of the two. The extent to which
these two reaction paths occur is dependent on the operational con-
ditions of the furnace. As outlined in the previous section on particle
degradation modeling (Section 4), also with respect to the bed model
in domestic combustion units, chemical processes related to the
thermal conversion of wood have to be simplified significantly in
order to be used in an efficient simulation tool for engineering appli-
cations, such as optimization and design of heating appliances. Not
only is the thermal conversion of a single particle a model require-
ment, but also the accurate description of the influence of various
wood particles on each other is needed for a detailed bed model. It
should also be mentioned that another requirement for the accurate
modeling of heating appliances is the ability of the bed model to
account for the wood species of interest. A flexible bed model, which
allows for a detailed characterization of the parent fuel, is mostly
achieved by splitting wood into its pseudo-components.

PAlso presented in Table 6 is the second chief feature of a domestic
heating unit model is the gas phase model, which must contain a

Table 6
Chief features required for model development of small-scale heating appliances.
This table lists the most important features of a model.a implies that the bed model
was decoupled from the gas phase model, as the temperature at the boundaries of
the wood log were set to constant values. b RSM refers to Reynolds-Stress Model,
c refers to the Eddy Dissipation Model (EDM), d refers to the Eddy Break-Up model
(EBU), e refers to the Eddy Dissipation Concept (EDC), f refers to probability density
function modeling approach. The references refer to current state-of-the-art mod-
els, that included certain key aspects of a specific feature. “Theoretical model” implies
that model development was based on theoretical knowledge of the processes and
was purely mathematically modeled. This required that transport equations were
solved. “Empirical model” models have been derived mainly from data obtained
from experiments. “Semi-empirical model” is used to categorize models that are not
based on solving transport equations, but are related to simplified mathematical
expressions that are commonly related to measurements.

Pdetailed descriptions of homogeneous gas phase reactions, see
Section 5, turbulence, turbulent combustion and radiation. Gas
phase kinetics are subject to gross simplifications, since not all
chemical species released from the wood log can be modeled due to
efficiency requirements of the simulation tool. Furthermore, not all
evolution paths of all emissions are yet fully understood.

PA third chief feature in the modeling of a small-scale combustion
unit, also listed in Table 6, is an accurate coupling between the solid
and gas phases, as the two phases significantly interact. Accordingly,
heat and mass transfer from one phase to the other need to be
accounted for in great detail. Blowing effects of leaving volatiles
from the wood particle will reduce the heat and mass transfer of the
gas phase back to the solid phase, see Section 4.1.1, which can affect
conversion times and product yields.

PA fourth main feature listed in Table 6 is an accurate description
of furnace geometry and furnace wall material properties, both of
which have a significant effect on temperature history within a com-
bustion chamber. The material properties of furnace walls, which
are also recommended to include the presence of any glass windows,
significantly affect the temperature in the combustion chamber, as
well as heat transfer into the room surrounding the heating unit.
Moreover, an accurate description of flow fields entering and leaving
a computational domain is required to precisely model emission
products and quantities.

PBased on the above, one can conclude that a number of different
features must be included in a model in order to yield an accurate
real-world simulation tool. In the following sub-sections, this will be
discussed in more detailed for the particular application of boilers or
stoves.

6.1. Boiler

P6.1.1. Bed model

PEmpirical bed models [154] are a well-established concepts for
fixed bed modeling of wood log-fired boilers and wood pellet boilers.
The release of volatiles in these models is based on the main com-
pounds of wood, which are C, H and O. This means that the presence
of S, N and Cl, initially found in the wood material, is commonly
neglected.

PAccordingly, such a simplified bed model cannot account for the
formation of either NOx or ash vapor precursors. There is a number
of works in which these minor constituents of wood are neglected,
e.g. [123,127]. Typical volatile species that are included in the mod-
els are; CH4, CO, CO2, H2 and H2O [154], with the release rate
depending on the local fuel composition and stoichiometric air ratio.
Furthermore, char can react (gasification) with CO2 to form CO, and
with O2 (oxidation) to form CO2 or CO, that reacts with O2 in the gas
phase to form CO2. The main problem with this model, which is also
applied in [14], is that the temperature dependency of the CO/CO2 is

Pneglected. Another weakness of such empirical models is that the
accuracy of the modeling results are totally dependent on the accu-
racy and applicability of the experimental data used to build the
empirical model. One should therefore be very cautious not to use
an empirical model for cases that are different from the experimen-
tal setup for which the model was designed. If used for the right con-
ditions, however, empirical bed models may yield high accuracy
results at an affordable cost.

PIn comparison to the empirical model approach discussed above,
there are other bed models based on a theoretical understanding of
the chemical and physical processes occurring during the thermal
conversion of wood and the mathematical description of those pro-
cesses. Porteiro et al. [124] developed a 1D transient particle model
and applied it to the simulation of a domestic wood pellet boiler.
More information on this model can be found elsewhere [52,53]
(also in Section 4 of this review paper), and is not repeated here. In
the following we will describe how their bed model interacts with
the gas phase above the bed. They modeled pellets [124], and as the
pellets became very small, they leave the bed and get entrained into
the gas phase, where a Lagrangian particle approach is used to track
the particle transport. The Damk€ohler number is defined as the ratio
between the time scales for chemical reactions and convective trans-
port. For a pellet boiler, the Damk€ohler number is large, and hence,
the bed can be approximated as a well-stirred reactor. This means
that all particles can be assumed to be surrounded by the same gas
species concentrations [124]. This is not the case, however, for wood
logs, where the Damk€ohler number is much smaller.

PAnother bed modeling approach is based on the approximation of
constant load operation, which indicates that wood and oxidizer
flow rates and compositions are not allowed to change during the
entire model scenario [123]. It is accentuated that this simulated test
case can hardly be maintained in the entire transient thermal con-
version cycle in a combustion unit due to inevitable fluctuations.
However, if the purpose of the model is to gain fundamental under-
standing of the processes in the combustion chamber, the effect of
this assumption is negligible.

PSplitting the wood log in constant layers in which the three con-
version stages, drying, devolatilization and char conversion occur is
another simplifying assumption [123]. The thickness of the different
layers is set based on the ultimate analysis of wood, the need to
maintain a constant burnout of the wood log and the motivation to
predict a reasonable temperature in the combustion zone, as a large
amount of char is assumed to lead to too high temperatures. Accord-
ingly, it is suggested that the bed model is consequently somewhat
fitted to what has been observed in experiments and what can theo-
retically be expected from the combustion of wood logs in combus-
tion units. Even when splitting the wood log into three layers, the
wood log was not fully resolved for [123] and no mass transfer phe-
nomena of the volatiles within the wood log were modeled. As a
result, the volumetric mass sources entering the CFD simulation are
only kinetically controlled, and thus only the temperature at the
wood log surface defines the mass release rate of volatiles. In this
work,was CO2 also considered to be the only oxidation product,
which is another simplifying assumption of
that solid phase
model [123] that is considered a weakness. Considering that the for-
mation of CO from char would lead to a different heat release rate, a
different temperature profile and gas species concentrations enter-
ing the CFD gas phase model via boundary conditions can be
expected. The deviation between the experimental results and the
modeling results [123] highlights that this consideration of CO for-
mation does not yield accurate predictions of CO levels.

PA common simplifying assumption of the solid phase model of a
wood heating appliances simulation is the decoupling of the bed
model from the results of the gas phase model [123]. This setting
suggests that there is only a forward coupling between the bed
model and the gas phase model. However, this approximation

Pentirely neglects that the temperature in the combustion zone is
fluctuating and accordingly, a varying heat transfer to the wood log
surface is assumed to also affect the thermal conversion of the wood
log and therefore the volatiles release- and char conversion rates.
For this reason, it is considered to be one of the main error sources
in the simulation of wood fired combustion units. It is recommended
to base the coupling on a dynamic interaction between results of the
gas phase model and results of the bed model [124]. In such a case,
the bed model is also influenced by variations of the operational con-
ditions of the combustion unit.

P6.1.2. Gas phase model

PIn this section, the most relevant aspects of the gas phase model
are discussed. This includes the turbulence model, the combustion
model and the radiation model. Gas phase kinetics have already
been discussed in the chapter on homogeneous gas phase modeling,
Section 5.

PTurbulence model

PThe realizable k-(cid:2) model is used in some boiler simulations [154],

but the standard k-(cid:2) model is more common [123,124].

PThe motivation for choosing the standard k-(cid:2) turbulence model is
its robustness, the fact that it is computationally efficient, and that it
still leads to a reasonable accuracy. Near the walls of the furnace,
standard wall functions are applied [123]. Since computational cost
is a primary aspect of the applicability of a simulation tool, the
choice of the standard k-(cid:2) model seems reasonable, but the realiz-
able version is recommended due to better accuracy for more com-
plicated flow patterns.

PCombustion model

PSome researchers [154] coupled turbulence and combustion with
the Eddy Dissipation Model (EDM). Buchmayr et al. [156] claim that
EDM with a two-step methane combustion mechanism is used quite
frequently, despite the disadvantage that the EDM (also valid for the
Eddy Break-Up model, EBU) cannot consider detailed chemistry. On
the other hand, they are very fast, which makes them attractive for
engineering applications. The EDM (and EBU) will result in elevated
reaction rates, since the reaction rates only depend on turbulent
mixing [156].

PThe effect of neglecting detailed chemistry is that the gas temper-
ature tends to be over-predicted. This is due to the fact that for
global chemical reactions there are no radicals in the gas phase,
where the radicals carry chemical energy that could otherwise be
converted to heat. Furthermore, multi-step chemistry such as that
relevant in the evolution path of nitric oxides cannot be accounted
for.

PThe Finite-Rate-Eddy-Dissipation modeling approach, which was
used by Porteiro et al. [124], calculates the Arrhenius expression as
well as the Eddy dissipation rate, and the smaller of the two is cho-
sen to model the reaction rates in the species equations. It is
assumed that this combustion modeling approach can predict what
happens in a combustion chamber in great detail. Close to the bed,
where the flame is located and very high temperatures can be
measured (about 1000 °C), the reaction kinetics are very fast, and
accordingly, the mixing between volatiles and oxygen will control
combustion reactions. Close to the water pipes and the furnace wall,
temperatures will be significantly lower, so the kinetics will be the
controlling factor for combustion reactions. More general informa-
tion on various turbulent combustion models can be found else-
where [157]. One can conclude that the choice of combustion model
depends significantly on the purpose of the simulation tool, with
either being a fast tool or a more accurate one.

PRadiation model

PMost commonly, the discrete ordinate model (DOM) is used for
modeling the radiative heat transfer in boilers [123,124,154]. When
modeling the DOM, the radiative transfer equation is solved for a
limited number of distinct solid angles. One thereby models the
transport of radiative intensity in a sector that is defined by the solid
angle. The value of the intensity is influenced by both the position
vector and the direction vector [123]. DOM is commonly used since
it can be applied over the full range of optical thicknesses [158],
which can also be done by the Discrete Transfer Radiation Model
(DTRM) [159]. The DTRM is based on the assumption that radiation
exiting a surface element within a range of certain solid angles can
be clustered together and modeled as a single ray. Nonetheless, one
needs to take into consideration that both DOM and DTRM are com-
putationally more expensive than other radiation models, such as
the P(cid:1)1 model and the Rosseland model, with the latter being the
most computationally effective [158]. DTRM becomes disproportion-
ately expensive, if there are too many surfaces that rays must be
traced from. This implies that especially for boilers with complex
installations in the interior of the combustion chamber, a denser
grid has to be used and the DTRM is considered too computationally
expensive, as tracing the rays through a large number of control vol-
umes increases the computational effort.

PWhen applying a less expensive radiation model, other restric-
tions become important. The P(cid:1)1 model is restricted to an optical
thickness larger than 1, while the Rosseland model is restricted to an
optical thickness larger than 3 [158]. In the P(cid:1)1 model, the radiative
heat flux vector in a gray medium is approximated [160,161],
whereas in the Rosseland radiation model, intensity is assumed to
be the intensity of a black body at the gas temperature [160]. One
advantage of the Rosseland model is its efficiency, while a main dis-
advantage is that it cannot account for particle effects. For a pellet-
fired furnace, where particles may be entrained in the gas flow dur-
ing the last phases of burnout, or where the nucleation of ash vapors
in the cooler furnace regions can lead to particle formation, the influ-
ence of the radiation exchange between particles and gases may be
significant. This highlights that particularly the P(cid:1)1 model and the
DOM are relevant for wood heating appliance modeling due to their
ability to handle embedded particles. However, even though the
DOM is computationally more expensive, it is able to consider semi-
transparent walls, e.g. glass, which makes it suitable for a furnace
modeling where the radiant heat losses via the glass window have a
significant effect on the temperature within the combustion cham-
ber [158]. The potential of considering the glass window in a radia-
tion model can be a criterion of exclusion for other less expensive
models. Considering all these aspects, it is concluded that the DOM
considers most of the key aspects of a suitable radiation model,
which belongs to one of the chief features of a realistic simulation
tool. This discussion of radiation modeling does not only apply to
domestic boiler modeling, but is also valid for the domestic stove
modeling discussed in the following section. Most commonly, the
properties of the gases (absorption/ emissivity) are modeled by the
Weighted-Sum-Of-Gray-Gases (WSGG) model, e.g. [124]. However,
no simulation tool for domestic boilers included the absorption and
emissivity characteristics of soot, even though the influence of most
of the volatile species products is considered by implementing the
WSGG model. A future field of research is therefore the full and accu-
rate consideration of the role of soot in combustion units, which
therefore also requires the accurate adjustment of the properties of
gas including soot.

P6.1.3. Boundary conditions of boiler

PTo reduce the computational cost of a simulation, it is a common
approximation to not simulate the entire boiler [124]. The water
side of the boiler can be modeled by convective heat transfer, with a
constant heat transfer coefficient. This simplification reduces the

Pcomputational cost significantly and it yields good results. At the
boundaries of the furnace modeling domain, where heat is trans-
ferred to the heat exchanger surfaces, the grid has to be refined in
order to be able to handle the steep temperature gradients [123].
Furnace wall emissivities are normally set to constant values, such
as 0.8 [124] or 0.9 [123]. There is currently no model available that
considers the change of emissivity and heat transfer of the furnace
walls, due to ash vapor condensation and particle deposition. This is
therefore recommended to be investigated further
in future
research.

P6.1.4. Most important modeling results

PScharler et al. [154] found that an optimization of the secondary
air nozzles, in addition to a reduction in the number of installed air
nozzles yield an improved mixing between flue gas and secondary
air, which resulted in a significantly better burnout of CO. Porteiro
et al. [124] were able to detect a strong recirculation zone with their
model. The recirculation zone is essential, since it stabilizes the
flame. In their prediction, the flame occupied two-thirds of the com-
bustion chamber. Another advantage of their model is that a very
good prediction of NOx and an overall good agreement of the CO pre-
diction between the model and measured values [162,163] was
achieved. Furthermore, they found that the operational conditions of
the furnace had negligible effects on NOx formation, and all modeled
cases resulted in a more or less constant NOx yield [124].

PIn other works, the predicted CO deviated significantly from what
had been experimentally measured. As pointed out earlier, the
choice of kinetics of homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions is
assumed to be one main source of error [123] with respect to these
predictions.

POverall, the number of works on small-scale-boiler modeling
(scale of smaller 30 kW), is very limited. Future research is therefore
encouraged to increase the focus on such small-scale boiler units,
since those small units are related to high emission levels.

6.2. Stoves

P6.2.1. Bed model

PEmpirical models are also commonly used for wood log modeling
in domestic wood stoves [14]. Details on the model of Scharler
et al. [14] have been discussed in the boiler section, and the same
model has been used for wood log modeling in stoves where a bed
of two non-touching wood logs was modeled. Touching wood logs
imply that heat and mass transfer from and to the wood log surface
were hindered. However, such a blockade to transport phenomena
has not been modeled in any of the reviewed works.

PWhen modeling small-scale wood stoves fired by wood logs, it is
also a common approach to derive volumetric mass source terms
entering the gas phase model without actually fully discretizing and
solving a bed model [13,132]. The volatiles release of six non-touch-
ing wood logs in the combustion chamber was modeled in these spe-
cific cases. The released gas composition was either based on
Norwegian spruce [13,132] or demolition wood pellets [130]. The
wood consumption rate has to be obtained experimentally for the
model, and accordingly, the wood consumption rate is given under
fixed operational conditions of the furnace, which therefore limits
the applicability of the model to one specific time of a particular test
case. Furthermore, the consumption rate depends on the wood spe-
cies tested. If the wood consumption rates are only known for a lim-
ited number of test cases and wood species, the flexibility of the bed
model is restricted. However, since the main purpose of the work of
Bugge et al. [13,132], was to gain a fundamental understanding of
NOx formation mechanisms from fuel-bound nitrogen, it is assumed
that relevant knowledge can be gained from this model, even though
no detailed bed model has been developed.

PAnother bed model discussed in the available open-literature
restricts the active area to the external surface of the wood log, while
the interior of the wood log was not discretized and modeled [127].
Devolatilization was modeled with a one-step global reaction mech-
anism, which was based on literature data [51,164] linking the com-
position of the gaseous mixture to the wood consumption. Char
gasification was treated in a similar manner. Coupling between the
gas phase model and the bed model was done with mass and heat
source terms at the interface between them.

PIn some works, the solid phase model was assumed to be quasi-
steady-state [126(cid:1)128]. These models are based on the assumption
that only one specific stage of combustion can be described by the
model, where a constant burning rate is given and the stage is
related to a slow shrinkage of the wood log. It is said that the time
scale for wood degradation can be expressed with the time of
shrinkage, which is in the range of minutes. This is very long com-
pared to gas phase reactions, which have time scales in the order of
seconds, so the solid degradation process can hence be assumed to
be steady state [127]. The model can be considered as a computa-
tionally efficient modeling approach, but does entirely neglect sec-
ondary reactions of the leaving tar, as well as the cooling of exiting
water vapor or volatiles. The assumption of immediately leaving gas-
eous products of wood conversion is assumed to be related to signifi-
cant errors as far as emission predictions are concerned.

PTabet et al. [128] modeled a bed composed of a single wood log.
They described the solid bed by three layers that represent drying,
devolatilization and char conversion. The wood log was 50 cm long,
and each layer had a height of 4 cm. This suggests that the sizes of
the layers do not change, suggesting that they maintain the exact
same thickness throughout
this
assumption is limited to a conversion stage where conversion can be
considered to be a quasi-steady-state. Furthermore, this assumption
restricts its application to a specific stage in thermal conversion,
making it unsuitable to model an entire combustion cycle.

the conversion. Accordingly,

PSteady-state assumptions were also performed by Huttunen
et al. [126], though that overall approach for the bed model was
slightly different from previous modeling approaches. Huttunen
et al. [126,155] developed a model for wood log drying, devolatiliza-
tion and char conversion, and coupled it to a CFD model by using
the TULISIJA-code (more background information on the code itself
can be found elsewhere [165,166]). Huttunen et al. [126,155] devel-
oped their solid bed model in two steps, in which the first stage
was only discussing the volatile composition and release rate,
whereas the second stage focused on char conversion modeling.
They made two different models (the first-generation pyrolysis
model and the second-generation pyrolysis model) for devolatiliza-
tion and drying. In the first-generation pyrolysis model, the drying
and devolatilization rates were based on the energy equation
describing heat storage, conduction and convection in the interior
of the wood log, and in addition also energy sources originating
from drying and devolatilization. The equations were based on a
radiative heat flux to the surface of the wood log, which in their
model was defined to be uniform. The disadvantage of this model
is that it is not time-dependent, which is a problem if e.g. ignition
is supposed to be considered. In the second-generation pyrolysis
model, the drying and devolatilization rates were modeled differ-
ently and were said to depend on the penetration velocity of the
temperature zone into the wood log. Limitations of the second-gen-
eration pyrolysis model are that it is only applicable in a certain
range of radiation temperatures and log diameters. The rate of
evaporation and devolatilization is proportional to the penetration
velocity of a certain temperature zone, where the penetration
ffiffi
velocity includes the influences of a constant and 1/
; with t being
t
time [126]. Huttunen et al. [126] coupled the pyrolysis model to the
flow model by inserting its results (mass, energy fluxes, etc.) in the
evolution equations as source terms.

PFor wood log modeling in wood stoves, there are also more com-
prehensive models available in open-literature. These models
include models with fully discretized wood logs that also contain a
detailed description of chemical and physical processes related to
thermal wood conversion [50,51]. These models have been discussed
in detail with respect to single particle models (Section 4). Galgano
et al. [50,51] show that the flow field is closely connected to the tem-
perature and the species distribution released from the wood.

P6.2.2. Turbulence model

PKnaus et al. [125] implemented the standard k-(cid:2) model, the Rey-
nolds stress model (RSM) and the low Reynolds number k-(cid:2) model
suggested by Lam and Bremhost [167]. They tested two cases,
whereof one was an isothermal case (no combustion) and the second
one was the combustion case. In the isothermal case, they investi-
gated the prediction of recirculation zones by the different turbu-
lence models and found that the standard k-(cid:2) model correctly
predicts location and strength of the recirculation zone, whereas the
RSM gives more accurate results. However, these two previously
mentioned models are only applicable at high Reynolds numbers. It
was found that there might also be zones of low Reynolds numbers.
This justifies use of the low Reynolds number k-(cid:2) model. Another
problem is the influence of the walls on the free flow. It was found
that it cannot be adequately modeled with standard wall functions
applied in the k-(cid:2) model and RSM in such narrow geometries. This
underlines the fact that the low Reynolds number k-(cid:2) has some sig-
nificant advantages [125].

PComparing the standard k-(cid:2) model and the RNG-k-(cid:2) model show
that the choice of turbulence models has a significant effect on pre-
dictions of both temperature and emission levels [126]. The RNG k-(cid:2)
model predicts lower turbulent viscosity and a longer turbulent
time scale than the standard k-(cid:2) model.

PFor high Reynolds numbers, the RSM is known to yield more
accurate results than any k-(cid:2) model. This does, however, come at the
cost of more CPU load. In wood stoves, the Reynolds number is typi-
cally rather low, and the extra CPU cost of the RSM model will there-
fore not necessarily pay off. The RNG k-(cid:2) model has not been proven
to perform significantly better than the standard k-(cid:2) model, maybe
with the exception of rotational flows. A better choice is then to use
the realizable k-(cid:2) model, which lately has shown to yield improved
results for a large number of different flows. Unless one really feels
that a low Reynolds number k-(cid:2) model is required, the realizable
model seems to be the preferred option for wood stove simulations.
PBy using the RNG k-(cid:2) model instead of the low Reynolds number
model of Chien it was found that the flame ignite earlier, leading to
higher temperatures in front of the wood log [127].

PDue to its impact on the level of temperature fluctuations, the
choice of turbulence model can have a significant effect on modeling
of NOx emissions. Hill [168] studied the effect of either considering
or neglecting fluctuations of temperature and species and found that
this could yield differences in NOx emissions up to 600%. The rele-
vance of the turbulence model for the accuracy of the predictions of
NOx emissions has so far only been studied for pulverized coal com-
bustion, where entrainment of converting fuel particles is signifi-
cant [168], which means that the turbulence is of significance not
only for homogeneous gas phase reactions, but also for particle-gas
heat transfer and therefore particle conversion. It has not yet been
studied how important the turbulence model is for large wood log
conversion, where turbulence is mainly influencing homogeneous
burnout of combustible gases.

P6.2.3. Combustion model

PKnaus et al. [125] as well as many other researchers [13,50,51,
127,132] coupled turbulence and combustion modeling via EDC.
Very few models [128] used a pre-assumed probability density func-
tion approach. With respect to wood stove applications also the

PEddy Dissipation / Finite Rates Kinetics Combustion Model has been
applied [14]. This approach will yield relatively accurate results with
global chemical kinetics as it accounts for both kinetically and mix-
ing controlled combustion. If detailed chemistry is required, the EDC
model is the more appropriate choice. The increased accuracy does
come at the expense of somewhat higher computations costs. All
wood stove models focusing on NOx are based on the EDC.

P6.2.4. Radiation model

PIn case of wood stove modeling, the Discrete Ordinates Method
(DOM) is commonly applied [13,14,125,127,128,132], as it is also for
boiler modeling. Some researchers [50,51,126] used a discrete trans-
fer model, originally suggested by Lockwood and Shah [169] for
modeling radiation, which is previously discussed but referred to as
DTRM. In work by Huttunen et al. [126], the local absorption coeffi-
cient of the gas phase was calculated based on the Weighted Sum of
Grey Gases (WSGG) approach while the absorption of the soot was
added on top of this. A similar approach has also been used by
others [170,171]. The detailed discussion on advantages and disad-
vantages of various radiation models presented with respect to the
boiler model, Section 6.1.2, can be applied to stove modeling as well,
due to similarities between these two heating appliances.

P6.2.5. Boundary conditions of the wood stove

PThe importance of the consideration of the glass window of
a wood stove as part of the boundary conditions of the stove
on temperature predictions has been outlined in a number of
works [13,132]. However, the influence of a glass window and the
radiative heat loss due to it, are not captured by current models,
since the glass window, like any other furnace wall, is commonly
assigned the same constant temperature as any other furnace
wall [13,127,132]. Some works define stove boundary conditions
based on purely experimentally derived values [126,165,166]. There
is clearly room for significant improvements here. This should be
done by including the transparency of the window and by account-
ing for heat transfer to the surroundings through all furnace walls. In
addition, the air inlets should not be placed at the inlet to the fur-
nace, but rather at the position where the air enters the stove itself.
This means that the air transport channels leading to the furnace
must be meshed and simulated. A reasonable pressure difference
should then be applied between the inlet and the outlet to drive the
draft. In this way, the total airflow to the furnace and distribution
between the different inlets would automatically be correct.

6.3. Detailed comparison of wood stove models

PIn addition to the models discussed in the previous sub-sections,
also more case specific models may be included to yield more accu-
rate wood stove simulations. In the current section, a number of
such case specific models for wood log combustion will be discussed.
Important aspects of a reliable simulation tool for wood stoves are
explained in more detail in Table 7.

PTable 7 outlines which aspects are considered by the currently
available models. The aim is to identify the completeness of current
models in order to understand which aspects of furnace modeling
cannot yet be described. Reviewing the current state-of-the-art has
shown that modeling CO and to some extent also NOx emissions is a
main feature of current models. Even though a deeper understand-
ing of the evolution paths of different gas phase species is recom-
mended in order to optimize gas phase kinetics, the principle
implementation of the gas phase reactions and the corresponding
predictions of emission levels are rather well-established. In con-
trary, many aspects related to the bed model are either entirely
neglected or not accurately accounted for in current models.

PThe first aspect 1) refers to models that include detailed descrip-
tions of chemical and physical processes related to thermal

but was not discussed in the paper at all.

Pconversion of wood and that include evolution equations for wood
mass, char mass, gas species and temperature. It also implies that
the interior of the wood log has been fully discretized. As can be
seen from Table 7, only a limited number of works includes such a
detailed description of the solid fuel. The main reason for this is the
increased computational cost that results from a comprehensive bed
model.

PThe second aspect 2) clearly shows that none of the currently
available models considers the influence of bark. The elemental com-
position of bark, however, differs significantly from the elemental
composition of the wood. This may have a significant effect on con-
version reactions, since the bark contains a higher amount of inor-
ganics that can catalytically influence the conversion reactions.
Especially, when ash formation is a major concern of a model, bark
has to be considered, as it contains a significantly higher ash content
than the inner wood [172].

PModeling stacks of logs (point 3) is a more realistic assumption,
even though it is not assumed to have a significant influence on the
modeling results if the wood logs are not touching. If the stacked
wood logs in the combustion unit touch (point 4 in Table 7), which
has not been modeled so far, there will be a reduction of mass and
heat transfer to and from the blocked wood surfaces. Accordingly,
depending on the position in a wood stack and depending on the
degree of contact between wood logs, different boundary conditions
for the wood log models have to be used. This is expected to influ-
ence conversion times, and product release rates. So far none of the
wood stove models, has taken the complexity of in-contact stacking
of wood logs into consideration. A transient log model (point 5) can
be applied for the entire thermal conversion process, also including
initial heating and ignition of the wood logs, the stage of more or
less stable devolatilization and char conversion rates, as well as the
final stage where only residual char is converted to ash. Some of the
models available in the current literature only focus on one specific
stage in the thermal conversion of the wood log, where constant
thermochemical degradation and combustion can be assumed
[126(cid:1)128]. The aspect of transient log models is furthermore closely
linked to modeling of ignition principle (aspect 9). It was found that
unless a dynamic coupling between gas phase and bed model, con-
sidering the influence of a higher heat flux back to the bed model to
due flame establishment, was done, the ignition principle was not

Pfully accounted for. Furthermore, if the aim is to model a multi-cycle,
ignition modeling is essential. However, as can be seen from Table 7
also none of the current models was extended over more than a
single combustion cycle.

PWhen pseudo-components are modeled (point 8), wood is split
into hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin and therefore enables the
user to adjust the corresponding mass fractions with respect to the
applied wood species. If only wood (the mixture of all main pseudo-
components) is simulated, the aspect is marked as “not considered
((cid:1))” in Table 7. Splitting the wood into its pseudo-components,
which results in a higher flexibility of the model since different
wood species can easily be modeled, is not common for wood log
conversion modeling in wood stoves.

POnly Bugge et al. [13,132] explicitly mentioned the relevance of
glass windows on the energy equations of the stove, since the glass
window can be linked to significant heat losses. Still, even in their
work, the glass was treated as an optically thick isothermal wall.
Expanding the computational domain to also including the stove
walls in an energy balance, such that the heat transfer to the sur-
rounding room can be modeled, has only been done by Scharler
et al. [14,154].

PSoot is only considered in models developed by Bugge et al.
[13,132] as well as Huttunen et al. [126]. Furthermore, the validity of
the soot models and chemical kinetics used in these works, and their
ability to accurately predict the correct level of soot, still has to be
proven.

PThis discussion outlines that with respect to wood stove model-
ing, a significant number of chief aspects required for a realistic sim-
ulation tool, have not yet been considered in current models.

7. Bed models in grate furnace modeling

PThis section focuses on fuel bed modeling in large-scale grate fur-
naces. Yin et al. [173] stated in their review paper that there are two
common approaches to modeling biomass conversion in a large-
scale grate furnace fuel bed. These approaches are listed and briefly
described in Table 8.

PThe main challenges for current bed models are the inhomogene-
ity and complexity of the wood bed, and the fact that this demands
to capture the
detailed multi-dimensional models.

Approach

Short description

Approach 1

The bed model is measurement-based as well as experience-

Approach 2

based. The inlet conditions for the freeboard model are taken
from measurements. The prescribed combustion rate is depen-
dent on the position on the grate and can be obtained from
heat and mass balances of fuel and primary air. Outputs of the
bed model are temperature, species concentration and velocity
profiles, which enter the freeboard a model [173].

Separate models for solid bed and gas phase are developed. In the
most advanced case the bed models deliver the inlet conditions
for the CFD model and radiative heat transfer from the free-
board back to the fuel bed model is also modeled, resulting in a
dynamic coupling between the two models [174]. In a more
simplified approach, the two models can also be decoupled,
and therefore the degree of coupling can vary.

a Freeboard refers to the gas phase above the fuel bed.

Pstructural changes of the bed due to thermal conversion, as well as
phenomena occurring in connection to those changes, such as
channeling, multi-dimensional models are more accurate. But,
multi-dimensional simulations are also associated with higher
computational costs. For efficient large-scale grate furnace simula-
tion tools, simplifications of the fuel bed are therefore required.
These simplifying assumptions are the primary difference between
single particle modeling and fuel-bed modeling in large-scale grate
furnaces.

today’s

PThe main disadvantage of

independent modeling
approaches for the solid bed and freeboard is that in order to
describe flow, turbulence and heat transfer in two separate sub-
models, a number of simplifications are required (e.g. for tempera-
ture and velocity profiles at the interface between the gas phase and
bed model) [174]. The bed shape is also usually geometrically simpli-
fied, e.g. evened out. Due to these simplifications, no overall valid

Pmodel is commonly developed, but rather models that only apply to
certain furnace types. This is due to the fact that a lot of simplifying
assumptions are based on measurements in specific plants with dif-
ferent grates. Furthermore, experiments for validation of the output
from the bed, which enters the gas phase, can hardly be done,
because experiments at the interface between the two phases are
very challenging [174]. Fig. 22 shows the theoretical coupling
between the freeboard and fuel bed that is required for an accurate
CFD simulation of the grate furnace.

PTable 9 outlines the current state-of-the-art of solid bed models
applied in large-scale grate furnace simulations. Only grate furnace
bed models using woody biomass have been included. Biomass types
other than wood have not been considered.

PAsh-related problems are vast, and can range from affecting par-
ticulate emissions, to causing internal plant problems related to
slagging, deposit formation and corrosion. The enhanced ash melting
behavior of a fuel in particular can lead to problems in a grate fur-
nace [172]. Wood has a rather low ash content, while herbaceous
biomass has a high ash content that can affect the furnace operation.
It is expected that it is crucial to account for the ash for accurate
modeling predictions if herbaceous biomass is converted, while it is
less relevant for wood conversion. The modeling of fine particulate
formation and ash deposit formation, with a special focus on grate
furnaces, is not frequently done in current models [154]. Because a
biomass is thermally converted on the grate, ash-forming vapors
are released [154]. As the flue gas containing ash vapors cools, fine
particles can be formed due to nucleation or condensation pro-
cesses. Ash vapors can condense on these particles. However, in
addition to condensation on the particles, ash vapors can also con-
dense on the boiler walls [154]. These ash vapors contain sulfur and
chlorine, which means that condensation on the furnace walls can
lead to corrosion. One can clearly see that depending on operational
conditions, and therefore temperatures in the furnace, as well as
the biomass type, the importance of ash vapor condensation varies
significantly.

increases. The combustion gas exits the solid phase and enters the freeboard, while the radiative heat fluxes emitted by the flame and the furnace walls heat up the biomass on the
grate.

POne of the most detailed bed models available today solves a 3D
CFD code for both the solid and gas phase by only adjusting the
transport equations with respect to the volume fraction occupied by
the solid matrix [174]. This highlights the fact that the bed model
and the gas phase model are closely linked, and that the interaction
between these two phases is dynamic. The model is steady-state and
accounts for freeboard and bed modeling based on a multiphase
approach. The principle of the multi-phase approach is that the
physics and the reactions of both the solid and gas phase are consid-
ered simultaneously. Drying is based on a pure thermal model.
Detailed reactions describing devolatilization and char conversion
are included in the model. A simplifying approximation of the model
is that the detailed gas phase composition is not fully modeled,
instead, volatile species mass fractions are approximated based on
experimentally defined relations. Experimental relations suggested
by Thunman et al. [189] were then used, in addition to the elemental
mass balance in order to calculate the mass fractions of a total of five
different volatile species. The particle mixing model accounts for the
influence of grate movement, which is causing a stronger mixing in
the bed. The corresponding particle mixing coefficient is experimen-
tally obtained [191], and it is affected by the physical properties of
the biomass in the fuel bed, the type of grate installed in the fur-
nace and the operation conditions of the furnace. The simulation
results gave too high temperatures compared to experiments.
This deviation is most likely due to the wall boundary condi-
tions, which are set to be adiabatic. Another reason for over-pre-
dictions of
found to be the inaccurate
prediction of secondary air penetration. The model under-pre-
dicted the penetration depth of the air from the secondary air
nozzles [174].

PThe FLuid dynamic Incinerator Code (FLIC), where transport
equations are solved in 2D [3,190], is less complex than the 3D
model discussed above. Two sub-models, where one accounts for
the fuel bed (FLIC) while the other handles the gas flow in the free-
board above the bed, are the basis of this model. The two sub-models
are dynamically coupled via the boundary conditions, but the fuel
bed is only heated by radiation from the gas phase. Devolatilization
is described with a one-step global model, and the permanent gas
phase is composed of C2H4, CO2 and H2O. As products of char conver-
sion, CO as well as CO2, are formed [3].

PFLIC is based on solving transport equations for both the entire
bed and the freeboard [191]. The equations in the bed are solved in
2D. The solid fuel conversion is split into four sub-processes, namely
drying, devolatilization, combustion of the volatiles in the gaseous
phase and char gasification. The model is steady-state, and it is
assumed that the conversion front moves downward from the top of
the bed at the same constant speed. During drying, the fuel is heated
by radiation, but also the dry primary air flow from below the grate
drives moisture out of the bed. Gas combustion is considered to take
place in the voids of the bed. The burning of the volatiles is depen-
dent on kinetics, as well as the mixing rate with the under-fire air.
One current restriction to the FLIC model is that it is not possible to
solve the velocities of the bed, but instead a horizontal movement of
the bed is predefined. The vertical component of movement is
obtained from the solid-phase continuity equation [191].

PDue to channeling, the temperature profile across the bed is
highly non-uniform. It is assumed that channeling inhibits mixing
between combustible gases and air, and results in a lower combus-
tion efficiency of hydrocarbons, thus increasing the CxHy emissions.
Only a limited amount of work has yet been done concerning

Pmodeling of channeling. Hermansson and Thunman [192] modeled
channeling and the shrinkage of a bed in a grate furnace. However,
they only discussed char conversion in the bed model (excluding
drying and devolatilization), their model was therefore not included
in Table 9. It was found that the shrinking of the bed is not smooth.
The reasons for this are uneven fuel consumption across the bed and
the influence of the moving grate, as well as the non-spherical parti-
cle shape. The particles have a rough surface; therefore, particles
will not smoothly slide down in the bed as the thermal conversion of
the bed proceeds. Hermansson and Thunman [192] recommended
describing shrinkage as a combination of continuous bed shrinkage
and occasional collapses due to porosity growth.

PUsing the FLIC model for simulating a wood chip boiler predicted
that char conversion starts in the middle of the moving grate [3].
High CO contents were found next to the bed, and CO levels were
reduced significantly as mixing with secondary air increased. Experi-
ments showed that volume fractions of CO and NO in the flue gas
experienced significant fluctuations, ranging from 313 to 781 mg/m3
and 27.8 to 65.1 ppmv, respectively. Modeling results were within
these ranges, being 403.5 mg/m3 and 40.6 ppmv, respectively [3].
For validation, one has to keep in mind that near the bed, detailed
measurements cannot be obtained mainly due to unavoidable
unsteady phenomena, mostly due to the riddling of the fuel on the
grate, which is enhanced by grate movement and sudden collapses
of channel-structures in the bed, thus leading to fluctuations in
measurements [174].

PThe influence of flue gas recirculation can also be captured with
this simulation tool, built up by a combination of FLIC and Flu-
ent [190]. The CO reduction when modeling a test case without flue
gas recirculation has been shown to be significant compared to a
test case considering flue gas recirculation. This behavior can also be
replicated by the model [190]. As a rather cold flue gas was recircu-
lated, this flue gas also reduced the flame temperature, resulting in
lower peak flame temperatures and higher gas volumes being trans-
ported through the combustion chamber, resulting in an enhanced
CO formation. However, the advantage of such a recirculation is that
the temperature reduction leads to less NOx formation as the ther-
mal NOx formation route is decelerated. However, the reduction
potential found in experiments and simulation was small, as the
main source of NOx is not the thermal formation route, but rather
fuel-bound nitrogen [190].

PIt is concluded that the 2D-FLIC code in connection with Fluent
for free board handling is able to correctly simulate the combined
phenomena of heat transfer, homogeneous and heterogeneous
kinetics and fluid flue for a moving grate-boiler.

PA 1D bed model solving for governing equations for energy of
solid and gas phase and gas species was developed for a biomass
boiler, where the fuel enters a conical grate from below [188]. The
fuel is then transported outwards, with rings that rotate either clock-
wise or counterclockwise. The fuel bed of biomass in grate furnaces is
highly heterogeneous. Even though detailed evolution equations were
solved [188], devolatilization was simplified compared to what has
been found in single particle modeling. Devolatilization was based on
earlier single particle modeling work by Alves and Figueiredo [34]. In
comparison to their work, only the devolatilization reactions of cellu-
lose and hemicellulose were modeled [188] instead of modeling six
independent parallel reactions as suggested by Alves and Figueir-
edo [34]. In order to compensate for the higher computational cost of
solving a higher number of transport equations, the model was
reduced to 1D. Since transport equations for the bed and the gas
phase are modeled, they dynamically interact [188]. The model was
able to clearly identify the influence of the particle size on the overall
conversion process [188]. Smaller particles ignite faster and absorb
radiative heat more efficiently. However, the simulations also gave
temperature oscillations, which can be explained by an easier cooling
of smaller particles compared to large particles. As reactions in the

Psolid particle are enhanced, heat release starts and the temperature
of the particle rises, which enhances the temperature difference
between the solid phase and the gas phase. Consequently, re-radia-
tion losses of the particle will be enhanced, cooling the particle and
resulting in the observed temperature oscillation [188].

PThe bed modeling of grate furnaces is also done by developing
single particle models and coupling them to a bed model. Most of
these bed models, based on explicit particle models, are based on
thermally thin particles [108,193(cid:1)195], while it is assumed that for
wood chips or pellets forming the bed, the intraparticle temperature
gradient also has to be considered. Models based on the assumption
of thermally thick particles in beds [45,46] were already discussed in
Section 4. The bed models were 1D, assuming that only the gradients
in the direction of the bed height were relevant. This is also the
direction of the primary air flow. Next, the gas phase in the bed was
solved in Cartesian coordinates, whereas the single particles were
described by 1D spherical coordinates [45,46]. Therefore, the bed
model is discretized by the so-called “1D + 1D”-grid [45]. One of
these particle models [45] is based on the assumption of constant
operational conditions, which as a consequence lead to the simplifi-
cation of a pseudo-steady-state. Another simplifying assumption of
the model is that one assumes the bed surface temperature to be
constant over the entire length of the grate. This is considered to be
a gross simplification, since it is well known that the temperature of
the bed drops as the degree of conversion proceeds, and that the
temperature of the ash near the ash outlet is lower. The reason for
this simplification is that the bed model and the gas phase model
were not modeled as dynamically coupled, and therefore indepen-
dent boundary conditions for the bed model are set that do not vary
depending on the gas phase modeling results. This is a gross simplifi-
cation, since the interaction between the two phases influenced by
the operational conditions of the furnace are entirely neglected [45].
PA rather intermediately complex bed model splits the bed into
three zones, in which drying, devolatilization and char conversion,
respectively, are described [187]. The bed model is 1D, leading to
reduced computational costs. The surface layer of the bed in the dry-
ing zone is affected by radiative heat, while the length of the drying
zone is made dependent on the temperature. As long as the temper-
ature is below the ignition temperature, the drying layer is still pres-
ent. As soon as the temperature increases over this critical ignition
temperature, the devolatilization zone is reached. The ignition tem-
perature is user-defined, thereby suggesting that the geometrical
dependencies of different conversion layers and the propagation
speeds of these layers are solely dependent on a fixed temperature
defined by the user of the model [187]. This is clearly a gross simpli-
fication of the model, thus reducing its flexibility to certain wood
species and operation conditions. The ignition velocity influencing
the bed conversion and gas release from the bed has been taken
from literature data found for batch combustion, and is a function of
particle diameter, moisture content (dry basis), ignition tempera-
ture, initial temperature, particle density and specific heat [196].
This is assumed to introduce some error to the model, since a grate
furnace does not have an exact counter-flow of ignition front and
airflow, as in the batch case. It is assumed that by using this litera-
ture data, the ignition velocity will be under-predicted, but then
again the length of the devolatilization zone is made dependent on
the ignition velocity [196], hence influencing the prediction of the
volatiles release rate. An advantage over most other models is that
this model allows for volatile consumption within the bed. This is
assumed to affect the fractions of released gases from the bed model
entering the free board.

PThe models of lowest complexity are empirical models, which
have the primary advantage of being related to low computational
costs, since they do not solve a high number of governing transport
equations. A well-established empirical 1D bed model has been
developed by Scharler et al. [17,177,181,182]. The model is based on

Pexperimental results that showed that linear correlations between
the release rates of H2O, C, H, N and O from the woody fuel can be
found. This leads to the simplification that only a single parameter
(e.g. the release of C) has to be known to mathematically describe
fuel consumption. This parameter is obtained from test runs where
samples are taken at different locations on the grate. Furthermore,
conversion parameters have to be known, which are required to
model the concentration of gas phase species at a certain location.
These conversion parameters are either taken from literature or
based on experience/ assumptions. When modeling NOx formation
in a biomass grate furnace, the empirical bed model is recommended
to be improved by a more fundamental model based on transport
equations [182], even though such a development has to be balanced
with the computational effort.

PIt is not common for empirical models to include a dynamic cou-
pling between the bed and the free board. It is very often only for-
ward coupling that is done [177,181,182]. Such a decoupling of bed
and gas phase models [16,17,175,177,181,182] is clearly a gross sim-
plification, since changes in operating conditions will affect conver-
sion in the fuel bed and therefore also conditions in the freeboard,
which is not accounted for if decoupling is done.

PSome empirical 1D bed models do, however, include a dynamic
coupling between the bed and the gas phase [186]. The dynamic cou-
pling is then done with the radiative heat flux emitted by the flame
and the furnace walls, which heats up the fuel bed, as well as the
mass flux of combustible gases from the fuel bed into the gas phase.
Yet, the fuel conversion, being influenced by these radiative heat
fluxes, as well as the primary air flow and recycled flue gas flow
through the bed, is only described with an empirical 1D bed model.
The output of this model entering the gas phase includes tempera-
ture and velocity profiles of the exiting volatiles, in addition to spe-
cies concentration profiles.

PThe model of lowest complexity is the zero dimensional time-
independent scheme [184] that splits the bed into two zones [197].
This model has not been added to Table 9, since it cannot be catego-
rized by one of the approaches listed in Table 8. The furnace operates
under steady conditions. The two zones are drying and conversion
(devolatilization and char conversion), and in each of these zones
mass and energy balances have to be solved. In the conversion sec-
tion, it is assumed that a mixture of 11 species is present in the gas
phase and the species exiting the fuel bed are in a thermochemical
equilibrium. The empirical bed model, as well as the zero dimen-
sional time-independent scheme, are acceptable engineering tools if
the focus of the studies lies in an analysis of the freeboard processes
and optimization in the freeboard region. These models, however,
might not be suitable for primary air zone optimization [184].

PIt was found that a major part of the bed models in large-scale
grate furnaces is empirical [16,17,175,177,181,182,184,186]. This
finding was confirmed by Yin et al. [173], claiming that such experi-
ence- and measurement- based models are attractive due to their
robustness. Due to their reduced computational time, these models
are still important for engineering applications.

PIn conclusion, it can be stated that detailed thermal degradation
and the combustion of single particles forming the bed are not com-
monly done with respect to grate furnace modeling. This was also
found by Hajek and Jurena [198], who stated that current works
model a homogeneous isotropic packed bed rather than individual
particles of fuel.

8. Conclusion and recommendation

PSingle particle degradation models, simulations of small-scale
heating appliances and bed models of large-scale grate furnaces have
been reviewed in this work. A short introduction to wood chemistry
is given. This is considered to be essential in order to understand the
complexity of the challenges related to devolatilization and the char

Interface-based models are commonly used if

Pconversion modeling of wood. Physical differences of wood logs, pel-
lets and briquettes are subsequently mentioned to outline the diver-
sity of the reacting wood type. Following this introduction, particle
degradation modeling with interface or mesh-based models is dis-
cussed and the main assumptions and simulation results are out-
lined.
reduced
computational cost is essential while mesh-based models are more
detailed and include more physics, such as the gas phase flow and
pressure solutions inside the wood particle. Secondary tar reactions
are also commonly implemented in mesh-based models. For engi-
neering applications, the interface-based models provid accurate pre-
dictions of mass and energy fluxes, which are the main coupling to
gas phase modeling. An emphasis was also placed on discussing the
complexity of the models with respect to dimensionality, outlining
that mainly 1D models have been developed so far.

PDifferent drying models were discussed in this paper, and it was
found that a combination of the equilibrium model and the thermal
drying model is a suitable choice for accurately describing drying in
both low and high-temperature conditions, thus covering a broad
temperature range. Kinetic rate drying models are typically found to
be significantly less CPU intensive though.

PEspecially with respect to the quantitative determination for the
heat of reactions of devolatilization, no common consensus exists.
The same kinetic data for gasification and oxidation reactions are
often used, since limited data can be found in the literature. The
available kinetic data for heterogeneous reactions is therefore not
able to account for the varying char reactivity dependent on the
operational conditions the char has been formed in, and the wood
species the char has been derived from.

PThe second part of the paper focuses on small-scale heating
appliances. The chief features and their main aspects were listed and
it is not surprising that an accurate bed model and its coupling to
the gas phase can have a significant influence on the accuracy of the
gas phase simulations.

PThe third part of the paper focuses on the bed model of large-
scale grate furnaces. It was found that a number of simplifications
are necessary to keep the model numerically efficient. The complex-
ity of the bed model covers a broad span, ranging from purely empir-
ical models, to advanced 3D CFD codes based on multi-phase
approaches.

PA list of the 11 most relevant recommendations for future devel-
opment is presented below. These recommendations will yield more
reliable simulation tools for both single particle degradation and
small- and large-scale furnaces:

P1. When using the thermal drying model, the evaporation tem-
perature is recommended to be modeled as pressure-depen-
dent, since it is expected that the internal wood particle
pressure will significantly exceed atmospheric pressure, such
that the assumption of drying at 373 K can result in false pre-
dictions.

P2. Determine the influence of inorganics on the conversion of the

solid phase.

P3. Determine the volatile species composition for different
wood species and conversion rates. As a consequence it is
also possible to model ash deposit formation more accu-
rately and predict ash-related internal furnace problems,
and influence of ash deposit formation on the thermal effi-
ciency of a furnace.

P4. Define reaction pathways and determine precisely the prod-
ucts and reaction kinetics for gasification and oxidation reac-
tions of char derived from wood devolatilization. In addition it
is recommended to model char conversion as pressure depen-
dent. This will result in a more accurate description of heat
release as well as a more detailed modeling of reaction prod-
ucts that enter the gas phase model.

P5. Development of multi-dimensional single particle models such
that the diversity of wood particles can accurately be repli-
for
cated. Multi-dimensional models would also account
anisotropy of the solid and non-homogeneous boundary con-
ditions of a large particle, such as a wood log.

P6. Development of a comprehensive, but numerically efficient
single particle model that can accurately describe gas phase
movement in the interior of the particle, therefore also
accounting for internal pressure-related structural changes of
the particle. Accurate internal pressure predictions require
detailed knowledge of permeabilities of different wood spe-
cies. Therefore, the database of experimentally defined perme-
abilities needs to be enlarged in the future.

P7. Determination of soot formation reactions related to wood
conversion processes, since significant influences on soot for-
mation are expected, dependent on whether liquid, solid or
gaseous hydrocarbons are reacting.

P8. Develop a detailed model accounting for the NOx formation,
mainly due to fuel-bound nitrogen in large-scale grate furna-
ces as well as boilers and stoves, which balances a detailed
description of the multi-step chemical evolution path and
computational cost.

P9. Development of a more realistic description of the wood log
bed model in a small-scale heating appliance, accounting for
touching of wood logs, bark-containing wood and the transient
character of thermal wood conversion, which also includes ini-
tial heat-up and ignition. This is assumed to lead to a more
accurate description of CO and unburnt hydrocarbon emis-
sions.

P10. Expand the computational domain of small-scale heating
appliances, such that radiative and convective heat transfer
into the surrounding room can be accurately modeled. This is
assumed to be necessary if the purpose of the simulation tool
is the optimization of small-scale heating appliances, since a
stable heat release to the room is a chief feature.

P11. Consideration of the influence of different materials used in
the furnace on radiative heat losses, e.g. glass windows. Only
in this case can the small-scale heating unit be fully optimized.
