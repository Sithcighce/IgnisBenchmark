    "question_text": "Analyze the sensitivity of predicted indirect particle-fluid-particle conduction to the surrounding layer thickness δ and minimum conduction distance s in dynamic multi-particle systems based on the results of Lattanzi and Hrenya [121] shown in Fig. 4. Explain why in dilute systems (φ_s ≤ 0.5) the results strongly depend on δ but are insensitive to s, whereas in dense systems (φ_s > 0.5) the predicted indirect conduction strongly depends on s. What are the physical reasons for this differential sensitivity?",
    "standard_answer": "In dynamic, multi-particle systems, the sensitivity analysis by Lattanzi and Hrenya [121] reveals: For φ_s ≤ 0.5, the percentage change in average indirect conduction %ΔH_pfw shows strong dependence on δ. When δ is altered from 0.2 r_p to 0.1 r_p or 0.3 r_p, the error can exceed 50% (Fig. 4a). This is because in dilute systems, particles are more mobile and have fewer enduring contacts. The surrounding layer method calculates conduction when particles are close but not touching. δ determines the range over which this conduction is considered. In dilute flows, particles frequently approach each other within δ, making the results sensitive to its value.\n\nConversely, in dense systems (φ_s > 0.5), the predicted indirect conduction becomes strongly dependent on s. Physically, s is related to the surface asperities and gas rarefaction effects. However, in dense systems with φ_s > 0.5, the predicted percentage change decreases when a larger δ or smaller s is used. The minimum conduction distance s physically represents the effective gap where continuum conduction breaks down. In static systems, s has a significant impact on total heat transfer (Fig. 3). When s is too large (e.g., s/r_p = 0.1, the predicted results become nonsensible. This is because in dense packings, particles are in persistent contact, and s acts as a cutoff for the integral that would otherwise be singular at contact. In dense systems, the number of particle pairs within separation distance < s increases substantially. Therefore, selecting appropriate δ and s values is critical, yet no rigorous guidelines exist, necessitating further work including delicate experimental measurements or DNS.",

      "1": "Opposite to what has been observed in static systems, the predicted indirect conduction shows strong dependence on the selected value of δ, e.g. over 50% error in predicting %ΔH_pfw when δ is altered from 0.2 r_p to 0.1 r_p or 0.3 r_p over the range of φ_s ∈ [0, 0.6].",
      "2": "Noticeably, the predicted indirect conduction is insensitive to the selected value of s for φ_s ≤ 0.5 and becomes strongly dependent on s only in very dense particulate systems (e.g. packed beds). However, consistent with those in static systems, the predicted percentage change in the average indirect conduction heat transfer decreases when a larger δ or a smaller s is used.",
