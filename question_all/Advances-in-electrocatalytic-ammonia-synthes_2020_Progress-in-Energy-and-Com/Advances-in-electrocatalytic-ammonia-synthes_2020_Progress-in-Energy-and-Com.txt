Ammonia plays a crucial role in food production and industrial manufacturing, and it is predicted as
the ideal energy carrier in the future. Typically, it is artificially synthesized from nitrogen and hydro-
gen through the Haber-Bosch process, which consumes ~5% of the global natural gas supply and emits
~1.5% of the global greenhouse gas. In recent years, electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis from nitrogen
and water under mild conditions utilizing renewable electricity has drawn much attention from the sci-
entific community owing to its potential in producing ammonia through a clean and sustainable route.
Numerous achievements have been made during the past few years; nevertheless, two major challenges
remain. These are the low catalytic activity due to the inertness of nitrogen molecule and the low se-
lectivity attributed to the violent hydrogen evolution side reaction. This review will discuss the funda-
mentals of electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis at the atomic level relying on a thorough understanding
of the mechanism involved in the Haber-Bosch process. The theoretical screening of the electrocatalysts
and the experimental practice of rational electrocatalyst design with different strategies are reviewed.
Importantly, the relations among design strategies, the catalytic activity and selectivity of the catalyst are
evaluated. Additionally, key experimental techniques to conduct an insightful and efficient study of the
subject area are discussed. Finally, current challenges and the strategies for overcoming these challenges
are examined.

1. Introduction

Ammonia  is  a  significant  chemical  product,  that  has  played
an important role in modern society [1] . Owing to the wide use
of  ammonia-based  fertilizers,  global  grain  production  greatly  in-
creased in the past century [2] . Beyond its industrial use in phar-
maceuticals and explosives [3] , ammonia is also a promising clean,
hydrogen-based,  and  non-carbon  fuel  (17.6%  hydrogen  content),
which  could  be  used  to  help  address  the  challenges  of  climate
change [4–7] .

2 and H

Annually, millions of tons of NH

3 were chemically synthesized
from N
2 through the Haber-Bosch process, which was de-
veloped  in  the  early  19th  century  [1] .  Thermodynamically,  this
process is exothermic and spontaneous (R1); however, because of
the  strong  N ≡N  bond  (941.82  kJ  mol −1 )  [8] ,  absence  of  perma-
nent dipole [8] , and large HOMO-LOMO gap (10.8 eV) of the N
2
molecule  [9] ,  high  temperature  (30 0–50 0  °C)  is  needed  to  ac-
celerate the reaction rate, and extremely high pressure (150–300
atm) is required to ensure a forward reaction according to the Le
Chatelier’s  principle.  As  a  result,  it  is  estimated  that  more  than
5% of the natural gas worldwide is consumed to produce H
2  by
steam reforming while maintaining high pressure as required by
the Haber-Bosch process [ 10 , 11 ]. Meanwhile, this process also gen-
2 , which represents about 1.5% of all greenhouse-
erates much CO
gas emissions [ 10 , 11 ].

In comparison, NH

3 can be directly produced from N

2 O
by nitrogenase in some leguminous plants, which is driven by the
adenosine  triphosphate  (ATP)  at  ambient  temperature  and  pres-
sure (R2) [12] . In recent years, researchers attempted to synthesize
ammonia through clean and sustainable routes with the continu-
ous development of renewable energies [13–15] . One strategy to
reduce the fossil energy consumption is renewable hydrogen pro-
duction (such as electrocatalytic and photocatalytic water splitting)
combined with conventional Haber-Bosch reactor [11] , while high
temperature  and  pressure,  as  well  as  large-scale  equipment,  are
still needed. To simplify the core reactor and operating conditions,
Mo- and Al-based redox cycles have been developed [11] ; however,

2 and H

the energy-efficiencies are unsatisfactory ( Table 1 ).  Among  these
new technologies, electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis (EAS) from
N
2 O under mild conditions is predicted to have the high-
est energy-efficiency ( Table 1 ) thus has drawn much attention. In
electrocatalytic systems, water rather than fossil fuel is used as the
hydrogen source, and renewable electricity comes from solar, wind,
and hydraulic energies can be employed to meet the energy re-
quirements of EAS ( Fig. 1 ) (R3). Nevertheless, two challenges face
the EAS approach: i) the effective adsorption and activation of N
2
on the surface of electrocatalyst because of the inertness of the N
2
molecule; ii) the suppression of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)
since  this  side  reaction  is  much  more  kinetically  favorable  than
EAS. Therefore, screening and designing for the electrocatalyst with
both high catalytic activity and high selectivity are of great signif-
icance in this field. Thus far, many important achievements have
been made, more advancements are needed in both NH
3 yield and
Faradaic efficiency (FE) [16–21] .

In this review, the recent progress of the electrocatalytic ammo-
nia synthesis under mild conditions is presented for both the the-
oretical development and experimental practice. First, a thorough
understanding of the fundamentals of EAS is undertaken based on
the mechanism studies of the Haber-Bosch process, and useful in-
sights regarding the nature of nitrogen reduction are provided. Sec-
ond, the computational screening results of electrocatalyst candi-
dates are reviewed using the predicted limiting potentials for EAS
and HER as the criterion. Third, the experimental developments of
the electrocatalyst with different design strategies are presented,
3  yields  and  FEs  are  compared,  and  the  intrin-
where  their  NH
sic mechanisms for enhancing the activity and selectivity are dis-
cussed. Fourth, some key characterization techniques and detection
techniques, which could improve the understanding of the mecha-
nism and improve the reliability and accuracy of product analysis,
are summarized. Finally, in the conclusion section, current and fu-
ture challenges of EAS are discussed, and the directions for further
developments in this field are highlighted.

2. Better understanding for mechanism of electrocatalytic
ammonia synthesis

2.1. Mechanism study and inspiration of Haber–Bosch process

As  a  typical  heterogeneous  catalysis  process,  the  mechanism
for ammonia synthesis catalyzed by the Fe-based catalyst in the
Haber-Bosch  process  has  been  extensively  studied.  As  early  as
1934,  Emmett  and  Brunauer  predicted  the  generation  rate  of
3  should  approximately  equal  to  the  dissociation  rate  of  N
NH
2
molecules on the surface of the Fe-based catalyst [22] . Then in the

1980s, Ertl and co-workers confirmed this viewpoint and revealed
a detailed mechanism [23–25] .

2 and H

As shown in Fig. 2 a, the elementary steps on the Fe-based cat-
alyst can be briefly described as: i) the dissociative adsorption of
2 molecules; ii) the hydrogenations of adsorbed N atoms
N
and N-containing intermediates; iii) the desorption of formed NH
3
molecules. Among these steps, the dissociative adsorption of the
2 molecule (R4) was demonstrated as the rate-determining step
N
(RDS).
N 2 + 2 ∗ = 2 ∗ N
(R4)
where ∗ represents an adsorption site. Using the terms of surface
chemistry, the rate of adsorption can be described as the “stick-
ing coefficient”, which is defined as the ratio of the number of ad-
sorbed molecules to the number of impinging molecules for the
uncovered surface [26] . As for the dissociative adsorption step of
N ) and can
N
be expressed by Eq. (1) [ 26 , 27 ]:

gies of gaseous N
2 molecules in the
2 molecules and the absorbed N
transition state (TS) before dissociating, respectively. S a and E a are
the activation entropy and activation energy barriers for the disso-
2 molecules, respectively. As shown in Fig.
ciation of the adsorbed N

2 a, the E a is fairly low (about ~21 kJ mol −1 on Fe(100)) [ 24 , 28 , 29 ],
and can be further reduced with the promotion of K
2 O [ 30 , 31 ].
However, owing to a large entropy barrier ( S a = ~350 J mol −1 k −1 ),
the sticking coefficient for the N
2 molecule on the surface of the
Fe-based  catalyst  at  the  ambient  temperatures  is  extremely  low
(about 10 −6 to 10 −7 ) [ 23 , 28 , 32 ]. That means only one in a mil-
lion of the gaseous N
2 molecules which contacted with the surface
can  be  effectively  activated  into  N  atoms.  As  a  result,  as  shown
in  Eq.  (1) ,  a  high  synthesis  temperature  is  needed  to  achieve
a  considerable  reaction  rate  for  the  Haber-Bosch  process.  Con-
versely, as for EAS, the effective dissociation of the N
2 molecules
is a significant challenge since the temperature is low (i.e. room
temperature).

2  ( s γ ) and α-N

Fortunately, much higher sticking coefficients were confirmed
for the other adsorption states of nitrogen. Typically, an adsorbed
2 molecule goes through two physical adsorption ( γ - and δ-N
N
2 )
and two chemical adsorption states ( α- and α’- N
2 ) before the fi-
nal dissociation state ( β-N) ( Fig. 2 b) [30] . The sticking coefficients
for γ -N
2  ( s α) are respectively 0.7 and 10 −2  ± 0.5 ,
which are a millionfold larger than that of the β-N ( s
N ), which in-
dicates that the surface coverage of the molecularly adsorbed ni-
trogen is much higher than that of atomically nitrogen under mild
conditions  [ 23 ,  30 ,  32 ].  Therefore,  EAS  could  go  through  an  un-
dissociative  pathway  at  ambient  temperature:  the  N
2  molecules
adsorb  on  the  surface  of  the  electrocatalyst  in  molecular  ad-
sorption  state  ( γ -N
2 ),  and  then  they  are  hydrogenated
gradually  by  the  electrogenerated  active  H  atoms  to  produce
ammonia.

2  and  H

Apart from the synthesis temperature, there are still two signif-
icant differences between the Haber-Bosch process and EAS. The
first one is the makeup of the reaction environment. In the Haber-
Bosch process, the synthesis atmosphere is simple, which consists
2  gases,  while  EAS  is  performed in  a  more
of  purified N
2 O, OH −, and H + ,
complicated environment in which not only N
but also some by-products and impurities exist. The second factor
is the hydrogen source. The H atoms are generated from the dis-
sociation of H
2 molecules in the Haber-Bosch process, while in the
EAS process, they are electrogenerated, and their amount is con-
trolled by the surface electric field and the proton concentration.

2 , H

Based  on  these  previous  studies  on  the  Haber-Bosch  process,

some inspirations for EAS are summarized as below:

i) Under  mild  conditions,  the  α-N

2  should  be  more  favorable
for  the  subsequent  hydrogenation  although  the  sticking  coef-
ficient for the γ -N
2  has a
much stronger interaction with the surface of the catalyst ow-
ing to the electron filling of the anti-bonding orbital of the N
2
molecules, leading to a weakening of the N ≡N bond [ 28 , 32–
34 ].

2  is higher. This is because the α-N

ii) Some of the coexisting species in the electrolyte solution, in-
cluding OH −, H + , H
2 ), and the
unexpected impurities might have much higher sticking coef-
2 molecules [35] , whereby could poison the
ficients than the N
2 . Therefore, although some
active sites for the adsorption of N

2 O, some by-products (such as O

N for the dissociation of N
early transition metals have high s
2
(for example, s
N is about 0.3 on the surface of W [36] ), a disso-
ciative pathway is still infeasible on the surfaces of these metals
because of the poisoning effect mentioned above.

iii) It is well known the hydrogenation steps have much higher E a
and potential energy requirements ( (cid:2)E ) than those of N
2 dis-
sociation in the Haber-Bosch process, although they are not the
RDS ( Fig. 2 a and c) [25] . This is because E a and (cid:2)E of the hy-
drogenation steps can be easily overcome at high temperatures.
However, under electrocatalytic conditions, the first or subse-
quent hydrogenation steps turn to the RDS since the tempera-
ture is low.

iv) Since N

2 gas is barely dissolved in water, the concentration of
N
2 in the aqueous electrolyte solution is very low in magnitude.
Besides, the HER process (a two-electron-proton transfer pro-
cess) is kinetically much favorable compared with the EAS pro-
cess (a six-electron-proton transfer process). As a result, HER
should be the main competing reaction to EAS, especially on
the surface of pure transition metal.

v) As shown in Eq. (1) , the NH

3 generation rate heavily depends
on the activity and the poison resistance of the catalytic sites.
Meanwhile, it is necessary to suppress HER on the cathode to
achieve high Faradaic efficiency. Therefore, the theoretical cal-
culations for the screening of promising candidates as well as
the strategy for catalyst design are of great significance.

2.2. Pathway of electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis

As mentioned above, the N

2 molecule can be reduced through
two types of pathways to synthesize ammonia – the dissociative
and the associative pathways. In the dissociative pathway (like the
Haber-Bosch process), the adsorbed N
2  molecules dissociate into
the adsorbed N atoms ( ∗N) before the addition of H atoms ( Fig.
3 a) [37] .  However,  owing to  little  probability for direct  breaking
of the N ≡N triple bonds and poisoning effect of the active sites,
rarely does the EAS process under mild conditions go through this
pathway. Only EAS processed in molten hydroxide and molten salt
under quasi-mild conditions (200 to 300 °C, 1atm) may undergo
the dissociative pathway [38–44] .

anisms  – the  Tafel-type  and  the  Heyrovsky-type  hydrogenations
[47] . The former is an indirect reaction mechanism in which the
H + ion is first adsorbed on the surface and then accepts the one
electron to form adsorbed H atom ( ∗H), followed by the reaction
with the adsorbed N-containing species ( ∗N
2 H y ,
1 ≤ x ≤ 2, 1 ≤ y ≤ 4). For the Heyrovsky-type mechanism, the ad-
sorbed species, ∗N
2 H y , are directly hydrogenated
by the H + from the electrolyte and electrons from the cathode si-
multaneously.  Under  mild  conditions,  the  Heyrovsky-type  hydro-
genation will be more favorable because of the high E a for Tafel-
type hydrogenation [48–50] . Some cathodic and anodic reactions
in the EAS process under different conditions are summarized be-
low.

2 , ∗N, ∗NH x , or ∗N

2 , ∗N, ∗NH x , or ∗N

Clearly, EAS under mild conditions more likely goes through the
associative pathway ( Fig. 3 b-d), in which the molecularly adsorbed
2 ( ∗N
2 ) is the intermediate before hydrogenation. A perpendicular
N
adsorbed N
2 molecule might go through two different hydrogena-
tion pathways – the associative alternating pathway and the asso-
ciative distal pathway ( Fig. 3 b and c). In the associative alternating
pathway, H atoms add alternately to both the two N atoms of ∗N
2 ,
and two NH
3 molecules are released in the last two steps ( Fig. 3 b).
However,  only  the  distal  N  atom  is  attacked  by  H  atoms  before
one NH
3  molecule is generated in the associative distal pathway
( Fig. 3 c). Another alternating pathway is the associative enzymatic
pathway in which the adsorption configuration of ∗N
2 is “side-on”
mode ( Fig. 3 d). For the distal pathway, N –N bonds break after the
third hydrogenation step. For the two alternating pathways, N –N
bonds break after the fifth hydrogenation step, in which the by-
product, N

4 , may also be generated.

However, during the actual electrolysis, the situation is much
more complicated since all three pathways may be involved. This
is because the adsorption configurations of the intermediates may
change during the process [ 45 , 46 ]. Recently, Wang and co-workers
theoretically  investigated  the  B  single  atom  decorated  graphitic-
carbon  nitride  (B/g-C
4 )  for  photocatalytic  ammonia  synthesis
[45] . They found that the free energy requirement of the conven-
tional associative enzymatic pathway (0.20 eV) is much lower than
that of the conventional associative distal pathway (0.87 eV) [45] .
However, by calculating the minimum free energy diagram with
the  “end-on” initial  configuration,  a  high  active  mixed  pathway
with an energy injection of 0.22 eV was demonstrated [45] . In this
mixed pathway, the first three hydrogenation steps are through the
alternating  mechanism  while  the  last  three  hydrogenation  steps
are through the enzymatic mechanism [45] .

Further, since the H atoms come from the electroreduction of
H +  on the cathode, there are two types of hydrogenation mech-

3. Advances in theoretical calculation of electrocatalytic
ammonia synthesis

In the 20 0 0s, Nørskov and co-workers using density functional
theory (DFT) calculations built a volcano plot, in which the cat-
2 reduction can be described with a single pa-
alytic activity of N
rameter  – the  adsorption  energy  of  N  atom  ( E
N ),  resulting  from
the combination of the Bronsted-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) relation and
the  scaling  relation.  This  method  provides  a  feasible  way  to  ex-
plore the promising catalysts for the EAS approach. Recently, many
theoretical calculations on different kinds of heterogeneous cata-
lysts, including pure transition metal (pure TM), transition metal
oxides (TM oxides), transition metal nitrides (TM nitrides), transi-
tion metal-based single atom catalysts (TM-based SACs), and non-
metal  catalysts,  have  been  reported.  These  reports  facilitate  the
screening of candidates for the EAS catalyst, as well as deepen the
understanding of the underlying mechanism and structure-activity
correlations.

the ∗NH x , the scaling relations have been demonstrated to exist on
the surface of pure TMs ( Fig. 4 b), TM oxides, and TM nitrides [56–
58] . Further, for the associative pathway, the scaling relation is also
a universal rule for the adsorption energy of ∗N
2 H y intermediates
[ 47 , 59 , 60 ].

Subsequently, the DFT calculations were employed to estimate
the free energy change ( (cid:2)G ) of each elementary step to study the
thermodynamics of EAS. The effect of external bias (or the cathodic
potential) is included by using the computational standard hydro-
gen electrode (CSHE). Consequently, similar to that in the Haber-
Bosch process [36] , a free energy diagram and a volcano plot can
be created to show which catalyst could provide the lowest limit-
ing potential for EAS ( U
l(EAS) ). A typical volcano plot describing the
electrocatalytic performance of pure TM in dissociative and asso-
ciative pathways is shown in Fig. 5 a [47] . It is clear the theoretical

3.1. The BEP relation, the scaling relation, and the volcano plot

3.2. Theoretical calculations of pure transition metal and transition
metal oxides

As a six-step proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) process, it
is difficult to quantitatively model the catalyst surface for EAS be-
cause of many possible intermediates and transition states of dif-
ferent pathways. Fortunately, two linear relations, the BEP relation
and the scaling relation can be used to simplify the theoretical cal-
culations.

The BEP relation is an empirical linear relationship between the
activation energy ( E a ) and the reaction energy ( (cid:2)E ) for an elemen-
tary reaction in the field of heterogeneous catalysis [26] . For the
RDS of the ammonia synthesis process, there is an essentially lin-
ear relationship between E a and E
N ( Fig. 4 a) [53–55] . By employ-
ing this relation, the kinetic barrier can be described by the bind-
ing energy of N adatoms (or E
N ). The scaling relation is describ-
ing the  approximate correlations  between the  adsorption energy
of H-containing intermediates ( ∗AH x , A = C, N, O, or S, x = 0, 1,
or 2, or 3) in each elementary step of heterogeneous catalysis. For

A large amount of literature on the interactions between the
pure  TMs  and  N
2  and  the  simplicity  in  modeling  facilitated  the
DFT calculations to investigate pure TMs as electrocatalyst for EAS.
As shown in Fig. 5 a, the theoretical catalytic activity for EAS on
stepped surfaces is lower than that on flat surfaces through the as-
sociative pathway, and the pure TMs on the top of volcano plot, in-
l(EAS) from −0.7 V to −0.5 V (vs.
cluding Ru, Mo, and Fe with the U
RHE, the same below) should be the best candidates [47] . However,
these pure TMs can be poisoned by ∗H during electrolysis [47] . The
12 nanocluster with highly under-coordinated active sites has a
Mo
l(EAS) of −0.5 V thus exhibits high activity ( Fig. 5 b) [60] . Although
U
a small potential gap between HER and EAS was obtained on Mo
12
nanocluster, the selectivity toward EAS is still low [60] . By intro-
ducing a kinetically facile intermediate, a new type of dissociative
l(EAS) of −0.71 V is demonstrated on the surface
pathway with a U

the two available active sites on this surface [63] . Obviously, poor
selectivity towards EAS is the main challenge on pure TMs and TM
oxides.

3.3. Theoretical calculations of transition metal nitrides

In 2001, inspired by the volcano plot for the Haber-Bosch pro-
3 N  catalyst,
cess  [36] ,  Jacobsen  et  al.  [64]  prepared  the  Co
which demonstrated the highest catalytic activity in the thermo-

3 Mo

chemical method for ammonia synthesis. Apart from the synergis-
tic effect from the two TM elements with high and low E
N which
could tune the interaction with intermediates, the Mars-van Krev-
elen  (MvK)  mechanism  based  on  the  surface  nitrogen  vacancies
(NVs) was also considered to play an important role [65–67] . In
EAS, the MvK mechanism is also valid, that is one or two surface
N atom(s) of the TM nitrides can be electro-reduced to NH
3  and
generate NV(s), then the N
2 molecule from electrolyte can be ad-
sorbed and activated by the NV(s) to complete the catalysis cycle.
Skúlason and co-workers reported a series of DFT calculations
on  the  TM  mononitrides  for  EAS  based  on  the  MvK  mechanism
[68–72] . In these systems, not only the (cid:2)G of each elementary step
is  calculated,  but  also  the  stability  against  poisoning  (from  O 2 −,
H + ,  or  OH −)  and  decomposition,  and  the  regeneration  of  active
sites are taken into consideration to evaluate the feasibility of TM
mononitrides catalysts [68] . For example, one of the most promis-
ing candidates, RuN [69] , has to be ruled out due to the poisoning
of H + , though it has the lowest U
l(EAS) ( Fig. 6 c). Finally, only some
of the early TM mononitrides, including VN, CrN, ZrN, NbN, and
WN, are demonstrated to have both high activity, selectivity, and

8

stability [68–71] . Besides, the conventional dissociative and asso-
ciative mechanisms on the surfaces of TM mononitride are unfa-
vorable because the E a and (cid:2)G are high [ 70 , 72 ].

13 N x nanocluster with a U

Other types of TM nitrides were also investigated by using the
DFT  calculation.  Howalt  et  al.  [73]  reported  a  Mo-based  nitrides

to −0.5 V. On the surface of this catalyst,  ∗N
2  is more favorable
than ∗H even at −0.8 V, implying the high selectivity towards EAS
[73] . TM dinitrides and tetranitrides are also predicted to be the
possible  catalysts  [ 74 ,  75 ].  However,  different  from  TM  mononi-
trides, the conventional associative pathways are demonstrated to
be appropriate on the surface of theses nitrides.

3.4. Theoretical calculations of transition metal-based single-atom
catalysts

Compared  to  the  conventional  TM-based  bulk  catalysts,  TM-
based  SACs  with  higher  catalytic  activity,  higher  selectivity,  and
better durability have been used to enhance the performance in
many  electrocatalytic  processes,  such  as  HER,  the  oxygen  evolu-
tion reactions (OER), the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and the
2 RR) [ 21 , 76 ]. Recently, nu-
carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO
merous  theoretical  calculations  involving  TM-based  SACs  in  EAS
on various supports, including graphene-based materials [77–83] ,
carbon nitrides [84–88] , boron-based (B-based) materials [ 89 , 90 ],
phosphorus-based  materials  [91–93] ,  MoS
2  nanosheets  [ 94 ,  95 ],
and Mxene [ 96 , 97 ], have been reported.

Among the TM-based SACs, Mo-based SACs are the most attrac-
tive candidate due to the predicted high activity of Mo bulk cata-
lysts [ 47 , 60 ]. In 2017, Zhao et al. [89] first reported the Mo single-
atoms (SAs) supported by the boron nitride (BN) nanosheets (Mo-
BN) with B vacancies (BVs) exhibits high catalytic activity through
an associative enzymatic pathway. With the side-on configuration,
the N ≡N bond is lengthened to 1.20   ̊A, and the free energy require-
ment for RDS ( (cid:2)G
R(EAS) ) can be overcome by an applied potential
as low as −0.35 V [89] . Further, the BN nanosheets can serve as an
electron reservoir during the process to enhance the catalytic per-
formance [89] . To accelerate the electron transport, a hybrid sheet
consist  of  graphene  and  boron-nitride  (BCN)  is  used  as  a  stable
and conductive support for the Mo SAs (Mo@BCN), and a U
l(EAS)
of −0.58 V is required [79] . In this catalyst, the high concentra-
tion of C atoms could increase the E
N2, thus play an important role
in boosting EAS and suppressing HER [79] . Li et al. [91] compu-
tationally  investigated  17  kinds  of  Mo-based  SACs  with  different
ligands (P, B, N, S, and C), and found the specific ligands can sig-
nificantly promote both the activity and selectivity by stabilizing
the Mo electrons or shifting the d -band center. Among the candi-
l(EAS)  of −0.60 V and a limiting potential
2 C with a U
dates, Mo-B
l(HER) ) of −0.76 V is recommended as the most promis-
for HER ( U
ing catalyst [91] . Most recently, Ou et al. [92] evaluated a series
of Mo-based SACs on N-doped black phosphorus (BP) for EAS and

demonstrated Mo atoms with all the ligands (N x P

Apart from the TMs on the top of the volcano plot, some early

TMs  with  large  E

Recently, some guidelines and strategies were provided for the
screening  of  the  TM-based  SACs  as  electrocatalysts  for  EAS  [ 82 ,
84 ]. Qiao and co-workers focused on the supports (ligands) since
they can regulate the scaling relations by shifting the d -band cen-
ter  of the active sites (i.e.  TM SAs)  [84] . They  suggested finding
the most promising ligand family of SACs and improve the activ-
ity  of  the  best  candidate  with  this  ligand  ( Fig.  7 b)  [84] .  Ling  et
al. [82] gave more specific criteria for TM-based SACs screening:
N2 should be more negative than −0.5 eV to ensure the N
i) the E

is effectively activated; ii) the free energy requirement of the first
and last hydrogenation steps ( (cid:2)G

tively) should be less than 0.55 eV to decrease the U
l(EAS) ; iii) the
3  releasing ( (cid:2)G
free energy for NH
NH3-des ) should be low enough
( < 0.7 eV) to increase the turnover frequency (TOF). Further, other
requirements, including the capacity to suppress HER and against
poisoning, and chemical stability should also be taken into con-
sideration. Yang et al. [98] systematically investigated a series of
TM SAs (including Ag, Au, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pd, Pt, Rh,
2 ) by using
Ru, Sc, Ti, V, W, and Zn) anchored on MoS
the first-principles high-throughput calculations. The binding en-
ergies of TM SAs on the MoS
2  slab were first calculated to con-
firm the most stable adsorption sites and configuration of the TM
3  on
SAs. Then the adsorption energies of N
2 , the hy-
each TM-SAs were calculated since the adsorption of N
drogenations of N
3  always cor-
respond to high energy requirements. By employing this strategy,
the inactive TM SAs for EAS can be efficiently screened without
calculating the whole pathways thus significantly reduce the com-
putational requirements.

The comparison of the theoretical U

ity to suppress HER of the reported TM-based SACs are presented
in Fig. 8 . It is clear the SACs with the center TM SAs in the IVB-
VIB groups (or left branch of volcano plots in Fig. 5 ) have better
catalytic activity, and Mo, W, V, and Nb-based SACs should be the
best candidates for experimental confirmations.

3.5. Theoretical calculations of non-metal catalyst

For  TM-based  catalysts,  the  adsorption  and  activation  of  N
2
molecules strongly rely on the TM atoms, which always have high
selectivity towards HER and strong interaction with ∗H, resulting
in HER domination and poisoning of active sites. Non-metal-based
catalysts are the ideal candidates to solve these problems due to
the metal-free characteristic.

In 2019, Liu et al. [99] investigated 21 B-based catalysts sup-
ported by 8 two-dimensional (2D) materials for EAS. Similar to the
TM-based catalysts, a volcano plot between the (cid:2)G
R(EAS)  and E
N
is established for the B-based catalysts ( Fig. 9 a). Seven catalysts,
including B atom adsorbed on graphene, on boron nitride, on h-

to have both the high activity and selectivity towards EAS [99] . Un-

ing  boron  phosphide  (BP)  and  boron  arsenide  (BAs),  were  con-
sidered  as  high-performance  metal-free  EAS  catalysts  [100] .  On
the B-terminated (111) polar surfaces of BP and BAs catalysts, ex-

tremely low U

high U
dicating both high catalytic activity and selectivity [100] . Further,
these catalysts have a high capacity against poisoning from H
2 O
and show good structural stability under ambient conditions [100] .

4. Advances in electrocatalyst design for electrocatalytic
ammonia synthesis

In parallel to the theoretical calculations, experimental develop-
ments of the catalysts have played an important role in advancing
the EAS process. Great efforts and thus significant progress have
been made in recent years. Inspired by the industrial Haber-Bosch
process and biological nitrogen fixation process, TM and its com-
pounds are believed to have the ability to efficiently adsorb and
2 molecules. A series of TM-based materials, includ-
activate the N
ing pure TMs, TM oxides, TM sulfides, TM carbides, and TM nitrides
has been employed as the electrocatalysts to realize EAS. Recently,
TM-based  SACs  and  non-metal  catalysts  also  shown  high  poten-
tial to gain higher activity and selectivity. In this section, we will
elaborate on the catalytic performance of these electrocatalysts and
also focus on the intrinsic mechanism as well as the strategies for
boosting the activity and selectivity.

4.1. Pure transition metal-based catalysts

As early as the 1980s, pure TMs have been used as electrocata-
lysts to realize EAS [ 101 , 102 ]. However, in these early studies, the
catalytic performance, especially that involving FE, was extremely
low attributed to violent HER on these bulk-catalysts [ 101 , 102 ].
Lately, nanosized pure TM electrocatalysts, including Co [103] , Ru
[104–107] , Pd [ 105 , 106 , 108 , 109 ], Ag [ 110 , 111 ], Pt [108] , and Au
[ 110 , 112–119 ], with abundant active sites and well-designed nano-
structures  by  using  different  engineering  strategies  have  shown
good activity and selectivity for EAS.

MacFarlane  and  co-workers  synthesized  Ru  nanoparticles  (Ru

method  and  investigated  its  EAS  catalytic  performance  [107] .

lyst with an FE of 0.28% [120] . The adsorption of N

strated  on  the  edge  sites  of  hcp  Ru  (001)  NPs  by  DFT  calcula-
tions  [107] .  Recently,  Wang  et  al.  [116]  prepared  flower-like  Au
microstructures  (Au  flower)  by  a  super-rapid  reduction  method,
and they used it as an electrocatalyst to catalyze N
2 reduction. A
NH3 of 1.67 × 10 −10 mol s −1 cm −2 with an FE of 6.05% was
high R
achieved at −0.2 V in 0.1 M HCl, benefiting from the highly den-
dritic structures which can provide abundant exposed active sites
[116] .

The strategy of tuning the exposed facets is feasible to improve
catalytic activity. In 2017, Zhang and co-workers used tetrahexahe-
dral gold nanorods (THH Au NRs) which exposed 24 {730} facets
consist of high-index (210) and (310) sub-facets as the catalyst and
NH3  of  2.69  × 10 −11  mol  s −1  cm −2  and  an  FE  of
achieved  an  R
~4% at −0.2 V in 0.1 M KOH [119] . DFT calculations suggested the
(cid:2)G
R(EAS)  on Au (310) is much lower than that on Au (210) [119] ,
thus disclosing the relation between high activity and low coordi-
nation sites, which is asserted in a previous study [60] . Zhang et al.
[113] revealed that the catalytic activity is linearly increased with
decreasing generalized coordination number (GCN) on the Au sur-
face ( Fig. 10 a and b). In their report, the R
NH3 of nanoporous gold
(NPG) ( Fig. 10 c-e) with a high proportion of low-coordinated sur-
face atoms (CN ≤ 8) is 5.8 times larger than that of the octahedral
Au [113] .

Another  strategy  for  improving  selectivity  is  constructing
TM/2D  materials  nanohybrids  with  engineered  surface  vacancies
and  tuned  electronic  structures.  MacFarlane  and  co-workers  re-
ported a highly selective Ru-decorated “semiconducting” 2H-MoS

(Ru/2H-MoS
phase and 2H-MoS

arating these two competitive process ( Fig. 11 a and b) [104] . More-
over, a high HER overpotential of 187 mV was demonstrated on

[104] . Further, DFT calculations disclosed the N ≡N bonds break just

Alloying is a convenient method to introduce heteroatom thus
directly  regulate  the  electronic  property  of  the  active  center  in
pure TM catalyst. Using this approach, improvements in the cat-
alytic activity were achieved, they are 1.30 × 10 −10 mol s −1 cm −2 ,

lic PdRu porous nanostructures (PdRu BPNs) [105] , and bimetallic
PdRu nanorod assemblies (PdRu NRAs) [106] , respectively. Never-
theless, the FEs are less than 3%, indicating the poor selectivity of
these catalysts. However, Nazemi et al. [114] synthesized bimetal-
lic  hollow  Au-Ag  nanocages  (AuAg  BHNCs)  as  a  catalyst  for  EAS
( Fig. 12 ) and achieved a very high FE of 35.9%. Further, a high FE
of 30.2% was also obtained on the monometallic Au HNCs [114] ,
demonstrating the high selectivity is mainly owing to the confine-
ment of the reactants in the cage (cage effect) which increased the
steady-state concentration of N
2 molecule in the RDS [110] , rather
than the alloying effect.

The comparison of the catalytic performances of the reported
pure TM-based catalysts for EAS with different strategies is shown
in Fig. 13 ( R

in the units of mol s −1 mg −1 ). The ideal electrocatalyst with both
high  activity  and  selectivity  should  be  in  the  upper  right  cor-
ner, thus the best strategy so far is constructing TM/2D materials

nanohybrid. Furthermore, only TM elements in the VIII-IB groups
(or right branch of volcano plots in Fig. 5 ), most of which are noble
metal, were reported to achieve considerable R
NH3 and FE, which
should be mainly attributed to the high chemical stability of these
pure TMs thus resisting the poisoning of coexisting species in elec-
trolysis system.

(V 4 + ),  and  OVs  introduced  by  amorphization,  the  significance  of
hybridization and the important role the amorphous played in EAS
was demonstrated by performing a series of control experiments
[129] .

Constructing  TM  nanohybrid  could  also  alter  the  electronic
structure  of  the  catalyst,  thereby  promote  the  catalytic  perfor-
mance, especially the selectivity towards EAS. Yuan et al. [46] pre-
pared N, P co-doped carbon nanosheets supported Ni
2 P nanoparti-
cles (Ni
2 P/N,P-C) by self-assembly and self-template method and
investigated  its  EAS  catalytic  performance.  DFT  calculations  re-
2 P  species  (0.70  e −)  and  N,P-C  substrate
vealed  that  both  the  Ni
(5.41  e −)  could  transfer  charge  to  the  interface,  resulting  in  not
only more positive charge on the Ni site but also on the N,P-C sub-
strate thus significantly inhibit the adsorption of H + on this cata-
lyst [46] . Apart from the positively charged Ni site which is bene-
ficial for the adsorption and activation of N
2 , the N,P-C substrate is
regarded as an electronic storage medium that could donate or ac-
cept electrons to (from) the ∗N x H y species during the EAS process
[46] . Owing to the specific support effect, the Ni
2 P/N,P-C achieved
NH3 of 9.35 × 10 −10 mol s −1 mg −1
a high FE of 22.89% with a high R

sons for high FE can be observed on the Ru/2H-MoS

4.3. Transition metal-nitrides-based catalyst

Distinct from the pure TMs and other TM compounds on which
the  EAS  processes  are  realized  via  associative  (alternating,  dis-
tal, and enzymatic) pathways, TM nitrides were suggested as the
promising  candidates  via  an  MvK  mechanism  under  mild  condi-
tions by many theoretical calculations as mentioned above [ 68–72 ,

several groups.

tions supported that the VN

however, the oxynitride can be converted to VN during the EAS
process due to the strong bonding between OVs and N ( Fig. 19 b),
resulting in the deactivation of catalytic performance (steady-state

4.4. Transition metal single-atom catalysts

TM-based SACs are considered to be the most promising candi-
date for EAS and thus receiving much attention from the scientific
community. This is because of their excellent catalytic activity (low
l(EAS) ), high selectivity (low adsorption energy of H ( E
U
H ) and high
U
l(HER) ), and superior stability under mild conditions as predicted
by numerous theoretical simulations, and the outstanding catalytic
performances realized in the fields of HER, OER, ORR, and CO
2 RR
confirmed by many experiments [ 21 , 164–167 ].

As mentioned in Section 3.4 , Mo-based SACs are the most at-
tractive  electrocatalysts  with  both  high  NH
3  yield  and  FE  owing
to  their  ultrahigh  activity  and  selectivity,  as  suggested  by  theo-
retical  calculations  ( Fig.  8 ).  Atomically  dispersed  Mo  atoms  have
been anchored to N doped porous carbon (SA-Mo/NPC) ( Fig. 20 a-
NH3 of 5.56 ±0.59 × 10 −10 mol s −1 mg −1
c) and achieved a high R
(2.22 ±0.24 × 10 −10 mol s −1 cm −2 ) with a high FE of 14.6 ± 1.6%
at −0.3 V in 0.1 M KOH [168] . Both the Mo-N sites and Mo-C sites
were observed on the SA-Mo/NPC ( Fig. 20 d); albeit, the Mo-C sites
were demonstrated to have very poor performance, indicating Mo-
N are the active sites for EAS, which is consistent with the previ-
ous DFT calculations [ 89 , 168 ]. The high valence state of Mo in SA-
Mo/NPC (Mo 4 + and Mo 6 + ) suggests that the catalytic site is pos-

itively charged, which is beneficial for the adsorption and activa-
2 [168] . Further, although it is not the optimal potential,
tion of N
the onset potential of SA-Mo/NPC is around −0.15 V, which is very
2 sites and −0.18 V
close to the theoretical U
for Mo-N

l(EAS) ( −0.17 V for Mo-N
3 sites) suggested by theoretical simulations [ 86 , 92 ].
Fe- and Ru-based SACs were also reported [169–172] . Lv et al.
[170]  developed  isolated  single  Fe  atomic  sites  anchored  to  N-
doped carbon frameworks (ISAS-Fe/NC) as an effective EAS elec-
trocatalyst ( Fig. 21 a), in which the active site was demonstrated
to be the Fe atom coordinated by four N atoms (Fe-N
4 ), as shown
by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements
( Fig.  21 b).  By  exploring  the  projected  densities  of  states  (PDOS)
( Fig. 21 c) and charge density differences, it is clear the electrons
were transferred from  3d  orbit  of  Fe  to  2p  orbit  of  N  when N
2
molecule was adsorbed on the Fe-N
4 sites [170] . Finally, the ISAS-
NH3 of 1.03 ±0.04 × 10 −9 mol s −1
Fe/NC catalyst achieved a high R
mg −1  with  a  high  FE  of  18.6  ± 0.8%  at  −0.4  V  [170] .  Geng  et
al. [169] synthesized Ru SAs distributed on nitrogen-doped carbon
(Ru SAs/N –C) and reached a record-high R
NH3  (among TM-based
SACs, and in the unit of mol s −1  mg −1 ) of 1.98 × 10 −9  mol s −1
mg −1 (5.04 × 10 −10 mol s −1 cm −2 ) with a very high FE of 29.6%
at −0.2 V. The Ru atom with the valence state of ≈+ 3 was co-
ordinated by three to four N atoms, which was demonstrated to
be the catalytic sites [169] . Compared to Ru NPs on the nitrogen-
doped carbon (Ru NPs/N –C), Ru SAs/N –C exhibited much stronger
binding strength with N

2 and much lower (cid:2)G

R(EAS) [169] .

pected, TM-based SACs exhibit both high activity and selectivity to-
ward EAS compared to other TM-based catalysts, and the Fe- and
Ru-based SACs have the best catalytic performance. The underlying
reason can be explained as follows: i) The electron-deficient SAs
sites, which is a Lewis acid site, can accommodate the lone-pair
electrons of the N
2 molecule, which is weak Lewis base. This ac-
commodation is beneficial in promoting the adsorption and activa-
2 molecule. ii) The positively charged SAs and carbon-
tion of the N
based support could inhibit the adsorption of the proton, result-
ing in the suppression of HER. iii) SACs have high capacity against
disintegration and poisoning because of their high thermodynamic
and chemical stabilities. iv) For the Fe and Ru SAs, the appropri-
N2  could minimize the (cid:2)G for all the steps during the EAS
ate E
process according to the BEP and scaling relations.

4.5. Non-metal-based catalyst

Compared  to  TM-based  catalysts,  non-metal-based  catalysts
with small E
H and abundant valence electrons can provide a new
opportunity to develop high active EAS electrocatalysts with high
selectivity. Recently, some experimental exploration has been re-
ported for non-metal-based electrocatalysts, most of whom exhibit
high FE [175–185] .

Sun  and  co-workers  developed  boron  carbide  nanosheet  (B
4 C
NS) as a high selectivity catalyst for EAS and reached a high FE of
NH3 of 4.34 × 10 −11 mol s −1 mg −1 at −0.75 V in
15.95% with an R
0.1 M HCl [175] . DFT studies confirmed the catalytic site is the two
vertical B atoms located on two adjacent B clusters, and this site
could bond to the two terminal N atoms separately ( Fig. 23 ) with a
N2 of −0.63 eV [175] . Further, B
4 C NS can strongly stabilize
large E
most of the intermediates, making the (cid:2)G
R(EAS) as low as 0.34 eV
even at 0.00 V ( Fig. 23 ) [175] . However, the strong interaction with
intermediates results in a high (cid:2)G
NH3-des , which should account
for the low NH

3 yield [175] .

Wang  and  co-workers  exfoliated  the  bulk  phosphorus  by  a
facile liquid exfoliation method to develop a few-layer black phos-
phorus nanosheets (FL-BP NSs) catalyst [177] . Benefiting from the
abundant active sites provided by the lamellar structure, FL-BP NSs
NH3 of 5.13 × 10 −10 mol s −1 mg −1 with an FE of
exhibited a high R
5.07% [177] . Molecular orbitals of the FL-BP NSs were calculated
to investigate the electron distribution, and the HOMO and LUMO
electron  densities  were  respectively  concentrated  on  the  zigzag
and diff-zigzag edges, indicating these two edges were the active

tion temperature and time have a significant influence on the NH
3
yield  ( Fig.  24 a),  indicating  the  catalytic  activity  is  related  to  the
reduction of pyridinic N content ( Fig. 24 b) [176] . Theoretical calcu-
lations further disclosed the carbon vacancies (CVs) caused by re-
moving one pyridinic N and the adjacent three pyridinic N atoms
are the active sites ( Fig. 24 c). It’s worth noting that, however, the
calculated  (cid:2)G
R(EAS)  is  as  high  as  1.45  eV  at  −0.3  V  ( Fig.  24 d),
which means the catalytic activity of single site is not that high,
3 yield should be attributed to the high surface
thus the high NH
area  (1100  m 2  g −1 ),  porous  structure,  and  abundant  active  sites
[176] .

Most  recently,  Qiao  and  co-workers  theoretically  and  experi-
mentally investigated the EAS catalytic activity of O-, S-, Se-, and
Te-doped  C  catalysts  [186] .  Using  DFT  calculations,  they  demon-
N2  ( −0.568 eV) of Te-doped C, in which the C
strated that the E
atom accumulates the most charge, is much larger than that of un-
doped C ( −0.009 eV), which means the heteroatom-doping could
induce charge accumulation of the C atoms, resulting in a signif-
2  adsorption  [186] .  The  advantage  of  nega-
icant  promotion  in  N
tively charged non-metal atom on N
2  adsorption is also demon-
strated on the B-based catalyst [99] . Further, the spin polarization
effect caused by heteroatom-doping is clarified, that is the forma-
tion free energy of ∗NHH ( (cid:2)G
NNH ) has a linear correlation with the
spin moment of C atom [186] . C atom in Te-doped C has the largest
spin moment (0.113 μ
B ) among these catalysts, thus possesses the
lowest (cid:2)G
NNH (1.29 eV) [186] . EAS performance experiments show
NH3 and FE of Te-doped C (3.12 × 10 −11 mol
that the maximum R
s −1  cm −2  and 4.67%) are much higher than those of undoped C
(4.08 × 10 −12 mol s −1 cm −2 and 0.74%), which are consistent with
the DFT calculations well [186] .

The  comparison  of  the  catalytic  performance  of  the  reported

non-metal-based electrocatalyst for EAS is shown in Fig. 25 ( R
NH3
in the units of mol s −1  cm −2 ) and Fig. S3 ( R
NH3  in the units of
mol s −1 mg −1 ). Obviously, the selectivity of the boron-based cata-
lyst is high compared to other catalysts, which is consistent with
the previous DFT calculations [99] . Carbon materials with porous
structure and atomic vacancies defects, including NVs in polymeric
carbon nitride containing NVs catalyst (PCN –NV4) [178] and CVs in
metal-organic framework-derived nitrogen-doped nanoporous car-
bon catalyst (C-ZIF-10 0 0–1 h) [176] could provide abundant active
sites, exhibiting higher catalytic activity.

4.6. Strategies for catalyst design in improving the activity and
selectivity

To satisfy the demands of the greater development of the EAS
research and meet the needs of practical applications in the fu-
ture, the key factor, embodied the activity and selectivity of the
electrocatalyst, should be further improved. In this section of the
review, we highlight important intrinsic mechanisms for boosting
the NH
3  yield and efficiency in the EAS process, summarize cor-
responding strategies for catalyst design, as well as outline several
typical cases of implementing these strategies ( Fig. 26 ).

As respectively presented in Sections 3 and  4 , numerous theo-
retical calculations and experimental explorations have shown that
the catalytic performance depends heavily on the intrinsic prop-
erty and structure of the catalyst. Distinct from the universal as-
sociative mechanisms which are used to describe elementary steps
during the EAS process, the intrinsic mechanisms mainly focus on
the key factors for enhancing activity and selectivity, i.e., the acti-
vation of N

2 molecules and the suppression of HER.

As shown in Fig. 26 , six intrinsic mechanisms from the macro-
scale to electronic-scale (bottom to top) and six corresponding cat-
alyst design strategies were outlined. Three of the intrinsic mech-
anisms could improve the catalytic activity (blue octagons) while
two of them could improve the selectivity (violet octagons). Fur-
ther,  the  electron-deficient  sites  could  improve  both  the  activity
and selectivity. Here, no “one-to-one” correspondence between in-
trinsic mechanism and design strategy can be summarized. For in-
stance, the strategy of atomic dispersion could provide four intrin-
sic properties, including the shift of d -band center, the creation of
electron-deficient sites, the introduction of HER inert phase, and
the creation of more active sites, which could boost EAS and in-
hibit HER simultaneously. In general, the more intrinsic properties
provided  by  the  design  strategy,  the  better  the  catalytic  perfor-
mance is. As shown in Figs. 13 , 18 , 22 , and 25 , the atomic disper-
sion, vacancy creation, and nanohybrid construction are the most
promising catalyst design strategies until now.

Electrocatalysts with the same active center element but differ-
ent design strategies showed different intrinsic mechanisms, thus
exhibited totally different catalytic performances in the EAS pro-
cess. For example, the performance difference of the Ru bulk cata-
lyst (2.12 × 10 −11 mol s −1 cm −2 and 0.28%) [120] , Ru/2H-MoS
2 cat-
alyst (1.14 × 10 −10 mol s −1 cm −2 and 17.6%) [104] , and Ru SAs/N –C

catalyst (5.04 × 10 −10  mol s  − 1  cm −2  and 29.6%) [169] can be
well explained in this way. For the electrochemically deposited Ru
bulk  catalyst,  the  insufficient  unsaturated  active  sites  and  the  H
poisoning  extremely  limited  the  adsorption  and  activation  of  N
2
2 cata-
molecules but promoted HER ( Fig. 5 a). For the Ru/2H-MoS
lyst, the strategy of nanohybrid construction was implemented, re-
sulting in: i) the creation of more active sites on the high-index
facets by Ru NPs dispersion; ii) the suppression of HER owing to
the specific conduction band (CB) energy level of 2H-MoS
2 ; iii) the
separation of EAS and HER ( Fig. 11 b). For the Ru SAs/N –C catalyst,
two important intrinsic properties were introduced by implement-
ing the strategy of atomic dispersion, they are: i) atomically dis-
persed low-coordinated (CN = 3–4) Ru atoms provided abundant
2 molecule
catalytic sites; ii) positively charged Ru atoms attract N
but repel the proton, thus promoting EAS and inhibiting HER si-

multaneously. In other words, the natures of catalytic activity of
theses Ru-based catalyst are the same — the appropriate E
N2 ; how-
ever, the nature of Ru bulk catalyst was “obscured” in electrolysis
system under mild conditions, while the natures of Ru/2H-MoS
2
and Ru SAs/N –C catalysts were “protected” and even “enhanced”
by implementing the specific catalyst design strategies.

5. Key experimental techniques for electrocatalytic ammonia
synthesis

To conduct an insightful and efficient study for EAS, experimen-
tal techniques for the preparation and characterization of the cata-
lysts, the electrochemical techniques for the evaluation of the cat-
alyst, the investigation techniques for the intermediates, and the
detection techniques for the products, should be considered.

Here, some key characterization techniques for the adsorption
of N
2 , the catalytic sites, and the intermediates involved in EAS,
as well as the detection techniques for the products are reported.
With the help of these techniques, understanding of the EAS mech-
anism could be deepened and the reliability and accuracy of the
NH
3  quantification could be improved, which would, in turn, ac-
celerate the research in this field.

5.1. Characterization techniques for adsorption of nitrogen

Thermal  desorption  spectroscopy  is  a  useful  tool  to  describe
the temperature-dependent desorption process on the surface of
a catalyst [187] . N
2 -TPD with a thermal conductivity detector can
directly reveal the amount and the strength of the absorbed N
2
molecules. The physically adsorbed N
2  molecules with small ad-
sorption  energy  might  desorb  at  a  lower  temperature  (such  as
180 °C) while the chemically adsorbed N
2 molecules would desorb
at higher temperatures (such as 270 °C). Typically, pretreatment of
2 gas at 120 °C should
the catalyst with pure He gas coupled with N
be employed to eliminate the influence of other gases from sur-
rounding [188] .

XPS which provides the information concerning the core lev-
2 adsorption on the Fe-
els has been widely used to characterize N
based catalysts in the studies of Haber-Bosch process [189–194] .

The binding energies (BEs) in the N 1 s region of nitrogen with dif-
ferent adsorption states are summarized in Table 2 . On the metal
Fe surfaces, γ -, δ-, and α-N
2 molecules can only be observed be-
low 85 K because they would dissociate into β-N atoms at higher
temperature  owing  to  the  high  catalytic  activity  of  Fe.  However,
it  is  possible  to  detect  physically  and  chemically  absorbed  N
2
molecules on the surface of electrocatalyst for EAS since the dis-
sociation is difficult to occur. To obtain a reliable characterization
2  by the  XPS, two  suggestions are offered: i)
for  the adsorbed N
the N-containing catalyst is to be avoided; ii) a pretreatment (like
that before N
2 -TPD) to “clean” the surface should be employed to
remove the pre-adsorbed N-containing molecules.

present the vibration information of the absorbed N
However,  the  strict  requirements  for  sample  preparation  limited
the applications of the HREELS. Fortunately, the infrared absorp-
tion spectroscopy (IR) can disclose the vibration property as well.
For example, Imamura et al. [195] used IR to characterize the ad-
2  molecules  on  the  surface  of  the  Ru-based  catalyst  at
sorbed  N
15 kPa of N
2  and 30 °C. As shown in Fig. 27 a, the bands around
~2150 cm −1 are associated with the N –N stretch vibration ( ν(N –N))
of absorbed N
2 molecules [195] . These bands are lower than that
2 molecule (2331 cm −1 ) [34] . Further, with the promotion
of free N
of Cs + , much lower bands at ~1810 cm −1 were obtained, indicat-

5.2. Characterization techniques for active sites

Apart  from  the  universal  characterization  techniques  for  the
morphology  (SEM),  structure  (XRD,  TEM,  Raman,  and  IR),  va-
lence state (XPS), and composition (XPS and EDS) of the catalyst,
some techniques could reveal the unpaired electrons, the electronic
structure, and the chemical bonding of the active sites. For exam-
ple, the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy and electron
paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy could examine the un-
paired electrons in the materials. Specifically, the symmetric sig-
nal at g = ~2 is related to the trapped electron in the positively
charged defect sites, such as the OVs and NVs. Further, the inten-
sity of the signal qualitatively varies with the concentration of the
atom vacancies ( Fig. 16 a).

The X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) techniques, including
X-ray  absorption  near-edge  structures  spectroscopy  (XANES)  and
EXAFS, are powerful tools to disclose the electronic structures and
the structural information at the atomic scale. For SACs, these two
techniques  were  employed to  characterize  the  valence  state,  lig-
and, and coordination number of the atomically dispersed atoms.
In  a  XANES  spectrum,  an  absorption  edge  with  a  higher  energy
level and a white line with higher height compared to the refer-
ence  sample  indicates  the  electron-deficiency  of  the  atoms  ( Fig.
27 b).  In  a  Fourier  transform  (FT)  EXAFS  spectrum,  the  coordi-
nation  peaks  with  different  bond  lengths  are  related  to  the  dif-
ferent  ligands  ( Fig.  20 d).  Additionally,  by  comparing  the  fitting
curves with different structural parameters and the EXAFS curve,
the coordination numbers of the atoms can be further disclosed
( Fig. 21 b).

The center of the d -band measured relative to the Fermi level
is a successful descriptor of the catalytic activity for EAS, since it
can directly affect the electron filling of antibonding states when
2 molecules contact with the surface of the catalyst. Gener-
the N
ally, the d -band center is calculated by the means of DFT calcu-
lations which need complex and time-consuming simulation pro-
cesses. However, the XPS or ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy
(UPS) valence band spectra can also provide the information of the
d -band  center.  For  instance,  Huang  et  al.  [151]  demonstrated  an
upshift of the d -band center toward the Fermi level of Fe
3 /Cu
nanohybrid compared to that of Fe
3 powder by employing the
XPS valence band measurements ( Fig. 27 c).

5.3. Characterization techniques for intermediates

Compared with the various characterization techniques for the
catalyst  mentioned  above,  the  characterization  technique  for  the
intermediates is very limited owing to the complicated electrolysis
environment and the violent HER. To date, only IR could provide

information about the intermediates during the EAS process [ 181 ,
200 , 201 ].

Shao  and  co-workers  employed  an  attenuated  total  reflection
surface-enhanced  infrared  absorption  (ATR-SEIRAS)  technique  to
investigate the reaction intermediates, thus study the EAS mech-
anisms on the surfaces of Au [201] and Ru [200] . Fig. 28 a presents
the  FTIR  spectra  on  the  surface  of  Au  with  the  cathodic  poten-
tial from 0.4 to −0.5 V in an N
2 -saturated 0.1 M KOH [200] . The
bands at 3300 and 1645 cm −1  were respectively associated with
the  O –H  stretching  ( ν(O –H))  and  H –O-H  bending  ( δ(H –O-H))  of
the adsorbed H
2 O molecules [201] . The bands at 1450 and 1109
cm −1 were attributed to the H –N-H bending ( δ(H –N-H)) and N –N
stretching ( ν(N –N)) of the ∗N
2 H x  (2 ≤ x ≤ 4), respectively [201] .
Obviously, these two bands started to appear at 0 V and the in-
tensities  became  stronger  when  the  potential  is  more  negative,
demonstrating  that  EAS  goes  through  a  conventional  associative
pathway, in which the dissociation of N –N bonds may occur after
the penultimate hydrogenation step, with a fairly low onset poten-
tial on the surface of Au [201] .

The  intermediates  on  the  surface  of  Ru  are  distinctive  ( Fig.
28 b).  A  band  associated  with  the  N  =  N  stretching  ( ν(N  =  H),
1924 cm −1 ) of ∗N
2 H y  (1 ≤ y ≤ 2) appeared, and no signal from

N –N stretching (1109 cm −1 ) of ∗N
2 H x (2 ≤ x ≤ 4) can be observed
[200] .  Further,  The  intensity  of  the ν(N  =  N)  band  enhanced  at
the potential < 0 V, implying the coverage of ∗N
2 H y became higher
with a more negative potential. This means EAS goes through an
unconventional associative pathway on the surface of Ru, in which
the RDS is the dissociation of N = N bonds [200] .

2 gas [207] . In ad-
tected NH
dition, the use of isotope 15 N
2 is a good choice to distinguish the
N source. Specifically, in the region of 6.8 to 7.05 ppm of 1 H NMR
spectrum, 14 NH
+ has

two symmetric signals [208] . Further, some 15 N-containing impuri-
ties should be removed from the 15 N
2 feed gas before the 1 H NMR
measurements [202] .

5.4. Detection techniques for ammonia

Until  now,  the  NH

3  concentration  in  the  electrolyte  solution
after  electrolysis  is  still  at  an  extremely  low  level  (sub-mg  L −1
and  even μg  L −1 )  [202]  despite  numerous  encouraging  progress
has been reported. Additionally, trace amounts of coexisting metal
cations  and  organic  compounds  could  also  influence  the  detec-
tion result. Consequently, the reliable and accurate quantification
of NH
3 yield and
energy efficiency.

3 plays a significant role in the evaluation of NH

Spectrophotometric  methods,  including  the  Nessler’s  reagent
and the indophenol blue methods [ 203 , 204 ], are widely used in
the field of EAS. As the most common detection methods for NH
3
+ , in fact), the spectrophotometric methods have the advan-
(NH
4
tages  of  easy  operation,  large  detection  range,  and  cost  saving.
However,  since  many  other  materials  may  react  with  the  chro-
mogenic reagents, overestimation and significant errors caused by
coexisting  metal  cations  and  organic  compounds  have  been  re-
ported.  For  example,  Zhang  and  co-workers  systematically  stud-
ied the interference of metal cations and organic compounds and
found  that  Ru 3 + ,  Ce 3 + ,  and  Fe 2 +  cations  caused  a  relative  error
of  ~30%  when  using  the  Nessler’s  reagent  method,  and  CH
3 OH,
HCOOH, and HCHO even led to a significant underestimation by
employing  the  indophenol  blue  method  [205] .  Further,  poor  re-
peatability  of  the  spectrophotometric  methods  was  also  demon-

Ion chromatography (IC) exhibited high selectivity with the ad-
vantages of easy operation and time saving when detecting cations.
Recently, our group evaluated the accuracy and precision of the IC
3  with  low  concentration  [206] .  Our
for  the  quantification  of  NH
results demonstrated that IC has excellent linearities, high repeata-
bility, and low detection limits ( < 2 μg L −1 ) under acidic and neu-
+ concentration range of 0–400 μg
tral conditions even in the NH
4
L −1 . Further, we also found IC possesses good robustness against
the  interference  of  coexisting  materials,  that  is  14  common  TM
cations and 5 common organic compounds could hardly affect the
+  detection  by  IC  [206] .  Nevertheless,  IC  still  has  some  dis-
NH
4
advantages: i) High concentration of Li + and Na + can cause over-
+ peaks in chromatogram; this problem can be solved
lap with NH
4
by employing a high-exchange-capacity column or gradient elution
system, however, expensive and complex accessories are needed.
ii) Although the pH limit of IC can be extended to 12 [206] , the
+ range ( < 100 μg L −1 ) under alkaline
reliability of IC in low NH
4
condition is not satisfactory.

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique, which has strong
capability against the interference from coexisting materials, can

be  employed  to  accurately  quantify  NH
4
NMR rather than 14 N NMR is preferable for NH
+  with low con-
4
centration due to the high sensitivity [202] . For this method, the
biggest  issue  is  the  inconvenience  of  detection  since  a  common
laboratory could afford a spectrophotometer or an ion chromato-
graph but not an NMR spectrometer. Further, if the isotope labeling
experiment is conducted, a complex gas circulation setup should
be used to reduce the cost of expensive 15 N
2 gas and remove the
possible contamination [202] .

Apart from the interference effect, NH

3 contamination from wa-
ter [205] , catalyst [205] , reagent [206] , atmosphere [206] , feed gas
[202] ,  and  even  human  breath  [202]  were  recognized.  A  control
experiment  using  Ar  as  feed  gas  is  necessary  to  ensure  the  de-

6. Conclusion and outlook

The  electrocatalytic  synthesis  of  ammonia  from  nitrogen  and
water  under  mild  conditions  by  employing  renewable  electricity
provides  a  viable  alternative  for  producing  ammonia  through  a
green, clean, and sustainable route. In this review, an in-depth dis-
cussion  of  the  fundamentals  of  the  electrocatalytic  synthesis  of
ammonia was undertaken at the atomic level based on the pre-
vious studies of the Haber-Bosch process. Recent theoretical calcu-
lations for screening electrocatalysts were presented. Advances in
the rational design for electrocatalysts and corresponding design
strategies for boosting catalytic activity and selectivity were evalu-
ated. Key characterization techniques for active sites and interme-
diates, as well as reliable and accurate detection techniques for the
product, were provided. In summary, with numerous efforts during
the past decades, encouraging achievements have been made. Typ-
ically, the ammonia generation rate ( R
NH3 ) and Faradaic efficiency
(FE) have been respectively increased from ~10 −12  mol s −1  cm −2
and < 1% to 10 −11 –10 −10 mol s −1 cm −2 and ~10% in recent years.
However, there is still a long way to go of EAS to replace the con-
ventional Haber-Bosch process. For energy efficiency, at least a FE
of 50% is needed if the EAS technology is to be used to meet the
requirement of ammonia-based fertilizers for a typical one-hectare
3 /year) with a 10-m 2  commercial so-
field of corn (100 kg of NH
lar  panel  [ 11 ,  209 ].  For  the  yield  of  NH
NH3  of  the  most
active  catalyst  is  ~10 −9  mol  s −1  mg −1 ,  which  is  still  more  than
one order of magnitude less than that in the Haber-Bosch process
(~5 × 10 −8 mol s −1 mg −1 ) [210] . Therefore, to meet the needs of
practical application, some key challenges of EAS remain. These in-
clude:

ii) The NH

i) The FEs in most of the reaction systems are low (around 10%),
which  means  high  energy  requirement  and  low  energy  effi-
ciency in practical applications. To improve the selectivity to-
ward EAS, lowering the proton concentration and limiting the
proton transfer in non-aqueous electrolyte solutions (ionic liq-
uids or organics) are feasible [ 211 , 212 ]. For example, MacFar-
lane  and  co-workers  achieved  a  very  high  FE  of  60%  with  a
6,6,6,14 ][eFAP] ionic liquid
nanostructured Fe-based catalyst in [P
2 O was tightly
[213] . In this system, not only the content of H
2 gas was obtained [213] .
controlled, but also high solubility of N
3 generation rates in most of the reaction systems are
low,  resulting  in  a  huge  electrode  surface  and  catalyst  load-
ing in practical applications. Apart from the low catalytic ac-
tivity, extremely low current density (even several μA cm −1 )
with fairly positive cathodic potential, which is used to achieve
higher FE accounts for the low NH
3  yield as well. This is be-
cause  the  concentration  of  surface  electrons  can  be  limited,
thus suppressing HER. However, as a six-electron-proton trans-
fer process, the reaction rate of EAS was also significantly lim-
ited.  As  a  comparison,  recent  advanced  CO
2 RR  systems  can
achieve  high  FEs  (90–100%)  with  high  current  densities  (10–
100  mA  cm −1 )  [214–216] .  Therefore,  it  is  suggested  that  im-
proving the selectivity of the catalyst is more important than
just pursuing high FE in the future.

iii) Advanced  characterization  techniques  for  EAS  is  insufficient.
Recently, numerous advanced characterization techniques have
played  crucial  roles  in  studying  the  electronic  structures  and

structural information of the active sties under reaction condi-
tions. However, owing to the complexity of the electrocatalytic
system, only the SEIRAS technique has been employed to inves-
tigate the intermediates during the EAS process on the surfaces
of Au, Ru, Pt, and N, P co-doped carbon [ 181 , 200 , 201 ]. Rare
reports are given on the electrochemical method for studying
the EAS mechanism. In the future, Tafel plots, rotating ring disk
electrode,  and  scanning  electrochemical  microscopy  measure-
ments should be employed to study the EAS mechanism if the
response signal can be managed to distinguish EAS from the vi-
olent HER.

iv) Advanced  detection  techniques  for  the  generated  ammonia
should be developed. In most cases, the quantification of the
generated ammonia was realized through the indirect ways, in
which the electrolyte solution or absorption solution after a pe-
riod of electrolysis (typically one or more hours) was collected
and then analyzed by different detection methods. However, to
obtain more meaningful information about the reaction kinet-
ics, reliable and accurate on-line detection techniques for am-
monia should be developed.

v) The reliability and accuracy of the quantitative results of the
EAS  study  should be  carefully  confirmed.  The  applicability of
different detection techniques should be evaluated in the spe-
cific electrocatalytic system before the study to eliminate the
interference from coexisting ions, organic compounds, and pH
value. To avoid ammonia contamination from water, reagents,
catalysts, and atmosphere, rigorous control experiments are re-
quired. Recently, some detailed and meaningful control experi-
ment protocols have been reported [ 16 , 202 , 205 , 207 ].
