Thermoacoustic oscillations associated with transverse acoustic modes are routinely encountered in
combustion chambers. While a large literature on this topic exists for rockets, no systematic reviews of
transverse oscillations are available for air-breathing systems, such as in boilers, aircraft engines, jet engine
augmentors, or power generating gas turbines. This paper reviews work on the problem for air-breathing
systems, summarizing experimental, modeling, and active control studies of transverse oscillations. It then
details the key physical processes controlling these oscillations by describing transverse acoustic wave
motions, the effect of transverse acoustic waves on hydrodynamic instabilities, and the influence of acoustic
and hydrodynamic fluid motions on the unsteady heat release. This paper particularly emphasizes the
distinctions between the direct and indirect effect of transverse wave motions, by arguing that the domi-
nant effect of the transverse acoustics is to act as the “clock” that controls the frequency and modal structure
of the disturbance field. However, in many instances, it is the indirect axial flow disturbances at the nozzles
(driven by pressure oscillations from the transverse mode), and the vortices that they excite, that cause the
dominant heat release rate oscillations. Throughout the review, we discuss issues associated with simu-
lating or scaling instabilities, either in subscale experimental geometries or by attempting to understand
instability physics using identical nozzle hardware during axial oscillations of the same frequency as the
transverse mode of interest. This review closes with a model problem that integrates many of these con-
trolling elements, as well as recommendations for future research needs.

1. Introduction

This paper reviews the current state of understanding of
transverse combustion instabilities, which are problematic in a
variety of systems. For example, approaches for meeting increas-
ingly stringent emissions regulations and efficiency demands have
led to thermoacoustic oscillation problems in gas turbines used for
power generation and propulsion.
In particular, combustors
running in a lean, premixed mode are highly susceptible to self-
excited, combustion driven oscillations. This is in part due to the
loss in acoustic damping associated with the secondary air inlet
holes that are present in conventional diffusion flame combustors.
For example, transverse oscillations in annular aircraft or aeroder-
ivative combustors have been described by General Electric, Pratt &
Whitney, Solar Turbines, and Rolls Royce [1e4]. Similarly, trans-
verse acoustic oscillations in annular frame-engine combustors
have been described by Siemens and Alstom [5,6]. Transverse
acoustic oscillations in can-type combustors are generally higher
frequency than in annular systems (the exception being radial
modes in annular combustors) and have been described by Sewell
and Sobieski [7]. Finally, transverse oscillations have long been an
issue in jet engine augmentors [8e13]. Referred to as “screech”
because of its high-pitched tone, the transverse mode in augmen-
tors can be excited in addition to longitudinal acoustic oscillations,
referred to as “rumble” or “buzz” [14]. Transverse oscillations have
also been problematic in numerous rocket systems. While we note
analogies and commonalities in physics throughout, the focus of
this review is on air-breathing combustors and does not attempt to
comprehensively address the large literature on transverse oscil-
lations in rockets.

Combustion instability, a coupling between resonant combustor
acoustics and heat release rate fluctuations, is one of the leading
challenges in developing and operating both aircraft and power-
generation gas turbines [1]. Combustion instability is manifested
by acoustic and heat release rate oscillations inside the combustor
chamber. This feedback cycle between combustor acoustics and
heat release rate oscillations typically involves the three steps
outlined in Fig. 1. Heat release rate fluctuations add energy to the
acoustic field, leading to acoustic pressure and velocity fluctuations
that propagate throughout the combustor. These acoustic fluctua-
tions then excite vortical structures and fuel/air ratio oscillations
that, in turn, lead to further heat release fluctuations that close the
feedback loop.

A necessary condition for the oscillations to be self-excited is
that net energy must be added to the acoustic disturbance field by
the heat release. It can be shown that this occurs when the phase of
the heat release rate and pressure oscillations is within ±90(cid:3), i.e.,
the “Rayleigh criterion” [15]. This criterion is stated in a more
general time domain formulation in Eq. (1), which indicates that
the product of the heat release rate oscillation and the pressure

oscillation integrated over an acoustic cycle must be greater than
zero for the heat release to add energy to the acoustic field.3

Physically, the criterion states that the oscillating heat release,
which results in oscillations in local gas dilatation, transfers energy
to the acoustic field by periodically doing work on the gas when the
oscillations in heat release and pressure are in phase.

The conditions under which a system is linearly unstable, and
the resultant amplitude of the acoustic oscillations, are dependent
on the balance between disturbance growth and damping in the
combustor system. In an undamped system, the value of the inte-
gral in Eq. (1) must exceed zero for oscillations to grow. However,
all real systems possess some acoustic damping, and so the value of
the integral must be greater than the volume-integrated system
damping. Combustor damping sources include losses at inflow and
outflow boundaries, and flow oscillations through cooling holes in
the combustor liner excite vortices, transferring acoustic energy to
vortical flow motion [19]. Similarly, narrowband acoustic damping
at known problematic frequencies is often added with quarter-
wave tubes and Helmholtz resonators. These damping methods
are discussed further in Sec. 2.3.

When small amplitude oscillations are self-excited in linearly
unstable systems, the amplitude initially grows exponentially in
time. However, nonlinear effects modify the energy balance at
higher amplitudes, causing the amplitude to saturate into a limit
cycle, or some more complex orbit in the phase plane. For example,
the unsteady heat release oscillations often do not grow linearly
with acoustic disturbance amplitude, such as induced by saturation
in flame area fluctuations [20].

Even if the oscillations are not self-excited (i.e., if the heat
release rate oscillations do not add energy to the acoustic field, or if
the rate of energy addition does not exceed system damping),
significant oscillations can occur at resonant frequencies in damped
systems. These noise-driven oscillations can be understood by
considering the excitation of a slightly damped resonator with
broadband noise, which can achieve very large amplitudes for small
damping rates [17,21].

Combustion driven oscillations can be associated with any of the
natural acoustic modes of the combustor system, including the
longitudinal or the transverse modes e both radial and azimuthal.
By focusing on transverse acoustic disturbances, this review con-
centrates on the physics associated with acoustic oscillations
perpendicular to the mean-flow direction in the combustor. This is
in contrast to longitudinal oscillations, where acoustic fluctuations
oscillate in the direction of mean flow. Longitudinal oscillations
have been the focus of a number of studies; see reviews by Lieuwen
and Yang [1], McManus et al. [22], Ducruix et al. [23], Huang and
Yang [24], and Candel et al. [25]. While the dominant coupling
mechanisms between the acoustics and the flame response,
reviewed later in this section, are nominally the same between
longitudinal and transverse oscillations, the symmetry of the
acoustic disturbance is significantly different in these two cases.
Longitudinal modes excite symmetric disturbances along the flame,
meaning that the acoustic disturbance amplitude is roughly con-
stant at all azimuthal locations around the flame. However, this is
not true during transverse oscillations, where the incident acoustic

3 Note that unsteady heat release also adds energy to entropy disturbances. In
addition, other acoustic source terms also arise in the disturbance energy equation,
but are generally much smaller in magnitude for high Reynolds number flows
[16e18].

oscillations are non-axisymmetric with respect to the downstream
axis of the flame. This introduces new coupling pathways and
additional considerations. Since combustion driven oscillations are
associated with an unstable combustor system, another important
distinction between longitudinal and transverse oscillations is the
ability to accurately simulate them in sub-scale (laboratory) envi-
ronments. Such approaches are routinely used for longitudinal
mode studies, such as by studying the dynamics of a single or small
number of nozzles, and can be done with reasonable replication of
the acoustic mode structure. However, such sub-scale arrange-
ments are generally more challenging for transverse oscillations.

The mechanisms by which acoustic fluctuations in the
combustor excite flame heat release rate fluctuations have been
reviewed by several authors [17,23,26,27]. In general, coupling
between the acoustic field and the flame takes place through one or
more pathways where disturbances in the flow field, including
fluctuations in velocity, pressure, or mixture composition, drive
fluctuations in the flame heat release rate. We discuss these
coupling pathways with regards to transverse instabilities in Sec-
tion 7, but provide a basic overview here. “Velocity-coupled
response” refers to the sensitivity of the heat release rate to velocity
disturbances. The velocity disturbances are associated with both
acoustic and vortical velocity fluctuations [20,28e34], where the
vortical velocity fluctuations are excited by acoustic fluctuations, as
discussed in Section 6. Velocity fluctuations drive flame heat
release rate fluctuations through multiple pathways,
including
flame area fluctuations, mass burning rate fluctuations (induced by
oscillatory flame stretch and/or scalar dissipation rate), and oscil-
latory atomization/breakup processes. Typical characteristic delay
times between the excitation of the flow disturbance and the heat
release are convective in nature, usually involving the time
required for a vortex to convect from its point of initiation to the
midpoint of the flame (see also Secs. 4.2 and 5)

Fluctuations in mixture composition, or equivalence ratio, are
common in air-breathing systems as the fuel and air flow rates are
typically sensitive to acoustic disturbances. Thus, acoustic fluctua-
tions in the combustion chamber drive fluctuations in fuel flow rate
into the combustor, resulting in oscillations in local equivalence
ratio [1,35e40]. These variations in equivalence ratio drive heat
release rate fluctuations through a number of pathways, including
oscillations in the mixture heat of reaction and burning rate. Typical
characteristic delay times between the excitation of the fuel/air
disturbance and the heat release are also convective in nature,
associated with the convection time from the fuel injection point to
the midpoint of the flame (e.g., see Eq. (7)).

In addition, acoustic oscillations drive heat release rate oscilla-
tions through fluctuations in pressure, temperature, and density,
which are isentropically related in the acoustic field.
In air-
breathing systems, the effect of pressure fluctuations is often of
O (M) relative to velocity and fuel/air ratio coupling and, thus, is
weak in low Mach number flows [17,41e46].
In liquid-fueled
systems, fluctuations in pressure or velocity may also drive varia-
tion in fuel injection, atomization, and vaporization rates, further
leading to fluctuations in local equivalence ratio; much of the
literature on this liquid-driven coupling mechanism focuses on
liquid-rocket applications, although a smaller general literature
focuses on the response of sprays and droplets [47e49].

Users and operators of air-breathing systems often categorize
combustion instabilities by their frequency. For example, “high
frequency” instabilities are often termed “screech,” and “low fre-
quency” ones are referred to as “rumble” or “growl”. While this
distinction is useful in identifying different ranges in practice, it
does not necessarily imply that key coupling physics are different. A
more physics-based distinction is based upon relative time and
length scales; in particular, the flame response time scale relative

time to the acoustic period (the flame Strouhal number, St, in Eq.
(39)) and the acoustic wavelength relative to the nozzle dimension
or flame length - a flame that is small relative to a wavelength is
referred to as “acoustically compact”. For acoustically compact
flames, the distribution of the unsteady heat release is usually not
important; rather, the spatially integrated unsteady heat release
controls stability limits. In contrast, the spatial distribution of the
unsteady heat release is very important in non-compact flames, as
it is the relative phase of the local heat release and pressure that
controls the value of the Rayleigh integral in Eq. (1).

1.1. Transverse oscillations in liquid rockets

Transverse oscillations have been the focus of significant
investigation in liquid rockets. They are addressed in a number of
books and monographs, including Yang and Anderson [50], Crocco
et al. [51], Harrje and Reardon [52], and Dranovsky [53]. Initially,
large-scale rocket testing revealed several issues, including mid-to
high-frequency oscillations driven by a coupling between acoustic
disturbances and flow and/or combustion processes. These oscil-
lations were often abated with the use of baffles, Helmholtz reso-
nators, and alterations to spray and impingement patterns. Initially,
design of these abatement systems was largely empirical, but better
understanding of the structure of the acoustic mode, particularly
the transverse acoustic modes, reduced the number of design it-
erations required. Although the baffle and resonator solutions
proved useful, questions regarding the underlying coupling
mechanisms were often unanswered.

Several laboratory experiments have been designed to replicate
the dominant transverse mode measured in the rocket combustion
chambers, enabling a more detailed understanding of instability
mechanisms [50,54e66]. Test configurations include both single-
and multiple-injector configurations in a variety of high-pressure
chambers. A number of the laboratory combustors are rectan-
gular; in this configuration, the injectors are located on one side of
the chamber and the port for acoustic forcing is on a perpendicular
face. Some chambers, however, are cylindrical, including those for
both high- and low-pressure testing. The flame is typically forced
with a siren [63]. This configuration allows for a high back-pressure
on the forcing apparatus in order to achieve significant excitation
amplitudes, as well as frequency selection by variation of the siren's
rotation speed.

In addition, Reardon and coworkers [67,68] developed a “sector
motor” in which only a fixed sector angle of the engine was tested
by using copper inserts that blocked portions of the chamber. For
example, a combustor was fabricated that consisted of a 180(cid:3)
chamber (half the chamber), that displayed only the standing form
of an azimuthal mode. They also tested angles of 20, 60, 90, 120,
210, and 270(cid:3), and found that changing the angle of their variable
angle sector motor caused transition from stable operation at small
angles, to a self-excited “1T” mode, then to a self-excited “2T” mode
for angles larger than 180(cid:3).

self-excited oscillations.

These facilities enabled insight

into physical mechanisms
“Injector coupling,”
responsible for
meaning the acoustic coupling between the pressure oscillations at
the injector face associated with the acoustic mode in the chamber
and oscillations in reactant mass flow rates from the injector ele-
ments, was identified as a significant mechanism [69]. For example,
low pressure-drop injectors were shown to be highly susceptible to
thermoacoustic oscillations; increases in pressure drop, decreasing
the acoustic sensitivity of the nozzle flow rate, reduced the oscil-
lation magnitude [70].

However, other mechanisms are also important. For example,
one set of tests showed that increasing the pressure drop did not
in that case, disturbance
eliminate the oscillations. Rather,

amplitudes decreased by increasing the velocity ratio between the
fuel and oxidizer streams in a co-axial injector configuration [70].
This, along with positive results stemming from recessing one
stream, increasing the hydrogen temperature, and increasing the
thickness of the oxidizer tube, all suggest the additional role of
coupling of acoustic fluctuations and jet hydrodynamic instabilities.
Finally, jet breakup, atomization, and subsequent mixing of liquid
fuel and oxidizer streams also profoundly influence thermoacoustic
instability limits by affecting time delays between injection and
ignition [71e73].

While much research in the area of combustion instability in
rockets is on-going, many lessons from this research can be applied
to air-breathing architectures. For example, an analog of injector
coupling is similarly a dominant mechanism of transverse oscilla-
tions in annular combustors [74,75], and is the focus of Sec. 3.2.1.
Additionally, variations in liquid jet breakup, atomization, and
mixing are similarly important coupling mechanism in liquid-
fueled combustors [76].

1.2. Overview

As described above, there is a large literature on transverse os-
cillations in rocket environments. However, we are not aware of a
focused review of the problem in air-breathing systems. The
objective of this review is to summarize, synthesize, and suggest
areas for needed work for air-breathing systems, particularly gas
turbines. While this review addresses the general issues associated
with instabilities in both can and annular systems, it has a dis-
proportionally larger treatment of annular combustors, where
azimuthal disturbances are often the dominant mode of combus-
tion instability. The simple reason for this focus is that annular
systems are the subject of the majority of the open literature on the
topic.

Fig. 2 shows a conceptual model of an annular combustor, out-
lining the major geometric, acoustic, and flame features. We start
with the common upstream compressor discharge plenum (not
shown), which discharges into a ring of fuel nozzles. Here, only a
single ring of nozzles is shown, although multiple rings do exist in
fielded configurations [77]. Nozzle ‘s’ has a cross sectional area, Acs,s,
a length h, and a nozzle spacing ds. While the plenum has its own

instability.

acoustic characteristics that may also support azimuthal distur-
bances (e.g., see Bauerheim et al. [78]), for simplicity we parame-
terize everything upstream of the nozzle by the impedance
boundary condition, bZ o, which is a function of operating condition,
frequency, and acoustics of the upstream plenum. The flow-field
created by these nozzles is often highly complex and hydrody-
namically unstable, and the acoustic flow oscillations generally
excite large scale vortical disturbances that also enter the problem.
The flames, shown in blue, are located downstream of the nozzle
outlet.

The bolded black line in the figure indicates a transverse dis-
tance. An important simplification that we will utilize in several
places is that the cross sectional area of each inlet nozzle is much
smaller than that of an axially oriented cut through the combustor,
i.e., Acs,s/Acs,A ≪ 1. In this case, the unsteady volume flow rate
associated with transverse flow oscillations is generally much
larger than the volume flow oscillations in the nozzles, enabling us
to decouple their acoustics in many instances. In this way, the
azimuthal acoustic fluctuations act as a “clock,” setting the overall
frequency of the disturbance. These disturbances excite axial mo-
tions in the nozzle, which are often the dominant source of flame
response.

The acoustic boundary condition at the exit of the combustor is
denoted as bZ out. Parameterizing the outflow by this local boundary
condition is an approximation that is accurate in cases where the
nozzle dimensions are small relative to the acoustic wavelength
[79].

Although no corresponding figure is included, many similar
considerations apply for a can-combustion system. A key difference
however, is that the cross sectional area of the nozzles is on the
same order of magnitude as that of the combustor can, so that the
area ratio argument described above does not apply. In this case,
the acoustics of the region up and downstream of the flame are
integrally linked into an overall system mode, with a mode struc-
ture that cannot be decoupled. This renders the can-combustor
problem significantly more complicated.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Sec. 2 provides a
review of the experimental, analytical, and modeling studies of
transverse combustion instabilities in air-breathing combustor
systems. In addition to experimental and computational studies,
we discuss investigations into the control of transverse combustion
instabilities. Then, subsequent sections describe the key physical
processes during transverse combustion instabilities, with a dis-
cussion of acoustic field structure of transverse oscillations (Sec. 3),
excitation of hydrodynamic instabilities by transverse forcing (Sec.
4), flame response to transverse modes (Sec. 5), and an illustrative
model problem for transverse thermoacoustic instability (Sec. 6).
We conclude by identifying key gaps in understanding, and rec-
ommendations for future research topics.

2. Experimental, modeling, and combustion control efforts

This section summarizes experimental, modeling, and insta-
bility control efforts in the area of transverse combustion instability
for gas turbine applications, which are listed in Table 1.

2.1. Experimental investigations

Experimental investigations have considered self-excited and
open-loop transverse forcing flame response. Flame dynamics
during self-excited oscillations have been measured in both
laboratory-scale annular combustors and single-nozzle configura-
tions. Open-loop forcing studies have used single- or multi-nozzle
configurations that mimic a sector of an annular combustor.

Self-excited azimuthal modes were studied by Moeck and
Paschereit [105,106] in an annular geometry that used an array of
Rijke tubes with heated wire-mesh elements at atmospheric
pressure. Although no flame is present
in this facility, this
arrangement enables a means for manipulating heat release pro-
files/symmetry and characterizing their influence on azimuthal
mode behavior.

Worth and Dawson [100,101] presented results from the annular
combustor shown in Fig. 3(a). This facility allows for variation in the
number of nozzles (and hence nozzle spacing), direction of swirl of
each nozzle, inner and outer lengths of the combustor walls, fuel
type, equivalence ratio, and baffles. Both standing and spinning

modes could be excited by, for example, altering the relative swirl
directions in adjacent nozzles or insertion of baffles. The spin di-
rection of the mode was driven by the alignment of the local heat
release and the mean swirl direction in the annulus.

A similar but larger annular combustor was developed by
Bourgouin et al. [103], shown in Fig. 3(b), and tested for both swirl-
stabilized and matrix burner flames [104]. Visualization of the
flame behavior showed that flame response is largely driven by
transverse to longitudinal coupling at each nozzle, again showing
that the transverse mode acts as a “clock” to drive the flame
response. Studies from Sattelmayer and coworkers [154e157] used
an annular combustor to better understand the differences in flame

and is not correctly emulated. This method of testing nozzles has
been used for rocket injectors [159], and has been applied to air-
breathing hardware as well. Facilities at both Solar Turbines [4]
and General Electric [2] used this methodology for nozzle design
screening. Solar Turbines developed the single-nozzle rig to match
as many parameters as possible,
including the length of the
combustor, diameter and annulus height, flow velocities and inlet
temperatures. A translating plug assembly downstream of the
combustion zone was used to adjust the combustor length in order
to match the oscillation frequency to that of the engine [160].
Similarly, General Electric used a tunable length single-nozzle rig,
shown in Fig. 6, to sweep through oscillation amplitude depen-
dence as a function of frequency/chamber length and, thereby to
screen nozzles at known frequencies of concern for the engine [77].
Both studies admit the short-comings of these experiments,
particularly in that the flame is subjected to axial acoustic motions
in the screening test rig, but transverse acoustic motions in the
engine. However, at lower frequencies (100's of Hertz), the flame
and nozzle are acoustically compact with respect to the wavelength
of the transverse mode. We hypothesize that the apparent useful-
ness of results from this type of experiment stems from two points:
(1) the much larger sensitivity of compact flames to axial flow
disturbances than transverse disturbances (see Sec. 5), and (2) the
dependence of the axial flow oscillations from the nozzle upon the
oscillatory pressure from the transverse wave (see Sec. 3.2.1). For
this reason, we hypothesize that it is the scalar pressure oscillations
at the nozzle that must be replicated, something that can be done
with appropriate care in an acoustically compact case by matching
acoustic frequencies and nozzle impedances in either a transverse
or longitudinally self-excited system.

In addition to flame response in self-excited systems, flame
response to open-loop transverse acoustic forcing has been
measured in a number of facilities. Typically, these combustors
have been designed to mimic a thin-gapped annular combustor, as
if an annular combustor had been cut at an azimuthal position and
“unwrapped” to produce a high aspect ratio chamber, as shown in
the diagram in Fig. 7 [90]. Of course, curvature effects do render
differences between this system and real annular systems, partic-
ularly in cases where the annular gap is not small relative to the
overall outer radius of the annulus.

Several of these configurations have been built and operated.
The first combustor, from O'Connor et al. [85], consists of a high-
aspect ratio combustor with three adjustable speaker tubes on
each side for acoustic forcing. The relative phasing between these
drivers can be adjusted in order to simulate different standing wave
disturbance fields at the nozzle. Two different combustors with this
design are pictured in Fig. 8. Data from this experiment has pro-
vided information about the velocity disturbance field present in
swirl-stabilized flames
transversely-forced,
In
particular, the authors found that the structure of the acoustic field
at the nozzle (e.g., a pressure node vs. antinode), strongly affects the
local and global flame response. Similar facilities have subsequently
been built based on this design [90,91,93], all of which operate at
atmospheric pressure.

response to longitudinal acoustic modes in an annular and a single-
flame configuration, but no direct measurements of transverse
modes in this combustor appear to be published. These three
annular facilities were run at atmospheric pressure.

Self-excited oscillations have also been measured in sector
configurations where one or several flames in a geometry
mimicking a portion of a full combustor are investigated. Several
classic studies focused on transverse oscillations in augmentor
configurations. Experiments by Rogers and Marble [9], Elias [10],
and Kaskan and Noreen [11], all showed self-excited, transverse
oscillations in single-flame, bluff-body stabilized configurations at
near-atmospheric conditions. Elias also measured similar oscilla-
tions for two- and three-flame configurations. In all these studies,
asymmetric vortex shedding from alternating edges of the flame-
holder were observed, driven by the asymmetry of the transverse
acoustic mode relative to the combustor centerline. These data
show synchronization between transverse velocity fluctuations in
the chamber and vortex rollup on the flameholder, as can be seen in
Fig. 4.

[81e83,158]. Sattelmayer and coworkers [81e83] obtained results
from a configuration shown in Fig. 5 where self-excited, transverse
oscillations were present. Like the results from Rogers and Marble

motion in the combustion chamber.

Additionally, a subset of these single-flame test sections used
facilities that deliberately interrogated system behavior using lon-
gitudinal excitation at the same transverse oscillation frequencies
encountered in full-scale hardware. As noted in the introduction,
one of the key complexities associated with transverse oscillations
is accurately simulating them in sub-scale environments. Thus, in
approaches that reproduce acoustic frequencies, but not spatial
acoustic mode shapes, it is worthwhile to consider what physics is

measurements and open symbols are acoustic velocity measurements.

Experiments by Lespinasse and coworkers [96,97] used a similar
high-aspect-ratio chamber and a single acoustic driver on either
side of the axisymmetric bluff-body stabilized flame at atmospheric
conditions, as shown in Fig. 9(a). The distance between the walls of
the acoustic forcing chamber is variable so that the chamber can be
tuned to the wavelength of the forcing frequency. This is similar to
the adjustable tubes in the experiments from O'Connor et al. [85],
Malanoski et al. [90], and Emerson et al. [93]. The experiment en-
ables a transverse standing wave, as is shown in the acoustic
measurements in Fig. 9(b). Additionally, the nozzle location within
the experiment is variable so that flame response to different lo-
cations in a standing acoustic wave can be measured. Measure-
ments showed significant differences in local and global flame
response at various locations in the acoustic wave form.

Another design has been used by Hauser et al. [94,95] and Sau-
rabh and Paschereit [98], which enables both transverse and longi-
tudinal excitation. These T-shape combustors, shown in Fig. 10, have
been used to study both transverse forcing and combinations of
transverse and longitudinal forcing at atmospheric conditions. The
combination of transverse and longitudinal excitation, or “mixed-
mode” excitation, results in different flame response characteristics
over a range of frequencies. Additionally, traveling wave excitation
in the facility from Saurabh and Paschereit [99] has shown that the
flame response to traveling waves is similar to that of flames at
pressure anti-nodes, showing significant global heat release rate
fluctuation, a topic we will address further in Sec. 3.2.1.

Comparisons between sector rigs and full annular model com-
bustors have shown that key flame dynamics during self-excited

transverse oscillations can be faithfully captured in transverse
forcing facilities. A comparison study by O'Connor et al. [161]
showed that the symmetric and asymmetric response of the
flames at the pressure anti-node and node locations in an annular
combustor is consistent with the symmetric and asymmetric ve-
locity and vorticity response of the single transverse forced flame.
This study explained that a transverse-forcing facility should cap-
ture four major characteristics of the annular rig in order to capture
the proper flow and flame dynamics: the flow field, particularly the
vortex breakdown structure; the flame shape, particularly the
stabilization method; the acoustic compactness and resonances of
the system; and the flame spacing if multiple flames are present in
very close proximity.

Flameeflame interaction is important in closely spaced flames
[100], and is illustrated in Fig. 11, which compares two nozzle
configurations with different nozzle spacings. At the largest
spacing (Fig. 11(a)), the flames retain distinct shapes, but at the
smallest spacing (Fig. 11(b)), they are significantly merged in the
regions between the nozzles. This level of
interaction can
distinctly influence the flame dynamics, as will be discussed in
Sec. 5.

2.2. Modeling of transverse oscillations

Many modeling studies of transverse oscillations have been
performed for self-excited and forced systems. Approaches include
acoustic solvers, flamelet dynamics models, unsteady Reynolds-
averaged Navier Stokes (URANS) simulations, and large eddy sim-
ulations (LES); these are summarized in Table 1. These studies can
be roughly grouped into those that focus on the acoustics of the
system, those that focus on the flame dynamics of transversely
excited systems, and those that couple the flame dynamics with a
larger system level acoustics and stability model. This section
briefly surveys these approaches, as key results from many of them
are further detailed in the rest of this review.

A variety of methods have been used to assess the stability of
combustion systems [108e111,113,115,119,120,122e124,162e164].
These system-level models are particularly beneficial for deter-
mining the stability and mode shapes of combustion systems,
although calculating limit cycle amplitudes requires incorporation
of nonlinear effects that are automatically captured in LES calcu-
lations, but not necessarily so in reduced order models. An example
of a linear system modeling approach is provided in Section 6 for a

transverse instability problem that is reduced to a quasi-one
formulation. More generally, multi-dimensional
dimensional
acoustics can be captured by coupling Helmholtz solvers to flame
dynamics models as described later in this section.

Low-order flame modeling has provided detailed information
about local flame dynamics at a relatively low computational cost.
In particular, the use of level-set formulations for premixed flames
and mixture fraction formulations for non-premixed flames en-
ables a low-dimensional description of how flamelets respond to
perturbations [165e167]. In these formulations, the flamelet sur-
face is represented by the iso-contour of an implicit function, given
by Gð x!; tÞfor premixed flames and by the mixture fraction,
Zð x!; tÞfor nonpremixed flames. The evolution of this contour is
tracked using the G-equation [168,169] for premixed flames:

where the instantaneous flame position follows the Gð x!; tÞ 1⁄4 0

described by the Z equation, derived below assuming equal diffu-
sivities of all species [17]:

(3)

This approach can be generalized to include differential diffu-
sion effects by replacing it with the appropriate species equations.
In the fast chemistry limit, the nonpremixed flame sheet position
follows the Zð x!; tÞ 1⁄4 Zst 1⁄4 1=ð1 þ fOxÞ contour, where fOx is the
stoichiometric mass ratio of oxidizer to fuel. For example, in order
to consider the velocity-coupled flame response, the space-time
distribution of the vortical and acoustic velocity field can be
inserted into these expressions to determine the fluctuations in
flame position.

Ultimately, it is heat release rate oscillations that drive ther-
moacoustic oscillations. The instantaneous heat release rate is
_q1product shown
spatially distributed, and it is the value of the p1
in Eq. (1) that determines whether energy is locally added or
removed from the acoustic field by the heat release fluctuations.
However,

release is unimportant [170,171]. Within the flamelet formula-

Flame transfer functions are used extensively in the literature to
describe the amplitude and phase of the flame response as a
function of frequency [22,32,172e174]; the flame describing func-
tion provides a nonlinear extension of this concept [175,176]. The
flame transfer function is defined as:

where bu1;ref denotes some suitable reference perturbation velocity
[75]. The analysis using the FTF has been performed for both
premixed [75,92,126,177] and non-premixed flames [170,178,179].
While these transfer functions can be quite complex, a commonly
used simplification for the flame response is the so-called n (cid:2) t
model:

This time-domain equation relates the unsteady heat release
rate to the flow disturbances (assumed to be the velocity in this
case, but could also be a superposition of other disturbances such as
pressure and fuel/air ratio as well). It can be shown that the net
model accurately describes velocity-coupled premixed flame
=u0≪1 limit, where t is proportional to Lf/u0 (e.g.,
response in the fLf
for laminar 2-D flames, t 1⁄4 Lf/2u0 [17]). Note also that the time
delay and phase of the FTF are related by ut 1⁄4 :bF ðuÞ. Section 5
describes further the factors influencing the flame response to
transverse disturbances.

Models for the heat release rate can be used in larger system
acoustics/disturbance models. For example, the Helmholtz equa-
tion with a heat release source term is given by:

flow effects but can describe three-dimensional oscillations in
arbitrarily complex geometries. Initial studies using this approach
utilized simplified geometries that were one dimensional. Some of
these initial studies were carried out by Merk [180], and then for
industrial systems by Putnam [181], afterburners by Bloxsidge et al.
[182], and a Rijke tube by Heckl [183]. A system of components
whose acoustics are approximated as one-dimensional can also be
coupled into a network model to describe more complex three-
dimensional geometries, such as described by Bohn and Deuker
[184]. More generally, finite element methods can be used to solve
the acoustic wave equation for complex three dimensional geom-
etries [116,118] to calculate the eigenfrequencies of the system and
disturbance growth/decay rates; e.g., Campa et al. [117] used this
approach to model the acoustics of a full annular combustor
configuration that consists of a plenum, burners and the combus-
tion chamber.

Describing nonlinear phenomenon, such as limit cycle ampli-
tudes requires incorporation of nonlinear effects. This can be done
either with full computations, or with hybrid models. For example,
as discussed further in the next section, acoustic amplitudes are
often sufficiently low that acoustic/gas dynamic processes remain
linear, while it is heat release or boundary damping effects that are
nonlinear. In this case, time-domain solutions of the linearized
wave equations can be coupled with nonlinear heat release
models or nonlinear boundary conditions in order to capture
nonlinear phenomenon [115,185]. For example, Graham and
Dowling [125] coupled a series of quasi-one-dimensional time
domain solutions to describe acoustic motions in an annular
combustor, coupled to a nonlinear heat release model. A higher
fidelity approach was presented by Wolf et al. [133], using a
Helmholtz solver with unsteady heat release rates provided by
LES.

Some URANS work has also been reported for predicting global
features of flame response to transverse instabilities [130]. Large-
eddy simulation has provided a detailed view of flame dynamics
in both sector simulations [6,136,137,139] and full-annular simu-
lations [74,131e133], such as shown in Fig. 12. In addition to
describing bulk acoustic features, such as frequency, these com-
putations also enable description of more complex time-dependent
behavior, such as nonlinear behaviors or the intermittent switching
between standing and spinning modes, features that a Helmholtz
solver cannot resolve. However, even in high fidelity computations,
there are difficulties in predicting instability boundaries and
oscillation amplitudes due to uncertainty in boundary conditions
and numerical damping in the system. These issues disrupt the
balance between driving and damping that determines the
amplitude, or even existence, of the instability, and so true pre-
dictive capability has eluded the community to date. Despite these
deficiencies, physical driving mechanisms can be retrieved from
these data as well as trends in instability amplitude, which are
important metrics for comparison between experimental data and
computational prediction. For example, these simulations suggest
that the dominant coupling mechanism between the transverse
acoustic mode and flame heat release rate fluctuations is the
injector coupling mechanism, which causes axial flow pulsations
[74,132].

2.3. Control of transverse oscillations

Control of combustion instabilities can be achieved through
both active and passive means. Passive control techniques are most
typically found on hardware currently in operation, and include
such techniques as resonators, pilot fuel, and fuel staging. Active
control is not typically found in industrial hardware, but it is
noteworthy that the only field utilization of active control on a large
frame engine was applied to a transverse instability [152].

Passive control techniques,

including Helmholtz resonators,
quarter-wave tubes, and perforated plates, are used to damp
acoustic oscillations by both resistive and reactive processes [142].
Perforated plates damp acoustic oscillations by transferring fluc-
tuating acoustic energy into vortical motion at the edges of the
plate's holes. Typical combustor liner configurations contain
several perforations to allow cooling air to enter the combustor, and
also act to damp acoustic oscillations.

Helmholtz resonators and quarter-wave tubes are dominantly
reactive devices, although the large amplitude oscillations at the
resonator outlet generally also lead to an amplitude dependent
resistive acoustic damping as well. Fig. 13 illustrates a commercial

annular combustor during azimuthal acoustic mode oscillations. Reproduced from

combustor with quarter wave tubes in the combustor plenum used
for damping transverse oscillations [77]. Damper tubes of either
type are used widely across the industry [143] and have been used
on rocket engines as well [52]. Design and placement of such
resonant devices is critical for their effectiveness. Stow and Dow-
ling showed that the required number of resonators must be at
least one greater than the highest azimuthal acoustic mode number
in order to effectively damp azimuthal oscillations [145]. While a
range of resonator locations effectively damped the oscillations, the
resonator efficacy is sensitive to the resonator volume.

Also shown in Fig. 13 are two circumferential baffles located
above and below the middle burner, labeled as “heat shields”. In
addition to their other functions, these shields serve as baffles for
high frequency radial modes. These baffles have an analogous
function to their usage for transverse rocket instabilities described
in Sec. 1.1. Radially-aligned baffles were examined by Dawson and
Worth [102], who showed that the addition of one or two baffles
had little influence on oscillation amplitudes, but forced the
acoustic mode to a standing-wave pattern, and eliminated traveling
waves and some of the more random switching in wave patterns
referred to in Sec. 3.1. Three or more baffles dampened the oscil-
lation amplitude.

Fuel staging and pilot fuel addition are also common passive
instability control techniques. This is a common technique for gas
turbine operators in can-combustion systems to suppress oscilla-
tions, although strategies for fuel staging must be customized for
each engine [7]. Fuel staging can also be used to break the sym-
metry of annular combustor configurations in an attempt to damp
azimuthal acoustic modes; this has been show theoretically
[120,141] and experimentally [3]. Additionally, pilot fuel may be
introduced to reduce oscillations. This strategy was described by
Solar Turbines for reduction of transverse oscillations [4], while GE
discussed how a fuel circuit that was originally intended to extend
lean blow-out limits has been used to reduce transverse combus-
tion instability [144]. However, fuel staging or the addition of pilot
fuel usually has adverse emissions impacts because of its change of
fuel/air distribution.

Siemens also presented various fuel nozzle design modifications
for alteration of instability characteristics in their annular frame
engines that had transverse oscillations [147]. A cylindrical burner
outlet (CBO) was used to push the flame axially downstream,
changing the convective time between fuel/air mixture injection
and the flame region, and moving the phase between the mixture

and heat release oscillations outside the positive Rayleigh index
band. Asymmetric burner outlets (ABO) were also employed to
alter the axial development of large-scale vortices. Symmetry
breaking with various levels of asymmetry in location of CBO's and
ABOs were also utilized.

Finally, active control techniques have been tested for the con-
trol of azimuthal modes. These techniques employ external exci-
tation, either acoustic forcing or pulsing of fuel or air delivery to the
combustor, to damp the self-excited mode [147,149e151,153,186].
These actuators can stabilize the system by pulsing either at the
forcing frequency with a phase-shift, or away from the forcing
frequency.

3. Acoustics

3.1. Transverse modes in circular geometries

This section summarizes transverse acoustic mode shapes and
frequencies of circular combustion chambers. We will quickly
summarize classical duct acoustic results, and refer the readers to
more detailed references for further discussion [17,187]. Transverse
modes in rectangular geometries are a straightforward general-
ization of one-dimensional axial modes (axial modes are denoted
with the index, n) to the transverse direction, and are not discussed
further. In circular geometries, the transverse motion can be asso-
ciated with radial modes (denoted by j) or azimuthal modes
(denoted by ma).4 A key distinction that azimuthal modes in cir-
cular geometries have from axial and/or transverse modes in
rectangular geometries, or the radial modes in circular geometries,
is the possibility of traveling waves in the azimuthal direction; in
contrast, standing waves are the only natural modes in rectangular
geometries.5 In axisymmetric systems, the direction of rotation of
these traveling waves is indeterminate and waves can exist that
rotate in one or both directions. Two counter-rotating waves of
equal amplitude lead to a standing wave transverse field. A key
distinction between a one-dimensional traveling and standing
acoustic wave is that the pressure and transverse velocity in a
traveling wave are in-phase with each other, as opposed to being
90(cid:3) offset in a standing wave. In problems where the unsteady heat
release rate is sensitive to the transverse velocity, the resulting
conditions under which the pressure and heat release rate are in

phase and, hence, the system is unstable, will be completely
different for traveling and standing waves. In most cases, however,
it appears that the heat release is more sensitive to the axial ve-
locity (see Sec. 3.2.1), whose characteristics are controlled by the
unsteady pressure and, thus, the heat release is “pressure-coupled”
to the transverse wave. In this situation, standing or traveling waves
result in the same pressure-heat release rate phase relationship.
Throughout this section, we utilize a linear acoustic framework
only, as acoustic amplitudes in air-breathing systems are often
sufficiently low that gas dynamic nonlinearities (e.g., shocks) are
negligible. However, incorporation of gas dynamic nonlinear pro-
cesses is often necessary in rocket applications [188e190].

In order to analyze basic features of the natural oscillations,
consider the annular combustor in Fig. 2. We assume a rigid walled
duct of outer radius, a2, so that ur,1(r 1⁄4 a2) 1⁄4 0. For annular geom-
etries, the same boundary condition applies at the inner radius,
ur,1(r 1⁄4 a1) 1⁄4 0 where a1 < a2. Annular geometries with “thin gaps”,
i.e., those where (a2 (cid:2) a1)/a1 ≪ 1, are the simplest to understand
and are considered first [79,111,112,191]. In this limit, the radial
dependence of
the azimuthal velocity is negligible, so the
azimuthal velocity is a function of the azimuthal and axial coordi-
nate, uq,1 1⁄4 uq,1(q,z). Neglecting any axial dependencies for the time
being (general expressions are presented in Appendix 1, Eq. (57)),
harmonic pressure and azimuthal velocity oscillations in this thin
gap limit are given by:

p1ðq;tÞ1⁄4 Realfexpð(cid:2)iutÞðC1 expðimaqÞþC2 expð(cid:2)imaqÞÞg

The natural frequency, fm, of purely azimuthal modes then
equals that of a one-dimensional duct with periodic boundary
conditions whose length equals the circumference of the gap,
Lq 1⁄4 2p(a1 þ a2)/2, and fm 1⁄4 mac0/Lq, where ma is an integer.

Similar simplifications apply for radial modes in the thin-gap
the radial velocity profile and pressur-
limit. Specifically,
eevelocity relationship for the first radial mode approach that of a
one-dimensional duct with rigid boundaries conditions, whose
rigiderigid duct length is equal to the gap width, (a2 (cid:2) a1) and
fj 1⁄4 (j (cid:2) 1)c0/2(a2 (cid:2) a1), where (j (cid:2) 1) is an integer for the radial
acoustic mode number.6 Fig. 14 plots the exact natural frequency of
a duct with no axial variations in the acoustic field, normalized by

4 However, “azimuthal modes” have a radial amplitude variation in general,

except in thin annular gaps where the radial dependence is negligible.

modes, it starts from one.

its thin gap value for the first two azimuthal modes and two radial
modes, showing that these approximations are quite accurate even
in situations where the annular gap is not thin at all.

We next consider circular geometries (i.e., a1 1⁄4 0). The first four

The two lowest frequency transverse modes, the “1T” and “2T”
or first and second tangential modes (referred to as azimuthal
modes in this paper), which correspond to the (ma,j) 1⁄4 (1,1) and
(ma,j) 1⁄4 (2,1) modes, and both have a q dependence. The third
frequency is the first radial mode, “1R”, i.e. (ma,j) 1⁄4 (0,2), which has
no q dependence. In the absence of mean flow in the azimuthal
direction, the natural frequency of the “1T” and “2T” “azimuthal”
modes are independent of whether the azimuthal mode is standing
or, if it is traveling or, on the azimuthal direction of rotation.

Operational experience has shown that azimuthal modes in air-
breathing combustors have a more complex time-varying depen-
dence than the purely harmonic oscillations shown in Eq. (9).
However this form is still a useful model for fitting real data, such as
by generalizing it to:

p1ðq;tÞ 1⁄4 ðC1ðtÞsinðut þmaqþw1ðtÞÞþC2ðtÞsinðut (cid:2)maqþw2ðtÞÞÞ
(11)

where C1ðtÞ and C2ðtÞ are the time varying amplitudes of waves
spinning in the clockwise and counterclockwise directions,
respectively, and w1(t) and w2(t) denote the associated time varying
phase. The pressure could also be equivalently written as:

p1ðq; tÞ 1⁄4C

sinðtÞsinðut þ wsinðtÞÞsinðmaqÞ
þ CcosðtÞsinðut þ wcosðtÞÞcosðmaqÞ

(12)

sinðtÞ and CcosðtÞ denote the time varying amplitude of
where C
azimuthal standing waves. Note that C1ðtÞ, C2ðtÞ and C
sinðtÞ, CcosðtÞ
are related using standard trigonometric relations. While these two
expressions are equivalent, they emphasize the traveling (spinning)
wave and standing wave character of the wave forms, respectively.
Moreover, if the amplitude coefficients in either expression are not
equal, then the wave form could be envisioned as a standing wave
with a rotating nodal pattern. For example, rotating standing waves
are observed that slowly “drift” in a somewhat stochastic manner
in either the clockwise or counter-clockwise direction, such as

described by Evesque et al. [111]. Whether the modes are standing
or spinning in the engine is important for two reasons. Standing
waves may align their nodal patterns at fixed locations in systems
with azimuthal non-uniformities, such as due to azimuthal fuel
staging or due to other geometric features. In such cases, if the
oscillation levels are being monitored with a single pressure sensor,
the azimuthal location of the sensor is unimportant if the mode is
spinning, while very important in cases where it is standing.
Similarly,
if resonators are to be employed for control, their
azimuthal location is critically important in how effective they are
in cases where the waves are standing.

Analysis of data from annular combustors shows standing,
spinning, and rotating standing wave fields [102,133]. For example,
experiments by Worth and Dawson showed that flame spacing,
nozzle swirl direction, and the placement of baffles influenced
which acoustic field structure dominated [101,102]. Fig. 15 shows an
example of these results, plotting the joint probability of the
clockwise and counter-clockwise spinning wave amplitudes for
two different swirler configurations and one baffled configuration.
The bivariate PDF (Probability Density Function) in Fig. 15(a) is
bimodal, indicating that the acoustic mode switches between a
standing pattern and a counter-clockwise spinning wave during the
experiment. In contrast, the mode is more likely to be standing
when the swirl direction is alternated between adjacent nozzles, as
shown in Fig. 15(b). However, the bivariate PDF of this standing
mode has significant spread due to the lack of azimuthal boundary
condition, indicating that the acoustic mode likely “drifts” in the
azimuthal direction during the experiment. When a baffle is
inserted in the combustor, the baffle boundary condition prevents
this drift and locks the standing mode into one location, as is shown
in Fig. 15(c). Here, the bivariate PDF is concentrated on the
standing-wave axis.

Similarly, results from other annular combustors have shown
both standing and traveling waves [105,106,110,114,133] and several
investigators have analyzed the reason for the preference of one
modal structure over another [108,119,121]. Schuermans et al. [121]
showed that although linear analysis of axial-velocity coupled
flames showed no preference for either type of disturbance,
nonlinear effects tended to favor traveling waves. Ghirardo and
Juniper [108] showed that the sensitivity of the flame to azimuthal
velocity fluctuations also plays an important role in determining
the standing/spinning nature of the mode e this sensitivity can be
understood from the discussion earlier in this section, where it was
noted that the pressure and transverse velocity are in phase for
traveling waves, and shifted ninety degrees relative to each other
for standing waves. In addition, Bauerheim et al. [78,134,135]
showed that even for flames that are only sensitive to axial

disturbances, a preference for standing/spinning waves can exist in
linear analyses when azimuthal mean flow and plenum acoustics
are also considered.

Noiray and Schuermans [119] showed that not only is the
acoustic mode dependent on the flame's sensitivity to the velocity
disturbance field, but also the noise level in the combustor. Fig. 16
shows a result from their analysis, similar to those from Fig. 15.
Here, the two amplitudes plotted on the axes are standing wave
amplitudes, as opposed to traveling amplitudes in Fig. 15.

However, these traveling/standing distinctions seem to become
ambiguous in the highly stochastic environments found in real
systems. Noiray and Schuermans [119] also noted that the broad
width of the wave amplitude PDF, as shown in Fig. 16, is associated
with intermittent switching between traveling and standing wave
motions. This can be seen by comparing the PDF of spinning wave
amplitudes (Eq. (11)) and standing wave amplitudes (Eq. (12)), and
noting that both seem equally reasonable representations of data at
high disturbance amplitudes. They introduced a stochastic model
with a tunable additive noise parameter, showing this effect.

To summarize these studies, the relative preference for standing
or traveling disturbances is influenced by the linear flame sensi-
tivity to flow disturbances, nonlinear effects, mean azimuthal flow
effects, geometry effects (such as plenum), and noise effects.

3.2. Multi-dimensional and boundary condition effects

The prior section summarized key results for classical duct
acoustics where the wave field could be reduced to a one- or two-
dimensional problem, and the axial distribution of the wave field
was not considered. However, combustors intrinsically involve
more complex geometries and boundary conditions, as well as non-
uniform temperature fields. We consider three important problems

in this section e multi-dimensional geometry effects, effects of an
axial temperature gradient, and effects of an impedance boundary
condition on azimuthal modes.

3.2.1. Multi-dimensional geometry effects e injector coupling

This section introduces multi-dimensional effects in combustors
where the acoustic field is dominated by transverse modes. This
discussion is particularly focused around annular geometries,
although it also has relevance to can-combustors. Specifically,
having discussed the basic acoustic features of annular and circular
geometries, we next consider the additional effects associated with
transverse wave motion interaction with the inflow nozzles, an
example of which is shown in Fig. 17. In order to motivate the key
questions considered in this section, refer to the annular combustor

combustor, where x 1⁄4 Rq.

or transverse forcing rig sketched in Figs. 2 or 7, showing an annular
ring around which nozzles are placed. These nozzles could be sit-
uated at any point in the standing wave field. For example, Fig. 18
shows a nozzle situated near the velocity node and another near
the pressure node, which experience significantly different
disturbance fields and flame excitation physics. Moreover, these
disturbance wavelengths could be quite long relative to the nozzle
dimension in the case of annular modes, or on the same order of the
wavelength for radial modes.

As will be shown in Sec. 5, several paths exist by which a
transverse mode may excite a flame [85,126,193,194]. In particular,
transverse modes directly excite the flame, they excite hydrody-
namic flow instabilities, and they also lead to axial acoustic flow
oscillations in the nozzle. It is these axial acoustic flow oscillations
that are the focus of this section. Axial acoustic oscillations are a
wave diffraction effect, as the dominantly transverse mode leads to
an oscillatory pressure field across the nozzle.

We begin this section by highlighting some of the purely
acoustic aspects of this problem for cases where the nozzle
diameter is small relative to an acoustic wavelength. We closely
follow Blimbaum et al. [192], which presented three-dimensional
acoustic simulations of a geometry similar to Fig. 17. This geom-
etry consists of a high aspect ratio combustor, simulating an
“unwrapped” annulus, connecting into an annular nozzle (such as
in Fig. 8(a)). An important limiting case is where the nozzle cross-
sectional area is small relative to the radial-axial cross-sectional
area cut of the annulus, Acs;s=Acs;A≪1, as also discussed in the
context of Fig. 2. In this case, the azimuthal distribution of volume
flow rate oscillations induced by transverse acoustic disturbances
are only weakly influenced by the nozzle itself. In this limit the
pressure and axial velocity at the nozzle outlet are controlled by
the general waveform of the disturbance in the absence of the
nozzle, i.e., the location of the nozzle with respect to global ve-
locity or pressure nodes. Blimbaum et al. [192] demonstrated this
by comparing three different azimuthal acoustic field scenarios:
“pressure anti-node”, “pressure node”, and “traveling wave” sce-
narios. The first two disturbance fields lead to standing wave fields
in the system, where the nozzle outlet centerline is nominally

located at a pressure anti-node and node, respectively. The ve-
locity field exhibits a node and antinode, respectively. In the
traveling wave forcing scenario, an anechoic boundary is applied
to one side of the domain. In the absence of the nozzle, the
acoustic field is one-dimensional.

The pressure anti-node case generates zero transverse velocity
at the nozzle outlet centerline, but large pressure fluctuations are
present that are symmetric across the nozzle centerline. These
pressure fluctuations lead to nearly axisymmetric, axial velocity
disturbances. The nozzle response for this symmetric forcing case
can be understood from quasi one-dimensional concepts.
In
contrast, the pressure node case exhibits large transverse velocity
fluctuations in the center of the combustor. Because of the
centerline pressure node, the pressure fluctuations have a 180(cid:3)
phase difference on the two sides of the nozzle centerline. This
tends to drive axial velocity fluctuations that are phased approxi-
mately 180(cid:3) apart on the left and right sides of the nozzle (but
smaller in amplitude as the pressure fluctuations are small if the
nozzle is acoustically compact). This nozzle response is intrinsically
three-dimensional. Both cases are illustrated in Fig. 18. The trav-
eling wave case shows an intermediate behavior (since a traveling
wave is the superposition of two standing waves).

The nozzle impedance has a significant effect on this transverse
to axial coupling for pressure anti-node and traveling wave acoustic
excitation. In order to understand this point, assume that the nozzle
impedance is given by bZ o at the lower end of the nozzle section,
z 1⁄4 (cid:2)h, as shown in Fig. 17. This nozzle impedance, bZ o, is associated
with all of the acoustic properties of the flow passages, swirlers,
and compressor discharge plenum, upstream of this point [124]
(Note however, that it may not be possible to specify an imped-
ance boundary condition of this form in cases where transverse
motions are excited in the upstream plenum). As long as the fre-
quency lies below the cutoff frequency of the inflow nozzle, the
acoustic field quickly reverts to one-dimensional, as transverse
disturbances are evanescent. A one-dimensional field leads to a
powerful simplification, as the relationship between the axial ve-
locity and pressure in the nozzle at all other axial locations are
uniquely related through the impedance translation theorem [195]:

Fig. 19(a) provides an example of a case where the quasi 1-D
approximation is quite accurate by showing the magnitude of the
pressure fluctuation amplitude along a transverse line in the center
plane (y 1⁄4 0) for a bZ tr=r
0c0 1⁄4 1 case where the side-branch acous-
tics do not significantly impact the acoustics of the annulus. For
reference, the solid curve denotes the value of the disturbance field
that would exist in the absence of the nozzle. Here, the nozzle
causes only a slight distortion of the disturbance field. In this case,
Eq. (14) can be applied by using the acoustic pressure calculated in
the absence of the nozzle.

In contrast, the nozzle significantly distorts the pressure field
0c0≪1.
from the 1-D result when either Acs,s/Acs,A is not small or bZ tr=r
These two conditions are particularly important in the pressure anti-
node and traveling wave cases, as shown in Fig. 19(b), because the
transverse mode pressure fluctuation in the region of the nozzle is
significant. Little distortion occurs for the pressure node case where
the nominal pressure fluctuation is zero. When the combustor
acoustic field exhibits a significantly non-zero pressure near the
nozzle, note how the low nozzle impedance “pulls” the pressure
amplitude toward zero. In this case, the acoustic pressure fluctuation
is significantly altered by the presence of the nozzle and cannot be
calculated from a decoupled calculation. Further away from the nozzle
in the transverse direction, the calculations that do and do not account
for the presence of the side-branch converge for both the pressure
anti-node and pressure node cases.

This transverse to axial flow coupling process has been highlighted
in a number of studies. Staffelbach et al. [74] presented LES results from
an annular combustor, clearly showing the presence of strong axial
pulsations in nozzle flow accompanying transverse oscillations. This
study suggested that it was these axial flow pulsations that dominated
the flame response. In other words, the transverse flow oscillations
serve as the “clock” that controls the natural frequency of the wave
motions and the structure of the wave field, but it is the induced axial
fluctuations that actually excite the heat release oscillations that, in
turn, excite the transverse modes. Experimental observations of this
same point were also made by O'Connor and Lieuwen [85], who
presented a number of transversely excited flame results, see Fig. 20.
Fig. 20(a) shows an asymmetrically forced case, where the nozzle is
located at a pressure node and experiences significant transverse flow
oscillations, and a relatively weak unsteady pressure field. Closer to
the nozzle, however, an axial asymmetric breathing in and out of the
nozzle cavity in the axial direction can be seen. This asymmetric
forcing leads to the excitation of strong helical shear layer modes [192].
Fig. 20(b) shows the symmetric forcing case, where the nozzle is at a
pressure anti-node and acoustic velocity node. Near the nozzle, sig-
nificant axisymmetric vortical velocity fluctuations are excited by bulk
axial velocity fluctuations in and out of the nozzle, because of the large
pressure oscillations. This leads to the strong excitation of axisym-
metric shear layer modes. Instantaneous images of the flame are also
indicated in Fig. 20(c) and (d), showing the asymmetric and symmetric
wrinkling of flames situated at pressure nodes and anti-nodes,
respectively, as a result of the dominantly helical and axisymmetric
shear layer modes that are excited by the forcing.

Similar flame fluctuations were seen in an annular configuration
by Worth and Dawson [100,161]. Fig. 21 shows two results during

uration, flames are not only subjected to purely symmetric (pressure
anti-node) and asymmetric (velocity anti-node) disturbances, but also
a range of asymmetric acoustic disturbance fields in between those
nodes. The fluctuating flame response at these points around the
annulus is evident in Fig. 21(a) and (b), which shows the normalized
fluctuating heat release rate, measured with OH* chemiluminescence,
at two places around the annulus at one phase of the acoustic cycle.

In other words, for transverse mode frequencies that are much
lower than nozzle cutoff frequencies, it is not the nozzle imped-
ance, bZ 0, or nozzle length, h, parameters that are individually
important, but their net translated impedance, bZ tr at the nozzle
outlet. We consider three important limits for bZ trðz 1⁄4 0Þ: pressure
release (bZ tr=r
0c0 1⁄4 1), and rigid boundary
conditions (bZ tr=r
0c0[1), leading to a matrix of 3 (cid:5) 3 different
scenarios which are summarized in Table 2 and discussed further
next [192].

0c0≪1), anechoic (bZ tr=r

In this table, “pressure-coupled” means that the axial acoustic
velocity and pressure at the nozzle outlet are related through the
translated impedance, bZ tr, in the D=l≪1 limit. In this case, the
nozzle outlet axial velocity is approximately given by:

In contrast, the “Not pressure coupled” results mean that the
pressure and axial velocity are not related in this simple way.
Although the axial velocity fluctuations at the nozzle outlet may be
non-negligible in this out of phase case, they are of opposite phases
on the opposite sides of the nozzle and cancel each other, leading to
a progressive decay in disturbance amplitude and fluctuation en-
ergy in the nozzle. For this reason, the nozzle impedance has no
influence on the disturbance field characteristics in the pressure
node case. This result has important implications for radial modes
in an annular combustor where nozzles located along the radial
centerline are located at a velocity anti-node/pressure node.

Returning to the table, “Quasi 1-D” means that the pressure
fluctuations from the azimuthal mode at the nozzle outlet is
controlled by the “bulk” acoustics of the combustor; i.e., they can be
calculated to close approximation without accounting for the
presence of the nozzles. In contrast, “not Quasi 1-D” means that the
side branch (i.e., the nozzle) materially alters the acoustic field
structure at the nozzle outlet.

same direction as the wave propagation, and so the problem re-
mains nominally one-dimensional. Natural frequencies are, to first
approximation, reasonably approximated by simple time of travel
arguments, i.e., scaling as f (cid:6) 1=ð2 R dz=cðzÞÞ for rigid boundary
conditions, where c(z) is the spatially varying speed of sound. In
contrast, axial temperature gradients increase the dimensionality
of transverse acoustic problems and modify the basic natural fre-
quency considerations described in Sec. 3.1. In this case, the natural
frequency of the system is controlled by a weighted coupling of the
transverse modes in the high and low temperature/sound speed
regions of the duct.

In order to illustrate how natural transverse frequencies are
affected by axial temperature gradients, consider a model problem
of transverse modes in a thin annular duct shown in Fig. 22,
neglecting fluctuations in heat release [127]. The duct is of radius R,
where R 1⁄4 (a1 þ a2)/2 and length, L, with an abrupt temperature
discontinuity at z 1⁄4 Li. This is a commonly used approximation for
the temperature field in a combustor where the flame is acousti-
cally compact [79,122,124]. Further, the axial flow is assumed to be
of low Mach number axial flow, i.e. M≪1. The expressions used for
the results discussed next are presented in Appendix 1, and the rest
of this section presents results from this model problem. These
calculations assume that the z 1⁄4 0 boundary is acoustically rigid
and consider both rigid and pressure release boundary conditions
at z 1⁄4 L.

Fig. 23 shows the dependence of the normalized frequency on the
azimuthal modes with L/R 1⁄4 0.5 (typical values for real hardware
range from ~0.5 to 2), as a function of the temperature jump location,
b 1⁄4 Li/L, for different temperature ratios, k 1⁄4 Tb,0/Tu,0. The natural
frequencies are normalized by reference frequencies based upon
weighted average temperatures that are defined in Appendix 1. A
few important observations follow from these results. First, the re-
sults are reasonably captured by the reference frequency calculation
based upon average temperatures, although the degree of agree-
ment between the two is a strong function of other parameters. The
parameter L/R quantifies finite axial-length effects and, although not
shown, the transverse results asymptote to the reference frequency
in the limit of L/R / ∞. This result shows that a weighted temper-
ature approximation is a useful approximation for axial temperature
variation effects. This leads to the second observation, which is that
finite length effects are more important in the pressure release case.
This boundary condition causes significantly more alteration of the
axial wave distribution than the rigid condition, due to it forcing the
unsteady pressure to zero at z 1⁄4 L. This is prominently manifested in
the fact that no purely azimuthal mode is present with a pressure

on the inner flame branch with an arrow to highlight the sym-
metric response of the flame. Flame response at the velocity anti-
node, in Fig. 21(d), clearly shows asymmetric flame response with
helical flame wrinkling in both branches of the flame.

Saurabh et al. [99] also presented measurements of the response
of the flame to traveling waves, showing that the flame response is
similar to the flame response at the pressure anti-node in the
standing wave case. In a linear framework, this result can be un-
derstood by noting that a traveling wave is the complex super-
two standing waves with a 90(cid:3) phase shift:
position of
exp(ikx) 1⁄4 cos(kx) þ isin(kx). As will be discussed in Sec. 5, the global
flame response of axisymmetric flames to fluctuations at the
pressure node is negligible (although the transverse to longitudinal
acoustic coupling at the pressure anti-node can drive significant
global heat release rate fluctuations). This would indicate that
flame response to traveling wave disturbances would resemble
flame response at a pressure anti-node.

3.2.2. Axial temperature inhomogeneity effects

In this section, we consider the effects of temperature in-
homogeneity on transverse mode characteristics. We particularly
focus on the case of temperature gradients in the axial direction, a
situation that is very appropriate for combustor environments. For
longitudinal problems, these axial temperature variations are in the

release boundary condition. Rather, the first azimuthal mode is a
mixed axial-azimuthal mode. This is responsible for the jump in
frequencies in Fig. 23 between the rigid and pressure release
boundary condition cases. This also shows that a purely transverse
mode which might be encountered in a real engine with a choked
nozzle, cannot be emulated in open ended combustor, even a full
annular combustor.

3.2.3. Non-ideal boundary condition effects

The prior section presented an example with “perfect” boundary
conditions, where the combustor inlet and outlet were rigid or pres-
sure release. In real systems, while such a boundary condition might
be a useful first approximation, there are always losses at boundaries.
In this section, we consider the effect of a “nearly-rigid” and a “nearly-
pressure release” boundary condition on transverse oscillations.

The “nearly-rigid” boundary condition is an important problem
in low Mach number combustors with choked nozzles. The choked
nozzle boundary condition has been the subject of an extensive
literature for rocket applications [51,66,68,196e198]. An important
follow-on to this work for axial disturbances and compact nozzles
was given by Marble and Candel [199,200], who presented a gen-
eral set of results for acoustic and entropy disturbance interactions
with nozzles. While the reader is referred to these references for
details, the basic considerations leading to the choked nozzle
boundary condition are quite straightforward in cases where the
incident disturbance wavelength is long relative to the nozzle itself.
In this case, there is negligible mass accumulation in the nozzle, so
that the mass flow rate into the nozzle (referred to here as station
X), and the mass flow rate at the choke point are the same at each
instant of time.7 Assuming isentropic fluctuations, this equation
leads to the following linearized boundary condition at station X:

Equation (15) relates the pressure fluctuations to the axial flow
fluctuations at the nozzle entrance point for a one dimensional
problem. This equation shows that choked nozzles in low Mach
number flows behave like acoustically rigid boundaries, as
bZ out=r

0c0[1.

Consider now the effect of the outlet nozzle on transverse
waves. Similar reasoning suggests that pressure fluctuations pre-
sent in transverse modes also lead to a mass flow modulation
through the nozzle and, therefore, an indirectly induced axial flow
disturbance. Stow et al. [79] showed that this same Eq. (15) can be
applied to azimuthal waves in a thin gapped annulus. This implies
that a transverse mode, with some azimuthal distribution of fluc-
tuating pressure, induces an axial flow disturbance at the nozzle
outlet. Similar to the discussion in Sec. 3.2.2, this leads to an axial
distribution of the transverse mode amplitude and phase.

Consider open ended pipes next. In cases where the acoustic
wavelength is small relative to the duct radius for circular pipes, i.e.,
R=l≪1 or kR≪1, the outlet impedance for axial disturbances has
been derived as an expansion in powers of kR, with the pressure
release boundary condition (i.e. p1 1⁄4 0) emerging as the leading order
term [201]. While it is not clear whether this boundary condition
requires modification for the transverse problem, it seems clear that
the impedance will be similarly near zero for a pipe/annulus whose
diameter/gap is small relative to the acoustic wavelength. For axial
disturbances, the first order correction to approximating an open
ended duct as pressure release is purely imaginary, leading to the
“end correction” for the effective length of the duct, while the second
order term is real, describing sound radiation (damping) from the
duct. These expressions are presented in Appendix 2.

We next illustrate quantitative results by considering finite end
impedance effects. The characteristic equation for this analysis is
shown in Eq. (61) of Appendix 1. In order to maximize simplicity in
expressions, we will assume uniform temperature. In this case the
natural modes of the duct are described by the characteristic equation:

transverse or pure axial mode. Thus, the spatial correction is far
more significant for the purely transverse mode. However, the
outlet impedance scaling of the eigenfrequency, HeR, takes a
different form. From Eq. (58) we can expand to obtain:

acoustic losses at the nozzle. The axial and temporal decays can be
seen explicitly by writing out the full expressions for the pressure:

Note the purely imaginary part of the correction, showing that
the nonzero impedance effect leads to acoustic damping, but no
frequency shift. An important feature of this result is the fact that
the damping is a function of both the axial and azimuthal mode

numbers. As also discussed in Sec. 3.1, note also that there is no pure
(n,ma) 1⁄4 (0,1) azimuthal mode in this case, since that would lead to
a trivial solution for the pressure when enforcing the nearly pres-
sure release outflow boundary condition. This shows that an open
ended annular configuration cannot simulate the purely transverse
mode that is present in combustors with choked boundary
conditions.

4. Hydrodynamic instabilities

Although combustion driven oscillations are usually associ-
ated with natural acoustic frequencies that serve as the “clock”
for the system frequency, the dominant source of disturbances
that actually lead to heat release rate oscillations are often
vortical flow disturbances. These large scale vortical distur-
bances themselves arise from concentration of the vorticity that
largely originates from boundary layers in approach flow pas-
sages or other walls. For example, the separating free shear layer
is linearly unstable due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, and
amplifies the perturbations introduced by the acoustic distur-
bances. At finite amplitude, these shear layer perturbations
saturate into vortical structures composed of concentrated re-
gions of vorticity [202]. The KelvineHelmholtz instability is
present in flows with axial and azimuthal shear, while centrif-
ugal mechanisms are also at play in swirling flows. These in-
also influenced strongly by
stabilities
the density
inhomogenities in combusting flows, which both modify how
vorticity induces motion on other regions through vorticity
dilation processes, as well as the local vorticity through baro-
clinic mechanisms.

are

These large scale structures are embedded upon a background
of broadband, smaller scale turbulence. A number of studies have
used the time averaged velocity profile as inputs to laminar flow
stability analyses to make predictions about flow stability behavior
e such as linear disturbance amplification rates, nonlinear satura-
tion, and disturbance frequencies [203e205]. This “quasi-laminar”
approach is taken in this section as well, but we should caution that
a number of questions remain around the bounds of applicability of
such analyses.

In order to fix some notation, we consider problems in both a
rectangular and polar coordinate system. For nominally two-
dimensional geometries, we decompose the velocity field into

Note that we use mh to denote hydrodynamic azimuthal mode
numbers, in order to differentiate from the ma index used for
azimuthal acoustic modes, since both disturbances will be simul-
taneously present. In a polar coordinate system, the mh 1⁄4 0 modes
describe axisymmetric disturbances and mh s 0 modes describe
helical disturbances. The sign of mh, i.e., mh < 0 and mh > 0, denote
counter-clockwise and clockwise modes, respectively.9 The pres-
ence of two modes with equal amplitudes and opposite signed mh
values denotes a “standing” wave disturbance in the azimuthal
direction. A sketch of these modes in a jet is in Fig. 24.

The response of the flow to external forcing can be decomposed
into two sub-problems, which are the focus of the following two
sub-sections: (1) the flow response to a given disturbance, such as
the spatial growth rate for an unstable mode, and (2) the excitation
strength of the flow forcing, which is related to the initial condition.
In a linear framework, each spatial mode of the flow disturbance
can be expressed as:

where the excitation frequency, u, is a real number. The wave-
number for helical mode mh is denoted by kh,m and is complex, so
the first sub-problem above is associated with its imaginary part,
which describes the spatial growth rate of a disturbance. For
example, a round jet amplifies disturbances that are both axisym-
metric (mh 1⁄4 0) and helical (mh s 0) in nature, and the response of
the same jet can differ markedly depending upon which of these
modes are excited by the flow. This point will be discussed exten-
sively in Sec. 5, where we show different flame response features,
depending upon different acoustic forcing configurations e these
different flame response features can be traced directly back to
which instability modes are excited. The response of the flow to
forcing is discussed first, followed by a treatment of which modes
are preferentially excited by transverse forcing

9 This can be understood by considering the phase function of the disturbance at
a fixed time defined as (kh,mz þ mh4), where z is the axial flow direction and 4
increases in the counter-clockwise direction. Hence, a positive mode (þmh) has a
line of constant phase with a sense of winding in the opposite direction to 4.
Conversely, a negative mode ((cid:2)mh) is co-rotating with 4.

wake flow to be globally stable, so that the unsteady flow structures
are dominated by the convectively unstable shear layers [213e215].
Many flowfields of interest also contain swirl, and the ratio of
the reference azimuthal to axial velocity, S, has profound influences
on the flow structure. Reacting swirl flow reviews are provided by
Syred [216] and Candel et al. [25] so we only summarize several key
dynamical features. One of the most prominent features of high
swirl number flows is the occurrence of “vortex breakdown,” which
is manifested as a stagnation point in the flow followed by a region
of reverse flow [217]. The outer flow not entrained into the recir-
culating bubble accelerates around it. Typically, the flow does not
instantaneously rotate about the geometric centerline. Rather, the
point of zero azimuthal velocity is located off-center and this point
itself rotates about the geometric center. This location of zero
azimuthal velocity is referred to as the precessing vortex core (PVC)
[218]. This global mode interacts strongly with the separating shear
layers, generally causing them to rollup at the same frequency as
that of the global mode. However, when forced, the convectively
unstable shear layers generally respond at the forcing frequency,
resulting in the periodic formation of vortices in the shear layers
that convect downstream with the mean flow. However, the central
vortex breakdown region structure is altered only at high forcing
levels, consistent with its globally unstable nature [86]. Swirl cau-
ses important influences on spatial growth rates of shear layer
disturbances. In particular, it biases the strength of co- and counter-
winding helical vortices, so that positive and negative mode
numbers do not have the same growth rate.

Fig. 25 shows an example of a linear spatial growth rate calcu-
lation, plotting the exponential growth rate, i.e., the imaginary part
of kh,m, of several modes as a function of excitation frequency for a
swirling jet. The different growth rates of the mh 1⁄4 (cid:2)1 and mh 1⁄4 þ1
modes are due to the presence of swirl. Note how the growth rate is
a strong function of both frequency and which spatial mode is being
considered.

4.2. Excitation features of transversely forced flows

As shown above, a given flow has multiple unstable modes that
have different spatial mode shapes. Thus, not only the frequency,
but also the spatial dependence of the forcing strongly influences
the response of the flow. This controls the initial amplitude of the
disturbance, the second sub-problem described above Eq. (30).

During longitudinal acoustic instabilities, the acoustic field
provides a strong symmetric forcing of the flow field e thus, it
preferentially excites the varicose (s 1⁄4 1) and axisymmetric

tems with respect to the center of the nozzle.

4.1. Forced response of hydrodynamically unstable flows

A hydrodynamically unstable flow can exhibit different types of
response to forcing. To understand these differences, it is useful to
recall some definitions of spatial and temporal instability, as well as
the concepts of convective and global
instability [192,207]. A
“convectively unstable” flow region acts as an amplifier, so that
disturbances created at some point grow in amplitude as they
convect out of the system. The growth rate of these disturbances is
a function of frequency and mean flow properties, such as shear
layer thickness. However, the oscillations are not self-excited, but
require a continuous disturbance source to persist. During com-
bustion instabilities, acoustic forcing at narrowband frequencies
provides a strong excitation source to these spatially growing dis-
turbances; a good example of this was shown in Fig. 4.

A globally unstable flow acts as an oscillator e it is self-excited
and does not require external disturbances to persist. In such a
self-excited system, the amplitude grows before saturating into a
limit cycle oscillation [208]. Moreover, the spectrum of oscillations
shows a narrowband peak associated with this natural global mode
frequency. When externally forced at another frequency, the limit
cycle behavior can co-exist with the externally forced oscillations at
low forcing amplitudes, and nonlinearly interact with the forcing at
high forcing amplitude. For example, “lock-in” refers to a phe-
nomenon where oscillations at the global mode frequency disap-
pear altogether with sufficient external forcing amplitude at some
other frequency.

Constant density, non-swirling round jets are globally stable but
convectively unstable. For example, in non-swirling jets, Michalke's
calculations suggest that the symmetric mh 1⁄4 0 mode and the first
helical mode, mh 1⁄4 ±1, should have the largest growth rates near
the jet exit [209,210], although higher order modes are also un-
stable. However, the relative growth rates of these different modes
are a sensitive function of the jet shear layer thickness relative to
the jet radius. For example, the mh 1⁄4 0 and ±1 modes have com-
parable maximum growth rates for thinner boundary layer profiles.
Inviscid, constant density two-dimensional wakes are globally
unstable, with the dominant mode being the sinuous one, mani-
festing itself as the Von Karman vortex street. Axisymmetric wakes
are also globally unstable, with the first helical mode, mh 1⁄4 ±1,
having the largest temporal growth rate [211,212]. However, the
strong density gradients introduced by combustion of sufficient gas
expansion ratio between reactants and products often causes the

(mh 1⁄4 0) mode in the two-dimensional and axisymmetric cases,
respectively. In contrast, transverse oscillations generally excite
non-symmetric modes. To illustrate, consider the decomposition of
a disturbance into transverse modes, using the coordinate system
shown in Fig. 26. Note that the polar coordinate system used here
(polar angle is 4) is centered on a given nozzle, and is different from
the azimuthal coordinate system (azimuthal angle q) used for the
entire annular combustor (such as in Fig. 22).

Consider first a one-dimensional acoustic disturbance of the
form exp(ikx), such as might be encountered in an annular
combustor. A traveling wave eikx (or, if considering waves in an
annular combustion chamber, the traveling wave is given by eikRq)
can be equivalently decomposed as:

and Jmh denotes the Bessel function of the first kind. This expression
shows that a single traveling wave in the x direction in the rect-
angular coordinate system can be written as a superposition of an
infinite sum of helical disturbances in the polar coordinate system
e it thus shows which helical disturbances are most strongly
excited by such a traveling wave. The results for the modal ampli-
tude strengths, bC mh , for the asymmetric and symmetric forcing can
similarly be derived and are shown in Table 3.

In many problems of interest, the nozzle/flame region is small
relative to an acoustic wavelength, so kr≪1. Expanding the Bessel
functions in a Taylor series and retaining only the leading order
term leads to a result that is more easily interpretable and is also
shown in the table. These results can be summarized in three key
points. First, traveling waves most strongly excite the mh 1⁄4 0
modes, but also other even and odd modes. Next, symmetric forc-
ing most strongly excites the axisymmetric, mh 1⁄4 0 mode, and does

not excite odd modes. Finally, asymmetric forcing most strongly
excites the mh 1⁄4 ±1 modes, and does not excite even modes.

Note in all cases how the amplitude of higher modes drops off
quickly in the kr ≪ 1 case. The dependence of these coefficients
upon mode number are plotted in Fig. 27(a) and (b), which can be
thought of as a plot of the strength of the forcing of the different
hydrodynamic modes of the flow. It can be hypothesized that hy-
drodynamic modes that are more strongly forced by the acoustic
field will manifest themselves with higher responses. While the
relative sensitivities of the hydrodynamic modes to excitation also
comes into play as described in Sec. 2.1, this hypothesis is generally
the case as illustrated in Fig. 27(c) and (d), which plots measured
velocity fluctuation amplitudes from O'Connor and Lieuwen [86] e
these are the hydrodynamic responses to acoustic forcing. Note the
very close correspondence of the dominant measured modes, to
those that the decomposition shows to be excited by the method of
forcing. The one noticeable difference between the experimental
results and the analytical symmetric and asymmetric prediction is
the strong response at mh 1⁄4 (cid:2)2 in the experimental symmetric
forcing case. This is likely a result of hydrodynamic amplification of
this mode as a result of the natural instability characteristics of this
flow field; measurements of the unforced flow have shown that
mh 1⁄4 (cid:2)2 is a preferred mode [86]. This result clearly shows how
both predictions and measurements bear out the influence of the
excitation field structure on the dominant hydrodynamic response.
These results complement those shown in Fig. 20, and illustrate the
fundamental difference that nozzle placement in an acoustic
standing wave field plays out in terms of excited hydrodynamic
disturbances.

4.3. Transverse forcing of typical combustor flowfields

With this background, the rest of this section reviews studies
that have analyzed the forced response of flows to transverse (or
non-axisymmetric) forcing. Studies of shear layer instability and
forced response include forcing the flow from the upstream
plenum [219,220], by mechanical actuation [221,222], or trans-
versely deflecting the shear layer [223e229]. For example, Fiedler
and Mensing [228] forced the shear layer transversely by exciting a
waveguide that opened at a slit at the separation point of the
mixing layer. The authors noted that a key distinction from bulk-
flow forcing was that the boundary layer is periodically “deflec-
ted” by the transverse mass flow fluctuation at the slit. A theoretical
effort by Tam [229] explored the role of an incident sound wave's
angle of incidence relative to the shear layer, showing that an angle
between 500 and 800 was the most effective at driving the shear
layer instability. The efficacy of the forced response was also found
to be a function of the acoustic beam half-width, the acoustic fre-
quency, the shear layer thickness, and the Mach number of the flow.

Studies of the transverse forcing of wakes typically fall into two
categories: those looking at the re-attachment of wakes on bluff-
bodies [230e232], and the control of wakes of airfoils [233e237].
Re-attachment studies often use slits at the shear layer separation
point, similar to Fiedler and Mensing [228], to control shear layer
development. The free-stream forcing of airfoil wakes indicates
that transverse forcing of the wake or a separation region can
significantly reduce the size of the separation bubble, as well as the
intensity and size of coherent structures shedding from the back of
the airfoil.

A number of studies have investigated the response of jets to
transverse forcing. Some of these studies focus on shear layer
control and use excitation at the separation point [238e245], me-
chanical actuation [243,246e248], or transverse excitation of the
free stream by both standing waves [249] and traveling waves
[232,250e252]. Experiments show that control of the shear layer
structures, jet turbulence levels, and jet spreading rate is readily
achievable with non-axisymmetric forcing. For example, Kusek
et al. [245] used twelve speakers located around the jet exit to
excite azimuthal modes in the circular jet. Fig. 28 shows an example
of the smoke visualization from this experiment, illustrating the
considerable effect that non-axisymmetric forcing can have on flow
response. In Fig. 28(a), a symmetric forcing function is imposed on
the convectively unstable jet, resulting in a symmetric response,
whereas in Fig. 28(b), an asymmetric forcing function drives an
asymmetric response from the jet. An extreme example of the ef-
fects of non-axisymmetric response of jets is in the case of bifur-
cating and blooming jets [253].

transverse

Finally, a growing number of studies have investigated the
forcing on swirling flows
impact of
[85,86,254e256]. Studies used acoustic forcing at the jet separation
point [254e256], and in the cases of Gallaire et al. [255] and Panda
and McLaughlin [256], the azimuthal distribution of the forcing was
controlled, as in Kusek et al. [245]. Similar results to those from
Kusek et al. [245] were found in the swirling flow studies, indi-
cating that the response of the convectively unstable shear layers
mirrored the symmetry of the input forcing function. Work by
O'Connor and Lieuwen [87] corroborated these shear layer results
in the jet near-field, but also showed a growth in the mh 1⁄4 (cid:2)1 mode
as a function of downstream distance, even when the external
forcing function was symmetric; this is believed to be a result of the
natural
instability characteristics of the jet shear layer being
superimposed on the shear layer response to the forcing function.
Results from Gursul [254] and O'Connor and Lieuwen [86] showed
that the vortex breakdown region of the flow field, which stems
from a global instability, responds very differently to transverse
excitation than the shear layers. Gursul observed “lock-in” of the
helical instability in the vortex breakdown region downstream of
the jet exit, while O'Connor and Lieuwen did not observe any

dynamical response of the PVC to transverse forcing. However,
O'Connor and Lieuwen did observe a large-scale bifurcation in the
vortex breakdown structure at high amplitudes of forcing, some-
what similar to the “blooming jet” phenomenon observed in
asymmetrically forced jets.

interfacial

In two phase flows, transverse acoustic forcing of liquid jets
[257e259], supercritical jets [58,59,62,63,260e263], and droplets
in-
[264,265] has shown that the development of
stabilities can be significantly altered by transverse acoustic fields.
In liquid jets, the transverse forcing acts to displace the liquid jet
and changes the jet breakup characteristics at a range of Weber
numbers [257]. This problem has been studied extensively in rocket
applications, where transverse oscillations are the dominant form
of combustion instability. For example, imaging by Talley and co-
workers [58,59,260] of transversely forced sub- and supercritical
jets has shown that the acoustic field periodically displaces the jet,
and can change the time-average spreading rate of the jet, and
hence its entrainment rate. An example of these results is shown in
Fig. 29, where a subcritical co-axial jet is subjected to transverse
acoustic forcing [266]. In each of the images, the phase angle in the
top-right of the image indicates the phase between the speakers on
either end of the forcing facility. “0(cid:3)” leads to a pressure anti-node

at the jet, where “180(cid:3)” creates a pressure node. Comparison of the
response of the liquid jet at each forcing condition with the “no
acoustics” case shows a number of the ways that transverse
acoustics impacts liquid jet breakup. First, there is significant lateral
displacement of the jet, particularly near the “180(cid:3),” or velocity
anti-node, case where local velocity fluctuations drive large-scale
motion of the jet core. As a result of this, the jet spreading angle
near the velocity anti-node/pressure node is much greater. Finally,
acoustic driving also changes the length of the “dark core,” or the
continuous liquid core of the jet, accelerating atomization.

In addition, the induced axial air flow fluctuations described in
Sec. 3.2.1 also influence the spray. Studies of axial forcing of non-
reacting sprays into an atmospheric pressure ambient have shown
that atomization and spray spreading characteristics are modulated
[267e269]. For example, Eckstein et al. [267] concluded that the
instantaneous Sauter mean diameter was modulated by axial
forcing, but in a quasi-steady manner. In other words, utilizing the
instantaneous air flow velocity in steady state droplet sizing cor-
relations captured the instantaneous droplets sizes. In addition, the
spray cone angle can be modulated by forcing, such as through
modulation of the flow swirl number [268].

5. Flame response

This section discusses more fully the sensitivity of the flame to
transverse instabilities. Starting with transverse flow and pressure
disturbances as the input, and heat release oscillations as the
output, there are multiple pathways through which heat release
oscillations are excited, as shown in Fig. 30. The flame is dominantly
sensitive to flow disturbances (referred to as “velocity coupling”),
as well as any fuel/air ratio oscillations excited by these distur-
bances (“fuel/air ratio coupling”), while its direct sensitivity to
pressure fluctuations (“pressure coupling”) is weak relative to these
other sources in low Mach number flows [192].10 The pathways for
longitudinal oscillations are present in this figure because of the
importance of transverse to longitudinal coupling [75].

10 Note however, that while the flame itself may not be very sensitive to pressure
disturbances, axial flow oscillations and fuel/air ratio oscillations may exhibit very
important pressure sensitivities. Thus, it is important to be precise with what one
means by “pressure-coupling”.

oscillations from induced longitudinal velocity oscillations, (c) effect of flow instabilities.

5.1. Overview of flame excitation processes

Four difference sources of heat release rate fluctuations, or flame
response, are shown in Fig. 30. The net flame response is a complex
summation of the transfer functions from these above sources, Ff,
FL, Fu, FT, multiplied by the disturbance source strength associated
with each process.

First, the flame can be directly excited by the transverse acoustic
field, and the flame transfer function FT (defined in Eq. (6)) describes
the magnitude and phase of the flame response to transverse acoustic
velocity fluctuations. Acoustic coupling between the transverse-
mode fluctuations in the combustor and longitudinal motion in the
nozzle, referred to as “injector coupling,” is described by the velocity
transfer function FTL. The resulting longitudinal acoustic fluctuations
also excite the flame, either through the velocity coupled mechanism,
FL, or by exciting fuel/air ratio oscillations, Ff.

Fuel/air ratio oscillations are excited in both gaseous and two-
phase flows. For example, axial acoustic disturbances in premixed
systems lead to a time varying air mass flow rate that the fuel is mixing
with. In two-phase flows, acoustic fluctuations in both transverse and
axial directions modulate spray breakup, atomization, and vapor-
ization processes. These fuel/air ratio fluctuations are induced by both
modulation of droplet sizes (discussed in Sec. 4.3) [269], as well as
modulation of the spray cone angle, moving the location of the fuel
droplets with respect to the air [268]. This pathway is described by the
transfer function Fuf. However, it is important to be precise about the
actual physical processes that result in heat release oscillation. In
premixed systems, the actual fuel/air ratio of the mixture reacted at
the flame is modulated [270]. In non-premixed systems, downstream
mixing could similarly lead to modulation of mixture stoichiometry,
but could also simply reflect modulation of some more global fuel/air
ratio, with the actual mode of burning remaining nonpremixed with a
local equivalence ratio of unity.

Returning to the acoustic-to-flow instability transfer functions,
FTu and FLu, the vortical velocity fluctuations that result from this
coupling can also lead to flame response. Such flame forcing by
vortical disturbances is shown in Figs. 20 and 21, and described by
the flame transfer function Fu. We will consider the influence of
these vortical disturbances on the flame further in this section.

5.2. Connection to Rayleigh criterion: role of characteristic times

Whether or not these pathways cause heat release fluctuations
that add energy to the acoustic field depends upon the phasing of
the unsteady heat release with respect to the pressure, following

Eq. (1). It is often more physically intuitive to equate the phase
between pressure and heat release, given by F, to a characteristic
time delay between them, tq, where the two are related by:

F 1⁄4

2ptq
Ta

(37)

where Ta denotes the acoustic period. The flame adds energy to the
acoustic field when:

F < p
2

/ (cid:2)

<

1
4

tq
Ta

< 1
4

(38)

This time delay, tq, is itself the sum of all the intermediate delays
associated with the progression from pressure disturbances to heat
release. This is illustrated in Fig. 31, which shows how acoustic
pressure disturbances propagate through the system and excite
different disturbances that lead to heat release oscillations e results
are shown for three of the different pathways in Fig. 30. This plot
clearly shows how the phase of the transfer functions between the
different steps or, equivalently, their time delays, control the con-
ditions under which the resultant heat release rate oscillations are
in phase with the pressure. For example, the middle plot shows
how pressure disturbances in a transverse disturbance lead to fuel/
air ratio disturbances and, consequently, heat release rate oscilla-
tions. In this case, the pressure and heat release rate oscillations are
in phase when the sum of the characteristic delay times shown in
the plot add up to an integer multiple of Ta, as expressed in Eq. (38).

5.3. Response of flames to direct transverse flow excitation
(FT pathway)

In order to understand the relative strength of the different
coupling pathways shown in the diagram in Fig. 30, it is useful to
note two key attributes of transverse excitation that differentiate it
from axial disturbances. First, while longitudinal disturbances are
generally axisymmetric, or at least approximately so, transverse
disturbances excite the flame in an intrinsically non-axisymmetric
manner that causes significant azimuthal variations in local
disturbance field at the flame sheet. As shown in Eq. (36) and
Table 3, transverse disturbances excite both axisymmetric and
helical/asymmetric disturbances in the flow, while axial distur-
bances excite mh 1⁄4 0/symmetric flow disturbances. Second, while
the flame does not locally differentiate between different vector
components of the velocity (being disturbed by the scalar velocity
component normal to it, as can be seen by manipulation of Eqs. (2)

5.5. Response of flames to vortical disturbances (FTu and FLu)

We next consider the flame response to hydrodynamic flow
disturbances, such as convecting vortices that are included in the Fu
path in Fig. 30. Assuming a polar coordinate system, the spatially
integrated unsteady heat release rate, shown in Eq. (4), is rewritten
as:

We can derive a very significant result for a general, axisym-
metric flame from this expression. For cases where all time aver-
aged variables are axisymmetric, i.e., ( )0 s fn(4), they can be pulled
out of the angular integral. Take, for example, the last term in Eq.
(41), which can then be written as:

and (3)), transverse and axial excitation cause profoundly different
influences upon the flame heat release oscillations when consid-
ered more globally. In the low frequency, quasi-steady limit, the
instantaneous heat release is directly proportional to the instan-
taneous mass flow rate of reactants into the flame [271]. As shown
in Fig. 32(a), axial disturbances modulate the mass flow rate of
reactants into the domain for both premixed and nonpremixed
flames and, as such, the low frequency transfer function for both
flames asymptotes to F 1⁄4 1 [170,179,271]; in other words, a 5% flow
velocity disturbance leads to a 5% fluctuation in heat release rate. In
contrast, Fig. 32(b) shows that purely transverse disturbances do
not modulate the reactant mass flow rate into the flame and, as
such, the low frequency flame transfer function asymptotes to zero
for both premixed and nonpremixed flames [126,178]. Thus, bulk
transverse flow disturbances can lead to significant wrinkling and
flapping of the flame, but no heat release oscillations. Transverse
flow disturbances lead to reactant mass flow modulation through
the flame, as in Fig. 32(b), only if the flux through the left and right
flame branches are not the same (such as if the center of the flame
is a velocity node), but this effect is relatively weak since the
transverse velocity fluctuations will necessarily be weak near the
node, unless the flame width is on the order of an acoustic
wavelength.

For this reason, the direct response of the flame to transverse
flow disturbances, the FT path in Fig. 30, is quite weak, as also
indicated in Fig. 31.

5.4. Response of flames to axial flow excitation (FL pathway)

We consider next the various longitudinal forcing pathways
shown in Fig. 30. Response of the flame to longitudinal acoustic
fluctuations can be quite significant. A significant body of well-
validated theory has been developed for modeling the response
of laminar flames to velocity disturbances using the flamelet ap-
proaches described in Sec. 2.2. For example, the transfer function of
a premixed flame excited by spatially uniform axial disturbances is
[32,172,272]:

Here, St is the Strouhal number and c is the flame aspect ratio.
Transfer functions of this form can then be used to describe the
response of the flame to bulk axial disturbances induced by
transverse waves described in Sec. 3.

it is the induced axial acoustic disturbances, as well as the sym-
metric or mh 1⁄4 0 hydrodynamic disturbances that are excited, that
dominate the flame response.

For this reason, we consider further the response of flame to
mh 1⁄4 0 disturbances. The transfer function of a premixed flame,
excited by an axisymmetric disturbance convecting at a speed of uc
is [32]:

While this simple result has been developed for a laminar flame
with spatially uniform mean velocity, more detailed calculations
that better represent the spatial variation of the mean velocity field,
and time averaged turbulent flame characteristics show quite good
agreement with measured flame responses [92,127].

The effect of helical instabilities on flame dynamics has been
investigated by several researchers [33,75,273,274] and support
the notion that excitation by symmetric disturbances dominate
flame response. For example, flame transfer function measure-
ments from transversely forced flames show that the response of
flames located at pressure anti-nodes is stronger than those at
nodes [75,95,177], in agreement with the above discussion. For
example, Fig. 33 plots measured flame transfer functions from
Acharya et al. [127], obtained from the facility as shown in
Fig. 8(b). Note the stronger response of the flame in the sym-
metric forcing case than the asymmetric forcing case for a given
velocity disturbance.

However, helical modes can lead to globally integrated heat release
oscillations if the nominal flame shape is non axisymmetric. These
for example,
non-axisymmetries can and do arise through,
confinement or flameeflame interactions, such as shown in Fig. 11.
In such cases, the asymmetric helical modes in the disturbance
flow-field lead to non-zero FTF contributions [128]. Thus,

An important implication of these results is that helical modes
(mh s 0), while introducing substantial wrinkling of the flame front,
do not lead to fluctuations in the azimuthally integrated heat release in
axisymmetric flames. Only if the time averaged flame position is not
axisymmetric do helical modes lead to net heat release oscillations.
Furthermore, while the above analysis has been carried out for
flamelets, similar reasoning would apply to any distributed com-
bustion zone as well. Thus, while transverse acoustic disturbances,
as well as the helical hydrodynamic disturbances that they excite
(e.g., see Table 3), can directly lead to significant flame flapping, the
heat release rate oscillations they excite may be quite small. Rather

instances where helical modes are much stronger than axisym-
metric ones (e.g., see the data in Fig. 27), the degree of flame non-
axisymmetry can determine which disturbance pathway in Fig. 30
is dominant. This result also shows that flame response measure-
ments taken from single flame configurations in circular geome-
tries, where the time averaged flame will be axisymmetric, can
differ from the response of flames located in non-circular geome-
tries or in multi-nozzle configurations with significant flame-
eflame interactions. The former geometry will effectively filter out
the effect of strong helical modes that may be present on the flame
response, while flames in the latter cases will have sensitivity to
these disturbances. This illustrates another challenge in scaling
transverse instability conditions with single nozzle configurations
that do not correctly emulate the flame shape.

assumed that the unsteady heat release equals the axial acoustic
flow velocity at the nozzle outlet multiplied by the transfer function
bF sðuÞ. This transfer function incorporates the response of the flame
to both axial acoustic flow disturbances and the axisymmetric
vortical disturbances they excite, given in Eqs. (39) and (45),
respectively. However, this model could be easily generalized to
include sensitivity of the flame to transverse disturbances, such as
might occur when transverse disturbances excite helical modes
that interact with a non-axisymmetric flame.

At the nozzle outlet into the annulus, and for frequencies well
below the nozzle cutoff frequency (for which transverse modes are
possible in a nozzle itself), the axial nozzle outlet velocity is related
to the pressure through the translated nozzle impedance as shown
in Eq. (13):

Having considered different elements of the problem, we now
present results from a simplified, quasi one-dimensional model
that combines many of the problem's key physical elements into an
overall thermoacoustic stability analysis of azimuthal modes. This
analysis follows the presentations by Stow et al. [79] and Par-
mentier et al. [122], and will consider azimuthal oscillations in a
ignoring plenum acoustics (see, e.g.,
thin annular combustor,
Bauerheim et al.
for inclusion of plenum effects). For
simplicity, we assume the nozzle flow upstream of the combustion
chamber is isothermal with properties given by the subscript (u),
and the combustor is isothermal at the burned gas temperature,
given by the subscript (b) (thus, assuming a short flame at the
nozzle outlet). We also neglect mean flow effects or entropy modes
(associated with entropy fluctuations incident upon nozzles that
excite acoustic waves).

The basic geometry is shown in Fig. 2, which consists of N
nozzles mounted at an azimuthal spacing ds, and identified with
the index s 1⁄4 1...N. Note that PN

it describes the influence of all upstream elements

following discussion, we shall express the flame transfer function
as: bF ðuÞ 1⁄4 n expð(cid:2)iutqÞ where nand tq are the frequency inde-

pendent gain and time-delay, respectively, discussed previously in
the context of Eqs. (6)e(7). From Eq. (76) and Eq. (77) in the Ap-
pendix, we can extract the imaginary part of the frequency, corre-
sponding to the exponential growth/decay rate of disturbances.
While a general solution can be calculated with computational
methods, explicit analytical results are derived next for the case
where G≪1 ðorÞ G[1 and bZ tr is independent of frequency.11 For
G≪1, we obtain:

pressure at the flame is weak, leading to low Rayleigh gains (see Eq.
(1)).

Finally, Im(u) has an oscillatory dependence upon ~tq. This shows
the effect of the heat release time delay upon stability limits, due to
the influence of this time delay parameter upon the pressure-heat
release phase. For this plots, it is convenient to define a normalized
frequency given by:

of unsteady heat release. Note that Eq. (54) can be further simpli-
fied for small values of n (or low amplification of the disturbance
by the flame):

The variation of Imð~uÞ for the G≪1 case is plotted in Fig. 35 for
both ma 1⁄4 1 and ma 1⁄4 2. As anticipated, the growth rate is an
oscillatory function of ~tq, and oscillates between positive and
negative values. Such oscillatory dependencies upon this dimen-
sionless time-lag can be inferred from Fig. 31 and have been well
documented in axial instability studies, such as summarized in the
results from Chapter 6 of Lieuwen [17].

Several observations can be gained from these expressions. First,
the instability growth/decay rate is a function of the four parame-

ters: n , ma, ~tqand ebZ tr. The two quantities N and (Acs,s/Acs,A) only
scale the growth/decay rate value, however, and do not influence
stability boundaries. Second, in the absence of heat release, n 1⁄4 0,
these expressions show that Im(u) < 0 when ReðebZ trÞ > 0 and, thus,
that oscillations are damped. This is due to the finite (though small)
damping imposed by ReðebZ trÞ at the inflow nozzles (note that outlet
nozzle damping is not incorporated in this simplified model). Third,
the instability growth/decay rate is directly proportional to the
number of nozzles, N, the nozzle/combustor area ratio (reflecting
the dependence of the unsteady heat release upon the axial
disturbance velocity), and either ebZ tr or 1=ebZ tr (for ebZ tr≪1 and ebZ tr[1,
respectively). This latter ebZ tr dependence shows that the instability
growth/decay rate is small for both of these cases. For the ebZ tr[1
case, the axial nozzle velocity is very small, leading to low ampli-
tude heat release oscillations. For the ebZ tr≪1 case, the acoustic

11 While assuming bZ tr is independent of the frequency is a useful assumption for
pedagogical purposes of showing explicit results, in reality bZ tr is a function of
frequency as shown in Eq. (13).

7. Concluding remarks and future work

Transverse modes are a dominant mode of combustion insta-
bility in a range of combustion devices, and the challenges associ-
ated with studying and controlling these modes are arguably
instabilities.
greater than those associated with longitudinal
Prominent observations from this review are organized next under
the headings of acoustics, hydrodynamics, and flame response:

(cid:8) Acoustics:

(cid:3) In annular combustion systems with large area ratios between
nozzles and the combustor cross sectional area, Acs;s=Acs;A
≪1,
the transverse mode acts as the “clock”, setting the frequency
and spatial structure of the acoustic forcing field. However, it
is the axial acoustic disturbances through the nozzle, and the
vortical disturbances that they excite, that often dominate the
flame response.

(cid:3) The sensitivity of the axial flow oscillations in the inflow
nozzles to transverse forcing are a function of the relative
location of the nozzle within the acoustic disturbance field
(e.g., a pressure node vs. anti-node), as well as the upstream
acoustic nozzle impedance. This nozzle impedance is gov-
erned by burner aerodynamics and plenum acoustics.

(cid:3) Boundary conditions have significant influences on transverse
modes. First, it is not possible to have a purely azimuthal or
radial mode for an open-ended (pressure release) boundary

32

condition e only mixed axial-transverse modes are possible.
In addition, choked nozzles cause lower acoustic losses to
transverse modes than axial ones.

Transverse motions in upstream plenums, though not discussed
extensively here, introduce additional degrees of freedom to the
problem.

observations are important for enabling the research community to
mobilize around key problems. Next, capturing the correct acoustic
boundary conditions and mode shapes has been shown to be a first-
order importance in determining the behavior of an unstable
combustor. The following research items address some of the needs
to better quantify the acoustic processes that occur during a com-
bustion instability.

(cid:8) Hydrodynamics:

(cid:3) High shear combustor flows are hydrodynamically unstable
and sensitive to acoustic perturbations. The response of the
hydrodynamic instabilities to acoustic perturbation depends
upon the flows convective/absolute instability character, the
acoustic frequency, and acoustic mode shape.

(cid:3) The same frequency acoustic disturbance can excite different
hydrodynamic modes (e.g., axisymmetric vs. helical modes in
jets), depending upon the location of the shear flow relative to
the acoustic disturbance field (e.g., acoustic pressure node vs.
antinode).
(cid:8) Flame response:

(cid:3) The flame's spatial integrated heat release is nearly insensitive
to direct transverse flow disturbances. However, it is quite
sensitive to axial acoustic disturbances, as well as axisym-
metric hydrodynamic disturbances.

(cid:3) The heat release rate of axisymmetric flames is insensitive to
helical flow disturbances. Thus, in flows with strong helical
modes, the degree of axisymmetry of the unforced flame (due
to, for example, flameeflame interactions or confinement ef-
fects) will profoundly influence its flame response.

Issues and challenges associated with simulating or scaling in-
stabilities have been discussed throughout the review. Key obser-
vations are:

(cid:8) Sub-scale arrangements are more challenging for simulating the
in-
acoustic transverse mode shapes than for longitudinal
stabilities, as the transverse scale of the combustor, not just its
length must be emulated. The degree to which this can be done
is often limited by air flow rate.

(cid:8) Transverse modes in circular geometries support traveling
waves, something which cannot be simulated in sector geom-
etries or rectangular geometries (where, in contrast, the axial
acoustic mode shapes in circular and sector/rectangular geom-
etries can be quite close to the full scale system), without
specialized forcing at the transverse boundaries.

(cid:8) Combustors with open (unrestricted) ends do not have a purely
transverse or radial mode, a major problem if one is attempting
to simulate the first tangential or radial mode of a combustor.
(cid:8) In many instances, the key flame response in acoustically
instabilities,
compact cases can be simulated with axial
assuming that the nozzle impedance and unforced flame shape
is correctly simulated.

(cid:8) While the flame response during an axial instability may be
comparable to that of a transverse instability, the combustor
damping is not, as the acoustic damping provided by a choked
nozzle for a transverse disturbance is half that of an axial one.

Future work to further understand and predict the behavior of
transverse combustion instabilities falls into several categories.
First, continued monitoring of instabilities in operational combus-
tion systems and determination of the conditions under which
transverse instabilities appear is a valuable asset to the scientific
and engineering community. In particular, there is little open
literature on can combustion systems. While data for operational
systems is usually proprietary, means for disseminating general

(cid:8) Inlet nozzle impedance and its dependence upon key parame-
ters is critical to understanding the extent of transverse to
longitudinal coupling. For example, acoustic calculations show a
strong sensitivity of the axial velocity induced by a transverse
wave [192] to often ignored properties such as fillet radii of the
outlet (note that an angle discontinuity excites an infinite
amplitude acoustic field in an inviscid framework). While
viscous effects and the excitation of vorticity (which can be
modeled by incorporating the Kutta condition [276]), will
smooth out this singularity, better understanding of how nozzle
influence transverse to longitudinal acoustic
parameters
coupling is needed.

(cid:8) The analysis in this review focused its attention on cases where
the inlet nozzle is acoustically compact to the transverse
acoustic mode. However, frameworks are needed for describing
problems in cases where this assumption is not appropriate,
such as in can-combustors, or during radial modes in annular
combustors.

(cid:8) Similarly, the nozzle cross-sectional area may not be small as
compared to the combustor cross-sectional area; this situation
is found regularly in can combustors or for radial modes in
annular combustors. While this situation can be modeled
without difficulty with 3-D Helmholtz solvers or LES, reduced
order modeling frameworks are needed for interpretation of
results, such as the transverse to longitudinal coupling process.

Some particular needs for better understanding the hydro-
dynamic response of the flow field to transverse acoustic fields
are.

(cid:8) Hydrodynamic stability characteristics of reacting swirl flows:
While a large and growing literature on this topic exists, the
generality of these results is major challenge. It is likely that
several general classes of problems exist (e.g., those dominated
by shear instability mechanisms vs those dominated by cen-
trifugal ones, or those where the flame lies inside or outside the
shear layer) and a “taxonomy” for classifying and interpreting
swirl flow results is needed. Such a taxonomy might include
general parameterizations on axial and azimuthal shear profiles,
density profiles, and Reynolds number.

(cid:8) Forced response of the convectively unstable flow: This recep-
tivity problem is indicated by by FTu and FLu in Fig. 30. Local
stability analysis results, such as absolute growth rate and
spatial growth rate, can exhibit different parametric sensitiv-
ities. A simple example is the strong sensitivity of the absolute
growth rate of a reacting wake to flame density ratio, but the
much weaker sensitivity of the spatial growth rate of the forced
flow problem.

(cid:8) Forced response of globally unstable flows: interaction between
nominal flow dynamics and the forcing is intrinsically nonlinear
and bifurcations and hysteresis in properties such as time
averaged flow features are often observed.

(cid:8) Response of two-phase flows to external forcing, including in-
fluence on droplet sizes, oscillatory spray location, fuel/air ratio
and mixedness distributions. Current models are largely
phenomenological and further insight is needed for develop-
ment of models and interpretive frameworks.

A limited number of studies have investigated the detailed flame
response to transverse instabilities, either on a local or global scale.
To this end, the follow issues should be addressed in order to better
understand flame response to transverse acoustic excitation and
the role it plays in driving the combustion instability.

(cid:8) Measurements of the response of flames to helical modes are
needed where the axisymmetry of the flame can be systemati-
cally varied.

(cid:8) Flame response to mixed transverse and longitudinal modes, as
well as instabilities with both spinning and standing waves.
(cid:8) How flame feedback influences the preference to spinning

versus standing modes.

Finally, work on active control of combustion instabilities is
needed. While active control has been demonstrated on transverse
instabilities, generally there is no a priori way of determining how
effective a given system will be. Reported values for the degree of
suppression of instabilities varies substantially in the literature
[277], and deeper understanding of the factors that influence how
effective a given device will be are needed.

The upstream inlet boundary (z 1⁄4 0) is considered to be rigid
and the temperature jump interface is located at z 1⁄4 Li. The mean

Although not necessary, for simplicity we will assume that the

Note that transverse modes excite vortical and entropy distur-
bances, whose amplitudes are determined by matching transverse
velocities and mass flow rate at the interface, respectively; how-
ever, the effect of these vortical and entropy disturbances on the
acoustic modes are a lower order effect, of O(M) and O(M2),
respectively, and are not calculated for space reasons (for example,
see Ref. [278] for the effect of vorticity waves on azimuthal in-
stabilities). Thus, using Eqs. (58)e(60) with Eq. (57) results in the

Consider the rigid (bZ out/∞) and pressure release (bZ out 1⁄4 0)
combustor exit boundary conditions, respectively. As discussed
in Sec. 3.1, these are good approximations for combustors with
open and choked outlets. We can define two reference fre-
quencies for the axial and transverse modes that are based on
time of travel arguments. A reference frequency for the purely
axial modes corresponds to the time of travel back and forth for a
wave across the distance L through the two regions of differing
sound speed:

where b 1⁄4 Li/L.

Similarly, a reference frequency for the transverse modes can be
defined based upon the weighted natural frequencies of the two
regions:

The energy balance in the control volume (CVs in Fig. 34) leads to

the expression [275]:

(cid:5)

(69)

The quantity bub

z;1;s denotes the unsteady velocity that stems
from both the axial inflow at the nozzle exit into the control
volume and the presence of heat release from the flame. This is
given by:

Acs;s bub

z;1;s 1⁄4 Acs;s buu

Following the results from Sec. 4.2, the unsteady heat release at
the s-th injector is assumed to be sensitive to the axial flow at the
nozzle outlet through the transfer function:
