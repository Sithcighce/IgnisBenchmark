1. Introduction

With the rapid development of the global electronics industry, waste printed circuit boards (WPCBs) has become
one  of  the  world’s  fastest  growing  waste  streams.  Exploring  an  environmentally  sound  treatment  for  this
abundant and multi-component waste is critical to its sustainable development. This study has been aimed to
cover  thermochemical  conversion  of  WPCBs  (combustion,  pyrolysis,  gasification  and  hydrothermal  process),
focusing  on  thermal  behavior,  reaction  kinetics,  pollutant  evolution  and  corresponding  controlling  strategies,
with the aim of promoting circular economic development and building a sustainable future for the electronics
industry.

The circular economy—a sustainable economic development mod-
el—is gradually replacing traditional models heavily relying on resource
consumption and waste generation [1–3]. It is critical to the sustainable
development  of  the  electronics  industry  because  waste  with  complex
components  and  resulting  from  the  end-of-life  cycle  of  electrical  and
electronic  equipment  (EEE), known  as  electrical  and  electronic  waste
(e-waste), has become one of the world’s fastest growing waste streams
[4–7]. The UN Global E-waste Monitor 2020 report revealed that 53.6
million  metric  tonnes  (Mt)  of  e-waste  were  generated  worldwide  in
2019, and this amount is expected to increase to 74.7 Mt by 2030 [8].
According to a report on the Chinese e-waste recycling industry, that
industry is estimated to have produced 0.80 billion units and 7.7 Mt of
scrapped residential EEE in 2021 [9].

Printed circuit boards (PCBs) are substantial constituent of EEE. In
conjunction with the rapid replacement of EEE, significant amount of

waste  PCBs  (WPCBs)  are  being  generated  (Fig.  1),  accounting  for
approximately 3–6 wt% of the total e-waste generated [10–12]. WPCBs
generally  contain  approximately  30  wt%  of  metals  [13],  in  which
precious metal contents (e.g. Au, Ag, Pd) are significantly higher to those
from natural ores. Therefore, they are regarded as a critical component
of urban mines, contributing to achieve circular economy targets and
reduce  raw  material  supply  risks.  D’Adamo  et  al.  [14]  assessed  the
economic potential of WPCBs and their net present value (NPV) varied
from  €6.8  million  for  medium-grade  WPCBs  to  €63.0  million  for
high-grade ones as compared with a NPV of €2.8 million for low-grade
ones.  Cucchiella  et  al.  [15,16]  explored  the  potential  profitability  of
WPCB recycling and the NPV varied within a range of €96,626–495,726
per  tonne  in  field  plant  and  within  a  range  of  €52,495–276,267  per
tonne in a mobile plant, with discounted payback period of one year.
Cordova-Pizarro et al. [17] evaluated the potential economic value of
waste  cellphones  generated  in  Mexico  using  a  material  flow  analysis.
WPCBs in cellphones offered a total value of €10.7–11.8 million each

year. Recovering valuable metals from WPCBs has become one of the
most profitable business cases in the recycling industry and an essential
part of the circular economy. To facilitate WPCBs recycling, different
sophisticated  technologies  have  been  developed  including  mechano-
physical approaches, pyrometallurgy, hydrometallurgy, biometallurgy,
electrolysis  and  supercritical  fluids  [18].  Mechanophysical  processes
have proven to be technologically feasible [11,19–21] and have been
extensively employed in the large-scale recycling of WPCBs. However, a
large number of non-metallic fractions of WPCBs (NMF-WPCBs) with the
major component of glass fiber and resin remain after metal recovery.
The advantages of hydrometallurgy are a high recovery rate and simple
processing  conditions  [22,23],  involving  a  series  of  acid  or  corrosive
leaching  processes  (with  highly  concentrated  solutions  generated),
which may cause secondary pollution. Biometallurgy has comparatively
inherent  advantages  including  low  environmental  impact  and  energy
consumption [24–26] but drawbacks of both low leaching efficiency and
long leaching time. Recently, there have been some critical reviews on
these technologies for WPCBs recycling: Huang et al. [27] introduced
the  status  of  WPCBs  treatment  in  China  and  an  integrated  recycling
process was proposed including crushing, corona–electrostatic separa-
tion,  metals  recovery  and  NMF-WPCBs  utilization.  Qiu  et  al.  [28]
compared the advantages and limitations of various recycling methods,
including crushing, magnetic separation, electrostatic separation, vac-
uum  gasification  and  condensation,  electrolysis,  and  bioleaching.

Awasthi  et  al.  [29]  conducted  the  SWOT  analysis  of  mechanical,
chemical  and  biological  methods  from  the  perspective  of  strengths,
weaknesses,  opportunities,  threats  and  challenges.  Mir  and  Dhawan
[30] provided an overview on metal recovery by physical, pyrometal-
lurgical, hydrometallurgical and combined technologies. As compared
to  other  approaches,  thermochemical  conversions  are  processes  that
utilize  temperature  and  pressure  rather  than  chemical  or  biological
catalysts  or  enzymes  to  produce  high-valued  hydrocarbons.  These
technologies offer the advantages of considerable volume reduction and
energy  recovery  [31–33].  Their  use  on  WPCBs  has  been  extensively
studied worldwide and more than 500 publications have been identified
in the Web of Science Database. However, there is a recognized absence
of comprehensive investigations on the thermochemical conversion of
WPCBs  in  the  scientific  literature,  especially  in  terms  of  pollutants
emission  and  their  control.  In  addition,  a  number  of  problems  and
challenges must be solved to promote the extensive application of this
method  in  practice.  Therefore,  various  thermochemical  conversion
processes of WPCBs, including combustion, pyrolysis, gasification and
hydrothermal process will be discussed in detail in this critical review.
The  thermal  behavior,  reaction  kinetics,  fate  of  flame  retardants  and
metals present in WPCBs, pollutant evolution and corresponding con-
trolling strategies are highlighted. Challenges and future studies are also
pointed  out.  Significant  references  will  be  given  relating  to  WPCBs
recycling and promoting the sustainable development of the electronics

industry.

2. Properties of WPCBs

WPCBs generally contain 30 wt% of metals, 30 wt% of polymers and
40  wt%  of  glass  fiber  (Table  1  and  Fig.  2).  In  terms  of  metals,  their
contents usually feature in a descending order of Cu > Al > Fe > Sn > Zn
> Ni > Pb > Sb > Ag > Au > Pt > Pd [34,35]. Cu is derived from copper
foil, which is used for conductive layers between the resin and fiber glass
structures [36]. Al and Fe are mostly used in soldering and lead frames.
Sn and Pb are from the soldering and connecting pins. Precious metals
including Ag, Au and Pd are present as contact materials or as coating
layers due to their high conductivity and chemical stability. Phenolic,
epoxy  and  unsaturated  polyester  resins  are  the  most  used  adhesive
materials  due  to  their  excellent  thermal  and  mechanical  properties.
During  PCBs  fabrication,  reinforcement  materials  such  as  glass  fiber
cloth and cellulose paper are impregnated in a resin solution mixed with
organic solvents and brominated flame retardants (BFRs). In the case of
NMF-WPCBs, the metal content decreases significantly to approximately
10 wt% because most of them (especially for Cu) have been separated
mainly  with  physical  crushing  and  separation  technologies.  Accord-
ingly, the contents of polymers and glass fiber increase to about 40 and
50 wt%. Bizzo et al. [37] conducted milling and separation of WPCBs by
density and further investigated the ultimate and proximate analysis of
samples with different particle sizes. The ultimate analysis for the light
(cid:0) 3) was determined as C 67.8, H 5.6, N 2.2
fraction (density of <2.9 g cm
and O 24.4 wt%. The proximate analysis revealed that the contents of
moisture, volatile matter, fixed carbon and ashes were calculated as 0.9,
39.9,  2.4  and  57.8  wt%,  respectively.  The  gross  calorific  value  was
(cid:0) 1. For comparison, the contents of moisture,
determined as 11.6 MJ kg
volatile matter, fixed carbon and ashes for the total fraction were re-
ported as 0.4, 16.7, 1.0 and 82.3 wt%, respectively. The gross calorific
(cid:0) 1.  Kumar  et  al.  [38]  also  studied  the
value  was  as  low  as  4.9  MJ  kg
ultimate analysis and calorific value of WPCBs. C, H, N, and O contents
were found as 18.5, 1.9, 0.5 and 79.1 wt% for shredded WPCBs, and
37.8, 4.1, 1.2 and 57.0 wt% for NMF-WPCBs, respectively. Their calo-
(cid:0) 1. Nie et al. [39]
rific values were determined as 9.2 and 15.3 MJ kg
measured  the  calorific  value  of  NMF-WPCBs  and  their  pyrolysis  resi-
(cid:0) 1 and they were 4.6
dues. The value for NMF-WPCBs reached 9.9 MJ kg
(cid:0) 1  for  residues  at  pyrolysis  temperatures  of  400  and
and  3.8  MJ  kg
800
C,  respectively.  Previous  reports  have  indicated  that  the  caloric
(cid:0) 1 [40,
value of WPCBs was ascertained in the range of 9.7–21.0 MJ kg
41],  which  is  comparable  to  a  lot  of  biomass  and  waste  materials
(cid:0) 1 and mixed
[42–44], although lower than that for coals at 20–30 MJ kg
(cid:0) 1 [45].
plastics at 30–40 MJ kg

3. Thermochemical conversion processes

Thermochemical conversion is perceived to be an indispensable part
of each integrated waste management system. The related decomposi-
tion  processes  take  place  at  relatively  high  temperatures  and  cause
modifications in the chemical structure of processed materials [63]. Due
to their advantages of significant waste reduction and energy recovery
[64],  thermochemical  conversion  methods  have  proven  to  be  more
technologically and economically feasible for organic waste. In general,
common  methods  involve  combustion,  pyrolysis,  gasification  and  hy-
drothermal  process.  A  schematic  representation  of  these  methods  is
visualized in Fig. 3.

3.1. Combustion

Combustion is one of the most common conversions for solid waste
which  can  significantly  reduce  the  waste  volume  by  converting  the
organic fractions under oxidizing conditions, transforming combustible
constituents into energy [63,65]. Different combustion systems can be
distinguished  by  the  flow  conditions  in  the  furnace,  including  rotary

enriched  or  recovered  in  Cu  and  Pb  refinement  processes,  such  as
leaching and electrowinning [68].

◦

During combustion, various factors influencing performance include
WPCBs’ properties, retention time, temperature, turbulence and excess
air  coefficient.  Ni  et  al.  [69]  used  a  continuously  fed  drop-tube  com-
bustion  system  to  study  the  high-temperature  incineration  of  WPCBs
(cid:0) 1. Process parameters such as tem-
with a heating value of 11.4 MJ kg
C), excess air factor (1.2–1.9) and residence time
perature (800–1400
(0.25,  0.50  and  0.75  s)  were  studied  for  optimum  performance.  CO
(cid:0) 3 and the carbon
concentration in flue gas decreased to ca. 40 mg Nm
content of residues was less than 1 wt% at 1200
C, excess air factor of
1.3 and residence time of 0.75 s. Szalatkiewicz [70] used plasma com-
bustion to recover energy and metals from WPCBs. The heating value
(cid:0) 1,  and  a  total  heat  of  292  MJ  was
was  determined  to  be  9.7  MJ  kg
released during 1 h of operation using 30 kg of this waste.

kilns and fixed-bed, fluidized-bed, entrained-flow and plasma furnaces
[66]. During combustion, organic polymers in WPCBs provide extra heat
for the conversion and thus reduce energy costs. Metal-rich residues are
obtained after polymer decomposition, therefore, it is commonly used as
a pretreatment to concentrate metals in the raw material. Some com-
panies have recently used this pyrometallurgical enrichment followed
by hydrometallurgical separation to recycle WPCBs including Umicore
in Belgium and the Dowa group in Japan, which offers advantages of
increased  productivity,  good  adaptability  and  a  high  metal  recovery
[67]. The processes are based on complex Cu/Pb/Ni metallurgy, using
these base metals as collectors for precious metals and special metals.
Crushed WPCBs are fed into a smelter together with Cu/Pb concentrates
at  a  temperature  of  ~1200
C.  Plastics  or  other  organic  substances
contained  in  the  feed  can  partially  substitute  the  coke  as  a  reducing
agent  and  energy  source.  Precious  and  non-precious  metals  in  these
materials are collected as copper matte/blister copper/lead bullion and
separated from most other metals in slag. These valuable metals can be

3.2. Pyrolysis

Pyrolysis is a conversion process for the decomposition of organic
materials at increased temperatures in the absence of oxygen [71,72]. In
comparison to combustion, pyrolysis has a lower operating temperature
◦
(≤1000
C) and a lower level of pollutant emissions. Different reactions
are involved in this process, namely polymer decomposition, free radical
reactions,  secondary  cracking  and  polymerization  reactions  [73].
Several techniques have been proposed, such as vacuum pyrolysis [74],
plasma pyrolysis [75] and microwave-assisted pyrolysis [76,77]. Chien

residues enriched in copper (90–95%), 40.6 wt% of oil and 24.9 wt% of
noncondensable  gas.  Zhou  et  al.  [79]  also  investigated  yields  of
three-phase  products.  An  average  product  composition  of  68.0  wt%
residue, 27.7 wt% oil and 4.3  wt% gas was  obtained for paper-based
WPCBs as compared to 72.2 wt% residue, 21.5 wt% oil and 6.4 wt%
gas for glass-reinforced WPCBs. Chen et al. [60] analyzed the pyrolysis
products  for  NMF-WPCBs  at  temperatures  of  450–800
C.  The  liquid
product contained phenol (maximum yield of 19.7%). More than 70 wt
% of the raw material remained solid after decomposition and it was rich
in glass fiber and metals. The gaseous species were mainly composed of
H2, CH4  and CO2. Zhou and Qiu [80] conducted vacuum pyrolysis on
WPCBs at 240
C, obtaining a solid yield of 69.5 wt%. The gas product
with a yield of 4.4 wt% was rich in CO, CO2, CH4  and H2. The energy

recovered  from  the  combustion  of  the  gas  may  be  used  to  initiate  a
self-sustained process. Bai et al. [75] designed a three-phase alternating
current  arc  plasma  pyrolysis  device  able  to  break  the  long  chains  of
organic macromolecules for WPCBs and destroyed the strong adhesion
between  metals  and  glass  fiber,  facilitating  subsequent  separation.
Suriapparao  et  al.  [81]  employed  microwave-assisted  pyrolysis  for
WPCBs valorization, with a maximum oil yield of 27 wt% with 38% of
overall  energy  recovery  was  obtained.  Zhang  et  al.  [82]  conducted
microwave-assisted  pyrolysis  at  temperatures of  350–650
C.  Phenols
were the main liquid products, with a maximum yield of 27.8 wt%. The
total contents of CO2, CO, CH4 and H2 in the noncondensable gas were
10.4%  at  350

additionally  recycled  WPCBs  using  microwave-induced  pyrolysis  fol-
lowed by mechanical processing. During pyrolysis, an average yield of
78.6 wt% for residue, 15.7 wt% for oil, and 5.7 wt% for gas was ob-
tained.  The  solid  residue  displayed  main  forms  as  metallic  balls  and
copper foil. They became more fragile and were rich in metals. The oil
was  mainly  composed  of  phenol,  4-(1-methylethyl)-phenol,  p-phenyl-
phenol  and  2-methylphenol.  The  total  content  areas  of  phenol  and
substitute phenols were over 70%. The most abundant gases were H2,

(cid:0) 1, however, they were determined as 123.7 kJ mol

In addition to individual pyrolysis, WPCBs were also co-pyrolyzed
with organic waste to improve the quality and yield of resulting prod-
ucts, with a role of hydrogen donors in debromination reactions. Shen
et al. [83] conducted the co-pyrolysis of pretreated NMF-WPCBs with
rice husk as well as three main components (cellulose, hemicellulose and
(cid:0) 1, the apparent activation energy
◦
lignin). At a heating rate of 5
(Ea) values for individual NMF-WPCBs and rice husk were determined as
(cid:0) 1 for the blend with
(cid:0) 1, while it was 80.8 kJ mol
74.8 and 83.0 kJ mol
mass ratio of 1:2. These results pointed to a synergistic effect between
the  two  individual  waste,  which  improved  the  thermolysis  efficiency
and  reduced Ea  values. Jadhao et  al.  [84] reported  co-pyrolysis char-
acteristics of macroalgae (Sargassum wightii) with WPCBs. Ea values from
Friedman method for macroalgae and WPCBs were 121.4 and 138.6 kJ
(cid:0) 1  for blended
mol
samples with mass ratio of 1:3. Volatiles in biomass, minerals in biomass
ashes  and  metals  in  WPCBs  may  significantly  enhance  the  thermal
decomposition profiles. Yao et al. [85] investigated co-pyrolysis kinetics
of  NMFs-WPCBs  with  rice  husk  using  model-free  and  model-fitting
methods.  A  significant  mass  loss  was  observed  at  270–500
C,  larger
than that for the two individual waste feedstocks. Results indicated that
the decomposition of the blend was inhibited by the synergistic effect
between the two raw materials. Prajapati et al. [86,87] also conducted
the co-pyrolysis of WPCBs with cotton stalk in a fixed-bed reactor. The
degradation profile of blend samples was initiated at a lower tempera-
ture than that for two individual samples. The oil yield increased from
19.6  wt%  for  individual  WPCBs  pyrolysis  to  31.5  wt%  for  the
co-pyrolysis of blend samples. The phenol and phenolic compounds in
oil increased from 60.7 to 78.6 wt%. Ma et al. [88] observed a syner-
gistic  interaction  during  the  rapid  co-pyrolysis  of  WPCBs  with  waste
tires.  The  proportion  of  aliphatic  and  aromatic  compounds  was
increased. Meanwhile, the heteroatoms concentrated in higher boiling
point compounds were beneficial for the separation and purification of
highly value-added products.

3.3. Gasification

Gasification involves partial oxidation of organic fractions including
a pyrolysis stage that finally converts those compounds into syngas. A
gasifier can use air, steam, O2, CO2, or a mixture of these as gasification
agents [89–91]. WEEE gasification for syngas production is a feasible
pathway  for  the  chemical  degradation  of  polymers.  Yamawaki  [92]
◦
concluded that gasification at 1150
C, followed by a shock cooling step,
was effective to decompose BFRs. Recent studies have featured labora-
tory experiments on steam gasification of WPCBs in molten carbonates.
Salbidegoitia  et  al. [93] conducted  the steam  gasification of  phenolic

boards in Li2CO3–Na2CO3–K2CO3 eutectic mixtures. Metals were easily
recovered  from  this  system  and  plastics  were  converted  into  energy
carriers. Zhang et al. [94] used steam gasification to treat phenolic and
epoxy  boards.  The  application  of  molten  carbonate  accelerated  the
steam gasification performance and significantly promoted the yield of
gas over char and tar. In the case of the epoxy boards’ gasification, H2
and  CO2  were detected  as  the  main  products. Li  et  al.  [95]  also  con-
ducted  the  steam  atmosphere  heating  of  WPCBs.  The  yields  of  solid
products and  oil were 65.5 and 27.3 wt%, respectively. Gas products
were mainly composed of H2 and CH4, with a calorific value of 21.7 MJ
(cid:0) 3. The oil contained a variety of phenolic chemicals, with phenol and
m
alkylated phenol as the main component.

3.4. Hydrothermal processes

(cid:0)
and OH

Hydrothermal  processes  involve  the  heating  of  organic  waste  at
elevated pressures to produce an energy carrier with increased energy
density [96]. In this conversion, the water serves as an important me-
dium as well as a reactant to convert waste into valuable end-products in
the  absence  of  free  oxygen  (low  oxygen  partial  pressures).  This  tech-
nique can be divided into three subgroups—hydrothermal carbonization
(HTC), hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) and hydrothermal gasification
(HTG)—depending on the operating conditions [97–99]. All of them are
performed in aqueous medium with its sub/supercritical states, where
the former state is at temperatures of 100–374
C, with pressure high
enough to maintain the liquid state. When the water condition exceeds
◦
C, Pc = 221 bar), it acquires the supercritical
the critical point (Tc = 374
state [100]. HTC takes place at lower temperatures (180–250
C) and
20–40 bar pressure, generating a solid product (hydrochar), but also an
aqueous  product  (process  water)  and  a  small  amount  of  gas  (mainly
CO2).  Water  at  HTC  condition  is  helpful  for  generating  high  concen-
trations of H3O
, which can be used as a catalytic medium and
beneficial to hydrolysis, dehydration, recondensation and decarboxyl-
ation reactions [101,102]. The detailed reaction mechanisms depends
on feedstock composition. HTL is conducted at moderate temperatures
◦
of 250–375
C and pressures up to 180 bar. Under such thermodynamic
conditions, water molecules self-ionize, favoring complex reactions such
as degradation and condensation due to the catalytic effect of the ions.
Macromolecules are decomposed leading typically to the formation of
four phases: crude-like oil, an aqueous phase containing dissolved polar
organics, hydrochar and a small amount of gas (CO2, CH4, CO, H2, etc.).
Comparably, HTG takes place at temperatures and pressures above
the critical point of water, where free radical mechanisms reactions are
dominated  and  a  syngas  mixture  rich  in  H2  and  CH4  is  produced.  In
previous reports of hydrothermal conversion of WPCBs, HTL reactions
have  been  the  main  focus.  Yin  et  al.  [103]  decomposed  WPCBs  at
sub/supercritical water conditions and more than 80% of the resin was
mainly decomposed into phenol at temperatures above 300
C. Yildirir
et al. [104] investigated the hydrothermal depolymerization of WPCBs.
A removal rate of 94 % was achieved in the presence of NaOH–KOH at
◦
400
C. The liquid product was mainly composed of phenol and phenolic
compounds. Wang et al. [105] used supercritical water to gasify WPCBs
at temperatures of 500–750
C and a pressure of 230 bar. Larger mo-
lecular weight organics such as phenols and derivatives were generated
at  500
C.  To  guide  this  technology  towards  commercialization,
Lachos-Perez et al. [99] evaluated the environmental sustainability and
economic implications of these methods. To make the resulting products
competitive  with  petroleum-based  products,  it  is  needed  to  optimize
various  factors  including  government  incentives,  product  functionali-
zation, economy of scale, sustainability and self-production of energy,
operation with many feedstocks, among others.

Other aspects of the thermochemical process should also be taken
into account. In terms of the waste volume reduction and efficiency of
metal  recovery,  combustion  seems  to  be  better  than  other  methods.
However, it is an open process with a continuous flow of gases through
the reactor and a large volume of exhaust gases must be discharged. In

comparison to this, these direct emissions can be avoided in the case of
pyrolysis. Gases from pyrolysis can be considered as a potential resource
of energy or chemical products. The remaining problem is that the char
in  the  solid  product  may  disturb  subsequent  metal  recovery.  From  a
chemical point of view, pyrolysis oil has a complex composition with
some drawbacks such as high water and oxygen content, high viscosity
and strong corrosiveness [106,107]. Oil upgrading technologies such as
catalytic hydrogenation, catalytic cracking and steam reforming need to
be employed to improve its quality. Gasification with steam does not
have  these  inconveniences,  and  practically  all  organic  materials  are
eliminated  from  gasified  waste.  Moreover,  waste  from  gasification
feature  open  porosity,  which  facilitates  their  penetration  by  leaching
solutions or gases. As a result, the solid product appears to be better for
hydrometallurgical  processes  [63].  Compared  to  other  methods,  the
hydrothermal process is easy to apply and simple to operate. However,
its features mean that the operating capacity is limited and not appli-
cable  for  large-scale  operations.  In  addition,  the  quality  of  the  liquid
product  and  hydrochar  is  not  comparable  with  that  for  pyrolysis
(Table 2).

4. Thermal behavior and reaction kinetics

4.1. Combustion

Basic  theories  of  kinetic  models  for  solid  fuels  can  be  found  in
literature [85]. Model-fitting and model-free (isoconversional) methods
are  two  major  kinetic  approaches.  For  the  model-fitting  method,
different  reaction  models  have  been  proposed  including  the  Coat-
s–Redfern (CR) method, iterative procedure, master plots method and
distributed  activation  energy  model  (DAEM)  [108].  However,
model-free methods are not dependent on any reaction mechanisms and
atomistic assumptions, and the parameters are determined as a function
of the conversion degree (α) [109]. They mainly include the Friedman
method, Flynn–Wall–Ozawa (FWO) method, Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose
(KAS)  method  and  those  proposed  by  Vyazovkin,  Starink,  Tang  and
Boswell  (Table  3).  Reaction  kinetics  for  various  processes  including
combustion for converting WPCBs are listed in Table 4. Yan et al. [110]

4.2. Pyrolysis

Common  models  used  in  pyrolysis  were  basically  similar  to  those
utilized in combustion processes (Table 3). Liu et al. [123] studied the
pyrolysis  behavior  and  reaction  kinetics  for  Cu-free  and  Cu-coated
WPCBs  using  the  thermogravimetric  (TG)  analysis  coupled  with
Fourier-transformed  infrared  spectrometry  (FTIR)  and  applying  the
FWO model. The decomposition of Cu-free WPCBs was divided into four
stages.  Stage  I  (α  < 0.075)  was  attributed  to  the  breakage  of  N-con-
taining cross-linkages and the corresponding Ea  was determined to be
(cid:0) 1. In Stage II (0.075 < α < 0.85), the chemical bonds were
119 kJ mol
irregularly  cleaved  with  the  decomposition  of  brominated  and
non-brominated compounds, with Ea  gradually increasing from 119 to
(cid:0) 1. In Stage III (0.85 < α < 0.9), the decomposition of non-
357 kJ mol

brominated compounds continued and Ea decreased to 279 kJ mol
(cid:0) 1.
the  final  stage  (α  > 0.9),  Ea  reached  a  peak  value  of  516  kJ  mol
However, only two stages were observed in the pyrolysis of Cu-coated
(cid:0) 1 as
WPCBs. In Stage I (α < 0.85), Ea increased steadily to 124 kJ mol
(cid:0) 1).
compared to a significant increase in Stage II (α > 0.85, 393 kJ mol
These results indicated the catalytic role of Cu present in WPCBs, seen
from the shorter reaction time and lower Ea values. Ortu ̃no et al. [111]
(cid:0) 1 for Cu-coated WPCBs
also reported an Ea value of 67.1–300.2 kJ mol
(cid:0) 1  for  Cu-free  counterparts.  The
as  compared  to  88.6–280.4  kJ  mol
presence of metals catalyzed the decomposition of organic matter and
decreased the energy required to initiate the reaction. Gao et al. [124]
additionally investigated the catalytic effects and mechanisms of Cu on
ˇ
Sest ́ak–Berggren model. The presence of
WPCBs pyrolysis based on the
Cu  can  change  the  mechanism  function,  leading  Ea  to  decrease  from
(cid:0) 1  and the initial temperature to decrease from
175.6 to 164.5 kJ mol
◦
281.9 to 262.5
C. In addition, the conversion of organic bromides such
as bromomethane, bromoethane, 2-bromophenol and 2,4-dibromophe-
nol into Br2  and HBr was promoted. Except for Cu, self-catalytic roles
of  Fe  and  Ni  were  reported  by  Chen  et  al.  [125].  Adding  Fe  and  Ni
resulted  into  a  decrease  of  Ea  from  an  average  value  of  246.0  for
(cid:0) 1, respectively. As compared to
NMF-WPCBs to 230.0 and 175.0 kJ mol
Cu and Fe, Ni played a better catalytic role. In our previous studies [20,
21],  the  decomposition  of  NMF-WPCBs  could  be  divided  into  three
stages with temperatures of 37–330
C,
respectively  (Fig.  4).  Stage  I  was  attributed  to  the  cleavage  of  ether
bonds  in  the  resin.  A  weight  loss  in  Stage  II  was  ascribed  to  the

5.1. Combustion

Currently, e-waste open burning can still be found in several coun-
tries  including  South  Africa,  Ghana,  India,  Pakistan,  Vietnam  and
Thailand. During these uncontrolled and environmentally unprotected
treatments, incomplete combustion results in the release of metal-rich
particulate  matter  (PM).  Gangwar  et  al.  [137]  monitored  PM10  and
heavy metal concentrations (Pb, Cu, Zn, Ni and Cr) at illegal e-waste
recycling sites in Moradabad City, India, where they found extremely
high levels of pollution. Mowla et al. [138] reported air contamination
with  e-waste-derived  heavy  metals  in  recycling  shops  in  Dhaka,
Bangladesh.  In  the  case  of  particles  larger  than  10  μm,  the  highest
concentration of heavy metals was detected for Cu, followed by Pb, Mn,
Ni  and  Cr.  During  WPCBs  combustion,  bromine  and  chlorine  present
have  an  intensifying  effect  on  metal  volatility,  generating  inorganic
bromides including CuBr, ZnBr2  and PbBr2, etc. [139]. Dust-collecting
systems  such  as  activated  carbon  filters  need  to  be  deployed  to  pre-
vent their uncontrolled emission. During open burning, toxic pollutants
such  as  brominated  dioxins  and  furans  (PBDD/Fs)  are  also  generated
[140].  S ̈oderstr ̈om  and  Marklund  [141]  co-combusted  BFRs  with
municipal  solid  waste  in  a  pilot-scale  fluidized  bed  incinerator  and
brominated  organic  compounds  were  formed  during  cooling  of  flue
gases. Theoretical calculations showed that there was more Br2 than Cl2
in the flue gas. Tue et al. [19] investigated the concentrations of halo-
genated  dioxins  and  furans  in  surface  soil  samples  from  an  e-waste
recycling site. The median total WHO toxic equivalent concentration in
open burning soils was seven times higher than allowed U.S. action level
(cid:0) 1. Duan et al. [142] reported that the maximum formation
of 1000 pg g
rate  of  mixed  halogenated  dioxins/furans  (PXDD/Fs)  was  found  in  a
temperature  range of  250–400
C.  At  higher  temperatures,  their  con-
centrations decreased and they were totally destroyed at 600
C. The
conditions for the PXDD/Fs formation were an oxidizing atmosphere,
halogenides and catalysts.

Polybrominated  diphenyl  ethers  (PBDEs),  tetrabromobisphenol  A
(TBBPA)  and  hexabromocyclododecane  (HBCD)  constitute  most  com-
mon  BFRs,  being  direct  precursors  to  PBDD/Fs  formation  in  thermal
systems  (with  at  least  two  steps  involved  in  such  conversion).  There
have been some theoretical studies on the formation mechanism using
the density functional theory (DFT) method. The mechanism is believed
to  consist  on  the  intramolecular  elimination  of  bromine  and/or
hydrogen bromide. Br2  or HBr elimination from the molecule leads to
ring closure, forming PBDD/Fs [143]. PBDEs have been firstly used as an
example to describe the process by which PBDD/Fs form (Fig. 5). The
loss of an ortho Br or H atom to generate lower PBDEs with an ortho--
carbon radical, followed by a ring closure reaction, is the most accessible
pathway to PBDFs production via moderate reaction barriers. The direct
removal  of  an  H  atom  from  PBDEs  can  also  be  caused  by  an  oxygen
• radicals.  Then  the  outer
molecule,  resulting  in  the formation  of  HO2
oxygen atom in the peroxy group acts as a bridge to the pivotal carbon
atom of the other phenyl ring [143–145]. Wang et al. [146] investigated
the thermal degradation of decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209) using
DFT methods. PBDF formation derived from the cyclization reaction of
ortho-carbon radical. PBDD generation involved an ortho-C–O coupling
reaction of polybromophenoxy radicals (R-PhOep•), debromination and
cyclization  reactions.  Yang  et  al.  [147]  also  employed  DFT  to  probe
PBDD/Fs  formation  during  co-processing  of  BDE-209  in  cement  kiln
simulation system. Formation of precursors was the main pathway for
PBDD/Fs and those precursors were dominated by higher-brominated
PBDEs  (hepta-to  deca-BDEs).  In  the  case  of  TBBPA,  the  formation  of
PBDD/Fs comprised two steps: precursor generation and condensation
[145].  Of  the  bromine  precursors,  2,4-dibromophenol  (diBP)  was  re-
ported to have a higher potential to form PBDD/Fs as compared to its
analogues [148]. Depending on the position of bromine atoms on the
phenol  ring,  the  subsequent  condensation  process  can  be  subdivided

gasification performance include temperature, pressure, waste particle
size, steam-to-waste ratio, etc. Various kinetic models have been pro-
posed  to  characterize  the  steam  gasification  of  char  such  as  homoge-
neous, shrinking core, n-th order, random pore and modified random
pore models [126–128]. Zhang et al. [94] performed steam gasification
of a phenolic board in a ternary carbonate medium. The effects of the
particle size and heating rate were investigated using a homogeneous
kinetic model [129]. The yields of gas, tar, and char were quantified to
be 16.3–19.5, 49.4–53.0 and 30.7–31.1 wt%, respectively. The presence
of molten salts accelerated both the initial rapid pyrolysis and the sec-
ondary  steam  gasification  processes.  Gasification  performance  was
affected by the particle size and char properties due to the infiltration of
molten salt into the char. The reaction mechanisms for particles less than
0.15 mm in size can best be described by the homogeneous model, while
larger particles with a size of more than 1.0 mm reacted through a more
complex mechanism. Salbidegoitia et al. [93] conducted WPCBs gasifi-
cation  in  the  ternary  carbonate  medium.  Two  steps  were  involved,
which corresponded to pyrolysis followed by the gasification of char.
The  presence  of  nickel  played  a  catalytic  role  in  the  gasification  per-
formance. Ea  values for the pyrolysis were determined as 173 and 177
(cid:0) 1 with or without steam, respectively, indicating that steam did
kJ mol
not have a significant effect on the pyrolysis stage of WPCBs.

4.4. Hydrothermal processes

Hydrothermal  processes  are  a  thermochemical  conversion  method
that is used to convert organic waste into valuable products or liquid
fuels.  The  main  factors  influencing  the  process  include  reaction  tem-
perature, pressure and time. There is a wide-ranging lack of knowledge
on the kinetics of hydrothermal processes for WPCBs, and the kinetic
models  employed  for  biomass  conversion  are  mostly  based  on  the
Arrhenius equation. Yin et al. [103] investigated the effects of temper-
ature, time and additives on resulting products distribution. Two types
of decomposition pathways were present: hydrolysis at lower tempera-
tures  and  pyrolysis  at  higher  temperatures.  Liquid  products  mainly
contained organic compounds shaped by 6–15 carbon atoms. Xing and
Zhang  [130]  used  sub/supercritical  water  to  recover  metals  from
WPCBs.  Liquid  products  were  mainly  composed  of  phenol  and
4-(1-methylethyl)-phenol.  Glass  fibers  and  copper  foil  in  the  residue
were easily liberated for further recovery. Huang et al. [131] selected a
ZnCl2/CH3COOH  solution  as  a  catalyst  to  decompose  epoxy  resin  in
WPCBs, investigating the influence of reaction temperature, time, liq-
uid/solid  ratio  and  ZnCl2  amount  on  decomposition  efficiency.  Up  to
81.9 % of the resin was decomposed at a temperature of 190
C and it
was converted into phenol, 2-bromophenol and 2,4-dibromophenol.

into  two  different  pathways:  bromophenols  containing  ortho-bromine
atoms  produce  2,7-dibromodibenzo-p-dioxin  (diBDD)  via  brominated
phenoxyphenol,  while  the  ortho-hydrogen  produces  2,4,8-tribromodi-
benzofuran  (triBDF)  via  brominated  dihydroxybiphenyl.  Compara-
tively,  2,6-diBP  and  2,4,6-triBP  (with  Br  atoms  at  the  two  ortho
positions)  produced  no  benzofurans.  Despite  the  long-held  viewpoint
that  only  substituted  dioxins  could  be  formed  from  the  ortho-disub-
stituted  phenols,  many  authors  have  observed  the  formation  of  both
halogenated dioxins and furans in experimental studies [149,150]. In
fact,  the  recent  work  by  Chang  et  al.  [151]  demonstrated  a  feasible
pathway for the formation of brominated furans from 2,4,6-tribromo-
phenol (TBP). They suggested a mechanism by which bromophenoxyl
radical,  the  substituted  phenyl  radical  and  phenoxyl  diradical  are
formed. Self- and cross-condensation of the three radical species and 2,4,
6-triBP  subsequently  yielded  1,3,6,8-TeBDD  and  1,3,7,9-TeBDD,  but
also  1,3,6,8-TeBDF  and  2,4,6,8-TeBDF.  Using  a  horizontal  laboratory
furnace, Die et al. [152] carried out combustion experiments to study
the formation of PBDD/Fs from the thermal degradation of 2,4,6-triBP
and  proposed  possible  formation  pathways.  2,4,6,8-TBDF  was  sug-
gested to be produced as a result of 2,4,6-TBP debromination and sub-
sequent C–C coupling reactions of radical intermediates. Toxic PBDD/Fs
congeners  would  be  formed  only  through  more  complex  reactions,
involving  debromination,  bromine  substitution  and  rearrangement
steps.

In  addition  to  reactant  species,  PBDD/Fs  formation  from  bromo-
phenols also depends on reaction temperature. Na et al. [148] investi-
gated the thermal behavior of three precursors (2,4-diBP, 2,6-diBP and
2,4,6-triBP)  at  300–500
C.  Dioxins  obtained  at  highest  yield  were

could  not  produce  any  congeners  of  PBDD/Fs,  but  its  co-combustion
with  extruded  polystyrene  resulted  in  the  formation  of  two  PBDD/Fs
[154], indicating the presence of de novo synthesis rather than a pre-
cursor  pathway.  However,  brominated  biphenyls  (PBBs)  from  HBCDs
pyrolysis can act as building blocks for PBDFs.

5.2. Pyrolysis

Unlike combustion, pyrolysis is carried out in an oxygen-free atmo-
sphere, not only producing a variety of products such as gas, tar and
char,  but  also  reducing  PXDD/Fs  generation.  However,  the  bromine
present in WPCBs is transferred into the gas and liquid products, leading
to environmental concerns and limiting their use as fuels or chemical
feedstocks,  respectively.  The  intermediate  product  (polybrominated
biphenyls)  from  HBCD  co-pyrolysis  with  polybutylene  terephthalate
◦
polymers produces PBDFs at 400–700
C, without any PBDD analogues
being  detected  [155].  Chien  et  al.  [78]  analyzed  the  fate  of  bromine
during WPCBs pyrolysis. Approximately 72.3 wt% of bromine was found
as HBr and bromobenzene in the off-gas. Species with a bromine content
of 1.3%, such as bromobenzene, were observed in the tar and only 5.1 %
bromine remained in the solid residues. Chen et al. [156] revealed that
more than 60 wt% of bromine in NMF-WPCBs was transferred into the
gas and 36 wt% was fixed in the char. Evangelopoulos et al. [157] re-
ported that the tar yield and bromine content reached a maximum of 0.5
wt% in the tar. The present brominated compounds were 2-bromo-phe-
nol, 2-bromo-4-chloro-phenol and 1-(bromomethyl)-4-methyl-benzene.
A  larger  fraction  of  bromine  was  transferred  to  the  gas  phase,  as  ex-
pected,  at  increasing  temperatures.  The  bromine  in  the  residue  was
mainly in the form of CuBr3, which was confirmed by the report from
Gao et al. [124]. Zhao et al. [158] also observed CuBr and CuBr2 phases
in solid residue from WPCBs pyrolysis in a continuous tubular reactor.

Z. Yao et al.

Deng et al. [159] attempted to recover bromide from WPCB smelting

C and did not find Cu–Br species in the residue using extended
X-ray  absorption  fine  structural  spectroscopy.  In  their  study  on  the
thermochemical  conversion  of  WPCBs,  Cu–Br  species  was  also  not
detected [160].

During  pyrolysis  of  FR4  type  WPCBs,  our  previous  report  [20]
analyzed  the  fate  of  bromine using  TG-FTIR-GC/MS analysis  (Fig.  6).
Results  indicated  that  various  brominated  derivatives,  especially  bro-
moethane,  were  generated.  The  released  quantities  of  bromopropane
and bromoacetone were comparable but reduced as compared to bro-
mopropene. More dibromophenol was released with respect to bromo-
phenol.  During  the  thermal  process,  part  of  the  ether  bonds  in  the
brominated resin cleaved at temperatures below 335
C, forming three
major evolved product, namely bisphenol A, propyl alcohol and TBBPA.
At temperatures of 335–734
C, TBBPA decomposed into bromophenol
and  hydrogen  bromide,  which  further  reacted  with  small  molecules
(degradation  of  bisphenol  A  and  propyl  alcohol)  forming  brominated
products  such  as  methyl  bromide,  bromoethane,  bromopropene  and
bromopropane.  At  the  last  stage,  most  organics  were  decomposed,
forming smaller molecules. Among the metals present in WPCBs, Sb2O3
is  commonly  used  in  BFRs-polymers  formulations,  having  a  relevant
effect  on  bromine  migration.  SbBr3  was  detected  in  the  residue,  con-
firming  the  reaction  between  Sb2O3  and  bromine-derived  products
[161]. The formation of SbBr3  may occur through successive dissocia-
tive additions of HBr molecules over surface Sb–O bonds in Sb2O3  fol-
lowed by water elimination steps [162].

Regarding PBDEs transformations during WPCB pyrolysis, Cai et al.
[163] investigated the mass ratios of PBDE components between emis-
sion and addition under pyrolytic conditions. A large portion of PBDEs
decomposed at ~320
C. Pyrolytic emissions of BDE183 and BDE209
were small as compared to initial quantities in the samples, with BDE209
exhibiting  a  significantly  larger  decomposition  extent.  The  emission

including BDE28, BDE71, BDE47, BDE66, BDE99, BDE85 and BDE154,
exceeded the original content in the tested materials, a finding which
was ascribed to the degradation of highly brominated species. In light of
the  decomposition  of  HBCD,  Barontini  et  al.  [164–166]  studied  its
thermal  stability  and  pyrolysis  products.  Thermal  degradation  took
◦
place in a single step at temperatures of 240–270
C. Some 75 wt% of the
bromine is released as HBr with the final residue involved in the for-
mation  of  high-molecular-weight  bromo-organic  compounds.  HBCD
decomposed by a complex mechanism involving dehydrobromination,
Diels–Alder  and  radical  reactions.  Hexa-,  penta-  and  tetrabrominated
polyaromatic structures were confirmed not to be primary products and
may only be derived from secondary radical bromination reactions.

5.3. Gasification

◦

In  contrast  to  pyrolysis,  the  aim  of  gasification  is  to  convert  the
organic fraction of WPCBs into syngas, which also has a lower impact on
the  environment  and  human  health.  However,  there  are  only  a  few
studies on WPCB gasification. As already mentioned, Li et al. [95] used
the steam atmosphere heating method to treat WPCBs. At 700
C, the
solid  residue  contained  only  0.005  wt%  of  bromine,  whereas  copper
content  reached  28.7  wt%,  enabling  its  use  in  copper  smelters.  The
amount of bromine in the oil was lower than 1 wt%, whereas in the gas
rose  to  5  wt%.  Interestingly,  up  to  94  wt%  of  bromine  ended  in  the
aqueous fraction which could be recovered. Zhu et al. [167] applied an
treat
vacuum-gasification-condensation  process
innovative
NMF-WPCBs  and  were  able  to  concentrate  bromine  in  the  flocculent
solid product (36.2 wt% of bromine) and gases (46.4 wt% of bromine).
Only  1.9  wt%  of  bromine  was  left  in  the  residue,  while  15.6  wt%  of
bromine  moved  to  the  liquid  phase.  Although  not  directly  analyzed,
bromine in the condensation oil was assimilated to Br2  while bromine
migrating to gas was assumed to be present as HBr. Other compounds

2-methylphenol.  Salbidegoitia  et  al.  [93]  conducted  the  steam  gasifi-
cation  of phenolic boards in  a ternary carbonates  medium. Hydrogen
was the main product, but tar and char formation remained an inherent
issue  for  gasification.  Zhang  et  al.  [168]  also  used  a  ternary  eutectic
carbonate in the steam gasification of epoxy circuit boards. H2 and CO2
were main gaseous products, while CH4 and CO were detected as minor
products. Li et al. [169,170] investigated the gasification behavior, re-
action kinetics and distribution of metals in the molten salt. The major
gas components were H2  and CO, constituting more than 70 % of the
total  volume.  The  main  liquid  products  were  identified  as  phenol,
2-methylphenol, 4-methylphenol and naphthalene. More than 90 % of
metals remained in the molten salt.

The only report that assessed the formation of PBDD/Fs from steam
gasification of WPCBs was published by Conesa et al. [171]. The authors
subjected three different types of copper clad laminates (FR4, CEM3 and
◦
ROGERS) to oxidative pyrolysis at 900
C in the presence of steam using
a horizontal laboratory-scale reactor. Products were mainly composed of
methane, hexane, toluene and xylene, while the production of polycyclic
aromatic  hydrocarbons  (PAHs)  and  other  semivolatile  organic  com-
pounds  was  considerably  reduced  using  iron-clay  catalysts.  PAHs
generated  in  highest  yields  included  naphthalene,  acenaphthylene,
phenanthrene and fluorene. A limited formation of brominated phenols
and dioxins was observed. The emission factor of brominated phenols
(cid:0) 1,  while  no  samples  presented  detectable
was  lower  than  5  mg  kg
amounts of toxic PBDD/Fs. Assuming the value of the detection limit for
(cid:0) 1)  is  still
all  non-detects,  the  emission  factor  for  PBDD/Fs  (210  pg  g
more than 6 times lower than that observed during WPCB combustion at
850
C in a similar reactor [160]. Ma and Kamo [172] investigated the
combination effect of steam and iron on WCPBs pyrolysis in a two-stage
reactor. 52.0 wt% oil yield was obtained, with high phenol content of
50.7  %  and  absence  of  organobromine  compounds.  The  steam-iron
combination  could  not  only  accelerate  the  dehydroxylation  of  vapor
products  but  also  promoted  debromination  reactions.  The  organo-
bromine  was  transformed  into  inorganic  bromine  and  trapped  in  the
aqueous fraction (while FeBr2 was present in the residue).

5.4. Hydrothermal processes

◦

Similarly to gasification, only a few studies have focused on the fate
of  halogens  during  hydrothermal  conversion  of  WPCBs.  Soler  et  al.
[173]  studied  the  debromination  of  WPCBs  in  subcritical  water.  As  a
result,  18.5–63.6  wt%  of  bromine  was  removed  from  the  solid  and
retained  in  the  aqueous  phase.  Xing  and  Zhang  [54]  employed
batch-type sub/supercritical water to degrade brominated epoxy resin
aiming to metal recovery. The main liquid organic phase components
included  phenol,  4-(1-methylethyl)-phenol,  2-bromo-phenol,  2-meth-
yl-phenol and 2-methyl-benzofuran. No inorganic bromine was detected
in the gaseous phase. BFRs started to decompose at increasing temper-
atures  of  200–250
C,  with  resulting  products  including  organic  bro-
mines (liquid organic phase) and inorganic (aqueous fraction). Bromine
in  the  residue  and  liquid  organic  phase  decreased  upon  a  further  in-
crease  in  temperature  to  300
C  (while  comparatively  enriched  the
aqueous phase at 350
C). Yin et al. [103] additionally probed the hy-
drothermal  decomposition  pathways  of  BFRs.  At  300
C,  the  liquid
organic  products  contained  2-bromophenol,  2,6-dibromophenol  and
temperatures
2-methyl-4-isopropyl-bromobenzene.
◦
(>360
C), these brominated substances underwent further degradation,
with phenol content significantly increasing. Liu et al. [174] proposed
an improved supercritical water system using H2O2–NaOH as additives.
The  sodium  ion  dissociated  from  NaOH  could  react  with  bromine
leading  to the formation of NaBr, while OH
underwent nucleophilic
substitution  with  bromine-containing  organic  substances  for  bromine
(cid:0)
removal. OH
could also accelerate ring opening of benzene rings and
further debromination.

6. Strategies for controlling contaminants generation

6.1. Front-end solutions

The  formation  of  bromine  derivatives  during  the  thermochemical
conversion of WPCBs is due to BFRs decomposition. Front-end solutions
can be developed to reduce bromine content before further treatment of
WPCBs. Depending on the elimination mechanisms of BFRs, debromi-
nation  methods  can  be  grouped  into  destructive  and  non-destructive
(Fig. 7 and Table 6).

1)  Destructive debromination

Destructive  debromination  can  be  achieved  by  decomposing  BFRs
during pretreatment or conversion. Ball milling involves a mechanical
process widely employed to grind materials into fine particles. Mecha-
nochemical activation can also be involved, aided by versatile activating
agents.  This  has  been  recognized  as  an  effective  technology  for  the
removal of persistent organic pollutants. Chen et al. [175] and Qin et al.
[176]  exploited  the  mechanochemical  activation  method  to  treat
NMF-WPCBs  and  validated  its  debromination  mechanism.  Using  this
method, bromine content was significantly reduced (50 %). Fe0 played
an important role as an electron donor, transferring electrons to pen-
tabromodiphenyl ether (PentaBDE). C–Br bond was stretched, lowering
the energy required for the debromination process. Cagnetta et al. [177]
reported  that  co-milling  of  Fe0,  quartz  sand  and  polypropylene  con-
taining DecaBDE ensured complete debromination and mineralization
of  BFRs.  Adding  quartz  enhanced  the  generation  of  electron-rich  sur-
faces, which contributed to the electron transfer between Fe0 and Dec-
aBDE.  Organobromine  was  transformed  into  molecular  bromide  after
ball milling. In a recent study, Liu et al. [178] proved that ferric chloride
was superior to ferric sulfate and ferric nitrate as a solid-phase reagent
for  Cu  recovery  due  to  chloride  complexation.  However,  the  fate  of
bromine  during  the  treatment  of  WPCBs  was  not  evaluated.  In  other
reports [179,180], Bi2O3 and La2O3 were used as co-milling reagents to
decompose DecaBDE, giving rise to their corresponding oxybromides,
BiOBr and LaOBr, respectively. CO2  and CO were released as gaseous
products. Wang et al. [181] investigated the effects of different additives
(MgO, Fe + SiO2, CaO) on the degradation efficiency. CaO exhibited a
better  debromination  performance  due  to  its  dual  role  as  an  electron
donor  and  bromine  acceptor.  The  free  electrons  induced  C–Br  bond
cleavage, followed by the dissociation of bromide ions and the formation
of radicals. Bromine radicals or bromide ions were combined with CaO
and formed CaBr2 [182]. Gandon-Ros et al. [183] used CaO and marble
sludge (a source of CaCO3) as additives in mechanochemical debromi-
nation.  The  treatment  achieved  a  complete  debromination  after  10  h
(more  than  95 %  in 5  h)  when  using precalcined  marble  sludge.  The
pretreatment of WPCBs using ball milling offers the advantages of ease
of operation and cost-effectiveness. However, a considerable dehaloge-
nation  performance  generally  relies  on  WPCBs  particle  size,  additive
types  and  their  amount.  The  optimization  and  behavior  modeling  of
WPCB input size could be studied, once the specific parameters affected
in the reaction system have been identified and accordingly set. Addi-
tional  agents  also  increase  the  waste  volume,  and  their  effect  on  the
subsequent thermochemical conversion was not clear. Further studies
exploring the activating agents and optimizing grinding conditions are
needed to improve dehalogenation efficiency.

Solvolysis is a method for breaking chemical bonds in the presence of
different  solvents.  A  supercritical  fluid  is  described  as  a  highly  com-
pressed fluid combining the properties of gases and liquids, which can
dissolve or break up polymers into their monomer units. Xing et al. [54]
utilized  sub/supercritical  water  to  degrade  brominated  epoxy  resin.
BFRs  initially  decomposed  at  temperatures  of  200–250

sub/supercritical  CO2  to  decompose  halogenated  compounds  from
◦
plastic waste. After heating at 200
C, bromine content was considerably
reduced, indicating that TBBPA can be easily extracted at low temper-
atures. No bromine was detected in the residue or organic solvent upon
◦
increasing  the  temperature  to 375
C.  Xiu  et  al.  [46,185] proposed  a
water-alcohol system to treat WPCBs. Up to 250
C, most bromine was
found in the form of inorganic species, while a small amount of bromine
was present in the liquid organic phase. At temperatures of 350
C and
above,  all  bromine  was  transferred  into  the  aqueous  phase  and  a
bromine-free  oil  was  obtained.  Gandon-Ros  et  al.  [186]  used  the  hy-
drothermal  process  to  treat  WPCBs,  achieving  a  debromination  effi-
ciency  of  98.9  %  at  275
C  for  4  h.  The  solvolysis  method  offers
advantages of short residence times and the organics being mineralized,
facilitating metal recovery and glass fiber in WPCBs. However, it oper-
ates  at  high  temperatures  and  is  mostly  conducted  on  a  small  scale,
limiting the volume of waste pretreatment. In addition, organobromines
are transformed into inorganic brominated compounds in oil and water,
which need to be further treated to avoid secondary pollution.

2)  Non-destructive debromination

Solvent  extraction,  also  known  as  liquid-liquid  extraction,  is  the
process employed for non-destructive debromination in which a com-
pound  transfers  from  one  solvent  to  another  owing  to  their  relative

solubilities  in  two  different  immiscible  liquids.  Zhong  et  al.  [187]
evaluated the reactivities of DecaBDE, HBCD and TBBPA with different
organic solvents. Except for diethyl ether, all solvents had high recovery
efficiencies of >94 % for three BFRs. Evangelopoulos et al. [188] used
Soxhlet extraction as a pretreatment prior to pyrolysis. Isopropanol was
assessed as being better than toluene when it came to removing bromine
from  brominated  plastics,  while  toluene  extraction  was  effective  for
WPCBs.  Pyrolysis  experiments  indicated  that  the  reduction  of  several
brominated  organic  compounds  was  achieved  and  two  brominated
compounds  (2,4,6-TBP  and  2,5-dibromobenzo(b)thiophene)  were
removed  completely.  The  solvent  extraction  features  mild  operating
conditions  and  is  easy  to  control.  However,  the  solvents  used  are
expensive and considered to be toxic, so BFRs recovery can improve the
economics of thermal processes (Table 6).

6.2. Mid-range solutions

The  efficiency  and  performance  of  formal  combustion  can  be
improved  while  controlling  pollution.  Combustion  occurs  within  the
confined space of a furnace at 1200
C with an excess air factor of 1.3
and  a  short residence  time of  0.75 s.  Bromine  present  in  WPCBs  was
almost  entirely  released  into  the  flue  gas  and  organobromine  com-
pounds  were  efficiently  destroyed  [69].  Jin  et  al.  [189]  investigated
bromine conversion at 800–1100
C. Organobromines exhibited a ten-
dency to be destroyed at higher temperatures and their conversion to

inorganic compounds in the gas phase increased from 69.0 to 96.4 %.
Ortu ̃no et al. [190] investigated the emissions during WPCBs pyrolysis
and combustion before and after metals removal. Yields of major com-
ponents HBr and Br2 made up 24–28% of the initial bromine at 600
C
and reached 32–37 % at 850
C for WPCBs. With respect to PBDD/Fs
emissions, there were no significant differences between experiments at
different temperatures in pyrolysis experiments; only total TetraBDD/Fs
exhibited  significant  differences.  Pyrolysis  at  600
C  produced  larger

Emissions  of  the  toxic  analogues  during  combustion  at  850

three times as much as in pyrolysis, while they markedly increased in the
C. In addition, adding alkali reagents during com-
combustion at 600
bustion  can  be  used  to  decompose  the  organic  halogen  compounds.
Takata et al. [191] reported the thermochemical destruction of organ-
ochlorine  (1,2,3,4-tetrachlorobenzene)  and  organobromines  (1,2,4,
5-tetrabromobenzene, TBBPA and DecaBDE) with the addition of alkali
and  alumina  in  a  combustion  system.  Dehalogenation  occurred  at  a
temperature as low as 600
C. Optimizing thermochemical conversion
parameters, for example by increasing temperatures, can alter the fate of
halogens  and  promote  the  transformation  of  organobromine  to  inor-
ganic  bromines.  Advantages
include  ease  of  operation  and
cost-effectiveness.  However,  the  dehalogenation  efficiency  can  be
limited when only this approach is used (Table 6).

Apart from controlling operating conditions, the addition of catalysts
and waste comprising metals and metal oxides to fix bromine can also be
considered a feasible solution (Fig. 8 and Table 5). Terakado et al. [192]
studied bromine fixation by means of ZnO, Fe2O3, La2O3, CaO and CuO.
Their  addition  suppressed  HBr  formation  and  the  reduction  was  esti-
mated  at  approximately  90%  and  80%  for  the  addition  of  ZnO  and
La2O3, respectively. Similar to organobromine compounds, bromophe-
nols were essentially not observed when ZnO was added. Ali et al. [161]
illustrated the efficiency of using alumina as a fixation agent for HBr
during NMF-WPCBs pyrolysis through the formation of aluminum bro-
mides  and  oxy-bromides.  Chen  et  al.  [193]  conducted  co-pyrolysis of
WPCBs with FeCl2, FeCl3 or FeSO4. A multitude of brominated organics
including 2,4-dibromophenol, 2,4,6-TBP and 2-bromo-4-methylphenol
were generated during the pyrolysis of individual WPCBs. In contrast,
liquid products were dominated by phenols and no brominated organic
compounds were detected when FeCl2 was added. Brominated organics
were  found  when  FeCl3  and  FeSO4  were  used.  Ma  and  Kamo  [194]
investigated  the  catalytic  effects  of  Fe0  and  Ni0,  ZSM-5  and

Ni/SiO2–Al2O3  on  bromine  removal.  Both  ZSM-5  and  Ni/SiO2–Al2O3
promoted  the  conversion  of  organobromine  into  HBr,  leading  to  a
decrease of bromine content in the organic liquid phase from 8.7 to 6.0
and  5.5  wt%,  respectively.  The  addition  of  Fe  particles  facilitated
bromine  removal,  resulting  in  less  than  3.8  wt%  of  bromine  being
transferred into the organic phase and more than 50% of bromine being
present  in  the  residue.  Compared  to  Ni0,  Fe  powder  exhibited  better
bromine  removal  efficiency.  Fe  particles  could  not  only  react  with
inorganically  bound  bromine  but  also  with  adsorbed  organobromine
compounds.  Wajima  et  al.  [195]  pyrolyzed  brominated  acrylonitrile
butadiene  styrene  and  reduced  halogen  content  in  the  oil  by  adding
NaOH and pine charcoal. Bromine content decreased from 3.2 to 1.7 and
to 1.3 wt% with individual reagents. Using mixed reagents, bromine was
reduced to 0.6 wt%. In light of co-pyrolysis with waste, Guan et al. [196]
probed the effects of calcium-based additives (sintered red mud, Bayer
red mud, calcium carbide dust) on bromine flux during WPCB pyrolysis.
2-bromophenol and 2-bromo-4-methyl-benzene contents were reduced.
Red  mud  showed  better  results,  which  might  be  related  to  its  higher
Fe2O3 and Na2O content. A possible neutralization between the alkaline
metal oxide and HBr in a certain temperature range could explain this
result.  Chen  et  al.  [156]  also  studied  red  mud  for  co-pyrolysis  with
NMF-WPCBs. Without the addition of a catalyst, more than 60.0 wt% of
the bromine was transferred into the gas phase and only 36.4 wt% was
fixed in the residue. 78.6 % of bromine was fixed in the residue upon the
addition of 15.0 wt% red mud. Dissociative adsorption between HBr and
metal oxides can occur if metal oxides are co-pyrolyzed with WPCBs,
resulting in the formation of stable bromine-metal bonds. In addition,
the effect of individual metal oxides was weaker than that of red mud,
indicating  the  presence  of  synergistic  effects  among  different  metals.
Zhu et al. [197] employed spent automotive catalysts with Pd content of
(cid:0) 1 for which 66.9 % debromination rate was obtained. Shi
493.9 μmol kg
et  al.  [198]  confirmed  the  feasibility  of  using  gasification  slag  to
improve debromination efficiency. With the addition of FeCl2 or FeCl3,
the debromination efficiency was only 67.2 and 58.3%. The addition of
gasification  slag  enhanced  debromination  to  81.6  and  76.3%,  respec-
tively. Results showed that the porous structure from the residual carbon
present in the gasification slag improved debromination agent loading.
Park  et  al.  [199]  conducted  the  catalytic  pyrolysis  of  WPCBs  using
natural  clays  (dolomite,  bentonite,  and  olivine)  and  HY  30  zeolite  as
catalysts.  HY  30  exhibited  the  highest  debromination  efficiency,  fol-
lowed  by  dolomite,  bentonite  and  olivine.  Results  indicated  that  the

acidity  of  the  catalyst  was  critical  for  debromination  if  the  catalyst
possessed  a  sufficiently  large  pore  size.  Zeolites  (4 A,  13X,  NAY,  and
Al-MCM-41) were reported as having a debromination effect in another
study  [200].  Large-pore  molecular  sieves  (NaY  and  13X)  had  higher
debromination  efficiency  with  respect  to  small-pore  4 A  and  meso-
porous  Al-MCM-41.  Jung  et  al.  [201]  studied  the  effects  of  three
calcium-based  additives  (CaO,  Ca(OH)2,  oyster  shells)  on  bromine
removal of brominated polystyrene. Bromine contents of oil decreased
from 5.0  to 1.3 and 2.7  wt%, respectively, when Ca(OH)2  and oyster
shells were used.

Adding catalysts during WPCBs pyrolysis or co-pyrolysis with some
feedstocks  can fix bromine in the resulting char and improve dehalo-
genation efficiency. It is worth noting that transition metal oxides can
generated relevant pollutants, most notably PXDD/Fs. Copper and iron
oxides  have  been  confirmed  to  facilitate  the  coupling  of  structurally
related precursors (e.g., polychlorinated phenols, polychlorinated ben-
zenes)  into  dioxins-related  compounds  at  moderate  temperatures
(300–500
C) [202,203]. Potter et al. [204] investigated the contribu-
tion of alumina and aluminosilicates to the formation of PCDD/Fs on fly
ashes. Results indicated that α-alumina was less active in the formation
of PCDD/Fs compared to oxides of copper and iron. The debromination
mechanism basically follows the pathway of direct abstraction of C–Br

◦

/O2(cid:0)

and dissociative adsorption of HBr, with a result of water elimination
and metal bromide formation [205]. The metal-oxygen structural pairs
(Mn+
) in these materials serve as Lewis acid-base sites, facilitating
the dissociative additions of bromine entities [206]. A carbon atom of
BFRs molecule captures an electron doublet from the O2(cid:0)
centers on the
metal oxides’ surface, thus creating a C–O bond and inducing a charge
transfer to the carbon. If the carbon is bound to a bromine atom, it will
easily  capture  the  electrons  due  to  an  enhancement  of  carbon’s  elec-
trophilicity.  The  negative  charge  is  then  transferred  from  carbon  to
bromine, further detached from the molecule as bromide [207]. Mousa
et  al.  [208]  investigated  the  decomposition  of  2,4,6-TBP  mixed  with
hematite.  Produced  species  are  highly  dominated  by  non-brominated
alkylbenzenes. XRD analysis revealed the fixation of bromine as FeBr2
in the solid residue. The primary steps for the catalytic decomposition of
2,4,6-TBP included the abstraction of aromatic C–Br or the hydroxyl’s
atoms by iron and oxygen sites in Fe2O3. In light of the debromination
mechanism for zero-valent metals, Hu et al. [209] used DFT calculations
to  study  the  debromination  mechanism  of  PBDEs  by  zero-valent  iron
(nZVI).  The  debromination  preference  was  theoretically  evaluated  as
meta-Br  > ortho-Br  > para-Br.  An  electron  transfer  mechanism  was
associated  with  this  reductive  debromination  reaction,  which  was
different from the hydrogen atom transfer for debromination of PBDEs

by  nZVI/Pd.  Furthermore,  the  addition  of  catalysts  will  increase  the
volume of generated waste while not particularly helpful for metal re-
covery. Debromination efficiency for adding Ca and Fe-based additives
is significant as compared to other metal oxides (Table 5). Adding zeo-
lites can also play the role of upgrading oil and thus increase the content
of C6–C9 hydrocarbons. However, Ca-based additives can significantly
reduce  gaseous  yields.  Balancing  debromination  efficiency  and
three-phase product yields needs to be considered in practice.

Molten salt oxidation is a thermochemical conversion process with
the  inherent  capability  of  destroying  organic  constituents  in  waste,
while retaining inorganic materials in situ. During this process, halogens
are  converted  into  acidic  gases,  which  are  then  captured  by  the  melt
[210,211]. Lin et al. [77] carried out the microwave-assisted pyrolysis of
◦
NMF-WPCBs at 400–600
C for 30 min with the addition of NaOH. The
final  distribution  of  bromine  in  the  pyrolysis  products  was  mainly
influenced  by  the  temperature  and  amount  of  NaOH.  Increasing  the
temperature and/or NaOH dose resulted in a decrease in organic phase
yield  (and  an  increase  in  gas  yield).  Additionally,  increasing  NaOH
favored  the  fixation  of  bromine  in  the  residue.  Flandinet  et  al.  [212]
used  a  KOH–NaOH  eutectic  mixture  as  a  medium  to  treat  WPCBs.
Non-metallic components were decomposed in the melt and the metallic
fraction was recovered. The gas contained ~30% hydrogen, which can
be collected as a gaseous fuel or chemical feedstock. Lin et al. [213] used
a molten salt reactor with a ternary carbonate salt to treat WPCBs. The
retention efficiency for bromine was as high as 99.9%. Wang et al. [214]
investigated the debromination efficiency in a molten NaOH–KOH me-
dium.  Here,  the  retention  was  determined  as  95.0%  for  a  NaOH/(-
NaOH–KOH) mole ratio of 0.5:1 and a temperature of 182
C. Kinetic
results revealed that nucleation and diffusion played key roles when α
was below 0.6. The salt was first spread out on the surface of WPCBs
with  the  capillary  force.  Subsequently,  bromine  atoms  reacted  with
metal  ions  and  donated  electrons  to  them,  resulting  in  C–Br  bond
cleavage.  Finally,  the  bromine  radical  was  bonded  to  the  hydroxyl
radical  forming  HBr,  which  was  retained  by  the  alkalis.  Molten  salt
technology  is  a  robust  thermal  but  non-flame  process,  offering  many
advantages over incineration. However, periodic disposal of the spent
salt is required to achieve continuous operation, which may limit waste
treatment volume and adds to process costs.

Some authors [86,215] also suggested using biomass as feedstock in
a  co-pyrolysis  to  achieve  debromination.  Biomass  has  a  greater  H/C
ratio  (>1.5)  as  compared  to  WPCBs,  making  it  a  potential  hydrogen
donor  in  the  pyrolysis  reaction.  This  is  helpful  for  inhibiting  the  for-
mation of PBDD/Fs, assisting in reducing bromine content in the organic
phase while directing brominated compounds to the produced char. Ma
et  al.  [216]  reported  that  the  co-pyrolysis  of  WPCBs  with  waste  tires
favored bromine capture into the char. During co-pyrolysis, the inter-
action between bromine and olefinic radicals accelerated the debromi-
nation of primary brominated compounds. The resulting HBr could react
with ZnO and CaO present in the tire ash.

loaded  with

fuel  without  corrosion  issues  [223].  Sakata  et  al.  [224]  developed  a
two-step process for the dehalogenation of brominated mixed plastics.
The  first  step  was  converting  the  mixed  plastics  into  tar  containing
approximately 2000 ppm of organochlorine compounds. In the second
step, dechlorination was performed in a fixed-bed reactor. The tar was
cleaned  using  quartz  wool-beds
iron  oxide  and
calcium-based  catalysts.  Halogen-free  tars  can  be  used  as  a  fuel  or
feedstock in refineries. Vasile et al. [225] upgraded liquid products from
the pyrolysis of plastics and computer thermoset fractions using cata-
lytic hydrogenation. The effect of hydrogenation was improved by using
a  catalyst  from commercial  hydrogenation  (DHC-8)  and  metal-loaded
activated carbon. Halogens were removed mainly by converting them
into gaseous HCl and HBr. Halogen acid gases generated during WPCB
decomposition  can be  easily  absorbed by  alkali  solutions, such  as  so-
dium hydroxide or sodium carbonate solutions. This is a simple, easy to
use step and a good complement to other thermochemical conversion
processes. The problem is that the off-gas decontamination efficiency is
mainly determined by the previous treatment process applied to WPCBs.
The more organobromines have been transformed into inorganic bro-
mines,  the  higher  dehalogenation  efficiency.  Both  catalytic  dehaloge-
nation and catalytic hydrogenation can be used in oil refineries. These
processes are complex and catalysts are needed to decompose organo-
bromine into inorganic bromines. In addition, their scope of application
is limited. Investigating suitable catalysts or designing catalysts based on
studies of the dehalogenation mechanism may improve the dehaloge-
nation efficiency.

6.3. End-of-pipe solutions

7. Conclusions

End-of-pipe solutions are designed to treat gaseous and tar products
upon  generation.  From  previous  analysis,  halogens  in  off-gas  mainly
correspond  to  HBr.  Similarly  to  CaO  solutions  for  water  used  in  gas
desulfurization in power plants, alkali solutions can be used to capture
bromine  before  its  emission  (Fig.  9).  Samples  were  combusted  and
gaseous  bromine  species  were  captured  in  an  alkaline  solution  con-
taining H2O2  [195]. In their product analysis arising from the decom-
position of BFRs, Xing and Zhang [54] introduced nitrogen to push the
gas away from the reactor, while a NaHCO3 solution was used to capture
HBr. The bromine present in the organic phase can limit its refinement
and  subsequent  utilization  as  a  fuel.  Further  debromination  can  be
achieved  by  adding  sodium  vapor  to  the  gas  flow,  similarly  to  the
Degussa process, in which bromine was removed within a few minutes.
The tar with a bromine content of less than 2000 ppm can be utilized as

Waste printed circuit boards (WPCBs) are one of the most rapidly
increasing waste streams. Thermochemical conversion of WPCBs offers
the  advantages  of  volume  reduction  and  energy  recovery  as  well  as
metal enrichment in the residue. The combustion process can be mainly
grouped into pyrolytic decomposition with char formation and subse-
quent char combustion stages, providing some of the energy required for
the metallurgical recycling processes. Peak temperatures were found at
about 300–400
C and the Ea  values were determined in the range of
(cid:0) 1.  For  WPCBs  pyrolysis,  different  reactions  were
50–300  kJ  mol
involved, including polymer decomposition, free radical reactions, sec-
ondary cracking reactions and depolymerization reactions. The yield of
three-phase products was generally determined to be ca. 20 wt% for tar,
10 wt% for gas and 70 wt% for char, being perceptibly influenced by
temperature, residence time and reactor type. FWO method was more

reliable for kinetic analysis purposes and second-order reactions were
well described for WPCB decomposition. Gasification of WPCBs is most
efficiently performed under eutectic salt medium (H2 and CO2 as major
products), with gasification performance influenced by multiple factors
including reaction temperature, pressure, waste particle size, steam-to-
waste ratio and catalysts use.

◦

Hydrothermal  processes  include  hydrolysis  at  lower  temperatures
and pyrolysis at higher temperatures. Resins in WPCBs are decomposed
into  phenol  at  300
C  and  above.  Currently,  there  is  a  gap  in  the
knowledge  regarding  their  reaction  kinetics  and  applied  models  are
mostly based on the Arrhenius equation. Disadvantages of this approach
include  scale-up  reactor  limitations  and  insufficient  technology
maturity.

WPCBs  contain  significant  amounts  of  metals  and  flame-retardant
epoxy  resins,  which  result  in  the  volatilization of  metals  and  the  for-
mation of bromine-containing products. Uncontrolled combustion will
result  in  the  release  of  metal-rich  particulate  matter,  e.g.,  with  high
concentrations of Pb, Cu, Zn, Ni, and Cr. Toxic pollutants such as PXDD/
Fs are also generated. During WPCB pyrolysis, BFRs are transformed into
gaseous and liquid products, including HBr, bromobenzene, 2-bromo-4-
chloro-phenol,
bromoethane,
1-(bromomethyl)-4-methylbenzene,
methyl  bromide,  dibromophenol  and  bromophenol.  The  bromine  in
residue was mainly observed in the form of FeBr3 and SbBr3, although
the CuBr or CuBr2  was also detected in some conditions. Under gasifi-
cation conditions, bromine was primarily distributed into liquid prod-
ucts  in  the  organic  phase  such  as  phenol,  2-methylphenol,  4-
methylphenol and naphthalene, in a similar way to that of hydrothermal
processes.

To avoid or at least significantly reduce pollutants emission during
WPCB  decomposition,  the  front-end,  mid-range  and  end-of-pipe  solu-
tions can be introduced a number of which including ball milling, sub/
supercritical  fluid  techniques,  solvent  extractions,  controlling  opera-
tional  conditions  catalyst  and  alkali  addition,  etc.  were  detailed  and
discussed. There are still several gaps in the landscape of fundamental
knowledge and design of thermochemical conversion of WPCBs, thus the
conclusions are followed by an outlook on future research directions.

8. Future research, directions and prospects

Most studies on thermochemical conversion of WPCBs, covering the
pyrolysis process, have been performed at laboratory scale. Further in-
vestigations  are  needed  to  turn  the  results  of  these  studies  into  com-
mercial reality. The following recommendations can be made based on
these future research directions.

1)  Open  burning  of  e-waste  can  still  be  found  in  some  developing
countries, which generates severe pollution and represents a threat
to  public  health.  To  crack  down  on  illegal  e-waste  exports  and
treatments, information must be provided on formal regulatory and
enforcement  actions.  In  addition,  further  studies  on  the  formation
mechanism of PBDD/Fs using the DFT method and particulate matter
emissions should be conducted, enabling combustion facilities and
operating conditions to be designed and optimized. A combination of
pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical processing is a promising
process and can be conducted in large-scale industrial practice.
2)  The  pyrolysis  behavior  of  WPCBs  has  been  extensively  studied.
However, the bromine evolution was not entirely clear. There are no
conforming  results  for  the  interaction  between  Cu  and  bromine.
Thermodynamics and reaction kinetics have also not been compre-
hensively investigated and it is difficult to reach a reliable conclu-
sion.  More  kinetic  models,  especially  for  co-pyrolysis,  need  to  be
established and validated, then put into practice to offer reference
cases for future reactor design. The metallic and organic components
of WPCBs are a complex mixture and the metals present in WPCBs
have  exhibited  significant  effects  on  the  pyrolysis  behavior  that
should  be  further  studied.  This  is  helpful  for  the  strategy  of

dismantling WPCBs and other separation processes. Many catalysts
have  been  added  during  WPCB  pyrolysis,  but  the  relationship  be-
tween catalyst properties and dehalogenation efficiency has not been
consistently investigated. Further studies on dehalogenation mech-
anisms should be conducted as a basis for the bottom-up preparation
of catalysts. The combination of steam and catalysts in a two-stage
reactor  can  be  further  probed  to  improve  debromination  rate  and
quality of gas and liquid phase products. In addition, the downstream
products of the pyrolysis process are diverse, so an effective use and
refining of resulted three-phase products is key to pyrolysis.

3)  There are only a few studies on the gasification of WPCBs. Studies
examining how gasifying agents, co-gasification and the components
and  amounts  of  molten  salt  affect  product  distribution  and  yield
should be further pursued. Their thermodynamics and reaction ki-
netics  should  also  be  investigated.  Additionally,  an  economic
assessment should be conducted for the transition to industrial-scale
processes,  including  the  source  of  raw  materials,  recycling  and
treatment of molten salts, usage of gas and separation of metals and
glass fiber.

4)  Regarding the  hydrothermal process,  the development of  effective
catalysts  to  reduce  the  process  temperature  and  treat  the  liquid
products should be further investigated. To guide research towards
commercialization, environmental and economic-technical analysis
is mandatory to explore the feasibility of this process.

5)  To  reduce  the  pollution/contaminants  generated  during  WPCBs
decomposition,  front-end  solutions  should  be  strengthened  and
novel solvents and simple operations should be developed to reduce
BFRs formation and emissions. From mid-range solution, novel cat-
alysts  should  be  developed  by  bottom-up  approaches  and  the  dis-
tribution and yield of pyrolysis products should be predicted using
artificial neural networks. How to balance debromination efficiency
and three-phase products yields needs to be taken into consideration.
In  addition,  char-containing  fixed  halogens  should  be  further
improved to increase its economic value.
