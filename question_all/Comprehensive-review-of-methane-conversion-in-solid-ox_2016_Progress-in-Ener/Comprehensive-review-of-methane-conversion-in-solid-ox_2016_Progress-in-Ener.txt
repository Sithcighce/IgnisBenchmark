Natural gas is an important energy resource for electric power generation and other energy needs. Recent
discoveries of vast reserves of shale gas greatly increased its abundance while lowering its cost. Com-
bined with its significantly smaller carbon-footprint than coal, natural gas has increasingly become the
preferred choice to generate electrical power even at the expense of converting existing coal fired power
plants to run on natural gas. However, most natural gas combustion-based power plants currently operate
at efficiencies in the low 30%. Conversion of natural gas in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) promises to in-
crease system level conversion efficiencies to above 60%, doubling the current efficiencies and significantly
reducing the CO2 emissions by a factor of 2. Such dramatic improvements in conversion efficiency and
ease of CO2 capture are currently out of reach for the combustion-based power generation technolo-
gies. Equally importantly, the CO2 produced from methane conversion leaves the fuel cell in a highly
concentrated form. As nitrogen is blocked off by the impervious ceramic electrolyte of the SOFC from
entering the process stream, methane oxidation produces a flue stream that is primarily made of the
oxidation products CO2 and steam. The latter can easily be condensed out to capture CO2, thus elimi-
nating the need for expensive and energy intensive post separation operations otherwise required to separate
CO2 from N2 for storage purposes. So if successfully developed and deployed widely, natural gas conver-
sion in SOFCs will greatly reduce CO2 emissions, help mitigate climate change, and minimize the
environmental impact of power generation.

This article organizes and critically reviews the current state of understanding in methane catalysis
and oxidation with particular emphasis for electrochemical conversion in SOFCs. It presents a compre-
hensive review of a vast volume of published work (>600 references) extending from fundamental studies
in C—H bond activation and methane catalysis to basic concepts of electrochemical conversion in fuel
cells, to strategies for effective utilization of methane in SOFCs, and associated technical difficulties such
as deactivation due to sulfur and carbon yet to be overcome for realizing natural gas conversion, to impactful
opportunities provided by recent theoretical advances in computational catalysis and materials screen-
ing studies, and innovative concepts such as strain effects and nanostructuring toward enhancing catalytic
rates. It provides tutorial-type information at the appropriate level for the uninitiated but interested reader
as well as critical discussions of fundamental phenomena and assessment of recent advances for active
researchers in the field. The article is weighted around materials and surface properties and provides
an in-depth review with emphasis on electronic structure, charge transport and catalysis. It presents an
impartial evaluation of the opportunities as well as the challenges to natural gas utilization in SOFCs.
Finally, it concludes that natural gas conversion in SOFCs promises very attractive opportunities for ef-
ficient and environmentally friendly power generation, while recognizing and offering in-depth discussions
of the challenges facing this technology before it can be considered for large-scale power generation
applications.

1. Background

Natural gas makes up a significant segment of the global energy
portfolio and is rapidly becoming the preferred fuel for thermo-
electric power generation partly because of its relatively lower carbon
intensity compared to other fossil fuels such as coal and oil. In the
U.S., natural gas makes up more than 27% of our energy consump-
tion (see Fig. 1). As the least carbon-intensive fossil fuel with
abundant reserves, especially after the recent finds of shale gas res-
ervoirs in the U.S. and around the world, natural gas may serve as
the “bridge fuel” during the next several decades to transition into
a low-carbon energy economy. Indeed, its share in global electric
power generation is expected to increase from 22% in 2010 to 24%
in 2040 [1]. It is also expected that the installed capacity for natural
gas-based power generation will increase more than 50% during this
period.

By all accounts, fossil fuels are expected to dominate both energy
consumption and electricity production at the global scale. Table 1
compares the global installed and actual production statistics for
electric power generation [3]. Electricity generation relies heavily
on fossil fuels, which provide more than 2/3rd of the global elec-
tricity that was generated and consumed in 2012, while the
renewable energies such as wind and solar provide only a small frac-
tion. Also note the expected discrepancy between the installed
capacity and actual production for wind and solar due to the in-
termittency of these sources, while electricity production from fossil
fuel and nuclear plants are significantly higher than installed ca-
pacity share, demonstrating their availability and reliability.

A complementary cut with growth projections by the U.S. Energy
Information Administration is presented in Table 2, which summa-
rizes the 2008 global installed capacities for six prominent power

generation technologies and their expected capacities in 2035 [4].
It shows that the total electricity production is expected to in-
crease 1.7% annually from 4623 GW in 2008 to 7272 GW in 2035.
The table also highlights the large investments expected for non-
OECD countries in all forms of power generation technologies to meet
the demand for electricity to catch up rapidly with OECD (i.e., Or-
ganization for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries.
Table 2 also clearly indicates that fossil-based power generation will
likely dominate global electricity production for decades to come,
where wind and solar electricity, albeit their rapid growth rates, are

expected to provide only about 9% of the total installed capacity col-
lectively by 2035 with much of that growth happening in wind
power generation.

Natural gas-based power generation clearly offers greater ben-
efits in terms of less environmental damage, smaller carbon footprint
and lower emissions to the atmosphere when compared to coal-
based power generation. The 2013 International Energy Outlook
report concludes that natural gas will be the fastest growing fossil
fuel resource, and predicts that the global consumption will in-
crease 64% from 113 trillion cubic feet (tcf) in 2010 to 185 tcf in
2040 [1]. Much of this increase in both production and demand
comes from rapidly developing non-OECD countries, which will
account for more than 72% of this increase and attain a 59% share
in global consumption of natural gas in 2040, from 51% in 2010 [1].
As the world’s largest consumer and producer of natural gas, the
U.S. consumption is projected to increase by 5.8 tcf in 2040 and is
predicted to produce nearly 34 tcf of natural gas in 2040, up from
21.5 tcf in 2010. Much of this production increase is due to the recent
discoveries of vast shale gas reserves in the U.S. as well as in other
places around the planet. A 2013 Energy Information Administra-
tion (EIA) report assessed 137 shale formations in 41 countries and
estimated the global recoverable shale gas resources to be 7299 tcf
[6]. Although concerns about the long term environmental impact
of hydraulic fracturing (i.e., fracking) are still debated, abundant shale
gas resources of natural gas can help meet the energy needs of the
growing economies of the world in a cost effective manner. The
Henry Hub natural gas spot price, which averaged $3.73/MMBtu in
2013 and $4.46/MMBtu in 2014, is expected to average $3.87/
MMBtu in 2015 [7]. The slightly higher natural gas prices in 2014
reduced natural gas consumption in the U.S. thermoelectric power
sector by 2% to 21.9 Bcf per day, but this number is expected to in-
crease to 22 Bcf per day in 2015 due to more favorable prices for
natural gas.

Currently, natural gas accounts for nearly 26% of the primary
energy consumed in the U.S. and was responsible for 27% of the U.S.

electricity generation in 2013. More importantly, the abundance,
low cost, and low carbon intensity of natural gas have fueled a
renewed interest and growing increase in its share in thermoelec-
tric power production in the U.S. and globally as well (see Fig. 2).
Much of this is the result of retiring or in some cases, converting
coal fired power generation capacity and building up natural gas
power generation instead. Between 2005 and 2012, while 496
billion kWh of coal fired power generation capacity was retired in
the U.S., this was replaced by an increase of 470 billion kWh in
natural gas based power generation capacity [8]. This is despite the
fact that on unit energy basis, coal remains to be considerably
cheaper than natural gas. The average prices of coal for thermo-
electric power generation were $2.39/MMBtu in 2011, $2.35/
MMBtu in 2013, and $2.36/MMBtu in 2014, which is expected to
continue unchanged in 2015 [7]. In a way, the increasing rate at
which coal fired plants are being converted to natural gas is a tes-
tament of the environmental concerns and downhill costs that
outweigh price considerations in favor of natural gas power
generation.

The most widely employed natural gas-based electric genera-
tion process consists of a steam generation unit, where natural gas
is combusted in air inside a boiler that produces steam that turns
a turbine to generate electricity. However, conversion efficiencies
using steam generators are rather low. U.S. Energy Information Ad-
ministration (EIA) statistics based on actual testing of heat rates in
operating power plants in the U.S. averaged around 10,350–
10,400 Btu/kWh during the 2007 and 2012 periods [9]. This
corresponds to a conversion efficiency of only 32.85%. Similarly, con-
version efficiencies derived from tested heat rates of major power
generation technologies are summarized in Table 3 for compari-
son. The numbers clearly indicate inherent inefficiencies in these
conversion technologies. It should be noted that the correspond-
ing efficiency values estimated by the World Energy Council are
significantly higher than the actually measured efficiency values pub-
lished by U.S. EIA, and places the global average efficiency for natural
gas-fired power generation at 40.6%, while the U.S. average is shown
even higher at 47.9% in 2013 [10]. The reason for such large dis-
crepancies in the efficiency values reported by the two reputable
organizations is not clear. As the nature of how the latter data are
collected, processed and evaluated by the World Energy Council is
unknown, actual measured efficiency data published by the U.S. EIA
and presented in Table 3 are accepted to be the more reliable source
for this article.

Natural gas-fired combustion turbines are also employed for
power generation, especially for meeting peak demands, although
their average capacity factors, i.e., their availability, are quite low
(~10–27%) and they contribute only a small percentage to total gen-
eration (3% of the total electricity generated in 2012 [11]).

Combined-cycle gas turbines provide higher efficiencies reported-
ly up to 55%, but the average actually achieved in 2012 was only
44.8% (see Table 3).

Natural gas combustion releases nearly 1/2 the amount of CO2
than coal power generation. This provides a significant incentive and
advantage for natural gas-based electricity generation. Indeed, a
recent article assessing the climate benefits of natural gas- versus
coal-based power generation reported that over the long run gas-
fired plants present significantly greater benefits for mitigating
climate change than coal-fired plants [12]. Likewise, recent har-
monization [13] studies by the U.S. DOE–National Renewable Energy
Laboratory (NREL) on life cycle analyses of green house gas (GHG)
emissions of different power generation technologies [14] esti-
mated median values of 470 g (CO2)eq/kWh for the combined average
of all different natural gas conversion technologies [13] versus 1000 g
(CO2)eq/kWh for the average of all coal power generation [15]. In
either case, however, combustion of the fuel in air inevitably pro-
duces flue gases that contain diluted quantities of CO2 (5–15%) in
vast amounts of N2 that necessitate expensive and energy inten-
sive post-separation operations for CO2 capture.

As stringent emission standards especially for CO2 is expected
eventually to go into effect around the world, there will be in-
creased demand in developing advanced and efficient technologies
for conversion of natural gas into electricity with total carbon capture.
In this regard, electrochemical conversion in solid oxide fuel cells
(SOFC) offers great opportunities to meet efficiency and emission
requirements. Most reserves are geographically separated by long
distances from populated markets or high volume industrial cus-
tomers in Europe, Asia and other places that require transportation
of natural gas to points of use, which can add $3.00–5.00/MMBtu
on top of the cost of production [16]. Leakage of CH4 from natural
gas production sources and other industrial or biological activities
may have significant impact on climate change, as CH4 has 21 times
the global warming potential (GWP) as CO2 over a 100-year horizon
[2]. In fact, a recent study estimated that the total amount of CH4
leaking into the atmosphere from all accounted sources in North
America is between 7 and 21 × 1012 g/year [17]. On-site utilization
and conversion of natural gas can mitigate or minimize many of these
concerns. Indeed, SOFCs are ideally suited for distributed power gen-
eration at the point of production offering significant cost and
environmental benefits.

2. Introduction

This article is motivated by renewed interest in natural gas for
power generation, which in part is propelled by the recent discov-
eries of vast reserves of shale gas in the U.S. [18] and around world,
as well as due to the inherently lower carbon footprint for natural
gas compared to liquid and solid carbonaceous fuels such as oil and
coal. The high H/C ratio of nearly 4 for natural gas, as opposed to
that for oil (H/C ~ 2) or coal (H/C ~ 1), translates into much larger
amounts of energy generated per unit quantity of CO2 released into
the environment upon combustion. Natural gas is a critically im-
portant primary energy source, fuel and chemical feedstock for a
wide range of industrial and societal needs, and especially for elec-

tricity generation. Nearly 75% of the hydrogen produced globally
is derived from steam reforming of natural gas in large-scale cen-
tralized plants. After proper adjustment of the CO/H2 ratio, the
reformation product syngas can subsequently be utilized to make
higher hydrocarbons via Fischer–Tropsch synthesis [19,20]. Natural
gas is also employed as the starting fuel for many of the fuel cell
systems after it is reformed to syngas or water–gas shifted primar-
ily to H2, which is then used as the fuel for various types of fuel cells.
Due to its low cost, natural abundance, and low emissions natural
gas is also a critical and desirable fuel for electricity production.
However, most conventional power generation technologies in-
cluding those that are based on natural gas are not efficient as
indicated in Table 3, which presents actual measured perfor-
mance data from power plants. While the three conventional
technologies, namely, coal and natural gas combustion, and nuclear,
have efficiencies in the low 30%, only combined cycle technology
offers moderate efficiencies around 45%. Clearly, there is a great need
to develop advanced technologies that provide significantly higher
efficiencies for natural gas-to-electricity conversion. Compared to
the thermoelectric power generation technologies employed today,
solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) offer the highest conversion efficiency
along with other environmental benefits, and can play a critical role
in our energy R&D strategy [21]. Due to its relatively high operat-
ing temperatures, SOFCs also offer exceptional fuel flexibility [22]
unsurpassed by any other fuel cell systems for direct utilization of
a wide range of fuels, and even switching sequentially from one hy-
drocarbon fuel to the next in real time with great ease [23]. Examples
of such fuel diversity and flexibility include gaseous hydrocarbons
such as alkanes [24–27], and dimethyl ether [28], liquid fuels such
as octane [29] toluene, diesel and n-decane [30], vegetable oil [31],
jet fuel and crude oil [32], as well as solid fuels such as activated
carbon [33,34], biomass [35], and untreated coal [36].

Likewise, SOFCs are ideally suited for methane conversion not
only into electricity but also to syngas or higher hydrocarbons. There
are various ways these outcomes can be accomplished. For com-
bustion and coupling reactions of methane, ceramic membrane
reactors can be employed and these may be either mixed ionically
electronically conducting (MIEC) [37–41] or primarily ionically con-
ducting membranes [42,43]. Conversion in MIEC membranes is
primarily a chemical process driven by the chemical potential dif-
ference of oxygen across the membrane, where the electrons as well
as either oxide ions or protons may diffuse across the membrane
to accomplish the desired chemical reaction of oxygenation or de-
hydrogenation. Another approach to produce electricity and
chemicals consists of employing an electrochemical reactor that uti-
lizes a proton conducting solid electrolyte in a SOFC configuration,
where the methane transformation reactions are dominated by
proton extraction [44–47]. Both of these schemes, namely, MIEC
ceramic membrane reactors and electrochemical reactors based on
protonically conducting solid oxide electrolyte membranes, fall
outside the scope of this review article and will not be covered here.
Likewise, natural gas combustion processes including chemical
looping combustion [48–50], oxy-combustion [51,52], and propul-
sion [53] will not be covered here as they fall outside the scope of
this article. However, relevant aspects of catalytic combustion will

be discussed briefly below, but only in the context of chemical ki-
netics of methane oxidation over precious metal and oxide catalysts.
This article will primarily focus on SOFC approaches that employ
oxide ion conducting solid electrolytes for electrochemical utiliza-
tion of methane for electricity generation only. The potential benefits
as well as challenges to electrochemical conversion in SOFCs as
opposed to chemical combustion processes will be highlighted in
the proceeding sections, and recent advances and progress will be
discussed in detail.

Understanding the mechanistic details and technical chal-
lenges of methane conversion in SOFCs is the logical first step toward
realizing natural gas utilization in SOFCs for electricity genera-
tion. Methane chemistry is rich as it can undergo many reactions
[54,55]. Several of the industrially important net reactions perti-
nent to this article and the associated enthalpy changes are listed

In the reaction environment at the SOFC anode, it is possible that
several of these reactions may compete or proceed concurrently.
Methane conversion to electricity in SOFCs can be accom-
plished primarily in three different ways, namely, via external or
internal reforming through reactions (3) and (4), or by direct electro-
oxidation, i.e., reaction (1). External or internal reforming process
produces a mixture of H2 and CO, i.e., syngas that is subsequently
oxidized at the SOFC anode. Direct oxidation, however, is a dis-
tinctly different
to achieve
electrochemically. It requires fundamental understanding and de-
velopment of electrocatalytic anode materials that selectively
promote direct electro-oxidation of methane in SOFCs. This article
offers a critical review of methane utilization in SOFCs, and dis-
cusses the prospects, opportunities as well as technical challenges
to efficient conversion of natural gas to electricity.

reaction and more difficult

The first logical step toward utilization and conversion of natural
the
gas in SOFCs requires mechanistic understanding of
electrocatalytic oxidation of methane, as it is the principal constit-
uent of natural gas, which contains up to 90% CH4 with CO2, N2 and
other impurity gases making up the remaining. Electrochemical con-
version in SOFCs, however, presents its own set of technical
challenges, many of which will be addressed in this article. One dif-
ficult challenge relates to the natural occurrence of sulfurous species
in natural gas, usually in the form of H2S, which cause rapid deac-
tivation of the catalytic anode. Another one is presented by coking,
or carbon deposition on catalytic surfaces, which blocks off access
to surface active sites from the reacting species, causing deactiva-

tion of the catalytic activity of the anode and subsequent degradation
of cell performance. In addition, there are also demanding require-
ments related to materials stability issues at the high operating
temperatures of SOFCs and under steep chemical potential gradi-
ents across cell components produced by the strongly oxidizing gas
environment typically in the form of air at the cathode, while the
anode is in direct contact with a highly reducing environment due
to the presence of the fuel. Furthermore, cost and lifetime issues
for economic competitiveness and practical applications pose ad-
ditional challenges. Most of these issues are addressed and discussed
in the proceeding sections.

This review article is organized to present the interested readers
both tutorial level background material to introduce them into fuel
cell-based electrochemical conversion systems and materials as well
as the fundamental aspects of methane catalysis, electrocatalysis,
reforming and conversion in SOFCs. It provides a critical review of
the progress made in these areas, identify the knowledge gaps, and
discuss strategic approaches and opportunities to bridge and over-
come technical difficulties. It should be noted that the article is
primarily focused on methane conversion for the purpose of elec-
tricity generation in SOFCs, and will not cover areas related to co-
generation and synthesis of chemicals from methane or natural gas.
Basic concepts of surface science and catalysis will be presented in
this context along with an adequate review of SOFC materials fo-
cusing heavily on catalytic anodes. The latter part of this article will
discuss major technical and scientific challenges and key hurdles
yet to be overcome in order for natural gas conversion in SOFCs can
be realized for wide scale practical applications. The article will also
present important opportunities that are offered by new theoret-
ical, experimental, and analytical tools for advancing the current
state-of-the-art into better mechanistic understanding to methane
catalysis, as well as catalyst design and discovery. Finally, pros-
pects of natural gas conversion in SOFCs and the outlook of this
exciting approach into the future will be discussed.

2.1. Environmental benefits of electrochemical conversion

Electrochemical conversion of natural gas to electricity in SOFCs
offers inherently higher efficiencies than possible by conventional
thermoelectric power generation technologies. It also produces a
flue stream that is highly concentrated in CO2 and, hence, is easy
to capture, as nitrogen is blocked from entering the process stream
by the impervious dense solid electrolyte membrane of the fuel cell.
So no post-separation operation to capture CO2 will be necessary.
Conversion in SOFCs also offers environmentally friendly and noise-
less operation as well as portability and modularity suitable for both
distributed or central production of electricity. In addition, SOFCs
exhibit their highest efficiency at low loads in contrast to gas tur-
bines, which normally exhibit high efficiency only at high loads.
Moreover, the highly exothermic nature of methane oxidation re-
action provides high quality waste heat from the SOFC that opens
up opportunities for combined heat and power generation, which
gives rise to improved efficiencies. In summary, electrocatalytic
methane conversion in SOFCs offers the following benefits:

– High conversion efficiencies exceeding 60%
– Correspondingly lower CO2 emissions per unit of power generated
– Capture-ready CO2 production, as no nitrogen enters the process

stream

– Significantly lower NOx production due to moderate SOFC

temperatures

- Isothermal conversion process simplifies plant design and lowers

cost

- No need for water, if steam reforming is not involved (as in direct

oxidation)

- Environmentally friendly conversion (no noise, no moving parts,

small footprint)

- Modular process well suited for distributed generation

It is important to note that low efficiencies of chemical com-
bustion processes typically carried out using air as the oxygen source
also pose major environmental problems in the form of heavily
diluted CO2 emissions (~5%, balance mostly N2) that makes it dif-
ficult and expensive to capture CO2, as well as produce NOx and SOx,
whose formation are favored by the high operating temperatures
typically employed in combustion processes. It should be noted that
both CH4 and NOx are extremely potent greenhouse gases, whose
global warming potentials over 100 years are significantly greater
than for CO2 [56] as shown in Table 4.

By contrast, electrochemical conversion of methane in SOFCs
offers the prospects of dramatically reducing total emissions into
the atmosphere by significantly increasing the conversion efficien-
cy and producing capture ready CO2 that will help reduce the carbon
footprint on the environment. Certainly, lowering the SOFC oper-
ating temperature for methane conversion will also be beneficial,
and the strategies and advances made to date to achieve this goal
will also be discussed in this article.

2.2. Efficiency of direct electrochemical oxidation

Combustion processes involve the chemical reaction of the fuel
with oxygen. The latter can be supplied to the fuel in various ways,
but most commonly via the use of air. Driven primarily by the ob-
jective to achieve effective capture of the combustion product and
green house gas CO2, recent developments in combustion tech-
nologies explore metal oxides as the oxygen carrier in chemical
looping [48–50], or oxygen in pure molecular form as in oxy-
combustion [51]. Most often, however, air is employed for the oxygen
source, which means nitrogen too is carried into the process stream
as a passive diluent. This is undesirable for obvious reasons includ-
ing loss of efficiency due to the latent heating and cooling losses
of huge volumes of a practically inert gas, difficulty in separating
it from the combustion product gas CO2 for capture, and the ten-
dency to produce NOx. More specifically, N2O formed during
combustion is a deleterious green house gas that is 310 times more
potent than CO2 in trapping infrared radiation from the earth’s
surface. Consequently, when air is used as the oxygen source, the
presence of N2 in the flue gas stream will require expensive and
energy intensive post-separation processes in order to capture the
CO2. The exothermic enthalpy change during the combustion re-
action is transferred to a suitable medium such as steam, which turns
a turbine that is connected to a generator that produces electrici-
ty. The efficiency of this thermal conversion process is rather low
as indicated in Table 3.

By contrast, electrochemical conversion of methane in SOFCs
offers inherently higher conversion efficiencies. The theoretical ef-
ficiency, η, for electrochemical conversion is defined simply by
η = ΔG°/ΔH°, where the Gibbs free energy change, ΔG°, represents
the maximum possible work available for the conversion process
while ΔH° denotes the enthalpy change for the same. For conver-
sion processes where the reaction entropy losses are small, examples
including direct oxidation reactions of carbon or methane, excep-

hydrogen, and carbon monoxide.

tionally high theoretical efficiencies are possible. Another advantage
of electrochemical conversion is that it occurs isothermally, sim-
plifying process flow and minimizing energy losses otherwise
associated with chemical processes, which usually require multi-
ple heating and cooling cycles.

The net cell reaction (1) is thermodynamically downhill with a
Gibbs free energy change, ΔG°298K = −799 kJ/mol of CH4, which rep-
resents the maximum work potential for this reaction. Due to the
negligibly small entropy change (ΔS°298K = −1.3 J/K.mol of O2) during
the methane oxidation reaction, the free energy change is also iden-
tical to the highly exothermic methane combustion reaction with
the enthalpy change, ΔH°298K = −801 kJ/mol of CH4. Consequently, this
provides an exceptionally high ceiling of 100% for the theoretical
conversion efficiency of electrochemical oxidation of methane, which
also is significantly higher than for the typical and preferred SOFC
fuel H2, as shown in Fig. 3.

By comparison, thermal conversion of methane for electricity gen-
eration using steam or combustion turbines in the conventional way
involves many process steps and also offers quite low efficiencies
around 30% (see Table 3). It is clear SOFCs can accomplish electric-
ity generation in a single process step with nearly twice the
conversion efficiency of conventional thermoelectric power tech-
nologies. In fact, product sheets from the commercial SOFC developer
and manufacturer Bloom Energy of California, U.S., indicate 52–
60% system level conversion efficiencies – based on lower heating
value (LHV) – for their 200 kW and 250 kW commercial SOFC units
running on reformed natural gas [57].

3. Catalysis of methane oxidation

As expected from the sp3 hybridization of the C—H bond, methane
is a tetrahedrally coordinated molecule with 3-dimensional sym-
metry. It has a high ionization potential (12.5 eV) and low electron
affinity (4.4 eV). Compared to higher alkanes, the C—H bonds in
methane are exceptionally stable with bond energy of 435 kJ/mol.
Hence, the high C—H bond strength and the directionality of the
sp3 orbital make it difficult for methane to form bonds with other
species or with catalytic surfaces. This provides a barrier to acti-
vate the C—H bond and for methane to react under mild conditions.
For this reason, high temperatures and effective catalysts are re-
quired to activate and transform methane into useful chemicals,
products, or electricity.

The oxidation of methane, especially partial oxidation toward
producing higher value added fuels and chemicals, has been studied
extensively for nearly a century. There is rich literature on the wide
range of catalytic reactions that methane can undergo, including
interactions and oxidation kinetics on metal [58–61] and oxide

surfaces [62,63], combustion [61,64–67], partial oxidation
[59,62,68–73], as well as oxidative coupling [74–78], and conver-
sion to useful chemicals [79–84]. Usually, non-selective oxidation
takes place when methane and molecular oxygen are co-fed onto
the reactor. The design and control of the properties of the cata-
lyst as well as the optimization of the reaction conditions are
important considerations to achieve selectivity.

3.1. Catalytic oxidation of methane on metal catalysts

Although methane is the simplest hydrocarbon and its cata-
lytic oxidation kinetics has been studied widely, consensus on the
mechanistic pathways of this reaction is still lacking. Even on metal
catalyst surfaces, elementary steps of the reaction mechanism are
not fully resolved. Many of the catalytic reactions of methane are
further complicated by side reactions (3)–(6) and their products CO2
and H2O that participate in further reactions with methane.

Kinetic studies [85,86] of methane oxidation on Pt catalyst sup-
ported on Al2O3 was best described by the Langmuir–Hinshelwood
(L–H) mechanism, where the rate limiting step is usually the re-
action between the adsorbed atomic oxygen and adsorbed methane
according to the following simplified scheme.

but may involve several elementary steps. The results of a Monte
Carlo study of methane oxidation on oxidized Pd catalyst were con-
sistent with the L–H type mechanism, but it was proposed that the
reaction (9) of the adsorbed species occurs not on a single active
site, but on two sites [63]. Theoretical simulations combined with
experimental verification of the methane oxidation reaction mech-
anism on Pt and Rh assuming a L–H type desorption model [87]
provide a detailed list of possible elementary reaction steps with
associated rate constants and activated energies and indicate that
the pyrolytic pathway for methane oxidation has a higher activa-
tion energy than the oxygen-mediated pathway that involves an
oxygenated surface. Under high surface coverage of the catalyst
surface with oxygen at moderate temperatures and oxygen-rich re-
action environments, the oxygen-mediated pathway for methane
oxidation may dominate overall kinetics over the pyrolytic pathway.
A similar study of methane oxidation on Cu- and Ag-modified CeO2
support reported strong dependence of catalytic activity on the crys-
tallite size of ceria and found the reaction involves L–H type of
mechanism [88].

Using solid electrolyte potentiometry for monitoring oxygen ac-
tivity at the Ag catalyst/solid electrolyte interface during the reaction,
the kinetics of methane oxidation on Ag anodes was represented
by the Eley–Rideal mechanism [89], where the mobile adsorbed
atomic oxygen is the active surface species that reacts with methane
in the gas phase. Similar experiments on Ag anodes supported this
view and indicated that surface oxygen on the catalytic anode is more
effective than oxygen supplied from the gas phase for methane ox-
idation [90]. The strongly bound surface oxygen site (i.e., Lewis base)
is proposed to catalyze the dehydrogenation reaction for the oxi-
dative coupling of methane to C2 hydrocarbons [91].

On the other hand, a systematic study [92] that considered L–H,
Eley–Rideal (E–R) and Mars–van Krevelen (MVK) mechanisms re-
ported that the surface kinetics of methane oxidation over Pd/
Al2O3 catalysts agree well with the MVK model [93]. This is in
agreement with other reports that oxidation proceeds by direct in-
teraction of the adsorbed species with the lattice oxygen in
accordance with the MVK mechanism [63], although several in-
consistencies have recently been pointed out in applying the MVK
model rate expression to oxidation. It was suggested that the re-
action steps describing the MVK model are not elementary in nature,
and an alternative kinetic model such as L–H can provide similar
rate expressions that may fit the data better [94]. Indeed, the product
selectivity of methane oxidation seems to depend largely on the
availability of oxide ions on the catalyst surface. Using in situ mi-
croprobe Raman and time resolved FTIR spectroscopies, others [95]
observed that CH4 oxidation products over Rh/SiO2 and Ru/SiO2 cata-
lysts yield CO2 when the surface concentration of O2− is high, and
CO when it is low, although the reaction mechanisms on the two
catalysts were found to be different. Similar findings by an isoto-
pic study of methane partial oxidation to syngas reported that
CH4—O2 and CD4—O2 reactions on Rh/γ-Al2O3 catalysts yield CO2 as
the only reaction product at 450 °C, indicating complete oxidation
is predominant under these conditions [96]. More recent studies
on oxygen dosed Pt and Pd surfaces suggested that PdO surface is
catalytically more active for CH4 and CO oxidation than metallic Pt
and Pd surfaces saturated with chemisorbed oxygen under near stoi-
chiometric conditions, which severely suppresses methane activation,
whereas Pt and Pd surfaces under low-oxygen activity are found to
be quite active [97]. Oxygen isotope studies of methane oxidation
on metal oxide-supported Pd-based catalysts were found to be con-
sistent with the Pd/PdO redox combustion mechanism, where oxygen
adsorbed on the Pd/PdO migrates to the support and participates
in the catalytic oxidation of methane [61]. It was observed that the
oxygen exchange rate between the support and the catalyst is de-
pendent on temperature as well as on the nature of the support
material. For example, oxidation rates over ZrO2-supported PdO cat-
alyst showed marked increase above 450 °C, while MgO- and Al2O3-
supported PdO catalysts exhibited no improvement over pure PdO
catalysts within the same temperature regime [61]. This is consis-
tent with the higher oxide ion mobility in zirconia than in alumina,
and the kinetic results were in good agreement with the MVK type
redox reaction.

DFT calculations for Pd, PdO and CeO2-supported Pd catalysts pro-
vided insights into the mechanistic pathways and indicated that C—H
bond activation remains to be the rate-determining step for the
overall reaction with barrier heights ranging from 0.18 eV over
PdxCe1 − xO2(111), to 0.89 eV for Pd(111), to 1.08 eV for PdO(100) [98].
Over CeO2 and PdxCe1 − xO2, C—H bond activation proceeds via se-
quential abstraction of H from the adsorbed CH4 by the surface
(lattice) oxygen to form CHx (x = 1–3) adsorbates with the forma-
tion of intermediates including HCO, CO and eventually CO2, when
desorbed oxygen leaves behind an oxide ion vacancy. DFT studies
of methane oxidation on Pt also reported similar reaction path-
ways that involve surface oxygen [60,71].

3.1.1. Catalyst–support interactions

Interactions between the metal catalyst and the oxide support
material during methane catalysis are important as they can affect
both the reaction pathways and the product distribution [95,99,100].
Strong metal–support interactions have been widely recognized
[101]. For example, the sintering resistance of nanosize precious
metal catalysts supported on TiO2 [102], CeO2 [103,104], Al2O3 and
SiO2 [105] have been demonstrated and their enhanced catalytic ac-
tivity was explained by oxygen adatom transfer from the support
to the catalytic particle surface. It is also known that the catalyst

Evac, from 2.25 eV for the case of the extended CeO2(111) surface to 0.80 eV for the Ce40O80 nanocluster. This makes reverse spillover of oxygen from the Ce40O80 nanocluster
to the Pt8 aggregate energetically more favorable, leading to the formation of two Ce+3 active centers in the nanocluster. [Reprinted with permission from Ref. 109 Vayssilov

particle size at the nanoscale plays an important role not only on
catalytic activity, but also on selectivity [106,107].

In the case of ceria supported metal catalysts, it is suggested that
the improved sintering resistance of the catalyst particles may be
due to the oxygenated metal surface, which improves bonding of
the catalyst particle to the reduced ceria surface [108] and retards
volatilization of the catalyst [105]. Calorimetric measurements of
the heat of adsorption also indicated that Ag nanoparticles <4 nm
in diameter bind more strongly to reduced CeO2 − x(111) surface than
to a non-reducible surface such as MgO (100) [108]. Size effect of
the support material is also important. Combining resonance pho-
toemission spectroscopy (RPES) with theoretical predictions using
Vienna ab initio program (VASP), a recent study on the Pt8 clus-
ters supported on bulk CeO2(111) and Ce40O80 nanoclusters has
shown that the formation of oxygen vacancies is heavily favored by
nanostructuring, where energy of oxygen vacancies is reduced sig-
nificantly from 2.2.5 eV for the bulk CeO2(111) surface to 0.80 eV
for Ce40O80 [109]. This is shown in Fig. 4.

Catalyst particle size and electronic effects [110] play interac-
tive roles in oxide ion exchange and mobility, and dramatically affect
catalytic activity and selectivity. While the metal catalyst may trans-
fer electrons to the support material, the latter may in turn transfer
oxygen to the metal catalyst surface. The surface transfer of oxygen
and hydrogen between the catalyst and support, or with another
catalyst, is commonly observed in catalysis and is called spillover
[111]. Surface spectroscopy backed by theoretical calculations pro-
vided evidence for two types of interactions involving Pt
nanoparticles supported on CeO2, namely, electron transfer from Pt
to ceria, and oxygen transfer from ceria to Pt [109]. This study also

reported that spillover of oxygen to Pt is accompanied by increase
in the concentration of Ce+3 in ceria, and is a nanoscale effect, which
requires nanostructured Pt particles in intimate contact with ceria.
Size dependence on catalytic activity and selectivity has been well
recognized [106]. Such dependence is reported for water–gas shift
reaction (5) on 2–4 nm size Cu catalysts supported on CeO2(111)
and ZnO(0001) [112] as well as for dry reforming reaction (4) of
methane on Rh catalyst supported on various oxides, which showed
high catalytic activity for Rh up to 6 nm with decreasing activity
for larger sizes [113]. It also showed strong correlation of catalytic
activity with the acidic character of the support material
surface, where Rh activity for dry reformation decreased in the
order of the supporting materials: yttria-stabilized zirconia
(YSZ) > Al2O3 > TiO2 > SiO2 > La2O3 > MgO. This activity ranking cor-
relates qualitatively with oxide ion mobility in these oxides, which
is highest for YSZ and lowest for MgO.

Oxygen exchange between the metal and the support material
is extensively studied for ceria-supported Pd, which is known as one
of the most effective catalyst systems for methane oxidation. The
catalytically active phase for this reaction is PdO [114], which is stable
up to 650 °C but reduces to Pd at higher temperatures. Reducible
oxides such as CeO2 can stabilize the PdO phase. During the reac-
tion, PdO is reduced to metallic Pd by transfer of oxygen to the ceria
support, which in turn provides the oxygen back to Pd for methane
oxidation [61]. The latter process is usually called reverse- or
back-spillover.

In addition to ion exchange or spillover, metal–support interac-
tions also involve donation or back-donation of electrons between
the catalyst metal and the surface adsorbate. Such electronic effects

built by the spillover of ions supplied via the support, for the case of CO oxidation. [Reprinted with permission from Ref. 124: Vayenas CG, Catal. Lett. 2013; 143: 1085–

play an equally important role in catalysis, as electron transfer alters
the strength of the chemisorptive bond of the surface species. In
general, adsorbates that donate electrons to the metal catalyst lower
the catalyst work function, while those that accept electrons from
the metal catalyst increase its work function. Induced by a suit-
able current or potential applied externally, the migration (i.e.,
spillover) of the ionic species such as Oδ− from the solid oxide elec-
trolyte (i.e., support) to the metal catalyst surface is accompanied
by its compensating charge in the oxide. This leads to the forma-
tion of surface dipoles, which eventually form the electrochemical
double layer on the catalyst surface exposed to the reactant gases
composed generally of an oxidizing reactant or fuel such as a hy-
drocarbon, CO, NO, NH3, and an oxidant such as O2. As expected,
the double layer also contains adsorbed reaction intermediates.

The double layer formation over metal catalysts supported on
O2− and Na+ conducting oxides are illustrated in Fig. 5 (a) and (b),
respectively. The density of the double layer, which may be as small
as 5% of a monolayer [115], is dependent on the applied potential
or current that drives the ions on to the metal catalyst surface. This
in turn alters the work potential of the metal catalyst and conse-
quently the binding energy or strength of the reactants and
intermediates, hence, altering catalytic activity and selectivity for
many hydrocarbon oxidation and oxidative coupling reactions
[75,116–119]. Even though there is molecular O2 in the reaction gas
phase, spillover of oxide ions on to the catalyst metal surface driven
by a small amount of externally applied current or voltage gives rise
to a dramatic enhancement in the oxidation rate of the reactant fuel

above and beyond the Faradaic current through the cell. This effect
is coined NEMCA, for non-Faradaic electrochemical modification of
catalytic activity [120–124], where electronegative promoters such
as O2− increase the work function of the metal catalyst while elec-
tropositive promoters such as Na+ lower the work function. This
behavior is depicted in Fig. 6, which also indicates the work func-
tions for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd row transition metal catalysts [125].
The NEMCA effect has successfully been demonstrated for a long
list of catalytic reactions [125] involving many hydrocarbons, CO,
H2, and NH3, where reaction rates were reportedly enhanced by as
much as 104 beyond the Faradaic limit [116,126–128]. In situ mea-
surements of the change in the catalyst work function by Kelvin
probe upon electrochemical supply (or removal) of oxide ions made
it clear that the catalytic activity is intimately related to the elec-
tronic structure of the metal catalyst [115,116,129,130].

The observed spillover effect of Oδ− on catalytic rates is not re-
stricted to O2−-ion conducting support materials only, but was
observed also for many important hydrocarbon-involving reac-
tions studied on catalysts supported on H+- and Na+-ion conducting
ceramic supports such as Y-doped BaZrO3 (BYZ) and sodium β′′-
alumina, respectively, and even on proton conducting polymeric
supports such as Nafion [116,125,131]. It is suggested that the
spillover–backspillover of species taking part in the promotion effect
of NEMCA at the triple phase boundaries (tpb) between the metal
catalyst, the electrolyte, and the reacting gas phase serve merely
as promoters and not directly participate at the reaction as reac-
tants [124]. In other words, in NEMCA dominated catalysis the

It is generally assumed that gas phase oxygen upon adsorption
on the oxide catalyst surface can sequentially accept electrons until
fully reduced [144]. This can be described by the stepwise se-
quence depicted in Fig. 7, where the subscript “s” indicates a surface
site, and (O2−)latt denotes the lattice oxygen. Note that for the latter,
the presence and the availability of oxygen vacancies near the surface
is required for the adsorbed surface oxygen O2− to be incorporated
into the oxide lattice.

Adsorption of gaseous reactants on to nearly defect-free oxide
surfaces is generally weak due to the saturated bonds and the large
band gap. Indeed, group IIA alkaline earth metal oxides, such as MgO,
are insulators with usually wide band gaps (e.g., ~7.8 eV for MgO),
so their catalytic activities are quite limited. Electron paramag-
netic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) studies of alkane and alkene
oxidation on MgO indicated that the surface species O−, which forms
at low temperatures usually when N2O is employed as the gaseous
oxidant, likely plays a significant role in selective oxidation of these
hydrocarbons by facilitating the initial hydrogen abstraction step
in the reaction sequence [145,146]. When promoted by the addi-
tion of Group IA alkali metal oxides, the catalytic activity of alkaline
earth oxides improves greatly. The alkali metal promoters in-
crease the conductivity of MgO by nearly four orders of magnitude,
inducing p-type conduction. More importantly, promotion by alkali
metal oxides also stabilizes the surface O− sites. In fact, EPR studies
on Li- and Na-promoted MgO and CaO identified the presence of
(Li—O−) and (Na—O−) centers on these oxide surfaces, which are re-
sponsible for the catalytic production of surface methyl groups via
hydrogen abstraction from methane by the O− species [147,148].

However, the view that (Li—O−) and (Na—O−) centers are indeed
the catalytically active sites on doped alkaline earth oxides was re-
cently challenged [149,150]. Temperature programmed oxidation
and theoretical studies have shown that the same sites are respon-
sible for methane activation on both Li-doped MgO and undoped
MgO catalysts, and the nature of the active sites was identified to
be the Mg+2O2− sites located at the crystal steps and corners which
binds CH4 preferentially [149]. However, the nature of the oxygen-
centers on oxides that activate the adsorbed CH4 via hydrogen
abstraction is still unclear. A first principles study on the roles of
several surface oxygen centers on lanthanum oxide clusters re-
2− and
ported he predicted energy barriers for CH4 activation on O2
O− sites to be ~196 kJ/mol and 33–42 kJ/mol, respectively, and sug-
2− site is the active oxygen center for
gested that the peroxide O2
activation [151]. More recently, density functional theory (DFT)
studies on methane activation on La2O3 clusters indicated the ac-
tivation barrier for hydrogen abstraction to be significantly less,
between 84 and 105 kJ/mol, and inconclusively proposed that both
O2− and O− centers may participate in the activation reaction [152].

Similarly, DFT studies on YAlO3
promoted alumina can activate methane at room temperature, where

transfer of hydrogen from methane to the oxygen in the YAlO3
cluster is thermodynamically favorable and almost barrierless [153].
Doping of alkaline earth oxides by lower valence cations is ex-
pected to reduce the formation energy for oxygen vacancies [138],
and generally make them better oxidants than the undoped host.

observed reaction rates dramatically exceed the Faradaic rates, some-
times by several orders of magnitude, and cannot be accounted for
by the ionic current through the solid electrolyte.

Although such dramatic enhancements have been the case for
many catalytic oxidation reactions, a recent thermodynamic study
indicated that this is usually not the case for hydrogenation reac-
tions, which show a weak NEMCA effect that often approaches the
Faradaic efficiency limit [132].

In fact, Faradaic behavior dominates the kinetics of synthesis re-
actions that involve reduction or the removal of oxygen from
electrode surfaces in contact with the reacting gas phase through
the solid electrolyte. A recent study of steam electrolysis in an SOFC
arrangement indicates that the rate of H2 production is proportion-
al to the current through the cell [133]. Obviously, this process
requires an externally applied potential imposed on the cell to drive
the uphill transport. Uphill reactions that have been enhanced by
this approach include NO reduction [134], CO2 methanation [135,136]
and CO hydrogenation (i.e., Fischer–Tropsch synthesis) [135,137].
In these cases, however, the rate enhancements were Faradaic in
nature and all correlated well with the ionic flux through the elec-
trolyte, which in turn is directly related to the measured current
across the cell.

3.2. Catalytic oxidation of methane on oxides

There is extensive literature on methane oxidation on various
oxide catalysts, some of which have been reviewed previously
[138–142]. A selective oxide catalyst must perform multiple func-
tions including activation of the adsorbed methane, hydrogen
abstraction, oxygen insertion and regeneration of the catalytic site
for the next turnover. Hence, the nature of the catalytically active
surface site is important. Oxidation catalysis involves the introduc-
tion of gaseous molecular oxygen along with the hydrocarbon
reactant, such as methane, into the reactor. It is possible that the
surface oxygen can also participate in the reactions. Therefore, it
is important to understand the relative roles of adsorbed oxygen
from the gas phase vis a vis the lattice oxygen from the oxide cat-
alyst. It was proposed some time ago that the concentration of
nucleophyllic oxygen, i.e., lattice oxygen – as opposed to the
electrophyllic, or, adsorbed oxygen, from the gas phase – controls
the selectivity of the oxide catalyst for total oxidation [143]. This
view is in agreement with the MVK mechanism.

The situation, however, is different when oxides are doped with high
valence dopants. For non-reducible oxides including the alkaline
earth oxides, substitution of a higher valence dopant on the cation
site in the host lattice creates an extra electron localized at the dopant
site, which serves as a Lewis base site. For reducible oxides such
as CeO2, on the other hand, a higher valence dopant such as Nb+5
can donate its excess electron to Ce+4 (i.e., Lewis acid site), reduc-
ing it to Ce+3. Indeed, a recent study indicated doping with high
valance transition metals has shown the existence strongly bound
O2− species that form on Mo-doped CaO films [154], which en-
hanced the oxidative coupling of methane on Au—Fe-doped MgO
[155].

Generally, oxygen strong adsorption onto a transition metal oxide
surface is facilitated by the overlap between the d-states of the metal
atoms and the 2p orbitals of the surface oxygen. As oxide surfaces
typically have defects, the interaction of oxygen from the gas phase
with such surface defects is important for oxidation reaction. Such
defects can be topographic as well as chemical in nature. The latter
may be the result of unintentional (e.g., impurities) or intentional
(i.e., extrinsic) doping. In this regard, transition metal oxides,
perovskites, and reducible oxides offer wide opportunities as well
as possibilities for doping strategies to control and increase the con-
centration of active surface sites such as oxygen vacancies for
molecular activation [138]. However, elucidation of the active surface
sites and the details of the activation mechanism are obviously more
challenging and elusive on these oxides.

Using N2O as the oxidant, selective oxidation of methane to meth-
anol and formaldehyde on SiO2-supported MoO3 catalysts is activated
by the reactive O− ions coordinated to the MoIV at the surface [156].
The O− ions abstract the hydrogen from methane forming the methyl
radicals that proceed to form HCHO and finally CH3OH. Using Raman
spectroscopy, catalytic activity on different crystal planes of MoO3
has identified the terminal (Mo=O) sites located on the side (100)
planes to be catalytically more active for selective oxidation of
methane to formaldehyde, while the bridging oxygen (Mo—O—Mo)
sites on the basal planes were likely to lead to complete oxidation
[157], in general agreement with other studies [158].

Reducible oxides such as CeO2 are generally good oxidant sources
for catalytic reactions including partial oxidation of methane [159].
It is known that the fully oxidized surface of undoped CeO2 (~5.5 eV)
does not exhibit significant catalytic activity [160]. The situation is
completely different for the reduced CeO2 − x surface, where the
oxygen nonstoichiometry dramatically influences the catalytic ac-
tivity. When reduced at high temperatures or under reducing
environments, stoichiometric CeO2 has the ability to liberate oxygen
through the reduction of Ce+4 to Ce+3 for charge compensation. In
Kroger–Vink notation, this reaction is expressed as,

where the specific rates were higher by a factor of 105 on Pd/CeO2
than on Pd/SiO2 catalysts [163]. Methane oxidation on Cu/CeO2 cata-
lysts indicated an L–H type of kinetics where the rate determining
step involves adsorbed methane, but the oxygen partial pressure
dependence of the rate expression suggested that perhaps more than
2−, O−, O2−) and lattice
one type of surface oxygen species (i.e., O2
oxygen likely participate in the activation step [164]. Enhanced cata-
lytic activity for methane was also reported for transition metal
oxides and fluorites supported on CeO2 [165–170].

3.3. Role of lattice oxygen in methane catalysis

In most catalytic oxidation reactions, the oxidant, usually mo-
lecular oxygen, is provided to the catalytic surface from the gas phase.
However, there is general agreement that most oxidation and oxi-
dative dehydrogenation reactions taking place on oxide catalysts can
adequately be described by the MVK mechanism, where the reac-
tant fuel is actually oxidized not by adsorbed oxygen from the gas
phase, but by the lattice oxygen atoms from the surface of the oxide
catalyst [138]. As the reaction product desorbs, it leaves behind an
oxygen vacancy, which then traps the next oxygen from the gas
phase. This mechanistic model requires the exchange of gaseous O2
with lattice oxygen on the surface of the oxide catalyst. In the case
of supported metal catalysts, this exchange happens on surface of
the oxide support prior to oxygen spillover to the metal catalyst
surface.

Exchange of gaseous oxygen with lattice oxygen on oxide sur-
faces has been known for a long time [171–173], and generally
proceeds via two thermally activated mechanistic pathways. Using
isotopic labeling for identification purposes, one pathway in-
volves exchange between the molecular oxygen isotope 18O18O(g) and
a single surface atom 16O(s) of the oxide. The other pathway in-
volves two surface oxide atoms 16O—16O(s) participating in the
exchange reaction. The single and double exchange reactions are

These reactions most likely involve several intermediate steps
during the dynamic exchange process including dissociative ad-
sorption of molecular 18O2 or 18O16O on the oxide surface, and the
associative desorption of 16O16O or 18O16O from the oxide surface.

porated into the oxygen sublattice, thus re-oxidizing the oxide
surface. Furthermore, the adsorption energy of O2 on fully oxi-
dized CeO2 surface was reported to be endothermic, while it is
exothermic on the reduced surfaces of CeO2 − x [161]. Although ev-
idence of methane adsorption on fully oxidized CeO2 is scarce,
enhanced dehydrogenation activity for steam reforming of methane
was reported for precious metal catalysts supported on CeO2(111),

It is clear that ready availability of both electrons and oxygen

oxygen vacancy concentration on the YSZ surface by atomic scale

control of yttria-doping levels has demonstrated that optimizing the
vacancy concentration on surface engineered YSZ dramatically im-
proves SOFC performance [174]. In a related study, the activation
energy for oxygen exchange on gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC) and YSZ
at high temperatures (T > 700 °C) was reported to be 3.3 eV and
2.3 eV, respectively, while for T < 700 °C, the corresponding activa-
tion energies were 0.9 eV and 0.7 eV [175]. Similarly, using ultra thin
(10–130 nm) yttria-doped ceria (YDC) interlayers deposited by ALD
on top of YSZ electrolyte has also improved SOFC performance
[176–178]. These results suggest that at high temperatures the avail-
ability of electrons is equally important for the oxygen exchange
reaction, and may be rate limiting on these oxides. High catalytic
activity observed for ceria supported metal catalysts is likely related
to its relative ease of reducibility to provide the electrons as well
as mobile lattice oxygen required for the exchange reaction. So re-
ducible oxides and oxides that can sustain large deviations in their
oxygen stoichiometries can be employed as either the active cata-
lysts or the catalyst supporting material and may offer significant
advantages.

Usually, oxides with strong metal–oxygen bonds, or large heats
of formation, exhibit low catalytic activity, while those with weak
bonds favor “deep” or complete oxidation. Selective catalysts tend
to be in the intermediate range in terms of their metal–oxygen
binding energies. This is an important consideration, as methane
oxidation on most oxides proceeds via the MVK mechanism that
involves surface redox of the lattice oxygen sites. The reduction step
involves the oxidation of methane, while the oxidation step may
proceed either via gas phase oxygen exchange, or by bulk trans-
port of lattice oxygen. The latter can be supplied either through a
mixed conducting oxide or through an oxide-ion conducting
electrolyte.

Mixed ionically electronically conducting (MIEC) perovskites with
extrinsically controlled non-stoichiometries in the oxygen sublattice
offer attractive opportunities for enhanced catalysis of the methane
electro-oxidation reaction. Perovskites have the general chemical
formula ABO3 − δ, where the typically lower valance and larger size
A-cation is located in 12-fold coordinated interstitial sites among
the BO6 octahedra in the simple cubic crystal structure. As long as
the sum of A- and B-site cations add up to 6, and the radii of the
A, B, and O site ions satisfy the Goldschmidt criteria for structural
stability, perovskites offer a vast choice of compositions in the ma-
terials space provided by extrinsic doping of appropriate cations on
the A and B sites that dramatically alter their physical and chem-
ical properties. For example, A-site doping with a lower valence
cation gives rise to the formation of mobile oxygen vacancies for
charge compensation, whereas B-site doping generally alters the elec-
tronic structure and catalytic properties of perovskites. As expected,
oxygen storage capacity i.e., oxygen non-stoichiometry, δ, is im-
portant for the lattice exchange reaction and relates to the oxygen
vacancy concentration dictated by the oxidation states of the A- and
B-site cations. Generally, non-stoichiometry parameter δ in-
creases with increasing temperature and decreasing oxygen partial
pressure. It is important to note that the catalytic activity of
perovskites is primarily governed by the nature of the B-site cation
[66,179].
recent work on the perovskite-based
La0.75Sr0.25Cr1 − xMnxO3 − δ anodes demonstrated the critical role of lattice
oxygen plays in the rate and selectivity of methane oxidation, where
complete oxidation [180] is favored by a small value of δ, i.e., low
oxygen vacancy concentration and increasing concentration of the
reducible B-site cation Mn, while larger non-stoichiometry favors
partial oxidation of methane [181].

Indeed,

Much of the earlier work on perovskite-based catalysts has been
reviewed elsewhere [86,141,142,182]. The important role of the
storage capacity of lattice oxygen has been highlighted in these
studies [183]. Catalytic combustion rates of methane on various
doped perovskites of the general composition La1 − xAxMO3 (where,

A = Sr, Ba, Ca, Ce, and M = Co, Mn, Fe, Cu, Ni, Cr) indicated that the
perovskite composition La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 exhibited reactivity compa-
rable to an alumina-supported Pt benchmarking catalyst for the
oxidation reaction at T < 550 °C, but became significantly less active
above 600 °C [86]. At low temperatures, the pressure dependence
of the rate expression was consistent with the Eley–Rideal mech-
anism [86,142], where methane oxidation rate depended on the
partial pressures of both methane and molecular oxygen. This sug-
gests that at these low temperatures the weakly bound oxygen
adsorbed from the gas phase on to the catalytic perovskite surface
is more active in oxidizing methane. Raising the reaction temper-
ature above 600 °C diminishes the oxygen pressure dependence,
indicating that in this temperature regime methane reacts with the
lattice (i.e., intrafacial) oxygen from the bulk oxide. In fact, the rate
of methane oxidation increases dramatically when lattice oxygen
becomes available to activate the methane C—H bond [66].
Catalytic combustion of methane was studied on doped
lanthanum cuprate-based perovskites of the varying composi-
tions LaMn1 − xCu1 − xO3 and LaCo1 − xCuxO3 below 800 °C, and found
to be effective oxidation catalysts with a first order kinetics for
methane producing 100% CO2 in the product stream [184]. It was
also reported in this study that Cu seems to have an adverse effect
on catalytic activity in both perovskite compositions, and the Mn-
based catalysts have shown higher catalytic activity than the Co-
based compositions, in qualitative agreement with the easier
reducibility of Mn+4 at temperatures lower than that for Co+3. This
again highlights the role of the Mn+4/Mn+3 redox couple in promot-
ing the mobility of the lattice oxygen and, hence, the observed
catalytic activity.

The lattice oxygen in doped-perovskites is unlikely to be in a
uniform state but may exhibit a range of binding energies and de-
sorption kinetics. In fact, temperature programmed desorption (TPD)
coupled with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) identified two
distinct types of desorbed oxygen, one that is associated with the
oxygen vacancy formed upon A-site doping and the other is as-
cribed to the partial reduction of the B-site cation valence that
liberates an equivalent amount of lattice oxygen [142]. Similar results
were reported by others for methane oxidation on perovskite cata-
lysts of the general compositions La1 − xAxMO3 (where, A = Sr, Ce, Eu,
and M = Co, Fe, Ni) [66], La1 − xSrxMnO3 (x = 0–0.5) [185],
La1 − xSrxM1 − yM′yO3 (where, M = Mn, Cu, Ni, Co, and M′ = Ni, Fe, Co)
[186], and La1 − xCexMnO3 [187], where in each study the TPD spectra
augmented by mass spectrometry (MS) or x-ray photoelectron spec-
troscopy (XPS) indicated at least two energetically different oxygen
peaks between 200 and 800 °C. The low temperature peak was as-
signed to suprafacial oxygen adsorbed from the gas phase, while
the peak at T > 500 °C was associated with intrafacial, or lattice,
oxygen. The results indicate that activation of molecular oxygen is
relatively easy to achieve at low temperatures, whereas the acti-
vation of the C—H bond is more difficult and requires high
temperatures. Moreover, increasing the dopant concentration x in
La1 − xSrxMnO3 shifted the gas phase 18O2 concentration to lower tem-
peratures in the TPD spectra, which is in line with increased oxygen
vacancy concentration in the perovskite thus facilitating easier ex-
change of oxygen. Isotopic experiments indicated that the gas phase
18O2 does not react directly with CH4, and oxygen exchange with 16Os
in the perovskite lattice precedes the C—H activation step [65]. The
reaction rate was first order (>0.9) with respect to methane
[86,141,184,186] and of the order of 0–0.5 with respect to oxygen
partial pressure, suggesting kinetic reversibility of oxygen
[86,141,142].

It should be noted, however, that the kinetic interpretations im-
plicitly or explicitly suggested by some of these studies, particularly
those that involved A-site substitution, were challenged. It was
argued that an MVK-type surface redox model assumes the supply
of oxygen from the gas phase, and occurs only when a reduced

13

surface site becomes available (i.e., irreversible), which obviously
renders the oxidation reaction to be the rate limiting step in the
exchange [188]. As expected, Sr substitution on the A-site greatly
impacts the concentration as well as the mobility of oxygen vacan-
cies. This provides better kinetics for re-oxidation of the reduced
lattice site, and up to an Sr-content of x ~ 0.2 enhances the cata-
lytic activity for methane oxidation [185].

In addition to the attention on lattice oxygen, doped-perovskites
containing transition metals show unusual behavior during chem-
ical and electrochemical catalysis, where the redox activity and
stability are generally assigned to the valence change of the tran-
sition metal cations [189–191]. Although all evidence above shows
that lattice oxygen is a redox partner for the molecular oxygen on
doped-perovskites, the transition metal–oxygen bonds also play a
key role in this exchange. In fact, X-ray absorption studies of the
redox-active surface centers on thin films of La1 − xAxM1 − xM′xO3
(where, A = Ba, Sr, Ca, and M and M′ = Fe, Co) [192] and MNiO3 (where
M = La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd) [193] compositions have recently pro-
vided direct evidence of strong transition metal 3d-oxygen 2p
hybridization effects, indicating the highly covalent and direction-
al character of the bonding. The degree of hybridization increases
with the d-electron count and the oxidation state of the B-site tran-
sition metal ions, which plays an important role in the catalytic
activity of the perovskite. Understanding the underpinnings of such
electronic interactions in these materials will help develop effec-
tive catalysts by designing rational doping strategies.

Although sulfur-poisoning of catalytic anodes is discussed in detail
in a later section (see Section 5.2), the importance of this topic and
its potential relation to lattice oxygen in mitigating the deactiva-
tion process justifies a brief account. In contrast to metal-based
catalytic anodes, oxides with sufficient tolerance to non-
stoichiometry in their oxygen sublattice may play an important role
for rendering sulfur resistance to the catalytic anodes during methane
oxidation in SOFCs when natural gas is employed directly without
prior desulfurization. However, the mechanistic understanding of
sulfur interactions with lattice oxygen is not well established. A series
of surface analytical studies to understand sulfur interaction with
lattice oxygen on various chromite-based perovksites including
La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3 (LSCM) [194], La0.75Sr0.25Cr1 − xMnxO3 (x = 0.2,
0.5, 0.8) [195], and Sm0.9Sr0.1CrxFe1 − xO3 (x = 0.2, 0.5, 0.8) [196] re-
vealed several interesting results. Upon treatment of these oxides
in H2S (balance N2) environments ranging from 1000 ppm up to 20%
at 800 °C for several hours in the absence of oxygen in the gas phase,
x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) results indicated the pres-
2−) group on the surface, suggesting strong
ence of sulfate (SO4
interaction of sulfur with lattice oxygen not only on the surface but
also participation from the bulk. The depleted oxygen is supplied
from the bulk by diffusion toward the surface. It was also sug-
gested that the adsorbed sulfur is trapped in the oxygen vacancies
and binds to adjacent oxygens. XPS results also showed no shift in
the binding energies of Cr indicating no valance change upon ex-
posure to reducing H2S environment, whereas multi-valent Mn ions
are detected on the B-sites. It was proposed that the Mn4+—O—Mn3+
clusters might be responsible for the observed sulfur tolerance in
LSCM [195]. The results also suggest that the electronic conduc-
tivity and catalytic activity of these doped chromite-based
perovskites are governed primarily by Mn and not by Cr, in agree-
ment with others [197]. Catalytic studies of methane oxidation at
700–900 °C over La0.75Sr0.25CrxMn1 − xO3 − δ (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1) with
varying oxygen stoichiometries in a pulse reactor in the absence of
gas phase O2 revealed that high oxygen stoichiometry (i.e., small
δ) as well as the availability of reducible B-site cations are neces-
sary to make an effective catalyst for full oxidation of methane
[180,181]. The selectivity varied with oxygen stoichiometry from
the upper limit of 100% full oxidation at high stoichiometry to 100%
toward partial oxidation at low stoichiometry, pointing to the strong

role of lattice oxygen as an active participant in the oxidation re-
action. Certainly, higher stoichiometry provides a higher
concentration of lattice oxygen on the surface available to partic-
ipate in the oxidation reaction, whereas low stoichiometries (i.e.,
large δ) restrict this supply. It was also observed that the reaction
rate and the oxygen stoichiometry regime that provide high selec-
tivity for full oxidation of methane increased with increasing Mn
content in LSCM, which also agrees with the earlier views of the
catalytic role Mn plays in these structures.

Although not within the scope of this article, it is interesting to
point out that the role of lattice oxygen is also being explored as a
source for oxygen for the oxidation reaction in the context of chem-
ical looping for combustion and partial oxidation of methane, and
even coal. Many different oxygen carriers either as partially reduc-
ible oxides such as CeO2—Co3O4
[167], and CeO2—Fe2O3
[50,169,170,198], or transition metal oxides [48,67,199,200] have been
investigated for methane combustion. In this process scheme, com-
bustion is totally separated from the carrier re-oxidation step and
hence, no nitrogen enters the combustion stream in the first place.
Thus, chemical looping eliminates the need for post-separation op-
erations to capture CO2.

4. Electrochemical conversion of methane in SOFCs

Electrochemical conversion provides unique opportunities above
and beyond catalytic conversion discussed in previous sections. This
is illustrated in Fig. 8, which qualitatively represents the energet-
ics of the transition state profile along the reaction coordinate for
reactants and products during chemical change. The free energy
change, ΔGrxn, during the chemical reaction is given by the differ-
ence in the forward and reverse reaction minima. The presence of
an effective catalyst helps reduce the activation barrier, E*act, for the
reactants to overcome, thus accelerating the reaction rate. However,
the presence of the electrical potential, η, can dramatically alter the

energy profile of the chemical reaction, by lowering the activation
barrier for the forward reaction by αzFη, where α is the symme-
try factor for the transition state, F is the Faraday constant, and z
is the charge of the electroactive species. It may also increase the
barrier for the reverse reaction by the amount (1 − α)zFη. Such ef-
fective control makes electrochemical conversion significantly more
advantageous over chemical catalysis.

Fuel cells are essentially electrochemical engines that convert
the chemical energy of fuels directly into electrical energy. Fig. 9
illustrates several major types of fuel cells, indicating the net half-
cell electrode reactions as well as the primary ionic species that
transport charge through the electrolyte while electrons travel
through the external circuit performing useful electrical work. The
basic process involves oxidation of the fuel at the anode and shut-
tling the electrons released during electro-oxidation reaction through
the external circuit to the cathode, where they are consumed in re-
ducing the molecular oxygen (in air) to ionic form. In all cases,
methane or natural gas is likely the starting fuel stock, but methane-
derived hydrogen is the desired and most extensively employed fuel
for most fuel cells, despite the fact that H2 is not a primary energy
source but an energy carrier, which must be produced in the first
place. This preference is primarily because hydrogen can readily be
oxidized, while methane activation is sluggish and challenging.
Hence, both high temperatures and highly active catalytic elec-
trodes are required to activate methane. But even molten carbonate
fuel cells (MCFC) employing typically a eutectic mixture of alkali
metal carbonates as the molten electrolyte at 650–750 °C or alka-
line fuel cells (AFC) with a molten hydroxide electrolyte such as NaOH
operating at ~ 600 °C can utilize methane only after external re-
forming. Also, because of the low solubility of methane in liquid
electrolytes, low temperature fuel cells are unsuitable for direct use
of methane as the fuel at the anode.

Moreover, the hot corrosive electrolytes of MCFC and AFC pose
major challenges for the stability of cell materials and compo-
nents including the dissolution of the NiO cathode in the molten

carbonate electrolyte and precipitating it in the form of Ni else-
where eventually causing electrical shorting of the MCFC. It is also
difficult to achieve internal steam reforming in the MCFC due to lack
of effective and stable reforming catalysts that can withstand poi-
soning by the alkali metal attack from the molten carbonate
electrolyte [201–203]. Typical reforming catalysts such as Ni show
rapid decrease in intrinsic catalytic activity by Li+ and Na+ poison-
ing, and even more severe by K+. Furthermore, MCFCs require tight
management of CO2 formed at the anode, 2/3 of which needs to be
recycled to the cathode in order to sustain the carbonate forma-
tion reaction as indicated by the cathode reaction for MCFC (see
Fig. 9). Similarly, the molten hydroxide AFC suffers from the para-
sitic reaction between the anode product CO2 and the molten
hydroxide that precipitates the solid carbonate that eventually clogs
up the cell and degrades cell performance.

So SOFCs are considered more suitable to employ methane di-
rectly as the fuel, with or without reformation. They promise clean,
efficient and environmentally friendly conversion [204], and also
offer an unusually wide range of fuel flexibility including not only
gaseous fuels but also liquid fuels [29], and even solid fuels includ-
ing carbon [34], untreated coal [36] and biomass [35].

Electrochemical conversion in SOFC provides effective control
and tuning of the oxygen activity on catalytic electrode surfaces
in order to enhance catalytic activity [205]. In fact, electrochemi-
cal monitoring of the activity of electroactive surface species during
heterogeneous catalysis by the use of solid electrolytes is not a
new concept, but proposed several decades ago [206]. The princi-
ple concept was implemented successfully in solid-electrolyte-
potentiometry (SEP) measurements for ethylene oxidation [207,208]
as well as methane oxidation on catalytic anodes including Pt [209],
Ag [89] and Pd [210] deposited on YSZ electrolyte. The SEP
technique was also used successfully for other reactions such as
the oxidation of hydrogen on nickel anode [211] and for SO2
oxidation on Pt, Ag, and Au anodes [212] on solid oxide
electrolytes.

It is important to note that SOFC configurations not only provide
passive monitoring of catalytic activity as in SEP, but also allow active
control and tuning of the oxygen activity at the metal/electrolyte
interface as well as the transport of oxide ions from the metal cat-
alyst surface in order to “cleanse” and avail the catalytic metal surface
for the next turnover. Such control of oxygen activity has been dem-
onstrated to dramatically affect catalytic rates. Reaction turnover
frequencies, up to several orders of magnitude for many industri-
ally important reactions including NO reduction [134], CO2
methanation [135,136], and CO hydrogenation (i.e., Fischer–
Tropsch synthesis) [135,137], have been reported previously.

Attempts to electrochemically covert methane and other hydro-
carbons on precious metal anodes in SOFCs have been reported
previously for cells employing solid ion conducting solid electro-
lytes such as YSZ [213–219], as well as for proton conducting solid
electrolytes such as Y2O3-doped BaCeO3 (BYC) [44,46,220]. Much of
this early work on electrochemical reactor systems to oxidize and
transform methane on various catalytic electrodes in SOFC arrange-
ments has been reviewed extensively [42,43,131,221].

4.1. SOFC operating principle and materials

SOFCs are quiet, environmentally friendly engines that achieve
efficient energy conversion isothermally, and with significantly
reduced CO2 emissions that is almost capture-ready. There are pri-
marily three major SOFC architectures, namely, cathode-supported,
anode-supported and electrolyte-supported. A single complete unit
of the cathode–electrolyte–anode structure is usually called the
membrane electrode assembly, or MEA for short. Stacking of MEAs
makes up the SOFC stack or module. The different MEA architec-
tures, as well as materials properties, requirements and challenges
for the SOFC science and technology have been discussed and re-
viewed in great detail elsewhere [204,222–230]. In each, the thick
support material serves as the mechanical and structural scaffold
upon which the other functional cell components are built. In the
electrode-supported MEA geometries, the porous cathode or anode
thickness is nominally 1 mm, where the electrolyte membrane is
nominally 10 μm in thickness. Conversely, in electrolyte-supported
MEA architecture, the dense impervious electrolyte membrane whose
thickness can be somewhere in the range of 200–500 μm pro-
vides the mechanical stability for the cell structure. Thin film anode
and cathode layers are subsequently deposited on both faces of the
electrolyte membrane. Yet a different MEA architecture employs ultra
thin (100–1000 nm) electrolyte membranes built on silicon-based
substrates using micromechanical machining and lithography tech-
niques. The latter approach for fabricating ultra thin membrane
SOFCs has been reviewed recently [231,232]. As there have been

many excellent reviews on various aspects of SOFC materials and
performance, only the basic principles and materials that are per-
tinent to methane oxidation are presented below.

4.1.1. SOFC basics

Typically SOFCs consist of an oxide ion conducting dense ceramic
electrolyte membrane sandwiched in between two catalytic elec-
trodes that serve as the anode and the cathode, as shown
schematically in Fig. 10 for the simplest case of a cell operating on
H2 fuel.

In principle, the operation of SOFCs involve the reduction of mo-
lecular oxygen at the cathode into ionic form and transport of O2−
ions through a solid oxide electrolyte membrane to the anode where
the fuel reacts with the O2− ions to oxidation products. The elec-
trons released during this charge transfer reaction travel through
the external circuit from the anode to the cathode, performing useful
electrical work along the way. Finite rates of the electrode pro-
cesses (i.e., activation losses) as well as the finite electrical resistance
of the cell components (i.e., ohmic losses) naturally decrease the
available cell voltage, which in turn reduces cell efficiency and per-
formance. At very high polarization (i.e., high current densities),
transport limitations of the reacting and product species give rise
to mass transport losses. In the case of macroscopic or even mi-
croscopic cracks in the cell structure, gas leakage across the cell can
cause chemical shorting (i.e., cross over) of the fuel and/or the
oxidant, and lower the useful cell voltages (i.e., measured) from the
theoretically expected value of the open circuit voltage (OCV). In a
similar manner, if there is electronic contribution to the total current
through the electrolyte membrane, this may also lower the mea-
sured OCV due to electronic semipermeability.

Assuming no chemical shorting or semipermeability, and that
equilibrium exists between the gas phase species and the cata-
lytic electrode surfaces, the useful cell voltage under zero-current
conditions will otherwise be the same as the theoretically ex-
pected OCV. Fig. 10 qualitatively indicates the regimes of dominant
loss mechanisms in SOFCs.

Previously, precious metal electrodes – mostly Pt [233–239] –
were employed routinely in SOFCs for their high catalytic activity
both for the fuel oxidation as well as the highly activated and slug-
gish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), namely,

As reaction (18) involves species from three different phases,
namely, molecular oxygen from the gas phase, oxygen vacancies from
the electrolyte, and electrons residing in the metal electrode, it can
occur only at the triple phase boundaries (tpb) bounded by the

respective phases. In other words, the tpb defines the electrochem-
ically active zone. It was reported that the estimated tpb width at
the metal electrode/solid electrolyte interface is quite narrow, of the
order of 1 μm [240,241]. The results of Secondary Ion Mass Spec-
trometry (SIMS) coupled with oxygen isotope exchange experiments
on cathodically biased Pt/YSZ interfaces indicated that electrolyte
grain boundaries are also active sites for oxygen exchange on YSZ
[242], as well as doped YDC [243]. Since the cell current is prefer-
entially restricted to these practically one-dimensional boundaries,
decreasing the grain size improves cell performance in
the Pt/nanocrystalline YSZ system with YSZ particle sizes <20 nm
[244].

As the polarization resistance is inversely proportional to the tpb
length, extending the tpb from a one-dimensional narrow zone to
2- or 3-dimensional space naturally maximizes its density and greatly
improves cell performance. In this regard, subsequent develop-
ments in metal/ceramic cermets and mixed ionically electronically
conducting (MIEC) oxides as effective catalytic electrode materials
have presented attractive opportunities to expand the tpb into 2-
and 3-dimensions, respectively. As expected, mixed conduction of
both oxide ions and electronic species broaden the electrochemi-
cally active region away from the current collector by small polaron
hopping and thus enhance cell performance [245,246]. When slightly
reduced under the reducing environment at the SOFC anode, ceria
is a mixed conductor and a popular cermet anode component. In
situ photoelectron x-ray spectroscopy of CeO2 − x during SOFC op-
eration has shown that the electrochemically active region can
expand out to nearly 150 μm away from the Au current collector
and this active region is defined by the presence of the Ce+4/Ce+3
redox couple [247]. Contingent on independent verification, this ex-
citing finding of such a remarkably wide tpb zone is important for
designing optimized electrode microstructures for practical appli-
cations As MIEC materials and their composites allow the tpb zone
to extend in three dimensions, there has been much attention and
activity in exploring and developing doped-perovskites for cathode
materials in the recent decades [245,248–256], and much of this
work has been reviewed elsewhere [257–261]. By comparison, the
width of the tpb zone for the MIEC La1 − xSrxMnO3 cathode is esti-
mated to be only 0.03–0.07 μm [262]. However, it must be noted
that it is extremely difficult to make accurate experimental deter-
mination of the tpb width and length, which are parameters very
difficult to define and measure. So these widths are often inferred
from isotopic oxygen exchange measurements and polarization be-
havior of model or patterned electrodes [240,246,262–266].

Naturally, the tpb concept is also important for an effective anode,
and requires maximization of the electrochemically active area.
Cermets, which are mixtures of catalytic metal particles dispersed

inside an ionically conducting porous solid oxide matrix, aim to maxi-
mize the density of tpb in the anode structure.

State-of-the-art SOFC designs usually employ anode-supported
planar cell architecture, which consists of a cermet anode, typical-
ly made of an ~1 mm thick porous sintered mixture of Ni and YSZ
fabricated by tape casting that provides mechanical stability for the
cell structure. A thin film of dense YSZ layer of 10 μm in nominal
thickness is deposited on the support structure. Finally, 50–
100 μm thick porous film of mixed ionically electronically conducting
(MIEC) doped-perovskite – typically La1 − xSrxMnO3 (LSM),
La1 − xSrxCo1-yFeyO3 (LSCF) or mixtures with YSZ – deposited on top
of the YSZ membrane serves as the cathode. A typical example of
this architecture is illustrated in Fig. 11, courtesy of Materials and
Systems Research, Inc. of Salt Lake City, Utah [267]. For electrode
supported MEAs, the porous composite of one or more oxides is co-
sintered at high temperatures to make mechanically robust a porous
structure. In the case of anode-supported cells, the sintered mixture
is typically made of NiO and YSZ particles. Regardless of whether
the cell structure is anode- or cathode-supported, the porous cermet
anode must be reduced prior to obtaining a fully operational MEA.
This is accomplished by the chemical reduction of NiO in the porous
cermet anode to metallic Ni in H2 atmosphere at high temperatures.
It should be pointed out that despite intense efforts in materi-
als research and development, there have only been gradual but no
groundbreaking advancements in SOFC performance in the last
fifteen years, when a series of studies reported record high power
densities of 1.7–1.9 W/cm2 using H2 fuel at 800 °C for Ni/YSZ cermet
anode-supported SOFCs with YSZ thin film electrolyte of about 10 μm
in thickness and LSM cathodes [268–272]. Since then, there has been
one notable exception that exceeded these record performance
values. An anode-supported SOFC architecture that employed hu-
midified H2 fuel and a bilayer electrolyte made of 10 μm thick
gadolinia-stabilized ceria (Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95) and 4 μm thick erbia-
stabilized bismuth oxide (Er0.4Bi1.6O3), and a bismuth ruthenate–
bismuth oxide composite cathode has achieved an exceptionally high
power density of 2 W/cm2 at the low operating temperature of
650 °C, setting a new record [273]. There have also been predic-
tive attempts to guide SOFC research to minimize polarization losses
and pave the pathway toward achieving high cell performance
[274,275]. The models predict that even with thin film electro-
lytes (nominally ~10 μm thick YSZ), ohmic losses, which partly arise
from the finite electrical resistivity of the electrolyte membrane, may
still dominate performance. Overcoming this hurdle may require
advanced solid electrolytes with superior ionic conductivity as well
as catalytic electrodes that exhibit excellent electronic conductiv-
ity. As expected, these arguments emphasize the need for new
materials discovery, which will benefit from predictive theoretical

tools to guide materials selection, and advanced synthesis and pro-
cessing tools to design and structure materials for targeted properties.
In other words, materials properties and behavior is key to achiev-
ing high SOFC performance, especially for methane conversion.

4.1.2. Solid oxide electrolytes for SOFCs

The most common electrolyte material used in SOFCs is 8 mol%
Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 (YSZ) of the cubic fluorite crystal structure,
which transports O2− ions selectively through vacancies in the oxygen
sublattice that are generated upon the extrinsic substitution of an
aliovalent dopant (in this case, Y+3 ions) on Zr+4 sites in the cation
sublattice. For every two Y+3 ions substituted on Zr+4 sites, an oxygen
••) forms in order to maintain charge neutrality of the
vacancy (VO
solid. Oxide ion vacancies provide a transport pathway for lattice
oxygen to diffuse through the crystal lattice and carry its ionic charge.
The formation of oxygen vacancies upon doping, and the vacancy
exchange mechanism for ion transport is illustrated in Fig. 12. Al-
though, Sc2O3-stabilized zirconia provides by far the highest ionic
conductivity among the other rare earth dopants [276], the highly
activated nature (~1 eV) of the oxide ion transport through the crystal
lattice in all doped zirconias necessitates high operating tempera-
tures to attain sufficient ionic conductivity for meaningful fluxes.
Nevertheless, their excellent chemical stability over a very wide range
of oxygen chemical potentials commensurates with the highly oxi-
dizing and highly reducing conditions at the cathode and anode,
respectively, as well as their negligibly small electronic conductiv-
ity due to their wide (>5 eV) band gap makes this material the
preferred electrolyte for most SOFC applications.

Other important members in the family of fluorite-based oxide
ion electrolytes are doped CeO2 and the intrinsic oxide ion conduc-
tor δ-Bi2O3, both of which in fact have higher conductivities than
YSZ especially at temperatures lower than 800 °C. Indeed, δ-Bi2O3
exhibits the highest ionic conductivity of >1 S/cm at 800 °C, but is
only stable in a narrow temperature regime between 730 °C and its
melting temperature of 804 °C. This stability regime can be ex-
tended to lower temperatures by extrinsic doping of the Bi-
sublattice typically by Y2O3 or Er2O3, although usually at the expense
of lower conductivity. Electrolytes based on these doped oxides have
been considered for low temperature SOFC applications [273,277]
but their major shortcoming is their chemical instability in the re-
ducing environment at the anode side of the SOFC. This usually leads
to onset of p-type electronic conduction in the case of doped-
ceria due to the reduction of Ce+4 to Ce+3 thus reducing the useful

cell voltage, and, in the case of doped-Bi2O3, possible shorting or
failure of the cell by the reduction of Bi2O3 to metallic Bi or by vola-
tilization [259,278,279]. However, in many cases, this shortcoming
can be circumvented by the use of bi-layer electrolyte architec-
ture. Indeed, thin film YSZ interlayers deposited on the anode faces
of the doped-CeO2 or -Bi2O3 electrolytes physically isolate the elec-
trolyte from the reducing gas environment and helps prevent
electrolyte stability problems associated with the effect of reduc-
tion reactions [273,280,281].

Conversely, doped ceria has been successfully employed to serve
as the chemical barrier layer to prevent interdiffusion, interfacial
reactions, and secondary phase formation between SOFC compo-
nents both at the cathode and at the anode interfaces [259,278,282].
Doped-perovskites such as La1 − xSrxGa1 − yMg1 − yO3 (LSGM) based on
the LaGaO3 parent formula [283–285] have also been proposed and
employed as electrolytes for low temperature SOFCs [277]. Fig. 13
provides a comparison of the ionic conductivities of three differ-
ent solid oxide electrolytes belonging to the fluorite (YSZ and CGO)
and perovskite (LSGM) families. Wide range of materials proper-
ties of different cell components employed in SOFCs including

catalysts for anodes and cathodes, as well as different classes of elec-
trolyte membranes have been extensively reviewed elsewhere
[259,286,287,288].

4.1.3. Typical materials for catalytic electrodes

It is possible to reduce ohmic cell losses by employing thinner
electrolyte membranes without resorting to new materials. On the
other hand, activation losses at the electrodes are governed by ma-
terials properties and microstructure as well as the nature of the
electrode reactions and processes, and hence demand superior ma-
terials with inherently high catalytic activity and transport properties.
In other words, electrodes are arguably the most critical and de-
manding components of SOFCs that dominate cell performance. Their
primary function is to catalyze the fuel oxidation reaction at the
anode and the oxygen reduction reaction at the cathode in the most
efficient manner and at high turnover frequencies. Besides cata-
lytic activity, they must possess high electronic conductivity to
efficiently transport the electrons to and from the external circuit.
They must exhibit chemical, structural and thermal stability in the
highly reducing environment of the fuel at the anode, and the highly
oxidizing environment, typically, of air at the cathode, while op-
erating at elevated temperatures. Typically, the electrode morphology
is porous to expose high surface area to the reacting species, and
has a complex microstructure that consists of percolating catalyti-
cally active metal or a mixed conducting oxide, supported on an oxide
ion conducting solid electrolyte (see Fig. 11). The interfaces between
the electrolyte and composite electrode components must be stable
and nonreactive, as they play important roles in the charge trans-
fer reaction that typically takes place at the triple phase boundaries
(tpb). Functional cell components must have closely matching
thermal expansion coefficients to avoid thermal mismatch that can
lead to mechanical failure during thermal cycling of the SOFC. Con-
sequently, discovery and development of superior electrode materials
that meet these demanding requirements pose challenges.

Understandably, precious metals are too expensive to be con-
sidered as catalytic electrode materials for practical purposes,
although a recent report has demonstrated that functional Pt/YSZ
cermet electrode structures can be fabricated by atomic layer de-
position (ALD) at low Pt loadings <0.1 mg/cm2 [177]. Because of its
low cost and high catalytic activity, nickel is the most widely em-
ployed active catalyst in SOFC anodes in conjunction with YSZ or
ceria to make up the composite cermet structure. Similarly, mixed
conducting doped-perovskites have typically been employed as the
active cathode material in SOFCs.

A major challenge to efficient SOFC operation is to reduce the
large activation loss associated with the sluggish oxygen reduc-
tion reaction (18) at the cathode. This reaction has an activation
barrier as high as 1.5 eV [258,289] and constitutes a major frac-
tion of the cell losses in H2-fueled SOFCs. There has been enormous
volume of work to understand, design and develop advanced cata-
lytic cathode materials aimed at reducing or minimizing this large
activation loss. Unfortunately, the development of high perfor-
mance catalytic cathodes for SOFCs has been slow, partly because
it demands the right combination of materials properties includ-
ing high catalytic activity, high electronic and ionic conductivity,
mechanical robustness, chemical, structural and thermal stability
both in the oxidizing gaseous environment at the cathode com-
partment as well as against interdiffusion or solid state reaction with
the electrolyte that can lead to the formation of secondary phases
or blocking layers. Only few materials may be able to meet these
stringent requirements. Much effort and focus have been on MIEC
doped-perovskites. In particular, LSM and LSCF compositions have
been among the most studied, and currently been employed in state-
of-the-art SOFC cathode designs. Fundamental studies on perovskite-
based MIEC cathode materials and their transport and kinetic
properties have been reported elsewhere [257–261,289–298], and

will not be reviewed here. Among the challenges, however, Sr-
segregation to the surface has been a persistent problem that results
in the degradation of cell performance [299–301]. In addition, effects
including interdiffusion and reactions of the cathode material with
the electrolyte (e.g., blocking CoZrO3 phase formation at the LSCF/
YSZ interface) also contribute to the cell degradation mechanism
[282,302–304].

Anode is a critical component of SOFCs that allows versatility
and flexibility for different fuels to be employed for oxidation. Among
many of the materials requirements, anode must possess high cata-
lytic activity for oxidizing the fuel, provide sufficient electronic
conductivity to collect the electrons released during the oxidation
reaction, and have chemical, thermal and mechanical stabilities to
endure the highly reducing anode environment. Since its discov-
ery and introduction more than four decades ago, Ni/YSZ cermet
has been the most commonly employed SOFC anode material [305].
Certainly, a wide range of other anode materials has been under in-
vestigation toward practical applications. Recent advances in anode
materials development are extensively reviewed [306–309]. The chal-
lenges that still remain today for effective and direct utilization of
hydrocarbon fuels in SOFCs were discussed elsewhere [26,309–314].
Because of its high catalytic activity and low cost, Ni is rou-
tinely used as the active anode material for most SOFC studies and
applications. It is usually employed as a sintered composite mixture
of fine grain NiO powder in an ionically conducting oxide matrix
such as YSZ to make a porous cermet microstructure, which extends
the tpb into three dimensions when NiO is subsequently reduced
to metallic Ni that also serves as a 3-dimensional current collector
for the electrons. However, impurities such as SiO2, Na2O, etc. present
in Ni and/or YSZ may alter the nature of the interface between them
by segregation or secondary phase formation, thus blocking the tpb
sites and increasing interfacial resistance that lead to polarization
losses [303,315,316]. A recent review extensively discusses all aspects
of Ni-cermet anodes for methane conversion in SOFCs [317].

Much of the focus for the remaining of this paper will on anode
materials for SOFC, with particular emphasis on methane oxida-
tion. It should be pointed out, however, that much of the work to
date have involved the investigation and development catalytic anode
materials targeting the oxidation reaction of H2, which has over-
whelmingly been the preferred SOFC fuel of choice. In this regard,
various cermet compositions including Ni/YSZ and Ni/ceria
[316,318–320], as well as single phase or composite mixtures of
perovskite-type MIEC oxides [197,321–324], have been developed
and employed as anode materials in SOFCs.

For example, SrTiO3-based doped perovskites attracted atten-
tion as potential catalytic anodes for SOFCs due to their structural
stability over a wide oxygen partial pressure range and reason-
ably high electronic conductivity under reducing atmospheres.
Investigation of the physical and electrocatalytic properties of
LaxSr1 − xTiO3 (x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4) indicated that sintering in
H2, as opposed to in air, greatly improved electrical conductivity,
where H2-sintered La0.3Sr0.7TiO3 (LST) showed a conductivity value
of ~500 S/cm at 500 °C in PO2 <10–20 atm, while the conductivity
of the same composition sintered in air was almost 2 orders of mag-
nitude lower at the same reducing atmosphere even at 1000 °C.
Moreover, LST was stable over a wide oxygen pressure regime down
to 10−30 atm, dimensionally and chemically stable to multiple redox
cycling, and had an average thermal expansion coefficient of 11–
12 × 10−6 C−1 (between 500 and 1000 °C) that is compatible with YSZ
[323].

The electrical conductivity and structural stability of the parent
strontium titanate perovskite structure were investigated using rare
earth dopants (Y, La, Pr, Sm, Nd, Gd, YB) where the highest value
of the n-type electrical conductivity was 64 S/cm for Sr0.88Y0.08TiO3
at 800 °C and improved to 82 S/cm by slightly increasing the Sr-
vacancy concentration to Sr0.86Y0.08TiO3, which was also found to be

structurally stable over a wide oxygen partial pressure regime from
1 atm down to 10−20 atm at 1400 °C [325]. Separately, the structur-
al and phase stability, reversibility of electrical conductivity between
oxidation–reduction cycles, chemical and thermal compatibilities
with common electrolytes such as YSZ and LSGM with no phase
change or new phase formation after co-firing with each at 1400 °C
for 10 hours, and a high electronic conductivity of 82 S/cm com-
position at 800 °C and at an oxygen partial pressure of 10−20 atm
were reported for the yttrium-doped strontium titanate of the
Sr0.86Y0.08TiO3 (YST) composition [326].

Nevertheless, high catalytic activity and cell performance require
optimization of microstructural parameters such as porosity, tor-
tuosity, and particle size, spatial distribution and relative loadings
of the active metal or MIEC catalyst with the ionically conducting
solid electrolyte component of the composite anode so that good
electronic percolation is achieved to assure both maximum tpd
density and electrical connectivity in the 3-dimensional porous struc-
ture, as well as chemical and thermal stability of the materials against
the highly reducing gas environment at the anode compartment.
A more detailed discussion of numerous catalytic anode materials
reported for methane conversion reactions is provided below in
Section 4.2.

4.2. Strategies for methane conversion in SOFCs

Methane and natural gas are naturally occurring primary energy
and fuel sources. Unlike the common SOFC fuel H2, which needs to
be produced from other sources in the first place, methane and
natural gas are highly desirable fuels for SOFCs. The environmen-
tal cost of production, compression and transportation, as well as
lack of ready availability of hydrogen pose major obstacles for suc-
cessful commercialization and wider deployment of fuel cells in
general. By contrast, conversion of methane, or natural gas, direct-
ly or indirectly in SOFCs would overcome these major limitations
of efficiency, availability, reliability and cost. However, the key to
achieving efficient electrochemical conversion lies with the devel-
opment of advanced electrocatalytic anodes for methane or natural
gas that exhibit high activity, efficacy, durability, and low cost to
accomplish the difficult challenge of methane electro-oxidation to
CO2 and steam.

Several approaches have been proposed and pursued for methane
utilization and conversion in SOFCs. The major ones include partial
oxidation, oxidative coupling, external or internal reforming, and
direct oxidation. Partial oxidation and oxidative coupling largely aim
for co-generation of power, and chemicals or syngas. As the thrust
of this review article is entirely on power generation and not chem-
ical co-production, only the last three approaches will be discussed
and reviewed below. Also, the term “direct” conversion in this article
will refer to introducing dry methane directly into the SOFC without
any additives such as O2, H2O, and CO2 that can otherwise serve as
the oxygen source. This is elaborated later in Section 4.2.3.

4.2.1. SOFCs fueled by externally reformed methane

Steam reforming of methane to syngas can be achieved either
by external or internal reforming. The syngas is a mixture of H2 and
CO formed by the highly endothermic reforming reaction,

Reaction (3) is typically carried out at elevated temperatures of
800–1000 °C in the presence of a Ni-based catalyst, and usually at
a pressure of about 35 bar. Most commercial SOFCs employ exter-
nal reforming (3), which is carried out in an external stand-alone
fuel processor unit as depicted in Fig. 14. If desired, the reforma-
tion products of reaction (3) may undergo a mildly exothermic
(−41 kJ/mol) two-stage water gas shift (WGS) reaction (5) to in-

hydrogen for the fuel cell stack.

crease the fraction for H2 in syngas while converting most of the
CO to CO2 by further reaction with steam over Fe—Cr alloy cata-
lysts. The first stage of WGS is accomplished at 300–500 °C, while
the second stage is carried out at lower temperatures around 200 °C
to benefit from the Le Chatelier shift to achieve complete conver-
sion of CO to CO2. As a result, methane is converted primarily to
H2 for ease of electro-oxidation in the SOFC and to obtain high cell
performance. Naturally, these extra process steps lead to loss of con-
version efficiency as the steam reforming reaction requires an
endothermic enthalpy change of +206 kJ/mol.

Both external and internal reforming of methane have been under
consideration and development by SOFC developers to supply syngas
to the cell stacks. As internal reforming integrated with a SOFC is
considered to be a more efficient system than coupling to exter-
nal reforming, there has been more attention to the former approach.
In internal reforming, the endothermicity of the reforming reac-
tion helps provide part of the cooling needed for the cell stack, where
the highly exothermic oxidation reactions occur at the anode. Ad-
ditional stack cooling is accomplished by recycling excess air
employed at the cathode up to 3.5–4 times more than the stoichio-
metric requirement.

For external reformer-SOFC systems, on the other hand, the only
means for cooling the cell stack is by dramatically increasing the
airflow through the cathode to about 7.7 times the stoichiometric
amount. This suggests that external reforming will require nearly
twice the amount of excess air at the cathode as internal reform-
ing, which places external reforming at a disadvantage. However,
a modeling study that assumed a hybrid external reformer/SOFC con-
figuration, which is pressurized by a gas turbine and utilizing a
cathode recycle can be as efficient as the internal reforming SOFC
system [327].

The stand-alone fuel reformer technology for external steam re-
forming of methane is mature and commercially available, and falls
outside the scope of this article. Some of the commercial reformer
designs have been reviewed elsewhere [328], and it will not be dis-
cussed here.

Hydrogen derived from external steam reforming of methane or
natural gas has been the desired fuel of choice for most fuel cells
including SOFCs [328]. Kinetic studies of hydrogen oxidation on
metal, cermet, as well as MIEC oxide anodes have been published
widely. Although hydrogen is arguably the simplest and easiest fuel
to oxide, the mechanistic details of its oxidation kinetics remain un-
resolved. Kinetic mechanisms that have been proposed to date are
comparatively reviewed elsewhere [308,329]. As a formal review
of prior work on hydrogen oxidation in SOFC anodes also lies outside
the scope of this article, only the pertinent aspects will be high-
lighted below.

Ongoing debate about the mechanistic nature of H2 oxidation
on SOFC anodes involves different interpretations of the kinetic
results, which were based mostly on the behavior of observed
cell performance (e.g., current density, overvoltage, electrode

impedance, etc.) measured as a function external parameters such
as cell voltage, temperature, or partial pressures of reactants. The
rate of oxidation was reported to be governed by the reaction of
gaseous H2 with the adsorbed oxygen on thin film well-defined Ni
anode surfaces that were patterned in 5-μm wide strips on YSZ elec-
trolyte by photolithography, suggesting an Eley–Rideal type of
reaction mechanism [330]. This group suggested that the oxida-
tion reaction occurred at the tpb, and the rate-determining step was
proposed to be either the dissociative adsorption of reactants or the
surface diffusion of adsorbed species on the Ni surface [331]. In a
different study that also employed patterned Ni anodes, reaction
kinetics was found to be governed by a process with a large acti-
vation barrier of about 0.88 eV, and the proposed catalytic
mechanism involved H2O leading to a hydroxylated YSZ surface that
allows the migration of protons along the YSZ surface toward the
tpb to react with the surface oxygen [265]. For H2 oxidation on Pt
anode on YSZ electrolyte, the rate determining process was pro-
posed to be the exchange of hydroxyl radicals between the Pt and
the YSZ surface at tpb [332]. A similar conclusion is recently ob-
tained by an in operando spectroscopic study that employed
electrochemical imaging of the Pt/YSZ system at 300 mTorr total
pressure and between 550 and 750 °C by spatially resolved x-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (EC-XPS), which reported that the rate
determining step (rds) involved the diffusion of adsorbed H from
Pt to O−
(YSZ) [333]. The study
unambiguously established that the rate-determining step in-
volves H spillover from Pt to YSZ. This sluggish process is purely
chemical in nature, and as expected, not accelerated by the elec-
trical field or cell voltage. The charge transfer step involves electron
hopping from OH−
(YSZ) to Pt across the Pt/YSZ interface, which of
course is accelerated by electrical fields. Based on the EC-XPS results,
the study proposed the following reaction pathway for H2 oxida-
tion on Pt/YSZ:

Electrode kinetics studies using electrochemical impedance spec-
troscopy (EIS) technique also gave divergent results. While H2
oxidation on patterned Ni anodes resulted in one semicircular arc
[331], it resulted in two clearly separated arcs in the case of Ni/
YSZ cermet anodes, indicating two rate limiting processes at the
anode that are in series. The low frequency arc was attributed to
hydrogen dissociation and diffusion on Ni, and the high frequency
arc was ascribed to H transfer from Ni to zirconia surface followed
by charge transfer near tpb [334]. Yet a different study on Ni/YSZ
cermet anodes reported, this time, three semicircular arcs in their
EIS spectra, suggesting three different rate-limiting processes such
that the low frequency arc was associated with a two-electron trans-
fer process, while the medium arc was attributed to adsorption of
water on Ni [319]. In contracts to the low and medium frequency
arcs that exhibited strong dependence on reactant concentration
and anodic overvoltage, the high frequency arc was sensitive to the
cermet microstructure but almost insensitive to reactant pres-
sures and cell potential, and hence, was attributed to transfer of
protons across the Ni/YSZ interface. In this regard, it is important
to maintain control of the electrode microstructure, and pat-
terned electrode studies are helpful to isolate or minimize the

complications arising from microstructural differences and their re-
spective impact on electrode kinetics.

A thermodynamic modeling study invoking equilibrium poten-
tials has considered three reaction pathways for H2 oxidation on Ni
anodes, including oxygen spillover, hydrogen spillover, and inter-
stitial hydrogen transfer, with an intent to reconcile differences in
the reported results [335]. This study suggested, albeit inconclu-
sively, that the strong nonlinear dependence of gas phase H2 and
H2O concentrations is consistent with a rate determining step in-
volving charge transfer during hydrogen spillover from the Ni surface
to a hydroxyl group on YSZ. Recently, an isotopic study employing
Pt, Cu and Ni catalytic cermet anodes with YSZ and GDC electro-
lyte supports concluded that H2 surface exchange and dissociation
occur primarily on the metal catalyst surface of the cermet anode
structure and spillover to the inert oxide support [336].

A direct result of using an external reformer for methane is the
production of syngas, which is the fuel fed into the SOFC stack for
conversion. In that regard, oxidation kinetics of CO + H2 mixtures
have been investigated on various catalytic metal and cermet anode
materials as well as MIEC-based anodes [311,337,338]. As ex-
pected, the oxidation kinetics of CO and H2 are equally important
from the point of view of internal reforming of methane. Natural-
ly, there is also water–gas shift reaction (15) taking place at the
anode, but the rate of this reaction has been reported to be much
faster than the rates of oxidation reactions at the anode [339]. This
assessment may have important implications for SOFC operation
by virtue of the water–gas shift reaction equilibrium. When oper-
ating at high fuel utilization, the local fuel mixture downstream of
the anode increasingly shifts to CO-rich compositions resulting in
increased polarization losses along the fuel flow path, while the in-
creased H2O formation shifts the reaction in favor of H2 formation.
In other words, the fast water–gas shift reaction helps reduce con-
centration polarization [340]. Such dynamic equilibrium that shifts
spatially along the anode requires proper control of fuel composi-
tion, gas flow rates, and cell operation.

It is generally agreed that H2 oxidation kinetics proceed much
faster than CO as represented by a higher polarization resistance
for CO—CO2 mixture on Pt anode than for H2—H2O mixtures [332].
At high CO content exceeding 20% at 800 °C, it is reported that CO
retards the overall anode kinetics for syngas oxidation. As anode
kinetics is strongly dependent on oxygen partial pressure, i.e., oxygen
activity, kinetic experiments that were carried out with H2/H2O and
CO/CO2 gas mixtures at carefully controlled constant oxygen activ-
ity reported that the electrochemical oxidation rates for H2 are nearly
2 times faster than that for CO at 800 °C [339]. This study also re-
ported that the oxidation reaction rates obtained for reformed CH4
on the Ni/YSZ cermet anode at T ~ 800 °C is almost equal to that for
H2—H2O at the same effective oxygen activity, suggesting that H2
oxidation governs overall cell performance for S/C ratio >1. Ni is in-
herently a good catalyst for CO oxidation, but unlike hydrogen, the
inferior kinetics for CO may be due to its inability to spillover from
the metal catalyst on to the YSZ surface. The effect of composition
and dilution effects of H2/H2O and CO/CO2 fuel gas mixtures were
studied on Ni/YSZ cermet anodes using multi-component gas trans-
port models with experimentally measured electrochemical kinetic
parameters [341]. The results showed that as long as the H2 content
of the H2 + CO syngas fuel mixture is high (i.e., >50%), the electro-
chemical performance of the fuel cell is not affected by the presence
of CO, where the water–gas shift reaction plays a major role in re-
ducing anode polarization losses. Regardless, however, higher binary
diffusivities (i.e., lower concentration polarization) of H2—H2O and
faster oxidation kinetics of H2 provide significantly better cell per-
formance than by CO.

Although CO by itself is not considered a desirable fuel for SOFCs
due to its slower oxidation kinetics than H2 and its propensity for
coking, it has recently been demonstrated that it is nevertheless a

viable fuel for SOFCs, achieving high power densities approaching
within 10% for H2 on Ni/YSZ anodes, as well as cell stability with
no carbon deposition under constant current conditions, operat-
ing continuously for nearly 400 h at 850 °C [267]. This is in agreement
with other studies [342]. A recent study on patterned Ni anodes on
YSZ indicated only slightly higher polarization losses for CO than
for H2 oxidation, suggesting similar oxidation mechanisms for these
fuels that challenge the validity of the proton diffusion pathway [343].
A separate study that comparatively investigated the diluent effects
and oxidation kinetics of H2, CO, and syngas on Ni/YSZ and Cu/
GDC cermet anodes reported faster rates for CO oxidation on Co-
added Cu/ceria cermet anodes, where the maximum SOFC power
density for CO was 370 mW/cm2 at 700 °C, while it was 310 mW/
cm2 for H2 on the same anode [344]. This result, however, is in
contradiction with others that consistently reported higher cell per-
formance with H2 oxidation on Ni/YSZ anodes than with CO,
suggesting that the Co-added Cu/ceria cermet anode has better cata-
lytic properties than Ni/YSZ. The implication is that SOFCs employing
dry syngas and Ni/YSZ anode structures can possibly utilize only
the H2 component of the syngas effectively.

4.2.2. Internal reforming of methane in SOFCs

Internal reforming overcomes the need for an external reform-
ing for fuel processing, which adds cost and complexity to the SOFC
operation, and also reduces overall efficiency of the system as dis-
cussed previously in Sections 2.2 and 4.2.1. The heat released by the
electrochemical oxidation reactions of the fuel at the anode helps
drive the endothermic reforming reactions (3) and (4). Under typical
SOFC operating conditions, the heat produced at the anode is sig-
nificantly larger than the heat consumed for the reforming reactions.
Similarly, the cooling load for the cell that is normally provided by
excess air through the cathode compartment is reduced by 50% for
internal reforming as compared to external reforming (see Section
4.2.1. above). As the reforming product H2 (and CO) is readily oxi-
dized at the anode and removed from the reaction environment,
the reforming reactions can proceed well beyond the thermody-
namic equilibrium, as dictated by the Le Chatelier principle. Another
advantage of internal reforming is that H2O and CO2 generated by
the electrochemical oxidation of the reformation product syngas
serves as internal reforming agents for methane, eliminating the need
for an external steam generator. The high operating temperature
of SOFCs also helps promote the endothermic reforming reactions
(5) and (6) to proceed faster. On the other hand, internal steam re-
forming poses technical challenges in several areas: (1) high
propensity for carbon deposition, or coking, that deactivates the cata-
lysts and anodes, (2) requirement for the use of large steam-to-
carbon (S/C) ratios generally ≥3 to minimize or eliminate coking, (3)

thermal stresses due to large temperature gradients that can develop
across the cell by the cooling effect of the reforming reactions.

Several terminologies are frequently employed in the litera-
ture to distinguish different internal reforming configurations. Pre-
reforming is sometimes used to describe partial reforming of
methane prior to introduction on to the catalytic SOFC anode. In
indirect internal reforming (IIR), most of the reforming reaction takes
place in a catalytic passage generally located in between the cells
before methane enters the anode. The advantage of IIR is that the
physically separated catalytic anode may be made of a different ma-
terial than the reforming catalyst used in the passage. This situation
is quite different from direct internal reforming (DIR), where the
anode serves the dual function as both the reforming catalyst and
the oxidation catalyst to accomplish the chemical reforming reac-
tion as well as the electrochemical oxidation of the reforming
products H2 and CO. Another configuration, called gradual inter-
nal reforming (GIR), involves a porous catalytic layer for the reforming
reaction added on top of the anode, whereby separating the cata-
lytic reactions from the electrochemical oxidation reactions as
depicted in Fig. 15. In fact, this approach has been tested success-
fully for nearly 200 h of stable operation with humidified CH4 under
current carrying conditions, although with modest cell perfor-
mance of less than 60 mW/cm2 of maximum power density obtained
at 900 °C [345].

Ni-based cermet anodes have been used widely for this purpose,
as Ni is a good hydrocarbon cracking catalyst and is inexpensive.
But by the same token, Ni promotes coking, or carbon deposition,
which leads to rapid deactivation of the anode and degradation of
cell performance. For this reason, excess steam with steam-to-
carbon ratios (S/C) that may be as high as 3.0 or above are employed
to minimize coking by moving the overall gas composition outside
the thermodynamic carbon deposition region in the C—H—O equi-
librium diagram (see Section 5.1). Beside thermodynamic
considerations, the catalytic effect of the anode material also plays
a role in carbon deposition, as well as the nature of the support ma-
terial due to metal–support interactions discussed above (see Section
3.1.1). For example, carbon deposition during methane internal re-
forming over Ni/scandia-stabilized zirconia (ScSZ) cermet anode was
found to be significantly less than for Ni/YSZ cermet anodes, which
was still less than the Ni/samaria-doped ceria (SDC) cermet anode,
while the Ru/YSZ cermet anode gave the overall best results pos-
sibly because, unlike Ni, Ru does not dissolve carbon [346]. Naturally,
the use of high S/C ratios that may avoid or discourage carbon de-
position also comes with several negative consequences. Strong
adsorption of H2O becomes more pronounced at high steam partial
pressures, which results in deactivation of the catalytic Ni surface,
or in extreme cases, may even lead to the formation of NiO.

Maintaining such high S/C ratios in SOFCs may require the use of
external steam generators, which demand additional energy for
steam generation and, hence, reduce overall efficiency.

Most studies on internal reforming of methane on SOFC cata-
lytic anodes have preferentially involved steam as the gasifying agent.
However, dry reforming with CO2 was also employed, and re-
viewed recently elsewhere [347–350]. Rhodium catalyst–support
interactions during dry reforming of methane studied systemati-
cally by varying the acid character of the support oxide, not only
highlighted the role of lattice oxygen spillover on to the Rh surface
but also achieved the highest conversion with the Rh/YSZ catalyst
system while the MgO support, which is a basic oxide, provided the
lowest activity [113,351].

The reforming product syngas components undergo oxidation
at the anode, which involves both H2 and CO oxidation kinetics and
their competing reaction mechanisms to access surface active sites.
This also involves diffusion and mass transport to and from the cata-
lytic sites of the reactants CH4, H2 and CO, and their oxidation
products H2O and CO2 within the pores of the cermet anode struc-
ture. In addition, the reaction products H2O and CO2 undergo further
reforming reactions with methane on the catalytic anode surface
as well as in the gas phase.

Optical in situ spectroscopies such as Raman and infrared imaging
developed in the last decade have been extremely helpful in ex-
amining surface intermediates and temperature variations during
hydrocarbon and H2 oxidation reactions on SOFC anodes [352].
Indeed, a recent study using electrochemical measurements coupled
with gas phase vibrational Raman [353] and Fourier transform in-
frared emission (FTIRES) spectroscopies of both methane and ethanol
internal steam reforming on Ni/YSZ cermet anode at 700–800 °C in-
dicated that reforming proceeds both in the gas phase and on the
catalytic anode surface [354], and that adsorbed CO2)ad on the Ni
surface is identified as an intermediate of the CH4 oxidation reac-
tion as well as for the oxidation of the surface carbon via
electrochemically pumped oxygen [355,356].

A comparative study of methane internal reforming with S/C
ratios between 0 and 3 on Ni/YSZ and Ni/GDC cermet anodes in-
dicated no difference in the reforming activities of the two anodes
at 950 °C and the gas compositions were in chemical equilibrium
[357]. At this temperature, most of the endothermic reforming re-
actions were nearly complete within the first half of the anode length
along the flow direction, which may lead the cell cracking due to
deleterious thermal stresses. Indeed, achieving complete reform-
ing can induce large temperature gradients, some of which can be
mitigated by a pre-reforming operation. Temperature distribution
measurements using near infrared thermal (NIR) imaging of anode
surfaces in a 10 kW SOFC stack indicated local variations in tem-
perature average around 4 °C/mm for S/C = 4 and 6 along the Ni/
YSZ cermet anode, but for the case of S/C = 3, the variation was >20 °C
within the first 4 mm of the anode length [358]. These large thermal
gradients are certainly of major concern for the structural and
thermal stabilities of stack design.

Similar results were reported by an independent study involv-
ing in situ measurement of gas phase compositions at 700 °C during
steam internal reforming of methane using vibrational Raman spec-
troscopy, where surface temperature differences between the anode
entrance and exit may reach 30–35 °C [359]. NIR and FTIRES studies
of methane and biogas oxidation on Ni cermet anodes, the cooling
effect of the endothermic reforming reactions for methane and biogas
have dropped the local anode surface temperature, respectively, by
1–4 °C and 12–14 °C, regardless of cell polarization [360]. Much of
the in situ analytical and diagnostic methods to probe the SOFC
anode kinetics have recently been reviewed [352].

An experimental study of cell stability and performance back by
modeling of SOFC transport, chemistry and electrochemistry on ox-
idation of humidified CH4 (~3% H2O), dry reforming (75% CH4 + 25%

CO2), and methane partial oxidation (75% CH4 + 25% air) reactions
reported that cell stability is greatly affected by coking and thermal
gradients that can lead to mechanical cracking [361]. Stable cell op-
eration was observed under galvanostatic conditions at 800 °C over
8 h for both 75% CH4 + 25% CO2 and 75% CH4 + 25% air mixtures at
high current densities (>1 A/cm2), but increasingly more severe cell
degradation with decreasing current density. On the other hand, de-
creasing the cell operating temperature helped enhance cell stability,
as expected. These results were in agreement with coking being re-
sponsible for the observed cell degradation. The modeling results
also indicated that there are significant temperature gradients as
much as 6.6 °C/mm (or, 4 °C over 0.6 mm) across the anode, which
is in good qualitative agreement with the gradients measured by
NIR above. This modeling study also showed that such thermal gra-
dients, which are primarily due to the endothermic nature of the
internal reforming reaction, could be eliminated by employing an
inert interlayer (such as partially stabilized zirconia) between the
YSZ electrolyte and the porous anode [361,362]. This inert inter-
layer also mitigates coking by impeding the transport of CH4 into
and H2 out of the porous Ni/YSZ anode structure, thus slowing down
the reforming reaction and decreasing the critical current needed
for stable cell operation without coking. This is an important con-
sideration from a practical point of view for employing SOFCs for
generation of electricity and production of syngas/chemicals using
methane oxidation, reforming or transformation reactions on Ni/
YSZ anodes without coking problems.

Despite much progress, there is yet no consensus on the inter-
nal reforming reaction pathways and mechanisms due to the
complexity of the reaction system and the difficulty in determin-
ing the individual elementary steps [363]. Several reaction
mechanisms, including first order kinetics with respect to methane,
L–H type kinetics [364], as well as power law expressions [365]
have been proposed. In a series of rigorous studies using isotopic
measurements, it was reported that the reaction kinetics was first
order with respect to the methane partial pressure but practically
independent of the respective partial pressures of reforming agents
H2O or CO2. This is depicted in Fig. 16 for Pt/ZrO2, Ru/Al2O3, and
Ni/MgO supported catalysts, and shows linear behavior of reac-
tion rate with CH4 pressure but indicates lack of dependence on
H2O, CO2, H2 or CO partial pressures. In all cases studied, the C—H
bond activation was found to be the slow step for both reforming
reactions as well as the CH4 decomposition reaction on Ni/MgO
catalysts [366], Rh catalysts supported on Al2O3 and ZrO2 [367],
and on other noble catalysts including Pt and Ir, and Ru [368,369].
The results suggest that the water gas shift reaction is sufficiently
fast and equilibrates readily, as the reformation rates were practi-
cally unaffected by the CO2 or H2O contents. Based on their systematic
study of isotopic effects and reaction kinetics on several sup-
ported metal catalysts, this research group proposed a first order
reaction rate with respect to methane. The activation energies and
turnover rates, i.e., frequencies, for methane internal reforming on
Pt, Ru, Rh, and Ni catalysts are summarized in Table 5. Clearly, Pt
is the best performing reforming catalyst among the others studied,
with significantly lower activation energy. The reaction mecha-
nism includes a sequence of elementary steps for hydrogen
abstraction toward the formation of chemisorbed carbon and hy-
drogen species on the catalyst surface. The following elementary
steps and surface intermediates on that Ru/Al2O3 catalyst were pro-
posed [369]:

However, this view was challenged by other studies that re-
ported dependence of the reaction rate on the partial pressure of
both the products and the reactants [218,365,370]. A detailed anal-
ysis considered a large number of reaction mechanisms for methane
steam reforming on Ni/MgO catalyst, and proposed a L–H type of
mechanism [371] that postulated the reaction rate is dependent of
the partial pressures of methane, hydrogen and water vapor, and
also the rate determining step is governed by the reaction between
the adsorbed carbon and oxygen species according to the reac-
tions below.

Steam reforming kinetics on catalytic Ni film and Ni/YSZ cermet
anodes in SOFCs indicated a L–H type dependence on the partial
pressures of methane and water vapor, and suggested competitive
adsorption of carbonaceous and oxygen species, or OH [364]. Much
of the previously reported studies have been reviewed recently
[203,363,372]. Kinetic studies of methane internal steam reform-
ing reaction on Ni/YSZ cermet anode in a plug-flow tubular SOFC
at 700–1000 °C and for partial pressures PCH4 = 2–40 kPa, PH2 = 10–
70 kPa, and Psteam = 10–70 kPa at Ptotal = 1 atm indicated that the
reaction rate expression was first order with respect to methane,
and showed a weak dependence on hydrogen but a strong nega-
tive dependence on steam [370]. Oxidation as well as steam
reforming of methane on Ni/YSZ cermet anodes exhibited signifi-
cantly different kinetic behavior than that on Fe/YSZ anodes [373].
While only small amounts of H2 and CO were produced on Fe/YSZ
anode due possibly to oxidation of Fe, the catalytic activity of Ni/
YSZ anode exhibited high activity producing large quantities of H2
and CO under low humidity (0 < H2O/CH4 < 1) conditions, and no
carbon deposition was observed under current carrying condi-
tions, indicating the role of lattice oxygen in removing surface carbon.
It is clear from the preceding discussion that there is still no con-
sensus yet on the mechanistic details of the internal reforming
kinetics on metal catalyst surfaces. The degree of catalyst disper-
sion on the support material and catalyst particle size, diffusional
and mass transport effects, metal–support interactions, and oper-
ational parameters used in these studies may all influence the kinetic
results and the proposed reaction mechanism.

Another important consideration has to do with significant varia-
tions in the temperature distribution in the cell during internal
reforming [358–360]. The endothermic enthalpy change of the re-

forming reaction as well as carbon deposition due to cracking, or
pyrolysis, of methane on the catalyst surface leads to degradation
in cell performance. Hence, it was suggested that some degree of
external reforming may be helpful to remove particularly higher hy-
drocarbons that inherently have higher propensity for cracking than
methane [202].

Coking, or carbon deposition due to the cracking of methane, and
other hydrocarbons, presents one of the major technical difficul-
ties in achieving effective internal reforming without cell degradation
and loss of performance. This problem becomes detrimental espe-
cially at low current densities and low steam-to-carbon (S/C) ratios.
However, oxidation of simulated steam reforming gases of CO and
H2 on Ni/YSZ cermet anodes indicated that the best SOFC perfor-
mance was achieved with S/C ratio = 0.5 at 950 °C, and single cell
experiments over several weeks showed only slight carbon depo-
sition on the reference electrode at the anode side and on the Ni
current collector, again suggesting the role of lattice oxygen in re-
moving surface carbon [342]. Stability of the Ni/YSZ cermet anodes
were also tested galvanostatically in dry flowing methane at 400 mA/
cm2 current density at 950 °C for with only 70 mV reduction in
performance over 1000 h. On the other hand, it has been reported
in the literature that S/C ratios sometimes as high as 3–5 may be
required to avoid carbon deposition over Ni/YSZ anodes [374]. Several
SOFC cermet anode compositions were investigated for carbon tol-
erance for internal steam reforming of methane and propane, and
indicated that Ru/ScSZ cermet anode has better carbon tolerance
than Ni/YSZ [346]. It was also suggested that electrochemical
pumping at sufficiently high current densities could effectively
remove the carbon deposits from the anode surface via oxidation
[227,375]. Indeed, no carbon deposition was observed during CO
oxidation on Ni/YSZ anodes under galvanostatic conditions at
414 mW/cm2 at 850 °C for 375 h of continuous operation without
any discernable degradation in SOFC performance [267]. Using in-
ternal steam reforming with 97% CH4 + 3% H2O fuel mixture on Ni/
scandia-stabilized zirconia cermet anode, a maximum power density
of 640 mW/cm2 was achieved at 900 °C, and the cell performance
was stable over 150 hours at 500 mA/cm2 current density, while deg-
radation of cell performance due to carbon deposition was observed
at 800 °C operation [376]. The results suggest that the collective
actions of high temperatures and high current densities may be re-
quired for electrochemical removal of carbon deposits.

As an effective cracking catalyst for hydrocarbons, Ni has suffi-
cient solubility for carbon that promotes coking on Ni-cermet anodes
in SOFCs. One strategy to reduce the propensity for coking is to
reduce the activity of Ni by alloying it with a metal such as Cu or
Au that lacks catalytic activity for cracking or for activation of C—H
bonds. Indeed, NiAu alloy-cermet anode containing 1 at% Au was
tested for methane rich steam reforming conditions in the SOFC at
temperatures 700–900 °C and showed high tolerance to coking even
at a methane-to-steam ratio of 3 [377]. At a constant cell voltage
of 500 mV corresponding to a cell current density of about 300 mA/
cm2, the cell current remained practically unchanged during the
60 hours of stability testing at 850 °C, indicating lack of degrada-
tion and improved carbon tolerance. Similarly, YSZ- and CeO2-
based cermet anodes containing Cu or NiCu alloy have been
developed for oxidation of hydrocarbons with stable cell perfor-
mance over hundreds of hours [23,311–314,378–380]. Cu—Co–
ceria anode also showed stable SOFC operation in simulated biogas
environment at 750 °C with humidified H2, CH4 and H2S additions
for nearly 740 hours, but the anode was found to be a mixture of
the fluorite structure CuxCoyCe1 − x − yO2 − δ phase with CuO and Co3O4,
making it difficult to identify the active phase responsible for the
observed stability [381]. In general, Cu-based anodes have been ef-
fective in mitigating hydrocarbon cracking and minimizing carbon
deposition in SOFCs as Cu is a poor catalyst for C—C bond forma-
tion and does not dissolve carbon, but at the same time, Cu is a poor

catalyst for activating the C—H bond and hence requires the addi-
tion of an active catalyst to achieve methane oxidation. In most cases,
CeO2 is employed in connection with Cu as the catalytically active
component of the cermet anode composition.

Catalytically active MIEC-based oxide anodes provide another op-
portunity to move completely away from the conventional Ni-
based anodes, or other transition metals such as Fe, that promote
cracking and carbon deposition on the SOFC anode surface during
steam internal reforming of methane. It was reported that Ni-free
La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3 anode material was redox stable and exhib-
ited electrochemical performance (200 mW/cm2 at 900 °C for CH4
with 3% H2O) comparable to that of Ni/YSZ cermets for methane ox-
idation without the need for excess steam [197]. Despite its redox
stability, however, the electronic conductivity of this material is not
sufficiently high under reducing conditions (~1 S/cm at 900 °C in
wet H2) but has tolerance to sulfur especially for the high Cr content
composition La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.6Mn0.4O3, but shows several decomposi-
tion products when the lower Cr-content composition
La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.4Mn0.6O3 is exposed to 10% H2S containing humidi-
fied H2 at 950 °C for 5 days [321]. Improvement in cell performance
and sulfur tolerance was reported by employing Sr2Mg1 − xMnxMoO6 − δ
double-perovskite anodes on the 300 μm thick LSGM electrolyte.
Best cell performance with methane was obtained with the
Sr2MgMoO6 − δ composition, which achieved a maximum power
density of 438 mW/cm2 at 800 °C for dry CH4 and 338 mW/cm2 for
wet (3% H2O + 97% CH4) methane [322]. La substitution on the Sr-
site in Sr2MgMoO6 − δ (SLMM) has provided further improvement in
cell performance, where the maximum power density values for the
Sr1.2La0.8MgMoO6 − δ anode composition increased from the previ-
ous 438 mW/cm2 to 543 mW/cm2 at 800 °C for dry CH4, and from
338 mW/cm2 to 550 mW/cm2 for wet (3% H2O + 97% CH4) methane
[382]. It was proposed that the Mo+6/Mo+5 redox couple, as well as
cation ordering are important for catalytic activity, and that La-
substitution decreased the Mg/Mo ordering parameter rendering
the less ordered LSMM electrochemically more active. Signifi-
cantly better SOFC performance and coking resistance were obtained
for Ni/La0.1Ce0.9Oy cermet catalytic anodes employed for internal
steam reforming of methane that resulted in high power densities
up to 850 mW/cm2 at 650 °C [383], as shown in Fig. 17. Nearly com-
plete methane conversion was achieved for T > 800 °C, and methane
conversion at a low steam-to-carbon ratio of 0.25 remained stable
for nearly 280 hours over Ni/La0.1Ce0.9Oy catalytic anode at T < 650 °C.
High catalytic activity for methane conversion under low humid-
ity conditions was also demonstrated on a member of the titanate-
based perovskite family, namely in La4Sr8Ti11Mn0.5Ga0.5O37.5 (LSTMG)-
based YSZ composite anodes, which exhibited a high concentration
of disordered oxygen defects in its crystal lattice that was key to
its redox properties [384]. Furthermore, the study demonstrated a

remarkably low polarization resistance of 0.36 Ω.cm2 for this anode
material giving a maximum cell power density of 350 mW/cm2 at
950 °C in 97.7% CH4 + 2.3% H2O fuel mixture, which was not much
lower than the 500 mW/cm2 obtained for 97.7% H2 + 2.3% H2O fuel
mixture on the same composite anode at the same temperature.
Effect of catalytic promoters based on alkaline earth metal oxides
added in small quantities up to 10 mol% to Ni/YSZ cermet SOFC
anodes for steam internal reforming reported that SrO and CaO ad-
dition was effective in reducing coking, while promoting the methane
reforming reaction nearly as effectively as the control Ni/YSZ cermet
anode [385]. At 800 °C, methane conversion was nearly complete
at >99% on all tested anodes, and carbon deposition was signifi-
cantly reduced by the addition of CaO and SrO to Ni/YSZ cermet.
It was proposed that the addition of these strongly basic oxides modi-
fied the electronic structure of metallic Ni to a more cationic state,
thus suppressing coking. However, the benefits gained by the ad-
dition of these alkali earth oxides came at the expense of slight
reduction in fuel cell performance.

There have also been modeling studies to understand and map
out the parameter space for optimum operating conditions for SOFCs
fueled by internally reformed syngas [386,387]. A thermody-
namic study of a tubular SOFC stack fueled by internally reformed
methane provided insight into the importance of effective man-
agement of heat losses in the stack, and assuming an efficient stack
design for air preheat and heat recovery from flue gases has pre-
dicted a first law conversion efficiency of 52% based on lower heating
value (LLV), and a second law efficiency of 86% (LLV) [388]. The mis-
match between the moderately endothermic internal steam
reforming reaction (3) and the highly exothermic oxidation reac-
tions of syngas components H2 and CO gives rise to non-uniform
temperature distribution in the SOFC that may lead to mechanical
failure of the cell due to induced thermal stress. A mathematical
model was developed to investigate the benefits of adding small
amounts of oxygen to internal steam reforming of methane in the
feed to maintain autothermal reaction [389]. Although oxygen ad-
dition was found to be beneficial for lowering the demand for steam
while achieving smoother temperature distribution and reduced
cooling at the reformer entrance, it resulted in lowering the elec-
trical cell efficiency.

Most modeling studies for internal reforming in SOFCs usually
employ empirically derived rate expressions and omit surface

chemistry of intermediates. To bridge this knowledge gap, a recent
modeling study revealed for the first time that incorporating the
surface chemistry during the reforming reactions provides a more
detailed understanding and helps explain the capacitive effects pre-
viously observed by EIS for anode polarization [390]. A related
modeling study for co-generation using partial oxidation of methane
in an anode-supported tubular SOFC geometry explored the ben-
efits of introducing a chemical barrier layer on top of the Ni-
based anode catalytic layer that can impede the outward diffusion
and trap the electrochemically generated steam inside the pores of
the anode structure [362]. As this is expected to maintain a suffi-
ciently high S/C ratio on a local basis, the addition of the chemical
barrier layer indeed helps prevent coking on the Ni cermet. The
model also suggested that the barrier layer should not cover the
entire anode length of the tubular SOFC but only a section at
the upstream of the anode surface, and that the cell operational pa-
rameters would largely dictate the length of the barrier layer.
Although the barrier layer is expected to compromise cell perfor-
mance especially along the downstream section of the anode surface,
this approach nevertheless presents the possibility of utilizing
methane as the primary fuel directly in SOFCs without significant
coking.

Another study considered counter-flow and co-flow configura-
tions in their model to achieve autothermal operation of SOFC by
thermally coupling the loads for the endothermic steam reform-
ing reaction with the exothermic anodic oxidation reaction, and
reported cooling at the reformer entrance, which is undesirable for
SOFC operation [391]. Methane internal reforming study modeled
for 75% methane utilization in SOFCs operating at 750 °C pre-
dicted a power density of 330 mW/cm2 and 47% fuel efficiency [392].
A 3-dimensional model was developed for an anode-supported
planar SOFC operating at 800 °C with internal reforming to under-
stand the role of recycling the anode product gases back to SOFC
in order to lower the temperature gradients and to reduce the
amount of coking at the anode [393]. A co-flow system with 75%
methane utilization at 0.65 A/cm2 of current density and 0.7 V was
considered in this model. The results indicated large temperature
gradients exist both along the length of the cell (up to 16 °C/cm)
and across the thickness of the cell (up to 35 °C/cm) particularly near
the gas inlet, which can be reduced significantly to 10 °C/cm and
11 °C/cm, respectively, by recycling 75% of the anode exhaust.
However, this high recycling ratio lowers cell performance by re-
ducing the relative amount of H2, and instead, 60% recycling was
suggested as an optimum value.

Anode gas recycling not only lowers temperature gradients in
the cell but also eliminates the need for an external steam gener-
ator as the product gases provide the internal steam cycle [394].
Unlike direct internal reforming (DIR) that requires large quanti-
ties of steam at the fuel inlet, a modeling study predicted that the
gradual internal reforming (GIR) approach, which internally gen-
erates its steam through the electrochemical oxidation of the
reformation product H2 at the SOFC anode, gives better outcomes
than DIR with no loss of cell performance, lower temperature gra-
dients and reduced carbon deposition [395]. However, an
experimental study reported that steam-rich conditions at the of
Ni—YSZ—CeO2 anode led to cell degradation due to NiO forma-
tion, while its catalytic activity was found to be still higher than the
Ni—YSZ cermet anode [365].

Possibility of recycling the anode product CO2 provides oppor-
tunities for innovation and has generated renewed interest in dry
internal reforming using CO2 as the gasifying agent, especially for
the prospects of using biogas. In experiments using CH4—CO2 mix-
tures simulating biogas on Ni-cermet electrodes, internal reforming
SOFC performance reached maximum performance at the CH4/
CO2 feed ratio of unity, resulting in a modest power density of only
51 mW/cm2 at 875 °C [396]. For CO2/CH4 <1, no deactivation due to

carbon deposition was observed. Methane conversion rate consis-
tently showed a maximum with methane partial pressure of around
5 kPa suggesting competitive adsorption of CO2 and CH4 on the Ni
catalyst, which is indicative of L–H type kinetics. In similar dry in-
ternal reforming experiments using CH4—CO2 mixtures, 50 hours
of stable SOFC operation at 1000 °C and 200 mA/cm2 was re-
ported on Ni/scandia-stabilized zirconia cermet anodes without
carbon deposition, suggesting again that carbon deposits can be
removed electrochemically from the anode surface [375].

4.2.2.1. Electrochemical promotion of methane by NEMCA effect. As
discussed in detail in Section 3.1.1, the NEMCA effect can signifi-
cantly enhance catalytic rates of methane oxidation on the anode
electrocatalysts beyond the Faradaic limit by tuning the work func-
tion of the metal catalyst and hence the surface binding energy of
adsorbates via an externally applied current or potential to the elec-
trochemical cell. An early study employed a methane–oxygen
mixture with respective partial pressures of PCH4 = 2.6 kPa and
PO2 = 1.9 kPa over Pd film catalysts deposited on the YSZ electro-
lyte of an electrochemical cell configuration CH4, O2, CO2, Pd/YSZ/
Au, CH4, O2, CO2, where the catalytic rate of methane oxidation at
400 °C was enhanced by electrochemical pumping up to a factor of
150 higher than the Faradic rate otherwise expected from the elec-
trochemical supply of oxide ions on to the Pd catalyst [397]. This
was attributed to the reverse spillover of oxide ions under the in-
fluence of the positive overvoltage from the YSZ on to the Pd catalyst,
almost fully covering its surface. These reverse spillover oxide ions
that form a neutral double layer on Pd/gas interface (see Fig. 5) are
strongly bonded to Pd and less reactive toward CH4 than chemisorbed
oxygen, and merely serve as promoters to affect the binding strength
of chemisorbed O2 and CH4 on Pd. As the positive potential in-
creases, the work function of Pd also increases which leads to
weakening of the Pd—O binding strength of the dissociatively
chemisorbed oxygen. Decreased coverage of the Pd surface from
strongly bonded oxygen makes room for dissociative chemisorp-
tion of CH4. The reaction was also reported to obey the L–H
mechanism with first order kinetics with respect to methane and
zero order with respect to oxygen.

More recently, similar results of electrochemical promotion of
methane oxidation reaction on Pd/YSZ anode with enhanced CO2
formation were reported, where an enhancement ratio of 18 was
achieved for CH4 consumption with Faradic efficiencies up to 1400
[398]. Electrochemical promotion of methane oxidation was further
extended to include ceria as part of the anode cermet component.
Methane oxidation in excess oxygen at 320–450 °C using a
1.3%CH4 + 4.5%O2 reaction gas mixture on Pd-impregnated Pd—CeO2/
YSZ and Pd/YSZ anodes reported enhanced electrochemical
promotion on Pd/YSZ anode under electrochemical pumping, and
reasonable catalytic activities for the two anodes under OCV con-
ditions with improved OCV values in the presence of ceria, but
failed to achieve electrochemical promotion, i.e., the NEMCA effect,
on the Pd—CeO2/YSZ anode at either anodic or cathodic poten-
tials, unless a small amount of C2H4 at 0.3 kPa pressure was also
co-fed into the cell along with the methane–oxygen mixture [399].
The high catalytic activity but lack of electrochemical promotion
on the Pd—CeO2/YSZ anode was attributed to the intrinsically high
activity of ceria that can thermally supply the reverse spillover of
oxide ions to the Pd surface possibly faster than the electrochemi-
cal migration rate driven by the potential, such that the electro-
migration effect did not play a significant role in the overall rate
of reverse spillover.

Expanding the temperature regime this time to 470–600 °C,
similar results were reported for electrochemical promotion of
methane oxidation in excess oxygen (0.4%CH4 + 1.0%O2) on Pd—CeO2/
YSZ and Pd/YSZ anodes, where catalytic activity under OCV
conditions of the Pd—CeO2/YSZ anode was found to be nearly 14

times higher than that for Pd/YSZ, and a NEMCA effect of 1.33 was
observed at 470 °C for the Pd—CeO2/YSZ anode [400]. Recently, elec-
trochemical promotion was extended to natural gas oxidation and
using an inlet gas composition of 15% O2, 5.3% CH4, 0.24% C2H6, 0.07%
C3H8 (balance He) over impregnated Pd/YSZ anode at 340–420 °C,
NEMCA enhancement factors of 2.7 and 2.1 were reported for CH4
oxidation and CO2 formation rates, respectively, demonstrating that
electrochemical promotion of natural gas combustion is possible
at such low temperatures [401].

Interestingly, the general concept of electrochemical promo-
tion was extended into a primarily catalytic MIEC-based membrane
reactor, where the operating principle of ion transport is not elec-
trochemical but entirely chemical in nature and is based on the oxide
ion transport through the mixed conducting oxide under the chem-
ical potential difference of oxygen across the membrane. Employing
such a chemical reactor made of hallow fiber La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3
tubular membrane coated with a thin film Pt catalyst layer exposed
to an ethylene–oxygen reaction gas mixture of PC2H4 = 0.5 kPa and
PO2 = 1.5 kPa at 500 °C, a modest enhancement in non-Faradaic mod-
ification of ethylene oxidation rate was reported using this wireless-
NEMCA effect [402]. It was envisioned that the mixed oxide ion and
electron hole transporting La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 would supply the
reverse spillover oxide ions to the Pt catalyst surface to accom-
plish the oxidation reaction, albeit with a rather limited NEMCA
effect.

4.2.3. Direct electro-oxidation of methane

There have also been great interest in direct utilization and
electro-oxidation of methane and other hydrocarbons in SOFCs for
power generation [28,29,131,197,216,312,403–405] as well as to
achieve electrochemical transformations for chemical synthesis
[42,43,131] in SOFC-based electrochemical reactors. Naturally, direct
conversion eliminates many of the inefficiencies of external and in-
ternal reforming that complicate the overall process by additional
steps and a more complex balance of plant. Direct electro-oxidation

is conceptually simple as depicted in Fig. 18, but from mechanis-
tic and practical points of view it is challenging to achieve. In
principle, the oxygen needed to oxidize methane is supplied through
the solid oxide electrolyte such that the product flue gases after con-
version are made primarily of H2O and CO2, where the latter can
be readily captured for storage after condensing out the steam. This
is obviously a desirable outcome, but by the same token, these very
same products may in turn undergo steam and dry reforming re-
actions with methane in the gas phase as well as on the catalytic
anode surface, which are primarily chemical steps in nature and in-
troduce complications for selectively constraining the electrochemical
reaction only to methane oxidation, as both CO and H2 are also right-
ful fuels for the anodic reactions.

For the ideal case of direct electro-oxidation of methane, the net
half-cell reactions at the cathode and anode, as well as the overall
cell reaction, are given by,

As the electrochemical oxidation of methane would involve the
transfer of eight electrons as indicated in the half-cell net reaction
(39), it is quite likely that the electro-oxidation reaction can only
be accomplished in a sequence of elementary steps [23,404]. Fur-
thermore, it is clear from the discussions of methane catalysis in
the earlier sections that the first step in methane oxidation in-
volves the activation of the C—H bond followed by successive
abstraction of hydrogen to form carbonaceous surface species. These
are purely chemical steps and not electrochemical in nature. So, the
mechanistic sequence for methane electro-oxidation involves both
chemical reactions and electron transfer steps at the anode. It was,
hence, argued that the terminology of “direct electrochemical

28

T.M. Gür/Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 54 (2016) 1–64

utilization” can be used in this broad sense, even for internally re-
forming SOFCs [312].

It should be noted that in sections preceding this, discussions
about methane oxidation or reforming always involved co-feeding
of reactants O2, H2O, or CO2 along with methane into the SOFC. In
this section and hereafter, however, the term “direct” electro-
oxidation implies that no reactants other than the methane fuel is
fed directly into the anode chamber of the SOFC, and that the oxide
ion flux through the solid oxide electrolyte of the SOFC is the only
source for oxygen needed for the electro-oxidation reaction. This
interpretation of “direct” oxidation may be slightly more restric-
tive but in principle in line with other suggestions made previously
for the use of proper terminology regarding the utilization of gaseous
[23,312], liquid [23,406], and solid fuels [407] in SOFCs. In some cases,
though, the terminology “direct conversion” is employed in the lit-
erature even when a small amount (≤3%) of O2 or H2O is co-fed along
with methane into the SOFC. To avoid confusion, these studies will
be explicitly identified as such in the following discussion.

As documented in previous sections, theoretical and experi-
mental evidence agrees that the biggest energy barrier on the
reaction pathway to methane oxidation is posed by the initial break-
age of the first C—H bond to form an adsorbed methyl group,
followed by subsequent hydrogen abstraction. Density functional
theory (DFT) calculations for CH4 oxidation on the Ni (111) surface
indicated that C—H activation occurs on top of the surface Ni atom
and its energy barrier is found to be 105 kJ/mol [408,409]. The se-
quential dehydrogenation of methane on Ni surface indicated that
the adsorbed CHx (where, x = 0–3) species prefer 3-fold sites on Ni
(111) and also lower the work function of Ni, indicating that elec-
trons are transferred from the adsorbed CHx species into Ni that
leaves the adsorbed species positively charged [410].

In general, metal atoms located in low coordination number sites
such as steps, edges, kinks and corners interact more strongly with
adsorbates than atoms located on close packed surfaces with high
coordination number sites such as flat surfaces and terraces. DFT
calculations for methane dehydrogenation over various transition
metal surfaces indicated that electronic effects largely dominate the
catalytic behavior [411]. This is illustrated in Fig. 19, where for
example, the step atoms on Ni (211) shift the adsorption energy
slightly to the left of the flat Ni (111) surface. It should be noted
that when the change in geometry shifts the point for any metal
along the horizontal axis, then this indicates a purely electronic effect,
or likewise, purely geometrical if shifted along the vertical axis. The
step atoms on Ni (211) have lower metal coordination numbers than
those on the close packed (111) surface, and make stronger bonds
with intermediates as well as the transition state, and hence de-
crease the activation barrier. It is clear from Fig. 19 that C—H bond
activation for methane oxidation is largely governed by electronic
effects, and not particularly sensitive to geometrical factors. From
a practical point of view, this would imply that design and surface
engineering of many metal catalysts may not have a major impact
on catalytic activity.

DFT studies also predicted that the barrier height for C—H ac-
tivation is significantly lower at step edges where the CHx is bound
more strongly than on a terrace site, and that blocking the step edge
sites with sulfur weakens the binding energy of CHx and increases
the energy barrier for activation [408]. Interestingly, this inhibit-
ing effect was exploited for suppressing carbon deposition on Ni/
YSZ cermet anodes, where the highly active Ni edge sites were
blocked off intentionally by sulfur deposition prior to ethanol ox-
idation. The resulting Ni—Sx surface showed significant resistance
to coking and still had good catalytic activity due to the active sites
available on the terraces, generating a significant power density of
400 mW/cm2 at 850 °C in ethanol fuel [412].

It is clear that the nature of the catalytic anode material, its elec-
tronic structure, composition, microstructure, and surface properties

tively. Note that the stepped surfaces (upper left inset) in general show slightly higher
dissociation barrier than the closed packed (111) flat surface (lower right inset).
However, the electronic effect (indicated by arrow) is significantly more pro-
nounced than the geometrical effect. [Reprinted with permission from Ref. 411:

are important considerations for successful electro-oxidation of
methane with practically significant SOFC performance. The salient
features and requirements for effective anode materials are already
discussed in detail
in excellent reviews published earlier
[311,313,314,317,380]. A wide variety of catalytic anode materials
have been reported for methane oxidation in SOFCs, including oxides.
One of the early, perhaps the first, study reported for methane ox-
idation on an oxide anode in SOFCs, employed the electronically
conducting anode material Bi2O3—Pr6O11 [216]. Dry methane oxi-
dation on pyrochlore-structure La2Sn2O7—Ni—Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 (GDC)
composite anodes was investigated and high catalytic activity with
a significant power density of 910 mW/cm2 at 650 °C in dry methane
was reported [413]. This is shown in Fig. 20, which favorably com-
pares the cell performance running on dry CH4 and H2, with and
without the La2Sn2O7-pyrochlore phase in the Ni-GDC composite
anode. It was reported that the pyrochlore containing anode showed
significantly higher coking resistance even after 20 h of operation
under 0.3 A of constant current. By comparison, x-ray diffraction
analysis of the Ni-GDC anode indicated the presence of carbon under
the same conditions.

As pointed out earlier, MIEC oxides possess the unusual ability
to sustain large nonstoichiometries in their oxygen sublattice without
phase transformations in their crystal structure. Depending on the
MIEC oxide composition, charge compensation to maintain neu-
trality may be accomplished by either electronic transitions such
as changes in the oxidation state of cations and/or by creation of
lattice point defects such as vacancies that are ionic in nature. Ex-
perimental and theoretical studies [63,92,97,98] have already
indicated the importance of surface oxygen for activating the C—H
bond. In this regard, the wide non-stoichiometric window offered
by doped-perovskites can serve as a source and supply lattice oxygen
to the catalytic surface in order to facilitate and enhance C—H bond
activation. To achieve this outcome, a variety of perovskite-based
catalytic anode materials including LaCoO3 [90] La0.08Sr0.92MxO3 − δ
(where M = Mn, Fe, Co) [414] La4Sr8Ti11Mn0.5Ga0.5O37.5 (LSTGM) [384],
and La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3 − δ (LSCM) [415] were employed in order

to oxidize mildly humidified (<3% H2O) methane in SOFCs. The latter
two compositions LSTGM and LSCM were reported to be redox stable
anodes with low polarization losses that rival the performance of
metal-based catalytic anodes, and also showed high catalytic ac-
tivity for full oxidation of methane in SOFCs. The electrode
impedance of LSCM anode was improved upon making a compos-
ite anode by mixing 50–60 wt% LSCM with YSZ, which improved
both adhesion to the underlying YSZ electrolyte membrane as well
as the anode performance for the oxidation of humidified (3% H2O)
methane [416]. However the high activation energy of 160 J/mol for
methane activation suggests that the oxide ion transport is the dom-
inant factor governing the overall rate of the oxidation reaction.
Similarly, various doped-SrTiO3 based [417,418] and La0.7Sr0.3VO3-
based [419,420] perovskite anodes have successfully been employed
for mildly humidified methane oxidation in SOFCs. The vanadate-
based ceria-Pd anodes exhibited considerable conductivity (2 S/cm
at 700 °C), had low electrode polarization resistance (0.4 Ω.cm2 in
CH4 at 600 °C), and gave a substantial power density of 510 mW/
cm2 in humidified CH4 at 800 °C.

Catalytic anodes based on precious metals were also employed
for methane oxidation or transformations in SOFCs [75–77]. Al-
though the number of reports is relatively low, some of the earlier
studies have been reviewed elsewhere [46,209]. Complete conver-
sion of electrochemically pumped oxygen to syngas was achieved
on Pt anodes during partial oxidation of methane at 800 °C in a SOFC
featuring YSZ solid electrolyte [421]. Similarly, Ru-based cermet
anodes have been employed previously for propane oxidation [24,25].
With its significantly higher melting temperature of 2334 °C than
for Pt (1768 °C), Ru offers better microstructural and morphologi-
cal stability. Ruthenium also offers good catalytic activity for the
oxidation reactions of methane and other hydrocarbons. The pas-
sible reaction pathways during methane oxidation on Ru catalytic
anode are illustrated schematically in Fig. 21.

Recent studies have explored Ru as an alternative catalytic anode
material. MEAs with nanoporous Ru [422] and Pd [423] anodes de-
posited on ultra thin film YSZ membranes were fabricated, and
oxidation of humidified CH4 in this micro-SOFC resulted in 450 mW/
cm2 at 500 °C for Ru and 385 mW/cm2 at 550 °C for Pd anodes,
respectively, without any detectable evidence of coking. However,
the OCV in these studies were reported to be much lower than ex-
pected, at around 0.7 V. The total thickness of the MEA was about

180 nm, with 30 nm thick Ru, 80 nm thick YSZ and 70 nm thick Pt
cathode layers. The cross section of the MEA and the plan view of
the Ru anode film are shown in Fig. 22 Interestingly, the micro-
structure of Ru seems to react differently to methane than to
hydrogen fuel, where the granular Ru microstructure is largely pre-
served with increase in the anode sheet resistance upon methane
oxidation, while in the case of hydrogen oxidation the Ru grains seem
to spread and coalesce possibly due to hydrogen-assisted surface

diffusion with corresponding reduction in the Ru sheet resistance.
Although the root cause of this observation has not been identi-
fied yet, its practical implication may relate to the fact that tpb
density during methane oxidation is largely preserved, while it is
apparently reduced in the case of hydrogen oxidation.

Arguably, Ni-based cermets have been the most widely used
anodes not only for the typical fuel hydrogen but also for methane
conversion in SOFCs. Much of the recent progress made in this area
as well as the challenges posed by the fabrication, microstructural
control, catalytic activity, stability and performance of Ni-based anode
materials for conversion of methane and other hydrocarbon fuels
in SOFCs have been reviewed extensively [317]. The review drew
attention to the need for more research for better understanding
of the reaction mechanisms and catalytic activity, and concluded
that oxidation of methane on Ni-based cermet anodes poses sig-
nificant challenges such as coking and sulfur poisoning that lead
to deactivation and cell degradation. These shortcomings unfortu-
nately represent the inherent vulnerabilities of Ni that are difficult
to overcome. The review discussed both engineering solutions that
have been pursued or implemented such as pre-desulfurization and
co-feeding of O2 or steam along with CH4, as well as more funda-
mental solutions that were undertaken such as increasing the basic
site population for the catalytic reaction by adding oxide catalysts
or alkali promoters to Ni, or by alloying the Ni with a less active
metal such as Sn to lower its activity and hence its propensity for
coking. Indeed, Ni—YSZ anodes loaded with 0.5–1.0 wt% Sn showed
dramatically improved stability over Ni/YSZ anode in pure CH4 at
740 °C at 0.6 V constant cell voltage over 5 hours [405]. The results
shown in Fig. 23 indicate how even slight alloying with Sn brings
about a dramatic improvement in the carbon tolerance of the Ni
catalytic anode. The impact of 25 vol.% WC addition on the cata-
lytic behavior and stability of 5 wt% Ni-based ceria cermet anodes
during the oxidation of humidified methane at 850 °C was inves-
tigated using porous YSZ anode structures impregnated with Ni–
WC–ceria mixture [425]. The study reported modest catalytic
behavior but improved coking resistance by WC addition. The stable
operation of the composite anode with the WC phase in humidi-
fied (3% H2O) methane at 850 °C for 48 hours under OCV condition
was also confirmed, although the x-ray diffraction spectra indi-
cated the presence of WO3 in the anode mixture and the cell power
density dropped to more than 1⁄2 of its initial value during the first
few minutes of a 24-h run, after which the power density was prac-
tically unchanged. Moreover, WC is expected to oxidize under oxide
ion flux and may not be a suitable anode material, as is the case
with other metal carbide anodes employed as SOFC anodes at el-
evated temperatures [426].

Another study tested the validity of the hypothesis that in-
creased S/C ratio within the porous anode by coating it with an inert

gas diffusion barrier layer composed of a porous layer of partially
stabilized zirconia and ceria mixture with 1:1 weight ratio may
improve anode stability by impeding the tendency for coking [427].
It was reported that cells with uncoated Ni/cermet anodes can main-
tain stable operation in humidified CH4 for long periods only at
current densities larger than 1.8 A/cm2 at 800 °C, while those with
the diffusion barrier indeed showed stable performance down to
about 0.6 A/cm2, albeit at the expense of overall cell performance
which dropped nearly 20% from 1.0 W/cm2 at 0.7 V without the
barrier layer to 0.8 W/cm2 with the barrier layer.

Attempts to promote the oxidation of dry methane by BaO in-
corporated into the porous Ni/YSZ cermet matrix by microwave
irradiation indicated BaO incorporation into Ni/YSZ anode lowered
carbon accumulation but also exhibited inferior cell performance
and lower kinetic rates at 800 °C [428]. Another study coated a
Ni—MnO reforming catalyst overlayer on top of the Ni/YSZ cermet
anode by in situ reduction of the spinel MnNi2O4, such that upon
reduction the anode microstructure composed of fine-grained Ni
particles imbedded in an MnO matrix [429]. The EIS results in hu-
midified (3% H2O) methane indicated that the anode impedance was
significantly lower for the Ni—MnO/YSZ than for Ni/YSZ anode, which
became even more dramatic at longer times where the imped-
ance under open circuit conditions for the uncoated cell increased
to 20 Ω.cm2 after 6 hours at 800 °C due to carbon deposition, while
the impedance for the Ni—MnO anode went up to less than 2 Ω.cm2,
more than 10-fold improvement in anode performance due to lower
degree of graphitization.

As a more desirable alternative to Ni/YSZ cermets, ceria-based
SOFC anodes have been investigated for methane oxidation for more
than two decades [403,430–432]. Ceria offers important advan-
tages, as it becomes a mixed ionic electronic conductor (MIEC) at
the reducing atmosphere of the anode environment, which extends
the electrochemically active zone beyond the electrode/electrolyte
interface. It can sustain nonstoichiometry in its oxygen sublattice,
and serve as a source for lattice oxygen needed for the electro-
oxidation reaction. It also has a higher ionic conductivity than the
more commonly employed YSZ electrolyte. Exploiting these ad-
vantages, an early study for electrochemical oxidation of methane
successfully employed a 1 mm thick porous LSM cathode-supported
SOFC design with 8 μm thin film YSZ electrolyte, and a Ni/YSZ cermet
anode deposited on top of a 0.5 μm thin yttria-doped ceria (YDC)
catalytic interlayer [432]. The presence of the YDC interlayer helped
lower the anode interfacial resistance by a factor of 6, and no carbon
deposition was observed below 700 °C using slightly humidified

the catalytic role of the lattice oxygen supplied by ceria. Another
study investigated the role of ceria for direct oxidation of methane
in a SOFC configuration at 1000 °C using a gadolinia-doped ceria
(Ce0.6Gd0.4O1.8) anode in connection with catalytically inert Au par-
ticles mixed in a GDC matrix serving as the current collector for the
cell [437]. It was reported that GDC provided an important advan-
tage in suppressing carbon deposition during 350 hours of testing
at 1000 °C. On the other hand, it exhibited only minimal catalytic
activity for steam reforming or methane oxidation. These results
provide strong evidence that the role of Cu in the cermet anode is
not catalytic, but merely to provide electronic conductivity as an
effective current collector. Moreover, the addition of ceria clearly
enhances anode performance in all these Cu-based cermet anode
cells and hence serves an important catalytic role [438], and has
been found to be catalytically more effective than either La2O3 or
MoOx additions to the Cu-based cermet anodes [439]. Neverthe-
less, the catalytic activity of ceria for methane activation is not
sufficiently high for practical interest. Hence, the results highlight
the need to employ an effective catalyst such as Ni, Pt or Ru that
possess the intrinsic ability to break C—H bonds. As Pt and Ru are
expensive catalysts, and Ni poses major problems with carbon de-
position on the anode structure resulting in rapid degradation of
cell performance, ongoing search in this area aims to identify more
suitable anode materials that exhibit catalytic activity comparable
to these known active catalysts but without the limitations posed
by materials costs or carbon deposition.

Catalytic propensity of Ni for pyrolytic carbon formation during
methane oxidation is closely related to its ability to catalyze C—C
bond formation as well as the considerable solubility of carbon in
Ni. Indeed, the ability of Ni to dissolve carbon is exploited indus-
trially to produce man-made diamond particles in the presence of
group VIII metal catalysts using the high pressure, high tempera-
ture synthesis technique developed by General Electric in the 1950s
[440,441]. Indeed, point defects associated with Ni impurities have
been identified in synthetic diamond crystals that are remnants of
Ni incorporation into the diamond structure from the Ni-based cat-
alyst solvent that dissolves the carbon during synthesis [442,443].
An obvious strategy to reduce the tendency for carbon forma-
tion is to lower the thermodynamic activity of Ni by alloying with
another metal such as Sn [405] or Cu [378,444]. In fact, Ni-alloy based
cermets significantly reduced coking on the anode in dry methane,
but did not eliminate it completely. It is interesting to note that the
power densities of the cells that employed Cu—Ni alloy based cermet
anodes for the oxidation of dry methane have improved signifi-
cantly over time at temperatures below 800 °C, and this was ascribed
to better electronic connectivity established at the anode due to
carbon formation [378,444]. An extension of this strategy toward
lowering the thermodynamic activity of Ni in the cermet anode ex-
plored a non-Ni based anode. Indeed, pure Cu-based cermet anodes
were developed and investigated in detail [312–314,380]. Cu offers
several unique advantages. It does not catalyze C—C bond forma-
tion and thus does not promote coking. It is a cheap metal with
excellent electronic conductivity and better stability to oxidation
than Ni. On the other hand, Cu and its oxides have relatively low
melting points (1085 °C, 1232 °C, 1326 °C for Cu, Cu2O, and CuO, re-
spectively), and thus making the cermet fabrication process, which
typically requires sintering of the mixed oxides at high tempera-
tures difficult. The low melting points also lead to grain coarsening,
sintering and microstructural changes in the Cu-based anodes due
to the elevated operating temperatures of SOFCs, which eventual-
ly lead to loss of percolation and electrical connectivity to collect
the electrons released during the oxidation reaction. Fabrication of
Cu-based cermets requires modified process steps such as wet im-
pregnation or infiltration followed by carefully selected temperature
treatment procedures during the preparation of the porous anode
structures [445–447]. More importantly, Cu is a poor catalyst for

(trace H2O) methane that produced a considerable power density
of 370 mW/cm2 at the low operating temperature of 650 °C. This
time using an anode-supported SOFC architecture with Ni/YSZ
cermet anodes, this research group has steadily improved their cell
performance first to about 1 W/cm2 at 800 °C [433], and subse-
quently to 1.27 W/cm2 at 800 °C [434]. The cell was operated under
800 mA/cm2 of constant current at 700 °C for more than 160 h, and
showed no sign of significant coking or cell degradation. Experi-
mental results of cell performance and stability in humidified
methane fuel on Ni/YSZ cermet anodes are shown in Fig. 24. Cata-
lytic activity and coking resistance of Ni/samaria-doped ceria (SDC)
cermet anodes were compared to Ni/YSZ cermet anodes for methane
oxidation [435]. It was suggested that the mixed conducting SDC
might be a more suitable and effective anode support than the purely
ionically conducting YSZ. Although coking resistance of the Ni/
SDC cermet anode was superior to Ni/YSZ, degradation in cell OCV
in methane and considerable carbon deposition on the anode top
surface as well as at the anode/electrolyte interfacial regions were
observed.

The inherent catalytic property of ceria in the cermet anode was
investigated by using catalytically inert metals. One study com-
pared the catalytic behavior of 25 wt% Cu or Au loaded ceria and
SDC composite anodes for the oxidation of H2 and n-butane at 650 °C
[436]. The results indicated that both Cu and Au served as current
collectors and did not participate in the oxidation reaction, while
the addition of ceria to the cermet mix improved the overall cata-
lytic activity of the anode, possibly due to mixed conduction in and

oxidation reactions, so requires the addition of an active catalyst
to the cermet composition in order to achieve reasonable cell per-
formance when methane or hydrogen is employed as the fuel. SOFC
performance of H2 oxidation on Cu/YSZ and Cu/ceria/YSZ cermet
anodes studied at 800 °C were reported to be similar to that of Ni/
YSZ anodes, suggesting that the catalytic activity of the metal
component of the cermet played an insignificant role [379].

Arguably, the first successful attempt to employ Cu-based cermet
anodes with dry methane has validated direct oxidation by gas anal-
yses, which showed CO2 as the primary reaction product with minor
quantities of CO [379]. In methane fuel, the Cu/YSZ cermet anode
performed quite poorly with negligibly small power density and a
low OCV of only 0.5 V vs air at 800 °C, confirming the poor cata-
lytic activity for Cu as well as the YSZ for the oxidation or the
reforming reactions. By contrast, the addition of 0.2 g of ceria per
gram of the Cu/YSZ cermet, which originally contained 40 wt% Ni
or Cu, has greatly improved the catalytic activity and increased the
power density more than 3-fold to 32 mW/cm2 at 800 °C with stable
cell operation for nearly 72 hours [379]. Similarly, the addition of
ceria to the Cu/YSZ composition greatly improved cell perfor-
mance, where the short circuit current densities in CH4 at 800 °C
increased from ~120 mA/cm2 for Cu/YSZ to 480 mA/cm2 for Cu/
ceria/YSZ composite cermet, pointing to the important catalytic role
played by ceria as the primary catalyst for oxidizing methane [26].
The Cu-based cermet anodes provided stable cell operation at con-
stant current in CH4 for 3 days with no deactivation, while the Ni-
based anode deactivated rapidly within 30 minutes in CH4 fuel, where
the reactor tube was completely filled with filamentary carbon de-
posits. Moreover, CH4 conversion was reported to increase linearly
with the current density, indicating that the direct oxidation process
is Faradaic nature.

While the catalytic activities of Cu–YSZ cermet anodes were com-
parable to that of Ni/YSZ anodes for H2 oxidation, Cu/YSZ anodes
were practically inert for the oxidation of dry methane, giving power
densities lower than 10 mW/cm2 at 800 °C. The results suggest again
that Cu serves merely as an efficient current collector to transfer
the electrons from tpb to the external circuit, and not as an effec-
tive catalytic agent for methane activation, while ceria does, although
it should be noted that Cu—Zn is known to be an effective catalyst
for the GWS reaction (5).

In a related study using Cu/ceria/YSZ cermet anodes for the ox-
idation of methane, propane, butane, decane and toluene at 700 °C,
cells that contain less than 20 wt% Cu in the cermet anode struc-
ture showed enhanced cell performance that improved over time,
which was attributed to extended electrical connectivity materi-
alized by the formation of tar-like carbonaceous deposits inside the
pores of the cermet anode that link together the Cu particles [448].
This finding is in agreement with similar reports on improved cell
performance due to carbon deposits during methane oxidation on
Cu-based anodes [378,444].

4.2.3.1. Efficiency for direct oxidation versus steam reforming. To work
around the difficulty in activating the stable C—H bonds, much of
the development work on electrochemical utilization of methane
in SOFCs employed either external or internal steam reforming to
produce a syngas that is then oxidized at the SOFC anode [449]. The
production of syngas, which is a mixture of H2 and CO, is often fol-
lowed by a water gas shift (GWS) process step given by reaction (5)
in order to further increase the H2 content in syngas while con-
verting CO to CO2 by reaction with steam. So in most cases, methane
is converted primarily to H2 for ease of electro-oxidation and to
obtain high cell performance. Naturally, these extra process steps
lead to loss of conversion efficiency as the steam reforming
reaction

is highly endothermic with an enthalpy change of ΔH°298K
= +206 kJ/mol.

Hence, direct electro-oxidation of methane in SOFCs offers ef-
ficiencies inherently higher than for either H2 or CO (see Fig. 3). The
negligibly small entropy change (−1.3 J/K.mol of O2 at 298 K) during
the methane oxidation reaction (1) provides an exceptionally high
ceiling of 100% for the theoretical conversion efficiency. By con-
trast, significantly large entropic losses associated with the H2
oxidation and CO oxidation reactions are correspondingly, −88.48 J/
K.mol of O2 at 298K for H2 and −172.27 J/K.mol of O2 at 298K for
CO, highlighting the thermodynamic losses expected for utilizing
methane reformates.

It is clear from Fig. 3 that the thermodynamic ceiling for the con-
version efficiencies of the syngas components H2 and CO formed
by either external or internal reforming of methane are signifi-
cantly smaller than the 100% theoretical value for direct electro-
oxidation of methane. Such a gap between the efficiencies for
methane versus H2 and CO is an important consideration relevant
to the choices for utilizing methane in SOFCs. Although, H2 has been
the preferred and most frequently used fuel in SOFCs due to its fast
oxidation rate and high power density, and CO is also a competi-
tive and viable SOFC fuel with cell performance comparable to that
of hydrogen, as demonstrated recently in a 1 kW SOFC stack [267],
significantly lower conversion efficiencies for these reforming prod-
ucts provide the required incentives for direct electrochemical
oxidation of methane over reforming processes (see Fig. 3). Con-
version efficiencies of 52–60% LHV reported [57] by SOFC
manufacturer Bloom Energy of California, U.S., for its BloomBox 200–
250 kW power units running on reformed natural gas, is a testament
that there is room at the top for efficiency improvement by re-
search and development for direct electro-oxidation.

5. Major challenges for methane conversion on
catalytic anodes

Among various challenges facing methane conversion in SOFCs,
only two major ones that pertain to methane conversion in SOFCs
are discussed below, as these pose persistent problems and their
solutions will require fundamental advances in materials discov-
ery, and SOFC design and operation. The others, including
microstructural changes or degradation of the electrodes, defect seg-
regation, aging, solid state reactions and interdiffusion among fuel
cell component materials, chemical stability issues, fabrication and
materials costs, current collection and interconnect materials are
common to all SOFC designs regardless of the fuel, and these issues
have been discussed fully in excellent reviews [204,222–230].

5.1. Carbon deposition

One of the major challenges to direct methane conversion in
SOFCs is catalyst deactivation due to carbon deposition, or coking,
on the catalytic anode. This problem has its mechanistic origins in
both thermodynamic and kinetic contributions. The degree of coking
depends on temperature, gas phase composition and the S/C ratio,
and also the nature and catalytic properties of the SOFC anode ma-
terial. The carbon occupies catalytic sites by forming strong bonds
and rapidly deactivates the anode. In extreme cases, it can clog up
the entire reactor and debilitate cell operation.

5.1.1. Thermodynamic considerations

The thermochemistry of the gas phase equilibrium in the C—H—O
system is a useful thinking tool to understand the thermody-
namic driving force for carbon deposition. As evident from the
C—H—O ternary equilibrium diagram [450] of Fig. 25, the compo-
sition of CH4 resides well inside the thermodynamically favorable
region for carbon deposition. This makes it difficult to directly oxidize

ary contours of the carbon deposition region as a function of temperature. Note that
the deposition region expands with decreasing temperature. Carbon deposition
becomes thermodynamically favorable for mixtures whose overall composition falls
inside the deposition region. The dotted blue and green lines denote the loci of the
change in the overall gas compositions for steam and dry reforming processes, re-
spectively. As CH4 is electrochemically oxidized at the SOFC anode, the overall gas
composition follows the trajectory indicated by the thick red dashed arrow. [Adapted

dry methane in SOFCs without coking, and hence the incentive to
employ reforming with steam or CO2 to drive the overall gas com-
position out of the deposition region. The dotted tie lines between
CH4 and H2O and CO2 indicate the overall composition of their cor-
responding gas mixtures during steam and dry reforming processes.
From a purely thermodynamic point of view, the intersection of the
CH4—H2O tie line with the high temperature (T > 800 °C) carbon de-
position boundary indicates that a minimum S/C ratio of 0.5 is
required even at these temperatures to pull the overall composi-
tion out of the deposition boundary. In practice, however, high S/C
ratios >3 are usually employed [358,374]. Nevertheless, moving the
overall composition outside the deposition boundary does not nec-
essarily negate the possibility of coking, which can still happen due
to kinetic reasons. Such is the case for Ni, which is widely used as
an anode catalyst material in SOFCs because of its high catalytic ac-
tivity, good electronic conductivity, low cost, and good thermal and
mechanical properties. It is typically employed in the form of a
porous sintered Ni/YSZ cermet. Unfortunately, Ni readily pro-
motes graphitic carbon deposition at low S/C ratios that leads to
rapid degradation of cell performance. In extreme cases, the porous
anode structure can be clogged up and deactivated by carbon de-
posits if left uncontrolled, e.g., under open circuit conditions. This
is highlighted in Fig. 26, where the cell operating on humidified (3%
H2O) methane at lower temperature and OCV conditions accumu-
lates excessive carbon deposition [376] as shown in Fig. 26 (4), while
the use of high current densities mitigates the effect [451]. The ob-
servations were complemented by a thermodynamic study, where
almost 98% of dry CH4 in the feed gas converts to carbon deposits
under open circuit conditions, as shown in Fig. 27, and the current
density required to remove the deposited carbon is estimated to be
85 mA/cm2 at 750 °C [452].

5.1.2. Spectroscopic observation of carbon formation

SOFC experiments using in situ spectroscopy provide convinc-
ing evidence in support of the results and observations of carbon
deposition under various operating conditions. In situ Raman spec-
troscopy studies on Ni/YSZ cermet anodes on a working MEA
exposed to hydrocarbon fuels have indicated confirmation of carbon
deposition under OVC conditions, which may subsequently be
removed from the Ni surface by the oxygen flux through the YSZ
electrolyte [352,355,356,453]. Fig. 28 illustrates the accumulation
of carbon on a Ni/YSZ cermet anode upon exposure to a single burst
of 5 cm3 of ethylene under OCV, and the disappearance of the graph-
ite G mode peak at 1585 cm−1 with increasing time and cell
polarization. In a similar manner, in situ Raman spectroscopy pro-
vided direct evidence on the efficacy of chemical removal of carbon

from the Ni surface by steam gasification [454]. This is shown in
Fig. 29, which illustrates the removal of surface carbon from Ni en-
tirely by the chemical action of steam without any electrochemistry.
It should be noted that prolonged exposure of Ni to steam-rich en-
vironment eventually oxidizes it to NiO and renders the catalytic
anode inactive. In these circumstances, the persistent problem of
carbon deposition under OCV conditions requires active control.

Naturally, the critical current density needed to completely
remove the deposited carbon by electrochemical oxidation with the
oxygen flux through the electrolyte depends strongly on the con-
ditions selected initially for the fuel mixture and cell operating
parameters. This critical current density is nevertheless a useful
measure to manage and mitigate the coking problem for individ-
ual operational cases. However, this can vary widely depending on
the test conditions. For example, carbon deposition from dry methane
on Ni/YSZ cermet anodes that featured a chemically inert diffu-

sion barrier layer of partially stabilized zirconia and ceria placed
between the anode surface and the fuel compartment required
current densities in access of 1.4 A.cm2 at 800 °C [361] [427]. This
is illustrated in Fig. 30, where cell degradation is clearly obvious even
at 1.0 A/cm2 at 800 °C. In any case, however, high oxide ion fluxes,
or current densities, do not necessarily guarantee complete removal
of carbon deposits from the Ni surface. Only those carbon par-
ticles deposited within the close (several micrometers) proximity
of the tpb may possibly be removed by the O2− flux through the YSZ
electrolyte, but those farther away will rapidly build filamentary
carbon deposits that eventually deactivate the active sites on the
Ni/YSZ cermet anode and clog up the reactor.

A more detailed atomistic level understanding of carbon forma-
tion energetics and mechanisms is facilitated by first principles
calculations, which are discussed in the next section.

5.1.3. Strategies to mitigate carbon deposition

Significant progress toward minimizing coking during methane
conversion in SOFCs was made in the last decade using several strat-
egies. One involved catalytic oxides that offer oxygen storage and
release capacity through their wide tolerance to nonstoichiometry

in their oxygen sublattice. Most are poor catalysts for the promo-
tion of C—C bond formation, and hence help prevent coking. They
also offer opportunities to remove carbon deposits on the catalyst
surface by reaction with lattice oxygen and maintain high cata-
lytic activity. This can happen as spillover of oxygen from the oxide
support material, or directly using a catalytic oxide with signifi-
cant nonstochiometry, such as doped ceria and perovskites. This
strategy has been pursued by many, especially with ceria-based
cermets [23, 449,455]. The electronic conductivity (<10−2 S/cm) of
these oxides and their catalytic activity to promote C—H bond ac-
tivation can be improved by adopting appropriate doping strategies.
For example, ceria doped with rare earth oxides such as Gd2O3 or
Sm2O3 have shown to activate methane oxidation in SOFCs with im-
proved carbon tolerance and cell stability [312,403,456].

The second strategy evolves in part from insights from DFT studies
of methane adsorption and reforming on Ni surfaces, which indi-
cated the Ni(211) edge sites bind carbon strongly and are primarily
responsible for promoting carbon formation [457]. As Ni(211) edge
sites have a lower activation barrier and are more reactive to CHx
species than the close-packed Ni(111) surfaces, the stepwise ab-
straction of hydrogen during the dissociation of methane is
energetically more favorable at Ni(211) sites with the eventual nucle-
ation of graphite. Moreover, the dissociative production of carbon
and hydrogen is endothermic on planar surface, while it is exo-
thermic on the stepped surface, where the exothermicity provides
the driving force for graphite formation. Based on these insights,
the DFT calculations suggested that preferential binding of pro-
moters such as K, S, and Au to the Ni(211) edge sites should reduce
the propensity for coking. Indeed, follow-up experiments that em-
ployed K and S promoters on Ni have shown increased tolerance
to graphite formation by blocking the stepped edge sites, as ob-
served by both kinetic and spectroscopic evidence [458].

Another DFT study compared CH4 dissociation on planar and
stepped Ni and Cu surfaces, where the adsorption energies of surface
CHx species followed similar trends on Ni and Cu as shown in Fig. 31,
which compares the energy profiles of CHx intermediates along the
reaction pathway on Ni and Cu surfaces. This study also indicated
that the exothermicity of the reaction on Ni(211) stepped edges
favors carbon formation, while other surfaces of Cu and Ni do not
[459], which agrees well with the poor catalytic activity but supe-
rior carbon tolerance observed on Cu. Accordingly, it was proposed
that tolerance to carbon can be improved by selective adsorption
of Cu on Ni stepped edges.

The third strategy aiming to reduce coking adopted the use of
Cu in place of Ni [312–314,379,380,438], which has been effective
in preventing carbon deposition, but provided only modest power
densities in most cases. Among these, Cu–ceria cermet anodes seem
to eliminate the coking problem all together. Unlike transition metal
catalysts, Cu does not dissolve carbon and is also a poor catalyst ma-
terial for C—C bond formation, C—H activation, and methane
reforming, and hence, serves merely as a passive electronic con-
ductor in the cermet anode structure.

Another strategy involves chemical engineering of the catalyst
surface. On oxide surface, coking is promoted usually at acid sites,
and doping strategies that lower the population of acid sites on the
oxide surface can mitigate carbon deposition. For example, Ni/La-
doped ceria cermet anode was reported to be significantly more
tolerant to carbon formation than the Ni/ceria cermet anode, while
Ni/Sm-doped ceria cermet displays even better tolerance to coking
than its La-doped counterpart [383]. Likewise, additions of strongly
basic alkali oxide promoters or non-catalytic metals like Au alter
the coking propensity of Ni, respectively, by reducing the popula-
tion of acid surface sites to discourage graphitic carbon formation
[385] or blocking the active step edge sites on the Ni surface [459].
Furthermore, replacing Ni with another catalytically active metal
such as Ru that does not possess sufficient solubility for carbon also

pared to that on planar closed-packed Ni(111) and Cu(111) surfaces, with carbon
as the end points for all cases. However, it is exothermic only on the Ni(211) surface,
while endothermic on others. (Top) Carbon formation is clearly favored by the stepped
Ni(211) surface and not by the planar Ni(111). (Bottom) Dissociation of CH4 on Cu
is highly unfavorable, as each intermediate step requires more energy. The stepped
Cu(211) seems slightly more reactive than the planar Cu(111) surface. These the-
oretical results are in agreement with the poor catalytic activity and lack for coking
observed on Cu. [Reprinted with permission from Ref. 458: Galea NM, Knapp D, Ziegler
T, J. Catal. 2007: 247: 20–33. Copyright (2007) Elsevier.]

improves the carbon tolerance of the anode material [346] without
sacrificing on catalytic activity. A DFT study supplemented by scan-
ning tunneling microscopy (STM) examination of ethylene activation
on Ni(111) surface indicated the pronounced role that step edges
play in promoting C—C bond formation, and demonstrated that
blocking these active edges with Ag favored the selective activa-
tion of the C—H bond without carbon formation [460]. Alternatively,
up to 1.5 wt% sol-gel coating of porous Ni/YSZ cermet anode with
a thin film of samaria-doped ceria (SDC) of the composition
Sm0.2Ce0.8O2 has greatly improved its coking resistance and provid-
ed stable cell operation under OCV conditions at 700 °C in a 25%
CH4 + 75% air mixture as the fuel for nearly 500 hours [461].

Yet another strategy involves the use perovskite-based mixed
proton and oxide ion conducting oxides of the doped-BaZrO3 and
BaCeO3 families as SOFC anodes [462–464]. Proton transport in these
doped oxides starts with the incorporation of OH groups from ad-
sorbed H2O into oxygen vacancies in the perovskite structure
followed by proton transport via the Grotthus mechanism through
the oxygen sublattice [461,465]. Hence, they require sufficient hu-
midity to sustain protonic transport regardless of whether they are
employed as electrolytes or electrode materials in SOFCs. This

the subsequent oxidation of the reformate components. Indepen-
dently, in situ Raman studies of Ni/YSZ cermet anodes infiltrated
by 1% BaO and 1% Sn via an aqueous salt impregnation method
showed resistance to carbon deposition in dry methane under OCV
and fuel cell modes [472]. Sn-doped Ni/YSZ showed inhibition of
carbon deposition around the electrochemically active regions of
the anode, while the undoped Ni/YSZ showed carbon deposition
throughout the anode structure. By contrast, BaO infiltrated anode
greatly inhibited carbon formation throughout the anode struc-
ture, but it also inhibited methane activation giving significantly
lower power densities than the undoped Ni/YSZ cermet anode. The
gasification power of the oxidants to remove the surface carbon was
found to be H2O > CO2 > O2 in effectiveness. However, the Raman
spectra also indicated that the use of O2, and to some degree CO2,
to remove carbon led to the oxidation of the Ni in the anode re-
sulting in degradation of the cell performance.

Despite great progress and creative advances made in anode ma-
terials, it is clear that there is still need for developing catalytically
more superior and non-coking anode materials especially for direct
dry oxidation of methane in SOFCs. While high operating tempera-
tures reduce the thermodynamic compositional boundary for carbon
deposition, catalytic effects and enhanced rates at elevated tem-
peratures still give rise to carbon deposition problems. Lowering the
cell temperature, on the hand, leads to poor cell performance, cre-
ating a dilemma to find the sweet spot in the operating conditions,
and demanding a materials-based solution also. In this regard, cata-
lytic metal oxides and, in particular, MIEC perovskite-based anodes
offer a wide range of doping strategies for tuning and optimizing
materials transport and catalytic properties to effectively activate
C—H bonds for methane oxidation.

Alternatively, one can take advantage of the coking problem
instead and turn it around for beneficial use of generating electric-
ity, albeit with limitations. In this regard, SOFCs are ideally suited
to effectively utilize the deposited carbon and convert it efficient-
ly to electrical energy via internal reforming or direct electrochemical
oxidation [34,36,227,473–475]. Much of the progress made in this
topical area of solid carbon fuel conversion in high temperature fuel
cells has been discussed extensively in recent review articles
[476,407]. It should be noted, however, that this approach has severe
constraints, which limit the electrochemical removal of carbon to
the immediate vicinity of tpb only, and any excessive carbon de-
posited elsewhere in the SOFC cannot be removed electrochemically,
unless invoking a chemical step such as gasification.

5.2. Sulfur poisoning mechanisms and mitigation strategies

Sulfurous species are generally present in all naturally occur-
ring fossil fuels including natural gas, where this is usually in the
form of H2S at quantities that may vary widely from trace amounts
up to 1% depending on the origin of the gas. Even when absent, about
10 ppm of sulfur-containing odorants, such as mercaptans, is typ-
ically added to hydrocarbon gases for ease of leak detection. As
sulfurous species are highly potent poisons or deactivation agents
for catalytic materials, sulfur poisoning of the catalytic anode remains
one of the major hurdles, perhaps Achilles’ heel, that stand in the
way of developing commercial SOFCs that can directly be fueled by
natural gas.

The unusually wide range of fuel flexibility offered by SOFCs
cannot possibly be realized for practical purposes unless the sulfur
poisoning problem is abated and resolved. One strategy is to employ
a priori desulfurization step for the sour gas (i.e., sulfur-containing
natural gas) to remove sulfurous species before reforming or direct
utilization in SOFCs, which of course adds cost and complexity to
the process and reduces overall conversion efficiency. The other strat-
egy is to develop catalytic anodes with sufficient sulfur tolerance.
This is critically important to realize the fuel flexibility and cost

naturally requires active water management that may lower the
overall efficiency. However, their ionic conductivities, shown in
Fig. 32, are more than one order of magnitude higher than YSZ, es-
pecially at T > 500 °C [465]. These materials are mixed ionically
conducting oxides that transport primarily protons at low and mod-
erate temperatures with a gradual transformation into a
predominantly oxide ion transport mode at high temperatures with
the cross-over from one dominant ion transport mode to the other
occurring in a temperature range around 600–800 °C depending on
the perovskite composition and the nature of the dopants [466–468].
A composite anode made of Ni/ BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3 (BZCYYb)/
Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC) achieved a power density of 580 mW/cm2 at
700 °C operated with methane fuel and showed stable operation
for 120 hours [469]. Stable cell operation of the BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3
anode in humidified (3% H2O) methane at 750 °C was also re-
ported, and the post-mortem Raman spectroscopic analysis of the
anode surface confirmed the absence of the 1350 cm−1 and 1580 cm−1
peaks associated with the D and G modes for graphitic carbon [470].
The BZCYYb oxide is combined with catalytic metals such as Pd, Cu,
Ni, and NiCu alloys to make cermet anodes and tested for methane
activation at 750 °C. All cermet compositions were resistant to coking
in humidified (3% H2O) methane. While Pd/BZCYYb and Ni/BZCYYB
anodes showed indications of coking established by Raman spec-
troscopy during 12 hours of operation in dry methane, NiCu/
BZCYYb cermet showed excellent resistance to coking after 24 hours
exposure to dry methane and 130 hours to humidified methane all
under OCV conditions [471]. Modification of the basic Ni/YSZ cermet
structure by BaCO3 addition for in situ formation of a mixed ion con-
ducting BaZr1 − xYxO3 (BYZ) interlayer on YSZ and nano-islands of BaO
on the Ni surface gave promising results for direct oxidation of octane
with substantial power density of 600 mW/cm2 at 750 °C [29]. The
anode showed moderate resistance to coking in humidified (3% H2O)
octane where the current density at 0.7 V dropped initially from 1.1 A/
cm2 to about 0.5 A/cm2 within the first few hours but then held
steady for nearly 90 hours of continuous operation, while in dry
octane coking resulted in rapid cell degradation within the first few
hours. The high catalytic activity for octane was ascribed to the
nanosize BaO/Ni interfaces that promote reforming of octane and

effectiveness of SOFCs, regardless if they are fueled by natural gas,
biogas, coal gas, or syngas without the need for extensive pretreat-
ment and desulfurization.

2− (or, SO3), –SO3

Sulfur can exist in different oxidation and chemical states, and
interacts with most metal and oxide surfaces. For example, a recent
in operando study investigated the interaction of 5 ppm H2S/H2
mixture with the Ni/GDC cermet anode in SOFC by using sulfur
K-edge x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) analysis, and
reported the presence of several surface sulfur species with differ-
ent oxidation states, namely, +6, +4, 0, and −2. Although these
2− (or, SO2),
oxidation states are characteristic of –SO4
molecular S2 or adsorbed S atom, and Ni or Ce sulfides, respective-
ly, the study failed to make definitive identification of the chemical
species associated with the corresponding oxidation states [477].
Poisoning and deactivation of catalysts, especially those based
on nickel, by sulfurous species in the reaction environments is a well
recognized and persistent problem for many industrial catalytic pro-
cesses [478,479], which makes the development of poison-resistant
industrial catalyst a never ending task [480]. This challenge is equally
important for catalytic anodes in the context of direct utilization
and conversion of fossil fuels in SOFCs. Progress in the understand-
ing and development of catalytic anode materials tolerant to sulfur
and other impurities that may be present in real, untreated fuels
has been reviewed elsewhere [481] [482].

5.2.1. Interaction of Ni-based catalytic anodes with sulfurous species
Most of the work related to sulfur poisoning has been con-
ducted in the context of H2 fueled SOFCs, as this has been the most
preferred fuel. So the discussion in this section necessarily draws
upon work performed in H2 fuel environments, but many of the
mechanistic findings and conclusions reported are also applicable
to CH4 fueled SOFCs, albeit with reduction in the reforming activ-
ity on the catalytic anode by the added complications of the
C—H—O—S gas phase equilibrium [483].

Degradation of Ni/YSZ cermet anodes exposed to trace amounts
of H2S in H2 fuel usually manifests itself in two distinct stages
[484,485]. Immediately after exposure to H2S, there is often a pre-
cipitous drop in cell performance followed by a second stage of
degradation behavior that generally shows two types of behavior,
one where the cell power density eventually attains a steady-
state behavior over time, and the other where the cell power
monotonically decreases with time and does not seem to ap-
proach steady-state. This is illustrated schematically in Fig. 33. In
general, the extent of cell degradation due to poisoning increases
with increasing H2S content of the fuel, decreasing overpotential,

decreasing temperature and decreasing current density. Also, the
extent of the performance loss due to sulfur poisoning is consid-
erably higher in anode-supported SOFCs than for electrolyte-
supported SOFCs, where the overall cell impedance in the latter is
significantly higher such that the anode polarization loss contrib-
utes to a smaller fraction of the overall loss mechanisms, while in
anode-supported cells the overall cell resistance is much smaller
so that anode deactivation has a more profound impact on the overall
cell resistance [485]. Sulfur poisoning studies particularly on Ni/
YSZ anodes as well as insights for the development of sulfur-
tolerant anode materials have been discussed extensively in recent
review articles [486,487].

There is reason to believe that sulfur poisoning of SOFC cermet
anodes may involve not just the metal component of the cermet,
but also the ceramic component, which is usually made of the same
electrolyte material used in the cell structure to match thermal
stresses during the cycling of the cell operating temperature. Indeed,
there is experimental evidence [484,488], for example, that Ni/
ScSZ anodes provide better sulfur tolerance than Ni/YSZ cermets,
suggesting that Ni may be a major but not the only contributor to
poisoning. Although better understanding of the mechanistic roots
of sulfur poisoning is still evolving, a recent DFT study [489] of sulfur
adsorption at the tpb of the Ni/XSZ cermet anode, where X denotes
the X+3 dopant cation in the stabilized zirconia electrolyte, provid-
ed some clues to the important role of the electrolyte, and reported
a strong correlation between the adsorption energy of sulfur and
the ionic size of the dopant cation X, such that stabilized zirconia
doped with smaller ionic size dopants (e.g., Sc+3) is indeed ex-
pected to provide better tolerance to sulfur. It was calculated that
the binding energy of sulfur to Ni—YSZ is about 0.1 eV stronger than
it is for Ni—ScSZ. The higher tolerance of Ni—ScSZ is attributed to
the lowering of the ScSZ surface energy and the weakened binding
of sulfur on to this surface.

Sulfurous species interact with the Ni catalyst anode surface in
at least two major ways. One is by dissociative adsorption or
chemisorption on the active sites on the catalyst surface and block-
ing them from participating in further reaction. This process, which
is generally associated with rapid deactivation immediately upon
exposure of the Ni surface to H2S, can be represented by the
reaction,

Thus the reduced active site density naturally reduces the flux
of rate processes at the anode surface, including adsorption,

lowed by two types of 2nd stage behavior: (a) cell power reaches steady-state after initial rapid drop (dotted line), and (b) cell power shows steady and continuous decline
over long periods of time without reaching steady-state (dashed line). [Reprinted with permission from Ref. 486. Cheng Z, Wang JH, Choi YM, Yang Li, Lin MC, Liu M, Energy

dissociation, oxidation and surface diffusion that lead to lower turn-
over frequencies for chemical and electrochemical reactions. The
other interaction mode is by direct chemical reaction between the
catalyst and the sulfurous species to form a new phase or reaction
product with loss in catalytic activity and stability. In addition, other
forms of interactions have also been proposed to account for anode
deactivation and those are discussed further below in the context
of second stage degradation processes.

It is known that the dissociative adsorption of H2S on Ni sur-
faces occurs rapidly and strongly with an enthalpy of adsorption
that decreases rapidly as surface coverage increases (−125 to −165 kJ/
mol for high coverage of 0.5–0.9, and estimated to be −250 kJ/mol
when extrapolated to 0 coverage), such that the surface S—Ni bonds
are over a factor of three times more stable than the bulk Ni—S bonds
at low surface coverage [478]. Similar chemisorption studies on Ni
surfaces using H2 mixtures containing 0.1–30 ppm H2S indicated dis-
sociative adsorption at low surface coverage, and non-dissociative,
i.e., molecular, adsorption at high surface coverage with heat of ad-
sorption values ranging from −125 to −167 kJ/mol at 450 °C at high
surface coverage of 50–90% [490]. Accordingly for the Ni—S system,
the equilibrium is strongly shifted toward a sulfur-covered Ni surface,
i.e., adsorption, instead of the formation of the sulfide phase. More-
over, only 1–10 ppb of H2S concentration in the feed is sufficient
to achieve 50% surface site coverage on Ni at T > 450 °C, which is a
demanding quantity even to identify and control for analytical de-
tection. Almost complete coverage of Ni surface can be achieved with
0.1–1 ppm H2S. These values are well below the concentrations typ-
ically achieved after desulfurization of the feed gas prior to
undergoing catalytic processes. In other words, desulfurization alone
is incapable of total eradication of sulfur poisoning of Ni-based cata-
lysts. By the same token, use of Ni-based anodes for methane
conversion may not be the best option even if natural gas were to
undergo desulfurization. This accentuates the great need for de-
veloping sulfur-tolerant anode materials.

5.2.1.1. Stage I poisoning of Ni-based catalytic anodes with H2S. As
noted in reaction (42), the dissociative adsorption of sulfur on the
Ni surface blocks the active sites and reduces the site density of tpb
that leads to an increase in the anodic polarization resistance. This
mechanism is proposed to account for the sudden loss of cell per-
formance immediately following exposure of the anode to ppm level
of H2S in the fuel feed. Interaction of Ni surfaces with H2S studied
by in situ Raman spectroscopy [491–493] and thermodynamic
analysis [494], as well as DFT calculations [495] independently in-
dicate that under the typical operating conditions of SOFCs and at
H2S concentrations in the low ppm level, bulk sulfides of nickel such
Ni3S2 do not form, instead the Ni surface is covered with adsorbed
sulfur. Therefore, bulk sulfides of Ni are not likely responsible for
the sudden drop in performance. Moreover, the rapid degradation
that may happen within the first minutes after exposure to H2S also
supports the conclusion that surface adsorption is primarily re-
sponsible for the initial rapid cell degradation due to anode
deactivation [496–497]. Additional support for surface sulfur is pro-
vided by other studies that investigated the effect of different
sulfurous species, namely, H2S, COS and CH3SH in humidified (3%
H2O) H2 and CH4 fuels on Ni/YSZ cermet anodes and found the same
deactivation rate at constant current regardless of the type of the
sulfurous contaminant [498]. Upon removal of H2S from the fuel,
the cell performance generally recovers fully or partially under H2
flow from the initial sudden drop, where the extent of recovery
depends on the initial H2S content of the fuel, cell temperature, and
exposure time [484,496,497,499]. The pace of the cell recovery
process seems to improve greatly with increasing temperature as
well as the cell current density [500]. This suggests that lattice oxygen
through the YSZ electrolyte may play a role in oxidizing the ad-
sorbed sulfurous species and cleansing the anode surface.

The critical sulfur content required for the onset of significant
poisoning and deactivation of the catalytic anode shows a strong
temperature dependence, and decreases rapidly with decreasing
temperature. In a systematic study that investigated the impact of
1, 2, 4, 6, 8,10, and 15 ppm H2S addition to a gas mixture of 79%
H2 + 21% H2O, it was reported that for H2S concentrations exceed-
ing 0.05, 0.5, and 2 ppm at 750, 900 and 1000 °C, respectively, a
dramatic increase in the Ni/YSZ anode overvoltage was observed
upon exposure to H2S for 12, 9, and 4 ks at 750, 900 and 1000 °C,
respectively [497]. However, the poisoning effect was reversible and
the cell performance recovered when H2S-free H2 was supplied to
the cell. This study also reported that under open circuit condi-
tions the anode resistance, when exposed to 2 ppm H2S, increased
by 72% and 18 % at 900 and 1000 °C, respectively, while at 750 °C
the increase in the anode resistance was significantly higher (up to
105%) after exposure to only 0.05 ppm H2S. To achieve such ex-
tremely low H2S threshold values in the feed gas is demanding and
costly, but critically important to avoid the onset of sulfur poison-
ing. It also highlights the importance of developing catalytic anodes
that possess sufficient tolerance to sulfur.

In a recent thermodynamic study, quantities of the gas phase
equilibrium species in the C—H—O—S system have been reported
for the case where the initial sulfur content is assumed to be 10 ppm
in one mole of methane [501]. Even with such low H2S content ini-
tially in the fuel, the equilibrium distribution of the gaseous species
shown in Fig. 34 indicate that H2S and COS are the two dominant
species in the gas phase at 800 °C over a wide range of oxygen partial
pressures. The lightly shaded area in Fig. 34 bounded by the verti-
cal dotted lines marks the typical operating regime of SOFCs between
OCV and 0.7 V versus air. This operating regime corresponds to
PO2 ~ 10−20 atm and PO2 ~ 10−15 atm at the anode for OCV and 0.7 V
cell voltage, respectively. H2S and COS are the more stable species
in highly reducing conditions, while SO2 is the more stable gaseous
species under relatively more oxidizing conditions. It is clear that
in the dry methane environment at the anode, the dominant form
of sulfur in the gas phase is H2S, and whose interactions with the
catalyst surface need to be taken into consideration for the devel-
opment of advanced anode materials with sufficient sulfur tolerance.
At intermediate temperatures lower than 650 °C, sulfur-induced
cell degradation becomes irreversible and more pronounced due
to the stronger adsorption of sulfurous species on Ni. At high H2S

The vertical (blue) dotted lines indicate the typical operating voltage regime of the
SOFC, namely, between OCV and 0.7 V vs air. Thermodynamic calculations indicate
that H2S is the dominant species in CH4 environments with COS not far behind.

tously dropped to ~0 mW/cm2 in about 13 minutes upon the addition
of 40 ppm H2S [503].

The prolonged degradation in these cells suggests that the dom-
inant rate process responsible for this behavior most likely proceeds
at a slow rate, although its nature or origin is still unresolved. Several
notable accounts of long-term deactivation have been linked to dis-
parate phenomena including surface reconstruction [496], sulfur–
electrolyte interactions and Ni oxidation [484], tpb site blocking by
the sulfur trapped in oxygen vacancies [504]. Even factors extra-
neous and non-specific to Ni-based anodes have been proposed to
account for the prolonged cell degradation process including im-
purity or defect segregation to the Ni surface, contamination by
impurity cross-over from the glass sealant used in the SOFC, sulfur
poisoning of the cathode [505] by H2S leakage through cracks from
the anode compartment or by the sulfurous impurities present in
the air [485,486]. So the mechanistic nature of the 2nd stage deg-
radation is not understood yet, although one study ruled out the
loss of Ni percolation and microstructural changes in the Ni-
based cermet on the basis of observations that the cell fully recovers
its initial performance upon removal of H2S from the feed gas [499].
Also, ab initio thermodynamic studies of the Ni—S system indi-
cated that regeneration of the Ni surface and removal of sulfur can
be effectively achieved by O2, or preferably H2O, treatment, and
mapped out the temperature and partial pressure regimes for O2,
H2O, H2S, and SO2 to achieve desulfurization of the Ni surface without
oxidizing it to NiO during the process [506].

Sulfur induced reconstruction of the Ni(111) [507] and Ni(100)
[508] surface has been known for a long time. As adsorption in-
volves both electronic and geometric site interactions between the
adsorbate and the surface, the charge redistribution induced by the
strong adsorbate–Ni bond removes charge from Ni—Ni bonds at the
surface. The weakening of the surface Ni bonds gives rise to surface
stresses due to imbalance in the repulsive interactions of the weakly
screened surface Ni. Eventually, this can lead to reconstruction of
the surface. As this involves rearrangement of surface atoms via dif-
fusion, it has been proposed as a possible explanation to account
for the prolonged deactivation behavior of Ni-based anodes [496].
Indeed, the high S/Ni* site ratio observed during desorption ex-
periments was attributed to reconstruction of the Ni surface to a
surface sulfide, consistent with the NiS stoichiometry [490].

DFT calculations of the Ni/YSZ interface predicted that ad-
sorbed sulfur does not favor the stoichiometric Ni/YSZ interface
because of the Coulombic repulsion between the adsorbed sulfur
S−1 species and lattice oxygen O2−, but so long as there happens to
be an oxygen vacancy present at this interface, the adsorbed S−1
readily diffuses over a negligibly small (0.03 eV) barrier toward the
interface and trapped deeply inside the oxygen vacancy with a con-
siderable barrier height of 1.3 eV [504]. Consequently, the sulfur-
trapped oxygen vacancy can no longer participate in oxide ion
transport and hinders the charge transfer process at the tpb, which
leads to reduction in cell performance.

5.2.1.3. Toward Ni-free catalytic anodes for sulfur tolerance. There have
been intensive efforts toward better understanding of sulfur-
tolerance of catalytic anodes, but no viable materials solution or
hypothesis has been developed yet. Although a vast variety of ma-
terials have been investigated for this purpose, a large fraction of
the work reported to date has been focused on Ni-based catalytic
anodes, despite the fact that Ni is known to be susceptible to sulfur
poisoning even at sub ppm level as discussed in detail above. More-
over, methane oxidation over Ni-based anodes often leads to coking
problems too. On the other hand, studies on Ni-free anodes cover
such a broad range of materials that, without a central hypothesis,
it is difficult to judge their catalytic merits and stability in the context
of sulfur-tolerant applications.

concentrations, however, sulfide phases may also form, as pre-
dicted by DFT studies [495]. Caution is suggested, however, in
selecting the characterization tools used for the search or identi-
fication of nickel sulfide phases in Ni-based anodes, where x-ray
diffraction (XRD) analysis of Ni/YSZ anodes exposed to 100 ppm H2S
at 727 °C for 5 days failed to detect the presence of any nickel sulfide
phase, while Raman spectroscopy did [492]. This finding indi-
rectly suggests that the relative amount of the nickel sulfide phase
is too small for XRD, while Raman offers the proper sensitivity to
detect this phase change reaction. Similar studies using Raman spec-
troscopy of Ni/YSZ cermet anode exposed for 5 days at 950 °C to
H2 fuel with 10% H2S content provided further confirmation of the
formation of the nickel sulfide phase [492]. This is illustrated in
Fig. 35, where the formation of bulk Ni3S2 phase and the corre-
sponding Raman spectra are presented [493].

5.2.1.2. Stage II poisoning of Ni-based catalytic anodes with
H2S. Mechanistic underpinnings of the long-term deactivation and
degradation process are yet to be understood. Upon exposure to H2S,
an immediate and precipitous increase in the polarization resis-
tance of Ni-based anodes may soon be followed by either a steady-
state behavior or a monotonic increase over prolonged times that
may or may not approach steady state even after hundreds or thou-
sands of hours (see Fig. 33). There have been various attempts made
to explain and account for the observed degradation behavior under
prolonged operation, albeit without unified agreement among the
studies.

Life time studies on sulfur tolerance of SOFC anodes ran at 1000 °C
in gaseous fuels containing 1000 ppm H2S reported that cell per-
formance quickly attained a steady state behavior soon after the
initial sudden drop upon exposure to H2S, and remained practical-
ly unchanged for the following 800 hours of continuous operation
[502]. Similar results of a swift steady state behavior were re-
ported more recently on Ni/YSZ cermet anodes exposed to 1 and
10 ppm H2S-containing H2 at 750 °C under current carrying condi-
tions for over 3000 hours [485]. In other studies, lifetime test results
showed performance degradation continued in a monotonic manner
up to several thousand hours [488,496]. Long term sulfur stability
in humidified H2 fuel was demonstrated by modifying the Ni/YSZ
cermet anode with ceria nanoparticles infiltrated into the porous
anode cermet structure, where the cell voltage at an applied current
of 400 mA/cm2 dropped from the initial value of 0.78 V to 0.6 V upon
the introduction of 40 ppm H2S but then maintained its stability for
nearly 500 hours of testing time producing 220–240 mW/cm2 of
power at 700 °C, while the power density for the benchmarked cell
featuring the uncoated traditional Ni/YSZ cermet anode precipi-

To improve sulfur tolerance, Ni-containing bimetallic or non-
Ni based cermet anodes as well as oxides have been investigated.
Exploring the impact of metal dispersion and passivation of Ni sur-
faces, one study investigated Ni/YSZ cermet anodes exposed to Sb
and Sn vapors in order to passivate the active surface sites and sup-
press nickel–sulfur interactions [509]. It was estimated that exposure
of the Ni/YSZ cermet anode to 1 ppm Sb vapor resulted in about 2
monolayers (ML), while exposure to 10 ppm Sn vapor gave about
20 ML of surface coverage, discounted for limited solubility of Sb
and Sn in Ni particles. Sulfur stability tests conducted at 0.7 V and
800 °C with H2S concentrations of 1 ppm and 5 ppm added to hu-
midified H2 fuel, respectively, indicated significant improvement in
tolerance for both Sb and Sn passivated Ni compared to benchmarked
Ni/YSZ anode, especially with Sn, where no change in cell perfor-
mance was observed in 1 ppm H2S for nearly 90 hours. However,
higher surface coverage of Sb and Sn reduced the catalytic activity
and cell performance even in pure H2 possibly by blocking the active
sites. Also the performance drop upon exposure to 1 ppm H2S
became irreversible. Although about 1 ML of surface passivation with
Sb or Sn seems to eliminate the catastrophic effect of sulfur poi-
soning of Ni in 1 ppm H2S, it should be noted that at high cell
polarization, i.e., high current densities, it is very likely that both
Sb and Sn are oxidized, and their oxides may offer better sulfur tol-
erance albeit at the expense of significant reduction in cell
performance due to their blocking effect.

Many transition metals were considered as viable alternatives
to Ni from the catalytic point of view, but most of them share similar
affinity for sulfur and carbon, and hence, susceptibility for deacti-
vation by both species. Accordingly, decreasing the activity of Ni by
alloying with a non-coking metal such as Cu was proposed to mit-
igate deactivation of the catalytic cermet [378], which eventually
lead to full replacement of the Ni/YSZ cermet anode with Cu/YSZ
[380,510] and Cu/ceria [312,314,511] cermets. The advantages of
Cu are that it is an inexpensive metal with excellent electrical con-
ductivity, and unlike Ni, does not promote carbon deposition. Also,
its sulfides are less stable than the sulfides of Ni. Indeed, Cu/CeO2/
YSZ composite cermet anodes exposed to increasing H2S levels up
to 450 ppm in humidified H2 fuel (10% H2O + 90% H2) indicated stable
cell performance at 800 °C over several hundred hours, while con-
centrations above 900 ppm H2S resulted in catastrophic cell
degradation, which is attributed to the reaction of ceria with H2S
to form the Ce2O2S phase at these high concentrations [512].

Many different families of metal oxides with sufficient trans-
port and catalytic properties are being explored as candidates for
Ni-free anode structures. The sulfur tolerance of the pyrochlore struc-
ture Gd2Ti2O7 doped with molybdenum to form the mixed ionic
electronic conducting (MIEC) anode composition Gd2Ti1.4Mo0.6O7 was
tested for stability in 10% H2S + 90% H2 mixture at 0.7 V constant
cell voltage and at 950 °C for 114 hours, and showed no observ-
able degradation in cell performance as well as no new phase
formation other than the pyrochlore Gd2Ti1.4Mo0.6O7 as deter-
mined by x-ray diffraction [513]. The modified pyrochlore
Gd2Ti1.4Mo0.6O7 anode also had considerably high catalytic activity
and produced a peak power density of 342 mW/cm2 at 950 °C in
10% H2S + 90% H2 mixture.

Perovskite-based MIEC/electrolyte composite anode structures
were also investigated for sulfur tolerant anodes. A porous ceramic
composite of yttrium-doped SrTiO3 (YST) and YSZ was impreg-
nated with Ru nanoparticles and CeO2 displayed a high tolerance
up to 40 ppm H2S containing H2 fuel, and high catalytic activity with
a decent performance of 470 mW/cm2 in 10 ppm H2S containing H2
at 800 °C. Addition of 10 ppm H2S at a current density of 0.5 A/
cm2 dropped the cell voltage only slightly from 0.79 V to 0.78 upon
exposure to H2S [514]. Stability studies of La0.75Sr0.25Cr1 − xMnxO3
(LSCM) for x = 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 conducted in 10% H2S-containing hu-
midified H2 at 950 °C for 5 days, indicated the formation of new

phases such as MnS, La2O2S and MnOS, suggesting that this cata-
lytically active anode material does not possess sufficient stability
against high concentrations of sulfur [321]. Nevertheless, these
results suggest the possibility of employing MIEC-based catalytic
anode compositions for sulfur tolerance in moderately low sulfur
content fuels.

A significant deviation from the MIEC perovskites that conduct
oxide ion and electron hole species concurrently is a new class of
potential anode materials based on the mixed ionically (i.e., oxide
ions and protons) conducting perovskites of the doped-BaZrO3 and
BaCeO3 families and their solid solutions that were proposed for miti-
gating coking and sulfur tolerance in SOFCs [462]. Using yttrium and
ytterbium co-doped compositions BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3 − δ (BZCYYb)
and BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3 − δ (BZCY), cells featuring Ni/BZCYYb cermet
anodes showed higher and more stable OCV and performance in
humidified H2 than Ni/BZCY, possibly due to the cooperative effect
of these B-site cations to improve both ionic conductivity as well
as catalytic activity. Indeed, cells with Ni/BZCYYb anodes achieved
impressively high peak power densities of 1.13, 0.63, and 0.53 W/
cm2 at 750, 650, and 600 °C, respectively, in humidified hydrogen
[463,515]. When 20 ppm H2S was added to wet hydrogen, the cell
performance remained practically unchanged with peak power den-
sities of ~1.1 and ~0.66 W/cm2 at 750 and 650 °C, respectively [462].
The stability of the Ni–BZCYYb anode, especially with the SDC elec-
trolyte under 700 mA/cm2 of constant current at 750 °C in humidified
H2 containing up to 50 ppm H2S, was exceptional even after more
than 50 hours of operation. It was suggested that the dissociatively
adsorbed water near tpb on the BZCYYb surface facilitates the ox-
idation of H2S or sulfur to SO2, which desorbs readily. The
performance of the cells with Ni/BZCYYb anode and either BZCYYb
or SDC electrolytes in dry propane and humidified H2 with and
without 20 ppm H2S is shown in Fig. 36. The cell with Ni–BZCYYb
anode on BZCYYb electrolyte showed the onset of only minimal deg-
radation for H2S contents 30 ppm or higher. These values are in
general agreement with theoretical predictions by DFT of phase equi-
librium studies between the Y-doped Ba(Zr,Ce)O3 phase and sulfurous
environments containing up to 100 ppm H2S between 600 and
850 °C, where only the Zr-containing composition BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3 − δ
is shown to provide sufficient tolerance to sulfur up to about 60 ppm

trolytes at 750 °C operating in dry propane and in humidified H2 with and without

at 750 °C, while the BaCeO3 and BaCe0.8Y0.2O3 − d phases both de-
compose into BaS and individual oxides even at few ppm of H2S
[486]. The Ni/BZCYYb was also found to be stable against coking
when operated in dry propane, and mass spectrometry of the ef-
fluent gas stream confirmed the production of C2H4, CH4, H2, H2O,
CO2 and CO species, indicating that this anode composition also pos-
sessed good catalytic activity for both the reforming and oxidation
reactions of C3H8. Unfortunately, no sulfur studies in connection with
hydrocarbon oxidation were conducted by the authors on these cata-
lytically active anodes, but their high cell performance in conjunction
with high sulfur tolerance up to 20 ppm H2S as well as their chem-
ical and structural stability against electrochemical cycling for nearly
1000 cycles with no appreciable change [462] makes them quite
attractive for further work toward the development of highly tol-
erant catalytic anodes for sour fuel utilization in SOFCs.

5.2.2. Metal sulfide-based anodes

Some metal sulfides, such as MoS2, are well known as effective
dehydrosulfurization catalysts and have been employed commer-
cially in industrial processes. Accordingly, sulfur and chemical
stability as well as catalytic activity of metal sulfide-based mate-
rials and others were investigated for SOFC applications. An extensive
study using both experimental techniques and thermodynamic anal-
yses screened a large class of materials including metal carbides,
borides, nitrides, sulfides, silicides and perovskite-type oxides, and
analyzed their stability against hydrolysis, carbonation, and
sulfidation or decomposition in H2S, CO2 and H2O environments, as
well as possible interactions and reactions of these materials with
other cell components under the conditions relevant to SOFC op-
eration [494]. Due to their chemical instability under SOFC conditions
in these environments, the study ruled out most of the metal car-
bides, nitrides, borides and silicides as potential candidates for sulfur
tolerant anodes. The thermodynamic analyses predicted that SrTiO3
would be stable against 10%H2S at 950 °C, while LaTiO3 and SrVO3,
and most likely LaVO3 too, are all prone to sulfidation reactions, and
hence, do not exhibit sufficient tolerance to sulfur. It also pre-
dicted that most transition metal sulfides would not be suitable
candidate anodes if the fuel contains only ppm level of H2S, as most
would decompose to their metals under these low sulfur activi-
ties and may not be suitable for SOFC applications. However, at
sufficiently high H2S levels exceeding 1000 ppm or more, some of
the sulfides such as WS2 or MoS2 may have sufficient stability. For
example, the thermochemical equilibrium sulfur activity for WS2
at 1000 K corresponds to 9.4 × 10−4 or ~1000 ppm H2S.

On the other hand, the stability of these metal sulfides in high
sulfur activities was exploited for removal of H2S from highly con-
centrated streams or for the electrochemical oxidation of H2S for
power generation purposes. Indeed, electrochemical removal of H2S
from hot coal gas streams using a NixS-based cathode [516], as well
as its electrochemical oxidation on CuFeS4 catalytic anode [517] in
SOFCs has been proposed several decades ago. Experimental results
for electrochemical utilization of H2S on Pt in SOFCs at H2S levels
of 1–25% (balance nitrogen) and SOFC operating temperatures of
600–850 °C indicated that the favored reaction pathway was the
complete oxidation of H2S to SO2 and H2O [518], while another study
using 0.37% H2S (balance He) in a Pt/YSZ/Pt cell demonstrated the
NEMCA effect for the decomposition of H2S to H2 and S2 at 600–
750 °C with a rate enhancement factor of 11 achieved at 600 °C
beyond the Faradaic rate [519]. The underlying reason for the sta-
bility of the Pt electrodes in these H2S environments was revealed
by a study that used H2S as fuel in a Pt/YSZ/Pt cell for co-generation
of SO2 and electrical power between 650 and 800 °C [520]. It was
reported that the stability and product selectivity of the Pt anode
was dependent on the ratio between the O2− ion flux through the
YSZ and the rate of arrival of H2S on to the Pt surface. Poor selec-
tivity for SO2 was observed when this ratio is less than 0.33, where

elemental sulfur is the major reaction product, and the Pt anode
has undergone significant sintering and its surface severely deac-
tivated. For higher ratios, there was complete selectivity for the
production of SO2, and as high as 99% H2S conversion was achieved.
Several metal sulfides, namely, CoS1.035, WS2, and Li2S/CoS1.035, were
investigated as possible anode materials for the oxidation of 25%
H2S (balance inert) in SOFCs, where a remarkably high power density
of 412 mW/cm2 at a cell voltage of 0.317 V and up to 75% conver-
sion of H2S was achieved with the Li2S/CoS1.035 composite anode at
770 °C [521]. The cell performance of the cell with the WS2 anode
was considerably lower, and gave a low power density of 16 mW/
cm2 for 25% H2S at 820 °C.

MoS2 is an inexpensive and active catalyst tolerant to sulfur, but
it also tends to sublime above 450 °C at atmospheric pressure, which
limits its use in the high operating temperature regime of SOFCs.
To overcome this drawback, bimetallic sulfides of M—MoS2 (M = Fe,
Co, Ni) were investigated as sulfur tolerant anode candidates in pure
H2S/air SOFCs between 650 and 830 °C [522]. Although the com-
posite metal sulfide anode structures practically eliminated
volatilization losses of MoS2, the performance of the cells were
modest at best but still comparatively better than for the
benchmarked Pt catalyst, which was severely deactivated by the 100%
H2S fuel. IR-compensated maximum power density of 115 mW/
cm2 was achieved with the cell employing Co—Mo—S composite
anode at 850 °C. The sulfur and performance stability of this cell
was greatly improved by adding Ag power to the Co—Mo—S com-
position, and stable operation without any degradation was achieved
in pure H2S at 450 mA/cm2 constant current density at 850 °C for
over 6 days of continuous testing [522].

5.2.3. Sulfur tolerance in CH4 environments

Much of the preceding discussion on sulfur poisoning is related
mostly to H2S containing H2 fuel environments at the catalytically
active Ni-based SOFC anodes. As indicated in the equilibrium gas
phase composition of Fig. 34, inclusion of the carbon chemistry to
hydrogen, as is the case for methane, introduces new sulfurous
species, especially COS, which also interact with the anode surface,
and hence must be accounted for in the development toward sulfur-
tolerant catalytic anode materials.

Accordingly, anode deactivation processes during methane ox-
idation are more complicated than for the case of H2S-contaminated
H2 oxidation. Aside from the interactions of sulfur with the anode
surface, oxidation of sulfur-containing hydrocarbons proceed some-
what differently from H2 due to the prevalence of reformation and
water gas shift reactions taking place concurrently, and being af-
fected by sulfur and potentially by carbon deposition also.

5.2.3.1. Sulfur-poisoning of Ni-based anodes in CH4 environment. As
an excellent reforming catalyst, Ni has been employed in many SOFC
studies for hydrocarbon conversion. An EIS study of the Ni/ScYSZ
cermet anode (zirconia co-doped with 10 mol% Sc2O3 and 1 mol%
Y2O3) in dry CH4 fuel containing 0–100 ppm H2S at 850 °C and under
various current densities ranging from 0 to 1 A/cm2 indicated several
interesting results [523]. EIS results indicated that the presence of
H2S affected two major processes, namely, the chemical kinetics of
the internal reforming reaction and the electrochemical charge trans-
fer reaction at the tpb. Contrary to the behavior in H2 fuel, increasing
the current density for the CH4-fueled cell did not seem to miti-
gate the poisoning effect of the electrochemical charge transfer
reaction. However, the poisoning effect was found to be reversible
upon removal of H2S from the methane fuel, but the initial loss in
performance was higher at higher current densities, which is in con-
trast to some of the earlier studies that reported the drop in the
anode polarization resistance due to poisoning in H2S-containing
H2 fuel was smaller at high current densities [500]. A study com-
paring the behavior of Ni/YSZ and Ni/ScYSZ cermet anodes reported

42

T.M. Gür/Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 54 (2016) 1–64

that the latter anode composition greatly improved the sulfur tol-
erance of CH4-containing fuels with sulfur contents of 10–20 ppm
H2S over hundreds of hours, yet the cell behavior indicated both
anodes suffered severe poisoning even at 2 ppm H2S that greatly
reduced the reforming activity and degraded cell operation [488].
In a separate study using Ni/YSZ anodes, nearly 60% of the methane
reforming activity was lost after introducing 4 ppm of H2S at OCV,
but at 1 A/cm2 of current density a reasonably stable cell opera-
tion was possible below 7–9 ppm H2S [483]. Also, the impact of sulfur
poisoning on the charge transfer reaction at the tpb was signifi-
cantly more pronounced than for internal reforming. This finding
is supported by theoretical predictions of increased charge trans-
fer resistance due to sulfur trapping in oxygen vacancies at the Ni/
YSZ tpb, blocking the pathway for oxide ion transfer [504]. Similar
studies on direct internal reforming of methane on Ni/YSZ at 750 °C
indicated that addition of 1 ppm H2S significantly degrades both the
reforming activity and cell voltage, while the extent of degrada-
tion was found to be only partially reversible due to residual
adsorbed sulfur detected by depth profiling on the surface of Ni par-
ticles down to ~40 nm below surface [524]. Addition of 2 ppm H2S
into simulated coal-syngas containing methane was also reported
to inhibit the reforming activity of the Ni/YSZ anode at 750 °C [525].
Doubly doped ceria-based cermet anodes of the composition Ni/
Ce0.8Y0.1Yb0.1O1.9 were reported to show resistance to coking as well
as display excellent sulfur tolerance to 5 ppm H2S-containing dry
CH4 at 750 °C for 120 hours of stable cell operation at a current
density of 200 mA/cm2 [526]. The cooperative effects of the two rare
earth cation dopants combined with the catalytic activity of ceria
were proposed to account for the enhanced tolerance and stable cell
operation.

Nevertheless, the rapid deactivation due to strong binding of
sulfur to Ni even at sub-ppm concentrations makes it very diffi-
cult to effectively employ Ni as the catalytic anode for CH4 oxidation
in the presence of sulfur-containing contaminants, as is the case for
natural gas. In recognition, there is major interest in the SOFC com-
munity to develop catalytically active sulfur-tolerant anodes for
natural gas conversion.

5.2.3.2. Sulfur-tolerance on transition metal-based anodes in CH4
environment. Cu/ceria-based cermet anodes were developed and
investigated for direct oxidation of dry hydrocarbons in sulfurous
environments. A comparative study of coking and sulfur tolerance
properties as well as cell performance at 800 °C between the Cu/
YSZ cermet anode and Cu/CeO2/YSZ composite cermet anode
reported better cell performance for the composite cermet than with
Cu/YSZ in both H2 and dry CH4 fuels resulting in full oxidation of
methane to CO2 as confirmed by current measurements and product
gas analysis [527]. Although Cu exhibited no catalytic contribu-
tion, the addition of ceria to the cermet greatly improved cell
performance and indicated that ceria is a good oxidation catalyst
transferring the lattice oxygen to the tpb site for the oxidation re-
action. Interestingly, however, the sulfur tolerance of the Cu/YSZ was
significantly better than the ceria-containing cermet, where cells
operating in n-decane fuel containing 5000 ppm sulfur in the form
of thiophene operated without degradation for 24 hours, while Cu/
ceria/YSZ anode showed severe deactivation when exposed to
5000 ppm sulfur due to the formation of the Ce2O2S phase [512].
Sulfur tolerance of Cu is possibly due to the fact that Cu does not
play a significant role in catalyzing the methane oxidation reac-
tion and so its surface sulfur does not affect its catalytic behavior.
Moreover, sulfides of copper are less stable than nickel sulfides. This
presents a challenging choice between the catalytically active ceria-
based cermets prone to sulfur deactivation versus sulfur tolerant
but catalytically inactive YSZ-based cermets. Many of the salient elec-
trical and catalytic properties of Cu-based cermet anodes for methane

oxidation, their fabrication processes and microstructural features
are discussed in detail elsewhere [312,314,380].

Other transition metal or alloy cermet compositions such as
Fe—Ni alloy/ScSZ cermet [528] and Fe/YSZ cermet [373] anodes have
been investigated for oxidation of hydrocarbon fuels in SOFCs, but
with the expected outcome of carbon deposition, while sulfur tol-
erance of these anodes was not examined. A density functional
theory (DFT) study investigated M/Ni alloys (M = Bi, Mo, Fe, Co, Cu)
for methane activity, and sulfur and carbon tolerance and the results
indicated that surface carbon and sulfur can be inhibited by surface
alloying of Ni with Mo while preserving the catalytic activity, but
the best catalytic activity was obtained with Cu/Ni, Fe/Ni, and Co/
Ni alloys [529].

Aside from perovskite-type oxides, other structures were also
explored. A more notable and promising development is the cermet
anode matrix of the composition Pr0.8Sr1.2(Co,Fe)0.8Nb0.2O4 + δ having
the K2NiF4-type crystal structure and containing dispersed Co—Fe
alloy nanoparticles. This material was investigated for methane ox-
idation activity and sulfur resistance in a SOFC, and the composite
anode containing the Co—Fe alloy nanoparticles showed excellent
catalytic activity of 960 mW/cm2 of power density in H2 at 850 °C
and 860 and 920 mW/cm2 of power density when exposed to 50
and 100 ppm H2S-containing H2 fuel, respectively, at the same tem-
perature and showing stable operation for nearly 100 hours under
constant current conditions of 600 mA/cm2 at 800 °C in 50 ppm H2S
containing H2 [530]. Moreover, this redox stable composite anode
also performed well in CH4 and C3H8 fuels giving power densities
of 600 mW/cm2 and 940 mW/cm2, respectively, at 850 °C with no
indication of coking. The presence of the Co—Fe alloy was as-
cribed to the high performance of this anode material that compares
well with Ni-based cermets, but with better tolerance to coking and
sulfur poisoning.

5.2.3.3. Sulfur-tolerance studies on oxide anodes
in CH4
environment. Much of the attention toward the development of
sulfur-tolerant anodes is focused on doped perovskites. A redox stable
perovskite composition La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3 − δ (LSCM) was pro-
posed as a potential anode material for oxidation of H2 as well as
for complete oxidation of CH4 to CO2 [181,197,531–533] with cata-
lytic activity comparable to Ni/YSZ without the carbon deposition
problem, but found to display low activity for CH4 reforming either
with H2O or CO2 [415]. This composition undergoes a phase trans-
formation from hexagonal structure in air to orthorhombic in H2,
which is accompanied by a negligible (~1%) volume change. Ac-
cordingly, its conductivity increases about an order of magnitude
in the 10% H2S containing H2 environments [321]. Exposed to 10%
H2S-containing humidified H2, the SOFC exhibits the typical cata-
strophic deactivation behavior due to sulfur poisoning of this anode
material, where the current density at 0.7 V dropped from about
220 mA/cm2 to 120 mA/cm2 within 1 hour. Also, the formation of
secondary impurity phases such as the electronically conducting MnS
and α-MnOS and the insulating La2O2S were detected by x-ray dif-
fraction analysis upon exposure for 5 days at 950 °C [321] or even
after 2 hours of exposure to 5% H2S containing H2 at 800 °C [194].
These results suggest that the LSCM anode composition may not
possess sufficient sulfur tolerance and stability at such high H2S con-
centrations as originally proposed. Moreover, catalytic studies of
methane oxidation over LSCM in pulse reactors, although re-
ported 100% total oxidation at high oxygen stoichiometries, also
observed insufficient catalytic activity short of what may be desir-
able for practical applications [181]. MgO-promoted chromite-
based oxides with the general formula LaCr0.5 − xMnxMg0.5O3.yMgO
(x = 0, 0.25, and y = 0, 17) were investigated in a fixed bed reactor
for catalytic combustion of methane in 200 ppm SO2-containing 2%
CH4 + 18% O2 (balance He) reaction mixture at 800 °C, and indi-
cated several interesting results, namely, the presence of MgO

improves catalytic activity and sulfur tolerance by providing pref-
erential adsorption sites for SO2, while the catalytic activity scales
with the Cr content in the structure [534]. The study suggested
LaCr0.5Mg0.5O3 representing the optimal composition for reason-
able catalytic activity as well as sufficient sulfur tolerance.

Sulfur tolerance studies for the La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-δ/Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9
composite anode structure were conducted in 0.2% and 0.5% H2S
containing humidified CH4 between 750 and 900 °C under anodic
polarization conditions [535]. Stability tests in humidified 0.5%
H2S + 99.5% CH4 mixture at 850 °C under a constant anodic poten-
tial of −0.5 V indicated the typical initial drop in current density from
0.233 A/cm2 to 0.2 A/cm2 in the first 10 hours representing a deg-
radation rate of 1.4%/h was followed by the 2nd stage slow decline
at a rate of 0.017%/h for the next 110 hours of operation. Electron
microscopic and energy dispersive x-ray analysis of the anode in-
dicated the absence of carbon or sulfur, and the 2nd stage slow
degradation was ascribed to coarsening effects in the anode mi-
crostructure. With such limited sulfur tolerance and moderate cell
performance for methane oxidation, the practical prospects for the
LSCM catalytic anodes remain questionable.

Sulfur poisoning and catalytic activity for methane combus-
tion of the Ce-doped lanthanum manganite cobaltite of the
composition La1 − xCexMn1 − yCoyO3 was investigated in 20 ppm SO2-
containing 1% CH4 in air at 700 °C and full combustion of CH4 to CO2
was reported for all compositions of x and y. However, all compo-
sitions also displayed poor tolerance to sulfur due to the formation
of sulfate groups around the surface La3+ ions forming La2(SO4)3 [536].
Alternatively, the vanadate-family of doped perovskites is also
investigated as potential candidates for sulfur-tolerant SOFC anodes.
LaxSr1 − xVO3 − δ (LSV) was reported to be stable over the range of
oxygen partial pressures from 10−14 to 10−20 atm, with high n-type
electronic conductivity up to 120 S/cm measured at 800 °C and
oxygen pressure of 10−20 atm for the composition La0.7Sr0.3VO3-δ, but
did not seem to possess sufficient redox stability due to the irre-
versible formation of Sr3V2O8 phase in oxidizing conditions with poor
electrical conductivity [537]. Another study reported much higher
electrical conductivities of 800 S/cm for La0.3Sr0.7VO3 − δ in humidi-
fied H2 and 149 S/cm for La0.7Sr0.3VO3 − δ at 800 °C, and found
LaxSr1 − xVO3 − δ is stable in reducing (4% H2 + 96% Ar) atmosphere as
well as when exposed to high H2S content (10% H2S + 3% H2O + 87%
H2) mixture at 950 °C for 5 days for the stoichiometries x = 0.3, 0.5,
07, where no changes in the x-ray diffraction patterns were ob-
served [538]. Despite decent electrochemical activity, however, the
x-ray diffraction results also indicated large volume changes during
re-oxidation of LSV that makes it difficult to employ LSV as the lone
anode material. The La0.7Sr0.3VO3 − δ composition was tested for sta-
bility and performance in 5% H2S (balance N2) and 5% H2S (balance
H2) mixtures at 1000 °C, and showed modest cell performance of
90 mW/cm2 and 135 mW/cm2, respectively, as well as good stabil-
ity against 5% H2S with no significant deterioration over 48 hours
[539]. Based on these encouraging results, LSV anodes with the
nominal composition La0.7Sr0.3VO3 − δ were tested for sulfur toler-
ance in 5% H2S + 95% CH4 mixture at 950 °C with decent power
density of 280 mW/cm2, and stable cell performance for 4 hours
before cell degradation commenced [540]. Interestingly and unex-
pectedly, the same anode composition run in pure H2 gave nearly
a factor of 2 less performance of only 155 mW/cm2 at the same tem-
perature, and the higher performance of the LSV anode in the 5%
H2S + 95% CH4 fuel mixture was attributed to the formation of a cata-
lytically active surface sulfide at these high H2S concentrations.
Moreover, the cell degradation after 4 hours was ascribed to slow
delamination of the anode layer from the YSZ electrolyte, and not
to sulfur poisoning.

La0.7Sr0.3VO3 − δ catalyst infiltrated into porous YSZ to make a LSV/
YSZ composite anode with ~10% LSV loading did not possess
sufficient activity but the addition of Pd catalyst and CeO2 to the

anode improved the cell performance at 700 °C from 90 mW/cm2
to 470 mW/cm2 in humidified H2 fuel, while cell performance at
800 °C was 960 mW/cm2 in H2 fuel and 510 mW/cm2 in CH4 [419].
However, the composite anode with Pd/CeO2 active catalyst and LSV/
YSZ, when heated in air, indicated strong degradation in the cell
performance that decreased to 280 mW/cm2 at 700 °C in humidi-
fied H2 fuel suggesting an adverse interaction of the active catalyst
with LSV. Despite their tolerance to sulfur, their poor fuel cell per-
formance in the absence of an active catalyst does not qualify LSV-
based anodes as promising candidates for methane oxidation due
to their inherently insufficient catalytic activity.

Rare earth metal doped-SrTiO3 perovskites are investigated for
potential sulfur tolerant catalytic anodes for SOFCs that utilize sulfur-
containing fuels. An all-ceramic composite anode made by mixing
a 50:50 mass ratio of La0.4Sr0.6TiO3 (LST) with YSZ indicated high cata-
lytic activity, high stability, and excellent sulfur tolerance when tested
at 850 °C in CH4 containing up to 20% H2S, where the power density
was measured to be 450 mW/cm2 compared to the case in pure CH4,
which only yielded 2 mW/cm2 on the same composite anode [541].
This intriguing result of such dramatic improvement of more than
2 orders of magnitude in cell performance from 2 to 450 mW/cm2
merely by the addition of 20% H2S into methane was attributed to
the strong promoting effect of H2S in CH4 activation, where the for-
mation of the surface intermediate methyl thiolate (CH3SH) was
proposed to participate in the oxidation reaction to form CS2, which
was confirmed by gas analysis. XPS analysis of the anode surface
indicated the presence of elemental sulfur, but no trace of metal
sulfides. Furthermore, x-ray diffraction analysis indicated no new
phases after this 50:50 composite anode was exposed to 5000 ppm
H2S at 1200 °C for 1 week, confirming its superior chemical and sulfur
stability in high sulfur environments. A slightly modified compo-
sition La0.4Sr0.5Ba0.1TiO3 (LSBT) of the catalytically active LST was
impregnated into porous YSZ to make a composite anode, where
the presence of 5000 ppm H2S in CH4 made it more difficult to
remove carbon deposits [542], but the cell performance in dry CH4
containing 5000 ppm H2S was again significantly higher than in pure
CH4, with similar trends for H2—H2S mixtures, at temperatures 800–
900 °C [543,544]. As in the case of LST/YSZ and LSBT/YSZ composite
anodes, it is interesting to note that the YSZ/YST composite anodes
made by impregnating porous YSZ with Sr0.86Y0.08TiO3 also indi-
cated dramatic improvement in cell performance by a factor of 35
when 5000 ppm H2S was added to humidified CH4 fuel, such that
the maximum power densities obtained with and without H2S ad-
dition to CH4 were, respectively, 37 and 1.1 mW/cm2 at 850 °C [545].
The origin of this enhancement is not understood. It is suspected
that the adsorption of H2S on oxygen vacancies may lead to sulfur
groups on the surface that may be playing a critical role in activa-
tion of the catalyst for methane oxidation.

6. Opportunities and outlook for methane conversion
in SOFCs

Largely driven by the focus of federal research programs in hy-
drogen, most of the prior work on SOFCs has been based on the use
of H2 as the preferred fuel, although hydrogen, unlike natural gas,
is not a naturally occurring energy source. With the distribution in-
frastructure already in place, natural gas conversion to electrical
power in SOFCs is a promising direction, but it poses major tech-
nical difficulties also. Natural gas typically contains 85–95 vol% CH4
with the remaining made up by CO2, N2, other hydrocarbons and
sulfurous contaminants. The presence of sulfur and its detrimen-
tal impact on anode activity has been one of the big impediments
to effectively use natural gas in SOFCs without major pretreat-
ment. Additional demands are placed on the catalytic anode, as the
methane molecule is difficult to activate and oxidize electrochem-
ically. Hence, the logical progression to natural gas conversion has

44

T.M. Gür/Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 54 (2016) 1–64

to be built on fundamental understanding of methane oxidation as
the first step toward natural gas utilization in SOFCs.

6.1. Role of theoretical tools in catalyst design

Although much progress has been made in the fundamental un-
derstanding of catalysis and how it relates to materials properties,
much of the prior work for catalyst development has traditionally
been done by an ad hoc approach based mostly on trial-and-error.
However, the advent of massive computational tools and develop-
ment of effective theoretical descriptors have made it possible to
increasingly utilize rational design of catalysts and gain mechanis-
tic understanding of surface reactions [411,546–551]. Effective
methodologies and computational tools are becoming increasing-
ly predictive for designing catalysts for a wide range of diverse
reactions, including methane activation [408], steam reforming of
methane [409,457,552], the oxygen evolution reaction (OER)
[553,554], NH3 synthesis [555], photoelectrochemical water-
splitting reactions [556], and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)
[557].

6.1.1. Computational tools and activity descriptors

As in most catalytic reactions, methane oxidation involves mul-
tiple elementary steps, and individual
identification and
determination of these steps usually pose major difficulties exper-
imentally. Spectroscopic in situ probing and determination of surface
intermediates participating in the catalytic reaction is also quite chal-
lenging and not always possible in operando. In this regard,
computational methods can play an important role in gaining better
insights in understanding the energy barriers associated with re-
action steps and participating intermediates along the reaction
coordinate, as well as rationalizing how and why catalytic activity
changes from one catalyst to the next [546,549]. Reactivity trends
of metal surfaces can be studied by ab initio calculations of activa-
tion barriers for transition states and surface intermediates, from
which one can construct potential energy surfaces for various re-
action pathways and identify the kinetically significant steps in the
reaction pathway to gain mechanistic insights for the reaction. It
has long been recognized that electronic factors play a major role
in catalytic activity [548,558]. Such intrinsic materials properties
can be used as effective descriptors to define catalytic activity and
selectivity [559]. These may include the electronic structure of the
metal catalyst (e.g., d-band energy center for transition metals), which
governs binding energies of adsorbates and hence their surface cov-
erage, and also the nature, geometry and population of active surface
sites. The differences in the catalytic activity of transition metals
can be accounted for by the coupling between the adsorbate valence
states and the d-band electrons of the metal catalyst, such that the
energy of the d-state relative to the Fermi level largely governs this
interaction. The higher the d-state energy, the stronger is the binding
energy of the adsorbate. Also an important consideration to enhance
the rates of catalytic reactions is the correlation that likewise exists
between the transition state energy for surface diffusion and the
adsorption, or the binding energy, of the diffusing species on metal
surfaces. It was proposed as a rule of thumb for many transition
metals that the activation barrier energies for surface diffusion may
be taken to be approximately 12% of the binding energy of the ad-
sorbed state [560].

In catalysis and catalyst design, the Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi (BEP)
rule [561,562] is an effective thinking tool that empirically de-
scribes the linear relationship between the reaction energy, ΔE, of
an elementary reaction step and its activation energy, i.e., the tran-
sition state energy, Ea. One example of the BEP rule is illustrated
in Fig. 19 (see Section 4.2.3) for the case of dissociative adsorption
of methane on stepped Ni(211) and flat Ni(111) surfaces as well as
for several other transition metal surfaces, which shows the

Fig. 37. Linear plot of calculated transition state energies for a number of cou-
pling reactions and their calculated dissociative chemisorption energies on different
stepped surfaces of transition metals Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Ir, Pt, and Au, dem-
onstrating the universality of the Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi relationship. All energies
are taken relative to the gas phase energies of CH4, H2O, NH3, and H2. [Reprinted

interplay between geometrical and electronic effects and the va-
lidity of the linear BEP relationship even for different metals and
surface geometries. Strongly adsorbed species like C or O usually
prefer sites with the highest metal coordination number as on closed
packed Ni(111) surface as opposed to the stepped surface of Ni(211).
This leads to a higher dissociation barrier for methane on the Ni(211)
stepped surface and shifts it to the left of Ni(111). The lower co-
ordination Ni(211) have higher lying d-band states than the Ni atoms
on the closed packed (111) surface, and hence interact more strongly
with the adsorbed intermediates at these sites than the highly co-
ordinated metal atoms on closed packed surfaces. The stronger
binding energy shifts the electronic effect along the BEP line as shown
in Fig. 19.

The universality of the linear BEP rule was demonstrated to hold
more broadly for numerous reaction systems [563] as shown in
Fig. 37. The linear fit to these reactions can then be expressed uni-
versally in terms of the scaling parameters γ and ζ that
represent the slope and the intercept of the linear plot in Fig. 37,
respectively.

(43)

When the change in ζ is much smaller than ΔE, then the reac-
tion mechanism on that metal surface is governed largely by
electronic effects, as is the case for methane hydrogenation, while
geometrical effects become dominant if the change in ζ is signifi-
cantly larger than ΔE on the BEP plot. In recent years, density
functional theory (DFT) calculations have successfully been em-
ployed to show that this linear relation indeed holds for a wide range
of reactions, including NH3 synthesis, CO hydrogenation, and many
others involving hydrocarbons [561,564]. The scaling parameters γ
and ζ of Eqn.(43) for the CHx-O coupling reaction were calculated
to be in the range of 0.77–0.87 and 1.59–2.32, respectively [563].
Note that the calculated best-fit BEP slope of 0.77–0.87 for the
methane oxidation reaction is close to but slightly lower than unity.
Nevertheless, the BEP relation is a useful tool in estimating the ac-
tivation barrier for a given reaction and establishing catalytic trends
among the expected behavior of prospective catalysts.

studying systems of a few hundred atoms to understand the phys-
ical and chemical behaviors of materials. For this purpose, a
computational materials repository has recently been developed at
the Technical University of Denmark and is available for the use of
the scientific community [566,567]. Such major advances in DFT and
other theoretical methodologies enable the study and understand-
ing of surface rate processes and the energetics of reaction
mechanisms and, hence, create the possibility for theory-guided cat-
alyst design. There have been useful developments in this direction.
For example, a web-based application program dubbed CatApp is
now available online [547] and stores energetic information for tran-
sition states and intermediates in elementary reactions on transition
metal surfaces. To make rapid advances in methane catalysis, there
is a need to devise high throughput computational screening of the
materials space for prospective catalysts specifically targeting
methane oxidation.

There have been numerous DFT studies of methane transfor-
mation reactions on individual catalysts. However, many of the DFT
calculations for catalysis reported for methane adsorption [568], ac-
tivation [98,408,569], dehydrogenation [570], and steam reforming
[457,552] reactions have focused only on a single metal catalyst or
at best, on a handful of potential catalysts [409]. With such a small
and narrow sampling, it is difficult to draw generalized conclu-
sions about the best candidates predicted for methane oxidation.
There are only a few examples of first principles studies in
methane catalysis in search of a novel methane steam reforming
catalyst. One DFT study screened several transition metals and alloys,
including precious metals, considered different surfaces for catalyst–
adsorbate interactions, ruled out all precious metals after filtering
the candidates through cost considerations, and finally recom-
mended a short list of several Ni and Co alloys as potentially active
reforming catalysts [409]. Among the recommended were Co3Ni and
Ni3Fe, which are already known to be effective catalysts, but inter-
estingly, the list also included several potential candidates such as
Ni3Ge, Ni3Sb and Co3Ge, which have yet to be investigated and tested
experimentally. A similar study of methane steam reforming ca-
talysis combined DFT calculations with experimental work at 500 °C
and 1 bar pressure and 10% conversion, and evaluated the cata-
lytic activity for different combinations of supported catalyst systems
that considered the metal catalysts Ru, Rh, Ir, Pt, Pd, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu
Ag, Au, and W supported on three oxides, namely ZrO2, Al2O3, and
MgAl2O4 [552]. After eliminating thermodynamically unstable, or
catalytically inactive or easily deactivated metals, and assuming that
the metal–support interactions are negligibly small, good agree-
ment between theoretical and experimental results was reported
for the rank ordering of catalytic activities. While experimental
results ranked the reforming activities as Ru ~ Rh > Ni ~ Ir ~ Pt ~ Pd,
the theoretical predictions followed a similar trend, namely,
Ru > Rh > Ni > Ir > Pt > Pd. Such insights into catalytic trends gained
through computational studies promise important advances in better
understanding and discovery of new catalytically active materials
for methane activation.

An excellent example of high throughput quantum calcula-
tions for massive materials screening and discovery methodologies
relates to the recent computational study in search of identifying
new photoactive electrodes in the perovskite family of oxides for
the photoelectrochemical (PEC) splitting of water using sunlight [551]
[556]. Although this particular example lies outside the topical area
of this article, it is nevertheless presented here in order to dem-
onstrate the exceptional power and potential benefits of such
computational screening methodologies for rapid materials dis-
covery. This study included a matrix of 52 elements of the periodic
table for the A and B cations in the ABO3 perovskite-structure ma-
terials space with 7 different anions and their combinations such
as oxynitrides, oxysulfides, oxyfluorides, resulting in a materials space
of 19,000 different possible compositions. The massive materials

Likewise, effective descriptors such as d-band center (ed) and
binding energy have been identified to construct ‘volcano plots’ that
describe the trends in catalytic activity of metal surfaces, which
provide immense insights into materials screening, selection, and
mechanistic understanding [411]. The d-band center is a good
measure and descriptor of the d-states, as the interaction of the
surface adsorbate valence states with the metal d-states largely
governs the interaction energy (i.e., surface binding energy). The sp
bands of the metals are usually broad and structureless while the
d-bands are narrow such that small changes induced by the adsor-
bate lead to significant changes in the d-band states. A similar
theoretical approach was employed to examine doped perovskite-
based catalytic anodes for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which
showed good correlation between the catalytic activity and the oc-
cupation of the d-states [554,557].

It is well known that catalytic and transport properties of ma-
terials can effectively be altered or improved through appropriate
doping, but experimental testing and verification of the prospec-
tive materials is tedious and time consuming. Density functional
theory (DFT) calculations can provide helpful guidance to estab-
lish trends and devise synthetic strategies toward developing effective
catalysts. For example, RuO2 is the best catalyst for the oxygen evo-
lution reaction (OER) but is expensive, while TiO2 is a poor catalyst
with a high overpotential for OER, but it is cheap and abundant. DFT
studies have suggested that proper doping of TiO2 with transition
metal oxides may significantly enhance its catalytic activity ap-
proaching to that of RuO2. This is shown in Fig. 38, where the
activities of the Cr-, Mo- and Mn-doped TiO2 catalysts approach the
best OER catalyst [553]. In a similar manner, it should be possible
to search computationally for low-cost and abundant catalytic ma-
terials that can effectively and selectively oxidize methane, while
providing significant tolerance against coking and sulfur poison-
ing. Progress in this promising area of predictive computational
design of catalysts will have huge practical implications and ben-
efits for energy research [565].

selection process in these electronic-structure calculations used
chemical stability, Goldschmidt’s tolerance factor for structural sta-
bility, and band gap as the key criteria to qualify prospective
candidates for potential photoelectrodes. Out of the 19,000 com-
positions that were investigated, only about 20 perovskite
compositions possessed the required light harvesting and stabili-
ty properties for a one-photon PEC process for water splitting
[571,572]. This is shown in Fig. 39, which also indicates the corre-
sponding positions of the redox potentials for water with respect
to the band gaps of the candidate materials. For PEC activity, the
band gap needs to straddle the redox potential of water for an ef-
fective and efficient photoelectrode. Furthermore, the overvoltage
losses associated with the hydrogen reduction reaction (HRR) at the
cathode and the oxygen evolution reactions (OER) at the anode with
respect to the positions of the band gap place additional con-
straints on the materials screening process and bring the numbers
of candidate materials further down to only a handful, some of
which, such as the oxynitrides, have not being investigated yet for
photoelectrode applications.

Equally important is the ability to predict relative stability of the
candidate materials in the working cell environments. For this
purpose, DFT calculations were successfully employed to con-
struct surface Pourbaix (i.e., potential–pH) diagrams for various
oxides and perovskites considered as candidate photoelectrodes to
evaluate their relative stabilities against corrosion in the aqueous
photoelectrochemical cell environment [573]. Although this par-
ticular system, especially the concept of pH, may not be directly
relevant to high temperature methane conversion in SOFCs, but this
theoretical approach points to invaluable opportunities to use DFT
calculations to construct instead surface Pourbaix diagrams to predict
materials stability under SOFC operating conditions. As surface acidity
plays a major role in the activation of the C—H bond for methane
catalysis (see Sections 3.1.1 and 3.3), the concept of surface acidity
may be employed in place of pH to provide meaningful guidance
to materials screening and selection processes for the design and
development of advanced catalytic anodes for methane oxidation.
It is clear that these massive screening methodologies afforded
by theoretical computations are becoming invaluable tools to es-

tablish trends, predict semiqualitative information about expected
properties, provide guidance to experimental research and verifi-
cation, and greatly expedite the development time line for novel
catalytic materials. This holds particularly true for the rapid devel-
opment of sulfur-tolerant catalytic anodes for direct oxidation and
conversion of natural gas for power generation in SOFCs.

6.1.2. Mechanistic understanding of reaction pathways

A detailed mechanistic understanding of how catalysis occurs
at the atomic scale and how to effectively design and control matter
for catalyzed transformations has been identified as one of the grand
challenges for basic energy research needs by the U.S. Department
of Energy [565]. Major breakthroughs in the understanding of ca-
talysis and design of advanced catalysts are expected to result from
advances in theoretical and computational methods [574]. Such in-
depth understanding is essential to design and modify catalytic
behavior of matter at the atomic scale in order to accomplish se-
lective catalysis of the desired reaction product(s) with sufficient
rates. This in turn requires accurate prediction and understanding
of the energetics of intermediate species, especially transition states,
along the reaction pathways at the level of elementary steps that
may lead to the identification of the minimum energy pathways.
Indeed, the DFT approach can effectively be used to estimate the
interaction energies of atomic or molecular species with metal sur-
faces and to establish catalytic trends in activity and selectivity [575].
Use of these computational tools to screen materials properties and
map out the possible candidates to be synthesized and tested ex-
perimentally in the laboratory is an effective, fast and low cost way
of developing new catalysts. In other words, electronic structure cal-
culations for materials screening combined with quantum calculations
of the energy landscape along the reaction pathways offer invalu-
able information to guide catalyst design and development.

Despite the large number of DFT studies on chemical transfor-
mations of methane, only a handful has been for the catalytic
oxidation of methane, while most investigated catalytic routes toward
higher value chemicals or syngas. A DFT study of steam reforming

employed a statistical mechanical treatment to account for en-
tropic effects and identified the primary reaction pathway, which
involved the dissociative adsorption of CH4(g) to CH* in addition to
dissociative adsorption of H2O(g) into 2H* and O* [576]. The rate de-
termining steps were found to be the adsorption of CH4(g), and the
surface reaction between adsorbed species CH* and O* to form
CHOH*. A more relevant DFT study involved methane oxidation over
Pd(111), PdO(100), CeO2(111), and PdxCe1 − xO2(111) catalytic sur-
faces for CH4 and O2 gas mixtures with partial pressures of 0.01 atm
and 0.04 atm, respectively [98]. This computational study exam-
ined the relative stabilities of the intermediate species and evaluated
the energy barriers for methane activation on the Pd/CeO2 cata-
lytic system. It was found that the PdxCe1 − xO2(111) surface offered
the most favorable energy profile and the lowest activation barrier
for the methane oxidation reaction. This is presented in Fig. 40, which
shows the reaction free energy profile for the catalytic oxidation of
methane over PdxCe1 − xO2(111) catalyst. Again, the reaction pathway
for methane adsorption is initiated by the activation of the first C—H
bond and abstraction of the resulting H by the surface oxygen to
form CH3*.

Unfortunately, literature on first principles calculations specif-
ically looking at anodic oxidation of dry methane in SOFCs is quite
scarce. Among the few studies, two of them specifically address
methane oxidation on the Ni/YSZ anode. A DFT study examined
methane adsorption and oxidation on bare YSZ surface [577] to es-
tablish a baseline for a similar subsequent study that investigated
methane oxidation at the Ni/YSZ interface of the SOFC anode [578].
DFT studies of methane on YSZ(111) and ZrO2(111) surfaces indi-
cated that subsequent filling of the vacant sites by externally supplied
oxygen was a mandatory energetic condition to achieve adsorp-
tion and oxidation. This is because the dissociative adsorption of
methane on YSZ(111) and ZrO2(111) was found to be highly endo-
thermic, and rendered these surfaces practically inactive unless
oxygen is supplied through the YSZ electrolyte from the cathode
side. By contrast, dissociative adsorption of methane on oxygen-
enriched YSZ(111) surface was found to be exothermic and this
surface was highly reactive to methane oxidation. As the oxygen
vacancy content of YSZ is fixed primarily by the degree of extrin-
sic doping, the results suggest that a better anode support material
may be ceria, which can tolerate some degree of nonstoichiometry

6.2. Lattice strain effects in catalysis

Strain effects between lattice-mismatched overlayers may provide
exciting new opportunities and an effective lever to tune catalytic
properties of materials. Elastic strain can be induced in several dif-
ferent ways into materials including lattice mismatch at interfaces
in multilayers, by applied stress, or by chemical expansion as ob-
served in nonstoichiometric and doped oxides, and particularly in
MIEC oxides.

The mismatch in the lattice constants across an interface between
layers induces strain in the overlayer, which may alter the cata-
lytic properties of the strained surface. Inspired partly by epitaxial
film studies, DFT calculations have predicted long ago that the
chemisorption properties of the strained Ru(0001) surface can be
quite different from the unstrained Ru(0001) surface, and re-
ported significantly lower binding energies and activation barriers
for CO and O chemisorption on the strained Ru(0001) surface [579].
Experimental verification of the theoretical predictions was imme-
diately provided by a scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) study
of oxygen and CO adsorption on Ru(0001) surface, which indeed in-
dicated that preferential adsorption of oxygen and formation of
surface superstructures occurs where the substrate lattice is
stretched, while regions of the Ru(0001) substrate that is under com-
pressive strain are the least favorable for adsorption [580]. Further
studies by DFT also reported lower barrier for N2 dissociation on
strained fcc-Fe(111) surface and the Ru(0001) surface covered with
a monolayer of Fe [581], while no correlation or general trend was
found for dissociative adsorption of H2 on Cu(111), (100), and (110)
surfaces as a function of lattice strain [582].

Exceptionally large lattice strains in ultrathin epitaxial metal films
that can reach values as high as 6.5% had been reported before [583].
More recently, an eight orders of magnitude increase in electrical
conductivity was reported [584] for epitaxial heterostructures made
of 1 nm thick YSZ films sandwiched between 1–10 nm thick SrTiO3
layers. Although the ionic nature of the observed increase in con-
ductivity in this superlattice structure is still in debate [585], this
work sparked renewed interest in the role of elastic strain in the
surface kinetics and transport properties in oxide structures [586].
In fact, scanning tunnel microscopy studies of O2 and CO adsorp-
tion on strained Ru(0001) surface locally induced by the formation
of subsurface gas bubbles have shown that adsorption is weaker in
regions of lateral dilatation of the lattice and stronger in regions
under compressive strain around the rim of the bubble [580]. In other
words, tensile strained lattice exhibits preferential adsorption, and
hence higher catalytic activity. It is clear that strain can alter the
energy barrier profile of surface adsorbates along the reaction co-
ordinate and modify catalytic activity.

As a strategic tool to affect and enhance catalysis, it has been
shown that near-surface alloying alters the surface electronic struc-
ture of the host material and provides an effective methodology to
design catalysts that possess high activity and selectivity [550].
Indeed, it was shown that the binding energies of hydrogen and
oxygen of Pt can be altered significantly by subsurface alloying [587].
A strained metal overlayer on top of another metal substrate ex-
hibits significantly different catalytic activity, compared with the
metal overlayer itself [579]. In the case of doped-perovskites, the
chemical expansion [588] that is due to the large oxygen non-
stoichiometry sustained by these materials helps provide an
additional lever to tune strain and modify surface kinetics and ca-
talysis on these oxides. In general, the reaction energies for various
surface rate processes are expected to decrease with increasing lattice
strain, which is generally expected to lower the oxygen vacancy for-
mation energy by weakening the metal–oxygen bonds. For example,
DFT studies have shown that vacancy formation energy on the
perovskite LaCoO3(100) surface decreases with increasing
elastic strain, which leads to increased concentration of oxygen

tion pathways for the dissociation (blue lines) and oxygenation (red lines) of methane

in the oxygen sublattice to supply the much needed lattice oxygen
for methane oxidation.

In a subsequent study of methane oxidation at the Ni/YSZ tpb,
the DFT findings indicated that not only the YSZ surface of the
Ni/YSZ system was chemically inert, but more surprisingly, the
oxygen-enriched YSZ surface of the Ni/YSZ anode was also found
to be inactive for methane adsorption due to a high endothermic
kinetic barrier [578]. The Ni surface of the Ni/YSZ cermet, however,
was catalytically active and the energetics of the reaction path-
ways were qualitatively very similar to that of pure bulk Ni without
the YSZ support. This is presented in Fig. 41, which shows the com-
parative energy profiles of the surface intermediates along the
reaction pathways for the dissociative adsorption and oxygen-
ation of methane on Ni/YSZ as well as on pure Ni surfaces. The
similarity of the profiles between the two catalyst systems is quite
obvious, suggesting that YSZ in the Ni-based cermet does not play
an active role in the electrocatalytic reaction other than transfer-
ring of oxygen.

It should be noted that although DFT has emerged as the pre-
ferred method to simulate catalysis, it has several drawbacks and
inherent limitations that need to be taken into account in the in-
terpretation of results and relative comparisons to establish trends,
especially in simulating electrocatalysis in fuel cells, which in reality
involves electrified interfaces between the electrode and the solid
or liquid electrolyte. In most ab initio calculations, the canonical
form keeps the number of electrons constant, whereas simulation
of electrochemical systems often requires constant potential. The
DFT functionals also fail to properly account for weak interactions
such as hydrogen or van de Waals bonding. Although DFT works
well for metals, the same is not necessarily true for metal oxide
systems. The critical issue for the latter is the density functionals
that can behave differently for the different transition metals in
the oxide structure. Moreover, convergence of the band gap from
the cluster to the bulk is also important. These require new ad-
vances to make the necessary improvements in these useful and
powerful computational methods. Recognizing these limitations
and uncertainties, theoretical computational methodologies should
be employed with caution and not as quantitative tools but for
establishing qualitative trends, scaling relationships, and design rule
guidelines.

ing temperatures minimize issues related to materials stability and
compatibility while improving microstructural and morphologi-
cal stability under prolonged use. Moreover, this opens up
opportunities for inexpensive materials for cell components that oth-
erwise could not be considered. Hence, there is clear advantage in
lowering the manufacturing and operating temperatures of SOFCs
to below 500 °C [273].

Earlier efforts to reduce the SOFC operating temperature to in-
termediate regime of 600–800 °C [268,591,592] have focused on thick
film ceramic processing techniques to reduce the thickness of the
YSZ electrolyte membrane down to about 10 μm. Development of
such intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells, dubbed IT-
SOFCs, has gained much interest and was largely made possible by
adopting thinner or alternative electrolytes such as doped ceria-,
bismuth oxide-, or lanthanum gallate-based oxide ion conductors,
and superior catalytic electrodes [261,273,288,311,590,593,594].
Others have attempted fabrication of thin film SOFC electrolyte mem-
branes around 1 μm thick using thin film deposition or MEMS
techniques [595,596].

Efforts for lowering the cell operating temperature involved pri-
marily two major strategies, namely, reducing the thickness of the
electrolyte, and improving the electrode kinetics. The ohmic loss
across the solid electrolyte is a significant fraction of the total cell
losses especially at low temperatures. Hence, fabrication of thin
electrolyte membranes significantly reduces ohmic losses. Ad-
vances in fabrication techniques allowed the manufacturing of
cathode-supported or anode-supported SOFC architectures, where
the solid electrolyte component of the cell is typically around 10 μm
thick.

As most SOFC work employed H2 as the fuel whose oxidation
kinetics is relatively fast, most of the attention to minimize the cell
activation losses was focused on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)
at the cathode. As reaction rates generally exhibit Arrhenius-type
behavior, low temperature operation also requires catalytically su-
perior electrodes. In other words, developing catalytic materials as
well as thin film pinhole-free electrolyte membranes are critically
important in order to achieve practically high cell performance and
efficiency at low operating temperatures.

Although relatively inexpensive and pinhole-free fabrication of
thin electrolyte membranes by conventional ceramic processing (e.g.,
tape casting) is limited to thicknesses around 10 μm in general, ad-
vances in chemical and physical vapor deposition methods such as
atomic layer deposition (ALD), sputtering, and pulsed laser depo-
sition (PLD) offer major advantages in pushing the membrane
thickness further below the 1 μm level. These deposition tech-
niques have already been employed commercially for mass
fabrication of a wide variety of large area thin film materials for the
electronic, optical, and other industries. Indeed, ultra-thin self-
standing YSZ and GDC electrolyte membrane layers with nominal
thicknesses around 100 nm have been successfully deposited
by sputtering [597–599], PLD [600,601], and ALD methods
[231,602,603].

These efforts helped lower the SOFC operating temperature to
below 500 °C without sacrificing on cell performance. For example,
an exceptionally high power density of 1.34 W/cm2 was achieved
with H2 fuel at 450 °C for a 43 × 43 μm size self-standing MEA sup-
ported on silicon wafer and featuring 60 nm thick pinhole-free
composite YSZ/YDC electrolyte [604]. This self-standing
3-dimensional conformally nanostructured MEA fabricated on a Si-
substrate is illustrated in Fig. 43. Similarly, planar or 3-dimensional
ultra thin film (~100 nm) functional MEA architectures based either
on YSZ oxide ion membranes [604,605] or BYZ-based proton con-
ducting solid oxide electrolytes [606] have demonstrated high power
densities of practical importance.

It should be noted, however, that the long-term stability as well
as cost limitations with such ultra thin film SOFC architectures have

vacancies with more active sites for oxygen exchange that in turn
leads to lowering of the binding energy for oxygen [589]. This is il-
lustrated in Fig. 42, where the upturn in the trends in the two
energies was attributed to the abrupt increase in the magnetic
moment seen at ~3% strain.

For similar reasons, strain effects may also be important for ionic
transport. For example, DFT studies including kinetic Monte Carlo
simulations for oxide ion transport in biaxially strained YSZ lattice
indicated that with increasing lattice strain, the oxide ion diffusivity
increases exponentially up to a factor of 6.8 × 103 until a critical strain
value is reached, after which the diffusivity decreases possibly due
to relaxation processes beyond the elastic bond strain limit [585].
This effect is especially more pronounced at lower temperatures than
at high.

This author is not aware of experimental or theoretical studies
reported to date that have specifically investigated the role of strain
on the activation of the C—H bond for the catalytic oxidation of
methane, which would provide interesting and useful insights. The
examples provided above on how surface binding energies and
barrier heights can be altered or modified by inducing lattice strain
opens up new opportunities for developing advanced catalysts for
C—H bond activation and incorporating strained layers on to SOFC
anode structures for enhanced oxidation of methane.

6.3. Lowering the SOFC operating temperature

The high operating temperature is considered a major stum-
bling block for the rapid commercialization and mass deployment
of SOFC technology. Most SOFC research and development efforts
still employ high operating temperatures above 800 °C, which pose
major challenges for the cost and stability of SOFC components.
This necessitates the use of primarily ceramic components and spe-
cialized high temperature metal alloys for the SOFC stack and the
balance of plant (BOP) for the system. The resulting high costs as-
sociated with both fabrication and materials render this temperature
regime undesirable and expensive for SOFC, especially for small
size combined heat and power (CHP) systems. Furthermore, high
temperature operation promotes undesirable thermal cracking of
the hydrocarbon fuel inside the SOFC and subsequent deactiva-
tion of the anode and/or clogging of the system due to carbon
deposition.

It was recognized nearly two decades ago that lowering the op-
erating temperature of SOFCs also helps lower an important barrier
to their commercialization [590]. Low manufacturing and operat-

effective alternatives, minimize adverse solid state reactions and
segregation effects resulting from high temperature processing steps
during SOFC manufacturing, and lead to lower materials and fab-
rication costs.

So in the context of hydrocarbon conversion in SOFCs, it may be
premature to predict or judge at this time whether the advan-
tages of lowering the operating temperature will clearly outweigh
the major risks and disadvantages it will bring along, especially for
natural gas utilization, where the presence of sulfur may ultimate-
ly be Achilles’ heel. It is likely that advances in both catalyst research
and SOFC materials development will bear on this choice.

As hydrogen has typically been the preferred fuel, studies of
methane utilization in thin film SOFCs have been quite scarce. One
notable example among them is the report of a peak power density
of 450 mW/cm2 achieved at 500 °C using humidified methane as
fuel in a Si-supported thin film SOFC architecture with a total MEA
thickness of ~180 nm that featured a 30 nm Ru anode deposited on
a 80 nm thick YSZ electrolyte [422]. The most notable accomplish-
ment shown in Fig. 44 achieved a remarkable cell performance in
a similar thin film SOFC architecture, where peak power densities
of 410 and 800 mW/cm2 were obtained at 500 °C using dry and 3%
humidified natural gas, respectively, on porous Ru anode [424]. These
few but encouraging examples of methane conversion in thin film
SOFCs with remarkably high power densities obtained at such low
temperatures may pave the way for renewed interest and advance-
ments in this direction.

not been fully tested and validated yet. Moreover, undesirable rate
processes such as interdiffusion, demixing, and defect segregation
due to reduced diffusional distances in these thin films may com-
promise performance and long-term stability. Likewise, the cost of
metalorganic specialty precursors used for deposition may not par-
ticularly be suitable for fabrication of wide area, large power output
SOFCs. Nevertheless, this thin film approach opens up a window
for new opportunities to seek and develop better and cheaper meth-
odologies for further reduction of the SOFC operating temperature
for direct utilization and conversion of hydrocarbons.

For hydrocarbon conversion, however, low temperature SOFC op-
eration is still a debatable issue with a long list of pros and cons.
Aside from significantly slowed rate processes and surface kinet-
ics, lowering the operating temperature is expected to have two
additional adverse effects on the SOFC performance. As discussed
in detail above, it is expected that both carbon deposition (see Section
5.1) and sulfur poisoning (see Section 5.2) problems may pose more
difficult challenges at lower temperatures due primarily to ther-
mochemical considerations. Not only the binding of sulfurous species
to Ni and other transition metal surfaces is stronger at lower tem-
peratures and may lead to irreversible deactivation, but also the
carbon deposition boundary of the C—H—O ternary system expands
with decreasing temperature (see C—H—O phase diagram in Fig. 25),
and thus favoring coking. In this regard, development of advanced
catalytic anodes will be as critical as optimization of cell fabrica-
tion and operation parameters to avoid or minimize these adverse
effects.

On the positive side, low operating temperatures offer many
benefits. Low temperatures are expected to avoid the ther-
modynamically-driven gas-phase cracking of the hydrocarbon fuels
employed in SOFCs, reduce solubility of carbon in Ni and other tran-
sition metal catalytic anodes and slow down the kinetics of coking,
help improve the conversion efficiency by thermodynamically fa-
voring the formation of CO2 as opposed to CO and in this context
also favor the full oxidation and water–gas shift reactions, slows
down cell degradation processes due to microstructural changes or
interactions and interdiffusion across interfaces between cell com-
ponents, expand the materials space for SOFC components into cost-

7. Prospects for natural gas conversion in SOFCs

Natural gas is a naturally occurring primary energy source that
is also widely available through a vast transportation and distri-
bution infrastructure already in place and is made of networks of
gas pipelines, compression and liquefaction facilities and stations,
and specialized transportation vehicles, trains and ships. However,
the composition of natural gas is not fixed but varies widely with
the geographic location of the gas field as well as the geologic for-
mation and reservoir it is extracted from. A typical composition [607]
is provided in Table 6. Natural gas may also contain other contami-
nants, such as mercaptans (R-SH), carbonyl sulfide (COS), and carbon
disulfide (CS2) in trace quantities. Mercury (Hg) may also be present
in the vapor phase. When natural gas is primarily made of methane
after all other hydrocarbons are removed, it is considered “dry”. Oth-
erwise it is “wet”, when other hydrocarbons are present. Such
variation places additional constraints in utilizing natural gas di-
rectly without pretreatment as the higher hydrocarbons are unstable
at typical SOFC operating temperatures and tend to crack, deacti-
vating and degrading cell performance. Natural gas also takes on
different names depending on the nature and origin, including: sour
(sulfur containing) or sweet (desulfurized) gas; non-associated gas
or well-gas, which does not contain hydrocarbons higher than
methane; associated gas, which is associated with crude oil pro-
duction; coal bed methane, which is held in coal beds; and shale
gas, which is extracted by hydraulic fracturing from shale forma-
tions. Such variability in both hydrocarbon composition and sulfur
content place significant challenges and demands on SOFC com-
ponents, but especially more so on the catalytic anode. Furthermore,
also note that sulfur-based odorants are purposefully injected into
natural gas for ease of detection by smell. In other words, flexibil-
ity and sufficient tolerance for sulfur must be built into the design
and development of the catalytic anodes. This is a critical require-
ment to accommodate and convert such variant compositions of
natural gas in SOFCs without the need for extensive pretreatment.
It is clear that conversion of natural gas in SOFCs as opposed to
combustion offers significant environmental benefits. Gas-phase
combustion of natural gas in air proceeds within the flammability
limits (i.e., 4–15 vol% in air) with flame temperatures that can be
as high as 1600 °C, which promotes the formation of an unwanted
pollutant and potent greenhouse gas NOx (see Table 4) from the re-
action of N2 with O2 at these elevated temperatures. Furthermore,
the CO2 content of the combustion flue gases is typically around 5%
with the balance primarily N2, which requires costly post-separation
operations to capture CO2. By contrast, the typical SOFC operating
temperature (~800 °C) is significantly lower and no N2 from the air
can enter the process stream. Hence, formation of undesirable NOx
is discouraged under these conditions and eliminated for all prac-
tical purposes. Also, as N2 is completely kept out of the conversion
process, the flue stream from the SOFC does not contain any N2, but
is made of concentrated CO2 that eliminates the need for post
separation.

Significant improvements on the cost-effective and environmen-
tally responsible utilization of natural gas can be achieved by
conversion in SOFCs as discussed above in this article. With an ex-
tensive distribution infrastructure in place, SOFCs are ideally suited
to run on natural gas and can readily provide environmentally friend-
ly and efficient production of electrical power in a distributed fashion.
However, commercial realization of this goal without pretreat-
ment operations will require advancements in the current SOFC
materials and technology to accommodate acceptable levels of sulfur
and carbon tolerance while maintaining high power densities for
practically meaningful performance.

As known for a long time in the catalysis and chemical indus-
tries, sulfur poisoning is clearly a persistent and difficult challenge
for SOFC catalytic anodes also. From published results, the accept-
able levels for Ni-based SOFC anodes seem to be close to 1 ppm,
which is a threshold that is difficult to meet and maintain cost ef-
fectively. On the other hand, the variance in sulfur tolerance for
alloyed-Ni, non-Ni, or oxide-based catalytic anodes covers a sig-
nificantly wider range. There is an obvious need for establishing
selection criteria that encompasses and optimizes sulfur and carbon
tolerance with respect to catalytic activity, as all are critically im-
portant for high efficiency, and cell performance and stability. An
added complication is introduced by the large variation in the con-
centrations of sulfurous species (ppm level up to 1%) and other
contaminants in natural gas, which in return would demand more
robust flexibility for the sulfur tolerance level of the catalytic anode,
as well as other SOFC components such as current collectors. Wide
flexibility and high tolerance will be critically important in order
to accept natural gas feeds from different origins without signifi-
cant reduction in SOFC performance and long service life.

However, the key to realizing this goal is the development of su-
perior catalytic electrodes for SOFCs. The materials, operational and
stability challenges for SOFC anodes are discussed in detail in the
preceding sections above, but there are also major challenges to do
the same for the development of catalytic materials for the cathode
in order to lower the large activation losses due to the sluggish
oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on this electrode. Similarly, one
can argue that there is need for superior solid electrolytes with higher
ionic conductivity and lower activation barrier for ionic transport
than the ones currently available, and with sufficiently wide sta-
bility window so that the next generation SOFCs can operate in the
low temperature regime below 500 °C with high efficiency and high
power density. Certainly making the electrolyte membranes thinner
is helpful to lower the temperature, but what is really needed is a
major breakthrough in the inherent properties of materials.
Nanostructuring with rational design may offer new opportuni-
ties in this direction for the development of the next generation SOFC
electrolytes and catalytic electrodes.

In this regard, a comprehensive approach that draws upon the
basic principles depicted by the “new” materials octahedron shown
in Fig. 45 provides the basis for rational design and development
of advanced materials for SOFC functional components with supe-
rior properties and performance. Recent additions of theoretical and
computational tools as well as the ability to control matter at the
nanoscale, i.e., nanostructuring, allow new directions for bottom-
up design and development of novel catalytic and functional
materials for next generation SOFCs. Use of theoretical simula-
tions for qualitative prediction of comparative trends in materials
properties has proved effective and useful, but for rational design
of novel and practical materials, such predictive tools need to extend
into the multi-scale domain to bridge the gap from quantum to con-
tinuum, and complemented by experimental validation and in situ
and in operando characterization. Similarly, the newly gained ability
to nanostructure materials at the nanoscale expands the domain
of materials space immensely with the possibility to alter, modify
or fabricate new materials structures with exceptional properties

shown improved catalytic activity for methane oxidation, achiev-
ing a maximum power density of 350 mW/cm2 at 800 °C [611]. It
should be pointed out, however, that nanostructures generally suffer
from poor thermal and microstructural stability and may not main-
tain their geometric size, shape, or architecture at elevated
temperatures after prolonged use. Hence, it is important to lower
the operating temperatures of SOFCs to below 500 °C to be able to
implement the benefits offered by nanostructured materials into
SOFC cell design and architecture.

It is clear that strain effects also play an important role in the
catalytic properties of surfaces. By fine-tuning the interfacial ge-
ometry and the associated strain, it may be possible to optimize the
adsorption properties of reaction intermediates and dramatically
enhance the catalytic rates of heterogeneous reactions. These strat-
egies naturally open up new opportunities in further tuning of
catalytic properties particularly for direct utilization and oxida-
tion of natural gas on SOFC anodes.

To gain better mechanistic insights for methane catalysis, another
opportunity is offered by the use of sophisticated analytical tools
that probe in unprecedented detail into the crystal and electronic
structures of materials as well as in the identification of surface in-
termediates and active sites, or changes in oxidation states in the
catalysts during catalytic reactions. These tools are becoming in-
creasingly accessible particularly through the advancements made
in synchrotron based x-ray techniques that offer both in situ and
in operando measurements of materials behavior, properties, and
even 3-dimensional microstructural imaging for a wide range of
energy conversion processes and systems [247,612–614]. These ad-
vanced tools and techniques also offer opportunities to conduct in
situ study of electrocatalysis at gas pressures as high as 100 Torr at
room temperature [615], or in a total pressure of 300 mTorr and
between 550 and 750 °C [333]. In addition, low energy ion scatter-
ing spectroscopy (LEIS) provides atomic scale precision in identifying
elemental surface species at the very top atomic layer of catalyst
surfaces, and provides a rare glimpse at surface species and pro-
cesses including catalysis, defect segregation, and nucleation and
growth [616,617]. The newly developed X-ray laser capability (Linac
Coherent Light Source (LCLS)) at DOE’s SLAC National Accelerator
Laboratory in California provides high intensity pulses in the 10–
100 × 10−15 s (femtosecond) time-scale, which is commensurate with
typical lifetimes of surface intermediates. This unique capability offers
unprecedented opportunities to monitor and follow catalytic re-
actions in real time. Such a battery of powerful analytical tools will
help advance our understanding of catalytic processes and mate-
rials properties in situ and in real time.

There have been several successful attempts that demon-
strated natural gas conversion in SOFCs at low temperatures with
significant power densities. An anode-supported SOFC with 25 μm
thick film YSZ electrolyte membrane and Ni/YSZ porous cermet
anode achieved close to 1 W/cm2 at 800 °C using humidified natural
gas [433]. However, the long-term stability of the Ni/YSZ anode in
the sulfurous environment of natural gas is questionable. Recent pro-
gress in thin film micro-SOFCs have improved the cell performance
by achieving low temperature oxidation of natural gas on nanoporous
Ru anode with considerable power densities of 410 W/cm2 and
440 W/cm2 at 500 °C with dry natural gas and methane, respec-
tively, while a remarkably high power density of 800 mW/cm2 was
achieved at 500 °C using slightly humidified natural gas (see Fig. 44
above) [424]. The scalability of micro-SOFCs to even 1 kW scale,
however, is a debatable issue. So the projection of these promis-
ing results into large-scale practical SOFC systems remains an open
question. Nevertheless, the results are important in guiding future
SOFC research into achieving higher performance values with cost
effective and durable electrode materials.

Certainly, SOFCs are ideally suited for distributed power gener-
ation. Numerous studies developed models to optimize operating

for advanced components for SOFCs. Controlling matter at the atomic
scale and fabricating functional materials with nanoscale preci-
sion offer unprecedented opportunities for developing, for example,
3-dimensional catalytic electrodes architectures with optimized tpb
site density, mass transport, mechanical robustness and thermal
properties for electrocatalytically superior next generation SOFC elec-
trodes. The strategic pathway and the tools to achieve such rapid
progress have been presented thoughtfully in a recent article [608].
Nanostructuring allows tuning and sometimes even altering the
fundamental properties of materials [609]. For example, the recent
development of CuO nanowire (NW) catalytic structures illus-
trated in Fig. 46 were grown by thermal annealing of Cu mesh and
showed significant enhancement in the catalytic rates for methane
oxidation, up to 40% above the rates measured over CuO
nanoparticles and bulk CuO powder [610]. Moreover, CuO NWs
treated under H2 plasma and partially reduced to Cu+ has shown
even higher activity for methane oxidation than untreated NWs, in-
dicating that Cu+ is a more effective catalyst than Cu++. Also, Cu NWs
with 1-dimensional structures expose higher density of active crystal
planes to the reaction environment, which of course lead to in-
creased catalytic activity. This work also showed that CuO NWs are
good oxidation catalysts for methane while Cu+ NWs may even be
better, whereas metallic Cu is not an effective catalyst for this re-
action [378,380]. Similarly, modification of catalytic SDC anode
surfaces by nanostructured decorations of La0.6Ca0.4Fe0.8Ni0.2O3 has

parameters and predict system level performance of SOFCs using
methane or natural gas with direct or indirect reforming com-
bined either with a bottoming power cycle or micro gas turbine,
or simply utilizing the SOFC waste heat [618]. A model study con-
sidering a combined cycle natural gas conversion in SOFCs that also
utilizes the high grade waste heat of the SOFC exhaust gases in a
Rankine or Brayton cycle, or use it for heating purposes, has pre-
dicted remarkable efficiencies up to 90% for the combined system
depending on its configuration [619]. Such high efficiencies natu-
rally translate into reduced CO2 emissions during power generation.
A comparative study of combining the SOFC either with steam or
dry internal reforming reported that conversion efficiencies up to
65% are possible, and that the dry reforming pathway offers a sig-
nificant reduction in CO2 emissions per unit of electricity generated.
The emission factor predicted by this study is about 299 kg of CO2
per MWh of electricity generated, which represents a major reduc-
tion in emissions compared to 367 kg of CO2/MWh for natural gas
combined cycle (NGCC) and 762 kg of CO2/MWh for pulverized coal
(PC) power generation plants [620].

The potential of reducing CO2 emissions by efficient conver-
sion of methane in SOFCs is also important for mitigating global
climate change. However, this represents only part of the problem.
The other aspect of the problem relates to methane emissions into
the environment. The high potency of methane as a greenhouse gas
with a global warming potential of 21 times that of CO2 (see Table 4)
requires large scale mitigation efforts to contain and reduce methane
emissions. Unfortunately, the energy sector is the largest contrib-
utor to methane emissions with nearly 1774 Mton CO2 equivalent
released annually into the environment, which makes up nearly 29%
of total global CH4 emissions. Of this amount, nearly 62% of the
emitted methane originates from natural gas and oil production and
transportation systems, followed in smaller quantities by coal mining,
biomass combustion, etc. [621]. It is not clear if these numbers also
include or account for flared natural gas at the gas or production
sites and plants, which would add a significant fraction that is
energy-wise wasted and emitted into the atmosphere as CO2. Re-
gardless, efficient utilization and conversion of methane on-site by
SOFCs will help reduce emissions and produce distributed power
for use in local communities.

However, there are techno-economic barriers for large-scale adop-
tion of SOFC technology by industry, particularly by power
generators. This is partly because reliability and cost are two of the
several most critical tenets upon which the power production busi-
ness is built. In this regard, SOFCs will have to prove themselves for
cost-effective utility scale power generation. As renewable tech-
nologies such as wind and solar are increasingly being deployed,
the price structure, reliability, grid compatibility, and percent avail-
ability of different power generation systems become even more
competitive, especially if CO2 capture and sequestration require-
ments, if implemented and enforced, are taken into account.
Understandably by the competitive nature of their business, con-
ventional power production companies prefer to remain risk-
averse and conservative before they may make major commitments
to adopt new technologies.

Such reluctance may be mitigated by placing a realistic price on
the carbon released into the environment, as well as with federal
programs and subsidies to encourage the discovery and develop-
ment of advanced technologies for power generation. Indeed, federal
subsidies from the U.S. government have certainly been helpful to
SOFC developers such as Bloom Energy of California, arguably the
biggest commercial developer and manufacturer of SOFCs based on
methane conversion (via reforming), to remain competitive on the
energy marketplace. However, it is difficult to predict the long-
term market prospects of SOFCs beyond such subsidies from the U.S.
government. Elsewhere in the world, similar financial incentives and
programs from federal and local governments are needed to en-

courage both the public and industries to gradually adopt this
technology for rapid deployment. Mass production is expected to
help bring down materials and fabrication costs, but long-term sta-
bility of SOFCs is still a concern that needs to be overcome to comfort
and assure the early adopters and risk takers. This author also be-
lieves that the implementation of a price on carbon is required to
accelerate the commercial development and adoption of ad-
vanced power generation technologies that offer significantly higher
efficiencies and reduced emissions.

As elaborated in this article, methane conversion in SOFCs offers
many attractive advantages including conversion efficiency. A com-
parative study of system level conversion efficiencies and cost-of-
electricity (COE) estimates by the U.S. Department of Energy [622]
clearly highlights the advantages of methane conversion in SOFC
as presented in Fig. 47, which also takes into account the cost and
energy burden for carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). Not only
SOFC-based natural gas (NGFC) conversion offers the highest pos-
sible conversion efficiency at the power systems level, but it is also
predicted to be the most cost-effective technology offering the lowest
COE among the other coal- and natural gas-based power genera-
tion systems.

To realize these goals, the SOFC federal program of the U.S. De-
partment of Energy (DOE) has been providing support for research
and development projects that run on externally reformed natural
gas in SOFC stacks, and aims to develop power systems capable of
producing 250 kW in FY2018 and 1 MW by FY 2020 from natural
gas. This federal program requires stringent cost ($225/kW for stack
and $900/kW for power system) and performance criteria of
40,000 hours of service lifetime with less than 0.2% degradation (cur-
rently 1–1.5%) in SOFC system output power per 1000 hours of
continuous operation [622]. Significant progress made in this long
running DOE program (formerly called SECA for “Strategic Energy
Conversion Alliance”) that has already invested a total of $600M pro-
vides optimism to achieve these targets.

In summary, natural gas conversion in SOFCs promise major ad-
vantages in more efficient utilization of energy sources with a
significantly smaller carbon-footprint, albeit with technical and eco-
nomic challenges yet to be overcome.

8. Summary and conclusions

This article presents a comprehensive review of methane oxi-
dation catalysis toward the ultimate goal of effective utilization and
efficient conversion of natural gas in SOFCs for power generation.
In this context, it covers a vast materials space from metals to
complex oxides for heterogeneous catalysis, and predominantly ionic
as well as mixed ionically and electronically conducting (MIEC)
oxides for ionic and electronic charge transport, and also for
electrocatalytic electrodes for SOFCs. Again in the context of methane
oxidation, it discusses fundamental concepts and phenomena un-
derlying electrochemical conversion, SOFC materials and
performance loss mechanisms, electronic and geometrical effects
in catalysis, catalyst–support interactions, mechanistic insights in
methane activation, spillover and NEMCA effects, fundamentals of
sulfur poisoning and anode degradation mechanisms, and thermo-
dynamic and kinetic driving forces for carbon deposition and cell
deactivation. It further discusses opportunities offered by recent ad-
vances and exciting developments in heterogeneous catalysis, such
as theoretical and computational tools for materials screening and
reaction pathways, doping and nanostructuring to modify surface
properties, exploiting strain effects for enhancing catalytic activi-
ty, as well as lowering the SOFC operating temperature for methane
conversion to overcome some of the materials challenges.

As the first logical step toward realizing natural gas conversion
the
in SOFCs, understanding the mechanistic details of
electrocatalytic oxidation reaction of methane is important, as SOFCs

offer many significant advantages including high conversion effi-
ciencies nearly two times that of current combustion-based power
generation technologies, capture-ready CO2 emission produced at
nearly one half the amount of current technologies, environmen-
tally friendly and quiet operation with no moving parts except in
the balance of plant. Furthermore, the cost-of-electricity (COE) es-
timates by the U.S. DOE also indicate that natural gas conversion
in SOFCs economically offers the most competitive option com-
pared with existing power generation technologies.

Experimental and theoretical studies on the catalysis of methane
oxidation indicate general agreement that activation of the first C—H
bond presents the highest barrier step followed by sequential ab-
straction of hydrogen. Ni and several precious metals are among the
best catalysts for methane activation to full oxidation. Pd sup-
ported on ceria with the general composition PdxCe1 − xO2 emerges

to be one of the most active catalysts for methane oxidation, but
the cost of Pd is an economic concern for practical applications. Partly
for economic reasons, abundance, and high catalytic activity, Ni has
traditionally been the most preferred and commonly used
electrocatalyst for SOFC anodes, albeit primarily for hydrogen ox-
idation. In methane environment, however, the propensity of Ni to
deactivate rapidly due both to sulfur poisoning and carbon depo-
sition presents serious challenges to employ it as an inexpensive
and highly effective electrocatalyst material for methane or natural
gas conversion on SOFC anodes.

The literature reports collectively suggest a critical sulfur content
that may be tolerable by a given electrocatalytic anode material. The
critical level also depends on the current density as well as oper-
ating temperature, where poisoning effect is aggravated at reduced
temperatures. Strategies have been devised to modify the

catalytic behavior of Ni and to improve its stability and tolerance
against sulfur and carbon. There has been much progress made in
materials development for mitigating the adverse impact of sulfur
and carbon, but most with limited success. The daunting task of
maximizing catalytic activity along with sufficient tolerance for sulfur
and carbon have led to attempts to compartmentalize these prob-
lems in order to devise appropriate solutions. For example, external
reforming followed by gas cleanup or internal reforming of desul-
furized natural gas has been pursued as alternative chemical steps
to supply sulfur-free syngas in place of methane to the Ni-based
anode surface. Alloying of Ni has been beneficial and provided better
tolerance, but still proved insufficient in most cases due to the strin-
gently low tolerance of Ni to sulfur, which seems to approach 1 ppm
H2S. This level is much below the typical levels of sulfurous odor-
ants such as mercaptans added to natural gas for ease of detection
by smell. Hence, there is great need for the development of sulfur
(and carbon) tolerant anode materials with catalytic activities com-
parable to or better than Ni.

For possible replacement of Ni, much attention has turned to MIEC
oxides as potential candidates. Indeed, many oxides particularly in
the doped-perovskite family have demonstrated greatly improved
stability and tolerance for sulfur and carbon, but they lack suffi-
cient catalytic activity for methane oxidation, and high electronic
conductivity or stability. Again, diverse and multi-prong strategies
have been employed for improving SOFC anode performance and
stability toward utilization and conversion of natural gas, which in-
herently contains varying amounts of sulfurous species. These wide
ranging strategies include alloying and coating (e.g., core-shell) of
Ni, exploiting metal–support interactions as well as lattice oxygen,
extrinsic doping of the host oxides especially the B-site of perovskites
for enhancing catalytic activity and stability, and exploring modern
design tools of nanostructuring and theoretical simulations for the
discovery and development of novel compositions or combina-
tions of materials structures. Many of these attempts have shown
limited success in bringing about significant mitigation of the two
primary difficulties posed by sulfur and carbon deactivation during
methane activation in SOFCs. Despite such limited success, several
notable examples with significant promise and successful results
include the use of Ni/BZCYYb cermet anodes in sulfurous environ-
ments up to 10% H2S, enhanced catalytic activity of ceria-based anode
materials, and improved tolerance by alloying and doping.

Recent advances in achieving direct electro-oxidation of methane
in SOFCs have demonstrated that pursuit of this approach has great
potential. It offers inherently higher efficiencies and reduced balance
of plant than reforming-based utilization of natural gas, and also
does not need a fuel processor. With the advent of advanced anodes
with high sulfur tolerance, the need for gas cleanup and desulfu-
rization may also be eliminated entirely. Although the current state-
of-the-art has not fully demonstrated practically applicable and long
lasting success stories yet, direct conversion still holds a great po-
tential for attractive and high-return benefits.

It is clear that SOFCs offer many important advantages for natural
gas conversion to electrical power. There are, however, serious sci-
entific challenges still remain to be overcome that require innovative
materials solutions before this promising technology can be con-
sidered for practical applications. This article presents an in-
depth discussion of these challenges and points to emerging
opportunities to expand the materials discovery space to develop
novel and superior electrolcatalysts.
