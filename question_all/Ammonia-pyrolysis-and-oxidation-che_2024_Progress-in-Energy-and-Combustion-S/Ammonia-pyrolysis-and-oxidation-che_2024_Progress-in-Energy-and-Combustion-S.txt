Ammonia has been essential to human activities for centuries. It is widely used as feedstock for fertilizers, in-
dustrial chemicals, and emission after-treatment systems. Owing to its properties, ammonia has garnered interest
as a carrier for hydrogen in energy applications. It can be generated from carbon-free emission sources and
pyrolyzed to produce pure hydrogen for various applications. The combustion of ammonia for power generation
has been previously reviewed in this journal besides several aspects of ammonia oxidation chemistry, as it relates
to emission after-treatment and reburn systems. However, the pyrolysis and oxidation chemistry of ammonia
requires further elucidation to improve its use as a hydrogen carrier and as a fuel for combustion systems. This
article provides an in-depth review of ammonia pyrolysis and oxidation chemistry in noncatalytic and catalytic
systems. The catalytic pyrolysis chemistry of ammonia to produce pure hydrogen is reviewed to understand
catalyst and reactor requirements for scaling up this technology. The combustion properties of ammonia as a
pure fuel and in mixtures, including ignition, flame propagation, and extinction characteristics; its pyrolysis and
oxidation reactions; and its potential to produce pollutant emissions are extensively reviewed. Ammonia com-
bustion reaction mechanisms are reported based on results from pyrolysis and oxidation reactors, shock tubes,
rapid compression machines, and research engines. The experimental work is complemented by the development
of detailed combustion models via chemical kinetic and quantum chemistry simulations. Herein, recent results on
ammonia pyrolysis and oxidation chemistry are introduced and summarized by highlighting the pertinent as-
pects of this rich and rapidly increasing body of information.

1. Introduction and background

The history of ammonia on Earth spans billions of years. This simple
molecule has played a significant role in the planetâs evolution, as
argued by Oparin in his 1938 book, The Origin of Life [1]. Ammonia was
formed in the early Earthâs atmosphere due to geological activity that
caused nitrogen gas to react with hydrogen-rich compounds. Ammonia,
along with molecules such as water, methane, and carbon dioxide, were
present in pre-biotic Earth and formed the building blocks of life [2]. As
the Earth cooled over time and the atmosphere stabilized, ammonia
served as a reactant and/or a catalyst in the formation of complex
organic molecules with carbonânitrogen bonds (e.g., amino acids and
proteins). While the details of life-forming mechanisms have been
widely scrutinized in the research community [3], the significant role of
ammonia in the early Earth system has been generally accepted [4].

Ammonia is presently a crucial component of the nitrogen cycle,
transforming nitrogen into different chemical forms. Nitrogen fixation is

crucial for the growth of plants and micro-organisms; this process is
naturally driven and converts atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia [5].
Naturally occurring ammonia is currently negligible compared to
man-made ammonia, as industrial ammonia production is the corner-
stone of modern agriculture [6,7]. The HaberâBosch process was
invented in 1908 [8] for food and military security (ammonia is also
used to produce nitrogen-containing explosives); it converts atmo-
spheric nitrogen and hydrogen from natural gas in high-pressure cata-
lytic reactors and has transformed the world [9].

The use of ammonia as a fuel has garnered considerable interest [10].
Affordable and readily available fuels are pivotal for transportation,
industrial operations, and residential needs. Limited accessibility to fuel
sources can bring the majority of global economy to a standstill and
cause geopolitical instability. However, atmospheric greenhouse gases
and pollutants are emitted due to the combustion of carbon-based fuels
derived from fossil sources, causing environmental and human health
impacts.

Hydrogen is a renewable fuel generated from sources such as solar
and wind energy. However, hydrogen transportation is complex owing
to its low energy density. Ammonia is an emerging, promising renew-
able energy carrier owing to its high energy density as a liquid under
moderate pressures and room temperatures. Ammonia can be com-
busted in furnaces, boilers, and engines or can be cracked into hydrogen
for use in fuel cells. However, its widespread use as a fuel is challenging.
Several studies have, in recent years, explored the potential of ammonia
as an energy vector, including comprehensive overviews by Valera-
Medina et al. [11â13], Kobayashi et al. [14], Mathieu and Petersen
[15]. Other reviews focused on ammonia synthesis [16]; its use for NOx
catalytic removal [17]; and its application in practical devices such as
turbines, piston engines, and furnaces [18â21].

Ammonia cracking (pyrolysis) and combustion are posed with
challenges, which will be investigated from a chemistry perspective
herein. Moreover, studies on the pyrolysis of noncatalytic and catalytic
pyrolysis of ammonia (Section 2) and ammonia combustion will be
comprehensively analyzed both experimentally (Section 3) and theo-
retically (Section 4) to contribute to the development a renewable fuel
or energy vector, thereby supporting the worldâs energy demand (see
Fig. 1). Ultimately, this review outlines challenges and prospects for
essential research (Section 5) that should enable the effective utilization
of ammonia in real-world systems.

2. Ammonia pyrolysis

2.1. Non-catalytic thermal pyrolysis

Pyrolysis is a process, using which materials or chemical species are
thermally degraded in an inert atmosphere. A catalyst is used to enhance
degradation in catalytic pyrolysis, whereas degradation is facilitated
only by high temperatures in thermal pyrolysis. Pyrolysis can generally
be used in numerous applications such as waste treatment [22] and
production of valuable products such as petrochemical products [23,
24]. Due to the growing interest in the production of renewable
hydrogen as a clean fuel without CO2 and NOx emissions, special
attention has been paid to the production of fuels from biomass [25] and
hydrogen from ammonia. This section reviews different noncatalytic
pyrolytic processes of ammonia for hydrogen production along with
their performance, advantages, and disadvantages.

2.1.1. Experiments and modeling of membrane pyrolysis reactors

Fixed-bed membrane reactors (FBMRs) for the decomposition of
ammonia into nitrogen and hydrogen have garnered considerable
research interest owing to their higher efficiency compared with fixed-
bed reactors (FBRs), as confirmed via numerical simulations. These
simulations also highlighted the role of membranes in enhancing
ammonia conversion by displacing the thermodynamic equilibrium
[26]. However, these membranes decrease the temperature along the
length of the reactor, negatively impacting the kinetics and possibly
limiting hydrogen yield improvements [26]. Moreover, a cascade of four
multistage fixed-bed membrane reactors (MSFBMRs) with inter-stage
heating and fresh sweep gas could achieve 100 % ammonia conver-
sion and produce high-quality hydrogen suitable for proton exchange
(PEM) fuel cells. The number of beds and feed temperature for ammonia
conversion have a linear relation. Thus, the multistage configuration of
FBMRs is a promising setup for ultra-clean hydrogen production from
ammonia pyrolysis. 100 % ammonia conversion was achieved using a
total of seven multistage beds [27]. Numerical investigations of the ef-
fect of ammonia feed distribution along the height of an FBMR showed
that an equal distribution of injection can improve hydrogen production
rate at 800 K by 17.45 % than that without feed distribution [28].
Furthermore, the conversion of ammonia is sensitive to the number of
distribution points, and the reactor length can be reduced by 75.0 % by
finding an optimal number of distribution points without affecting the
hydrogen yield.

Process simulations of ammonia decomposition in FBRs and FBMRs
have shown that higher ammonia conversions and hydrogen yields are
potentially obtained in membrane reactors at lower operating temper-
(cid:0) 1 enhances ammonia
atures [29]. He sweep gas flow of up to 5 kmol h
conversion in FBMRs and higher H2 permeance positively impacts the
hydrogen yield, further facilitating the use of lower operating temper-
atures and opening new research prospects based on the design of new
membranes with higher permeance [29].

â¦

The use of membranes for ammonia decomposition has been proven
useful
in plasma reactors. The hydrogen conversion rate in an
atmospheric-pressure plasma membrane reactor (PMR) reached 24.4 %,
two-fold that in typical plasma reactors [30]. Fig. 2 shows the hydrogen
production mechanism, wherein ammonia is first decomposed into H
radicals that are adsorbed on the membrane surface and penetrated to
finally recombine for yielding H2 [30]. Another PMR [30] obtained a
stable 20.0 ml/min flow of high-purity hydrogen with a power con-
sumption of 400 W at â¤400
C. Yue et al. [31], instead of testing the
membrane performance in their plasma reactor, investigated the effect
of the plasma discharge mode, i.e., dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) or
alternating current (AC) arc discharge, on ammonia decomposition at
atmospheric pressure. They reported different ammonia dissociation
mechanisms for the DBD and AC modes. The DBD mode mainly induced
an electronic excitation of ammonia molecules that later dissociated via
NâH scission due to collisions with high-energy electrons, whereas the
AC mode directly dissociated ammonia molecules to form NH2 and NH
species. Based on the higher efficiency of the AC arc discharge mode,
they further tested different AC arc discharge reactor structures and
concluded that the tubeâtube AC arc discharge structure is highly effi-
cient and achieved 60 % ammonia conversion with an energy input of
30 W. DBD plasma is also suitable for ammonia decomposition because
the electric load to the plasma reactor can be easily controlled by
adjusting its output voltage [32].

2.1.2. Ammonia pyrolysis in membrane-free reactors

Ammonia pyrolysis has been investigated under flow reactor con-
ditions without using membranes. Ben Ìes et al. recently conducted ex-
periments in a quartz tubular flow reactor and in a non-porous alumina
tubular flow reactor at 900â1500 K and 900â1800 K, respectively, using
Ar and N2 as bath gases [33]. Fig. 3 shows the experiemntal set up,
wherein gases are supplied through mass flow controllers and reactants
are premixed before entering the reactor inlet. They observed that

regardless of the operating conditions, pyrolysis was initiated at 1173 K.
Moreover, at temperatures below 1400 K, the use of various reactors
does not affect ammonia pyrolysis because no surface effects are
observed at such temperatures. Similarly, bath gas did not influence
ammonia conversion, and similar results were obtained for 1000 and
10000 ppm inlet concentrations of ammonia. The residence time posi-
tively affected ammonia conversion, and 100 % ammonia conversion
was observed in the nonporous alumina tubular flow reactor at 1700 K
regardless of the gas residence time. Dirtu et al. performed ammonia
thermal decomposition in a quartz reactor under dynamic conditions at
1073 K [34]. They confirmed the formation of hydrazine as an inter-
mediate in ammonia pyrolysis and suggested an alternative route for
hydrazine synthesis via ammonia pyrolysis at 1073 K and an ammonia
flow rate of 580 cm3 min

(cid:0) 1 as optimal conditions.
Ammonia decomposition in an ammonia-fueled microchannel
reactor was studied via simulation using a multiphysics model
comprising continuity equations for momentum, mass, and energy and
without detailed chemical reactions. Results improved the understand-
ing of transport phenomena and gas-surface interactions within the
microchannel reactor [35]. Ammonia conversion could reach as high as
(cid:0) 1. A thicker
(cid:0) 1h
99.1 % at 973 K, with a space velocity of 65000 Nmlgcat
porous wash coat layer potentially increases ammonia conversion but
also causes higher pressure drops. An optimal microchannel reactor with

Alturaifi et al. studied ammonia pyrolysis and the importance of
pyrolysis reactions in high-temperature oxidation via a shock tube (ST)
and modeling study [36]. Ammonia consumption profiles were obtained
using laser absorption diagnostic at high temperatures of 2100â3000 K
near atmospheric pressure in 0.5 % NH3âAr and 0.42 NH3/2 % H2âAr
mixtures. The as-obtained results were combined with other pyrolysis
data from the literature to devise a new ammonia pyrolysis mechanism.
Their mechanism, containing 13 species and 48 reactions, reproduced
the experimental results; their approach was thus used to update
ammonia oxidation mechanisms [36]. The updated kinetic models

Moreover, kinetic models for ammonia decomposition in more

ammonia into hydrogen in the presence of H2S and CO2, i.e., for
ammonia contaminated with acid gas [37]. The model [37] was vali-

Contrarily, H2S hindered ammonia conversion and increased the tem-
perature threshold. Reactor temperatures above 1600 K and initial
concentrations of ammonia up to 20 % in acid gas also increased H2
yield [37].

Given the importance of ammonia pyrolysis, alternative ammonia
crackers were recently reported. Alboshmina et al. designed and built a
cracker system for enhancing the efficiency of ammonia combustion by
partially cracking ammonia into a mixture of hydrogen and nitrogen
[38]. A hemispherical tipped bluff-body configuration was found in the
center of a swirl combustor, which enhanced flame retention, generated
larger recirculation zones for increased residence time, and controlled
NOx emissions, enabling efficient ammonia combustion.

2.1.3. Toward the commercialization of non-catalytic ammonia pyrolysis
The aforementioned studies on ammonia pyrolysis highlighted the
role of ammonia as a hydrogen carrier. In particular, ammonia produced
from renewable energy will highly likely play a pivotal role in the

hydrogen economy currently under development by many nations to
reduce carbon emissions and increase energy security. Thus, tech-
noeconomic analyses and patents targeting more commercial and
practical applications of hydrogen production via ammonia pyrolysis
are underway.

Makhloufi and Kezibri recently demonstrated that the large-scale
production of pure H2 from ammonia is feasible by designing an
ammonia-to-H2 plant that operates at a thermal efficiency of 68.5 % and
produces 200 MTPD of pure hydrogen at 250 bar [39]. Fig. 4a shows the
layout of their designed ammonia cracker, with a firebox where heat is
provided to promote decomposition in cracker tubes. The corresponding
AspenPlus model shown in Fig. 4b was used to assess the overall energy
performance and specific energy consumption. The Rankine cycle was
used to generate 15 MW of electricity via the recovery of heat mainly
consumed by the downstream compressors. Furthermore, the final
hydrogen cost is mostly dependent on the cost of ammonia determined
based on the cost of the renewable electricity used for its generation.

Numerous patents have been registered for devices that convert
gaseous or liquid ammonia into H2 for energy applications in advance of
the hydrogen economy concept that has gained popularity in recent
years. This is indicative of the attention ammonia pyrolysis for H2
generation has drawn for many years.

The most common patents are perhaps those in which ammonia,
supplied either as gas or liquid, is cracked by thermal energy. Zheng
et al. patented a device that gasified and cracked liquid ammonia at high
temperatures more efficiently than other devices because of its simpler
and compact scattered beam-type structure [40]. Yoshiro developed a
device, using which the ammonia gas generated after vaporization was
heated and pyrolyzed by combusting another fuel gas to reduce H2
production costs, as opposed to former devices that used expensive
metal hydrides as vaporizers [41]. Similarly, the cracking furnace
patented by Chen and Hou was connected with an oil pump; thus, its
environmental impact would be determined based on the nature or
source of oil [42]. However, more environmentally friendly alternatives

have been invented [43â46], in which the H2 generated from ammonia
was combusted to pre-heat more amounts of ammonia and facilitate its
decomposition. Additionally, radioisotope plutonium-238 was used for
efficiently heating and decomposing ammonia without CO2 emissions,
albeit with nuclear safety concerns [47]. Renam Properties patented a
liquid ammonia storage vessel that vaporized and converted ammonia
into H2 and N2 for an offshore platform that is supplied with liquid
ammonia from a ship. The generated H2 was used to produce electricity
that is supplied onshore via an electrical cable [48].

Another device for liquid ammonia pyrolysis focused on improving
the decomposition furnace, which is a critical part in those devices, was
patented [49]. The main features of this furnace were a hydrogen outlet
pipe installed on the upper part, a cooling box installed on the hydrogen
outlet pipe, and a circulating water inlet pipe installed on the cooling
box. These features reduced the pyrolysis temperatures and saved water.
Hongchao et al. focused on improving the efficiency of their device by
exploiting thermal energy of the high-temperature decomposition gas
emitted from the decomposition furnace. They highlighted the impor-
tance of ammonia pyrolysis in such processes [50]. Finally, a pioneering
patent by Absell in 1959 pointed out that combining hydrogen separa-
tion and ammonia vaporization is advantageous for heat economy [51].
Accordingly, in their invention, the vaporizing ammonia possibly cooled
down the H2âN2 mixture generated due to ammonia pyrolysis before the
mixture entered the bed of molecular sieves for its separation. Hot gases
emitted from the cracker heated up the gaseous ammonia that entered
the cracker [51].

In many of these patents, the inventors used the heat released during
H2 combustion or designed a more efficient setup for ammonia cracker
and combustion device to facilitate efficient ammonia pyrolysis and
reduce costs. To this end, nitrogen gas generated during ammonia py-
rolysis was also used for blanketing compressors, operating valves, and
drying nozzles, thereby preventing the use of external nitrogen sources
[52]. The use of solar energy has also been tested in ammonia pyrolysis
devices. Solar energy fuses a salt that heats the ammonia gas being

been proposed for ammonia cracking in a fuel-cell vehicle [55].

Plasma reactors have also been proposed as ammonia crackers for H2
production. For example, dielectric discharge plasma reactors using
high-voltage electrodes or microwave generators for ammonia cracking

have been patented [56,57]. However, plasma technologies are still
expensive and need further optimization to become competitive and
efficient. Table 1 summarizes the patents on ammonia thermal
decomposition.

2.2. Catalytic ammonia decomposition

The immaturity and low efficiency of large-scale ammonia cracking
into hydrogen are crucial limitations of using ammonia as an energy
carrier, which can be addressed via the catalytic cracking of ammonia.
To date, thermocatalytic ammonia decomposition reactor that use Co- or
Ni-based catalysts is the only combination suitable for large-scale
applications.

The direct use of ammonia as fuel for power generation is discussed
in subsequent sections; therefore, this section deals with the challenges
involved in identifying catalytic materials and reactor types for catalytic
ammonia decomposition for large-scale industrial processes. Chemic
kinetics and fluid dynamic modeling are also discussed to improve the
performance and optimize the design of reactors.

2.2.1. Catalyst requirements and development using a rational design

The requirements of catalysts for ammonia decomposition in
industrial-scale applications and challenges involved in identifying
optimal catalysts from the literature are highlighted in this section [58].
Develop a robust ammonia decomposition catalyst that is highly effi-
cient, scalable, and economical is a significant challenge in ammonia
decomposition [59,60]. The decomposition efficiency can be improved
by developing highly active catalysts at low temperatures and high
pressures, as hydrogen post-compression is an energy-intensive process
[61â64]. Various catalysts such as monometallic, multimetallic or al-
loys, nitride or carbide, and metal amide/imide catalysts and their
performance must be compared to identify an ideal catalyst for the
process. In doing so, significant discrepancies in testing procedures,
materials preparation, and reactivity results must be taken into account
[65].

These aforementioned catalysts can be prepared using different
supports, and promoters can be added to increase their catalytic activ-
ities. Understanding the effects of catalyst components on their catalytic
activity and their relation provides insight into the design of advanced
catalysts. This section overviews the designing of catalysts using
advanced supports and promoters. Using supports with a high surface
area, high thermal stability, strong metalâsupport interaction, high ba-
sicity and conductivity, and low concentration of electron-withdrawing
groups can improve the catalytic activity. The support affects the par-
ticle size, dispersion, morphologies, and electronic structures of

supported metals. The addition of structural and electronic promoters
also enhances the catalytic activity.

Reaction mechanisms provide useful guidelines for catalyst design.
Ammonia decomposition proceeds via stepwise dehydrogenation, fol-
lowed by the recombination of two N or H atoms to form N2 and H2,
respectively. The binding energy of N on a metal surface is a good
descriptor of ammonia decomposition rates [66]. Consequently, the
nitrogen binding energy of different monometallic and bimetallic sys-
tems is generally used as guideline for the rational design of novel cat-
alysts [67,68]. The binding energy of the nitrogen atom on the surface
must be sufficiently strong for initiating NHx dehydrogenation and
sufficiently weak such that nitrogen recombines and desorbs from the
surface, thereby completing the catalytic cycle [60].

Ruthenium (Ru) shows a volcano-type relation between the nitrogen
binding energy and ammonia decomposition activity, with the highest
decomposition rates and the lowest operating temperature [70â76].
Ru-based catalysts are therefore most widely investigated [54,69]. An
optimal Ru catalyst is prepared by doping potassium on the Ru support
on MgO or carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The catalytic properties of Ru can
be tuned using different supports (MgO or La2O3 [72,77,78], CNT [79,
80], or Al2O3, [70,71,74,81]), which increase metal dispersion and
particle size [82]. MgO promotes metalâsupport interactions and en-
hances the electronic properties of Ru because it is an electron donor.
Conductive carbon-based supports with electron-donating species can
provide electronic density to metal nanoparticles (NPs). Alkali pro-
moters have multiple roles, such as controlling the NP size, increasing
basicity to the support, favoring the associative desorption of nitrogen
atoms, modifying the electronic properties of Ru particles, and
decreasing the activation energy of the reaction [83,84]. The promo-
tional effect of alkali metals is of this order: KâRu > NaâRu > LiâRu >
CeâRu > BaâRu > LaâRu > CaâRu > Ru. This suggests that the catalytic
activity increases with increasing electronegativity of promoter decays.
The basicity and conductivity of supports are crucial for designing a
highly efficient ammonia-decomposition catalyst (Fig. 5).

Although the best catalytic systems for ammonia decomposition are
based on Ru, their large-scale use is not feasible due to high costs and the
scarcity of Ru [85â88]. To use ammonia for hydrogen production in
large-scale industrial applications, a new generation of catalysts based
on non-noble metals (mainly Ni, Fe, and Co) must be developed [78,83].
Transition metals show good catalytic activity at high temperatures
(>600
C) [89]; therefore, their performance and stability must be
improved to expand their applicability [58,85,88,90].

â¦

Cobalt offers advantages compared to iron or nickel. It is the most
active transition metal for ammonia decomposition, particularly at low
reaction temperatures [67,68,91], due to its weaker nitrogen binding
energy that results in lower activation energy [87]. Metallic cobalt is
widely used as the active cobalt phase for ammonia decomposition [87,
88]. Cobalt is affected by the physical and chemical properties of the

support (e.g., basicity and electron conductivity) and promoters
[92â98]. Similarly, the preparation method and pre-treatment condi-
tions are critical parameters for catalyst properties and catalytic activity
[99]. The use of high-surface-area supports and the addition of an alkali
or alkaline earth promoters have resulted in higher metal dispersions
[92,93,100,101]. Carbon supports with a good metalâsupport interac-
tion with cobalt improved the electron transfer and reduced the nitrogen
desorption energy, thereby increasing the catalytic activity [102â106].
Nickel catalysts are also used commercially for ammonia cracking.
Nickel supported on alumina has garnered attention owing to its supe-
rior mechanical properties and heat resistance [82]. Together with Fe
and Co, the catalytic activity of Ni can be enhanced using ceramic ma-
terials as supports of 2â4 nm. Although current studies focus on the
high-temperature catalytic activity of these systems, they show potential
for low-temperature decomposition of ammonia, probably using similar
promotion strategies as Ru-based catalysts [61].

Although Fe is cheaper, Fe-based catalysts are generally less active
than Co or Ni due to their high nitrogen binding energy. Many Fe-
supported catalysts have been reported in the literature [77,92,98,
107â112], including iron/carbon materials [78,88,102,113â119]. The
use of carbon supports with a good metalâsupport interaction can
improve the electron transfer properties and enhance the catalytic ac-
tivity [106,120,121]. These properties can be further enhanced by
improving particle size and metal dispersion using promoters.

Theoretical models using the surface N-binding energy as a
descriptor for decomposition rates predict that bimetallic transition

metal NPs are cost-effective candidates to substitute expensive Ru cat-
alysts [67,68,87,122,123]. Several bimetallic combinations have been
tested, including FeâCo NPs on carbon nanotubes, MoâNi on Al2O3, and
FeâNi on Al2O3 [60], and CoâMo [61]. The incorporation of Co enriches
the electron density of Ru species and decreases the particle size of NPs.
High-efficiency high-entropy alloys (HEA CoMoFeNiCu NPs) have
enhanced catalytic activity and stability [124]. When using bimetallic
catalysts, their structural stability is vital because weak metalâsupport
interactions cause metal segregation [61,90]. Moreover, carbides and
nitrides of transition metals [60], sodium amide, and lithium imide are
used as alternatives to Ru [61]. However, they suffer from poor stability
under reaction conditions.

Choosing an ideal catalyst for industrial applications is difficult
because most catalytic materials have only been explored in lab-scale
experiments. Moreover, the wide range of catalytic testing and data
analysis approaches complicate the reliable estimation of the suitability
of these catalysts in industrial processes [58,65]. However, some cata-
lysts yield promising catalytic activity, such as Co and Ni, at
500

C and are therefore suitable for large-scale applications.

2.2.2. Types of reactors: advantages and drawbacks

In addition to synthesizing an efficient catalyst, a suitable reactor is
essential for ammonia decomposition [87], as the performance of het-
erogeneous catalysts depends also on the type of reactor used. Therefore,
different reactors and technologies to supply heat for decomposition are
being currently studied.

Thermal catalytic cracking is the most developed process for
hydrogen production from ammonia [123]. Bulky reactors employ
industrially renowned technologies mainly for annealing, galvanizing,
and nitriding in the metallurgical industry. Medium to large-scale
ammonia crackers (sizes of 10â300 kg per day of hydrogen), use
external energy sources such as nickel supported on aluminum oxide as a
â¦
catalyst and operate at ~850â950
C [58]. Conventional packed-bed
reactors suffer from poor efficiency and mechanical and thermal limi-
tations for large reactor volumes [60].

The development of small-scale ammonia crackers is underway, and
it will enable decentralized and mobile applications, e.g., supplying
hydrogen produced by ammonia cracking to 5â10-kW fuel cells.
Microstructured reactors with high surface area/volume ratios offer
high heat and mass transfer, easy separation, robustness, and minimize
H2 inhibition, thereby enhancing conversion efficiency (Fig. 6) [87,
125]. However, their durability and robustness under dynamic condi-
tions in realistic operations must be investigated, such as frequent
start-up and shutdown cycles. Microreactors with graphite-coated silica,
silicon carbide, or alumina have shown higher activity per reactor vol-
ume than conventional reactors [125,126]; however, they suffered from

poor catalyst regeneration and recovery. Other structured reactors,
microfibers, monoliths, and foams show better performance due to more
uniform flow distribution and the absence of backmixing. Microfibrous
entrapped Ni/CeO2âAl2O3 composites showed nine-fold reduction in
catalyst dosage and 10
C temperature reduction than packed-bed re-
actors. Microchannel reactors have even smaller vol/wt than monolithic
reactors and can be easily scaled-up [127]. Microchannel catalytic re-
actors allow coupling endothermic ammonia decomposition reaction
with an exothermic reaction occurring in adjacent countercurrent
channels, thereby enhancing the overall thermal efficiency. Micro-
structured and microchannel reactors are at a more advanced develop-
ment phase than membrane reactors [74,128].

Reactors with H2-selective membranes integrate catalytic reaction
and hydrogen purification in a single unit, thereby lowering the instal-
lation and operation costs (Fig. 7) [130â133]. Hydrogen removal
through Pd-based membranes can shift thermodynamic equilibrium and
enhance the reaction kinetics, thereby increasing ammonia conversion
and facilitating reaction at lower temperatures [74,134]. However,
Pd-based membranes are costly and have poor membrane durability
[132], and they require significant improvements before large-scale
implementation. Recently, alloy-based membranes, Pd double-skinned
membranes, or Pd-coated V membranes [135] with a porous layer
have been developed with optimal surface protection as well as
outstanding H2-permeance selectivity and stability. High-performance
stainless-steel-supported Pd composite membranes with finger-like gap

structure showed robustness under rapid heating/cooling cycles [136].
Silica-based ceramics [137], porous stainless-steel, Ni alloys, NiâNbâZr
composite alloys, and Pd-coated V, Nb, and Ta are few alternatives to
expensive Pd-based membranes [74]. However, their limitations in
selectivity and permeability affect H2 productivity and purity.

To improve the efficiency of conventional

thermal ammonia
crackers, energy supply methods are used for initiating endothermic
catalytic reactions such as ammonia decomposition using microwave,
plasma, electric current, solar energy, and ammonia electrolysis. How-
ever, these methods are in their early development stages and have not
been applied on large industrial scales. Moreover, they cannot easily be
incorporated into existing engineering systems, which is a major
drawback, as replacing conventional systems would require significant
investment.

Microwaves can reach desired temperatures faster and transfer en-
ergy directly to the catalysts (Fig. 8), thereby dramatically increasing
ammonia conversion at very low temperatures than conventionally
heated reactors [139,140]. The heat transfer distribution in an atmo-
spheric pressure dielectric barrier discharge plasma reactor has been
demonstrated and investigated on a laboratory scale (Fig. 9) [141].
Simulation studies described a reactor for ammonia cracking and
simultaneous hydrogen purification through H2-selective membranes,
where the heat for the reaction was provided by solar energy using
mirrors to obtain a single focal point.

Ammonia electrolysis (decomposition by an electric current), as
alternative to thermal decomposition of ammonia, might be useful for
distributed hydrogen production in the future [74,128]; however, NH3
electrolyzers at present cannot operate at the required current densities
without deactivation. Other technologies such as hybrid thermal-
âelectrochemical cells produce high-purity hydrogen via thermal-
âelectrochemical decomposition; however, their rates are still

2.2.3. Mechanism and kinetics of ammonia decomposition reaction

Ammonia decomposition mechanisms are strongly dependent on the
catalytic system, operating conditions, and reactor design, which affect
different elementary steps. Therefore, the reaction kinetics used for
describing this process is complex, and various factors are considered for
identifying the rate-determining step (RDS).

Catalytic ammonia decomposition (2NH3âN2+3H2) proceeds via
ammonia chemisorption on the catalyst surface, followed by stepwise
dehydrogenation. recombination of two N or two H to form N2 and H2,
respectively, and the desorption of reaction products, as shown in the
following sequence of elementary reactions.

(i) NH3 â NH3*
(ii) NH3* â NH2* + H*
(iii) NH2* â NH* + H*
(iv) NH* â N* + H*
(v) 2N* â N2 + 2*
(vi) 2H* â H2 + 2*

Kinetic expressions have been proposed to describe reaction rates
based on different RDSs assuming a reaction mechanism. The commonly
considered RDSs for this process are i) nitrogen desorption and ii) the
dissociation of adsorbed NH3 with NâH bond scission. Normally, at low
temperatures (<400
C), where nitrogen desorption is the slowest step,
the kinetics are dependent on the partial pressures of hydrogen and
ammonia based on the TemkinâPyzhev model. At T > 500
C, the NâH
bond scission slows down due to increased hydrogen partial pressure
that inhibits the reaction. These two phenomena are described by the

assumes
coverage-independent parameters. Recent models consider the inhibi-
tion of reaction rates by hydrogen coverage, particularly at low tem-
peratures. Kinetics models with more than one RDS or those wherein the
limiting step shifts with temperature variations have also been reported
[58]. Armenise et al. has described catalytic ammonia decomposition
kinetics in detail [143].

The RDS can vary depending on the following factors.

1) Catalyst types: Different catalysts (metals, supports, promoters, and
active site architectures) influence the RDS. For example, nitrogen
desorption is common for noble metals, whereas dehydrogenation
steps are assumed to be the RDS for transition catalysts.

2) Operating conditions: The RDS can change with temperature or
pressure variations. For example, on Fe active sites, nitrogen
desorption dominates at low temperatures, whereas dehydrogena-
tion becomes critical at higher temperatures.

3) Catalytic reactor: The design and configuration of reactors pose heat
and mass diffusional restrictions, which may control the reaction rate
and RDS. Moreover, H2-selective membranes are introduced to pre-
vent hydrogen inhibition.

Lucentini et al. reviewed the kinetics and reaction mechanisms of
ammonia decomposition on different metal catalysts [58]. They
compared the kinetics of different catalytic systems based on metals
such as Ru, Ni, Co, and Fe and their composites, including the limiting
reactions and apparent activation energies. Multiple RDSs and activa-
tion energies were observed for most catalysts. This highlights the
complexity of underlying reaction mechanisms that depend on the
catalyst composition and the particle size and content of metals, nature
of the support, synthesis method, promoters, and reaction conditions or
reactor configuration.

For Ru-based catalysts containing metal particles of different sizes,
nitrogen recombination is the RDS. Moreover, the apparent activation
energy changes with the particle size [144]. However, the RDS varies
across different supports [145]. For Co-, Ni-, and Fe-based catalysts, the
RDS and apparent activation energy change with their particle size,
support, and reaction temperatures [146â148]. Bimetallic systems often
enhance the catalytic activity by decreasing the activation energy and
altering the RDS. For Fe-based catalysts, ammonia adsorption is the RDS,
whereas for Co-based catalysts, both NâH bond cleavage and N2
desorption are the RDSs. For CoâFe bimetallic catalysts, nitrogen
desorption from the catalyst surface was deemed the RDS [149].

Understanding ammonia decomposition mechanism is crucial for
designing more effective catalysts for this reaction. Considering that
nitrogen desorption and dehydrogenation of NH3 are the most common
RDSs, catalytic activity can be enhanced by increasing the number of
active sites and basicity. In addition, a high metal dispersion will in-
crease the number of active sites, thereby increasing the possibility of
recombination for the adsorbed nitrogen and its desorption from the
catalytic surface. Therefore, tailoring the catalyst properties (i.e.,
metals, active site structures, supports, particle sizes, and promoters)
will promote the RDS and considerably improve the overall reaction
rate.

Experimental and modeling approaches have been combined for
developing an efficient process for the catalytic decomposition of
ammonia. For example, ab initio microkinetic modeling strategy was
used to determine the RDS [150], which combined ab initio calculations,
lab-scale experiments, and appropriate reactor modeling to elucidate
NH3 decomposition kinetics. The approach allowed distinguishing the
RDS accurately and highlighted the role of alkali promotion, revealing
that the addition of alkali metals modified the catalytic surface, selec-
tively promoted N2 desorption, and altered the RDS.

Simulation studies primarily focus on developing a reliable kinetic
model to predict the performance of reactors under relevant reaction

A parameter estimation problem can be applied to determine the
kinetic parameters of the rate expression by fitting the experimental
results to different kinetic expressions. These expressions are obtained
by assuming alternatively each elementary step of the reaction as the
RDS while considering all the other steps in equilibrium (quasi-equi-
librium approach). The rate expression that best fits the experimental
results provides information about the reaction mechanism for a
particular catalytic system.

Although kinetic analyses conducted using global rate expressions
can reveal kinetically relevant steps, they can yield inaccurate conclu-
sions considering the broad assumptions involved. Such inaccuracies
can be prevented by combining the experiments with thermodynamic
constraints on the overall reaction cycle [151]. Microkinetic models are
fitted with enthalpyâentropy constraints for parameters such as
pre-exponential factors, activation energies, and sticking coefficients to
understand the reaction mechanism of a catalytic system. For example,
in alkali-promoted catalysts, N2 desorption and NH2 dehydrogenation
are kinetically relevant steps. The approach clarifies the effect of pro-
moter alkalinity on the kinetics of specific elementary steps and en-
hances the conversions, as observed experimentally [151].

Furthermore, the rate expression can be used for modeling the pro-
cess and designing reactors. Reactor designs (fired cracker, membrane,
or microchannel reactors), catalyst placement in the reactor, and
optimal operating conditions are crucial for developing an efficient H2
production technology that minimizes cost and manages heat transfer.
Understanding the influence of the main operating parameters via
computer simulations will increase the certainty of scaling up reactor
design and construction [152]. Such simulations offer an inexpensive
and less physically intensive tool compared to large-scale experimental
studies. Such reactor simulations commonly assume laminar flow, ideal
gas behavior, no reaction in the bulk gas phase, negligible pressure drop
in the reactor, catalyst layer as an isotropic porous medium, and thermal
equilibrium achieved between gas mixtures and catalysts [152].

2.2.4. Potential for scale-up and applications

A large facility for catalytic ammonia cracking is under construction
in Rotterdam [153]. In this initiative, 18 companies have kicked off a
study on a large-scale ammonia cracker (1 million tons of hydrogen per
year) to analyze the possibilities for a central cracking facility to convert
imported ammonia back to hydrogen. The generated hydrogen will be
transported onward via pipelines to facilitate decarbonization in the
North-West Europe. In South Korea, Johnson Matthey and Doosan
Enerbility will work together to integrate cracking and closed-cycle
hydrogen turbine power plants [154]. Johnson Matthey will provide
cracking technology and catalysts to convert ammonia into pure
hydrogen fuel, whereas Doosan will develop a 380-MW, hydrogen-fed
turbine by 2027. In the UK, Siemens Energy, Fortescue Future In-
dustries, and GeoPura are developing a Â£3.5 million ammonia cracker
prototype that will deliver 200 kg of high-purity PEM-suitable hydrogen
fuel per day based on Fortescueâs âMetal Membrane Technologyâ puri-
fication process [155].

3. Fundamental combustion chemistry experiments

Ammonia oxidation is an alternative to endothermic pyrolysis (i.e.,
cracking) and allows releasing the maximum calorific value of fuels as
energy during combustion. The challenges associated with ammonia
combustion [11â15] include low laminar burning velocity, poor ignit-
ability and flame stability, and potentially high harmful emissions.
These challenges can be mitigated with a more comprehensive under-
standing of the combustion chemistry of ammonia.

By comparing numerically predicted combustion properties with
those determined via fundamental combustion experiments, the chem-
ical kinetic models developed for ammonia combustion can be vali-
dated. We focus on comparing the combustion properties of ammonia
with those derived via numerical simulations in zero-dimensional
transient systems (initial value problem) or one-dimensional steady
systems
(boundary value problem). For validation with zero-
dimensional transient numerical simulations, ignition delay times and
species time histories during ignition were measured using STs [156,
157] and rapid compression machines (RCMs) [158,159]. Speciation
data at a given temperature and residence time were measured in
jet-stirred reactors (JSRs) [160] and plug flow reactors (PFRs) [161,
162]. For validation with one-dimensional steady simulations, laminar
flame speeds (âlaminar burning velocityâ) were measured using several
experimental methods [163,164]. Constant-volume chambers (CVCs)
with constant-pressure spherically propagating flames and heat flux
burners (HFBs) with steady flat flames are widely used to measure
laminar flame speeds. Counterflow burners (CFBs) are used to determine
the extinction limits of premixed and non-premixed laminar flames.
Flat-flame burners (FFBs) and CFBs are also used to obtain the spatial
species profiles of laminar flames without and with stretch, respectively.
Stagnation flow burners (STBs) are used to measure the product gas
compositions of laminar stretched premixed flames. Microflow reactors
with a controlled temperature profile (MFR) [165] visualizes reactivity
and provides speciation data of weak flames. These combustion prop-
erties have been extensively used for validating the models of various
hydrocarbon fuels [166,167]. Thus, the methodology of the model
validation using these combustion properties is a promising way to
develop reliable chemical kinetic models for ammonia combustion.

Ammonia is a key species of volatile nitrogen during the combustion
of practical fuels, particularly from coal and biomass [168], which yield
NOx; it is also a reducing agent for NOx reduction. Chemical kinetic
models of ammonia have been extensively validated using ammonia/-
NOx reactions [169,170]. Due to the recent demand of energy utilization
of ammonia, this chapter focuses on its ignition (oxidation) and flame
properties for model validation. Specific issues and care taken during
ammonia combustion experiments are also introduced.

2N2 + 3

4O2 = 1

Two definitions of âequivalence ratioâ for ammonia are available in
the literature. One considers N2 as a final product of the energy utili-
zation of ammonia: NH3 + 3
2H2O, and the other definition
considers NO as the final product as ammonia is used as feedstock in
chemical industries: NH3 + 5
4O2 = NO + 3
2H2O. The former definition is
discussed herein. For ammonia co-firing with other fuels, the ammonia
fuel fraction is defined based on its volumetric fraction in the total fuel
mixture. However, blend fraction can also be defined based on the en-
ergy fraction with a lower heating value. The label âXâ uses the former
volumetric definition, and the label âEâ uses the latter energetic defi-
nition. For example, X30 indicates 30 % of ammonia volumetric fraction
in a fuel and E30 indicates 30 % of ammonia energy fraction in the fuel
mixture. Note that E30 is equivalent to X24.8 with hydrogen and X52.0
with methane, respectively. This review only focuses on hydrogen as a
co-firing fuel. The label âairâ indicates O2/inert mixtures with the O2/
inert ratio similar to the O2/N2 ratio in air. Notably, He, N2, CO2, and/or
Ar are generally used as an inert gas for controlling the compressed
temperature in RCM experiments.

3.2. Developments in experimental combustion research on ammonia

3.2.1. Experiments with ammonia as the only fuel

Takeyama and Miyama measured the first ignition delay data of
ammonia from the ultraviolet absorption of OH radicals in an ST at
1550â2300 K at a pressure region of 3.5â5.5 bar [171]. They discussed
the oxidation mechanism of ammonia in a series of publications

Fig. 10. Impacts of N2O + H = OH* + N2 proposed by Hidaka et al. [182] on the OH* time history and ammonia ignition criteria. The chemical kinetic model of
ammonia proposed by Dagaut et al. [191] combined with OH* chemistry reported by Hall and Petersen used for âmodel without N2O + H = OH* + N2â [179].

[171â174]. Bradley et al. confirmed that ignition delay times obtained
by monitoring OH and NH3 emissions in an ST at 2000â3000 K were
identical [175]. Bull increased the temperature to 4500 K and identified
intermediates in ammonia oxidation using infra-red emissions [176].
Drummond obtained the ignition delay times of ammonia from the ul-
traviolet absorption of OH, NH, and HN2 radicals in an ST at 1570â2460
K and three pressure regions of 0.2â0.3, 3.3â5.3, and 27.2â44.4 bar
[177]. These ignition delay data of ammonia have primarily been used
to discuss the activation energy of global reaction schemes. Fujii et al.
proposed a semiglobal reaction scheme of ammonia oxidation at high
temperatures (15 reactions) and validated it using experimental ignition
delay times [178]. In addition to the extensive validation of nitrogen
chemistry for the formation and destruction of NOx [169,170], these
ignition delay times of ammonia have not been used for the validation of
detailed chemical kinetic models of ammonia. This is because modern
facilities have gathered more amounts of data related to a broader range
of conditions.

Mathieu and Petersen successfully validated the detailed chemical
kinetic models of ammonia using ignition delay times measured in an ST
at equivalence ratios of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 and pressures of ~1.4, 11, and
30 atm at 1560â2455 K [179]. They introduced two important tech-
niques: passivation and OH* chemiluminescence from N2O + H.
Ammonia adsorbs on stainless steel. As highly diluted NH3/O2/Ar
mixtures prepared in a stainless-steel chamber are typical in STs for
measuring ammonia ignition delay times, ammonia adsorption may
result in unknown initial concentrations. Mathieu and Petersen intro-
duced passivation for ST experiments; the chamber wall was flushed
with ammonia under vacuum to attain the saturation of ammonia
adsorption on the chamber surface before each mixture preparation. The
passivation in STs was also used for NH3âNO reactions [180] and NH2
quantification [181].

The time histories of OH* chemiluminescence are typically used to
determine ignition delay times in ST experiments. Several criteria are
used to determine the ignition event such as rising, half, and peak points
in the time-history of OH* chemiluminescence. Therefore, a chemical
kinetic model of OH* chemiluminescence must be included for simula-
tions, and the computational ignition event must be determined from
the computed OH* time history using the same criteria. Mathieu and
Petersen realized the importance of N2O + H = OH* + N2 reaction
proposed by Hidaka et al. [182] in determining the ammonia ignition
event
from the OH* time history, as shown in Fig. 10. Chem-
iluminescence chemistry is also important for flame diagnostics. Further

chemiluminescence studies are important to accurately identify an
ignition event and flame front.

Zhu et al. [183] measured NO time histories during NH3/O2 oxida-
tion with 90 % Ar dilution at a pressure of 3.08 bar and equivalence
ratios of 0.5â1.5 at 1581â2720 K using an ST via tunable diode laser
absorption spectroscopy to identify the ignition event. Species time
histories in STs were also measured for studying ammonia pyrolysis at
low-to-atmospheric pressures and high temperatures [36,184,185]. To
extend validation conditions to practically important conditions of in-
termediate temperatures and high pressures with air, Shu et al.
measured the ignition delay times of NH3/air mixtures using an ST at
1100â1600 K and pressures of 20 and 40 bar [186]; however, their re-
sults may have been susceptible to pre-ignition pressure rise caused by
the intermediate temperatures. Pochet et al. reported ignition delay
times of ammonia/âairâ mixtures using a RCM at equivalence ratios of
0.2 and 0.35 at 1000â1100 K and pressures of 43â65 bar [187].
Although Pochet et al. used the passivation technique, they reported no
statistical differences with and without its use. Ammonia adsorption
would not be significant [188] when determining the ignition delay
times from the pressure time history (low dilutio mixtures). He et al.
[189] and Dai et al. [190] also used RCMs to measure the ignition delay
times of ammonia at compressed temperature and pressure conditions
similar to those reported by Pochet et al. [187]. However, He et al. [189]
and Dai et al. [190] added ignition delay time data at fuel-rich condi-
tions and lower O2 fractions than air.

Species measurements for ammonia oxidation have been performed
since the 1950s [192â195], and techniques for conducting reactor ex-
periments have considerably improved over time. As the speciation data
from reactors were previously compared to numerical simulations in
zero-dimensional transient systems for model validation, the assessment
and minimization of reactive radical doping, non-ideal mixing, and
finite-rate thermalization are essential. This is because these phenomena
potentially affect the initial values [162].

Song et al. [196] measured the NH3, O2, and N2O during the
oxidation of highly diluted NH3/O2/N2 mixtures at equivalence ratios of
1.0 and 0.2 and pressures of 30 and 100 bar at 450â925 K using quartz
and alumina PFR. They also measured NO and NO2, which were less
than the detection limits measured during experiments. This was
possibly because only small amounts of ammonia remained in the con-
ditions considered. Moreover, ammonia oxidation in a quartz reactor
proceeded at a lower temperature than that in an alumina reactor,
indicating ammonia decomposition on quartz surfaces [197â199]. The

11

M. Monge-Palacios et al.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 105 (2024) 101177

surface effect is likely due to the long residence times (more than several
seconds and several tens of seconds). Such a phenomenon was not
observed in quartz reactor experiments conducted for fast NO reduction
with ammonia, with residence times less than 0.1 s [200].

Stagni et al. [201] investigated ammonia oxidation using highly
diluted NH3/O2/He mixtures at lean- and near-atmospheric-pressure
conditions using a quartz JSR and an alumina PFR at 500â2000 K.
They found significant ammonia decomposition on alumina surfaces in
preliminary experiments at high temperatures; therefore, recrystallized
high-purity alumina was adopted in subsequent PFR experiments.
Manna et al. [202] also investigated the surface effect on ammonia
oxidation for a stoichiometric NH3/O2/Ar mixtures at slightly low
dilution of 86 % and atmospheric pressure using quartz and alumina
PFRs. They confirmed no significant difference in ammonia oxidation
between the quartz and alumina PFRs from O2 and H2 results obtained at
900â1350 K. However, they confirmed a difference in NO formation
between the quartz and alumina PFRs at 900â1300 K. They highlighted
the possibility of water surface passivation in ammonia pyrolysis ex-
periments using the quartz JSR when a small amount of H2O was
introduced in the diluent. Moreover, H2O did not affect ammonia
oxidation [202].

Sabia et al. [203] extended speciation data at lean- and fuel-rich
conditions for ammonia oxidation with oxygen and validated several
detailed kinetic models of ammonia. Ben Ìes et al. [33] confirmed no
difference in NH3 conversion and H2 formation between quartz and
nonporous alumina PFRs for ammonia pyrolysis using N2 and Ar dilu-
ents at various residence times and atmospheric pressures. Abi Ìan et al.
used the same quartz PFR for oxidizing highly diluted NH3/O2/N2
mixtures at atmospheric pressure and 875â1450 K and an equivalence
ratio range of 0.04â2.4 [204]. They did not detect N2O although it is
typically an important intermediate in ammonia oxidation. Tang et al.
[205] conducted ammonia oxidation experiments using JSR using 2 %
NH3/O2/Ar mixtures, with equivalence ratios of 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0; at-
mospheric pressure; and residence time of 3 s at 700â1200 K. They re-
ported negligible surface effect for sufficiently low S/V ratios [200], and
the onset of ammonia oxidation was identical to that reported by Stagni
et al. [201].

Tang et al. [205] measured NH3, H2O, NO, NO2, and N2O via syn-
chrotron vacuum ultraviolet (SVUV) photoionization mass spectrometry
and H2, N2, and O2 via gas chromatography. Glarborg et al. [170]
concluded that the loss of radicals on the quartz reactor surface is
insignificant to the reactions of NH3/NO/O2/H2O mixtures based on
numerical predictions with surface reactions. Microcombustion studies
indicated that radical quenching on the quartz reactor surface barely
affects gas-phase reactions around 1200 K, which is relevant to NH3
oxidation and NO reduction, although methane was previously used
[206,207]. Glarborg et al. [170] also indicated the necessity of careful
interpretation of the decomposition or oxidation of reactive species such
as ammonia on the reactor surface. These aforementioned reviews
indicate that researchers have attempted to reduce the surface effects on
ammonia oxidation in experiments using reactors; however, further
improvements and detailed assessment on the surface effect are
necessary.

Cohen first reported the laminar flame speed data of ammonia/air
mixtures measured using a Bunsen burner and FFB at 423 K and atmo-
spheric pressure [208]. Zakaznov et al. measured the laminar flame
speeds of ammonia/air mixtures at normal temperature and atmo-
spheric pressure for upward laminar flames in a vertical cylindrical tube
[209]. Clodic and Jabbour [210] and Sadaghiani et al. [211] measured
the laminar flame speeds of ammonia and hydrofluorocarbons using the
vertical tube method to evaluate the flammability of refrigerants
because ammonia (R717 from ASHRAE refrigerant number) is a good
refrigerant with zero ozone depletion potential (ODP) and zero global
warming potential (GWP). However, these laminar flame speed data
were affected by wallâflame interaction.

Ronney measured the laminar flame speeds of ammonia/air mixtures

using a CVC under microgravity at normal temperature over a pressure
range of 50â1500 torr [212]. A CVC was also used for the laminar flame
speed measurements of ammonia/air mixtures at normal temperature
and atmospheric pressure by Pfahl et al. [213] and Takizawa et al.
[214]. Using CVCs, the effects of wallâflame interaction on laminar
flame speeds can be minimized. During the same period of these laminar
flame speed measurements for ammonia, techniques for measuring
laminar flame speeds using CVCs were considerably improved for hy-
drocarbons to mitigate the effects of ignition and stretch [164]. Hay-
akawa et al. measured the laminar flame speeds of ammonia/air
mixtures using a CVC with recent techniques at normal temperatures
and 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 bar [215]. They also first validated a model using
the measured laminar flame speeds of ammonia/air mixtures. Subse-
quently,
the laminar flame speeds of ammonia were extensively
measured using CVCs in various conditions such as oxy-ammonia [216],
oxygen enrichment [217â221], elevated temperatures up to 473 K at
atmospheric pressure [218,222], and elevated pressures up to 0.5 MPa
at normal temperature [215,217]. Hou et al. measured the laminar
flame speeds for NH3/O2/He/Ar mixtures at pressures up to 1.5 MPa and
normal temperature using a CVC, wherein helium was used to prevent
cellular instability at high pressures [223]. Han et al. successfully
measured laminar flame speeds for ammonia/air mixture at normal
conditions using a HFB [224] and extended the initial temperatures up
to 448 K [225]. Wang et al. measured the laminar flame speed of a
stoichiometric ammonia/air mixture at normal temperature and 5 bar
using a HFB [226].

Laminar flame speeds of ammonia at high temperatures and high
pressures are required for power generation (e.g., adiabatic compression
of air to 10 bar at 575 K) Gas turbines occasionally operate at pressures
above 40 bar. Shrestha et al. obtained the laminar flame speeds of
ammonia/air mixtures using a CVC over an equivalence ratio range of
0.8â1.4 at 473 K and 3 bar [219]. They also reported a laminar flame
speed of an ammonia/air mixture at an equivalence ratio of 1.1 and 473
K and 10 bar, but with a very large error bar. Kanoshima et al. reported
the laminar flame speeds of ammonia/air mixtures over an equivalence
ratio range of 0.8â1.2 at 500 K and 5 bar [227]. However, bridging the
gap between fundamental and practical conditions of high temperatures
and high pressures remains challenging. Karan et al. applied laminar
flame speed measurements at engine-relevant high-temperature and
high-pressure conditions using constant-volume spherically propagating
flames in a CVC for oxygen-enriched NH3/O2/He/Ar mixtures [228].
They traced both pressure and flame radius during spherical flame
propagation with increasing pressure and estimated laminar flame
speeds from instantaneous pressure and flame radius using the

12

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 105 (2024) 101177

correlation between burned mass fraction and pressure via direct nu-
merical simulations [229,230].

Improving the accuracy of laminar flame speed measurements for
ammonia is another challenge. As described above, laminar flame speed
measurements have been considerably improved for hydrocarbons, with
very small uncertainties in measurements (<5 % in typical hydrocar-
bons) [164]. As shown in Fig. 11, however, the laminar flame speeds of
an ammonia/air mixture shows larger uncertainty than those of hy-
drocarbons, possibly due to the unique characteristic of ammonia of
very low laminar flame speed (large flame thickness) despite being a
small molecule. An uncertainty analysis indicates that radiation-induced
error has the largest impact on the uncertainty of the laminar flame
speeds of ammonia [218]. Radiation heat loss from flames considerably
decreases the laminar flame speeds, particularly for very small values
[218,231,232]. In contrast, radiation reabsorption increases laminar
flame speeds as ammonia is a radiative species [233].

The flame structure of ammonia and emissions from ammonia flames
can be examined using the measured species data. The flame structure of
ammonia has been studied using FFBs at low pressures for ammonia/
oxygen mixtures [234â237]. However, flame species data for ammo-
nia/air mixtures at atmospheric or elevated pressures are still limited,
possibly because forming steady ammonia/air flames in FFB is difficult.
Probe sampling is also difficult for ammonia/air flames because of the
associated heat loss.

Brackmann et al. [238] demonstrated the formation of steady
stretched ammonia/air flames using an STB at atmospheric pressure
using a careful procedure of ignition and co-flow supply. They acquired
quantitative OH, NO, and NH profiles using laser-induced fluorescence
(LIF) and profiles of temperature and relative oxygen concentration
using rotational coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS) for
stretched ammonia/air flames at equivalence ratios of 0.9, 1.0, and 1.2.
Hayakawa et al. [239] formed steady stretched ammonia/air flames
using an STB with a heated top plate at 1 and 3 bar. They quantified
H2O, NH3, NO2, and N2O volume fractions using Fourier-transform
infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and dry H2 using a hydrogen analyzer for
burned gas sampled from the center of the top plate.

Nakamura et al. [240,241] confirmed the existence of weak flames of
ammonia/air mixtures in an MFR and obtained mole fraction profiles of
NH3, O2, H2O, NO, and N2O using a quadrupole mass spectrometer
(QMS) at equivalence ratios of 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2 and atmospheric pres-
sure. Osipova et al. [242] formed a steady NH3/O2/Ar flame (O2/Ar
ratio close to O2/N2 ratio of air) on an FFB at a burner temperature of
368 K and atmospheric pressure. They measured the mole fraction
profiles of NH3, O2, N2, H2O, H2, N2O, and NO using a QMS with
molecular-beam sampling. In addition to model validation, the specia-
tion data for ammonia/air and ammonia/âairâ flames proved that N2O
emissions, with a GWP approximately 300 times higher than that of CO2,
is not significant when ammonia is completely combusted. In contrast,
the data also showed that N2O is a major intermediate in the ammo-
nia/air flame structure. Therefore, incomplete combustion in cases, such
as at insufficient residence time and near cold combustion chamber
walls, may cause N2O emission. Colson et al. used a CFB to obtain the
stretch rate at extinction for ammonia/air premixed flames at 1 and 5
bar [243]; however, species profiles in CFB for ammonia have not been
reported yet.

3.2.2. Experiments with ammonia/NOx mixtures

As ammonia is a good reducing agent for NO, NO concentration was
extensively measured in various reactors with NH3. Because of quite low
reactivity of NH3/NO mixtures [300], NH3/NO/O2 have been chosen as
base mixtures in experiments [244â257]. The presence of O2 supports
H-atom abstraction reactions of ammonia with H/O radicals, and sub-
sequent reactions of NH2 + NO are important for NO reduction and
ammonia consumption [170].

Lyon and Benn [245] explored the effects of O2 concentration on NO
reduction by NH3 using a PFR and estimated the overall reduction rate.

Kasuya et al. [246] showed that the onset temperature of NO reduction
decreases with increasing O2 concentration using a PFR. Dagaut [247]
investigated NH3âNOâO2 reactions and showed that the onset temper-
ature of NH3 oxidation in a JSR decreases with increasing NO concen-
tration. As the exhaust gases in practical combustion systems may
contain unburned intermediates, the effects of combustibles such as CO,
H2, and CH4 on NO reductions were investigated [244,248â251,
255â257]. With a remarkable discrepancy between experiment and
predictions, Rota et al. [254] reported that H2O does not affect NO
reduction in NH3/NO/O2 mixtures in a JSR, whereas Glarborg et al.
[170] indicated that a recent model predicts the increase in the onset
temperature of NO reduction with increasing H2O content.

For NOx reduction by ammonia, reactions of NH3/NO2 mixtures have
been studied using several flow reactors [258â261]. Glarborg et al.
[260] found that NH2 + NO2 = N2O + H2O is dominant at low tem-
peratures, whereas NH2 + NO2 = H2NO + NO is dominant at high
temperatures. The NH3âNO2 reaction system is also important for the
combustion of ammonium salts such as ammonium dinitramide and
ammonium nitrate because NH3/NO2 mixtures are formed after the
initial stage of combustion of ammonium salts [549]. In contrast, NO2
emissions from ammonia combustion are not significant [239], and the
effect of the NH3âNO2 reaction system on ammonia combustion has not
been identified yet. Recently, Glarborg [262] reported that NH2 + NO2
reaction is crucial for ammonia ignition because H2NO formation may
be involved in chain-branching reactions.

N2O is a major intermediate of ammonia combustion. Experimental
data for NH3âN2O reactions can improve the ammonia chemical kinetic
models. As N2O is a good source of oxygen radicals from N2O decom-
position at high temperatures, NH3âN2O reactions have been investi-
gated using STs. The ignition delay times of a NH3/N2O/Ar mixture were
measured from OH and N2O absorption in an ST at 1535â1821 K and a
pressure range of 3â6 atm by Drummond and Hiscock [263]. The igni-
tion delay times were also measured using an interferometer and from
ultraviolet OH and infrared N2O emissions in an ST at 1600â3200 K by
Soloukhin [264]. The time histories of NH3, N2O, H2O NO, OH, and NH2
were measured via laser absorption and emission spectroscopy in an ST
at 1600â2100 K and in a pressure region of 0.8â1.1 atm for NH3/N2O/Ar
mixtures by Salimian et al. [188]. Cornell et al. [265] recently con-
ducted species measurements of NH3/N2O/N2 mixtures at lower tem-
peratures (850â1180 K) using a JSR.

These studies conducted on NH3/NOx mixtures used STs and re-
actors. A few studies on the flame characteristics of NH3/NOx have also
been conducted. The laminar flame speeds of stoichiometric NH3/N2O
and NH3/NO mixtures were measured using a Bunsen burner by Parker
and Wolfhard [266] and a CVC by Andrews and Gray [267]. Checkel
et al. [268] measured the laminar flame speeds of NH3/NO mixtures at
atmospheric pressure and temperatures of 25
C, and
205
C over a wide range of equivalence ratios using a heated CVC. Liu
et al. [269] used the experimental laminar flame speeds of NH3/NO
mixtures for validating detailed reaction models of ammonia.

Han et al. [270] recently measured the laminar flame speeds of
NH3/N2O/air mixtures at atmospheric pressure and 298 K with varying
equivalence ratios and N2O mixing ratios. Mei et al. [271] measured the
laminar flame speeds of NH3/NO/N2 mixtures at atmospheric pressure,
298 K, and 50:50 NO:N2 with varying equivalence ratios using a CVC.
These data of NH3/NOx mixtures were used for validating the detailed
reaction models of ammonia. More laminar flame speed data of
NH3/NOx mixtures across a broader range of conditions will be helpful
for further validation of ammonia reaction models. However, con-
ducting flame experiments on NH3/NO2 mixtures is challenging. Due to
the equilibrium of N2O4 â 2NO2, accurately estimating NO2 concen-
tration in an initial/inlet mixture and eliminating the effects of N2O4 on
experimental results are difficult. In addition, Parker and Wolfhard
[266] reported that a laminar flame speed measurement for a NH3/NO2
mixture failed because NH3 and NO2 immediately reacted during mixing
even after the gases were carefully dried separately.

3.2.3. Experiments with ammonia/hydrogen mixtures

The ignition delay times of NH3/H2 mixtures measured at high
temperatures using STs were reported by Drummond in 1972 [177] and
Fujii in 1981 [178]. From the 1990sâ2010s, ignition delay times of
NH3/H2 mixtures using STs were not reported. Chen et al. [272] recently
measured the ignition delay times of highly diluted stoichiometric
NH3/H2/O2/Ar mixtures at pressures of 1.2 and 10 atm and ammonia
fuel fractions of X30, X70, and X95 at 1020â1960 K in an ST using the
passivation method. The ignition delay time of NH3/H2 mixtures using
STs have not been extensively measured. For measuring the ignition
delay times of NH3/H2 mixtures at low temperatures and high pressures,
several RCM experiments were conducted. The first such study was
conducted using an equivalence ratio of 0.35 with âairâ, compressed
pressure of 43.4 bar, and ammonia fuel fractions of X90 and X25 at
1000â1100 K by Pochet et al. [187]. He et al. [189] reported the ignition
delay times of NH3/H2 mixtures at equivalence ratios of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5
with a constant dilution ratio of 70 %, compressed pressures of 20 and
40 bar, and ammonia fuel fractions of X85, X90, X95, and X99 at
970â1130 K using an RCM. Dai et al. [190] reported the ignition delay
times of NH3/H2 mixtures at equivalence ratios of 0.5 and 1.0 with near
âairâ and ammonia fuel fractions of X90 and X95 at pressures and
temperatures of 20â60 bar and 960â1150 K, respectively.

These RCM studies showed that the agreement of model predictions
with measured results depends on fuel and pressure conditions. For
example, models that showed good agreement with measured results at
pure ammonia conditions (low-pressure conditions) yielded predictions
large discrepancy with measured results at NH3/H2 conditions (high-
pressure conditions). Dai et al. [190] demonstrated the sensitivity of the
rate constant of NH2 radical recombination reaction, NH2 + NH2 (+M)
= N2H4 (+M), on the prediction performance at different H2 blending
ratios and pressures.

Several experimental studies reported the laminar flame speeds of
NH3/H2/O2 mixtures from 1950s to 1960s [273â275]. These values
were not reported for many years thereon. In 2010s, ammonia was
recognized as a carbon-free fuel and NH3/H2/air mixtures garnered
attention for their improved laminar flame speeds. The laminar flame
speeds of NH3/H2/air mixtures at normal temperature and atmospheric
pressure were initially reported.

Lee et al. measured the laminar flame speeds of NH3/H2/air mixtures
at equivalence ratios of 0.60â1.67 and an ammonia fuel fraction range of
X0âX30 [276] and X50âX100 [277] using a CVC. Kumar and Meyer
[278] measured the laminar flame speeds of NH3/H2/air mixtures at an
equivalence ratio range of 0.55â1.1 and an ammonia fuel fraction range
of E0âE80 using a Bunsen burner. Li et al. [279] measured the laminar
flame speeds of NH3/H2/air mixtures at equivalence ratios of 1.00, 1.10,
and 1.25 over an ammonia fuel fraction range of X40.0âX66.7. Subse-
quently, the temperature and pressure conditions of laminar flame speed
measurements for NH3/H2/air mixtures were extended at normal tem-
perature and elevated pressures [280,281], elevated temperatures and
atmospheric pressure [222], and elevated temperatures and pressures
[219,282]. These studies also reported cellular flame formation at high
hydrogen fractions and high pressures. For hydrogen supply from
ammonia cracking, the laminar flame speeds of NH3/H2/N2/air mix-
tures were also measured [283,301,302]. For ammonia co-firing with
biomass gasification, the laminar flame speeds of NH3/CO/air [224,
226] and NH3/syngas/air [226,284,286â288] mixtures were also
measured.

In addition to laminar flame speeds, the extinction limits, flame
structure, and chemiluminescence spectra of NH3/H2 flames using CFBs
were reported. Choi et al. [289] measured the extinction limits and
temperature profiles of non-premixed flames with NH3/H2 stream
versus preheated air up to 495 K at atmospheric pressure and high
ammonia fuel fractions of X89âX99. Tang et al. [290] applied Raman
spectroscopy for non-premixed flames with NH3/H2/N2 stream versus
air at normal temperature and an elevated pressure of 5 bar; they ob-
tained profiles of temperature and reactants and products (NH3, H2, O2,

14

H2O, and N2). Zhu et al. [291] obtained UV and visible chem-
iluminescence spectra for premixed NH3/H2/air flames over an
ammonia fuel fraction range of X55âX90, an equivalence ratio range of
(cid:0) 1. This spectral data
0.35â1.70, and a stretch rate range of 50â300 s
were not compared with numerical predictions; however, they will be
valuable for the future validation of chemiluminescence chemistry.

FFBs coupled with mass spectrometry have been used to obtain
speciation data for NH3/H2 flames. Fenimore and Jones in 1961 [292]
first obtained the speciation data for NH3/H2 flames in FFB at a low
pressure. Bian et al. [293] and Vandooren [294] reported speciation
data for H2/O2/Ar flames doped with NH3 at a low pressure of 34.5 Torr
using FFBs in 1990s. They examined NO formation from flames and
reported that their ammonia fuel fractions were low (<X20). Duyn-
slaegher et al. [295] further extended ammonia fuel fractions up to X83
for its use as fuel and reported speciation data for near-stoichiometric
NH3/H2/O2/Ar flames at low pressures. Recent FFB experiments for
NH3/H2 flames were conducted at atmospheric pressure [242,296].

In addition to the speciation data derived at high temperatures using
FFBs, several studies focused on determining species data at interme-
diate temperatures were conducted using JSRs. Zhang et al. [297]
investigated the oxidation of highly diluted NH3/H2/O2/N2 mixtures at
atmospheric pressure, equivalence ratios of 0.25 and 1.0, and residence
time of 1 s at 800â1280 K and an ammonia fuel fraction range of
X30âX100 using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Osi-
pova et al. [298] measured reactants and products (NH3, H2O, N2, O2,
and H2) in the oxidation of highly diluted NH3/H2/O2/Ar mixtures at
atmospheric pressure, an ammonia fraction of X70, residence time of 1 s,
and equivalence ratios of 0.6, 1.0, and 1.5 at 800â1300 K using a
quadrupole mass spectrometer. These two studies discussed the
enhancement of ammonia reactivity due to the addition of hydrogen.
Manna et al. [299] conducted JSR experiments for NH3/H2/O2/N2
mixtures at low dilution ratios of 86 % and 90 % at a pressure of 1.4 atm;
ammonia fuel fractions of X95, X90, and X85; and residence time of 0.21
over a temperature range of 900â1350 K and an equivalence ratio of
0.2â1.2. Table 2 provides a comprehensive summary of fundamental
combustion chemistry experiments for ammonia.

4. Chemical kinetics of ammonia oxidation and pyrolysis

4.1. Molecular structure of ammonia

Ammonia is a chemical species containing one nitrogen atom cova-
lently bonded by a single bond to three hydrogen atoms. The central
nitrogen atom is sp3-hybridized and has a lone pair of electrons, forming
a polar molecule (1.47 D [304]) with a trigonal pyramidal molecular
geometry (Fig. 12) with NâH bond distances and HâNâH angles of 1.012
Ã and 106.7
, respectively. The ammonia molecule has a C3 rotational
axis (three-fold axis) and three Ïv vertical symmetry planes; thus, it
belongs to the C3v point group symmetry with a rotational symmetry
number Ïrot of 3.

â¦

Ammonia has a high NâH bond dissociation energy of 107.0 [305]
(cid:0) 1, as reported via experiments and quantum
and 107.4 [306] kcal mol
chemistry calculations, respectively. This bond dissociation energy is
generally larger than those of CâH and OâH bonds in alcohols [307,308],
which are also alternative fuels that have been extensively investigated
[167]. For instance, the calculated CâH and OâH bond dissociation en-
(cid:0) 1, respectively, and
ergies in tert-butanol are 103.9 and 104.1 kcal mol
that of CâH bond of the tertiary C atom in iso-propanol is even lower, i.e.,
94.1 kcal mol

(cid:0) 1.

These structural and electronic structure features of NH3 determine
its behavior during its oxidation and pyrolysis. For instance, the strong
NâH bond in NH3 than other fuels is reflected in its low reactivity and
thus high resistance to autoignition. Thus, it has lower laminar flame
speed than hydrocarbon and oxygenated fuels [219,222].

between amidogen (NH2) and nitric oxide. They concluded that the
combination of NH2 and NO mainly leads to chain-branching (NNH +
OH) and chain-termination (N2+H2O) channels. Miller and Glarborg
later proposed a temperature- and pressure-dependent branching ratio
of NH2+NO for the aforementioned two channels [314]. In 2011,
Klippenstein et al. [315] updated the Miller and Glarborg model [314]
based on ab initio calculations. They concluded that the thermal DeNOx
process is mainly determined by a small branching fraction of the
NH2+NO reaction rather than by the subsequent reactions of NNH with
NO and O2.

et al.,

One of the earliest ammonia combustion models was published by
Miller
in 1983 [316], which was validated against
burner-stabilized and freely propagating NH3/O2 and NH3/H2/O2
flames. Specific reaction pathways leading to the formation of NO were
discussed under fuel-lean and fuel-rich conditions. Miller and Bowman
later proposed a kinetic model for NH3, HCN, and the interaction reac-
tion mechanisms between N-containing species and C1âC2 hydro-
carbons/radicals [169]. This mechanism was validated against the
experimental targets in flow reactors, JSRs, and burner-stabilized flames
at 950â2256 K, 0.046â1.2 atm, and equivalence ratios of 0.7â1.9. Their
study provided the thermochemistry and rate constants of elementary
reactions in ammonia models, which formed the building blocks for
understanding the chemistry of ammonia and the formation and
destruction mechanisms of nitrogen oxides [169].

Lindstedt et al. constructed a detailed model for NH3, NH3/H2, NH3/
NO, NH3/CO, NH3/CH4, and NH3/C2H6 by reviewing and evaluating the
kinetic data available in the literature and these models were validated
against the experimental data obtained from flow reactors, burner-
stabilized flames, and counter-flow diffusion flames [317,318]. They
concluded that the formation and destruction of NO were dominated by
NHi radicals (i.e., NH2, NH, and N). The relative significance of NHi
radicals in various NO formation channels depends on conditions,
whereas the role of NH2 is crucial in NO reduction. Glarborg et al.
investigated the nitrogen combustion chemistry, including NH3 and the
interaction chemistry between C- and N-containing species [196,200,
260,315,319â321]. Both experimental methods and advanced theoret-
ical calculation methods were used to assist the development of these
models. Among these modeling studies, Tian et al. [319] proposed a
detailed kinetic model for NH3/CH4 combustion and validated it against
speciation
using
synchrotron-based vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrom-
etry (SVUV-PIMS). The interaction reaction mechanisms between C1 and
N-containing species were mainly adopted from Dean and Bozzelli, in
which the reaction pathways and rate parameters were evaluated based
on quantum RiceâRamspergerâKassel (QRRK) estimates [322]. This
is widely cited in studies related to combustion [217,282,
model
323â325]. Glarborg and Klippenstein et al. [315] conducted another

4.2. Construction of comprehensive chemical kinetic models

Chemical kinetic models can facilitate the fundamental under-
standing of a reaction system as well as the design and optimization of
devices for practical applications [309]. Many chemical kinetic models
for ammonia, unlike those for other fuels, have been proposed in recent
years. However, most of these models focus on specific combustion
conditions and have been validated against limited experimental tar-
gets. A few among them are comprehensive chemical kinetic models
validated against experimental data covering chemically reacting flows
at various temperatures, pressures, and equivalence ratios in various
reactors [310,311]. These models are more reliable for understanding
the fundamental combustion chemistry and their applications in en-
gines. Therefore,
this review introduces the chemical kinetics of
ammonia mainly based on comprehensive kinetic models, whose evo-
lution is depicted in Fig. 13. Nevertheless, pioneering modeling studies
reported several decades ago are also reviewed here as they are the
foundation for developing such models. Table 3 summarizes the pro-
posed NH3 models and their validation targets and conditions. Models
developed in the same group are placed together.

The initial motivation for ammonia modeling was to explain the
controlling kinetics in thermal DeNOx process, which is selective non-
catalytic reduction (SNCR) [312]. Miller developed a kinetic model to
explain the important features of the reaction between ammonia and
nitric oxide in 1981 [313] and reported the elementary steps that con-
trol the DeNOx features as well as identified an important reaction

high-impact modeling work, in which critical reactions related to NNH
were theoretically studied and a detailed model was constructed based
on their calculations. This model was validated against ammonia
oxidation in a ST and DeNOx experimental data obtained from jet-stirred
and flow reactors at 900â2160 K and 1â5 atm.

Modeling studies on ammonia have been extensively reported in
recent years. Some involved updating previous models by replacing the
rate parameters of critical reactions to better match their experimental
data [326], whereas some involved combining different reported models
to create a new model for predicting newly obtained experimental data
[285,327]. These updated/merged models are generally validated based
on limited experimental data and therefore have limited predictability
[218,247,286,328,329]. For example, Mei et al. developed a detailed
ammonia model to predict their measured laminar flame speed data and
high-temperature conditions
reported in the literature such as
burner-stabilized flames and ignition delay times [217]. Although this
approach increases the reliability of models at high temperatures, they
are not comprehensively validated as their performance at low and in-
termediate temperatures remains unclear.

Comprehensive kinetic models need to be validated against high-
temperature experimental targets as well as low- and intermediate-
temperature targets such as flow reactor experiments at high pressures
[196], ignition delay times measured in RCMs [187,189], and speciation
data in JSRs. Several comprehensive ammonia models are reviewed
herein, and their performance is described in subsequent sections. Note
that although some of the comprehensive ammonia models selected in
this review were not comprehensively validated when they were pub-
they were selected and validated against wide ranges of
lished,

experimental data by researchers in subsequent works.

The Nakamura model [241], reported in 2017, was developed based
on Miller and Bowmanâs modeling work [169]. The chemistry of N2H4,
N2H3, and N2H2 was updated based on the Konnov model [330]. Ther-
modynamic data and several other kinetic rate parameters of critical
reactions were also improved based on literature review and evaluation.
The complete model comprised 38 species and 232 reactions and was
validated against speciation data measured in a micro flow reactor,
ignition delay times, and laminar flame speed data. In addition to the
sub-mechanism of ammonia, those of hydrazine, H2/N2O, and H2/NO2
were validated in their modeling study. Y. Zhang et al. proposed a ki-
netic model for H2/NOx and syngas/NOx by incorporating the sub-sets of
the Zeldovich mechanism, N/O and H/N/O schemes, and NH3
sub-mechanism [331]. Thermodynamic and kinetic data were derived
from previous measurements, theoretical calculations, and modeling
studies. The NH3 sub-mechanism was mainly adopted from Mathieu and
Petersen [179], whereas the sub-schemes of NNH and NH2OH species
were obtained from the theoretical calculations of Klippenstein et al.
[315,332]. This model was validated against the experimental targets of
H2/CO/NOx and NH3 measured in STs, JSRs, flow reactors, and RCMs.
The speciation data and global parameters (i.e., ignition delay times and
laminar flame speeds) were compared with those predicted by the model
at 700â2800 K, 0.1â100 atm, and a wide range of equivalence ratios.
This model was also adopted as the base model for their further studies
on NOx-doped hydrocarbon fuels [333â337]. Recently, Zhu et al. from
the same group published a comprehensive kinetic modeling study on
NH3 and NH3/H2 mixtures [338]. They used rate constants that had
reliable sources and generally better predict experimental targets. In

particular, the authors adjusted the original rate constants that failed to
capture the experimental targets to achieve a better prediction. Ignition
delay times, laminar flame speeds, and speciation data were used as the
experimental targets for model testing.

In 2018, Shrestha et al. developed a kinetic model for pure NH3 and
NH3/H2 combustion [339] by evaluating multiple literature sources
such as Baulch et al.âs kinetics database [340] and other detailed kinetic
models [314,315,341,342]. Some kinetic parameters were tuned to
better predict the experimental data. Their proposed model was vali-
dated against the experimental targets of H2/CO/NO/NO2/N2O/NH3 in
various reactors, including the speciation data in JSRs, flow reactors,
and burner-stabilized flames, and global parameters such as ignition
delay times and laminar flame speeds. The model was then extended by
the same group to model the combustion of NH3/H2 [219,343],
NH3/DEE [344], NOx/CH3OH [345], NOx/C2H5OH [345], NOx/DME
[346], and NOx/DMM [346]. Among them, the Thomas/Shrestha 2023
model [343] is the latest NH3 model, which was extended to predict the
extinction of NH3/H2 flames and subsequent NO formation.

In 2018, Glarborg et al. reviewed nitrogen combustion chemistry and
proposed detailed kinetic models for NH3, HCN, and hydrocarbon/ni-
trogen interactions [170] based on their previous modeling studies over
30 years [169,191,315,320,347â349]. They presented model validation
results against DeNOx experiments with NH3/C1âC2 hydrocarbons in
flow reactors and JSRs and ammonia oxidation data,
including
burner-stabilized flame speciation profiles and ignition delay times.
Their model was further validated by successors against ignition delay
times in RCM conditions [189,326] and laminar flame speed data [217].
This model was extended to better predict ammonia pyrolysis [350],
DeNOx process [200], NH3/methanol [351] oxidation, C2H2/NOx [352],
CH3NH2 oxidation [327], and CH3CN [353] oxidation. Among these, the
Glarborg 2023 model [262] was the latest NH3 model, which updated
critical steps in NH3 ignition and N2O formation; it was validated against
new sets of experimental data obtained from batch and flow reactors.

In 2020, Stagni et al. [201] developed a detailed ammonia model
based on earlier Polimi models [354,355] and those developed by Song
et al. [196]. The rate constants of key reactions in ammonia pyrolysis
and oxidation were computed using advanced theoretical methods.
Their model was then validated against their JSR and flow reactor
speciation data and comprehensive experimental data from the litera-
ture. The validation conditions were temperatures of 500â2800 K,
pressures of 0.026â100 atm, and equivalence ratios of 0.01 to pyrolysis.

This model was further used as the base model for modeling NH3/H2
[356], NOx/CH4 [357], and NH3/CH4 [358], combustion. The Stagni
2023 model was extended to model NH3/H2 oxidation at low and in-
termediate temperatures [356]. The effects of H2 addition on NH3
oxidation were comprehensively validated over a wide range of exper-
imental conditions.

In 2020, Jiang et al. [359] updated the San Diego model by incor-
porating the NH3 burning and NOx formation chemistry. This model was
validated against speciation targets obtained from burner-stabilized
flame and counter-flow premixed twin flame as well as the global pa-
rameters of ignition delay times, laminar flame speeds, and extinction
rates at temperatures of 900â2500 K, pressures of 0.05â40 atm, and
equivalence ratios of 0.5â2.0. Their short mechanism was also applied in
direct numerical simulations and reasonable results were obtained.

In 2021, X. Zhang et al. developed an NH3 model for the pyrolysis
and oxidation of pure NH3 and NH3/H2 mixtures [297]. The model was
developed based on previous review [360], modeling studies [217,339],
and newly obtained theoretical calculations from their study [131,361].
It was validated against speciation data measured for various reactors
and global parameters such as ignition delay times and laminar flame
speeds at temperatures of 450â2800 K, pressures of 0.05â100 atm, and
equivalence ratios of 0.0016ââ. Based on this model, X. Zhang et al.
later developed an NH3/C1 model to describe the interaction chemistry
between NH3 and C1 fuels such as syngas, CH3OH, and CH4 [362]. It was
validated at temperatures of 473â2000 K, pressures of 0.04â100 atm,
and a wide range of equivalence ratios. They concluded that C/N cross
reactions are less competitive with C/H cross reactions under flame
conditions but are highly competitive under ignition conditions.

The continuous growth in kinetic models enabled Szanthoffer et al.
to comprehensively analyze ammonia combustion using a dataset of
nearly 5000 datapoints [363]. They assessed 18 detailed models based
on experimental data from 36 publications, covering a wide range of
equivalent ratios, temperatures, and pressures. Experimental data were
collected for NH3, NH3âH2, and NH3-syngas mixtures in STs for ignition
delay times, concentration measurements in jet stirred and flow re-
actors, and laminar burning velocity measurements. Fig. 14 shows the
the
POLIMI-2020, Han-2020,
best-performing models for NH3/H2 fuel mixtures. However, none of
these models fully reproduced experimental data within their uncer-
tainty limits, highlighting the need for further development of models.

Overall, their results identified the need to cross-analyze models via
sensitivity analysis to identify the root cause of these discrepancies
[363].

4.3. NH3 quantum chemistry calculations and fundamental reaction
kinetics

Quantum chemistry (QC) calculations based on either ab initio
methods or density functional theory (DFT) combined with statistical
dynamical theories such as the transition state theory (TST) [375] or
RiceâRamspergerâKasselâMarcus (RRKM)
theory [376] are useful
theoretical tools to explore and characterize the potential energy surface
(PES) of chemical reactions and to calculate their rate constants. These
theoretical fundamental kinetic studies yield accurate rate constants
when using high levels of theory for electronic structure calculations and
they determine the
sophisticated kinetic approaches. Moreover,
branching ratios of reactions that proceed via different pathways and
thus yield different products. Obtaining these branching ratios experi-
mentally is challenging, i.e., using STs; therefore, computational kinetic
studies are widely conducted for developing kinetic models.

This section reviews computational kinetic studies on reactions
governing the gas-phase pyrolysis and oxidation of ammonia. The ac-
curacy and possible sources of errors in the corresponding rate constants
are evaluated and compared with experimental results. This assessment
is based on the quality and sophistication of the levels of theory and
kinetic approaches used for quantum chemistry and rate constant cal-
culations. To this end, a selected set of rate constants for each reaction is
tested for assembling a kinetic model that will be tested against exper-
imental data, and its performance will be compared with those of pre-
viously developed models. For quantum chemistry calculations, a
certain level of theory is deemed robust if it can handle the static and
dynamic correlation effect accurately and if large basis sets are used.
Such a consideration depends on the chemical system under investiga-
tion, as not all systems suffer from static correlation and do not require a
multireference method. The robustness of the kinetic approach is eval-
uated based on its consideration of variational, anharmonicity, and
tunneling effects because one or more of these features are occasionally
missed in computational kinetic studies. Note that our selection of a
given set of rate constants for a certain reaction is based on the above-
mentioned criteria and does not represent a recommendation.

4.3.1.

Initiation reactions

Ammonia pyrolysis and oxidation can be initiated by unimolecular

dissociation and/or by hydrogen abstraction reaction with O2:

NH3âNH2 + H

NH3 + O2âNH2 + HO2.

(R1)

(R2)

The rate constant of reaction R1 was recently calculated by Stagni
et al. using electronic structure calculations at the CASPT2/aug-cc-pVTZ
level of theory with the variational transition state theory (VTST), and
the effects of pressure were implemented by solving the master equation
[201]. At 1 atm, their rate constants were in good agreement with those
derived from reflected shock waves by Davidson et al. [185] and Dove
et al. [377], which are larger by a factor of 2 between 1740 and 3300 K.
Notably, the use of the variable reaction coordinate (VRC) theory, which
is the recommended theory for calculating reaction rate constants
without a saddle point (i.e. dissociation reactions) [378,379], may yield
more accurate rate constants. This is particularly true if an appropriate
multireference method is used to characterize the PES. The transitional
modes in H elimination reactions that involve small fragments such as
reaction R1 are not expected to be very floppy, which would make the
VTST approach valid; however, the use of the VRC formulation for such
a reaction without a saddle point would help to confirm whether further
improvement in the rate constants of reaction R1 are achievable. This is

26

supported by the fact that for similar sized association reactions
involving an H atom and the C2H3 radical (i.e., H + C2H3 â C2H4)
different approaches of the VRC-TST theory (e.g., canonical, micro-
canonical and E,J-resolved VRC-TST) can result in deviations of the rate
constants of up to 15 % with respect to those from classical trajectory
simulations [380], which is the theory that is able to accurately capture
the location of the variational transition states. This comparison in-
dicates that different improvements in the minimization of the density of
states within the VRC formulation result in minor discrepancies in the
rate constants. The experimental rate constant of shock waves deter-
mined by Davidson et al. [185] and Dove et al. [377] at atmospheric
pressure and high temperatures are in excellent agreement, with
(cid:0) 1 at 2500 K. The error
respective values of 1.48â108 and 1.33â108 s
estimated by Davidson et al. [185] for their measurements is estimated
to be Â±15 %.

Furthermore, a few other sets of rate constants determined experi-
mentally for the reaction R1 are in relatively good agreement with those
determined by Davidson et al. [185] and Dove et al. [377], indicating
that the kinetics of reaction R1 is rather precise. The rate constants re-
ported by Altinay and Macdonald [381] at low temperatures and by
Holzrichter and Wagner [184] at high temperatures using pulsed-laser
photolysis and STs, respectively, were used by Elishav et al. [360] to
derive a set of Arrhenius parameters, with the rate constant in good
agreement with both low- and high-temperature experimental data
derived at 1 atm.

Another important feature that may affect the accuracy of the rate
constants of reaction R1 and, in general, those of any reaction in the fall-
off regime, is the definition of the temperature dependence of the energy
transfer parameter ÎEdown, as highlighted by Stagni et al. in their master
equation study [201]. In their work, they fitted the temperature de-
pendency of ÎEdown as 130â(T/298)0.8 based on the measurements from
Altinay and MacDonald [381] for the recombination reaction in order to
reproduce the pressure dependency.

Notably, the dissociation of NH3 can occur via two alternative
pathways to reaction R1, i.e., those yielding H2 + 3NH and H2 + 1NH.
The former is a spin-forbidden reaction with rate constants of at least
two orders of magnitude lower than those of reaction R1 [382]. Thus,
very low branching ratios of 0.025 have been adopted for this pathway
in recent works [369,383]. The latter is a spin-allowed reaction but it is
considerably more endothermic than reaction R1, with enthalpies of
(cid:0) 1 [384]. Therefore, the selected
reaction of, 130.95 and 106.0 kcal mol
rate constants for the collisional dissociation of NH3 are those directly
measured for reaction R1 from shock waves by Davidson et al. [185] at
temperatures between 1740 and 3300 K; however, only Stagni et al.
[201] estimated the pressure effects. At low temperatures, we selected
those measured by Altinay and Macdonald [381] in the 292â533 K
temperature range. Both selected sets of rate constants were merged by
converting Davidson et al. [185] rate constants into pseudo-first order
rate constants at different pressures, i.e., 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0, and 100.0
atm, and they were fitted to fill the gap between 533 and 1740 K. The
resulting fitted rate constants cover a wider temperature range of
292â3300 K at pressures between 0.01 and 100.0 atm, and are thus our
selected values.

(cid:0) 35 at 500 K to 6.5â10

Reaction R2, together with R1, controls NH3 decomposition. To the
best of our knowledge, only Stagni et al. calculated its rate constant
using the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ//M06â2X/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory
with the microcanonical transition state theory (Î¼VT), ranging from
(cid:0) 1 at 3000 K [201].
(cid:0) 14 cm3 molecule
5.0â10
Reactions R1 and R2 are slow, which is consistent with the high
resistance to the autoignition of ammonia and the need of high tem-
peratures for its decomposition. Stagni et al. noted that reaction R2
behaves as a termination reaction rather than initiation as its reverse
reaction is rapid and efficiently consumes NH2 and HO2 radicals from
the radical pool [201]. Therefore, further details on reaction R2 will be
discussed in Section 4.3.3 together with its reverse reaction.

Many experimental and computational studies have been reported
for reaction R3. Many of those experimental works, which were pub-
lished in the early 80s or before, show discrepancies in the reported rate
constants. However, more recent works show better agreement between
computational and experimental results; the derived rate constants are
compared in Fig. 10. The flash-photolysis ST experimental rate constants
derived by Michael et al. [385,386] are in excellent agreement with
those measured by Ko et al. [387] using the high-temperature photo-
chemistry technique, particularly those experiments in which Michael
et al. implemented corrections for non-ideal shock wave behavior [386].
Beyond 700 K, results of high-temperature photochemistry experiments
conducted by Marshall et al. [388] are also in very good agreement with
the other experimental measurements.

Contrarily, the calculated rate constants show larger discrepancies of

up to one order of magnitude because different barrier heights and
methodologies are used. For instance, the rate constants calculated by
Yang and Corchado in their seven-dimensional time-dependent wave
packet dynamic calculations (yellow solid line) [389] and Yang using a
more robust full dimensional time-dependent wave packet method
(black solid line) [390] underestimate the other sets of experimental and
theoretical rate constants. This is possibly due to the assumptions made
in the wave-packet dynamic calculations and/or the drawbacks of the
PES used for dynamic calculations. The same PES, developed by
Corchado and Espinosa-Garcia and named PES-1997, was used for a
calculations with
direct

ground-state tunneling corrections to derive rate constants (green solid
line) [391]. The derived values were in very good agreement with the
experimental results. Espinosa-Garcia and Corchado further improved
PES-1997 by improving its description of the inversion of the NH3 and
by fitting it to higher level electronic structure calculations. The
as-derived rate constants (red solid line) [392] were in excellent
agreement with the experimental results and within the experimental
uncertainties. The improved PES, named PES-2009, predicted a reaction

barrier for reaction R3 of 14.48 kcal mol

the experiments within the corresponding uncertainties while covering
considerably broader temperature ranges.

As opposed to reactions R3 and R4, reaction R5 has not been widely
investigated. To the best of our knowledge, only one computational
study by Stagni et al. addressed the kinetics of this reaction. They per-
formed VTST calculations based on high-level electronic structure cal-

Finally, reaction R6 is another important hydrogen abstraction re-
action, which has been the target of several experimental and compu-
tational kinetic studies. Some of them were conducted before the 1980s
[403â407]. In Fig. 17, we plot the rate constants reported in the more
recent experimental and computational studies as a function of tem-
perature. The ST experiments conducted by Fujii et al. [397] yielded rate
constants of approximately half an order of magnitude lower than those
obtained from Salimian et al.âs ST experiments [408]. The other sets of
experimental rate constants are in excellent agreement, particularly
those derived by Perry [407] and Sutherland et al. [409] using laser
photolysisâchemiluminescence and flash photolysisâST techniques,
respectively, with low uncertainty levels. Espinosa-Garcia [410] and
Klippenstein et al. [332] used robust kinetic approaches, i.e., VTST and
master equation, respectively, with tunneling and torsional anharmo-
nicity corrections. The former used a lower level of theory for the
electronic structure calculations than the latter; however, their rate
constants were in very good agreement and within the experimental

Therefore, the rate constants selected herein for reaction R3 are
those derived from the latest experimental measurements by Ko et al.
[387] and from the calculations by Espinosa-Garcia and Corchado [392]
and Nguyen and Stanton [393], which are compared in Fig. 15. Both
calculations were based on adequate kinetic methodologies and high
level quantum chemistry calculations that likely predicted accurate
barrier heights and rate constants, covering wide temperature ranges.

Reaction R4 consumes ammonia under most oxidation conditions
due to the high reactivity of the OH radical. Consequently, this reaction
has been the target of numerous computational and experimental kinetic
studies at low and high temperatures. The reported experimental and
calculated rate constants are compared in Fig. 16. At high temperatures,
which is the temperature regime of interest in combustion, divergences
between the different sets of rate constants are larger. However, except
the theoretical studies by Espinosa-Garcia et al. [395] and Vahedpour
et al. [396] based on relatively low-level electronic structure calcula-
tions, all the experimental and calculated rate constants agreed well
within a wide temperature range. The rate constants reported by Dove
et al. [377] for reaction R4 were not measured directly but based on
those determined for reaction R1; thus, they are expected to be more
uncertain. Similarly, Fujii et al. [397] did not directly measure the rate
constants of reaction R4 and instead derived them by analyzing NH3,
OH, and N2O profiles, resulting in rate constants that agreed well with
those measured by Samu et al. [398] in methaneâair laminar flat flames
doped with NH3. The other six sets of rate constants plotted in Fig. 16 are
in excellent agreement, particularly the experimental ones [188,399].
Among the rate constants calculated by Corchado et al. [400],
Monge-Palacios et al. [401], and Nguyen et al. [402], those by
Monge-Palacios and Nguyen were in excellent agreement within the
whole temperature range. Contrarily, Corchado et al. calculated rate
constants at a lower level of theory that predicted a larger barrier height,
which are slightly lower at low temperatures. Monge-Palacios et al.
[401] used a more sophisticated kinetic approach by implementing
variational effects, which were missing in Nguyen et al.âs study. How-
ever, the latter implemented a higher level of theory to characterize the
PES by extrapolating energies to the complete basis set limit and
including higher excitation levels in their coupled-cluster wave function,
i.e., quadruples excitations, which were not used by Monge-Palacios

Similarly, Dove and Nip [377], Davidson et al. [364], and Yumura and
Asaba [414] fitted the rate constants for reaction R7 to reproduce
different species profiles such as NH3, NH2, N2, and H from reflected
shock waves. The determined values were similar and slightly under-
estimated those calculated by Linder et al. [415], Mackie and Bacskay
[416], and Li and Sarathy [417]. These three computational studies
directly addressed the kinetics of reaction R7 and were based on rela-
tively high-level electronic structure calculations; however, none of
these studies simultaneously implemented variational effects, torsional
anharmonicity effects, and the curvature of the reaction path while
estimating tunneling. Thus, the calculated rate constants can be further
refined using a more robust approach that implements all those effects.
As Mackie and Bacskay [416] used a lower level of theory without
variational, tunneling, and torsional anharmonicity effects, we are in-
clined to select the calculated rate constants by Linder et al. [415] and Li
and Sarathy [417], particularly those by the former who included
variational and torsional anharmonicity effects.

Reaction R8 is more complex, as the reactants NH2 and O can react
via two additional reaction channels besides hydrogen abstraction, i.e.,

NH2 + O â NO + H2

NH2 + O â HNO + H

(R14)

(R15)

The kinetic data for the three reaction channels R8, R14, and R15 are

uncertainties, particularly below 1000 K. However, the rate constants by
Klippenstein et al. [332], based on a higher level of theory that likely
more accurately predicted the energetics of the reaction, were in
excellent agreement with those reported by Sutherland et al. [409] and
Perry [407]. Therefore, these three sets of rate constants were selected
herein.

4.3.3. Chemical reactions of the amidogen radical

Amidogen (NH2) is a key radical

in ammonia oxidation and
decomposition, accumulated via reactions R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, and R6. It
can undergo various chemical reactions, i.e., hydrogen transfer re-
actions, association reactions, and dissociation by collision with a third
body. Herein, the experimental and theoretical rate constants available
in the literature for the reactions that rule the chemistry of this radical
are reviewed and compared.

NH2 can be involved in hydrogen transfer reactions with several

important species such as

NH2 + H â NH + H2

NH2 + O â NH + OH

NH2 + OH â NH + H2O

NH2 + HO2 â NH3 + O2

NH2 + HO2 â NH + H2O2

NH2 + NH â NH3 + N

Reaction R7 is highly sensitive under pyrolysis and rich-flame con-
ditions [217]. Numerous computational and experimental kinetic
studies have been conducted to determine rate constants, which are
shown in Fig. 18.

The rate constants proposed by Roose et al. [382] considerably un-
derestimate other measurements; moreover, they were derived indi-
rectly from a study on reverse reactions and are expected to be more
uncertain. Similarly, the theoretical calculations by Ischtwan et al. [411]
and Xu et al. [412] are relatively old and thus based on low-level elec-
tronic structure calculations that may not predict accurate barrier
heights. The rate constants derived by Samu et al. [398], which were
determined indirectly by reproducing laminar flat flame experiments
conducted by Rahinov et al. [413], show a negative temperature

lacking, particularly at high temperatures. In Fig. 19, the rate constants
available in the literature for the overall reaction, i.e., those that account
for the three reaction channels, are plotted. At temperatures of interest
during combustion, only the calculated rate constants by Sumathi et al.
[418] are available, who reported rate constants at 300â2000 K using
high-level electronic structure calculations at the CCSD(T)/6â311++G
(3df,3pd)//CCSD(T)/6â311++G(d,p) level of theory using the simple
QRRK kinetic theory. Sumathi et al. [418] did not estimate effects such
as torsional anharmonicity, tunneling, and variational effects; thus, their
rate constants may require further refinement. However, their values at
temperatures below 500 K were in good agreement with the experi-
mental values reported by Dransfeld et al. [419], Adamson et al. [420],
and Inomata and Washida [421] determined via discharge flow laser
magnetic resonance (LMR), infrared spectroscopy, and pulsed laser
photolysisâdischarge flow-photoionization mass spectrometer, respec-
tively, lying within the uncertainties estimated by the latter. In contrast,
the old flash photolysis in a discharge-flow reactor experiments by
Gehring et al. [422] yielded rate constants that were considerably lower
than all the other sets of data. This agreement at temperatures below
500 K between the computational work of Sumathi et al. [418] and the
relatively recent experimental measurements by Inomata and Washida

[421] indicate that both sets of rate constants may be accurate.

As for the branching ratios, which are pivotal in kinetic modeling,
Sumathi et al. [418] predicted that reactions R8, R14, and R15 are
equally important at room temperature. This is in contrast with the
experiments conducted by Dransfeld et al. [419], Adamson et al. [420],
and Inomata and Washida [421] who obtained branching ratios of 86.8
%, 92.3 %, and 91.6 %, respectively, for reaction R15. They attributed
the remaining contribution to the total flux to that of reaction R8 and
thus found a negligible contribution of the reaction channel R14.
Therefore, a more robust computational study that can accurately
discern between the three reaction channels at low and high tempera-
tures is necessary to fully understand the chemistry of the NH2 + O pair.
Reaction R9 has garnered considerable research interest, and its rate
constants have been determined in many studies (Fig. 20). However,
many of those rate constants were not directly measured; some were
derived by fitting the kinetic models so that they could reproduce
different experiments. This is the case of the experimental studies by
Dean et al. [194], Niemitz et al. [423], Miller et al. [313], Branch et al.
[424], Salimian et al. [188], and Kimball-Linne and Hanson [425] and
the numerical study conducted by Miller and Bowman [169]. The most
recent experimental kinetic study by Klippenstein et al. [332] also
measured the rate constants of reaction R9 as a secondary reaction in
their study on the thermal decomposition of NH2OH; however, it is not
based on a simple fitting and thus can be considered as the most reliable
experiment. Among the computational studies [208,332,396,416,417,
426,427], none of them used high-level electronic structure calculations
and implemented variational effects, torsional anharmonicity, and
multidimensional tunneling simultaneously. Thus, all these calculations
may need to be revisited. The calculated rate constants by Klippenstein
et al. [332] had to be fitted by adjusting down the high-level CCSD
(cid:0) 1 to
(T)/CBS//CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ barrier height by 2 kcal mol
reproduce the experiments. The rate constants calculated by Mousavi-
pour et al. [427] are also in good agreement with the experiments and
within the experimental uncertainties; however, they do not show the
negative temperature dependence predicted by Klippenstein et al.
[332], which is typical of reactions such as R9 with negative or nearly
zero barrier heights. Therefore, rate constants determined by Klippen-
stein et al. [332] at a wide temperature range are selected here, although
a more robust kinetic approach based on high-level electronic structure
calculations is desirable to resolve the observed discrepancies.

Another key chemical system in NH3 oxidation is NH2 + HO2, which
proceeds via different chemical pathways besides the hydrogen
abstraction reactions R10 and R11. Two additional chemical reactions
that the radicals NH2 and HO2 can undergo are

NH2 + HO2 â HNO + H2O

NH2 + HO2 â H2NO + OH

(R16)

(R17)

Reaction R16 is highly sensitive in the NO formation mechanism
[241], and reaction R17 has been reported as the RDS [196,428].
Despite the importance of the chemistry of the NH2 + HO2 reactive
system in NH3 oxidation and numerous experimental and computational
works addressing its kinetics, the rate constants of reactions R10, R11,
R16, and R17 and their corresponding branching ratios have not been
determined with high certainty yet.

Fig. 21 compares the rate constants of these reactions. As for reaction
R16, there is consensus on its minor role, as suggested by Pouchan et al.
[428] and Bozzelli and Dean [429]. The former characterized the po-
tential
the MCSF/4-31G*//SCF/4-31G* and
CI/4-31G*//SCF/4-31G* levels of theory and obtained barrier heights of
(cid:0) 1, respectively, indicating that reaction R16 is
57.8 and 68.6 kcal mol
not kinetically favored. The latter conducted a QRRK kinetic study on
the singlet ground-state PES of reaction R17 and found that this reaction
is the prominent reaction channel for the NH2 + HO2 chemical system.
Moreover, reaction R16 is not competitive at temperatures and pressures
of 200â1900 K and 0.001â10 atm. However, we infer from Bozzelli and

Deanâs work [429] that they used the low-level potential energy profile
developed by Pouchan et al. [428] for their kinetic study. This is suffi-
ciently accurate to assess the relative importance of the investigated
reactions but not for accurately determining their rate constants and
branching ratios.

Sumathi et al. [430] also performed a QRRK kinetic study based on

the QCISD
(T)/6â311++G(2df,2pd)//MP2/6â311++G** level of theory; however,
that level may not be sufficiently high to predict accurate barrier
heights. They also concluded that the dominant pathway is reaction R17
at 300â2000 K and 0.01â1000 atm. The rate constants determined by
Bozzelli and Dean [429] and Sumathi [430] for reaction R17 are nearly
temperature-independent, and their rate constants at 295 K agreed well
with the most recent flash photolysis experimental value reported by
Glarborg et al. [431]. Xiang et al. [432] conducted a computational
study using the CCSD(T)/6â311++G(3df,3pd)//B3LYP/6â311++G
(3df,3pd) level of theory and first suggested the importance of the
pathway corresponding to reaction R10, ruling out that of reaction R16.
Unfortunately, Xiang et al. [432] did not calculate the corresponding
rate constants, and their conclusions were based on their characteriza-
tion of the PES. Zhang et al. [433] performed VTST calculations with

are of the same order of magnitude as those calculated for reaction R17
by Bozzelli and Dean [429] and Sumathi et al. [430], supporting the
important role of reaction R10 and agreeing with the conclusions re-
ported by Xiang et al. [432].

However, these computational kinetic studies were not sufficiently
robust to draw definite conclusions on the relative importance of re-
actions R10 and R17 and determine accurate branching ratios for the
reaction between NH2 and HO2 radicals. Accurate branching ratios can
be obtained only using a high level of theory together with an appro-
priate kinetic approach that implements all the important effects that

Three computational studies on reaction R10 have been published
recently that may shed light on this question; they used higher levels of
theory for the electronic structure calculations and more robust kinetic
approaches. Stagni et al. characterized the PES of reaction R10 and its
reverse reaction R2 using the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ//M06â2X/aug-cc-
pVTZ level of theory and calculated their rate constants via VTST cal-
culations with torsional anharmonicity corrections [201]. Chavarrio
et al. [361] and Klippenstein and Glarborg [434] simultaneously pub-
lished theoretical kinetic studies more recently based on microcanonical
VTST calculations at the W3X-L//CCSD/cc-pVTZ and ANL0F levels of
CCSD
theory,
(T)-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 geometries and frequencies, which are more ac-
curate than those at the CCSD/cc-pVTZ level. However, the W3X-L
composite method highly accurately estimates energies corresponding
to the CCSDT(Q)/CBS limit. The zero-point energy corrected barrier
heights calculated by Stagni et al. [201], Chavarrio et al. [361], and
Klippenstein and Glarborg [434] are (cid:0) 4.20, (cid:0) 5.51, and (cid:0) 5.01 kcal
(cid:0) 1, respectively. Due to the relative importance of the multireference
mol
character of the saddle point of reaction R10 [434] with a T1 diagnostic
value of 0.050 [361,434], the quasi-perturbative quadruple excitations
(Q) of the coupled cluster wave function are required for accurately
estimating the barrier heights. Therefore, the barrier heights reported by
Chavarrio et al. [361] and Klippenstein and Glarborg [434] are expected
to be more accurate, and both are in fact in better agreement than that
calculated by Stagni et al. [201] who did not account for multi-reference
effects. This also affects the accuracy of the determined rate constants
[201] for reaction R2 (Section 4.3.1), as its saddle point is the same as
that of reaction R10. The CCSDT(Q) correction reported by Klippenstein

the agreement between the rate constants calculated for reaction R10 by
Stagni et al. [201] and Klippenstein and Glarborg [434] at temperatures
beyond 300 K and the agreement of the former ones with the experi-
mental estimation by Glarborg et al. [431] at 295 K is due to the missing
CCSDT(Q) corrections in Stagni et al.âs work [201].

This comparison also indicates that larger rate constants derived by
Chavarrio et al. [361] with respect to those reported by Klippenstein and
Glarborg [434], which are at most half an order of magnitude greater at
300 K, can be mainly attributed to the lower barrier height predicted by
using the electronic structure methods by Chavarrio et al. The difference

barrier height, the gap between both sets of rate constants is reduced,
resulting in a ratio of 3.2 at 2000 K while expecting differences of around
an order of magnitude at very low temperatures (i.e., below 200 K). The
three sets of compared rate constants also capture the non-Arrhenius
temperature dependence, typical of reactions with submerged barrier
heights. Note that the discrepancies between the rate constants reported
by Chavarrio et al. [361] and Klippenstein and Glarborg [434] can be
also partially attributed to the fact that Klippenstein and Glarborg
treated more accurately the bottleneck for the formation of the reactant
complex in the entry channel. This scenario was not considered by
Chavarrio et al. [361], which may have affected the reactivity at low
temperatures where largest discrepancies were observed. We therefore

select the rate constants reported by Chavarrio et al. [361] for reaction
R10 based on the level of theory used for the quantum chemistry cal-
culations, the kinetic approach, and their performance in our previous
jet stirred reactor, rapid compression machine and flow reactor simu-
lations [361]. The difference between these values was mainly attrib-
uted to the different levels of theory used, which predicted barrier
heights with a difference of 0.5 kcal mol

(cid:0) 1.

Unfortunately, the accuracy of the selected computational works
cannot be assessed because of the lack of experimental measurement.
Moreover, Cheskis [435] and Lozovskii [435], respectively, conducted
flash photolysis and intra-resonator laser spectroscopy experiments in
1979 to measure the overall reactivity of the NH2 and HO2 pair.
Furthermore, those experiments were not consistent with the most
robust kinetic calculations [361,434] as they predicted that the overall
rate constant for the pair was lower than those reported for reaction R10
[361,434]. Glarborg et al. [431] predicted via flash photolysis that the
rate constant for reaction R10 was between those reported by Chavarrio
et al. [361] and Klippenstein and Glarborg [434]. However, their rate
constants are expected to be uncertain. Finally, Klippenstein and Glar-
borg [434] recently reported the rate constants for reaction R17, which
did not agree with Glarborg et al.âs findings [431]; the discrepancies
were slightly larger than one order of magnitude. Therefore, most recent
experiments and robust calculations have concluded that the reaction
channel R10 is much more prominent than R17 for NH2 + HO2 reaction
and R16 and R17 are unimportant [361,431,434]; however, un-
certainties still exist in the determined rate constants.

Reactions R10 and R17 occur on their triplet and singlet electronic
ground states, respectively. However, they can occur on their singlet and
triplet electronic excited states, respectively. Chavarrio et al. [361]
calculated the rate constants for both electronically excited states and
found that they are not competitive even at very high temperatures.
They reported a yield for singlet-excited O2(1 Îg) of 0.4 % even at 3000
K (purple line in right y-axis of Fig. 21 (b)) and a very low yield of triplet
excited H2NO (red line in right y-axis of Fig. 21a).

The reaction between NH2 radicals is important in NH3 pyrolysis,
similar to that between NH2 and HO2 radicals that proceeds via alter-
native channels to the hydrogen abstraction, as represented by R12.
Klippenstein et al. clarified this reaction by characterizing the PESs of
hydrogen abstraction (R12) and H2 and H elimination pathways at the
CCSD(T)/CBS//CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ high level of theory. They also
calculated the corresponding rate constants via master equation calcu-
lations using tunneling and torsional anharmonicity corrections [332].
The H2 and H elimination pathways are represented as follows:

NH2 + NH2 â HNNH + H2

NH2 + NH2 â H2NN + H2

NH2 + NH2 â NH3 + NH

(R18)

(R19)

(R20)

Klippenstein et al. also calculated the rate constants for NH2

association:

NH2 + NH2âN2H4

(R21)

For this calculation, they used the more appropriate variable reac-
tion coordinate formulation of the VTST [332]. Fig. 22 compares their
high-pressure limit rate constants [332] with those obtained from
different experimental measurements [436â442] at limited temperature
ranges. Khe et al. [436] showed that the high-pressure limit for reaction
R21 was ~1.3 atm of N2. Although most of the experimental rate con-
stants at low temperatures are scattered, they do not differ by more than
one order of magnitude and agreed well with those determined by
Klippenstein et al. [332], particularly those by Sarkisov et al. [442] and
Gordon et al. [439] at low temperatures and Diesen [437] at high
temperatures. Klippensteinâs et al. [332] rate constants were thus
selected herein as they are based on a robust theoretical approach and
match the scattered experimental values at low and high temperatures;

temperature. Calculations and measurements are indicated as lines and dots,
respectively.

they are also within the uncertainty levels reported by Back et al. [441].
Fig. 22 compares the rate constants for reactions R12, R18, and R19
calculated by Klippenstein et al. [332] with those derived experimen-
tally and calculated by Xu et al. [443] for reaction R12 using the VTST
theory and the QCISD(T)/6-311G(d,p)//MP2/6-311G(d,p) level of the-
ory. The experimental measurements at limited temperatures with low
error margins and the calculated values within broad temperature
ranges agree well for reaction R12. However, Klippenstein et al. [332]
used a higher level of theory for the electronic structure calculations
than Xu et al. [443]; therefore, their rate constants, which agree well
with those derived by Davidson, were selected herein.

As for the other three pathways, i.e., the H2 and H elimination re-
actions R20, R21, and R22, the rate constants for reactions R20 and R21
determined by Klippenstein et al. are considerably lower than that for
hydrogen abstraction reaction R12 [332]. Reaction R22 can be also
considered as unimportant based on the barrier heights and heats of
reaction calculated by Klippenstein et al. [332].

The amidogen radical can also react with the imidogen radical, NH,
via the hydrogen abstraction reaction R13 and by abstracting its N atom
to yield HNNH:

NH2 + NH â HNNH + H

(R22)

Reaction R22 proceeds on the doublet PES via an HNNH2 adduct.
Klippenstein et al. investigated reactions R13 and R22 and found that
the latter was kinetically favored within 200â2500 K with slight tem-
perature dependence even at 2500 K [332]. Their calculated rate con-
stants using CCSD(T)/CBS//CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ high-level electronic

and torsional anharmonicity corrections are plotted in Fig. 23, together
with experimental measurements [419,444] and estimations [185,440,
445]. The scarce experimental measurements with relatively large un-
certainties and estimations performed to fit kinetic models agree well
with the values calculated by Klippenstein et al. [332]. The differences
are below one order of magnitude; therefore, Klippenstein et al.âs rate
constants [332] were selected.

Based on Klippenstein et al.âs study, we derived branching ratios of
4.0 % for reaction R13 even at 2500 K. This indicates that radicals NH2
and NH primarily react via association on the doublet PES (R22) [332].
However, Klippenstein et al. also suggested that the adduct HNNH2
formed during reaction R22 may also undergo H2 elimination, but such a
saddle point was not found [332]. Further calculations are required to
elucidate this finding and confirm the abovementioned branching ratios.
Finally, NH2 can be also decomposed into NH by collisions with a

third body:

NH2 + MâNH + H + M

(R23)

(cid:0) 1 s

Reaction R23 has not been studied theoretically. To the best of our
knowledge, only Deppe et al. measured its rate constants at 2200â4000
K and found that it was not competitive in NH2 decomposition even at
(cid:0) 15 cm3
temperatures as high as 3000 K, with a rate constant of 5.78â10
(cid:0) 1 [446]. They also found that the competitive dissociation
mol
channel that yields the products N and H2 is of minor importance [446].
Glarborg et al. [350] relied on the measurements of Deppe et al. and
implemented in their model the reverse of reaction R23, whose rate
constants were derived by detailed balance using the forward rate
constants obtained by Deppe et al. Moreover, Glarborg et al. [350]
extrapolated their rate constants for the reverse of R23 to lower tem-
peratures since Deppe et al. measured those for the forward reaction at
temperatures no lower than 2200 K. We cannot assess the uncertainty of
those rate constants determined by Glarborg et al. for reaction R23 at
temperatures below 2200 K since no further details were provided, but it
is expected to negligibly impact the performance of ammonia kinetic
models because R23 is only important at very high temperatures. Given
that Glarborg et al. rate constants cover a wider temperature range than
Deppe et al. while reproduce very well the measurements of the latter
within the 2200â4000 K temperature range, the rate expression derived
by Glarborg et al. [350] from Deppe et al. measurements was selected for
reaction R23, and its reverse reaction was implemented in the present
model.

theory than the

Mebel et al. [447] and Xu and Lin [448] calculated rate constants for
reaction R24 using VTST. The latter based their calculations on a higher
i.e., CCSD(T)/6-311+G(3df,
former,
level of
2p)//CCSD/6â311++G(d,p) and G2 levels of theory, respectively. They
predicted different barrier heights that caused differences of up to one
order of magnitude in their rate constants plotted in Fig. 24. Dean et al.
also estimated the rate constants of reaction R24 in their kinetic
mechanism for NH3 oxidation but predicted considerably larger values
[194]. The rate constants from both calculations [447,448] were in
relative good agreement, and a non-Arrhenius temperature dependence
was predicted that is typical of reactions with very low or submerged
barriers. This finding was consistent with their electronic structure
calculations. We consider the rate constants determined by Xu and Lin
[448] as more accurate as they used a higher level of theory.

Xu and Lin also calculated the rate constants of the other competing
pathway, i.e., reaction R25, using the same methodology and level of
theory as R24 [448]. This reaction proceeds via an intermediate
H2NNOH that can decompose by releasing an H atom. Their calculated
rate constants in the high-pressure limit and at 1 atm are also shown in
Fig. 24, indicating little pressure dependence and a minor importance
than reaction R24, although not insignificant at intermediate and high
temperatures.

NH3 combustion as it can eventually be converted into NOx [196,449]. It
can also undergo hydrogen abstraction by the species NH2 as follows:

NH2 + H2NO â HNO + NH3

(R26)

To the best of our knowledge, the kinetics of reaction R26 was
investigated theoretically only by Stagni and Cavallotti. They developed
a master equation based on high-level electronic structure calculations
using the CASPT2 method and obtained the modified Arrhenius
expression 9.49â1012 T

(cid:0) 0.08exp1644/(RT) (cm, cal, mol, K) [449].

The reaction of NH2 with nitric oxide (NO) can proceed via the

following pathways:

NH2 + NO â NNH + OH

NH2 + NO â N2 + H2O

(R27)

(R28)

These reactions are vital in ammonia oxidation as they controls NO
removal. Reactions R27 and R28 are highly sensitive in pure ammonia
combustion at different operating conditions as they are crucial chain-
branching and chain-termination reactions, respectively, [196,217,
282]. To the best of our knowledge, only one computational study based
on RKKM calculations has been conducted by Diau et al. [450]. They
used Walchâs [451] PES data from internally contracted configuration
interaction calculations and observed no pressure effects. Their rate
constants are plotted in Fig. 25 for both reaction pathways. Although
this study is based on relatively low electronic structure calculations and
did not implement a robust kinetic approach with torsional anharmo-
nicity and tunneling effects, their rate constants for reaction R27 agree
well with the experimental values reported by Song et al. [452] using
STs, as opposed to the rate constants for reaction R28 that considerably
increase with increasing temperature. Park and Lin [453] conducted

laser photolysis experiments and obtained rate constants for the overall
reaction. Their experiments were in very good agreement with the STs
experiments conducted by Song et al. [452]. Moreover, Diau et al. [450]
used the cavity-ring-down technique to monitor the disappearance of
the NH2 radical and calculated rate constants for the overall reaction
that are in very good agreement with those determined by Song et al.
[452] and Park and Lin [453].

Song et al. could discern between the two reaction pathways R27 and
R28 whose rate constants are shown in Fig. 25 [452]. Their rate con-
stants for reaction R27 were supported by Diau et al.âs calculations [450]
and Miller and Glarborgâs [314] and Klippenstein et al.âs estimations
[315]. Similar consensus was observed in the rate constants measured
for another reaction pathway R28 by Song et al. [452] and the estima-
tions by other authors [314,315,454]. The exception is that the rate
constants calculated by Diau et al. [450] significantly overestimate the
reported values at temperatures beyond 1000 K.

Therefore, we conclude that the rate constants obtained via ST ex-
periments conducted by Song et al. [452] for reactions R27 and R28 are
the most accurate with low uncertainties. However, we also believe that
a sophisticated computational kinetic study based on high level elec-
tronic structure calculations will be helpful to corroborate those ST
experiments and the corresponding branching ratios.

Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is another highly reactive nitrogen oxide that
can react with NH2. The reaction between NH2 and NO2 is one of the
most important sinks of NO2 in NH3 oxidation, justifying its importance
[258â260]. These species can react via five possible reaction channels:

NH2 + NO2 â N2O + H2O

NH2 + NO2 â H2NO + NO

NH2 + NO2 â N2 + H2O2

NH2 + NO2 â N2 + 2OH

NH2 + NO2â2HNO

Although these reactions are thermodynamically favored, ab initio
calculations at the QCISD(T)/6-311G(d,p)//MP2/6-311G(d,p) + ZPC
[MP2/6-311G(d,p)] and G2 levels by Mebel et al. suggested that re-
actions R29 and R30 are the most thermodynamically and/or kinetically
favored [455]. Those calculations also indicated that reactions R29,
R30, R31, R32, and R33 proceeded via complex PESs with several re-
action intermediates. Two important intermediates, i.e., H2NNO2 and
H2NONO, in those PESs drive the reactants to form N2O + H2O and
H2NO + NO pairs of products, respectively. Klippenstein et al. [456] also
characterized the PES of NH2 + NO2 using higher levels of theory and
calculated rate constants using the master equation and VRC-TST cal-
culations for different channels. They concluded that Mebel et al. [455]
may have mistakenly assigned one of their transition states to the
connection of the intermediates H2NNO2 and H2NONO. Instead, Klip-
penstein et al. [456] explored an alternative connecting pathway be-
tween the two reaction intermediates using multireference methods and
confirmed that they were connected via a roaming mechanism that
proceeds through a transition state with considerably higher energy
than that suggested by Mebel et al. [455]. The rate constants calculated
by Klippenstein et al. were tuned to reproduce the experimentally
derived branching ratios with more fidelity; these values are plotted in
Fig. 26 [456]. The overall rate constants determined theoretically and
experimentally agree well with each other [453,457â461], except for
those derived experimentally by Meunier et al. [462] and Hack et al.
[463] that are considerable lower than the other rate constants. The rate
constants calculated by Klippenstein et al. for the overall reaction at
300â2000 K are between those measured in several experiments at a
common temperature range; therefore, they are used herein because
they were derived via high-level quantum chemistry calculations and an
appropriate kinetic theory [456]. Consequently, the rate constants

Reaction R34, specifically occurring on the ground electronic state
that yields ground-state nitrogen atoms N(4S), has been widely investi-
gated theoretically via direct dynamic studies using the transition state
theory and via quasiclassical trajectory (QCT) and quantum scattering
dynamics (QM) calculations. Moreover, its kinetics has been widely
studied experimentally, resulting in well stablished and certain rate
constants (Fig. 27).

Except for the calculated values by Mayer and Schieler, all the
measured and calculated rate constants were in good agreement [464].
Mayer and Schieler overestimated values because they used the transi-
tion state theory with no variational effects and an estimated barrier
height with no quantum chemistry calculations [464]. The most accu-
(cid:0) 1, as determined by Zhai et al. using
rate barrier height is 1.84 kcal mol
the-high level MRCI/aug-cc-pV5Z [465]. Therefore, the microcanonical
formulation of the transition state theory used by Zhang and Truong
[466] is crucial to accurately estimate the rate constants. They obtained
(cid:0) 1 at a relatively high level of theory, i.
a barrier height of 2.17 kcal mol
e., QCISD(TQ)/cc-pVTZ, which is in very good agreement with that re-
ported by Zhai et al. [465]. Therefore, we believe that among the three
direct dynamic studies by Zhang and Truong [466], Xu et al. [467], and

calculated by Klippenstein et al. for reaction channels R29 and R30 were
selected here. The rate constant for R30 was in good agreement with
those estimated by Glarborg et al. [260].

The rate constants of the NH2 + NO2 system were pressure-
independent [459,460]. Klippenstein et al. predicted slightly pressure
dependence for pressures below 100 atm due to the too short lifetimes of
the intermediates [456]. Moreover, in agreement with the computa-
tional studies by Mebel et al. [455] and Klippenstein et al. [456], some
studies [260,453,462] also reported that reactions R29 and R30 control
the chemistry of the NH2 + NO2 system. Although the experimental
values for the overall reaction obtained by Bulatov et al. [461] show low
uncertainties, those estimated by Glarborg et al. [260] for reaction R30
show much larger error limits. The rate constants chosen here are within
these limits.

4.3.4. Chemical reactions of the imidogen radical

The imidogen radical, whose most important electronic state is the
triplet ground state 3NH (hereafter just NH), is mainly formed during
ammonia oxidation and pyrolysis by hydrogen abstraction from NH2.
The important reactions ruling its decomposition and transformation are
as follows:

NH + H â N + H2

NH + O â OH + N

NH + O â NO + H

NH + OH â HNO + H

NH + OH â N + H2O

Pascual et al. [468], that by Zhang and Truong reports the most accurate
rate constant. This is because Xu et al. and Pascual et al. did not use the
microcanonical version of the transition state theory to calculate the rate
constant.

The QCT method can yield accurate rate constants when quantum
effects such as tunneling, resonances, and zero-point energy are not
important and as long as the PES used for those QCT calculations is
accurately described using high-level electronic structure calculations.
Adam et al. [469] and Han et al. [470] conducted QCTs calculations
using a PES fitted to higher-level electronic structure calculations than
those by Pascual et al. [468], i.e., MRCI/aug-cc-pVQZ, MRCI/FVCAS
and MCQDPT2//FORS-MCSCF(7,6)/6â311++G**, respectively, where
FVCAS stands for full-valence complete active space. Furthermore, the
ab initio energies used by Han et al. in their PES were semi-empirically
corrected using the double many-body expansion scaled external cor-
relation (DMBE-SEC) method to account for excitations beyond singles
and doubles as well as for the incompleteness of the one-electron basis
set [470]. Han et al. [470] reported that the DMBE strategy can improve
the description of the long range regions of PES, which plays a vital role
in the kinetics and dynamics of reactions with low barriers at low
collision energies and temperature regimes. They determined the rate
constant at 298 K, which agreed well with that reported by Adam et al.
in their laser-flash photolysis experiments [469]. This may explain the
larger differences in rate constants determined via QCT calculations by
Adam et al. [469] and Han et al. [470] at low temperatures. The
as-calculated rate constants decreased with increasing temperature.
Among the three quantum dynamics calculations performed for reaction
R34 [465,471,472], only Yang et al. [472] conducted a full-dimensional
study. As these calculations are performed using time-dependent
quantum wave-packet methods based on the same high-level PES built
by Zhai et al. [465], the rate constants reported by Yang et al. [472] are
expected to be the most accurate ones. These quantum dynamic calcu-
lations can improve the predictions of their QCT counterpart methods by
accounting for quantum effects; therefore, we used the rate constants
calculated by Yang et al. [472]. These values also agreed well with those
estimated by Morley [473] in his acetonitrile-doped H2âO2 flame ex-
periments at high temperatures as well as with that determined by Adam
et al. at 298 K [469].

The reaction of the NH radical with O atoms is complex because it
can proceed via two channels, i.e., reactions R35 and R36, and both
reactions can take place on different PESs that arise from different ori-
entations of the singly occupied orbitals of the O(3P) atoms relative to
the NH radical. Reaction R35 can occur on the 3AÊ¹Ê¹ PES, whereas reac-
tion R36 can proceed on the 1AÊ¹, 3AÊ¹Ê¹, and 1AÊ¹Ê¹ PESs [474]. In a
computational
study based on TST and complete active space
self-consistent field (CASSCF) calculations, Walch calculated rate con-
stants for reaction R35. These values were significantly lower than other
values compared in Fig. 28 at low and intermediate temperatures
because a low level of theory was used for their calculations [475]. Hack
and Wilms indirectly measured the rate constant for reaction R35 via
laser flash photolysis at room temperature and provided a possibly
inaccurate estimation as it corresponded to an indirect measurement
[476]. Guadagnini et al. [474] used the QCT method and their own
relatively high-level PES, built with 800 CASSCF/ICCI ab initio points
and the cc-pVTZ basis set [474], to calculate rate constants. To the best
of our knowledge, it was the first robust study that considered the
multiple PESs on which reactions R35 and R36 could occur. Guadagnini
et al. [474] reported rate constants at a wide temperature range and
reported that the value determined at room temperature agreed well
with that calculated by Li et al. [75] using more robust quantum dy-
namics wave packet calculations and an improved and more accurate
PES with a larger number of points fitted to very-high level
MRCI/aug-cc-pVQZ calculations. Li et al. also considered multiple PESs
involved in reactions R35 and R36; therefore, their rate constant
determined at room temperature is considered the benchmark [75].
Fortunately, the values obtained by Guadagnini et al. [474] for reaction

Fig. 29. Rate constants of reactions R37 (yielding HNO + H: red and blue lines
and pink points) and R38 (yielding N + H2O: green and black lines) as a
function of temperature. Calculations and measurements are indicated as lines
and dots, respectively.

R36 within a broad temperature range are also in excellent agreement
with those obtained using quantum dynamics calculations [75]; there-
fore, these values were selected herein. The calculated rate constants by
Guadagnini et al. [474] and Li et al. [75] for reaction R36 are supported
by the laser fluorescence experiments conducted by Huang and Dag-
digian [477], wherein rate constants were measured directly.

By comparing the rate constants of R35 and R36, we conclude that
the reaction between the NH radical and O atom proceeds almost
exclusively via the reaction channel R36 that yields NO + H products.
Fig. 28 also compares the overall rate constant, i.e., of both reaction
channels. The overall rate constant determined by Guadagnini et al.
[474] and Li et al. [75] agree well with those determined at room
temperature by Dransfeld et al. [419] and Adamson et al. [420] based on
discharge flow and infrared kinetics spectroscopy experiments, respec-
tively. Wang et al. [478] calculated the overall rate constant via quan-
tum dynamic calculations using the same PES as Guadagnini et al. [474],
and Mertens et al. [479] obtained the rate constant by conducting ST
experiments. However, the former significantly underestimated the rate
constants reported by Guadagnini et al. [474] and Li et al. [75] because
they only considered the 1AÊ¹ PES. These values were below the uncer-
tainty limits of the experimental values determined by Dransfeld et al.
[419] and Adamson et al. [420]. The rate constants were overestimated
in the ST experiments, probably because Mertens et al. assumed N2O
third-body decomposition as the only source of O atoms.

Several reaction pathways have been characterized for the reactions
between NH and OH radicals, resulting in a complex PES with multiple
possible sets of products [332]. However, in their detailed computa-
tional kinetic study based on master equation calculations using a PES
characterized with the high-level CCSD(T)/CBS//CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ
theory, Klippenstein et al. reported R37 as the dominant reaction
channel, which yielded HNO + H. However, reaction R38 became
competitive as the temperature increased [332]. In contrast, master
equation calculations by Sumathi et al. based on the CCSD
(T)/6â311++G(3df,3pd)//CCSD(T)/6â311++G(d,p)
level of
theory predicted that
the reaction pathways R37 and R38 were
competitive within 200â2000 K; R38 was slightly dominant only at
temperatures below 300 K [418]. Their calculated rate constants are
compared in Fig. 29, including the value estimated by Hack and Kurzke
at 295 K in their discharge flow experiments conducted for investigating
reaction R37 [480]. As Klippenstein et al. [332] used a higher level of
theory than Sumathi et al. [418] and treated barrierless radicalâradical
reactions with the more appropriate variable reaction coordinate
formulation, we are inclined to selecting their rate constants. Moreover,
they reproduced the rate constant value estimated by Hack and Kurzke

at 295 K in their experiments [480].

The reaction between the NH and O2 species is complicated because
different possible reaction channels, such as R40, R41, and R42, yield
different products connected by different bonded intermediates. These
reaction channels are expected to have different prominences depending
on temperature and pressure. In their computational study, Melius et al.
did not calculate rate constants but concluded, based on their PES
exploration with the low level MP4/6-31G**, that reactions R40 and
R41 are more likely to be prominent at high and low temperatures,
respectively [481]. The RRKM calculations by Miller and Melius et al.
based on MP4 calculations, but with semiempirical bond additivity
corrections, confirmed those predictions. They concluded that beyond
1200 K, reaction R40 surpasses reaction R41 [482]. Hennig et al.
experimentally determined the rate constants for reactions R40 and R41
by monitoring NH and OH concentration profiles and verified that the
former is faster than the latter only at temperatures beyond 1100 K
[483]. Romming and Wagnerâs ST experiments could not fully discern
between the different channels and only reported with certainty the rate
constants of reaction R41 [484]. In their theoretical work, Talipov et al.
RI-MR-CISD(18,13)+Q/aug-cc-pVTZ//CASSCF(18,
used
13)/6-311+G(d,p) level of theory and the RRKM method to calculate
rate constants and found that reaction R41 is the dominant channel at
temperatures up to 1600 K. They also reported that below 330 K, the
intermediate HNOO formed via reaction R42 remains stabilized
(Fig. 30) [485]. Talipov et al. reported that reaction R41 proceeds via an
intramolecular hydrogen transfer reaction that converts the intermedi-
ate HNOO into NOOH. The intermediate can undergo OâO dissociation
to form NO and OH [485]. The rate constants determined for reaction
R41 experimentally and theoretically are in good agreement, except
those calculated by Talipov et al. [485]. They severely underestimated
rate constant at low temperatures, with values well below the un-
certainties reported by Romming and Wagner via ST experiments [484].
The rate constants of reaction R40 were in good agreement between the
three compared sets of data at temperatures beyond 1000 K. However, at
lower temperatures, rate constants calculated by Talipov et al. signifi-
cantly underestimated the two other sets of rate constants [485]. With
some differences in their branching ratios, the channel-specific rate

the

constants determined by Miller and Melius [482], Hennig et al. [483],
and Romming and Wagner [484] yield overall rate constants that are in
excellent agreement with those measured in other experiments, in which
the reaction channels R40, R41, and R42 were not discerned [440,479,
486,487].

Two more experimental and theoretical determinations of the rate
constants of reaction R41 have been reported. In their mass spectrom-
etry experiments with NH3/O2 and H2/O2/NH3 flames, Bian et al. [237,
293] obtained rate constants that were considerably larger than those
previously discussed. However, the rate constants determined in their
latter study [293] were in good agreement with those calculated by
Fueno et al. [488] using the UHF SCF/MC SCF/6-31G** low level of
theory. Both sets of rate constants reported by Bian et al. were deduced
using some assumptions on the formation of NO in their experiments and
are thus likely inaccurate [237,293]. Therefore, we believe that the
experimental rate constants calculated by Romming and Wagner [484],
Hennig et al. [483], and Miller and Melius [482] should be preferred.
However, the reported calculations would be further improved by using

lations and measurements are indicated as lines and dots, respectively.

higher levels of theory for exploring the PES of the NH + O2 chemical
system and by determining the effect of pressure that may affect the
stabilization of intermediates HNOO and NOOH and the branching ra-
tios. Furthermore, none of the reported theoretical studies used robust
methods for estimating the tunneling effect, which is hypothesized to be
highly pronounced in the isomerization of HNOO into NOOH. This is
because that reaction has a large barrier height and implies a
heavy-light-heavy atom configuration [485]. Such features of the PES
can enhance the tunneling effect at low and intermediate temperatures
[489] and thus affect the branching ratios for reactions R40, R41, and
R42.

4.3.5. Chemistry of nitrogen oxides

Nitrogen oxides (NOx), i.e., nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide
(NO2), and nitrous oxide (N2O), are poisonous species formed during
combustion processes that use air as the oxidizer. NOx contribute to acid
rain and photochemical smog, and therefore, a hazard that requires
emission regulation. NOx emissions are particularly concerning in NH3
oxidation as NH2 and NH radicals are also a source of NO and N2O
formed via reactions such as R14, R24, R36, R39, and R41. Therefore,
their degradation and formation pathways in NH3 oxidation must be
determined to control the impact of NH3-based fuels on power genera-
tion. Herein, we review the kinetics of the following reactions that,
together with others reviewed in previous sections, control NO and NO2
decomposition:

NO + HO2 â NO2 + OH

NO + NH â N2O + H

Reaction R43 oxidizes NO into NO2 and simultaneously converts
HO2 into the more reactive species OH. This reaction is very sensitive in
NH3 oxidation at low temperatures and lean conditions. To the best of
our knowledge, no robust computational studies have reported accurate
rate constants for reaction R43. In their computational study, Zhao et al.
performed TST calculations with anharmonic corrections based on a PES
characterized with the B3LYP/6â311++G** low level of theory. The
resulting rate constants are plotted in Fig. 31 (right y-axis). They,
however, did not report the existence of any bounded intermediate in
the PES of reaction R43 and instead reported a tight transition state
[490]. They did not refer to tunneling and pressure effects as well. In
contrast, Bardwell et al. conducted turbulent flow experiments and
concluded that reaction R43 proceeds by forming an HO2NO interme-
diate due to the observed negative temperature dependence of their rate
constants. They did not observe pressure effects in the pressure range of
0.1â0.29 atm and thus deduced that the intermediate is short-lived
[491]. Although the rate constants measured by Bardwell et al. [491]
were considerably different than those calculated by Zhao et al. [490],
they agreed well with those measured by Seeley et al. [492] using the
turbulent flow technique at 0.1â0.25 atm; Seeley et al. did not report any
pressure effects. Bohn and Zetzsch [493,494] and Jemi-Alade and
Thrush [495] experimentally determined the rate constants during the
pulsed production of OH and for a discharge flow system, respectively.
These values were pressure-independent at pressures below 1 atm and
agreed well with those determined by Bardwell et al. [491] and Seeley
et al. [492], which prevented the stabilization of the possible HO2NO
intermediate. Leu et al. determined the rate constants in a discharge
flow/mass spectrometer/resonance apparatus at a wide temperature
range and very low pressures (0.003â0.007 atm). The values agreed well
with those determined experimentally [496]. Furthermore, Carleton
measured the rate constants at higher temperatures via the laser mag-
netic resonance detection of HO2 and OH in a flow tube reactor and
obtained rate constants that agreed well with those obtained experi-
mentally, confirming the non-Arrhenius kinetics [497]. Recently,
Kovacs et al. derived new rate constants to reproduce experimental data
obtained from the literature such as ignition delay times, laminar
burning velocities, and species profiles. They obtained considerably
lower rate constants with non-Arrhenius behavior [498]. As the six sets
of experimental rate constants agree well with each other and Carletonâs
experiments covered a broader temperature range, their rate constants
with low uncertainties were selected [497]. However, although there is
consensus on the non-pressure dependency of the rate constants, the
little stabilization of the intermediate HO2NO, and the non-Arrhenius
kinetics, a detailed and robust computational study within broader
temperature and pressure ranges would be helpful.

The reaction between NO and NH species have a complex topology
with three different reaction channels, i.e., reactions R44, R45, and R46.
Several works, including theory and experiments, have addressed their
kinetics. The reported rate constants, plotted in Fig. 32, are in relatively
good agreement with a negative temperature dependence consistent
with the presence of a reaction intermediate.

The only computational study reporting overall rate constants in a
broad temperature range is Klippenstein et al.âs, who aimed to under-
stand the chemistry of NNH species as a key intermediate in thermal
DeNOx [315]. To accurately describe the barrierless entrance channel of
the reaction of NH and NO species, they used the VRC-TST theory for
deriving a master equation based on high level CASPT2(7e,
6o)/aug-cc-pVDZ electronic structure calculations. Their calculations
resulted in pressure-independent rate constants with relatively good
agreement with the results reported by Lillich et al. [499] and Romming
et al. [484] in laser photolysis/laser-induced fluorescence pump-probe
and reflected incident shock waves experiments, respectively, at a

narrower temperature range. Geiger et al. [500], Satoru et al. [501],
Harrison et al. [502], and Hack et al. [476] determined the rate con-
stants using different experimental techniques at low pressures and
temperatures, which were also in good agreement with those reported
by Klippenstein et al. [315]. The shock wave experiments by Mertens
et al. resulted in rate constants with relatively large uncertainties, which
were considerably different than the other works reported in the liter-
ature. They predicted a positive temperature dependence of the rate
constants that was not consistent with the presence of an intermediate,
as predicted by most other studies [479].

The rate constants calculated by Klippenstein et al. for different
channels prominent in NO + NH reaction are plotted in Fig. 32 [315].
Although they did not reach temperatures as low as those reported in
Satoruâs experiments [501], an extrapolation of Klippenstein et al. [315]
rate constants to lower temperatures facilitated their good agreement.
Thus, the set of rate constants calculated by Klippenstein et al. [315] is
the one that best describes the kinetics of reactions R44-R45 and R46.
This is because it was determined using appropriate methods, well
supported by several experiments, and derived at a broad temperature
range that is of interest for practical applications.

The chemistry of H2NO is also crucial for NH3 oxidation at low and
intermediate temperatures [322], particularly because it is a precursor
of NOx [196,449]. H2NO can be also consumed by other hydrogen
abstraction reactions besides R26 such as

H2NO + O2 â HNO + HO2

H2NO + HO2 â HNO + H2O2

H2NO + NO2 â HNO + HONO

H2NO + NO â HNO + HNO

H2NO + H â HNO + H2

Reactions R47-R51 pose some challenges from the computational
point view due to the large multi-reference character of their saddle
points that is caused by the different spin states of the corresponding
reactants and products.

R47 is a chain-propagation reaction vital under lean [315,429] and
high pressure conditions [196]. Miller and Glarborg first tried to esti-
mate the rate constants of reaction R47 for their model developed for the
thermal De-NOx process; however, they did not calculate the values
[314]. Song et al. calculated the rate constants using the UCCSD
(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ//UQCISD/6-311G(d,p) level and the canonical VTST;
however, to our understanding, they did not implement torsional
anharmonicity and consider the distinguishable conformer of the saddle
point [196]. Glarborg et al. reduced the activation energy reported by

(cid:0) 1 to improve the performance of their kinetic
Song et al. by 2.5 kcal mol
model, highlighting the uncertainty in those calculated rate constants
[170]. In a more recent study, Chavarrio et al. calculated the rate con-
stants of reaction R47 using a more robust approach that implemented
torsional and multistructural anharmonicity [361]. Chavarrio et al. also
used a very high level of theory, i.e., W3X-L//ROCCSD/cc-pVTZ, which
was expected to yield a more accurate barrier height. Chavarrio et al.
suggested large spin-contamination and some multireference character
in the wave function of the corresponding saddle point, justifying the
need to define a restricted open-shell wave function and the use of
W3X-L method to handle the mild multireference character of the saddle
point with a T1 diagnostic value of 0.048 [361]. They also found a
(cid:0) 1
second conformer for the saddle point species that was 1.73 kcal mol
above the global minimum and was missed by Song et al. [170]. In line
with those findings, Stagni and Cavallotti also reported some
multi-reference character in the saddle point of reaction R47 and used
the high-level CASPT2/aug-cc-pVTZ theory to conduct their kinetic
study based on the VTST with torsional anharmonicity corrections.
However, they did not consider the effect of multiple conformers of the
saddle point [449]. These four sets of calculated rate constants of re-
action R47 are compared in Fig. 33.

The effect on the rate constant of the larger barrier height by Song
et al. [196] compared to that by Chavarrio et al. [361] is more evident at
low temperatures. Chavarrio et al. [361] and Stagni and Cavallotti [449]
used a higher level of theory to more accurately address the low
multi-reference character of the saddle point, obtaining lower barrier
heights and thus larger rate constants. The estimated rate constants by
Glarborg et al. [170] are in excellent agreement with those calculated by
Stagni and Cavallotti in the whole temperature range and Chavarrio
et al. only at temperatures below 900 K. As the temperature increased,
the rate constants determined by Chavarrio et al. underestimated those
determined by Glarborg and Stagni. Chavarrio et al. justified these
findings based on the effect of torsional anharmonicity that hinders
reactivity at high temperatures. Although Stagni and Cavallotti sug-
gested that their treatment of anharmonicity (strongly linked to the
umbrella motion of the H2NO species) and low quality of the vibrational
frequencies predicted by the CASPT2 method can be responsible for
some uncertainties in their rate constants, their study is supported by
Glarborgâs estimations. It suggests that Chavarrio et al. rate constants
may become underestimated as temperature increases. Unfortunately,
no direct experimental measurement methods are available to confirm
the high-temperature trends of rate constants calculated by Chavarrio
et al. and Stagni and Cavallotti.

The rate constants of reactions R48 and R49 were calculated in only
one theoretical work by Stagni and Cavallotti. They used a methodology
similar to that discussed for reaction R47; thus, the uncertainty can be
attributed to the same sources discussed by the authors [449]. More-
over, additional conformers of the saddle point of those reactions can be
present on their PESs (similarly to reaction R47, which even has a more
reduced conformational space), which would have not been as accu-
rately described by the 1D hindered rotor model used in the work by
Stagni and Cavallotti as by the multi-structural torsional anharmonicity
method used in Ref. [361]; the 1D hindered rotor model would intro-
duce further uncertainty in the rate constants for reactions R48 and R49
by Stagni and Cavallotti in the scenario that torsions are strongly mixed,
as it is the case of the saddle point of reaction R47 [361]. Their calcu-
lated rate constants were fitted to the expression k = ATn exp(-Ea/RT),
(cid:0) 1, n = 2.16, and Ea =

Finally, the kinetics of the reactions R50 and R51 have not been
addressed neither theoretically nor experimentally. Given their impor-
tance as NOx precursors, more efforts will be required to accurately
determine their rate constants and improve kinetic models.

The collision-induced dissociation of HNO,

i.e., reaction R52,
improved the experimental predictions on NOx emissions by kinetics
models [78]. Stagni et al.âs computational study tackled the kinetics of
this reaction using the VTST with torsional anharmonicity corrections at
the CASPT2/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory [201]. Their unimolecular rate
constants are plotted in panel (a) of Fig. 34 at different pressures, for
which they used a similar temperature dependence definition for ÎEdown
to that of reaction R1 (see the discussion in Section 4.3.1). Radical-
âradical association reactions and their reverse dissociation reactions
pose challenges due to the absence of a saddle point, and the use of the
VRC formulation of the transition state theory is necessary in certain
cases. However, for the same reason as in reaction R1, the VRC formu-
lation may not be required. Glarborg et al. [503] also derived the rate
constants of reaction R52 at 1.18 atm and using N2 as bath gas by
measuring the reverse rate constants in flow-reactor experiments on the
CO/O2/H2O/N2 system and using the enthalpy of formation of HNO (26
(cid:0) 1 at 298 K), obtaining bimolecular rate constants that are not
kcal mol
comparable to the unimolecular ones reported by Stagni et al. However,
a detailed and convenient comparison is that done by Jian et al. [504],
who compared the rate constants of the reverse reaction (H + NO + M â
HNO + M) derived from Stagni et al. and Glarborg et al., among other
authors, by estimating the third body efficiency of different species by
means of classical trajectories, and confirmed a very good agreement
between both, as can be seen in panel (b) of Fig. 34, supporting Stagni
et al. [201] calculations.

It is important to note the different third body efficiencies deter-
mined by Jian et al. for the bath gases Ar, He, N2, H2, and NH3 as well as
their temperature dependence, and thus the effect that this has in the
rate constants of R52. In fact, the comparison in panel (b) of Fig. 34
between the rate constants from Stagni et al. (with N2 as bath gas) and
those by Riley et al. [505] obtained in a high-temperature photochem-
istry reactor using Ar as bath gas were only in relatively good agreement,
with larger values for the former.

The hydrogen abstraction reaction R53 involves the consumption of
H atoms and thus contributes to the inhibition of flame propagation
[247]. Reaction R53 has been the target of three computational kinetic
studies, although none of them is sufficiently robust to guarantee ac-
curate rate constants. The corresponding rate constants are shown in
Fig. 35. Soto and Page used the improved VTST based on

4.3.6. Chemistry of nitroxyl radical

The HNO radical is a direct precursor of NO obtained via hydrogen
abstraction reactions or dissociation. In addition to its reactions with the
NH2 radical (R24 and R25) discussed in Section 4.3.3, the following
reactions in ammonia oxidation occurring under high- or intermediate-
temperature conditions are also important [217,449].

MRCI/cc-pVDZ//CISD/cc-pVDZ calculations but did not account for
torsional anharmonicity and tunneling effects (although tunneling is
expected to be unimportant as reaction R53 is almost barrierless) [506].
Sumathi et al. calculated the rate constants with the QRRK theory using
the CCSD(T)/6â311++G(3df,3pd)//CCSD(T)/6â311++G(d,p) level of
theory and did not implement torsional anharmonicity, tunneling, and
variational effects. They also found that the reaction kinetics was
dominated by the direct hydrogen abstraction channel [418]. Nguyen
et al. more recently used an even lower level of
i.e.
UQCISD/cc-pVTZ, to calculate the rate constants with the canonical and
microcanonical VTST but neglected torsional anharmonicity and
tunneling effects [507].

theory,

The use of the microcanonical ensemble by Nguyen et al. [507],
which is more complete than the canonical ensemble because it con-
siders the conservation of the total energy, has a relatively large effect at
intermediate and low temperatures. Although Sumathi et al. [418] and
Soto and Page [506] did not use that ensemble, they used a higher level
of theory for determining the electronic structure. It is therefore difficult
to identify the most accurate set of rate constants.

HNO can also undergo hydrogen abstraction reaction with the OH
radical, i.e., reaction R54. Soto and Page calculated the rate constants
with the transition state theory using multireference configuration
interaction (MRCI) single point energies from multiconfiguration self-
consistent field (MCSCF) complete-active space geometries with the
cc-pVDZ basis set [508]. Nguyen et al. [507] also calculated the rate
constants using the VTST and the microcanonical transition state theory
using the UQCISD/cc-pVDZ//UMP2/cc-pVDZ low level of theory. Their
rate constants are compared in Fig. 36, including those for the addition
channel that were also calculated by Soto and Page [506].

HNO + OHâHNOOH

(R57)

The different sets of calculated rate constants for reaction R54 are in
relatively good agreement, although at low temperatures, those by Soto
and Page deviate from Nguyen et al.âs results. This comparison suggests
that by improving the description of variational effects using the TST,
VTST, and Î¼VTST versions of the transition state theory, the rate con-
stants can be decreased. This also indicates that variational effects are
important. However, the calculations with the microcanonical version
are based on low-level electronic structure calculations and thus warrant
for further improvement. As for the addition channel, i.e., reaction R57,
Nguyen et al.âs work indicated that this channel is not competitive with
the hydrogen abstraction reaction.

The kinetics of reaction R55 is uncertain, as the rate constants were
determined in a computational study [509] with important flaws and an
experimental study [423] in which rate constants were reported only at
low temperatures (242â473 K). In their computational study, Du et al.
used the transition state theory and the B3LYP/6â31++G** low level of
theory to calculate rate constants without variational and torsional ef-
fects. They described a reaction mechanism that goes through a reaction
intermediate formed by the addition of reactants HNO and O, but did not
report any effects of pressure on the fate of that intermediate and thus on
the rate constants [510]. Pulsed laser photolysis-discharge flow--
photoionization mass spectrometry performed by Inomata and Washida
(cid:0) 1
[421] reported a rate constant value of 3.8â10
that was independent of temperature and pressure at 242â473 K and
0.02â0.1 atm. These values were in stark contrast with the values

Hydrogen abstraction reaction by O2 (reaction R56) also consumes
HNO, and it has garnered only slight attention. To the best of our
knowledge, only Wang et al. has addressed its kinetics. In their
computational work, the rate constants of reaction R56 were determined
with the conventional transition state theory using a PES characterized
at the CCSD(T)/CBS//B2PLYP-D3/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory [511].
Although they did not implement variational effects, they corrected
their rate constants with a hindered rotor treatment and tunneling

corrections. We conclude that the kinetics of the HNO radical is uncer-
tain as its corresponding reactions have not been extensively studied
and/or due to the flaws in computational works that addressed its ki-
netics. Therefore, new computational or experimental kinetic studies on
reactions R52, R53, R54, R55, R56, and R57 are required to improve
kinetic models, representing an interesting research line for future
works.

implement variational effects,

These discussions offer a roadmap on computational studies for
determining rate constants of reactions of importance in NH3 combus-
tion and pyrolysis. For instance, certain reactions such as R2, R5, R7,
R16, R17, R41, R47, R48, R49, R52, R53, R54, R55, and R56 have not
been addressed by sufficiently robust computational studies as they did
torsional, and multi-structural
not
anharmonicity effects simultaneously and/or were not based on high-
level electronic structure calculations. Although those effects are not
always very pronounced, some reactions are highly sensitive in kinetic
models. Thus, missing such effects may pose some uncertainties during
kinetic modeling. Furthermore, the kinetics of some of those reactions is
expected to be pressure-dependent, but the effects of pressure have not
been assessed, as is the case for reaction R41. In the case of reactions
between the NH2 radical and O atom, i.e., reactions R8, R14, and R15,
the overall rate constants agree well with each other; however, the
branching ratios are yet to be determined with certainty, which claims
for a robust computational study of these three reactions.

Finally, the rate constants of reactions R9 and R43 have not been
reported within a wide range of temperature and pressure ranges. Even
reactions R50 and R51, in which HNO is yielded and thus may control
the NOx yield, have simply not been addressed neither theoretically nor
experimentally at any temperature or pressure, motivating further ef-
forts. Table 4 lists the reactions and the selected kinetic parameters used
in the present model.

4.4. Kinetic model validations and analysis

Six comprehensive NH3 models from independent research groups
are chosen herein to further understand ammonia combustion chemis-
try. This comparison will highlight the influence of rate constant se-
lections on the performance of chemical kinetic models and enable
better understanding of ammonia combustion chemistry in idealized
systems. The models are named the Nakamura 2017 [241], Shrestha
2023 [343], Glarborg 2023 [262], Stagni 2023 [356], X. Zhang 2023
[362], and Zhu 2024 models [338]. To test the influence of the selected
rate constants from Section 4.3 of this review, we updated the X. Zhang
2023 model [362] with the corresponding kinetic parameters and
named the resulting model as the Present model. The combustion
chemistry of pure ammonia, DeNOx with ammonia, and ammonia/H2
mixture is reviewed with these models in hand.

4.4.1. Pure ammonia

The reaction path diagram for the pyrolysis and oxidation of
ammonia is briefly summarized in Fig. 37. This diagram is an updated
version based on that from Miller et al. [169,316]. Miller et al. investi-
gated ammonia oxidation under flame conditions, with a particular
focus on NO formation and destruction [169,513]. Their studies incor-
porated three major pathways: 1) (oxidative) pyrolysis reaction path-
ways via stepwise H-loss reactions NH3 â NH2 â NH â N (yellow box);
2) NO formation via the oxidation of NH2, NH, and N radicals mediated
with/without HNO; and 3) N2 formation via the reactions of NHi (i = 0-2)
+ NO mediated with/without NNH and N2O. More than 30 years has
passed by, yet the basic diagram for ammonia oxidation under flame
conditions remains nearly the same.

To improve the modeling of ammonia oxidation in flames, N2
pathways must be incorporated via the combination of NHi radicals
[332,417,444,514,515]. These reaction pathways are important under
pyrolysis and rich flame conditions [36,217,350,369]. Moreover, under
low- and intermediate-temperature conditions, HO2 radical is crucial for

entire temperature range, particularly under fuel-lean and stoichio-
metric conditions. This reaction has been studied intensively due to its
relevance in both combustion and atmospheric NOx production pro-
cesses [360]. Under high-temperature and fuel-lean conditions, O atom
becomes more abundant and the contribution of R6 enhances (NH3 + O
â NH2 + OH). Unlike R3 and R6, the H-atom abstraction reaction of
NH3 by HO2, i.e., R5 (NH3 + HO2 â NH2 + H2O2) remains understudied,
although it is an important chain-propagation reaction at low and in-
termediate temperatures. Previous modeling studies [170,321,330,347]
adopted earlier estimations from Miller and Bowman [513] for R5,
which is 1â2 orders of magnitude smaller than recent theoretical
calculation results [201]. Future experimental efforts are highly desired
to reduce this uncertainty.

Similar to NH3, the (oxidative) pyrolysis of amidogen proceeds via
unimolecular dissociation and H-atom abstraction reactions. Among
them, R7 (NH2 + H â NH + H2) has a large sensitivity under pyrolysis
and rich-flame conditions [217,262]. Experimental studies on the rate
parameter of R7 have mainly focused at high temperatures. Elishav et al.
[360] fitted the rate constant of R7 based on previous experimental and
theoretical studies [415,416,516] and recommended using their fitted
rate constant over 833â2800 K. Recent modeling work on ammonia
pyrolysis from Glarborg et al. [350] also evaluated the rate constant of
R7 by fitting data from the literature. Their evaluated rate constant for
R7 was within 20 % than the recommended value from Elishav et al.
[360] over 833â2500 K. However, the discrepancies increased below
800 K due to the lack of experimental data. New experimental mea-
surements coupled with a deep focus on NH thermochemistry are vital to
identify the low-temperature kinetics of R7. Under fuel-lean and stoi-
chiometric flame conditions, the most important reaction pathway to
convert NH2 to NH is R9 (NH2 + OH â NH + H2O). However, only a few
experimental data are available on the rate constant of this reaction. The
discrepancies among different theoretical calculation results are around
a factor of 4 over 1500â2500 K [315,332,396,417,427]. More experi-
mental efforts to reduce the uncertainties are required. At high tem-
peratures, imidogen (NH) can be converted to N atom via H-atom
abstraction reactions, i.e., R34 (NH + H â N + H2) and R38 (NH + OH
â N + H2O). As reviewed in Section 4.3, discrepancies among different
sources are still large. The selected values in this work require further
confirmation by experimental measurements.

Similar to methyl radical, NH2 radical is likely to proceed to N2
pathways via combination reactions with NHi, particularly under fuel-
rich conditions. Konnov and De Ruyck highlighted the importance of
NH3 + NH2 â N2H3 + H2 in their modeling study on ammonia pyrolysis
[517]. However, this estimation is currently not supported by any direct
measurements or by theoretical calculations; therefore, it is not incor-
porated in recent modeling studies [170,350,357]. The self-combination
of NH2 could lead to various branching channels, i.e., R18-R21. A recent
theoretical study computed the third-body efficiencies of R21 (NH2 +
NH2 (+ M) â N2H4 (+ M)), including argon, oxygen and ammonia
relative to nitrogen, which is valuable for developing the kinetic model
of ammonia [431]. In a previous theoretical calculation [332], R18
(NH2 + NH2 â HNNH + H2) and R19 (NH2 + NH2 â H2NN + H2) were
also deemed the possible channels in NH2 + NH2 potential energy sur-
face. Their rate constants were also computed for completeness. How-
ever, Elishav et al. believe that the lack of measurable contribution for
R18 and R19 in NH2 recombination justifies neglecting these channels
[360]. At high temperatures, only the disproportionation R12 (NH2 +
NH2 â NH3 + NH) is important. According to a previous review [360]
and modeling work [350], the computed rate constant of R12 from

For the combination of NH2 and NH, Elishav et al. reported R22
(NH2 + NH â HNNH + H) as the dominant channel [360]. As this re-
action produces H atom, it is crucial for ammonia pyrolysis and deter-
mining the ammonia flame propagation. Klippenstein et al. [332]
computed the rate constant for R22 based on a high level of theory,

determining the oxidation chemistry of ammonia. NH2 and HO2
combine to form H2NO, whereas NO and HO2 react to produce NO2.
Therefore, under low- and intermediate-temperature conditions, H2NO
and NO2-related reactions are vital for determining the ammonia
oxidation chemistry [187,189,196]. The following review on pure
ammonia combustion chemistry is organized according to three aspects:
the (oxidative) pyrolysis of ammonia (yellow box); the DeNOx reaction
kinetics (green box); and the NOx formation kinetics (red box). In each
aspect, critical reactions in governing ammonia combustion chemistry
are discussed. The predicted results of selected comprehensive chemical
kinetic models are compared against various sets of experimental data.

4.4.1.1. (Oxidative) pyrolysis kinetics. Ammonia as a fuel can be used in
engines and gas turbines, where the local fuel-rich areas exist. In these
areas, the pyrolysis chemistry of ammonia is crucial for determining the
combustion properties such as ignition delay and flame propagation. In
oxidative pyrolysis, oxygenated radicals such as O, OH, and HO2
participate in the pyrolysis route (see yellow box in Fig. 37). One of the
most important reactions in ammonia pyrolysis is the unimolecular
decomposition reaction. In a recent modeling study by Glarborg et al.,
sensitivity analyses for ammonia pyrolysis were conducted under
various conditions [262]. Their results show that R1 (NH3 â NH2 + H)
has the largest sensitivity coefficient. Moreover, R3 (NH3 + H â NH2 +
H2) is an important reaction under pyrolysis and fuel-rich flame condi-
tions, particularly for long residence times.

In the presence of oxygen, NH3 can be consumed by OH, O, and HO2
radicals via H-atom abstraction reactions to yield NH2, i.e., R4-R6.
Among them, R4 (NH3 + OH â NH2 + H2O) is vital as it is the main
chain-propagation reaction channel that produces amidogen over the

which was considerably higher than previous measurements [364,419,
444]. The previously reported review [360] and modeling work [350]
conclude that the value determined by Davidson et al. [364] offers the
best compromise on the available data. As R22 is an important reaction
under pyrolysis and rich-flame conditions, the kinetics of diazene be-
comes important [217,350]. Previous experimental and theoretical
studies on HNNH have been previously reported [417,510,514,515,
518â522]. Among them, Marshall et al. theoretically investigated the
chemistry of diazene isomers [514]. They obtained the rate parameters
for the isomerization between trans and cis configurations of HNNH, for
the thermal dissociation to NNH + H and for H-atom abstraction re-
actions of HNNH isomers. These new kinetic data were incorporated in
the recent pyrolysis model of NH3, which has implications for pre-
dictions at longer reaction times [262].

The aforementioned reactions are important in the simulations of
ammonia pyrolysis. Fig. 38 compares the NH3 decay between the
measured and predicted results in ST pyrolysis of ammonia in argon at
2096â2487 K and nearly atmospheric pressure. Under these conditions,
R1 (NH3 â NH2 + H) and R3 (NH3 + H â NH2 + H2) are the main
pathways for NH3 consumption. They are also responsible for chain-
initiation and chain-propagation, respectively, and therefore influence
NH3 decay [36]. Among different comprehensive models, the Glarborg
2023 model [262] and Zhu 2024 model [338] well predicted NH3
decomposition under all temperature conditions. In contrast, the results
predicted by the present model overlapped with X. Zhang 2023 model
adequately predicted the NH3 decay at 2236 and 2487 K and over-
predicting at 2096 K [362] because it relied on the higher rate constant
for NH3 + NH2 â N2H3 + H2. Indeed, X. Zhang 2023 model [362] and
the present model adopted higher rate constants than the Zhu 2024
model [338], which may result in higher predicted rates for NH3 decay.
Shrestha 2023 model [343] could also reasonably predict the experi-
mental targets; however, the other comprehensive models [241,356]
overpredict the rate of NH3 decay at all temperatures. Therefore, more
investigations are required to assess the uncertainties and significance of
reaction NH3 + NH2 â N2H3 + H2 under pyrolysis conditions [523].

Besides NH3, speciation data for NH2 and NH are also important
validation targets. They are not only sensitive to R1 and R3 but also
sensitive to R7 (NH2 + H â NH + H2), R12 (NH2 + NH2 â NH3 + NH),
R22 (NH2 + NH â HNNH + H), and R34 (NH + H â N + H2). Davidson
et al. measured the mole fractions of NH2 and NH in STs at atmospheric
pressure [364]. As shown in Fig. 39, all the models except Nakamura
2017 model can reasonably predict these speciation data [241].

To complement the validation of N2 pathways, N2H4 pyrolysis is also
selected as a validation target. Fig. 40 shows the mole fractions of N2H4
measured in N2H4 pyrolysis over 1100â1190 K and 2â3 atm. Recent
models such as Glarborg 2023 [262], Stagni 2023 [356], Shrestha 2023
[343], and Zhu 2024 model [338] could not predict the N2H4 decay. The
Present model and X. Zhang 2023 model [362] could well capture the
experimental data at 1100 and 1160 K while slightly underpredicting
the fuel decay at 1190 K. Based on the validation results shown in
Figs. 38â40, no model can capture all the validation targets accurately.
Further efforts will be needed to reduce the uncertainties in the
ammonia pyrolysis model.

4.4.2. NOx formation kinetics

In ammonia combustion, NOx formation reaction pathways occur
mainly via the oxidation reactions of NH2, NH, and N. These radicals
may react with O2, O, OH, and HO2 to produce NO or oxygenated in-
termediates such as H2NO and HNO, which can eventually be converted
to NO. The combination of NH2 and O can form HNO and NH via R15
(NH2 + O â HNO + H) and R8 (NH2 + O â NH + OH), respectively.
Despite the importance of these reactions for NO formation at high
temperatures, their related kinetic data are considerably limited. Earlier
measurements [525] for the overall rate parameter of NH2+O at room
temperature are around one order of magnitude lower than more recent
recent
measurements

[419â421].

discrepancies

among

The

measurements are within a factor of
two at room temperature
[419â421]. The temperature dependency of NH2 + O remains uncertain
as few experimental studies focused on temperatures above 298 K. For
the branching ratio between R8 and R15, previous experimental and
theoretical studies support a value ranging from 8 % to 15 % [418â421].
The discrepancies remain large for the branching ratio, and studies have
suggested that R15 is the dominant branching channel. Future studies
are required to measure the rate parameters of R8 and R15 under
combustion-related conditions.

At high pressures and intermediate temperatures, HO2 becomes the
primary chain carrier and the reaction between NH2 and HO2 becomes a
key step. Unfortunately, uncertainty in the kinetics of NH2+HO2 re-
mains, although research has improved considerably over the years.
Based on Elishav et al.âs review [360], R17 (NH2 + HO2 â H2NO + OH)
and R10 (NH2 + HO2 â NH3 + O2) are the main product channels for
NH2 + HO2. This finding is consistent with the recent theoretical
calculation of Klippenstein and Glarborg [434]. As R17 and R10 are
chain-propagation and chain-termination reactions, respectively, their
relative importance is critical for predicting ammonia oxidation. In
earlier studies, whether NH2 + HO2 proceeds via both R17 and R10 or
only R17 remained unclear [429,435,526,527]. Glarborg et al. [200]
adopted both reactions in their modeling work and estimated a
temperature-independent branching ratio of 28 % for R10 in R17 and
R10. A theoretical study by Sumathi and Peyerimhoff concluded that
R17 is the predominant channel over 300â2000 K and 0.001â10 atm
[430], which was later adopted by Song et al. in their modeling [196].
In contrast, recent theoretical calculation and experimental studies
[201,361,431,434] support that the rate constant of R10 was largely
underestimated by earlier studies [200,322,430]. The recent theoretical
calculation results [201,434] on the rate constant of R10 reasonably
agree with the measured results reported by Glarborg et al. [431].
Experimental measurements for R17 are very limited. A recent experi-
mental study on NH2 + HO2 [431] estimated that the rate constant of
(cid:0) 1 at 298 K, which is two-fold that
R17 is 2.5â10
computed by Klippenstein and Glarborg [434] and twice lower than that
estimated by Song et al. [196]. Due to the large uncertainties in the rate
constant of R17, the branching ratio of R17 and R10 is still uncertain.
However, a recent theoretical calculation determined the branching
ratio [434] of R10 in R17 and R10 as ~80 % and almost independent of
temperature. More experimental measurements are highly desired to
constrain R17 for better characterization of the branching ratios of R17
and R10.

Similar to NH2, NH can be consumed by oxygenated species. R40
(NH + O2 â HNO + O) and R41 (NH + O2 â NO + OH) are two
competitive reactions in ammonia combustion. Dean and Bozzelli per-
formed the QRRK calculations and found that at 1 atm, R40 is the
dominant channel above 1000 K, whereas R41 is dominant between 430
and 1000 K [322]. More recent [485] calculations using a high level of
theory confirmed these findings [322]. According to Elishav et al. [360],
several experimental data available for the rate constant of R41 [440,
484,486,499] still have large uncertainty. They recommended to adopt
the measurements from R Ìomming and Wagner [484] for use, as their
measurements present the best compromise among the experimental
data although it is around 10 times higher than that computed by
Talipov et al. [485] at 2000 K. Measurements on the rate constant of R40
are very limited, particularly at lower temperatures [479,484]. Elishav
et al. [360] fitted previous data [479,483,484] to obtain the recom-
mended value, which was also ~10 times higher than that calculated by
Talipov et al. [485] at 2000 K. Both experimental and theoretical
calculation studies on NH + O2 are desired to better understand its re-
action kinetics.

In addition to R38 (NH + OH â N + H2O), the combination of NH
and O can form HNO and H, i.e., R37 (NH + OH â HNO + H). Elishav
et al. [360] reviewed previous studies on R37 and found a considerable
disagreement and uncertainties among various coefficients [208,332,
418,480,526] such as temperature-dependency and absolute values. In

Section 4.3, we used the rate constant from Klippenstein et al. [332]
because they used a higher level of theory and their results had good
agreement with one set of measurements [480]. According to Klippen-
stein et al. [332], R37 and R38 are the main channels for NH + OH, and
R37 is dominant at low- and intermediate-temperatures; however, its
dominance is reduced as the temperatures increase. At 2000 K, the
branching ratio of R37 in R37 and R38 is 66 %.

The combination between NH and O can either proceed via an
additionâelimination reaction (R36) to produce NO + H or H-atom
abstraction reaction (R35) to yield N + OH. R36 was considered more
favorable due to its lower activation energy [528]. Some subsequent
evaluation and theoretical calculation studies supported these conclu-
sions [75,208,340,474,476,477], concluding that R36 dominates the

46

conversion of NH + O at 500â2000 K and H-atom abstraction reaction
can be neglected. Due to the lack of experimental constraints at room
and high temperatures,
the rate constant of R36 still has large
uncertainties.

Nitroxide (H2NO) is an important intermediate in the low- and
intermediate-temperature oxidation of ammonia [196,451], which
eventually forms NOx. It can be produced via R30 (NH2 + NO2 â H2NO
+ NO) and R17 (NH2 + HO2 â H2NO + OH) and consumed via unim-
olecular decomposition and H-atom abstraction reactions. H-atom

important and their rate constants are estimated in the review [322] and
modeling studies [200,260]. More recent studies identified the impor-
tance of R47 (H2NO + O2 â HNO + HO2) in the low- and
intermediate-temperature oxidation of ammonia, particularly under
fuel-lean conditions [170,196,361,449]. In addition to R47, recent
theoretical calculation study [449] also computed the rate constants of
H2NO + radicals, i.e., R48 (H2NO + HO2 â HNO + H2O2) and R49
(H2NO + NO2 â HNO + HONO) using a high level of theory. Large
discrepancies were observed between their computed rate constants
[449] and previous estimations [260,322]. At 800â1200 K, where these
reactions are highly sensitive, the discrepancies between them can reach
a factor of 4â10. These radicalâradical reactions should therefore be
further studied, although they pose great challenges to both experi-
mental and theoretical calculations.

HNO is another important intermediate in ammonia oxidation,
which can produce NO via unimolecular decomposition reaction and H-
atom abstraction reactions, i.e., R52âR56. Among them, R52âR55 are
more favorable under flame conditions because the require high tem-
peratures and abundant radicals [217], whereas R56 is favorable under
intermediate-temperature conditions [196]. As discussed in Section 4.3,
previous studies have not sufficiently reported on HNO kinetics,
although such kinetics are vital in ammonia combustion chemistry.

Future efforts are desired to reduce the uncertainties in the following
reaction rate constants:

Figs. 41 and 42 show the speciation data of NH3 oxidation in a JSR
and flow reactor, respectively, under fuel-lean conditions. Therefore,
NH3 is mainly consumed via the H-atom abstraction reaction by OH, i.e.,
R4 (NH3 + OH â NH2 + H2O). Due to the large difference in pressure
between JSR at 1 atm and flow reactor at 100 atm, the subsequent re-
action pathways of NH2 and the formation of NO and N2O are different.
Under atmospheric JSR conditions, NH2 is mainly consumed by NO via
R27 (NH2 + NO â NNH + OH) and R28 (NH2 + NO â N2 + H2O). Under
high-pressure flow reactor conditions, HO2 radical becomes more
abundant and can convert NO to NO2. Therefore, the contribution of R27
and R28 to the conversion of NH2 is reduced at high pressures. Instead,
R29 (NH2 + NO2 â N2O + H2O) and R30 (NH2 + NO2 â H2NO + NO)
favorably consume NH2. As H2NO is the product of R30, its subsequent
reaction pathways are an important source of NO under high-pressure
conditions. In addition, NO and N2O can be directly produced via R30
and R29 at high pressures, respectively.

At atmospheric pressure, H2NO is mainly produced via R17 (NH2 +
HO2 â H2NO + OH) instead of R30, as NO2 is not an important product.
Similarly, subsequent reactions involving H2NO can form NO. In addi-
tion, as the reaction temperature window at atmospheric pressure is

reactivity of NH3 oxidation. Therefore, R17 is highly sensitive to ignition
delay times, particularly those obtained in an RCM. The recommended
rate constant of R17 in Section 4.3 is only half as large as that reported
by the X. Zhang 2023 model [362], leading to a lower reactivity of NH3
oxidation predicted by the Present model.

Under flame conditions, the contribution of H2NO- and NO2-related
reactions is negligible, whereas those related to NH and N2 species are
favorable. HNO can be directly produced by the oxidation of NH2 and
NH, whereas NO can be produced by the oxidation of NH and N, which is
not favorable at low- and intermediate-temperatures. Under fuel-rich
conditions, the reactions related to N2H2 become important, i.e., R22
(NH2 + NH â HNNH + H), which are similar to the controlling chem-
istry under pyrolysis conditions. Alturaifi et al. [36] concluded that a
reliable NH3 pyrolysis mechanism can improve the predictions of
laminar flame speeds. As shown in Fig. 44, most of the selected models
can adequately predict the laminar flame speeds of NH3/air, except for
the Glarborg 2023 model [262]. Note that the radiation effects of H2O,
NH3, NO, and N2O were considered in the simulations, which yielded
lower predicted laminar flame speeds. The simulation method and
Planck-mean absorption coefficients were adopted from Nakamura and
Shindo [241].

4.4.3. Ammonia/NOx mixtures

â¦

In 1970s, Lyon [300] discovered a new rapid homogeneous
gas-phase reaction: NH3âNOâO2. Ammonia could rapidly and nearly
quantitatively reduce NO to N2 and H2O in the presence of O2 at
900â1100
C. This new chemical reaction was developed into the
thermal DeNOx process. Earlier studies on ammonia were motivated by
the DeNOx kinetics [169,200,260,313,314,321], which reported R27
(NH2 + NO â NNH + OH) and R28 (NH2 + NO â N2 + H2O) as the
controlling reactions in NO removal. These reactions are also highly
sensitive under wide operating conditions in pure ammonia combustion,
as they are the main chain-branching and chain-termination reactions,
respectively [217,282,321]. The overall rate constant and branching
ratio of R27 and R28 have been extensively reviewed [170,315,360].
Based on the review of Klippenstein et al., the uncertainties in the
overall rate constants of R27 and R28 are generally within a factor of
two [315]. Compared with overall rate constant, the branching ratios for
R27 and R28 are more sensitive in model predictions [170,271,314].
Recent theoretical calculation and experimental values agree well with
each other, particularly in the temperature window of DeNOx, which
considerably reduce the uncertainties in thermal DeNOx [314,315,452,
529,530].

higher than that at high pressures, NH2 can further convert to NH. NH
oxidation can also form NO via R41 (NH + O2 â NO + OH), although it
only plays a minor role. N2O can be formed at atmospheric pressures via
R44 (NO + NH â N2O + H) besides R29. Compared with the measured
results in JSR oxidation [252] (Fig. 41), all the selected models except
the Zhu 2024 model [338] overpredicted the reaction rate of NH3 and
the formation rate of H2O. The Zhu 2024 model [338] well captured the
initial NH3 conversion and underpredicted the oxidation rate of NH3
above 1350 K. The Present model, Zhang 2023 [362], and Stagni 2023
model [356] reasonably captured the formation of NO, and the Zhang
2023 model [362] could predict the yield of N2O. The Zhu 2024 model
[338] underpredicted the yields of NO and N2O, whereas the other
selected models overpredicted these values. Note that the Present model
and X. Zhang 2023 model [362] showed large discrepancies in pre-
dicting N2O formation. Under the atmospheric condition, N2O is mainly
produced via R44 (NO + NH â N2O + H); this reaction is also highly
sensitive to N2O formation. Its recommended rate constant in Section
4.3 is ~40%â60 % higher than that adopted in the Zhang 2023 model
[362] at 1100â1500 K. This, a higher N2O prediction is yielded by the
Present model. The Present model, Zhang 2023 model [362], and
Nakamura 2017 [241] model can reasonably predict the temperature
window of NH3 at high pressures (Fig. 42). However, only the Zhu 2024
model [338] can reasonably predict the yield of N2O.

Fig. 43aâf show the ignition delay times of NH3/air mixtures in a ST
at 1100â1600 K and various equivalence ratios. Under these conditions,
R27 (NH2 + NO â NNH + OH) and R28 (NH2 + NO â N2 + H2O) serve
as crucial chain-branching and chain-termination reactions in ammonia
ignition. Among all the selected models, the X. Zhang 2023 model [362]
and Zhu 2024 model [338] reasonably predicted the ignition delay times
under all the conditions. Fig. 43gâi show the ignition delay times of
NH3/O2/Ar mixtures measured in an RCM at 1060â1130 K and 40 bar
[189]. Under these conditions, besides R27 and R28, H2NO-related re-
actions present large sensitivity [189]. The X. Zhang 2023 model [362],
Stagni 2023 model [356], and Zhu 2024 model [338] reasonably pre-
dicted the experimental data, whereas the other models overpredicted
the ignition delay times. Note that the Present model predicted longer
ignition delay times than the X. Zhang 2023 model [362], particularly
under RCM conditions. HO2-related reactions are favorable at high
pressures and intermediate temperatures. The fuel radical NH2 converts
HO2 to OH via R17 (NH2 + HO2 â H2NO + OH), enhancing the

Similar to NH2 + NO, the combination of NH2 and NO2 majorly
proceeds via R29 (NH2 + NO2 â N2O + H2O) and R30 NH2 + NO2 â
H2NO + NO. These two reactions are favorable under fuel-lean and
lower temperature conditions, where NO is readily converted to NO2 via
HO2 radical. R29 and R30 presents opposite sensitivities in model pre-
dictions, as is a chain-propagation reaction and the former is a chain-
termination reaction [187,196]. Glarborg et al. reviewed the overall
rate constant of R29 and R30 and concluded that the scatter among
literature data is still considerable [260]. They recommended adopting
their earlier evaluation [260] on the overall rate constant as it better
reconciled the available data [456,531â533]. For the branching ratio of
R29 and R30, they found most studies supported a value of ~20 % for
R29 and R30, which was adopted in their model [260]. A more recent
theoretical calculation study [534] computed the branching ratio as 22
%, close to that evaluated by Glarborg et al. [260].

NNH is a critical intermediate in DeNOx chemistry. It can either be
consumed by O2, NO, and reactive radicals via bimolecular reactions or
decomposed to N2 and H atom via unimolecular dissociation reaction.
Among them, unimolecular dissociation reactions produce N2 and H
atom, which can react with O2 to proceed via chain-branching reaction
and accelerate the reaction process. In a modeling study by Klippenstein
et al. [315], they reviewed the lifetime of NNH based on literature data
[351,370,535â544] and found that the discrepancies in the reported
lifetime reached three orders of magnitudes. They evaluated the quali-
(cid:0) 9 s for the life-
ties of previous studies and believed that a value of 10
time of NNH was more reasonable for developing the model, which is 10
times shorter than those reported by Miller and Glarborg et al. [314].
Thus, the unimolecular dissociation reaction of NNH becomes a domi-
nant channel in NNH decay in the DeNOx process, whereas the contri-
butions of bimolecular reactions of NNH become less competitive. The
unimolecular dissociation reaction of NNH is favorable for the DeNOx
process and sensitive in modeling flame propagation [217]. However,
the uncertainties of the lifetime of NNH are still very large. Fig. 45

compares the NNH lifetimes derived from the literature. The discrep-
ancies among different studies are more than three orders of magnitude.
Recent theoretical calculations [417,545] support a much shorter life-
time of NNH than that evaluated by Klippenstein et al. [315]. The energy
barrier of NNH decomposition, tunneling calculation method, and the
effect of torsional anharmonicity are crucial for determining the lifetime
of NNH accurately. Further efforts on reducing the uncertainties of NNH
lifetime are highly desired.

Thermal DeNOx is effective only in a narrow temperature window as
it is initiated by the NH2 radical. At lower temperatures, NH2 cannot be
produced via the chain-initiation reaction (R2, NH3 + O2 â NH2 +
HO2); therefore, R27 (NH2 + NO â NNH + OH) and R28 (NH2 + NO â
N2 + H2O) cannot occur. At lower temperatures, however, R28 domi-
nates the fate of NH2, leading to chain termination. As the temperature
increases, the branching ratio of R27 increases. In the temperature
window of thermal DeNOx (~1100â1400 K), the branching ratio of R27
in R27 and R28 is ~32%â44 % [314,315,452,529], which is sufficient to
support the chain-initiation reaction. Thus, the DeNOx process occurs
efficiently in this temperature range. Although the branching ratio of
R27 in R27 and R28 increases at higher temperatures, NH2 favorably
reacts with oxygenated radicals such as O or loses H via R7 (NH2 + H â
NH + H2) and R9 (NH2 + OH â NH + H2O) to produce NH. Both these
reactions likely yield NO at high temperatures. The increasing contri-
bution of NOx formation pathways at high temperatures becomes
competitive with DeNOx pathways, thereby reducing the efficiency of
thermal DeNOx process.

Figs. 46 and 47 show the mole fractions of NO and N2O in the flow
reactor oxidation of NH3/NO mixtures with various O2 contents. Pre-
vious comprehensive models could reasonably capture the DeNOx
temperature window of 1100â1400 K. As for the prediction of the mole
fraction of N2O, the X. Zhang 2023 [362] model captured its yield with
O2 contents varying from 1% to 10 % while failing to capture the tem-
perature window of N2O with 50 % O2 content. Other literature models,

particularly the Present model, Shrestha 2023, and Stagni 2023 models
[356], overpredicted N2O yields with O2 contents varying from 1 % to
10 %. Under the DeNOx conditions, NO was mainly consumed by R27
and R28. Only a small amount of NO was consumed by HO2 to produce
NO2. N2O can be produced by combining NH2 and NO2 via R29. At
higher temperatures, NH2 is consumed by the H-atom abstraction re-
actions to produce NH, which can combine with NO to produce N2O and
H (i.e., R44, NH + NO â N2O + H). Note that the Present model pre-
dicted a higher yields of N2O than the X. Zhang 2023 model [362] with
O2 contents varying from 1 % to 10 % and a lower N2O yield at 50 % O2
content. Under low O2 content conditions, N2O is mainly produced via
R44. The rate constant of R44 (Section 4.3) is ~50 % higher than that in
X. Zhang 2023 model [362], resulting in a higher prediction of N2O yield

by the Present model. In contrast, under high O2 conditions, NO can be
oxidized to NO2, which then converts NH2 to N2O via R29 (NH2 + NO2
â N2O + H2O). R29 is highly sensitive to N2O formation under high O2
content conditions. The rate constant of R29 recommended in Section
4.3 is only half as large as that in the X. Zhang 2023 model [362],
leading to a lower N2O prediction by the Present model at 50 % O2
content.

Fig. 48 compares the measured and predicted speciation data for the
NH3/NO2/NO/N2 mixture. NH3 and NO2 are the major reactants,
whereas NO and N2O are the main products. NO2 can be consumed by
NH2 via R30 and R29 to produce NO and N2O, respectively. Therefore,
the yields of NO and N2O are useful to constrain the rate constants of the
two reactions. The temperature windows of both reactants and products

allow for examining the overall rate constant of NH2 + NO2. As shown in
Fig. 48, previous models, except the Stagni 2023 model, could reason-
ably capture the conversion of NH3 and NO2 to NO and N2O [356]. This
model overpredicted the conversion rates of NH3 and NO2 and the N2O
yield, consistent with the predictions shown in.

Fig. 47 Cornell et al. [356] recently reported the speciation data
measured during the JSR oxidation of NH3/NO2 mixture at atmospheric
pressure (Fig. 49) [546]. None of the kinetic models, except the Present
model and Nakamura 2017 model, could reproduce the conversion of
NH3 [241]. The oxidation rate of NH3 was overestimated by these
models, as shown in Fig. 49a. All the selected models, except the Stagni
2023 model, could reasonably predict the oxidation rate of NO2
(Fig. 49b) [356]. For NO formation, none of the selected models could
correctly predict the experimental data (Fig. 49c). According to Cornell
et al., R30 and R29 as well as H2NO kinetics are sensitive during the
prediction of experimental data [546]. However, H2NO kinetics are not
well-understood (Section 4.3). More experimental and theoretical
calculation studies focusing on H2NO kinetics are therefore highly
desired, which will improve the predictions shown in Fig. 48.

4.4.4. Ammonia/hydrogen mixtures

As a fuel candidate, NH3 exhibits a low laminar flame speed, a high
auto-ignition temperature, and a narrow flammability range, which
mainly limit its practical applications [14]. Cofiring NH3/H2 mixtures
produces zero carbon emissions while enhancing the intensity of NH3

combustion and diminishing the safety concerns regarding H2. Funda-
mental combustion chemistry studies can facilitate better understanding
of the effects of NH3/H2 blending and the inherent mechanism of engine
performance. In this section, the effects of H2 on ammonia conversion
and NOx formation are presented, and the controlling reactions in
NH3/H2 oxidation are discussed.

Fig. 50 sows the distributions of NH3, H2O, NO, and N2O in the JSR
oxidation of various NH3/H2 mixtures. As the H2 content increases from
0 % to 70 %, the temperature windows of NH3 conversion and product
yield decrease, indicating that the addition of H2 can enhance the
reactivity of NH3 oxidation. Fig. 51 shows the influence of H2 on the NH3
ignition and flame propagation. Increasing H2 content reduces the
ignition delay times of ammonia and increases the laminar flame speeds.
This also proves that the addition of H2 can enhance the reactivity of
ammonia oxidation. Compared with the experimental measurements
[272,280,282], all the comprehensive models [170,201,241,282,331,
339] can capture the enhancement effects of H2 on ammonia oxidation
(Figs. 50 and 51).

Compared with that of the fuel structures between H2 and NH3, the
bond dissociation energy (BDE) of NâH bond in NH3 molecule is ~3 kcal
(cid:0) 1 higher than that of HâH bond in H2 [547,548]. Therefore, the
mol
temperature threshold for H2 oxidation is expected to be lower than that
for NH3 oxidation. When blending H2
the
chain-initiation reactions first occur in H2 oxidation at lower tempera-
tures and the radicals produced in H2 oxidation can then trigger NH3

in NH3 oxidation,

oxidation. The controlling reaction pathways and critical reactions in
NH3/H2 oxidation are shown in Fig. 52 and compared with pure NH3
oxidation.

In pure NH3 oxidation (Fig. 52a, blue lines), R27 (NH2 + NO â NNH
+ OH) and R28 (NH2 + NO â N2 + H2O) are the main reaction pathways
for NH2 consumption. They also have the largest negative and positive
sensitivity coefficients for NH3 consumption (Fig. 52b), as they are the
dominant chain-branching and chain-termination reactions, respec-
tively. Through these pathways, an OH radical can be produced, which
can subsequently consume NH3. As the H2 content increases, R3 (NH3 +
H = NH2 + H2) proceeds in its reverse directionâthe NH2 radical
combines with H2 to produce the NH3 and H atom. This reaction is only
sensitive in NH3/H2 mixtures and not in pure NH3 oxidation at Õ= 0.25
(Fig. 52b). R3 has two effects: 1) it converts the blended H2 to NH3,
compensating for the decreasing NH3 content, and 2) converts the NH2
radical to H atom, which can then combine with O2 to form a new chain-
branching pathway via H + O2 = O + OH. This reaction is the primary
chain-branching reaction in H2 oxidation, which presents the largest
negative sensitivity for NH3 consumption in the JSR oxidation of NH3/
H2 at atmospheric pressure (Fig. 52b). It is also a crucial chain-
branching reaction in NH3/H2 mixtures under flame conditions. The
as-produced O atom can abstract H atom from H2 and NH3 to produce
another OH. As a competitive reaction to H + O2 = O + OH, the com-
bination of H and O2 produces HO2 radical. At intermediate and high
temperatures, HO2 is a chain carrier that can convert an H atom to two
OH radicals. At high-pressure conditions, the self-combination reaction
of HO2 produces H2O2, which can decompose into two OH radicals via
H2O2(+M) = OH + OH(+M). This is also an important pathway in
hydrogen oxidation. Chain branching via the decomposition of H2O2 is
favorable for NH3/H2 oxidation under intermediate- and high-pressure
conditions, i.e., in RCMs [189]. As the OH radical is an important
abstractor over the entire temperature range, accelerating the formation
of OH radicals can enhance the chain-propagation reaction of R4 (NH3
+ OH â NH2 + H2O) and promote the consumption of NH3.

In summary, H2 blending enhances the reverse reaction of R3. The H
atom produced via the reverse reaction of R3 triggers the vital chain-
branching and chain-propagation reactions in H2 oxidation (i.e., H +
O2 = O + OH/HO2). This changes the dominant chain-branching reac-
tion from NH3-related reaction R27 to H2-related reactions H + O2 = O
+ OH and/or H2O2(+M) = OH + OH(+M). Consequently, more
hydrogen related radicals, such as H, O, OH, and HO2 radicals, are
produced to enhance NH3 consumption (Fig. 52a, red lines).

Under flame conditions, the thermal and transport effects of H2
blending are also important. The adiabatic temperature of H2 is
considerably higher than that of NH3. As the H2 content increases, the
adiabatic temperatures of NH3/H2 mixture increase. H atom and H2
have the lowest molecular weights; therefore, they rapidly diffuse
compared with other species. Thus, the thermal and transport effects of

H2 can also enhance the ammonia combustion in NH3/H2 flames.

Herein,

the performance of various comprehensive models is
compared with experimental targets. Although recent models such as
the Zhu 2024 [338], X. Zhang 2023 [362], Stagni 2023 [356], Shrestha
2023 [343], and Glarborg 2023 [262] models adopted very recent
progresses in model parameters, they could not well predict all the
experimental targets. The present model was constructed by carefully
evaluating the previously reported rate constants. However, this model
could not sufficiently guarantee accuracy against all the targets. To
better reconcile experiments and kinetic models in the future, rigid
model optimization is the optimal way.

Previous studies on NOx formation were conducted when blending
H2 in ammonia oxidation [189,282]. Fig. 53 shows the distributions of
NO and N2O with increasing H2 content in NH3/H2 mixtures under the
JSR oxidation and flame conditions, representing intermediate- and
high-temperature conditions, respectively. The NOx yields exhibit a
non-monotonic trend based on the measured and predicted results
(Fig. 53). The dilution effects of H2 can reduce NOx formation as the
thermal NOx pathways in pure H2 oxidation are not comparable with
fuelâNOx pathways in pure NH3 oxidation, particularly under JSR
oxidation conditions, where the temperatures are not sufficiently high.
However, the NO yields increase with an initial increase in H2 content,
mainly due to the chemical effects of H2 that can promote NO formation.
NH2, NH, and N radicals can either combine with O2, O, OH, and HO2 to
proceed via NOx formation-related pathways or react with NO and NO2
to proceed via DeNOx-related pathways (Fig. 37). Thus, NOx formation
and DeNOx-related reactions compete with each other. The increasing
H2 content boosts the production of oxygenated radicals (i.e., O, OH, and
HO2). As can be seen from Fig. 53b, the amount of H, O, HO2, and OH
radicals increase with increasing H2 content. These radicals can make
NOx formation pathways more competitive than the DeNOx pathways,
thereby enhancing NO formation. Therefore, H2 blending has enhancing
chemical effects on NO formation when blended at low concentrations.
At higher concentrations, NO reduction is mainly caused by the
dilution effects of H2, which has a much lower NO formation tendency
than NH3. N2O is mainly formed via R29 (NH2 + NO2 â N2O + H2O) and
R44 (NO + NH â N2O + H). Therefore, its yield is related to both NHi
and NO/NO2. On one hand, increasing the H2 content makes the DeNOx-
related pathways less favorable and suppresses them. On the other hand,
the enhanced production of NO and NO2 due to increased H2 content
promotes these two reactions. Therefore, H2 blending has both sup-
pressing and enhancing chemical effects on N2O formation. In summary,
both dilution and chemical effects of H2 addition contribute to NOx
formation. As the H2 content increases, the related dilution effects
reduce NOx formation. H2 has promoting chemical effects on NO for-
mation and both promoting and inhibiting chemical effects on N2O
formation.

5. Challenges and opportunities

Ammonia utilization as an energy vector is important for decar-
bonizing the economy, either for transporting and delivering clean
hydrogen or as a direct-to-power fuel. Herein, we comprehensively
reviewed chemistry-related studies on ammonia pyrolysis and oxida-
tion. To conclude this in-depth overview, we highlight some challenges
and opportunities for academic researchers and engineers to advance
the utilization of ammonia in real-world applications.

In noncatalytic thermal pyrolysis, the high temperatures necessary
for ammonia are better suited for applications in waste heat integration
and for generating valuable products such as pure hydrogen. High-
temperature pyrolysis chemistry is well understood, therefore the
focus of research should be on various reactor configurations such as
FBMRs, multistage setups with inter-stage heating, and PMRs to maxi-
mize hydrogen yield and reactor efficiency. More rigorous chemical
kinetics and fluid mechanics models are required to predict ammonia
decomposition behavior in plasma and microwave reactors.

In the case of catalytic ammonia decomposition, there are major
challenges in finding efficient catalysts and reactor configurations for
accommodating industrial-scale production. The major challenges
include catalyst efficiency, scalability, and cost-effectiveness while
enhancing catalyst lifetime and reducing post-compression energy re-
quirements. Monometallic, multimetallic, alloy, nitride, carbide, and
metal amide/imide catalysts were studied, which are often supported
and promoted for enhanced catalytic activity. The choice of support and
promoters considerably affects the performance of these catalysts. While
Ru-based catalysts have shown high efficiency, their limited availability
and high cost are major drawbacks. Alternatives based on non-noble
metals such as cobalt, nickel, and iron are needed. The lack of stan-
dardized testing procedures, material preparation methods, and reac-
tivity assessment protocols makes it difficult to reliably compare and
identify the best catalyst from the existing literature.

The implementation of catalyst materials in novel reactor technolo-
gies such as microchannel reactors, packed-bed membrane reactors, and
H2-selective membrane reactors is promising for improving heat and
mass transfer, enhancing conversion efficiency, and simplifying the
purification processes. More energy-efficient and sustainable processes
can be established by exploring alternative energy sources for providing
heat to endothermic reactions such as microwave, plasma, solar energy,
and electrolysis. Combining catalytic processes with other technologies
such as closed-cycle hydrogen turbine power plants offers potential for
enhanced efficiency and wider application of hydrogen production from
ammonia.

A more efficient and cost-effective approach for using ammonia is
direct combustion for power. This review provided a comprehensive
analysis of ammonia combustion properties measured in both zero-
dimensional transient systems and one-dimensional steady systems.
Chemical kinetic models have been validated against measured global
combustion properties and species concentrations such as NH3, O2, H2O,
NO, NO2, N2O, and N2. This review identified the need to improve the
accuracy of laminar flame speed measurements for ammonia, particu-
larly under high-temperature and high-pressure conditions. Radiation-
induced errors in laminar flame speed measurements have been a
concern, and surface effects on combustion properties require further
investigation. Future work should focus on experiments at practical
high-temperature and high-pressure conditions and at measuring
ammonia combustion intermediates, including unstable radicals.

Modeling the complex combustion chemistry of ammonia necessi-
tates a comprehensive and accurate representation of reaction pathways
for oxidation and pyrolysis reactions, NOx formation, and DeNOx re-
actions. Although significant progress has been made in understanding
ammonia chemistry, some challenges and uncertainties remain. Re-
actions involving NH3, NH2, and NH radicals have been extensively
studied; however, some reactions lack experimental data, which con-
tributes to model uncertainty. NH2 and HO2 radicals are important

under flame conditions, which affect ammonia oxidation. NOx is formed
primarily via the oxidation of NH2 and NH radicals, which produce NO.
Key reactions involve radicals reacting with oxygenated species. The
rate constants of these reactions are still uncertain due to limited data,
particularly under combustion conditions. This work compared model
predictions against experimental results for NH3 decay, NH2 and NH
speciation, and N2H4 pyrolysis, highlighting the need for further
experimental efforts to improve the model accuracy. Similar challenges
exist for H2NO and HNO intermediates, where experimental and theo-
retical studies are required. Improving the accuracy of kinetic models for
ammonia pyrolysis and oxidation requires addressing uncertainties in
reaction rate constants via experimental measurements and theoretical
calculations. A constrained optimization of kinetic model parameters is
required using rigorous uncertainty quantification-based methods such
as Monte Carlo or Bayesian statistics in both theoretical calculations and
experiments. For H2 blending, models generally capture NH3 oxidation
enhancement and NOx trends well; however, discrepancies in N2O pre-
dictions and the understanding of critical reactions persist. This review
underscores the need for refining mechanisms related to H2 and NH3
interactions to enhance model accuracy.

6. Closing

Natural chemistry led to the formation of ammonia on Earth and its
role as a building block of life. Billions of years after its emergence in
nature, and merely a century ago, our recent ancestors mastered the
chemistry of ammonia production at industrial scales. The result has
been rapid population growth and increasing impact of human activities
on the planet. We stand at the forefront of a new era in which ammonia
can potentially transform the energy economy. The success of our en-
ergy transition, and the fate of our descendants, will depend on our
mastery of ammonia pyrolysis and oxidation chemistry.
