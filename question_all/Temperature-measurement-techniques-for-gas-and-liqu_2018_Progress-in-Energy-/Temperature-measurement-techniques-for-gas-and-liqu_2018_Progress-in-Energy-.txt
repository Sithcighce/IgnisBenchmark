Optical diagnostics for fluid temperature measurements continue to further our understanding of flows
involving heat transfer and/or chemical reactions, which are intrinsic to key areas including energy produc-
tion, the process industries, transportation, heating/cooling systems and naturally-occurring thermal con-
vection. Besides temperature, all flows must also be described by their velocity. As these flows are often
turbulent, an important capability is to measure both velocity and temperature at the same time to capture,
for example, the turbulent heat flux term appearing in the energy conservation equation.

This paper reviews temperature measurement techniques for fluid flows that are based on thermographic
phosphors, which are materials that possess temperature-dependent luminescence properties. Phosphor
particles are seeded into the fluid flow of interest. Following laser excitation, the luminescence of the par-
ticles is detected, and the temperature measurement is derived using either the spectral intensity ratio or
the lifetime. The same particles can also be used for velocity measurements using well-established particle-
based approaches, such as laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) or particle image velocimetry (PIV), producing
instantaneously correlated vector-scalar data. First introduced over a decade ago, this concept has since
evolved and is currently capable of two-dimensional measurements in the temperature range 200(cid:1)900 K.
At lower temperatures a single-shot spatial precision better than 4 K is possible, as is imaging at sampling
rates in the multi-kHz range. The approach is flexible, allowing, for example, techniques which probe single
particles for point measurements with a 200 mm spatial resolution. Besides many validation experiments,
the method has been applied in internal combustion engines, a falling film absorber, a high-pressure reac-
tion vessel and in enclosed wind tunnels to study various turbulent heat transfer and reactive flow
phenomena.

The objective of this article is to provide the first review of this emerging field. The focus is on 1) the
method: how has the principle of phosphor thermometry been used for flow measurements, and what
instrumentation and processing steps were implemented; 2) how phosphor particles were characterised,
and which phosphors are best-suited to temperature measurements in flows; and 3) the applications of the
technique. Throughout, and with a detailed analysis of various sources of error, the review endeavours to
compare the work and identify common aspects, advantages and limitations of the studies that led to suc-
cessful flow measurements, and therefore should serve as a guide for researchers using the method. The
article also briefly summarises the various challenges which the authors consider are key to the future
development of these diagnostics.

1. Introduction

PThe universal role of temperature in heat and mass transport pro-
cesses and chemical reactions makes it a variable of fundamental
thermodynamic importance, and much effort is directed toward the
measurement of gas and liquid temperatures. Methods that do not
disturb delicate yet sometimes hostile flow systems are preferable
and so a rich variety of optical diagnostic approaches have been
developed, especially since the advent of the laser, and used to
remotely probe the temperature of fluid flows both in-situ and in lab-
oratory scale experiments. We highlight the areas of convective heat
transfer, which underlies the exchange of thermal energy in a huge
range of engineering components and process industries, such as the

Pcooling of power generation engines and electronic microchips, oil
and gas extraction, transportation, material processing, refrigeration,
and the ventilation of buildings and transport vehicles; turbulent nat-
ural convection, which occurs in systems of geophysical interest like
the Earth’s oceans, atmosphere and mantle; and turbulent combus-
tion, where the influence of the turbulent flow field on the reaction
chemistry variously alters flame ignition, propagation, stabilisation
and extinction and may lead to dangerous flow instabilities/feedback
e.g. thermoacoustic oscillations in gas turbines, in turn affecting their
safe operation as well as the efficiency and emission of harmful pollu-
tants. Given the importance of such fluid flows in energy and com-
bustion science, and in many scientific fields beyond these, detailed
and comprehensive knowledge about them is needed. The inherent

Pcomplexity of the systems being studied means that the development
of optical measurement techniques for multiple flow variables, e.g.
pressure, chemical species, quantity representing state of mixing, e.g.
mixture fraction, specific pollutants and most especially the fluid
temperature, continues to be a crucial area of research.

PIn addition, to capture the transport processes in a flow of liquid
or gas it is necessary to measure the velocity. In many practical situa-
tions, the flow field is not the same everywhere and is turbulent, that
is, it fluctuates rapidly in space and time. Measurements that are
averaged in a temporal sense or across a volume are usually far
insufficient to capture the required physical detail. Therefore laser-
based point measurements of velocity and scalar quantities, which
are quasi-instantaneous (that is, a short measurement duration with
regard to the time scales of the fluid flow) were developed, including
laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV), laser Rayleigh scattering and coher-
ent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS). Laser diagnostics have since
advanced to two-dimensional flowfield imaging and now even into
three-dimensions, affording unprecedented insight into turbulent
flows. Thousands of measurements, each with a high spatial resolu-
tion, are contained in every image. Instantaneous snapshots of flow
structures covering a range of spatial scales are accessible by laser
imaging methods, permitting resolution of the gradients that drive
the transport of momentum, chemical species, and thermal energy.
High sampling rates of kHz-MHz are able to reveal transient turbu-
lent flow phenomena and rare events. In these ways, there are three
main uses of laser-based measurement techniques (for each we
name just a few examples from hundreds): to investigate specific
fundamental phenomena (e.g. differential diffusion of H2 in free tur-
bulent jets [1]); to provide well-documented experimental data for
comparison with numerical simulations (such as the Turbulent Non-
premixed Flame [2] and Engine Combustion Network [3] databases);
and to probe generic or specific configurations to understand particu-
lar engineering systems (e.g. combustion in Diesel engines [4]). This
last point betrays the curious fact that much vital technology such as
boilers, combustors, furnaces, heating and cooling devices, are much
older than our ability to measure or model them, and therefore fully
understand their operation.

PThough measurements of temperature and velocity are of great
value, in turbulent flows an additional and demanding capability is to
measure both variables at the same time. With this information, it is
possible to measure the turbulent transport of heat - the turbulent
diffusion terms; and also gain a deep understanding of the coupling
between the turbulent flow and various phenomena intimately linked
to the fluid temperature, for example buoyancy forces and/or rate of
chemical reactions. Joint measurements are also necessary to achieve
statistically significant measurements for nonstationary processes or
in transient flows which are not easily reproduced experimentally.
Many previous review articles of laser-based diagnostics have stressed
the value of simultaneous measurements of scalar quantities and flow
velocity [5(cid:1)8]. However, as well as combined measurements being
something of a longstanding challenge in flow diagnostics, tempera-
ture is a notoriously difficult parameter to measure.

PThe aim of this paper is to review a class of laser-based fluid tem-
perature diagnostics based on thermographic phosphors, which are
solid materials with temperature-dependent luminescence proper-
ties. Phosphor particles are seeded into the gas or liquid as a flow
“tracer”, taken to mean that they effectively match the temperature
(and velocity) of the surrounding fluid. The particles are probed
using lasers and the luminescence emission is detected using appro-
priate sensors to determine the flow temperature. By various, usu-
ally well-established velocimetry techniques, the same phosphor
particles can readily be used as a tracer to measure the flow velocity.
PThere are innumerable types of thermographic phosphors and dif-
ferent ways in which the luminescence properties are influenced by
temperature. Therefore various implementations of this general con-
cept have emerged which provide point and two-dimensional field

Pmeasurements, at sampling rates up to several kHz and covering
different temperature ranges. Especially in the last ten years, the
method has evolved into a versatile diagnostic that is finding increas-
ing use for fundamental and applied research. This paper is to the
knowledge of the authors the first review of these techniques. In this
introduction, we provide a brief overview of the measurement prin-
ciple (Section 1.1), and a short technical summary (Section 1.2)
aimed only at those interested in the main findings of this compara-
tive exercise. A short historical review of studies that used thermo-
graphic phosphors for fluid temperature measurements is then
presented in Section 1.3. To frame the emergence of this method,
Section 1.4 considers existing (state-of-the-art) techniques for tem-
perature and velocity measurements. Section 1.5 guides the reader
through the contents of the review paper.

1.1. Measurement concept

PInorganic phosphors are solid crystalline materials, generally
consisting of particles with a size in the nm to mm range i.e. in fine
powder form, which exhibit the phenomenon of luminescence. They
are used in a large variety of applications including fluorescent
lamps, night vision devices (image intensifier phosphor screens),
light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs, plasma display panels, security
labelling, optical fibers, lasers, solar cells, medical treatment (photo-
dynamic therapy) and imaging, and glow-in-the-dark materials. In
the most general sense they are used to convert incoming radiation,
e.g. X-rays, g-rays, electron beam and ultraviolet (UV) light, into
light in the visible region of the spectrum. As an example, in a fluo-
rescent lamp, a low-pressure mercury vapour produces a narrow UV
line at 254 nm under excitation by an electric arc. This harmful and
invisible radiation is absorbed by a layer of phosphor powder to pro-
duce visible luminescence.

PThis is the basic principle. Upon absorption of electromagnetic
radiation, the electrons in the phosphor material are promoted from a
ground state to a higher energy state which may then be followed by
a radiative decay (luminescence). Note that due to internal relaxation
processes, the emission is almost always spectrally shifted away from
the excitation. Depending on both radiative and non-radiative transi-
tion rates, light emission can persist for an extended time after the
excitation source is removed, ranging from sub-nanosecond to
minutes or even hours. The energy states between which radiative
transitions occur are determined by the electronic structure of the
solid material. The presence of impurities usually deliberately intro-
duced into the “host” material (for example aluminium oxide Al2O3 or
barium magnesium aluminate BaMgAl10O17) serve to change or intro-
duce completely new energy levels, leading to luminescence proper-
ties very different to that of the original insulating compound. These
“dopant” impurites are normally lanthanide (rare-earths, for example
europium (Eu), holmium (Ho) etc) or transition metal (for example
manganese (Mn), chromium (Cr) etc) ions. One can immediately see
that the variety of materials which may be termed a phosphor is
enormous. In its own right, the production of phosphors and charac-
terisation of their luminescence properties is, to quote Dorenbos, an
“unimaginably large” (and growing) field of materials research [9].

PTemperature has a strong influence on the luminescence proper-
ties. There are two main types of temperature dependence: the
change in the duration of the persistence of the luminescence after
excitation, that is, the emission lifetime; and the relative change of
the emission spectrum. Additional quantites such as the absolute
emission intensity, the luminescence risetime or the excitation spec-
trum may also be temperature-dependent [10], but those are usually
found to be of limited use in practical applications. For decades, both
the emission lifetime and spectral responses have been exploited
for remote thermometry, forming two broad classes of methods:
the time-resolved methods and the spectrally-resolved methods.
Thermographic phosphors have been extensively used for the

Ptemperature measurement of surfaces, even preceding the advent of
the laser in 1960 [10]. A thin layer of phosphor (thickness
0.5(cid:1)50 mm) is coated onto the surface of interest and typically illu-
minated with a pulsed light source. The luminescence emission fol-
lowing the excitation pulse is then detected and either the spectral
or temporal content are recorded and analysed to derive the surface
temperature. We recommend extensive review articles on the topic
[10(cid:1)12].

PFor many phosphors, there is little evidence that the lumines-
cence, which originates from centers in the solid phase, is influenced
by the pressure and composition of the surrounding fluid. Additional
benefits conferred by the materials are that they are chemically inert
and normally have a high melting point. Therefore they are very well
suited to measurements in harsh, reactive environments, and were
used as such, e.g. in internal combustion engines, afterburners, gas
turbine combustor walls (see aforementioned reviews). Further-
more, phosphors tend to possess broad excitation spectra, facilitat-
ing excitation via a range of possible light sources, including lasers
common to many laboratories, for example Nd:YAG and harmonics.
The luminescence emission of many phosphors is in the visible spec-
tral region, simplifying the signal collection and detection using
ordinary scientific cameras and detectors. The vast range of phos-
phors provides broad scope in selecting a phosphor with the right
luminescence properties for a specific application.

PFor all these reasons, thermographic phosphor particles are
clearly an attractive tracer material for temperature measurements
in fluid flows. To illustrate the basic concept early on in this article,
an example is shown in the photograph in Fig. 1. In this experiment,
the phosphor zinc oxide (ZnO) was seeded into a liquid nitrogen-
cooled jet of air. A UV laser light sheet was directed downwards
through the jet. The luminescence emission of the ZnO particles
peaks at » 390 nm in the near-visible UV spectral region. Using a
cheap mobile phone camera, this luminescence was recorded as the
bright blue-coloured light emanating from the jet, clearly visible in
this photograph. If the luminescence were detected in an appropriate
fashion, it is this same signal that yields the particle temperature.

PAs solid mm-size particles, phosphor particles also naturally
serve as a tracer material for conventional particle-based velocime-
try measurements, such as LDV or particle image velocimetry (PIV,
see Section 1.4), or even velocimetry methods also based on captur-
ing the luminescence emission of the particles. Fig. 2 shows a typical

Fig. 1. Photograph of a liquid nitrogen-cooled jet of air seeded with zinc oxide phos-
phor particles, taken with a cheap CMOS sensor. The jet flows from the pipe in the
right-left direction. A laser light sheet propagates downwards through the jet and
excites the particles, generating the luminescence which is recorded as the bright
blue colour. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the
reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

ments using thermographic phosphor particles.

Psetup for simultaneous temperature and velocity imaging. Overlap-
ping laser light sheets define the measurement plane in the flow of
interest, here a turbulent jet or flame, which is seeded with appro-
priate thermographic phosphor particles. One (ultraviolet) laser
excites the particles, which emit luminescence. Here, this signal is
detected by two cameras equipped with suitable spectral filters and
these two images are used to derive the instantaneous temperature
field. In this example ordinary particle image velocimetry is used to
simultaneously measure the velocity field, consisting of another
double-pulse (visible) laser to illuminate the same particles, and an
additional camera to detect the Mie scattering signal.

PThis method, named “thermographic PIV”, is only the most
common realisation of the method. The following section sum-
marises only the main aspects and current capabilities of the
general concept.

1.2. Technical summary

PThere are four important and linked considerations for those
interested in these diagnostics. These basically follow the structure
of the review article from Sections 3(cid:1)6. First is the approach: there
are many implementations using either temporal or spectral meth-
ods, and each provides different capabilities (see Section 3). For two-
dimensional measurements a two-camera system with beamsplitter
to obtain a two colour intensity ratio, effectively that shown in Fig. 2
above, is the most widely-used and versatile approach for instanta-
neous measurements. On short time scales, imaging methods using
the strong sensitivity of the lifetime are currently difficult to imple-
ment, primarily due to hardware limitations. However, there are
strategies for lifetime-based point measurements. Velocity measure-
ments can be performed simultaneously with the same tracer, usu-
ally using separate PIV system (for planar measurements) and LDV
(for point measurements) for greater flexibility, but there are other
ways to perform the measurements using fewer cameras and lasers,
for example using the particle luminescence for PIV.

PSecond is the choice of phosphor from a vast number of possible
materials, each with very different luminescence properties. A suit-
able phosphor should be bright, have a short luminescence lifetime
( < 10’s of ms is preferable for measurements in turbulent gas flows),
a suitable sensitivity to temperature over the range of interest and
ideally no additional sensitivities (e.g. on the excitation laser fluence
or fluid composition/pressure). A dozen phosphors (and co-doped
variants) have been used for fluid thermometry (for a concise sum-
mary, see Table 1 in Section 4 of this review), but only BAM:Eu2þ
and ZnO have been characterised and compared for a known particle
concentration [13(cid:1)17]. The main findings are that the luminescence
signal is high enough so that a moderate seeding density (1011 par-
ticles/m3) is generally sufficient for precise measurements. ZnO is
more sensitive to temperature (3(cid:1)5 times) but the drop of lumines-
cence signal with temperature is also more pronounced, and the
laser fluence has a stronger influence on the measured temperature
(a 10% variation in fluence results in a 6 K temperature change),
requiring a corrective procedure. The luminescence emission of

PBAM:Eu2þ was also shown to be independent of the oxygen concen-
tration in the range 0(cid:1)200 mbar between 300 and 920 K, and to be
unaffected by short (» 1 s) high temperature ( > 2000 K) exposures.
Similar studies of other phosphors used for fluid thermometry as
well as many others are necessary to improve the capabilities of the
technique. This may be done using methods to probe dispersed par-
ticles, described in Section 4 of this review.

PThird is sources of uncertainty (Section 5). From a theoretical
standpoint, the proof of concept stems from the ability of a solid
mm-size particle to trace the fluid temperature. Heat transfer models
show that a particle of a given size responds equally fast to changes
in flow velocity or fluid temperature, and that radiation has little
effect. The response time is on the order of 10’s ms for 1 mm spheri-
cal phosphor particles, appropriate for measurements in a range of
turbulent flows. Also, for the moderate seeding densities mentioned
above, the particles do not affect the bulk properties of the fluid. As
it stands, the most prominent sources of uncertainty are surface
luminescence from particles deposited on surfaces and multiple
scattering by dispersed particles in the fluid phase. Surface lumines-
cence puts restrictions on near wall measurements, while multiple
scattering was shown to be a serious issue when using BAM:Eu2þ in
large-volume seeded flows [16]. Further investigations are needed
to estimate its impact in specific flow configurations as well as for
other phosphors. The potential of structured laser illumination to
address both issues has been investigated [18].

PThe final consideration is the required measurement capabilities
for the intended application. In terms of temperature range, the
upper temperature limit is linked to the phosphor quenching behav-
iour and its temperature sensitivity. ZnO and BAM:Eu2þ phosphors
have been used between 300(cid:1)500 K and 230(cid:1)950 K respectively (see
Section 6). Other phosphors such as Y3Al5O12:Pr3þ; which was used in
the range 300(cid:1)900 K , Y2O2S:Er3þ;Yb3þ; in the range 300(cid:1)423 K, and
others need further characterisation of the absolute signal level to
assess their thermometric performance. In terms of spatial resolution,
200 mm can be achieved for point measurements, while for imaging
the typical reported resolution is generally lower (200(cid:1)500 mm) with
domains around several 10’s(cid:1)100 mm. The temporal resolution is typ-
ically 1(cid:1)10 Hz, but sampling rates up to 6 kHz have been achieved for
imaging [19,20] as well as for point measurement approaches using
cw lasers [21,22]. Finally concerning the temperature resolution, or
precision, approximate guidelines are provided for planar imaging
configurations: a few K over the range 300(cid:1)500 K with ZnO (which
was not tested at higher temperature) and 10(cid:1)50 K for BAM:Eu2þ
over the range 200(cid:1)920 K. For applications where precise point tem-
perature measurements are needed, higher precision (better than 1%)
is possible using lifetime-based approaches.

1.3. Historical review

PTo our knowledge, the first implementation of phosphor particles
for fluid measurements were in the 70’s, to image streaks using the
long luminescence emission of the particles [23]. However the first
known example of thermometry in fluids using thermographic phos-
phors was by Miller and Keyhani, who in 2001 performed liquid-
phase point temperature measurement in a free falling LiBr film
using the highly temperature-sensitive lifetime of the phosphor
La2O2S:Eu3þ; as part of a heat and mass transfer study of absorption
chillers [24]. This temperature diagnostic was developed jointly
with Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Tennessee, USA. It was there in
2004 that Allison et al., pioneers in phosphor thermometry on surfa-
ces, first laid out the advantages of using phosphor particles as flow
tracers [25]. On top of their list was that phosphor particles “may
yield temperature information as well as function in the usual way
as light scatterers for laser Doppler velocimetry” and that, since
phosphors usually consist of ceramic material, they are therefore
“quite robust in surviving and functioning in harsh high temperature

Penvironments”. Actually it was not until 2015 that phosphor par-
ticles were used in conjuction with LDV to yield simultaneous tem-
in 2004
perature and velocity point measurements [21], but
researchers in Lund University in Sweden explored several concepts
for fluid temperature measurements using phosphors. They used
La2O2S:Eu3þ and Mg4FGeO6:Mn4þ phosphor particles, dispersed into
water or isooctane to measure volume-averaged temperatures of
falling and levitating droplets, with the time-resolved and spec-
trally-resolved methods respectively [26,27]. Using a fast framing
camera, they extended phosphor lifetime thermometry to 2D meas-
urements inside droplets and sprays [28]. In the aforementioned
studies, the UV harmonics (355 and 266 nm) of pulsed (10 ns)
Nd:YAG lasers were used for excitation. The 2006 study of Br€ubach
et al. (at Technische Universit€at Darmstadt, Germany) was similar in
this respect, but used a two-colour intensity ratio approach to image
average temperature distributions in n-dodecane fuel sprays [29].
This basic principle, that is, pulsed laser (typically Nd:YAG) excita-
tion and two-colour imaging of different bands of the luminescence
emission, has since been used for the majority of fluid thermometry
studies. This is because it permits a short integration time (» ms),
which is usually required for adequate temporal resolution in turbu-
lent flows. These studies were in liquid flows, where the tempera-
ture range is inherently limited.

PIn 2007, the Lund research group started work in gas flows with
the main aim of operating in a reactive high-temperature environ-
ments such as internal combustion (IC) engines. At this stage, the
field of high temperature surface phosphor thermometry was
focused on phosphors with slow luminescence transitions such as
Y3Al5O12:Dy3þ (the yttrium aluminium garnet host is commonly
abbreviated to YAG) or Y2O3:Eu3þ; since the decay time (in the ms to
ms range) could be accurately measured. Due to thermal quenching
processes the luminescence signal and lifetime decreases with tem-
perature; the lifetime of YAG:Dy3þ is sensitive at temperatures as
high as 2000 K [30]. YAG:Dy3þ also shows pronounced changes of
the emission spectrum over that temperature range and so seemed a
particularly attractive option for 2D measurements using the two-
colour ratio-based approach. For this reason, this phosphor was the
initial choice of many research groups, including ours. In 2007, Hase-
gawa et al. reported 2D single-shot measurements of gas tempera-
ture [31]. They seeded 4 mm YAG:Dy3þ particles in both a heated jet
and an internal combustion engine running in homogeneous charge
compression ignition (HCCI) mode with the aim of investigating the
development of ignition kernels [32,33]. However, YAG:Dy3þ has
poor absorption characteristics, and the lifetime is 1 ms at room
temperature. Usually the luminescence signal from dispersed par-
ticles in a fluid is a limiting factor, especially at high temperatures.
Furthermore, in turbulent flows using an appropriate exposure
time on the ms-scale with a long lifetime phosphor suffers from
the rejection of the majority of the signal. These principles were
stated at the end of a 2010 paper aimed at determining the sur-
vivability of YAG:Dy3þ particles passing through a flame; these
principles have not changed since: “For future development... the
challenge is to search for a thermographic phosphor type that has
both a short lifetime and a strong signal at high temperature” [34].
A later study from Brunel University, London, UK showed that even
for a long exposure of 100 ms and YAG:Dy3þ particles as large as
10 mm, the signal was too weak for single-shot measurements,
even at room temperature [35]. Other studies from different
research groups experienced similar difficulties with low signal
levels [36(cid:1)38].

PPhosphor particles can be used as a tracer for LDV or PIV, and
indeed one of the key aspects of this measurement concept is to
measure both temperature and velocity simultaneously. Also at
Lund, in 2008, the first simultaneous measurements were reported
in a heated air jet and recirculating flows with the phosphor
Mg4FGeO6: Mn4þ [39]. Though this phosphor is much brighter than

PYAG:Dy3þ (it is used in fluorescent lamps), it also has a long lifetime
of 3 ms at room temperature [40]. Only time-average measurements
were reported since signal levels were reportedly too low.

PAround the same time, the Lund group also investigated the lumi-
nescence properties of a range of commercial phosphor powders
with fast luminescence transitions [41]. Among them were two
phosphors with the desired short lifetime ZnO:Zn ( < 1 ns), and
BaMgAl10O17:Eu2þ (1 ms), also referred to as BAM:Eu2þ. The emission
of ZnO containing gallium and excess zinc was used for temperature
measurements in burning methanol droplets [42]. BAM:Eu2þ was
mentioned at this time as a tracer to study Diesel combustion [43].
However it was not until 2012 that our research group, then at Impe-
rial College in London, UK, presented the first examples of single shot
temperature and velocity imaging using 2.4 mm BAM:Eu2þ particles
[44]. A theoretical conduction-based heat transfer analysis showed
that the ability of the particles to follow changes in fluid temperature
degrades with the square of the particle diameter [44], the same as for
the particle velocity (see Section 5.2). The same study also showed
that the phosphor spectral signature can be used to visualise the mix-
ing between two gas streams. Other groups used BAM:Eu2þ for gas-
phase temperature imaging, in a high pressure reaction vessel [37]
and in a heated jet [35]. The research group of David Rothamer at Uni-
versity of Wisconsin-Madison, USA used different phosphors, the
upconversion phosphor Y2O2S:Er3þ;Yb3þ [45] and YAG:Pr3þ [46]. The
latter was applied to image instantaneous temperature and velocity
fields in a motored IC engine [47] and in the shear layer between air
and a vitiated stream of combustion gases [48].

POur research group then demonstrated that precise single shot
temperature and velocity measurements at kHz sampling rates were
possible using the phosphor BAM:Eu2þ and high speed DPSS lasers
and non-intensified high-speed CMOS cameras [19]. Such diagnos-
tics offer comprehensive time-resolved datasets of fluid mechanical
instabilities, as demonstrated in a Von K(cid:2)arm(cid:2)an vortex stream, and
later in a gas turbine film cooling flow [20].

PIn the following years (2014(cid:1)2015), building on earlier studies
[49,50], our research efforts were directed towards quantitative
characterisation of the luminescence properties of phosphor par-
ticles dispersed in the fluid, to determine how much light a single
particle emits and evaluate potential sources of error e.g. fluid com-
position, O2 partial pressure, laser fluence [13]. Recognising that the
luminescence and thermal properties of immobile packed powders
are different from that of moving individual particles, in-situ charac-
terisation studies were performed, which in gases requires a mea-
sure of
the number density of particles [51]. This permits
comparison of different phosphors and assessment of possible intru-
sive effects of the particles. Using these tools, it was possible to iden-
tify a more than three-fold improvement in the temperature
measurement precision when using the phosphor ZnO in place of
BAM:Eu2þ at an equivalent particle number density [14]. ZnO was
since applied again in liquids [15], extending the portfolio of existing
liquid thermometry techniques.

PThe majority of the studies cited so far used the two-colour ratio-
based imaging technique. Instead, a concept for 2D measurements of
temperature and velocity based on the luminescence lifetime and a
single high-speed camera was proposed and used in a motored IC
engine [52], to resolve both the luminescence decay of the phosphor
and the displacement of the particles for PIV. An hybrid method was
explored for simultaneous temperature and velocity imaging using
Y2O3:Eu3þ; a phosphor with a long lifetime at room temperature
( > 100 ms) [53]. With an interline transfer CCD camera and an image
intensifier, the luminescence of the particles can be recorded twice
within a short time delay, which yields the particle velocity field, the
temperature being simultaneously derived from the two-colour ratio
approach. In 2015 our research group extended the LDV technique to
high-resolution simultaneous point measurement of temperature and
velocity by probing the luminescence and scattering of individual

PBAM:Eu2þ phosphor particles crossing continuous wave laser beams
[21,22].

PThe strength of simultaneous single-shot 2D temperature and
velocity measurements was exploited in 2016 in Refs. [16,20] to cal-
culate the turbulent heat flux terms u0
iT0 in gas turbine film cooling
flows and a turbulent heated jet. Such measurements are essential
to understand turbulent mixing and heat transfer phenomena. The
technique was also applied in non-premixed hydrogen flames [17].

PIt is clear that the concept of measuring fluid temperatures using
thermographic phosphor particles has seen considerable develop-
ments. The primary motivation was to seek temperature (and simul-
taneous velocity) measurement capability, as a complement to other
existing and emerging diagnostics. These are described in the follow-
ing section.

1.4. Existing techniques for temperature and velocity measurements in
fluids

PThe following outlines the state-of-the-art in temperature and
velocity flow measurements. The aims are twofold: 1) to lay out the
advantages and limitations of current diagnostics, for comparison
against methods based on thermographic phosphor particles, and 2)
to briefly discuss velocimetry techniques, which owing to their prev-
alence and long history, are given little technical attention in this
review. The review is by no means exhaustive and we only cite
examples to direct the reader towards the relevant literature. This
review will not consider thermometry in systems at the nanoscale,
i.e. submicron spatial resolution, even if they use nanophosphor par-
ticles (see reviews [54,55]). Though an important and growing field
in nanotechnology, microfluidics and biomedicine, this is beyond the
scope of this review, which is focused on fluid flows at larger scales.

PVelocimetry techniques

PLaser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) and particle image velocimetry
(PIV) are two standard techniques to measure flow velocities. For
both methods tracer particles must be added to the flow, typically in
the form of liquid droplets or for reactive flows, solid particles such
as aluminium oxide Al2O3. These particles should be chosen with a
size that is small enough, for example of the order of 1 mm for gases
[56], so that they follow the flow motion (for example, response
times are in the range 10’s of ms for a 1 mm diameter Al2O3 particles
in air, see Section 5.2). In a typical LDV experiment, two coherent
laser beams cross at a point and interfere, thereby generating a set
of fringes that defines the probe volume (typically a few hundred
mm in size). As particles traverse these fringes they scatter the laser
light, which is detected using e.g. a photomultiplier tube (PMT). The
frequency of the signal peaks contained in the “Doppler burst” is a
function of the (known) fringe spacing and velocity of the particle,
and thereby the velocity of the flow in which the particle is
entrained. LDV is able to provide high spatial and temporal-resolu-
tion measurements of one, two, or all three components of the veloc-
ity, at a point [57,58]. Thus normally the flow field must be slowly
“mapped” by traversing the LDV probe.

POn the other hand, PIV is a well-established technique for mea-
suring the flow velocity in a plane or throughout a volume, thereby
instantaneous field measurements
furnishing the insights of
described in the introduction. To obtain a single velocity field, the
seeded particles are illuminated twice in short succession, typically
using a pulsed laser (e.g.
frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser at
532 nm, as shown in Fig. 2). A CCD or CMOS camera is normally used
to image the particle Mie scattering in a dual-frame approach. An
appropriate time delay between the laser pulses is fixed for the
experiment so that the particle displacement caused by the flow
motion can be identified for each image pair. For this, images are
divided into interrogation windows and a cross-correlation algo-
rithm is then used to determine the displacement of groups of

Pparticles in each window. This yields two velocity components in the
plane of the light sheet.

PFrom an experimental point of view, PIV is a robust and compara-
tively simple technique that is very widely used for flow measure-
ments (for further details see Refs. [59,60]). It can be applied to both
very small (100’s of mm) measurement domains using microscope
objectives (micro-PIV [61]) and much larger (metre-scale) facilities
(e.g. Ref. [62]). Its versatility is further evidenced by the extensions of
the method. Using two cameras that observe the measurement plane
at different angles, the displacement of particles in the out-of-plane
direction can also be determined to measure all three velocity com-
ponents (stereo PIV [63]). Using volumetric illumination and multiple
cameras, all three velocity components throughout the volume can
be determined (tomographic PIV [64]). High repetition rate lasers
and high-speed cameras can also be used for time-resolved measure-
ments (high-speed PIV, see for example the review of B€ohm et al. for
applications in turbulent combustion [65]). Here, high repetition/
sampling rates refers to the multi-kHz range, especially important
for turbulent gas flows where 1(cid:1)10 Hz sampling rates cannot track
the flow in time. Advances in kHz-rate flow imaging diagnostics
have been in part facilitated by developments in off-the-shelf Q-
switched (i.e. pulsed) diode-pumped solid state (DPSS) lasers and
also high-speed cameras based on CMOS sensor technology. DPSS
lasers operate continuously and produce the order of100s of mJ/pulse
at repetition rates in the range 1(cid:1)10 kHz at 532 nm. Despite the two
orders of magnitude lower pulse energy compared to low repetition
rate Nd:YAG lasers, PIV can be realised at kHz rates because of the
large Mie scattering cross-section of the particles.

PWe briefly highlight particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) which,
unlike PIV, tracks the motion of individual particles. The spatial reso-
lution is no longer limited to the size of the interrogation area. PTV is
particularly suitable for measurements very near walls, where PIV is
unreliable due to decreasing particle concentration and strong veloc-
ity gradients [66].

PVelocimetry techniques that do not require solid particle seeding
are suitable for specialised applications e.g. flow tagging methods
(see for example Refs. [67(cid:1)69]) for high-velocity or large volume
flows that are impossible to seed; or magnetic resonance velocime-
try [70] for enclosed flows in complex geometries. However, due to
their advantages, especially versatility and experimental simplicity,
particle-based techniques like PIV and LDV can be considered the
methods of choice for velocity measurements in a very wide range
of fluid flows. Then, the main point is that the temperature measure-
ment approach must be compatible with such velocimetry techni-
ques, which inherently means accommodating the presence of Mie
scatterers (particles or droplets). This consideration will guide the
following overview of flow temperature measurement techniques.

PRayleigh/Raman scattering diagnostics

PRayleigh scattering thermometry is commonly used for gas tem-
perature measurements in combustion research [71,72]. For planar
measurements, a laser sheet is formed and elastically-scattered light
is imaged perpendicular to the measurement plane. The light scat-
tered by the gas molecules depends on the gas density and can be
related directly to temperature if the pressure and the gas composi-
tion are constant. A primary constraint is that the Rayleigh scattering
(cid:1)27 cm2/sr) and so the signal is orders of
cross-section is small ( » 10
magnitude weaker than the interfering scattering from surfaces
around the measurement plane or in the background. This is true
also in sooting or particle-laden multiphase flows (e.g. sprays) and
of course if particles are deliberately added as an LDV or PIV tracer.
However, the spectral overlap of the scattering signals means they
cannot be easily separated. A filtered Rayleigh scattering approach
[72,73] combines an injection-seeded Nd:YAG laser (with a very
high spectral purity, see Refs. [74,75]) and a spectrally sharp atomic
or molecular filter, e.g. iodine, to block the unbroadened narrowband

Pparticle/surface Mie scattering but transmit the broadened Ray-
leigh(cid:1)Brillouin scattering of the gas molecules. This has been used
to perform simultaneous Rayleigh temperature measurements with
PIV in premixed flames [76,77]. A second restriction is that the Ray-
leigh signal is also a function of the average scattering cross-section,
which depends on the local gas composition. In combustion this co-
dependence limits the method to situations where the scattering
cross-section is deemed to vary negligibly throughout the measure-
ment region, or the product of gas density and scattering cross sec-
tion has a known and monotonic relationship with the temperature.
Note that one-dimensional measurements of gas composition may
be performed simultaneously by Raman scattering [78(cid:1)80]. Raman
scattering is an inelastic process and occurs at shifted wavelengths
characteristic of the energy levels of the scattering molecules.
Raman scattering is a powerful technique to measure different spe-
cies. However it is an even weaker process than Rayleigh scattering
(cid:1)3), and so despite the fact that the Raman signal is
(by a factor » 10
spectrally-shifted from the probe laser the method is normally still
sensitive to interference and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) [81].

PIn the context of signal levels, for Rayleigh thermometry gener-
ally only low repetition-rate (e.g. 1(cid:1)10 Hz) frequency-doubled
Nd:YAG lasers offer a sufficient pulse energies for adequate SNR, i.e.
around 100’s of mJ/pulse. At kHz rates, the significantly lower pulse
energy of the aforementioned high-speed DPSS lasers has restricted
Rayleigh thermometry to point or line (1D) measurements [82].
Instead, specialised, usually custom-built ‘pulse-burst’ laser systems
can be used [83]. Pulse-burst lasers are limited by heat load in the
number of consecutive pulses produced (burst duration 1(cid:1)10 ms)
but can deliver pulse energies of the order 1 J at 532 nm and 10 kHz,
and can operate at even higher (MHz) rates. These have been applied
for high-speed planar Rayleigh imaging in round jets [84] and jet
flames [85], and more recently in fuel jets surrounded by a coflow to
measure temperature and mixture fraction fields simultaneously
[86].

PCoherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering spectroscopy

PCARS spectroscopy is a powerful technique to measure tempera-
ture, species concentrations and pressure, especially in hostile com-
bustion environments [87].
In a typical CARS experiment, the
frequencies of the pump and Stokes laser beams are chosen so they
resonate with the Raman frequencies of the molecule(s) of interest,
e.g. N2 in air-fed reacting flows, thereby generating a Raman coher-
ence. When a third probe beam crosses the interaction volume, the
CARS signal is produced as coherently-scattered radiation along the
geometric direction obeying the phase-matching condition. The
main advantages are that this signal, from which the gas tempera-
ture can be derived, is both directional (laser-like), and spectrally-
shifted, allowing one to avoid scattering from particles, surfaces etc.
Thus CARS has a reputation for delivering high-precision measure-
ments in very challenging situations, such as industrial coal furnaces
[88], fuel sprays [89], IC engines [90,91], gas turbine combustor
exhaust streams [92], porous burners [93] and pool fires [94], to
name but a few.

PMajor recent developments involving the use of femtosecond
and picosecond lasers for CARS spectroscopy are summarised in the
2010 review of Roy et al. [95]. Depending on the exact CARS
approach these developments are overcoming some limitations of
ns CARS, variously enabling kHz sampling rates [96], suppression of
the nonresonant background signal [97], and, in some circumstan-
ces, measurements nearly independent of the collisional environ-
ment. However, these advantages do depend upon accurate and
detailed modelling to interpret the often complex CARS signals.
Remarkable temperature precision (and species sensitivity) has
been demonstrated using, for example, advanced hybrid ps/fs-CARS
schemes (see e.g. Ref. [98]). There are also exciting prospects for

PCARS measurements using a single fs laser beam and pulse shaping
techniques [99].

PCARS spectroscopy provides instantaneous temperature meas-
urements, usually at a point, with the spatial resolution in one direc-
tion limited to » 1 mm. It has been extended to line imaging [100]
and used to study flame wall interactions [101]. With an alternative
two-laser beam method and a 2D imaging spectrometer, CARS has
been extended to two-dimensions [102(cid:1)105], with the field of view
currently limited by the laser beam dimensions in the interaction
volume and the CCD format to » 10 mm £ a few mm. Combined
LDV/CARS point measurements have been perfomed e.g. [106], with
a temporal separation between temperature and velocity samples.

PWhen measurements with a still higher precision are needed
( < 1%), for example to investigate charge cooling in internal com-
bustion engines, other non-linear techniques such as laser-induced
grating spectroscopy may be considered [107,108].

PLaser-induced fluorescence thermometry

PLaser-induced fluorescence (LIF) techniques involve the elec-
tronic excitation of an atom or molecule by the absorption of laser
light. The subsequent fast (ns) radiative decay to the ground state is
called fluorescence. The signal depends on the species concentration,
and possibly the temperature, pressure, and gas composition, per-
mitting simple detection or quantitative measurement of one or sev-
eral of these quantities. Often the fluorescence emission is spectrally
separated from the excitation wavelength, and so LIF methods are in
principle compatible with particle-based velocimetry and subject to
sufficient laser energy, can be used for planar measurements by
forming a light sheet and imaging the fluorescence at 90°. Many dif-
ferent gas-phase tracers can be used for LIF thermometry. Indium
atoms, nitric oxide (NO), organic gaseous molecules such as aromatic
hydrocarbons or ketones (e.g. toluene, acetone) are examples of trac-
ers that can be added to gas flows, while fluorescent dyes such as
rhodamine are typically used in liquids. Also, the temperature of
flame radicals e.g. hydroxyl (OH) can be probed in specific regions of
the flame. Then, according to the spectroscopic characteristics
(absorption/emission, collisional quenching, temperature sensitivity
etc) of these tracers there are many different excitation and detec-
tion schemes that can be employed for single shot temperature
imaging. In the simplest circumstances where laser fluence and
tracer concentration can be held constant, single-wavelength excita-
tion and single-colour detection can be used for thermometry by the
combined temperature-dependence of the fluorescence signal and
gas density i.e. tracer concentration. However in most practical cases
this is not so due to flow mixing, chemical reactions and additional
functional experimental considerations e.g. tracer condensation.
Therefore usually varying levels of sophistication must be intro-
duced by ratio-based measurements.

PFirst we consider atomic fluorescence methods [109] using a two-
line excitation technique based on indium. Metal salt e.g. indium chlo-
ride or indium particles using laser ablation of an indium rod [110]
are seeded into the flow which then produce indium atoms in the
flame. Generally, two tunable dye lasers drive transitions from two
different ground states to a common excited state. For each pulse,
separated by a short (100’s of ns) time delay, fluorescence from this
upper level to the opposite ground state is monitored to achieve the
desired spectral separation [111]. The ground state populations are
temperature-dependent, so the ratio of the two signals, imaged using
for example two intensified cameras, is a function of temperature.
The strong transitions of the atoms saturate fast and the technique
has been extended into the nonlinear excitation regime to improve
SNR sufficiently for single-shot measurements [112]. The technique is
limited to above » 800 K where there is a sufficient population of the
upper ground state of indium, and for stoichiometric to fuel-rich con-
ditions where indium has not been oxidised [113,114]. Such an

Papproach has been used for temperature imaging up to 2800 K in
non-premixed flames [114] and a fired spark ignition engine [115].

PIn a similar fashion, molecular tracers added to the flow e.g. NO
[116] or naturally present such as OH produced in flames or shock-
heated mixtures [117] can be used for single shot thermometry too.
Two dye lasers are tuned to probe transitions involving closely-
spaced rotational states, to cancel the tracer concentration and
quenching effects. Spectrally-shifted UV fluorescence signals are
detected using intensified cameras. For OH LIF thermometry, tem-
perature information is only available in post-flame regions
>1200 K, and bias due to the intermittent presence of OH in limited
product regions must be considered when obtaining average tem-
perature fields [118]. More detailed discussion in the context of tem-
porally-averaged temperature measurements based on these species
is given in Refs. [119(cid:1)121].

POrganic tracers are introduced into gases in various ways (e.g.
using a bubbler) so as to produce a gas mixture with some fraction
of the vapour in the flow. Organic tracers may be used for mixing
studies by directly measuring the concentration by the LIF intensity,
see the review [122]. Sufficient seeding concentrations are required,
which especially at room temperature and below may be limited by
the vapour pressure. LIF thermometry using single-wavelength exci-
tation in the UV and single-colour detection strategies may suffer
from tracer concentration inhomogeneities, as discussed for engine
applications [123,124]. In the case of toluene, to make the measure-
ment independent of tracer concentration, a dual-colour detection of
the temperature-dependent redshift of the UV fluorescence emission
can be used for ratio-based temperature imaging. Two-colour toluene
LIF has been used to obtain phase-locked measurements of the tem-
perature distribution in a motored SI engine [125]. More recently
this technique was applied at a 10 kHz repetition rate in a heated jet
of nitrogen impinging on a plate [126], where measurements up to
773 K were presented. Furthermore, it was used in combination with
PIV at 6 kHz to investigate the evolution of temperature stratification
due to wall heat transfer [127] and fuel injection [128] in a motored
spark ignition engine. Unfortunately toluene is strongly quenched by
oxygen. Using 266 nm excitation, at room temperature in air the
emission intensity is reduced by a factor of 60 compared to an inert
bath gas environment [129]. Therefore at high repetition rates where
DPSS laser energies are very low (1 mJ/pulse), the method cannot be
used for temperature measurements in air. The cited heated jet
impingement and IC engine studies were run entirely with nitrogen.
PKetones e.g. acetone, 3-pentanone may be used instead. The
quantum yield of acetone, for example, is 0.2% [122], but it is not sig-
nificantly quenched by oxygen, the signal drop with temperature is
less pronounced than for aromatics, and it has a high vapour pres-
sure (300 mbar at room temperature) permitting high seeding con-
centrations. Acetone thermometry is necessarily more complicated
because the fluorescence emission is not temperature-dependent
but the absorption spectrum is. In this case, thermometry is per-
formed with sequential excitation (in time, similar to two-line
atomic fluorescence methods above) using two wavelengths (e.g.
248 nm and 308 nm) that exploit the temperature-dependence of
the UV absorption spectrum of acetone or 3-pentanone [130(cid:1)132]
while imaging the fluorescence that follows each laser pulse
[132,133]. Acetone and 3-pentanone thermometry has been used
for simultaneous measurements of temperature and end gas distri-
bution in optically-accessible engines [132,133]. Regarding the
temperature range of organic tracer LIF, temperature calibration
measurements up to 1000 K have been performed with acetone
[130], but tracer decomposition and eventual consumption in flames
around this temperature range are a natural limitation.

PTurning our attention to thermometry of the liquid phase, a com-
monly applied planar LIF thermometry technique uses soluble dyes
e.g. rhodamine or fluorescein. To remove any dependence of the sig-
nal not originating from temperature, for example laser fluctuations

Por dye concentration, a common approach is to use a temperature
insensitive reference dye and a temperature-sensitive dye in combi-
nation, and use two-colour detection of the red-shifted fluorescence
emissions to determine the temperature by a ratio method [134].
The technique has been used to study convection [135,136] and a
blast furnace water model [137] and may be applied simultanously
with PIV using additional tracer particles, even in 3D throughout a
whole liquid volume using a rapid scanning technique [138]. This
approach affords measurements across the limited temperature
ranges encountered in liquid flows. For instantaneous measurements
using pulsed lasers, to prevent errors stemming from the saturation
of the fluorescence, care must be taken to choose a suitable dye com-
bination [139]. Dye self-absorption, photodegradation and sensitivity
to chemical environment are also necessary considerations [140].

PTemperature-sensitive particles

PLastly we address a rather different temperature sensing strategy,
where the sensor is not a species in the fluid phase but rather seeded
to the flow in the form of encapsulated particles. Thermochromic
liquid crystals (TLCs) are small particles in a typical size range
10(cid:1)100 mm that reflect light with a colour that depends, among
other parameters, on the TLC particle temperature. White light sour-
ces are used to illuminate the particles in such a way to achieve spa-
tial (i.e. forming a “sheet”) and temporal (pulsing the light source)
resolution, and images of the particles are recorded using a colour
camera [141]. Well-established methods can achieve an extraordi-
nary temperature precision of 0.01(cid:1)0.1 K, however only over a range
of a few K. The same particles can be used as a tracer to simulta-
neously obtain the velocity field [142]. The temporal resolution is
restricted by the long response times of TLCs, which include the
time required for heat transfer (conduction) from the surrounding
fluid and within the particle, but also that of the colour change,
which depends on the crystal itself [143]. Estimated response times
vary: » 10 ms for 10 mm crystals is reported in Ref. [144], making
their application in gas flows questionable. The spatial resolution in
the out-of-plane dimension is limited to several mm by the white
light illumination sources employed [142]. Additionally, the accu-
racy of (global or local) calibration strategies, the dependence of the
reflection spectrum on particle size, and hysteresis or damage due to
shear forces within the fluid flow need to be addressed to achieve
the optimum precision and accuracy.

PTemperature-sensitive particles can also be synthesised by incor-
porating a temperature-dependent luminophore (e.g. EuTTA dye)
into ion-exchange particles. These have been used as a tracer for
temperature and velocity measurements in liquids [145,146], by
using planar UV excitation of the particles and measuring the tem-
perature-dependent luminescence lifetime in 2D. Similar to TLCs,
the relatively large diameter (10 mm) of these particles restricts the
application to liquid flows.

PSummary

PThis overview illustrates some of the remarkable developments
in fluid temperature measurement techniques made in the last deca-
des. In particular, advanced laser sources have led to new measure-
ment capabilities. DPSS lasers have extended the use of PIV and also
some LIF techniques from » Hz to kHz repetition rates. Burst-mode
lasers may broaden the application of existing techniques still fur-
ther by virtue of their pulse energy being comparable with low repe-
tition rate lasers. Also, the research using fs/ps laser sources for
CARS spectroscopy has led to fascinating developments, improving
the temperature measurement accuracy and precision, and likewise
the sampling rate [95]. While no attention was given here to
absorption-based techniques, their capabilities have tremendously
improved, as described in recent PECS reviews [147,148].

PThere are, however, some circumstances where current diagnos-
tic capabilities may be advanced. The presence of tracer particles for

Pvelocimetry complicates the use of Rayleigh/Raman scattering for
simultaneous temperature measurements. Instead, if the signal con-
taining the temperature information is easily separated from the
particle Mie scattering (as is the case for the shifted emission of
most LIF tracers or the coherent signal beam of the CARS thermome-
ter), simultaneous application of PIV or LDV is in principle a possibil-
ity. On the other hand, from a practical viewpoint a significant
disadvantage is experimental complexity. LIF tracers tend to have
optical properties, e.g. specific/narrow absorption bands, ultraviolet
fluorescence emission, and cross sensitivity to the bath gas environ-
ment, that complicates excitation and detection thereby needing
high laser pulse energies, specific wavelengths or well-controlled
laser spectral profiles, and often multiple laser systems and intensi-
fied detectors. Likewise, advanced CARS techniques require special-
ised laser sources. Therefore in some measurement situations, it is
evident that the versatility of temperature measurement techniques
based on thermographic phosphor particles is advantageous.

1.5. Directions through the paper

PFor several reasons a review article is timely. First, from the fore-
going it is evident that there are many different approaches to the
execution of the basic concept, therefore Section 3 is devoted to the
method: how has phosphor thermometry been used for flow meas-
urements, what instrumentation, image processing and calibration
methods were implemented, and what are the sources of error (Sec-
tion 5). The aim is to identify common advantages and drawbacks,
and should serve as a useful guide for researchers using the diagnos-
tics. Second, we point out that only a tiny fraction of the vast range
of phosphors have been used for flow thermometry. Therefore an
introduction to thermographic phosphors is provided in the next
Section 2, with particular attention to classes of phosphor material
(semiconductors, and divalent rare-earth-doped oxides), which
were given less attention in previous phosphor thermometry
reviews but are very suitable for fluid measurements. Section 4 con-
siders which phosphors are best-suited to temperature measure-
in flows, as well as how phosphor particles were
ments
characterised and the results of these studies. Third, it is useful to
summarise the applications of the method, contained in Section 6.
Section 7 also points out the various challenges which the authors
consider are key to the future development of the technique.

2. Thermographic phosphors

PInorganic phosphors consist of crystalline compounds which are
in most cases doped with specific ions, usually lanthanides (rare-
earths) or transition metals. These substitute a small fraction of the
atoms making up the (now “host”) crystal, which act as luminescent
centres to form a single activated material e.g. Al2O3:Cr3þ; normally
known as the gemstone ruby. However, this is not always the case.
Zinc oxide ZnO or calcium tungstate CaWO4 are examples of
undoped luminescent materials, i.e. just the semiconductor or insu-
lator compounds themselves. While there is a near-endless variety
of inorganic phosphors, they generally share some common features.
Their density generally ranges from 3 to 6 g/cm3, and their volumet-
ric heat capacity from 2 to 3.5 J/cm3K which are large with respect to
gases so that only small particles (mm-size) are capable of following
the fluid motion and fluid temperature accurately. These aspects are
discussed in Section 5.2. The presence of a small fraction of dopant
ions, which normally replaces a few percent of the population of one
of the constituting atoms of the crystal, generally has little effect on
mechanical and thermal properties. Klein and Croft measured the
density, thermal conductivity, diffusivity and expansion of Y2O3,
Y3Al5O12 (YAG) and La3F3, for undoped crystals and crystals with 1%
mole Nd3þ doping [149]. Heat capacity and density were largely
unchanged, but a large difference in the thermal conductivity was

PThe first category of transitions are between the valence and con-
duction band states, called interband transitions (A as shown in
Fig. 3). An electron is promoted to the conduction band by the
absorption of excitation light. Transitions back to the valence band
lead to the recombination “edge” luminescence of semiconductors,
an example being the 387 nm emission band of ZnO at room temper-
ature, shown in Fig. 4. Such transitions are often very fast, with lumi-
nescence lifetimes below a nanosecond. Historically, the phosphor
thermometry community has made little use of the temperature
sensitivity of interband transitions. The same basic mechanism may
still be responsible for the luminescence of the primary “host” com-
pound in other cases, to use the same example, for ZnO:Zn and ZnO:
Ga. Additional to the edge luminescence, local crystal imperfections
or impurity elements may locally modify the band structure and
lead to other interesting properties, e.g. the yellow luminescence in
gallium nitride GaN, or the green emission of ZnO [150].

PBy comparison, optical transitions between energy levels belong-
ing to lanthanide or transition metal ions that are deliberately doped
into the host compound have so far found far more use for thermom-
etry, and it is probably fair to state these materials are the most com-
mon conception of what a thermographic phosphor is. Transitions
take place between electronic states of the dopant ion inside the
bandgap, as designated in Fig. 3 by intra-lanthanide transitions, B.

Pobserved for Y2O3. The melting point of most phosphors is above
2000 K (e.g. Y2O3: 2698 K, Y3Al5O12: 2238 K), which in principle
makes them useful for the study of combustion systems. Phosphor
particles are often relatively inert, i.e. broadly speaking they do not
chemically react with other materials including fluids they are
immersed in, at least over short time scales (ms-s). However, trans-
formation of the material in some environments over long time scale
(min-hours) may occur, as discussed in Section 4.4.3.

PTo summarise, given these properties, one can see why these
materials have attracted such interest as remote temperature sen-
sors. However, though the thermal and mechanical properties are
generally similar, their luminescence properties are extremely vari-
able and offer a very wide range of possibilities as sensor materials.
In the following section, a brief overview of the various mechanisms
involved in the light emission process is provided, focusing on how
the luminescence can be used for temperature measurements in
fluids.

2.1. Luminescence of thermographic phosphors

PThe luminescence processes of phosphors are complex and
involve a variety of mechanisms. Dorenbos offers a useful overview
of the electronic transitions found in phosphors by means of the dia-
gram of Fig. 3 [9]. Phosphor crystals have a wide (3(cid:1)10 eV) for-
bidden gap between the valence and conduction band. This
electronic band structure is modified by the addition of dopant ions
or impurities, leading to new or changed energy levels. Electronic
transitions which result in the absorption and emission of light vari-
ously take place between the band states of the host compound and/
or energy levels within the gap.

PFor general conceptual understanding, consider a phosphor parti-
cle that contains many luminescent centres. A very short laser pulse,
for example, provides excitation light that, upon absorption, drives
many luminescent centres to an upper excited state. The system
then returns to the stable ground state, either by emission of lumi-
nescence, or non-radiative relaxation. The depopulation of the
excited state N1(t) can be described by:

dN1
dt

1⁄4 (cid:1) WR þ WNR

ð

ÞN1

where WR and WNR are the respective radiative and non radiative
transition rates. The electronic structure of the material determines
the rates (transition probability) of these de-excitation processes.
Following the short laser pulse excitation, the time it takes for the
luminescence intensity to decay to 36.8% (1/e) of its initial value is t
D1/(WR+WNR), the aforementioned luminescence lifetime.

PExamples are transitions between 4f subshells and between the 4f
and the 5d shells in rare-earth-ion doped compounds, as well as
between d shells in transition metal doped compounds. A common
feature of these transitions is that they take place between unfilled
inner shells which receive some degree of electronic shielding from
outer shells. For this reason, the electronic structure of the free ion
plays an predominant role in the positioning of the energy levels
and therefore the luminescence emission.

PThis is particularly true for transitions within the 4f shells in lan-
thanide activated compounds. The relative position of the electronic
energy levels in any host are very similar to that of the free ion, and
the emission lines are sharp, as shown in the emission spectrum of
YAG:Dy3þ and that of YAG:Pr3þ above 450 nm in Fig 4. The energy
levels of the 4f shell for trivalent lanthanides have been measured
and are summarised in a so-called Dieke diagram [151]. It is impor-
tant to note that these electronic transitions are usually forbidden
on the basis of quantum-mechanical selection rules, in this case par-
ity forbidden, and often also spin-forbidden. The main effect is that
the luminescence decay time is usually of the order 100’s ms to ms
at room temperature. While the host hardly alters the shape and
position of the emission lines, it has a strong influence on the excita-
tion spectrum, see for example the difference in the excitation spec-
tra of YAG:Dy3þ and YVO4:Dy3þ on Fig. 4. Likewise the host also has
a strong effect on quenching processes, that is, non-radiative transi-
tions between excited and ground states, and energy transfer to the
host or between dopant ions (see below).

PTransitions between the 4f and 5d shells of lanthanides are par-
ity-allowed, featuring broad emission bands and short lifetimes.
Examples are 5d-4f transitions observed in BAM:Eu2þ; with a life-
time at room temperature of 1 ms, or in YAG:Pr3þ with a lifetime of
10’s ns. Such broad bands can be seen on Fig. 4: the band centered at
445 nm in BAM:Eu2þ and that around 325 nm in YAG:Pr3þ. The host
compound dictates the position of the emission band due to crystal
field splitting of the degenerate 5d orbitals. For example, the posi-
tion of the emission peak of divalent europium in different hosts can
range from the near UV to the red spectral region [152].

PTransitions between the d shells of transition metals show a vari-
ety of cases. Due to the degeneracy in the dn orbitals, the relative
position of the energy levels are dictated by the strength of the host
crystal field as described in so-called Tanabe(cid:1)Sugano diagrams (see
Ref. [153] for the diagram and further detail). Those transitions are
parity forbidden, but depending on the charge of the ion, its elec-
tronic configuration (d1, d3 or d5), and on the host, transitions from
the lower excited states to the ground state are either spin-allowed
or spin-forbidden. Also for some ions such as Mn2þ; the emission
wavelength is influenced by the host compound, but this is not the
case for Mn4þ. Spin-forbidden d3 transitions such as 2E ! 4A2 in
Al2O3:Cr3þ or in Mn4þ activated compounds result in a sharp emis-
sion lines with long lifetimes (several ms). On the other hand, spin
allowed transitions such as 4T2 ! 4A2 in Mg4Nb2O9:Cr3þ result in
broadband emission with a decay time of around 100 ms.

PCharge-transfer transitions involve the transfer of an electron
between the dopant ion and the host crystal (C, Fig. 3). Such transi-
tions have a high oscillator strength, and can therefore be an effi-
cient excitation pathway for 4f-4f transitions e.g. in Y2O2S:Eu3þ but
this is dependent on the host-dopant combination.

PFinally, an electron can also be transferred between two lantha-
nides, see inter-lanthanide D in Fig. 3. Er3þ;Yb3þ-doped upconver-
sion phosphors are a good example. Absorption takes place in the
infrared directly in the ytterbium states and the energy is then trans-
ferred to the erbium ion, whose transitions leads to green and red
emission lines. When co-doping facilitates the excitation process,
the absorbing ion is called a sensitiser.

PFrom the foregoing we remark that 1) in phosphors the optical
transitions take place within the crystal structure of a solid particle
and so in principle these transitions should be unaffected by the

Psurrounding environment; 2) phosphors have a rich variety of differ-
ent and often broad spectroscopic features. The consequence is they
can be excited using a correspondingly wide range of light sources,
and, since many phosphors were developed and characterised for dis-
play or lighting purposes, the luminescence is often in visible spectral
regions and can therefore be easily detected, without the need for
image intensifiers or IR sensitive cameras. If the luminescence proper-
ties of these transitions (lifetime, spectral position) are affected by
temperature, then the observation of the luminescence emission fol-
lowing excitation can in theory allow remote thermometry as follows.

PInfluence of temperature on the emission lifetime

PWith increasing temperature, higher energy vibrational modes in
the crystal lattice are populated, promoting non-radiative de-excita-
tion pathways. The increase in the rate of non-radiative transitions
results in a faster depopulation of the excited state and therefore a
shorter luminescence lifetime. There are a variety of non-radiative
de-excitation processes (crossover relaxation, multi-phonon emis-
sion, intersystem crossing, photoionisation to the conduction band),
which are also strongly dependent on the host-dopant combination.
While an in-depth discussion is beyond the scope of this article, the
understanding and predictions of those processes is an active area of
research [154]. Nevertheless, owing to the almost infinite variety of
host-dopant combinations, for phosphors that have been so far stud-
ied the drop of the luminescence lifetime with temperature occurs
over almost any temperature range from 40 to 1700 K, and with var-
ious degrees of sensitivity. Graphs gathering the lifetime versus tem-
perature characteristic of many phosphors can be found in review
articles such as Refs. [10(cid:1)12], one of which is reproduced in Fig. 22
in Section 4 of this article.

PInfluence of temperature on the emission spectrum

PTwo broad categories of changes in the emission spectrum with

temperature may be identified.

PThe first is a change in the bandshape of luminescence emission
i.e. one
spectra involving several distinct electronic transitions,
emission line grows relative to another. A well-known example is
YAG:Dy3þ; where the light emission originates from transitions from
two closely spaced levels 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 separated by 1000 cm-1 and
located above a large gap of 7500 cm-1, as shown in Fig. 5. With
an increase in temperature, emission from the higher level 4I15/2
increases with respect to the lower one 4F9/2, so that a Boltzmann
distribution of electrons between these two emitting states is

Pproposed as an explanation for this behaviour. Feist and Heyes fitted
the ratio of measured emission intensities of the two lines to a Boltz-
mann distribution and extracted an energy difference of 1100 cm-1, a
value only 10% higher than that reported for the free ion [155]. They
also pointed out that Sm3þ shows a similar arrangment of energy
levels also shown in Fig. 5, which is also reflected by a temperature
induced bandshape change of the emission spectrum as observed in
Y2O2S:Sm3þ. However, in this case, there is little agreement with the
Boltzmann distribution, presumably due to the presence of low lying
charge transfer states in the Y2O2S host, allowing a non-radiative
transfer between the two levels.

PChanges in the emission bandshape are also found for Pr3þ doped
in YAG and Y4Al2O9 (YAM) hosts. In Pr3þ; the 3P0 state is located
4000 cm-1 above the 1D2 state, itself 7000 cm-1 above the 3Hj ground
states, as shown in Fig. 6. Jordan and Rothamer noticed that in the
YAG host, the ratio of the 1D2 ! 3H4 to 3P0 ! 3H4 transitions
increases from room temperature to 1100 K, followed by a decrease
in the 1100 to 1400 K range [46], which clearly disagrees with a
Boltzmann distribution. The emission spectrum of YAG:Pr3þ at room
temperature is displayed on Fig. 4. Kaczkan et al. later proposed a
mechanism based on two competing cross-relaxation processes
between neighboring Pr3þ ions [156], which is likely to be responsi-
ble for such non-monotonic behaviour. A less pronounced band-

PThe second type of spectral change is a shift and/or broaden-
ing of the emission band, and is observed in 5d-4f transitions, as
well as for interband transitions, both consisting of a single
broad emission band (see the emission spectra of BAM:Eu2þ and
ZnO on Fig. 4). For 5d-4f transitions, with increasing temperature
higher vibrational levels of the excited state are populated, leading
to a broadening of the emission band via electron-phonon interac-
tion [158], as shown in Fig. 7 for BAM:Eu2þ. In such transitions, the
position of the lower 5d state depends strongly on the crystal field,
so that anisotropic thermal expansion can have a complex effect
on the position of the emission peak, which may be responsible for
the subtle blue-shift observed in BAM:Eu2þ with increasing tem-
perature. With increasing temperature, the bandgap of semicon-
ductors tends to decrease, with contributions from electron-
phonon coupling and lattice expansion [159]. As a result, the near-
edge luminescence band shifts toward longer wavelengths as
observed in ZnO [14], see Fig. 9.

PIn some cases, quantum mechanical explanations provide a quali-
tative understanding of the observed behaviour. However, the com-
plexity of the processes involved is such that a quantitative
prediction is generally not possible. As a result, the luminescence

Pproperties of the material must be tested and if deemed suitable for
thermometry, a calibration of their response is necessary to convert
the measured quantity (lifetime or intensity ratio) to temperature.

2.2. Desirable luminescence properties for flow temperature
measurements

PAmong the almost infinite range of phosphor materials, it is
important to define the luminescence properties which allow pre-
cise and accurate measurements of fluid temperature.

P(cid:3) Efficient excitation. Excitation via transitions with a high transi-
tion probability is necessary to allow sufficient laser light to be
absorbed by the particles. For example,
for the phosphor
YAG:Dy3þ; 355 nm excitation has a rather poor overlap with a
spin allowed parity forbidden 4f-4f transition. For the same dop-
ant in a YVO4 host, an efficient excitation pathway via a host
charge transfer transition is possible at the same laser wave-
length, which leads to much higher signal levels.

P(cid:3) Quantum efficiency. A high conversion efficiency of the absorbed
light to the emission line probed is desired. The quantum effi-
ciency of phosphor used in fluorescent lamps, e.g. BAM:Eu2þ or
Mg4FGeO6:Mn4þ tend to lie in the range 50(cid:1)100 % [158]. In
YAG:Pr3þ; when probing the abovementioned 4f-4f transitions, a
large fraction of the absorbed light is lost to a 5d-4f transition cen-
tered around 325 nm, as can be observed on the emission spec-
trum of YAG:Pr3þ shown on Fig 4.

P(cid:3) Fast rate of radiative transition. For measurements in turbulent
gas flows, the measurement duration must be limited to a few
microseconds, to prevent any displacement of the particles dur-
ing the measurement caused by the fluid motion which would
result in spatial averaging. The use of phosphors with fast transi-
tions (e.g. BAM:Eu2þ; 1 ms or ZnO, < 1 ns) ensure that the entire
luminescence emission resulting from the excitation by a single
laser pulse is integrated in time. Probing spin and parity for-
bidden 4f-4f transitions at these time scales would mean collect-
ing only a few percent of the total luminescence intensity.

P(cid:3) High sensitivity to temperature, that is, a pronounced change of

the emission spectrum or lifetime with temperature.

P(cid:3) Absence of cross sensitivity of the emission spectrum or lifetime
on parameters such as the excitation fluence, gas composition
or pressure, to minimise uncertainty linked to variations in
those parameters.
PThis method probes a dilute dispersion of particles. For a given
particle number density (i.e. seeding density) the three processes of
excitation, energy transfer between different states/ions and

Pemission dictate the light level. Depending on the luminescence
mechanism, each of these three processes can affect the signal by
several orders of magnitude, and so the light level emitted by single
particles will vary enormously from one phosphor material to
another. Measuring the luminescence signal of phosphor particles is
therefore essential to establish the feasibility of using a given phos-
phor for precise temperature measurements. This is discussed in
Section 4.4.1.

PSome other properties are also favourable in some environment

or measurement situations:

P(cid:3) Long-wavelength excitation. While most phosphors can be
excited by UV radiation e.g. a frequency quadrupled Nd:YAG
laser at 266 nm, the use of such short wavelengths has disadvan-
tages. It can lead to the luminescence of metal or glass surfaces,
or to the luminescence and/or photo-dissociation of species
present in fuels. In addition, for measurements at kHz-repetition
rates, the thermal loading of frequency mixing crystals in diode
pumped solid state lasers or pulse burst systems significantly
reduces their lifetime. When possible, excitation nearer the visi-
ble spectrum is preferred, for example the third harmonic of a
Nd:YAG laser (355 nm). A few phosphors have excitation path-
ways in the visible (e.g. Cr3þ in high crystal field hosts) or infra-
red range (upconversion phosphors, e.g. host co-doped with
Yb3þ and Er3þ) of the optical spectrum, which offer interesting
perspectives in media with high UV absorption, or to avoid fluo-
rescence from the fuel and solid surfaces.

P(cid:3) Decay time in the ms range. In some cases, temporal separation
from fast fluorescence from e.g. fuel species is desired, which
can be achieved by gating the camera exposure 10’s of ns after a
short (10 ns) laser pulse when using a phosphor with a decay
time on the ms scale.

P(cid:3) Emission in the blue spectral region. In some combustion appli-
cations, an emission spectrum in the blue region is preferred to
minimise interference from blackbody radiation of soot particle
or surfaces. The blue region also allows efficient detection by
non-intensified cameras in comparison with emission peak in
the 300(cid:1)400 nm range.

2.3. Phosphor synthesis and sourcing of tracer particles

PWhile a huge range of phosphors have been synthesised, nearly
all of them were produced for the previously-mentioned applica-
tions, especially lighting and displays. Therefore the vast majority of
phosphors are optimised for these purposes, where the temperature
dependence of the luminescence emission is usually seen as detri-
mental to performance. However, studies frequently appear in the
literature which report synthesis of phosphors which show a poten-
tially useful temperature response. These normally focus only on the
temperature sensitivity and rarely on realistic experimental consider-
ations, or the overall signal level and its temperature dependence.
Rather more useful are research efforts to synthesise phosphors spe-
cifically for surface temperature measurements [160(cid:1)163], because
they also place emphasis on practical excitation sources, measure-
ment duration, sensitivity to interfering signals etc. Also, in the case
of flow measurements, the particle size, shape and state of agglomer-
ation impose more stringent requirements. These latter parameters
are primarily a function of how a phosphor powder is manufactured.
PHigh temperature solid-state reactions are used to produce the
majority of rare-earth/transition metal doped phosphors. The pre-
pared material precursors including host compound, dopant, and
sensitiser elements, plus flux(es) to try and obtain product powders
with the desired particle diameter, morphology and crystallinity are
thoroughly blended/mixed (see Ref. [158], the “Phosphor Hand-
book”, a text of reference in the phosphor community). These are

Pthen fired in a furnace, often in a controlled atmosphere e.g. oxidis-
ing, inert, or reducing depending on the necessary reactions (Ref.
[164], the book “Inorganic Phosphors”, contains instructions of how
to make thousands of phosphors). Diffusion, crystal formation and
particle growth take place. Additional firing may be used to control
oxidation state and host compound phase. The product particles
usually emerge in the form of a sintered cake. Controlling the parti-
cle size and morphology is difficult and it depends on the quantities
and particle sizes of the raw materials, the fluxes used, and firing
conditions, and then washing, grinding/milling, sieving steps to
obtain the final powder (see phosphor synthesis process diagram in
Ref. [158] p343). Solid-state methods are employed in the manufac-
ture of lamp, display, CRT and scintillator phosphors. Depending on
the relative expense of the phosphor to be made and the nature of
the luminescence excitation, particles between 1 and 10 mm are pro-
duced for maximum efficiency. The powders generally have a broad
size distribution and varying shape and state of agglomeration (see
Fig. 8 for images of BAM:Eu2þ and ZnO particles). Using sieving or
sedimentation to separate powders is expensive and inefficient for
particles in the mm size range. Hard milling to reduce the primary
particle size may damage the phosphor, reducing the efficiency
[158,164], so it is recommended to produce particles with a size dis-
tribution centered at a suitable size in the first place.

POther condensed-phase methods to prepare phosphor particles
include wet chemical techniques and combustion synthesis. There
are techniques to prepare films for surface temperature measure-
ments that do not rely on mixing prepared powders with a binder,
such as the sol-gel method, and physical and chemical vapour depo-
sition techniques [12]. Also relevant are methods including pure
gas-phase synthesis, for example to manufacture zinc oxide, where a
flow of vapourised zinc reacts with oxygen to form ZnO particles
(see Fig. 8), as well as techniques often employed to make nanopar-
laser-heated evaporation, flame synthesis, flame
ticles, e.g.
(-assisted) spray pyrolysis. In terms of producing seeding material,
these methods may offer flexibility in terms of particle size distribu-
tion, morphology, crystallinity and production scale-up.

PAt this stage nearly all phosphor particles used for gas thermom-
etry were synthesised via solid state reactions. These are generally
obtained from lighting companies (Philips, Osram) or specialists like
Phosphor Technology in the UK. It can be seen that it is not always
possible to obtain particles with a size and shape tailored for flow
tracing. It would be great value to systematically and independently
vary critical parameters such as the dopant, dopant concentration,
host etc., and also the particle size, to optimise the materials for the
application, for example, high irradiance pulsed excitation and maxi-
mum absorption. Though there have been some insightful studies
aimed at systematic characterisation [41,165,166], most phosphors
have not yet been characterised in the context of thermometry.
Comparing different phosphors is not trivial, particularly in terms of
absolute signal levels, because the absorption/scattering characteris-
tics can lead the results to depend on the state of agglomeration of

PA frequently asked question is ‘what health and safety precau-
tions must one take when seeding phosphor particles into flows?’.
The answer is that, while it is true that many phosphors are consid-
ered chemically stable and non-toxic, since they are nm- to mm-
scale particles dispersed as a dilute aerosol they pose a risk of inhala-
tion, with potential and unknown health implications. Specific phos-
phors also possess more significant or particular hazards,
for
example zinc oxide is harmful to aquatic life in high concentrations
and should be discarded using appropriate waste disposal channels;
CdWO4 used in Ref. [167] for surface measurements is considered
carcinogenic by European Council regulations, and should be used
with great caution if the material is stably adhered to a test surface,
and likely not at all in flows but for the smallest-scale, fixed-volume
fluid measurements. Wearing a respirator with appropriate particle
filters and gloves whilst directly handling phosphor powder, ade-
quate general ventilation, extraction system for gas flows with
appropriate outside exhaust and particle filters, proper procedures
for storage, disposal and spillage (HEPA filtered vacuum cleaner, for
example) are all routinely employed in our lab.

3. Methods and instrumentation

PThis section describes how the temperature dependence of the
luminescence properties of thermographic phosphors is utilised in
experiments to derive the fluid temperature. The first part compares
the temporal and spectral methods for flow measurements. This is
followed by a description of the instrumentation used in terms of
light sources, detectors and optics, their implementation, and finally
the various post-processing steps. Some of the sections apply only to
certain fluid thermometry approaches. This section serves as a point
of reference for those wishing to use phosphor particles in flows,
and need not necessarily be read in order.

3.1. Principles of phosphor thermometry

PAs discussed, the two useful temperature response of thermo-
graphic phosphors are the luminescence decay time and emission
spectrum. The raw luminescence intensity is also temperature
dependent, but to use this for thermometry would require, as in the
single-wavelength detection tracer LIF approach, a uniform distribu-
tion of the tracer in the fluid. This condition is particularly difficult
to meet, especially when seeding particles into gas flows.

P3.1.1. Spectral method

PFor the spectral method , the temperature dependence of the
emission spectrum is exploited using interference filters, as shown
in Fig. 9. In the simplest form, the luminescence emission following
excitation is simultaneously acquired using two detectors, each hav-
ing a specific spectral response defined by the optics/detectors. The
filters are chosen so that the intensity ratio of the two signals is a
function of temperature, which is in theory independent of the exci-
tation light intensity and seeding density. For imaging, a thin excita-
tion light sheet is formed and the luminescence emission of the
particle field is imaged on two separate sensor arrays. With this
approach, a single exposure is sufficient to derive the temperature
field. The key aspect of this method is that the integration time can
be made as short as the detector permits, bearing in mind that if the
luminescence lifetime is long, a short exposure will (drastically in
some cases) reduce signal levels. This is by far the most widely-used
configuration for phosphor thermometry in fluids.

PFor ratio-based measurements at a point (or line), the ratio of two
regions of the spectrum recorded with a spectrometer can be used, e.
g. [26]. Another point measurement approach was developed (“ther-
mographic LDV”), where individual phosphor particles traverse a

bands are superimposed on the spectrum; the intensity ratio of the red divided by
blue channels increases with temperature. Reproduced from Ref. [14] with permission

Pfocused continuous wave laser beam. The luminescence is collected
and then spectrally separated and directed towards two photomulti-
plier tubes, producing luminescence burst signals which can be
divided on a per particle basis [21].

P3.1.2. Temporal method

PThe temporal method consists of temporally resolving the decay
of the luminescence intensity following the excitation laser pulse.
This method has been employed for point measurements using
PMTs and two-dimensional measurements on surfaces using high
speed CMOS cameras. By reducing the region of interest on the cam-
era chip, frame rates approaching 1 MHz can be achieved. As an
example, the Photron SA1.1 camera used in [169] allows a frame
rate of 675,000 fps for a region of 64 £ 16 pixels. If the lumines-
cence lifetime over the temperature range of interest varies in the
range 50 ms(cid:1)3 ms (e.g. Mg4FGeO6:Mn4þ in the range 300(cid:1)900 K as
shown on Fig. 10), then operating the camera this way permits the
resolution of each luminescence decay with at least 100 datapoints
over the full range of lifetimes, allowing a 2D determination of the
lifetime with a reduced spatial resolution but a high precision. In the
thermal quenching range where the lifetime rapidly drops with tem-
perature, e.g. 700(cid:1)800 K for Mg4FGeO6:Mn4þ; this approach permits
measurements with a precision as good as 1 K, [170]. The point is
that the lifetime is a very sensitive function of temperature, and this
technique takes advantage of that by covering a wide range of life-
time. However the integration time (» 1 ms) is too long for measure-
ments in turbulent fluids.

PSomeya et al. explored a 2D lifetime imaging concept for gas-
phase measurements using a pulsed laser and four consecutives

Plifetime of the 5D2 line used is 12 ms at room temperature) to image
the temperature in falling droplets and sprays [28]. These measure-
ments are discussed in Section 6.1. A precision as high as 0.6 K could
be obtained over the temperature range 290(cid:1)340 K. Even in this case,
in the spray, it was reported that the particles moved during acquisi-
tion leading to measurement errors. For slower flows, high-speed CCD
cameras (frame rates around 1 MHz) or even a simple dual-frame tem-
poral ratio approach using an interline-transfer CCD camera are possi-
bilities. The latter method was tested using the YAG:Dy3þ phosphor
and a dual-frame intensified CCD in a calibration furnace and in pre-
mixed flames, albeit using two very long exposures (0.5 ms) [36].

PFor point measurements the luminescence decay waveform of
particles in the fluid phase can be temporally resolved with a much
faster data rate by PMTs as in e.g. heated jets [31,39] and water drop-
lets [26,27]. In those studies, a pulsed laser was used, which means
that point measurements are obtained at low sampling rate (10 Hz).
As mentioned above, with this Eulerian approach, particles entering
the probe volume during the decay time have not been excited, and
the luminescence from particles leaving the volume is no longer col-
lected. For phosphors with a long lifetime, the decay waveform can
be significantly distorted by this effect. A recent study has demon-
strated a point-based method for gas phase temperature and veloc-
ity measurements using excitation with the time-modulated output
of a cw laser. The temperature was infered from the temperature
dependent phase shift between the luminescence and scattering
waveforms from single BAM:Eu2þ phosphor particles crossing the
probe volume [22], which is a function of the lifetime and the modu-
lation frequency. With this approach, the sampling rate is dictated
by the rate of particles crossing the probe volume, and can be as
high as several kHz. Using a modulation frequency of 1 MHz, the
phase shift of BAM:Eu2þ particles was probed in the range 600 K -
850 K where the lifetime changes from 1 ms to 50 ns [42]. For this
range of lifetime, the particle displacement is not a problem. An
example of simultaneous Doppler, Mie-scattered excitation and
luminescence emission bursts recorded as a single particle crosses
the probe volume at a temperature of 840 K is shown on Fig. 12.
Here the frequency of the Doppler burst is function of the velocity,
while the frequency of the excitation and emission burst is the UV
laser modulation frequency, here 1 MHz. The phase shift between
excitation and emission is measured to derive the temperature. A
measurement precision of about 1% could be obtained at 835 K. An
important feature of this approach is that by adjusting the frequency
of the modulation frequency, the sensitivity of the phase-shift can
be tuned by virtue of the tan(cid:1)1 function [22], allowing very precise
measurements in specific temperature ranges.

PSince the decrease of the luminescence lifetime is the result of an
increase in non-radiative transition rate, there is a compromise

Pexposures of a high speed CMOS camera as described in Fig. 11. This
approach was applied for temperature and velocity measurements
in a motored internal combustion engine over the range 620 to
820 K [52]. After each laser excitation pulse, 4 images of the lumines-
cence signal of Mg4FGeO6:Mn4þ particles seeded into the flow were
recorded within 100 ms starting 5 ms after the laser pulse. The dis-
placement of the particles between the 4 images was used to deter-
mine the velocity field using PIV. During motored operation of the
engine, at top dead centre (TDC), the measured in-cylinder gas tem-
perature is about 820 K, at which the luminescence lifetime of the
phosphor is 50 ms (see Fig. 10). Under these conditions, four frames
are evenly distributed over the 1/e2 decay waveform, allowing a
very precise evaluation of the lifetime. A single-shot pixel-to-pixel
standard deviation better than 5 K is reported. At 30 crank angle
degrees (CAD) before top dead center (BTDC), the gas temperature is
600 K and the luminescence decay time is 1.7 ms, which means only
a small fraction (» 6%) of the decay is covered by the four exposures.
As a result, the difference in recorded intensities is less than 5% so
that the lifetime evaluation is very sensitive to random errors in the
intensity of each exposure. While allowing highly precise measure-
ments, this 4-frame concept is inherently limited to a narrow range
of lifetimes, and hence temperatures.

PThe concept also relies on the fact that the displacement during
the 100 ms measurement is sufficient for particle image velocimetry
but small enough for the temperature change to be negligible. This
assumption is acceptable in this slow-moving in-cylinder engine
flow with velocities in the range 0-0.7 m/s [52], and also in some liq-
uid flows where for example a similar approach was used by Kim
et al. [171]. However significant errors may arise in faster flows. At
higher flow velocities, in addition to averaging errors, adopting an
Eulerian approach means that the decay time is evaluated from dif-
ferent particles which may have different luminescence intensities
or which have been exposed to different excitation fluences. A
Lagrangian “tracking” approach is prefered in such cases, where the
luminescence intensity of each particles or group of particles is
tracked in time following the laser pulse.

POperating at faster frame rates would allow shorter measure-
ment times necessary for turbulent flows. In the single-camera
approach described by Someya, this would further reduce the
already limited resolution (512 £ 256 pixels) used for the PIV evalu-
ation. Then, the velocimetry should be performed with a separate
camera and laser system, see Section 3.2.6.

PIt does not seem likely that the extraordinary sensitivity of the
lifetime can be exploited over a wide temperature range (100’s K) in
turbulent flows. However, a phosphor with lifetime varying in the
range 1(cid:1)10 ms over a smaller temperature range of interest would
open interesting perspectives for precise thermometry in a wider
range of applications. For example an ultrafast framing camera run-
ning at 100 MHz was used with the La2O2S:Eu3þ phosphor (the

Pbetween the temperature sensitivity and the signal level. A phosphor
with slow luminescence transitions which is far in its thermal
quenching regime (e.g. TiMg2O4:Mn4þ at room temperature) would
show a suitable range of lifetime (1(cid:1)10 ms), but also an inherently
low quantum efficiency, leading to poor signal levels in fluid flows.

PIn conclusion, the lifetime method is a potential option for high-
precision thermometry over a narrow temperature range, but phos-
phors with an appropriate lifetime and signal levels over the tem-
perature range of interest must be carefully chosen.

3.2. Instrumentation

P3.2.1. Particle seeding

PTo be able to measure the fluid temperature using thermographic
phosphor particles, the particles must be dispersed in the fluid i.e.
into a tank of liquid, or into a gas flow upstream of the test section.
As will be discussed in Section 4.4.1, for some phosphors it has been
established that the range of seed concentration required for precise
temperature measurements is 1010(cid:1)1012 particles/m3, which trans-
lates to 0.02(cid:1)2 g/m3 considering 1 mm spherical particles with a
density of 4 g/cm3.

PThe dispersion of particles in liquid streams is in principle rela-
tively straightforward. Early studies reported simply mixing the
powder into the liquid [26(cid:1)29] and also often continuous stirring of
the dispersion. A small quantity of surfactant was reported to aid
dispersion of La2O2S:Eu3þ in water [28]. It should be noted that the
mass load was usually stated to be around 1% by weight which is
very high (10 g/L in water) compared to the value stated above (see
Section 4.4). Our findings were that in water and using ZnO phos-
phor powder even vigourous stirring does not break up large
agglomerates which remain visible on the bottom of the vessel [15].
Laser diffraction measurements showed that the particle size distri-
bution in this case was bimodal, with some large agglomerates in
the range 10(cid:1)100 mm. Therefore a procedure was developed to add
particles to the liquid (» 0.1% by weight) and disperse the particles
using an ultrasonic homogeniser to generate a turbid mixture. This
is diluted in subsequent steps to end up with mass loads in the range
1(cid:1)5 mg/L, which is clear to the eye in an ordinary 1 L laboratory bea-
ker. It was verified using laser diffraction measurements that follow-
ing this method no large agglomerates remain [15]. Ultrasound
actuators were also used to continously disperse YAG:Dy3þ and
YVO4:Eu3þ in Jet-A/water mixtures [38,172].

PAs Self and Whitelaw wrote in 1976, “the dispersion of micron-
size solid particles into gaseous flows can be achieved in various
ways ... but it is not entirely straightforward to achieve a steady, con-
trolled feed of deagglomerated particles” [173]. In fact, Geldart’s clas-
sification of powders indicates that phosphor particles in the
1(cid:1)10 mm range belong to the group C of “cohesive powders” which
cannot form a fluidised bed in a strict sense [174]. Instead group C
powders tend to form channels, resulting in an unsteady rate of
entrainment of the powder and the presence of many agglomerates.
In this respect, only a basic and qualitative understanding of the dis-
persion and de-agglomeration processes combined with the observa-
tion of the “seeding quality” in terms of seeding level, uniformity and
consistency over time form the grounds for guidelines. Few research
articles provide a discussion on seeding tracer particles, the article of
Melling being so far the most extensive [56], while Ref. [175] provides
additional discussion on seeder design and particle deposition.

PIn terms of seeders, the apparatus designed for PIV/LDV seeding
are directly applicable here, since the physical properties of phos-
phors and PIV/LDV seeding materials e.g. Al2O3, TiO2 are very similar.
The simplest seeder design consists of two plenums separated by a
sintered plate on which the powder rests. This would allow the for-
mation of a fluidised bed (as these seeders are usually referred to)
when fluid flows upwards through it. The concentration in seeding
particles is then controlled by the ratio between the stream that goes

Pthrough the seeder, and the stream that bypasses it. While it is
tempting to design one’s own fluidised bed seeder, from our experi-
ence, it proved extremely difficult to produce a steady stream of
seeding. Some large fluidised bed seeders (e.g. PIVtech PIVsolid
seeders) operate rather reliably, but are generally limited to flow
rates above 50 L/min and seems to require large quantities of powder
( > 2 kg). Another concept is based on a reverse cyclone separator as
presented by Glass and Kennedy in [176] (Fig. 13) but no commercial
systems are available. Due to the two counter-rotating vortices, large
agglomerates which are entrained at first should be collected at the
bottom of the seeder (underflow), while smaller particles exit with
the fluid through an aperture at the top of the vessel. With our in-
house built reverse cyclone seeder, we observed a steady seeding
density at flow rates above 200 L/min. For both seeder designs, lower
carrier gas flow rates result in an insufficient concentration of seed-
ing particles. Hybrid concepts based on both mechanical stirring
using a rotating magnet and a swirling flow (e.g. LaVision particle
blaster), have shown satisfactory results from 10 to 50 L/min. A range
of powder dispersers for dust particles for applications in particle fil-
ter quality testing have been developed commercially (BEG 1000,
Palas; 3400A, TSI; SAG 410, Topas GmbH), some of which have been
specifically designed for cohesive ceramic powder. Systems based on
a belt with grooves to transport the powder from the feeder to a
fluid nozzle where it is entrained in the fluid may provide accurate
particle feed rate and therefore concentration. To our knowledge,
none of these systems are rated for a carrier gas flow rate below
5 L/min, and seeding lower flow rates remains very challenging.

PAs for other methods for seeding phosphor particles, Omrane
et al. dispersed phosphor particles in alcohol, then sprayed the solu-
tion in the gaseous stream using a nebuliser, which was then
directed to a heated tube causing the liquid to evaporate [39]. In this
case the seeding density was reported to be too low, and highly
inhomogeneous. Concerning other seeding devices, we note the use
of a screw feed causing the powder to fall in a cross stream of carrier
gas [46,47], a fluidised bed from which the gas is sucked toward the
outlet of a venturi tube [37], and particles placed above a loud-
speaker [36].

PTo reduce the presence of agglomerates entrained in the flow,
several steps have been reported. First in terms of powder prepara-
tion, the application of a SiO2 or Al2O3 nanoparticle coating (e.g.
Ludox or Aerosil) reduces agglomeration. For BAM:Eu particles, this
coating was shown to have no effect on the emission spectrum [177]
but the study may not have been sufficiently sensitive (see Sec-
tion 4.4.4). It has been confirmed that there is no effect of SiO2 parti-
cle coating on the emission of YAG:Dy particles [43]. Experience
shows that drying the particles in an oven at about 150 °C for several
hours before use removes excess moisture which favours coagula-
tion. Downstream of the seeding device, de-agglomeration or size
selection can be achieved using a sonic (or subsonic) nozzle to break

Pagglomerates through shear forces or particle impactors [46,47]
which promote the deposition of large particles and offers some
degree of particle size selection. We emphasise that seeders with
some degree of swirl such as the cyclone seeder described above
tend to reduce the occurence of large particles in the aerosol.

P3.2.2. Light sources

PSince the luminescence must be collected within a short time
period relative to the flow motion, a sufficient signal level requires
high pumping rates and high luminescence emission rates, which
are achieved with high power density pulsed lasers, and phosphors
with a short lifetime. Pulsed lasers with pulse durations in the range
of tens to hundreds of nanoseconds and pulse energies up to 1 J offer
very high power densities which allow a fast pumping of the excited
state. It was stated before that most phosphors have a broad excita-
tion spectrum, which means it is generally not necessary to tune the
laser emission wavelength, e.g. with a dye laser. With either fre-
quency-tripled or frequency-quadrupled Nd:YAG lasers (355 and
266 nm respectively), it is possible to excite many phosphors, which
is a significant advantage of these tracer materials. The pulse ener-
gies of commercially available Nd:YAG lasers typically reach 100’s
of mJ at low repetition rates (10 Hz). By adding a non-linear fre-
quency conversion crystal, a common PIV laser can be converted to
deliver either UV outputs. On the other hand upconversion phos-
phors require IR excitation which may be useful to reduce photolytic
interferences and also for biomedical applications, to target the so-
called biological windows, spectral bands where the scattering and
absorption of biological tissue is minimal. For gas thermometry, in
Ref. [45] a frequency-doubled Nd:YAG OPO/OPA was used to excite
the upconversion phosphor Y2O2S:Er3þ;Yb3þ at 980 nm.

PThe amount of energy required depends on the tracer material
used. Our studies of BAM:Eu2þ and ZnO showed that a pulse energy
of only 1(cid:1)2 mJ is sufficient for precise measurements over a region
(field of view) of 5 £ 5 cm by a sheet thickness of a few hundred
mm, corresponding to a fluence around 10 mJ/cm2, as discussed in
Section 4.4.1. However a very wide range of fluences have been used
in different studies, often 100’s of mJ/cm2 ([178]) and sometimes in
excess of 1 J/cm2 [49], presumably because some phosphors other-
wise emit very little light.

PFor measurements at kHz repetition rates, diode pumped solid
state lasers (DPSS) with a pulse energy of 1(cid:1)5 mJ at 355 nm can be
used [19,20]. Note that frequency tripling or quadrupling is not
straightforward with these lasers. Often DPSS lasers have a pulse
duration of >100 ns, and use intra-cavity frequency conversion. Slab
lasers, e.g. those supplied by Edgewave GmbH, have a short (» ns)
pulse duration and the wavelength is converted outside the cavity.
In general, the 355 nm line is preferred if the phosphor allows it,
since this reduces photolytic interferences, does not require fused
silica optics, and is less prone to heat load and thermal lensing. This
latter consideration is especially true at high repetition rates. The
advantage that some phosphors (e.g. ZnO, BAM:Eu2þ) require very
little laser fluence is critical in the application of the measurement
technique at high repetition rates. Phosphors demanding high fluen-
ces cannot be used with DPSS lasers because the energy output is
2(cid:1)3 orders of magnitude lower than from 10 Hz lasers. In that case,
pulse-burst systems [83,179] could be used instead but these are
expensive and the total number of pulses per measurement
sequence is limited. They may also lead to significant laser-induced
heating of the particles due to the high energy delivered over a short
duration. The influence of the excitation fluence on the lumines-
cence properties of phosphor particles is discussed in Section 4.4.4.

PLooking at other light sources, for the thermographic laser Dopp-
ler velocimetry concept, the Mie scattering and luminescence signals
from individual particles passing through a probe volume are
detected. The probe volume is formed by two crossing continuous
wave green beams and a continuous wave UV beam at 375 nm [21].

PA diode laser with a continuous output of 65 mW was used, which
for a particle transiting at a velocity of 1 m/s through a beam of
150 mm diameter results in a fluence of several mJ/cm2, i.e. not dis-
similar to the range of fluence mentioned above.

PLEDs have been used for phosphor thermometry on surfaces e.g.
Refs. [180(cid:1)182]. In fluids (silicon oil) a 3.2 W 385 nm UV LED was
used to excite the phosphor Mg4FGeO6:Mn4þ by Kim et al. [171], but
the illumination had a duration of 50 ms and was volumetric. Thus
the temporal resolution was very limited and the spatial resolution
only afforded by studying a confined flow limited by a 2 mm chan-
nel. Besides the low peak power of a pulsed LED, creating a thin light
sheet to attain spatial resolution in the depth direction for imaging
is an issue, a problem also encountered using white light LED sour-
ces for TLC illumination. Forming a thin ( <1 mm) light sheet (or
point) is easily done with laser sources, even for DPSS lasers with an
M2 of »30.

PIt has been determined that for some phosphors, for example
ZnO, the intensity ratio between the emission intensities in the two
spectral bands of interest is also a function of laser fluence [14].
Then, stability of the laser beam profile and pulse-to-pulse energy
output may be important. In our experience the output of flash-
lamp-pumped Nd:YAG lasers were suitably stable (within 2(cid:1)4%) in
this regard. These lasers have a near-Gaussian beam profile. Because
of a possible fluence dependence, it is favourable to reduce the spa-
tial variation in laser fluence. This can be done either with a beam
homogeniser [183], for example as used for flow thermometry using
BAM:Eu2þ particles in a wind tunnel [20], or just by expanding the
light sheet far more than the vertical height of the field of view, for
example for imaging ZnO particles [14], and also reducing the beam
waist variation along the direction of propagation by collimation.

PExcitation spectra of many phosphors can be found in the litera-
ture (e.g. Ref. [158]) or provided by the manufacturer and serve as
useful guides for the choice of laser wavelength. It should be noted
however that such data are nearly always obtained using a continu-
ous light source in the mW range. The power density of pulsed lasers
easily reach the MW/cm2 range and for these high irradiances, satu-
ration of the luminescence transitions was observed in both BAM:
Eu2þ and ZnO. Thus the low power density excitation spectra may
not be particularly relevant. The investigation of alternative excita-
tion schemes (different wavelength, longer pulse duration) is still
ongoing, with some examples given in Section 4.4.4. There may be
exciting prospects to increase the luminescence signal, most espe-
cially at high temperatures where thermal quenching is a problem.

P3.2.3. Detectors

PPhoto-multiplier tubes (PMTs) can be used to resolve the lumi-
nescence decay for point lifetime measurements in flows e.g.
[24,26,27,31,39]. In another approach, two filtered (see below) PMTs
were used for ratio-based point measurements for the aforemen-
tioned LDV thermometer setup using BAM:Eu2þ [21].

PFor low-repetition rate imaging measurements, e.g. 1(cid:1)10 Hz, the
interline transfer charge coupled device cameras (CCD cameras) typ-
ically used for PIV are suitable for the detection of the luminescence
signal from phosphor particles. Most phosphors emit in the visible
range of the optical spectrum, where the quantum efficiency of typi-
cal non-intensified CCD cameras is high (» 50%). This is a particularly
favourable feature of
thermographic phosphors. With regard
to the measurement integration time, using the example of a PCO
Sensicam QE CCD camera (12 bit,
thermoelectrically-cooled,
1376 £ 1040 pixels), a camera also sold as LaVision Imager Intense,
the minimum exposure time is 500 ns. For temperature imaging
using the phosphors BAM:Eu2þ (lifetime 1 ms at room temperature)
and ZnO (lifetime < 1 ns at room temperature), we use an exposure
time of 5 ms and start the exposure before the laser pulse. This way
the measured intensity ratio is unaffected by the jitter between the
trigger pulse and start of exposure (for the PCO Sensicam QE CCD

Pcameras mentioned here, by experiment, the jitter was determined
to be about 40 ns [44]).

PAn attractive feature of the CCD camera is that the pixels can be
hardware binned, which consists of converting the charge of a larger
“superpixel” instead of that of every individual pixel, therefore
increasing the ratio of signal to readout noise. This is a very useful
feature at low light levels. If the aim is correlated temperature and
velocity measurements, in principle the spacing between indepen-
dent measurements of each quantity (temperature/velocity) should
be the same. PIV yields a vector spacing in the image plane on the
order of the size of an interrogation area (e.g. 16 £ 16), much larger
than the single pixel resolution so one is nearly always able to afford
4 £ 4 hardware binning on the luminescence detection camera,
plus some additional smoothing.

PIn interline transfer cameras, the accumulated charges are shifted
at the end of the exposure to the interline pixel rows, where they are
stored while the long sequential readout process (typically in the
range of 1(cid:1)100 ms) takes place. However, illumination of the chip
during the readout process can result in an additional accumulation
of charge in the storage pixels, determined by the number of inci-
dent photons during the readout time and the extinction ratio (for
example, 1:2000 for the PCO Sensicam QE CCD camera). As a result,
in the presence of a continuous light source, the effective exposure
time can be an order of magnitude longer than the electronically-
controlled exposure of the active pixels. In addition, this contribu-
tion is non-uniform even for uniform illumination, since the accu-
mulated charge is proportional to the position of the pixels in the
readout sequence. In flows with any significant continuous back-
ground spectrally overlapping the luminescence emission, e.g. flame
luminosity, this effect leads to an unacceptably high background, in
which case intensified cameras must be used for their superior gat-
ing. Also, if a phosphor with a lifetime on the order of 1 ms is used,
the very precise timing (ns) of intensifiers can also be used to dis-
criminate against fast fluorescence signals from e.g. fuel molecules
or walls.

PWhen a very short exposure (ns) or delay with respect to the
laser pulse are not needed, or there is no need to image signals
below 350 nm (where the borosilicate windows and microlens
arrays in ordinary CCD or CMOS cameras normally prevents their
use), nonintensified cameras offer improved imaging characteristics,
in term of dynamic range, linearity, signal to noise ratio, and spatial
resolution. Indeed, Neal et al. reported an imaging resolution equiva-
lent to 12 unbinned camera pixels and a non linearity worse than 6%
below 2000 counts for a Pi-Max 3 (Princeton Instruments) with a
P46 screen [47]. “Scientific” (sCMOS) cameras based on complemen-
tary metal-oxide semiconductor sensors could also be used, but they
remain to be fully tested for quantitative imaging.

PHigh-speed temperature imaging

PFor temperature imaging at high repetition rates, non-intensified
high-speed CMOS cameras were used [19,20]. The latest high speed
CMOS camera models are capable of frame rates as high as 20,000
frames per second at a resolution of 1 megapixel, e.g. Fastcam SA-Z,
Photron or the Phantom v-series, Vision Research. Large on-board
memories (up to 64 GB) allow more than 40,000 frames to be
recorded at full resolution, which translates into approximately 4
orders of magnitude in terms of time scale. CMOS cameras have a
very useful feature: the cameras are continuously capturing images,
but the memory is constantly rewriten on a first frame in first frame
out basis. By feeding a single trigger pulse to the camera, the re-writ-
ing process can be stopped, so that the thousands of frames recorded
before the trigger pulse are saved, which can then be downloaded
from the camera for evaluation. Coupled with continuously running
DPSS lasers this functionality proves essential when one is con-
cerned with investigating the cause of a rare phenomenon, e.g. flash-
back in a combustor, since the recording captures the evolution of

Pthe velocity and temperature field leading up to that event. The
main limitation on the repetition rate when using DPSS lasers is the
pulse energy which dramatically decreases with repetition rate.
However the record length is only limited by the onboard camera
memory since DPSS lasers operate continuously (unlike pulse-burst
systems).

PWhen performing temperature-velocity measurements, another
sampling rate limiting factor is the high-speed CMOS used for PIV,
which must be operated at high resolution for accurate evaluation of
the displacement field and at twice the sampling rate of the ther-
mometry, to obtain an image pair per sample.

PAt high repetition rates, the fact that the luminescence emission
can be detected by non-intensified cameras is an even more impor-
tant advantage of this fluid thermometry approach. Charge depletion
effects arise from the incomplete recharging of the multi-channel
plate between frames in high-speed intensifiers. These make a quan-
titative evaluation of light intensity very difficult, in particular in
transient flows where the signal changes a lot, as the responsivity of
the sensor depends on the irradiance during the preceding frames,
an effect that may even be localised. In Ref. [184], the responsivity
and noise characteristics of intensified and non-intensified high-
speed CMOS cameras are investigated. This study and other high-
speed scalar imaging investigations e.g. Refs. [19,84] have evaluated
the characteristics of high-speed CMOS cameras alone, typically
finding the performance (linearity and variable pixel-to-pixel
response) to be suitable for measurements, see also reviews (Refs.
[8,65]), and the discussion of linearity/offset stability in Section 5.
However for high-speed intensifiers, severe non-linearities of up to
35% depending on the gain and specific intensifier unit and up to 5%
pixel-to-pixel variation in the linearity of the whole system were
reported [184]. Further investigations of these devices are reported
in Ref. [85], which emphasise that a detailed study of the specific
intensifier unit for the implemented framing rate, exposure time
and irradiance levels is mandatory to establish the range over which
the unit can be used accurately, derive corrective functions, and
thereby extract any quantitative measurements.

P3.2.4. Filters

PFor lifetime measurements, the spectral band of interest simply
needs to be isolated or certain spectral regions blocked, for example
around the excitation laser line. However when the temperature
dependence of the emission spectrum is exploited for intensity ratio
measurements, e.g. for temperature imaging by using two cameras
with distinct interference filters, the filter choice is critical. The
knowledge of the luminescence emission spectra at different tem-
peratures is a pre-requisite to design a two-colour experiment, and
is most often obtained from a stack of phosphor powder placed in an
optically accessible furnace (see Section 4.3). For a given set of filters,
the intensity ratio ’ at various temperatures can be estimated by
digital integration, as in:
R 1
0 Eðλ; TÞtBðλÞdλ
R 1
0 Eðλ; TÞtAðλÞdλ

’ðTÞ 1⁄4

ð2Þ

where E(λ, T) is the spectral flux at the input of the spectrometer and
tA and tB the spectral transmission functions of the two channels,
which also includes the transmission function of the lens and quan-
tum efficiency of the sensor. The temperature sensitivity c (in %/K),
the normalised change in the intensity ratio with temperature) is
then defined as:

cðTÞ 1⁄4 1

PA simple estimation of the average temperature sensitivity c

PThe two primary functions of the filter combination are 1) to
minimise the random temperature uncertainty over the tempera-
ture range of interest and for a given level of luminescence intensity
and 2) limit interference signals from any other sources of light (Mie
scattering, flame luminosity, thermal radiation from surfaces) while
transmitting as much signal as possible. At a given temperature the
random uncertainty in the measured temperature is:

where IA and IB are the estimated recorded intensity in channel A and

B respectively, and sIA
=IA is the inverse of the signal to noise ratio in chan-
other words sIA
nel A. One can infer from Eq. 4 that it is generally the inverse of the
product of the temperature sensitivity c and the signal to noise ratio
in the weakest channel which determines the temperature precision,
so this product must be maximised to minimise the uncertainty.

PPredicting signal to noise ratio for a given measurement configu-
ration is not always straightforward, requiring the knowledge of the
emission intensity either per particle or for a specific particle concen-
tration, for a given excitation fluence and temperature, as well as the
noise characteristics and sensitivity of the sensors. The luminescence
intensities of the phosphors BAM:Eu2þ and ZnO have been quantified
in the studies described in Section 4.4. In Ref. [13], we describe a
model for the prediction of the measurement uncertainty based on
these data. Lee et al. mention the use of a similar model to optimise
the filter combination for BAM:Eu2þ [16]. Using our model and particle
signal levels measured in a completely independent study, we came to
the same conclusions. Basically, it is critical to perform the analysis for
realistic signal levels in the fluid, otherwise it is possible that a highly
sensitive but low throughput set of filters will be chosen. Both total
transmission and sensitivity must be balanced, and it is important to
optimise the filters for the particular temperature range of the experi-
ment. In other words, for a given phosphor, one set of filters might be
better at low temperature, another at high temperature. More sensi-
tive filters are favoured when there is a significant fixed error contri-
bution to the intensity ratio precision (see Section 5.1).

PFor phosphors where the temperature dependence comes from
two distinct energy levels, the gating of the two exposures can be
used to tune the temperature sensitivity, as the lifetime of two lines
or group of lines have different lifetime versus temperature charac-
teristics. Ref. [47]. used an “optimised” camera timing with the YAG:
Pr3þ phosphor which improves the temperature sensitivity of the
intensity ratio from 0.46 to 0.87 %/K in the range 600(cid:1)800 K (this

Pestimation is based on digitised curves from Ref. [47]). Again, the
effect on the level of the recorded luminescence signals should be
quantified, and taken into account when assessing the performance
of a specific timing scheme.

PAs a guideline, it is preferable to have the intensity ratio close to
unity in the middle of the temperature range of interest as large dif-
ference in signal between the two channels are challenging due to
the dynamic range and linearity of the sensor. The rejection of scat-
tered laser light is also essential, as this process is much stronger
than the luminescence and we recommend optical densities of 4 or
more at the laser wavelength. For some of the setups described in
the next section, the use of a suitable dichroic beamsplitter in place
of a spectrally flat 50/50 beamsplitter can double the signal level in
each channel.

P3.2.5. Two-colour imaging setups

PTo derive the two dimensional temperature field from phosphor
particles with a temperature dependent emission spectrum, it is
necessary to form two images of the same particle field, each filtered
in a specific spectral region, on two distinct sets of pixels. The main
point is that these must be spatially matched prior to division. This
can be aided by software but from an optical point of view some set-
ups are advantageous. The following applies only to two-colour
intensity ratio imaging methods because generally, for the lifetime
imaging approach using high-speed CMOS cameras, single images
are formed on a single detector.

PIn the simplest setup, two cameras with two different interfer-
ence filters are positioned next to each other and both are slightly
angled so as to form two different views of the same object, as
shown in Fig. 14 a). This was used for temperature measurements in
a heated jet using the phosphor YAG:Dy3þ [178]. In such case, a
Scheimpflug adapter on at least one of the cameras is necessary to
tilt the object focal plane of the camera so that it lies in the measure-
ment plane defined by the laser sheet, so that the whole measure-
ment plane is imaged in focus. Because two different viewing angles
of the particle fields are used, a relative perspective error still exists
between the two images. Particles appear in different locations
depending on their depth position in the light sheet as depicted on
Fig. 15. This displacement error is a function of the distance between
the camera and the object. The depth-dependent position is the opti-
cal principle behind stereoscopic PIV. In a intensity ratio imaging
approach, it is necessary to compare spectrally filtered signals from
the same particle or group of particles. Therefore this relative dis-
placement of the particle intensity field is probematic and must be

Ptransmission spectrum across the field of view, requiring corrective
procedures described in Section 3.3).

PDifferent systems have been used to form two spectrally distinct
images of the same object on the same camera. This has the obvious
benefit that it saves one image sensor. The stereoscope (“image dou-
bler” as it is often referred to) shown in Fig. 14d) is an assembly of
two apertures, two adjustable mirrors and a prism that are all
mounted in front of the camera objective. A stereoscope was used in
Refs. [29,31(cid:1)33,35,39,42,43]. With this system, two views of the
same object are projected on the two halves of the image sensor.
Interference filters are placed over each aperture. The image doubler
suffers from the same perspective error issue as the stereoscopic
arrangment. The key problem with these systems are that the spatial
extent of the image formed by the lens through one aperture is not
limited to half of the sensor. Then an object peripheral to the field of
view can be imaged via one aperture onto the wrong side of the
chip, in addition to the object of interest imaged through the other
aperture. This is a severe problem if light is emitted adjacent to the
field of view, which may very often be the case in practical situa-
tions. To prevent this so-called cross-talk, the aperture can be
reduced, which decreases the transmission of this secondary image
due to vignetting. Based on the transmission curve provided in the
literature for a commerically available stereoscope sold by LaVision
GmbH, a f-stop as high as 5.6 is necessary to reduce the transmit-
tance of the secondary image to below 10% of the primary image
over 75% of the field of view. We confirmed these values experimen-
tally. This results in a factor 16 reduction in the throughput as
opposed to a two camera system with f/1.4 objectives. A good way
to deal with cross-talk is to use the laser sheet to define the spatial
extent of the region where light is emitted in the axis in which the
image is doubled. For example, if the laser propagates horizontally
and if the image doubler is mounted vertically, the height of the laser
sheet can be adjusted so that it just matches the size of the primary
field of view defined by the projection of half the sensor, removing
any light source which could form secondary objects. This solution
was adopted for 3D mixture fraction imaging using acetone LIF
[187].

PThe Optosplit from Cairn Research is another system for single
sensor/two-colour imaging which was developed for fluorescence
microscopy. As shown in Fig. 14 e), a first lens is used to form an
image onto a rectangular aperture, which defines the spatial extent
of the object, preventing cross talk. The light is then collimated by
an additional lens, split by a beamsplitter, and redirected by a set of
mirrors through a lens to form two duplicate images side by side on
a single sensor. The mirror arrangment is designed to compensate
any path length difference so that relative perspective distortion
between the two images is avoided. However, this particular system
is designed for microscopy, so the small size of the optical elements
result in a dramatic drop in light throughput for the demagnification
typically used for the field of view of most fluid flow experiments. A
custom system following a similar approach to the Optosplit was
used with success by Yokomori et al. in a heated jet of air [53].

P3.2.6. Integration with velocimetry

PA major advantage of thermometry techniques based on phos-
phor particles is that much sought-after simultaneous velocity
measurements are possible, usually using Mie scattering from the
phosphor particles. First, we address a question we are often asked:
“why not use the luminescence particle images for PIV?”. As dis-
cussed previously for the high-speed camera approach of Someya
et al. [52], the lifetime-based temperature diagnostic may be influ-
enced by the motion of the particles, which has the disadvantage
that it effectively limits the range of flow conditions, and therefore
applications. A similar principle (using the long luminescence decay
of some phosphors following a single laser pulse to record time-sep-
arated images of the particles) was also exploited in Ref. [53].

Fig. 15. Perspective error using a stereo arrangment. The two particles marked by the
black dots are physically located in the same x position, but the particle at the back of
the light sheet in a different z position appears in a different x location in the image
plane, and will not be corrected properly using a mapping procedure applied in the
centre of the light sheet.

Pcorrected for, normally using software mapping, which is discussed
in Section 3.3. However, due to the stereoscopic effect, different cor-
rections should be applied to different planes within the light sheet.
A correction simply based on the mid-plane results in a residual dis-
placement d in the measurement plane between two images of the
same particle depending on the position in the light sheet:

d 1⁄4 tan

(cid:3) (cid:4)
u
2

z

ð5Þ

where u is the angle between the optical axes of the two imaging
systems, and z the position of the particle relative to the mapped
plane as illustrated in Fig 15. Using such a setup, we have found that,
for a light sheet 700 mm thick and a field of view 43 £ 36 mm, a
stereo angle of just 9° reduces the intensity ratio precision by a fac-
tor 5 compared to the beamsplitter arrangement described below,
because the particle fields do not match. Increasing the angle to 60°
made the measured ratio field so noisy as to be unworkable.

POne way to avoid this perspective error is to place the two cam-
eras on opposite sides of the measurement plane, as shown in
Fig. 14 b, so that the optical axis of the two imaging systems are
colinear. This system was previously used for particle imaging in the
gas phase [37,45]. Such arrangements require optical access from
both sides. In addition, the luminescence light emitted by the par-
ticles can be reflected by the interference filters and collected by
each opposing camera. This degrades the spatial resolution of the
technique. Furthermore, as in the stereoscopic arrangment described
above, the optical paths of the two imaging systems are separate so
that any difference on the optical paths, for example from dust, par-
ticles or droplets deposited on windows, or beam steering effects
due to a non-uniform temperature field, may cause problematic
intensity differences between the two images.

PA more robust approach is to use a beamsplitter and two cameras
positioned at 90° as shown in Fig. 14 c). Spectral separation can be
achieved either by interference filters in front of the respective cam-
era objectives and/or using a dichroic i.e. spectrally selective beams-
plitter. In this configuration, if the relative position of the two
cameras is adjusted, the optical path between the object and beams-
plitter can be made nearly identical for both imaging systems, so
that spectrally flat attenuation caused by, for example fouled win-
dows, has the same effect on both images, and thus in principle
divides out in the division. The matching of the optical paths, single-
sided optical access, and robustness to interference are good reasons
why this is a very popular approach to intensity ratio imaging
and has been used for flow thermometry in many studies
[14(cid:1)16,19,20,44,46,47,172,185,186]. Note the angular dependence
of the dichroic may lead to strong variations in reflection and

Pbe positioned at an angle to minimise interference with the lumines-
cence detection system [16,51].

PIf neither is possible, an additional beamsplitter can be used,
which in combination with a two-camera plus beamsplitter arrange-
ment means that the three cameras are imaging the particles from
the same side and on the same axis. Off-the-shelf long pass dichroic
mirrors can be used, i.e. with the Mie scattering camera in transmis-
sion, but the problem is that the particle luminescence is imaged
onto one camera via two reflections. In our experience, this led to an
unacceptable level of optical abberations, due to waveform distor-
tion at the beamsplitters. Using 532 nm shortpass dichroic mirror
would avoid that any of the luminescence images are acquired via
two reflections, but for the phosphors BAM:Eu2þ or ZnO, for exam-
ple, which emit in the near visible-blue spectral range, such optics
proved hard to find. Since the Mie scattered light is often a lot more
intense than the luminescence light, a spectrally flat low reflectivity
plate or pellicle beamsplitter can be used as the first beamsplitter,
which reflects the Mie scattering and transmits most of the lumines-
cence. This approach was employed in Ref. [47] for simultaneous
temperature and velocity imaging in gas flows using YAG:Pr3þ.

3.3. Image acquisition and processing

PThe flow diagram in Fig. 17 presents the processing steps to gen-
erate a temperature field using the spectrally resolved method
(intensity ratio). Some operations are corrections to account for
interfering signals (offset and background subtractions), alignment
of the detector(s) (image mapping) or for the response of the phos-
phor (fluence correction, temperature conversion). Some steps are
also taken to reduce statistical measurement uncertainty (cutoff fil-
ter, spatial filter) at the expense of the measurement resolution.

PThe reasons for the focus on the two-colour intensity ratio
approach are its popularity for flow temperature imaging and the
peculiarities of particle-based two-colour scalar imaging, which are
quite unique since they require the very accurate overlap of particle
images. Curve fitting algorithms for the lifetime for point and 2D
methods are extensively described in the literature for surface

laser, and a two-colour single camera dual-frame system (the detection system used

PInstead, for thermometry a two-colour ratio imaging approach was
used, as shown in Fig. 16. If properly optimised, this can eliminate
any adverse effect of the particles moving on the temperature mea-
surement. Another approach is to use two excitation laser pulses
with a short time delay, for example with a dual cavity 355 nm laser,
and record two subsequent luminescence images of the particles for
PIV, as was recently done in Ref. [185].

PThese methods are tempting because they remove the PIV system
altogether. However, for thermometry often the luminescence imag-
ing cameras are hardware-binned to reduce noise levels, and lenses
are set to maximum aperture (f/1.4 or higher) to maximise the signal
level. This directly conflicts with the ordinarily high pixel resolution
and a stepped down aperture necessary to optimise the particle
images for PIV algorithms. Therefore these approaches require fur-
ther consideration of the loss in PIV measurement quality in relation
to depth of field and pixel locking effects; and drop in signal-to-noise
ratio in the thermometry if the camera hardware binning is reduced.
A careful analysis is called for.

PIn general, to achieve the best possible temperature measure-
ments, it is usually preferable to decouple the thermometry and
velocimetry systems by detecting the particle Mie scattering with a
separate detector(s), and using additional lasers as necessary. For
example, for additional velocity measurements using LDV a conven-
tial argon-ion laser and PMT may be used, or for PIV, add the usual
double-pulse PIV laser at 532 nm and camera. Another option for PIV
is to frequency triple (or quadruple) the output of the PIV laser, so as
to use only one laser for both luminescence excitation, and velocim-
etry using the Mie scattering at 355 nm, as in [17]. Also, the residual
green output from a single cavity frequency tripled (or quadrupled)
laser can also be extracted and combined with an additional second
single pulse laser at 532 nm as in [44].

PThe experimental setup for integrated LDV and point thermome-
try is relatively straightforward [21,22]. For the simultaneous appli-
cation of PIV using particle Mie scattering (or for particle counting as
described in Section 4), the extra camera required may be positioned
in various ways. It can be on the same side of the measurement
plane as the luminescence imaging cameras, and fitted with a
Scheimpflug adapter as in [20,44]. However, there is then a perspec-
tive error inherent to single camera PIV originating from out of plane
motion, which increases with the angle between the camera axis and
the normal to the measurement plane. If the test rig allows two
sided optical access, another solution is to place the camera on the
opposite side of the measurement plane. A coloured glass filter can

Pphosphor thermometry (see reviews [10(cid:1)12]) and other fields, and
are not explained here. Therefore some of the steps mentioned in
the following are specific only to the two-colour imaging method,
but the background correction, nonlinearity correction, spatial filter-
ing and fluence correction are all also relevant to lifetime-based
approaches.

P3.3.1. Background subtraction

PThe term background designates any signal that does not origi-
nate from the spectrally filtered luminescence collected from the
particles in the elementary probe volume, and so it must be sub-
tracted. Luminescence from particles deposited on the surfaces,
either directly imaged or reflected by other surfaces, surface flare,
and flame radiation are example of background sources. The number
of counts in the raw image can be described by:
G 1⁄4 Glum
where the first term is the desired light contribution from the phos-
phor tracer particles in the probe volume, the second term the light
contribution from other light sources, including those induced by
the laser pulse, e.g. surface scattering, signal from particles attached
to walls and laser induced fluorescence (window, fuels), and the last
term for the camera offset.

þ Gbg

þ Gdc

ð6Þ

PNote that often the offset and background light originating from
þ Gdc as an average
stable sources can be subtracted together Gbg
image without particle seeding. However there are reasons why
these contributions may be separated in the analysis : 1) that the
camera offset (and the background, see below) may be unstable and
require specific consideration; and 2) that for accurate linearity cor-
rection, the offset-subtracted background signal Gbg must be evalu-
ated separately.

PThe uncertainty in the background evaluation increases with the
intensity of the background signal, so that it is essential to minimise
it, via removing, cleaning or blacking out reflective surfaces, and
choosing filter combination that minimises interferences from other
light sources such as flame luminescence or stray light. Also often,
the background varies in time, so it cannot be accurately evaluated.
Uncertainties originating from interfering background signals are
discussed in detail in Section 5.4.

P3.3.2. Image mapping

PAccurate mapping between the object and image space is impor-
tant for any imaging technique to correlate the measured tempera-
ture/velocity to the spatial location (x,y). Here, in addition, because
it is necessary to divide two highly structured luminescence particle
images we must minimise any relative displacement between the
two images, otherwise sharp gradients in the intensity field would
lead to extreme values after division.

PThe traditional approach to two-colour imaging consists of
roughly adjusting the two sensors in space so as to achieve the best
spatial overlap between the two images which maximises the useful
part of the active sensor area. There may still be a displacement of
several pixels between the two images of the same object resulting
from translation, rotation and scaling, which is then corrected by
software mapping as in various flow thermometry studies using
phosphor particles [16,19,37].

PFor the beamsplitter setup described in Section 3.2.5 (Fig. 14),
fine mechanical alignment of the two sensors can be used to further
maximise the sensor useful area, and to guarantee the best overlap
between the optical paths of the two image systems. By placing the
reflection camera on two translation stages, and the beamsplitter on
a mount with two rotation axis, relative distortion between the two
images can be minimised. It is actually then possible to run a PIV
algorithm with a coarse vector spacing (e.g. the interactive PIV mode
of the DaVis program from LaVision GmbH), to continuously display
the displacement field the during adjustment of the sensor, which

two-camera plus beamsplitter system. The axes designate the binned pixel number.
The mean absolute displacement is 0.18 binned pixels.

Pprovides very useful feedback to the user setting up the experiment.
To derive the displacement field, either a target with evenly spaced
lines, or the particles themselves can be used. With such approach,
for a PCO sensicam QE CCD sensor with 4 £ 4 hardware pixel bin-
ning, and a magnification of 0.3, mean values of the residual dis-
placement field in the range 0.15(cid:1)0.25 pixels can be achieved, as
shown on Fig. 18. The residual displacement is likely due to a relative
distortion caused by the beamsplitter. In such cases, no software
mapping was performed before division of the particle images, and
only a simple scaling of image was applied on the temperature field
[14,44].

PIn cases which larger displacement, or to further improve the
mapping between the images, a target consisting of equally spaced
dots or crosses can be imaged and a calibration procedure used. The
idea behind software mapping is to identify the distortion between
an object and its image in order to apply the inverse distortion to the
recorded particle images. To map two cameras with each other, both
images are mapped to the same physical coordinates. A detailed
description of the process can be found in Ref. [188]. In this proce-
dure, the accurate positioning of the calibration target in the mea-
surement plane is necessary,
in particular for off-axis imaging
system (stereoscopic cameras and image doubler).

PSince luminescence images are highly structured, a PIV-like
cross-correlation between the particle fields in both channels can
also be used to derive the relative displacement field between the
two sensors. In post-processing, one of the two images can then be
deformed by the displacement field, which consist of an 2D interpo-
lation of its intensity field for each sub-regions used in the vector
calculation. This approach can be viewed as a simple planar version
of the self-calibration method for stereo PIV which corrects the map-
ping functions of the two cameras in case of a misalignment of the
3-D calibration target and the thin laser sheet, using disparity maps
extracted from particle image cross-correlation [189]. Particle image
based approaches are also employed in Refs. [45,53].

PIt is unclear at this stage whether accurate manual alignment, or
a deformation of the images in post processing after rough align-
ment offers the lowest uncertainty. Certainly, in general it is likely
that using image mapping is a more versatile approach. In any case,
this is always possible following manual alignment, where the man-
ual procedure still serves to maximise the overlap between the two
detection paths, as well as the use of the sensor active areas.

PFor measurements with CCD cameras that are hardware binned,
it is possible to improve the accuracy of the mapping based on
images of particles or target at full sensor resolution, as shown on
Fig. 19. At high measurement resolution (e.g. 200 mm), the measure-
ment precision is significantly improved (15% to 9%) when using a
mapping function derived at full resolution. Here the measurement
resolution was adjusted by the size of the moving average filter (see
following section) and was measured as the 10(cid:1)90% distance of the

P3.3.4. Corrections

PAfter the cutoff and spatial filter, the two resulting images can be
divided. To determine whether further corrections are needed, the
intensity ratio is expressed as a function of various experimental
variables:

Þ

’ 1⁄4 ’ x; y; T; F
ð7Þ
ð
where x and y are the location in the object plane, T the fluid temper-
ature and F the local fluence. The dependence on the spatial coordi-
nate x and y originates from non uniformities in the collection
efficiency and from the angular dependence of the spectral transmis-
sion function of the filters and beamsplitter.

PA dependence of the intensity ratio on the laser fluence has been
observed for BAM:Eu2þ [13,16] and ZnO [14] to various extents, the
origin of which will be discussed in Section 4.4.4. Assuming that the
dependencies can be separated [14]:

after image mapping based on full resolution target images or on 4x4 hardware
binned target images.

Pedge spread function from a equally processed image of a calibration
target. In reality the improvement is even larger, because the spatial
resolution is degraded when dividing two images with a relative
displacement. At lower spatial resolution ( > 300 mm), the measure-
ment precision is less sensitive to small residual displacement, and
so the benefit of this approach becomes negligible.

P3.3.3. Filtering

PAfter the background subtraction, and possibly the image
mapping, an intensity cut-off filter is generally applied. The role
of this filter is to exclude areas of low signal where very few
particles are present from further processing. Temperature infor-
mation will not be provided for these pixels. This is in order to
only provide temperature information which has a sufficient
degree of confidence in terms of statistical uncertainty. This
allows further discrimination when performing subsequent spa-
tial or time averaging to define confidence. For example, if at a
given pixel position the averaging area contains an unsufficient
number of non-zero pixels for statistical confidence, it should
also be discarded from further processing. In Ref. [16], a filter
conditioned on a Mie scattering image of the particles was also
used. Via cross-correlation, the Mie scattering image and the
luminescence image were matched, and from the Mie scattering,
regions where too few particles are present were identified and
removed from the luminescence images.

PAn additional filter should also be used to remove saturated pix-
els, which obviously have a non-linear response. For non-intensified
cameras, the threshold must be the maximum pixel intensity. For
intensified cameras, saturation effects may already be observed
below the full well capacity of the camera, requiring a lower filter
level [190].

PUsually a moving average, moving median filter, or simply bin-
ning is then used to increase the signal to noise ratio at the expense
of spatial resolution, as shown in Fig. 19. Note that in Ref. [16], these
filtering operations were performed after division of the background
subtracted images. Addition and division not commuting, the opera-
tion order may affect the numerical values, so the same order should
be also used for generating correction and calibration data.

PThe final resolution of the measurement is then established using
equally smoothed images of a resolution target, e.g. a knife edge, a
Siemens star or a 1951 USAF target. Unfortunately, this information
is missing in many published works on fluid thermometry using
phosphor particles.

PThe first term describes the“white field” correction (also some-
times referred to as flat field), assuming this is independent of tem-
perature. The second term describes the dependence of the intensity
ratio on temperature, and the third the dependence of the intensity
ratio on the overall spatial distribution of the fluence field. The sepa-
ration of these last two terms assumes that the relative change of
the intensity ratio with temperature is independent of the laser flu-
ence. These assumptions have been explored and are summarised in
Section 5.6.

PNon-uniformities in the collection efficiency described by the
first term can be caused by for example mechanical vignetting. Such
effect is pronounced for two-colour single-camera systems, e.g.
using an image doubler (see Fig. 14). In addition, the spectral trans-
mission profiles of interference filters are sensitive to incidence
angles. The profile as specified by the supplier is only valid for colli-
mated light with a given incidence angle, so in general, for imaging,
it is broadened towards the UV even for a point directly on the opti-
cal axis because uncollimated light is imaged through the filter.
More importantly, the incidence angle of rays originating from a par-
ticle in the field of view varies with its spatial location, so the effec-
tive spectral transmission profile is position-dependent, with a
strong effect on the intensity ratio, in particular for the beamsplitter,
and requires correction.

PTo correct for both effects, a phosphor pellet can be placed
behind a diffusive screen as to mimic the spectral content and the
Lambertian light emission characteristics of the phosphor and
imaged on both channels as was described in Ref. [44]. Particle
images can then be divided by this intensity ratio field for white field
correction.

PExamples of white field images obtained with the phosphor BAM:
Eu2þ using an image doubler and a beamsplitter arrangement are
shown in Fig. 20 (note the different scaling). For the image doubler,
the white field image is strongly dominated by mechanical vignett-
ing causing a very pronounced gradient from left to right. For the
beamsplitter arrangment, the variations are far smaller. The left-to-
right gradient, and the circular pattern are believed to be caused by
the angular dependence of the beamsplitter and interference filters
respectively. In Ref. [37], defocused images of a white paper were
recorded, which should in theory produce a uniform illumination on
each sensor, allowing to account for non-uniformity in pixel sensi-
tivity. However since the spatial information is lost by defocusing,
vignetting and angular dependence cannot be fully corrected this
way.

PUsing the luminescence from seeded particles and the exact same
optics (including windows) is the best approach to the white-field
correction when a suitable uniform temperature condition can be
generated in a straightforward fashion [19,45]. The intensity ratio
image obtained from the uniform field at a reference temperature

PFor these two reasons, the absolute value of the measured quan-
tity and its variation with temperature may differ between the cali-
bration and the actual experimental environment and setup. It is
also important to note that because of the variability inherent to
some of the phosphor manufacturing processes discussed in Sec-
tion 2.3, every batch of phosphor should be experimentally charac-
terised to avoid calibration problems.

PMore generally, in light of these considerations, an in-situ cali-
bration performed with the same optical setup as for the actual
measurements is preferred when possible, to minimise the tempera-
ture uncertainty. One approach used by Lawrence et al. used a
300 mm diameter thermocouple coated with a 30 mm layer of phos-
phor, which they inserted into a heated jet and a flame and imaged
to extract an intensity ratio which was associated to the thermocou-
ple reading [35]. While such system is relatively simple and avoids
uncertainty linked to the transfer function of the optical compo-
nents, differences may still arise from the fact that the coating is still
and as a result repeatedly illuminated and exposed for a relatively
long time to high temperature and to possible self-absorption
effects.

PInstead, a typical way to calibrate the optical system/phosphor
combination in-situ is to add the particles to a temperature con-
trolled liquid, or seed the phosphor particles into a gas jet while
adjusting the jet exit temperature. For temperatures in the range
300 to 800 K, an in-line electrical heater is typically used. For meas-
urements at higher temperatures, a tube can be placed inside a high
temperature furnace, and measurements performed at the exit of
the tube as described in Ref. [13]. To avoid thermal expansion dis-
placing the tube exit, a fused silica tube can be used. For tempera-
tures below room temperature, a similar tube can be placed inside a
liquid nitrogen flask. Under controlled conditions, the jet forms an
extended isothermal region with a steady temperature which can be
measured by a thermocouple probe, as discussed in Section 6.2.
Sources of uncertainty in the reference temperature are discussed in
Section 5.7, and depend on the temperature range, probe geometry,
and immersion depth in the fluid.

PA suitable fit is then found for the measured datapoints, and used
to convert the images into temperature. A second order polynomial
was found to well describe the intensity ratio response of BAM:Eu2þ
[44] while a power law was found to be more suitable for ZnO [14].
A description of the uncertainty associated with the calibration and
temperature conversion process is given in Section 5.7.

PAs an outlook, measuring luminescence spectra from particles
dispersed in the fluid over the temperature range of interest offers
interesting perspectives. First it would improve optimisation of the
filter choice, which is free of the systematic errors linked to the bulk
powder studies. In the particular cases where the transmission func-
tions of the optics are accurately known, it would also alleviate the
need for an extra calibration with the imaging system.

4. Characterisation of phosphor particles for flow thermometry

PThe following section presents a summary of the current state of
knowledge about the luminescence properties of phosphor particles
that have been used for flow thermometry. The emphasis is placed
on properties that are particularly relevant to fluid thermometry,
such as the luminescence emission intensity and the sensitivity to the
surrounding environment. There are various phosphor characterisa-
tion methods, which stem from the observation that the information
extracted from studies of bulk powder may not always be relevant to
the case of dispersed particles, prompting the need for in-situ charac-
terisation studies. These methodologies are summarised and the
advantages and limitations of each are discussed. We then review the
findings of the characterisation work so far undertaken for some
phosphors in the context of fluid temperature measurements.

beamsplitter arrangment (right). Note the difference in the colour scale. The axes cor-
respond to vertical and horizontal pixel numbers for a 4x4 hardware binned PCO Sen-
sicam QE camera.

Pfield is then used to correct the measured ratio images under non-
isothermal conditions by division, as in:

PThis makes the normalised ratio a function of temperature only,
meaning it is independent of the fluence distribution and non-uni-
formity in light transmission. In this case, a statistically significant
average image must be compiled to limit the propagation of uncer-
tainty when applying the correction. Often a room temperature flow
is used, which generally has the advantage that it is simple. How-
ever, in some cases such as internal combustion engines, this may
not be straightforward. Neal et al. used images recorded at the start
of the compression stroke where the temperature was assumed to
be homogeneous, and known from a thermodynamic calculation
[47].

PAdditional correction for fluctuations in the pulse-to-pulse varia-
tions in the laser fluence may be necessary. An error analysis derived
from the various assumptions made in these corrections are dis-
cussed in Sections 5.6 and 5.7.

3.4. Temperature calibration

PTo convert the processed data into temperature, the tempera-
ture-dependence of the measured quantity must be established.
For example, to calibrate the intensity ratio, luminescence spec-
tra recorded from a stack of powder or phosphor coating placed
in an optically accessible furnace can be digitally integrated
using Eq. (2) to yield a theoretical temperature response of the
filter combination. However, such a calibration method may be
inaccurate because:

P(cid:3) The spectral transmission functions of the various optical com-
ponents (camera lens, interference filter, sensor) in each channel
may not be accurately known. For cameras and lenses, this is
particularly true in the near-UV spectral range. In addition, spec-
tral characteristics of interference filters are usually provided for
collimated light only and, as discussed above, may not accu-
rately correspond to imaging situations.

P(cid:3) Section 4.3 will show there may be differences between the
luminescence properties of particles recorded in the dispersed-
phase and in powder form, due to phenomena such as heating
under repeated laser illumination, thermal degradation (oxida-
tion), multiple scattering and self-absorption. Several previous
studies of thermographic phosphors have recognised that opti-
cal interactions may lead to uncertainty when results obtained
from densely-packed powders are used to calibrate flow experi-
ments [49,51,178].

4.1. Phosphors used for flow thermometry

PTo the best of our knowledge, Table 1 below lists all the thermo-
graphic phosphors used to date for fluid temperature measurements,
and/or characterised in the fluid phase in the context of fluid ther-
mometry. For each phosphor, the thermometry strategies employed
and applications are provided. Intrinsic physical parameters (particle
size), luminescence properties (luminescence lifetime) and experi-
mental parameters that are closely related to the luminescence char-
acteristics (excitation and detection wavelengths) are also listed.

PIt can be seen that one of the most important parameters, the
luminescence lifetime at room temperature, varies by more than six
orders of magnitude among these different phosphors. Note that
some phosphors have different lifetimes for different emission lines,
and here when two groups of lines are used for the temperature
evaluation, the lifetime of the longest group is given. A range of exci-
tation wavelengths has been used, primarily the UV harmonics of
pulsed Nd:YAG lasers at 355 and 266 nm but also 375 nm (cw diode

for

Plaser [21,22]), a line in the infrared spectral range at 980 nm (using
an OPO/OPA system)
the upconversion phosphor Y2O2S:
Er3þ;Yb3þ; and 337 nm generated using a pulsed N2 laser. The lumi-
nescence emission may be comprised of relatively sharp lines or of a
broader band as in the case of ZnO and BaMgAl10O17:Eu2þ; as was
shown on Fig. 4. The detected spectral range is always visible or
near-visible. Just this small selection of phosphors is indicative of
the previously-mentioned flexibility in excitation and detection
wavelengths. Where specified in the original articles, the particle
size is usually in the 2(cid:1)5 mm range, but both larger (8(cid:1)10 mm) and
much smaller (50 nm) particles have been employed. These phos-
phors were variously used in liquids and gases, with temporal
and spectral methods, and for both point and planar measure-
ments. Note that in the table, spectral ratio and intensity ratio
are used respectively to differentiate between a temperature
measurement derived from a recorded luminescence spectrum,
and one based on spectral selection using optical filters on the
detection channel(s).

4.2. The aims of phosphor particle characterisation

PNaturally the success of a measurement using a given phosphor
depends on the thermometry strategy and execution, calibration
and so forth. As discussed in the previous and the following sections,
these directly determine or influence the temperature range, preci-
sion, temporal and spatial resolution, and temperature accuracy.
However, the similarities and differences summarised in Table 1
serve to indicate that the choice of phosphor itself is critical. The
question is: which phosphor to use in a given application? For exam-
ple, eight different phosphors were used in heated free jets of air
using the intensity ratio method. For a fixed short (» ms) integration
time (camera exposure) the signal levels from phosphors with life-
times ranging from ns-ms must vary widely. These different phos-
phors have different temperature sensitivities. Yet together these
two parameters govern the intrinsic precision of the temperature
measurement, as described by Eq. (4). The chosen particle size also
varies considerably, but this directly affects the flow and tempera-
ture tracing accuracy and also the luminescence signal. Most nota-
bly, among these studies there are reports that appear to be
inconsistent, e.g. for Y3Al5O12:Dy3þ; where some of the cited experi-
ments were in fact deemed unsuccessful under certain conditions
[35,36,38,46].

PThat many different phosphors have been chosen for tempera-
ture measurements in fluids is perhaps to be expected, for very few
studies have provided measurements of the “absolute” lumines-
cence intensity of phosphor particles, especially in the framework of
fluid thermometry. Furthermore, the possibilites to theoretically
predict in a generalised fashion whether a phosphor will offer useful
functionality for flow thermometry are somewhat limited. The lumi-
nescence signal of the material at a given temperature depends on
the absorption coefficient at the excitation wavelength and the
quantum efficiency of the transition(s) detected for thermometry.
Due to the complexity of the luminescence processes in inorganic
solids (see Section 2), these quantities are already difficult to deter-
mine in advance simply from the known composition, dopant con-
impurities etc. For almost all phosphors, the
centration, phase,
absorption coefficient is not available, and the quantum efficiency is
only provided as a relative measure.

PThe spatial extent of the material, in this case nm- to mm-scale
particles, also determines the nature of the laser-particle interaction.
The quantity of light absorbed (and scattered) by a particle is given
by the absorption and scattering cross-sections. These are usually
calculated using Maxwell’s equations, often considering spherical
particles for simplicity, with knowledge of the particle diameter and
optical constants. The cross-sections may also have a complex
dependence on the particle shape, structure, state of agglomeration
and even orientation.

PAlthough the direct measurement of these parameters either for
powders or single particles would be very useful, for our purposes
this is not the main goal of characterisation. Rather, with a pragmatic
focus on improving and broadening the capabilities of the measure-
ment technique, the primary aim is to systematically characterise
the luminescence characteristics of phosphor particles relevant to
flow thermometry. First, quantitative measurements of the lumines-
cence signal of a known quantity of particles are required. This
allows the accurate comparison of different phosphors. Second, the
temperature-dependence of the signal and spectrum and/or lifetime
must be known. Together this information enables the prediction of
signal levels and temperature precision for practical applications.
Third, from the perspective of error analysis it is also important to
analyse possible cross-dependencies of either the measured temper-
ature or luminescence signal on other parameters, such as the fluid
composition, particle seeding density, excitation laser fluence and
irradiance as well as practical considerations such as possible irre-
versible particle damage.

PSpecial attention should be paid to the first requirement. For
characterisation purposes it is crucial to have some measure, for
example the mass of particles or the particle number density, to
know, for a given phosphor and for specified conditions, how many
particles are required for a successful measurement. The lumines-
cence emission intensity varies greatly between different phosphor
materials, and in principle, the luminescence signal is a direct func-
tion of the seeding density. It is then tempting to infer that one may
seed orders of magnitude more particles into a flow to compensate
in situations with low signal levels for example, at high tempera-
tures (low quantum efficiences); where excitation fluence is limited,
or simply where the phosphor is unfavourable for flow thermometry
in the first instance i.e. poor absorption, inefficient or possessing a
long lifetime. However inviting, this approach will not work, not
least because in heavily seeded fluids multiple scattering may unac-
ceptably reduce the accuracy and spatial resolution (see Section 5.5),
and/or in reacting gases alter the volumetric heat capacity and even
directly quench the flame (see Section 5.8). To be clear, the number
of particles does not routinely need to be known for the technique to
function effectively, but it is essential to be mindful of the seeding
level to ensure it is reasonable and does not unduly compromise the
accuracy, resolution or non-intrusive character of the measurement.
PWith said goals in mind, the next sections describe various phos-
phor particle characterisation methods and their advantages and
disadvantages in providing the necessary information.

4.3. Characterisation methodology

PFirst we present methods to study particles in bulk powder form,
taken to mean the case where the particles are densely packed as a
powder or coating. However, when the intended application is fluid
temperature measurements, there are some limitations to studying
particles in this way, and so secondly we introduce procedures used
to characterise dispersed particles.

P4.3.1. Bulk powder methods

PThe luminescence emission spectrum and lifetime of many phos-
phors are available from literature, usually measured from particles
in the form of bulk powder. The books “The Phosphor Handbook”
[158] and “Inorganic Phosphors” [164] cover thousands of materials.
However, often the effects of temperature are not known, unless
either this has a strong effect on the luminescence pertaining to the
phosphors intended original application, e.g., lighting, displays, or
the phosphor has been studied for surface thermometry (see for
example reviews [10(cid:1)12] and reports [41,165,166]).

PSpectroscopy instruments

PIf no information is available, the spectral/temporal temperature
response of a small amount (gram quantities) of powder can be read-
ily determined. Simple setups consisting of a spectrometer and a
line/array detector (CCD or intensified CCD) provide spectrally-
resolved detection of the luminescence emission. In characterisation
experiments of bulk powders, the material is placed in a ceramic
crucible inside a temperature-controlled environment, often a fur-
nace (tube or chamber type) with optical access. Temperature gra-
dients across the powder sample must be minimised, so that a
thermocouple or resistance thermometer placed in the vicinity sup-
plies an accurate measure of the temperature of the particles probed.
Systems that permit variation of total system pressure and/or purg-
ing with different gases must be used to determine cross-sensitivity
of the luminescence emission to for example O2 partial pressure (e.g.
Refs. [13,191,192]). The excitation light is directed onto the sample
and the luminescence emission is collected and focused onto the
entrance slit of a spectrometer, see for example Fig. 21. Except for
very spectrally sharp transitions, for example trivalently-doped
rare-earths, spectral resolution is not a limiting factor and small USB

PInterferences in bulk powder studies

PThe material state of the powder in such investigations is impor-
tant, and is described most elegantly in the Phosphor Handbook
“The optical properties of a particle depend on the state of assem-
blage of particles; a dilute dispersion of particles has different prop-
erties from thick powder aggregates such as those encountered in
powder beds or in paints. In the former state, the optical character of
individual particles dominates, whereas in the latter, complicated
multiple scattering occurs.”

PFor example, in fluid thermometry experiments the particle dis-
persion is dilute to the extent that the luminescence signal is directly
proportional to the absorption cross-section. In a packed bed of
powder, strong multiple scattering between particles of both the
excitation light and the emitted luminescence means that the overall
luminescence signal will also be a function of the scattering cross-
section and the arrangement of particles. Thus it is impossible to
conduct a complete analysis to recover the signal from an individual
particle [158]. Yet it is the per particle emission intensity or the sig-
nal from a given mass of particles in a diluted state that are the
parameters of critical interest for flow measurements. For the pur-
pose of comparing phosphors, simply keeping the mass of bulk pow-
der the same is not sufficient. The propagation of light through the
bed may be approximated using several approaches (Kubel-
ka(cid:1)Munk, the Johnson method, Monte(cid:1)Carlo simulation - for
details refer to [158], Chapter 16). Still, the excitation penetration
depth will be difficult to ascertain exactly, and therefore to know the
mass of particles that emits the detected signal and the excitation
irradiance that was used. In fact, light propagation in packed pow-
ders is of significance for surface thermometry because it determines
at which location(s) inside the phosphor coating the temperature is
effectively measured from, complicating the interpretation of the
results [197,198].

PClearly it is difficult to obtain results representative of individual
dispersed particles when examining bulk powders or dense coatings.
Here we also describe two series of experiments conducted in our
laboratory which show additional complications that may arise in
characterisation studies of bulk powder.

PIn the first experiment, a stack of BAM:Eu2þ powder (Phosphor
Technology KEMK63/UF-P1) was intermittently illuminated by a
pulsed laser emitting at 355 nm with a fluence of 80 mJ/cm2 and
pulse duration of 10 ns. The laser was operated at 15 Hz and, when
needed, blocked for many pulses using a shutter. With the aim of
measuring the intensity ratio independently of the high-irradiance
excitation, halfway between two laser pulses (blocked or not), the
same powder was illuminated by a 0.5 mW 308 nm LED during 1 ms,
resulting in a fluence of a few mJ/cm2. The luminescence emission
spectrum from the powder was recorded during the LED pulse using
a spectroscopy system similar to that in Fig. 21. For each LED pulse,
an intensity ratio was derived from the spectral data using the trans-
mission functions of the spectral filters used in imaging experiments,
so that the ratio is a monotonic function of particle temperature.

PThe results are presented in Fig. 23. Note that at the start of the
recording sequence, the pulsed laser had been firing at a fixed flu-
ence for several minutes. The intensity ratio measured with LED
illumination between laser pulses is higher than the intensity ratio
measured when the laser illumination is turned completely off (as
indicated by the dotted line). Using the spectral data presented in
Fig. 7 and recorded at 1 mJ/cm2, the temperature difference is esti-
mated to be » 200 K, although the relevance of this estimate is not
certain due to the several orders of magnitude difference between
both fluences. Between t » 8 and t » 14 s, the powder was no longer
illuminated by the laser, and the intensity ratio indicates a near
exponential decay behaviour with a relaxation time of several sec-
onds which may reflect the the cooling time in the bulk powder.
When the illumination of the powder by the laser was resumed, an
exponential rise in the intensity ratio was observed. This relatively

Pspectrometers can be used to cover a broad wavelength range. The
spectral transmission efficiency of the complete detection system
must be calibrated using a known reference spectrum, such as that
of a tungsten halogen lamp. This is necessary to recover the correct
relative intensity of different emission lines or spectral bands, espe-
cially if operating in spectral regions where the efficiency of the dif-
fraction grating, CCD quantum efficiency, or collection lens/objective
are steeply changing.

PTo measure luminescence decay times a PMT or (amplified) pho-
todiode are commonly used. In some spectrometers, a rotating mir-
ror allows the direction of the dispersed light either towards the
sensor array or towards a slit, to which a PMT or photodiode can be
mounted so as to resolve spectra and decay times with a single sys-
tem. For phosphors in the millisecond range, spectrally resolved
luminescence decays can also be measured using a high speed CMOS
camera and a spectrometer, offering a comprehensive picture of the
luminescence transitions following a single laser shot [193]. Down-
sized or simplified systems e.g. using an optical fiber, and automated
systems for lifetime measurements have been developed, for exam-
ple by Emerging Measurements, Inc., Sensor Coating Systems Ltd,
and Lund University [194]. It is also instructive to measure the exci-
tation spectrum of the powder using for example an integrated fluo-
rescence spectrometer instrument.

PAdvantages

PInvestigating bulk phosphor powders in this way is a relatively
simple task. There are far more particles in the probe volume com-
pared with the dilute dispersion in the gas phase. Consequently the
signal level is generally high, even for low fluences, except for excep-
tionally inefficient phosphors or at extreme temperatures where the
transition is almost entirely thermally quenched. The particles do
not move or change within the probe volume as they would in a con-
tinuous flow, so conditions are easily reproduced. Investigating
luminescence at high temperatures or pressures can be achieved
using a small, convenient temperature controlled furnace or oven
system.

PLuminescence characterisation of bulk powder provides essential
information in designing experiments using the emission spectrum
and the lifetime measured over a range of temperatures. Sensitive
filter combinations can be chosen for ratio-based imaging, and the
most temperature sensitive emission line/band in a given tempera-
ture range for a phosphor can be chosen for the lifetime method.
Phosphors can be directly compared in this fashion. For example
Fig. 12 in Allison and Gilles [10] and Fig. 7 in Ald(cid:2)en et al. [11] (repro-
duced below in Fig. 22) are especially useful.

PStill, as discussed, the luminescence intensity is of critical impor-
tance. In principle, from bulk powder studies, it is possible to obtain
data on how the signal varies with temperature i.e. temperature
quenching, and as a approximate comparison, compare signal levels
between phosphors (in the bulk powder state) [195,196]. However,
there are some significant limitations to this approach.

Fig. 22. Temperature-dependence of the luminescence lifetime (left axis) and intensity ratio (right axis) of many common thermographic phosphors. Reproduced from Ref.[11].

Plong rise time indicates that there is a cumulative heating effect of
the powder, so that the energy deposited by the first pulse is not
fully dissipated before the next pulse, the temperature of the powder
increasing until the temperature difference between the powder and
the surroundings is large enough to dissipate the laser energy and
steady state is reached.

PThis may be compared with the case of individual particles in the
fluid phase. Section 5.2 shows that the cooling and heating time for a
2 mm particle, for example, is approximately 100 ms. In this case, at
least for repetition rates up to 10 kHz, the particles will completely
cool down between two laser pulses. Furthermore, at the typical rate
of 10 Hz, the same particles are not ordinarily probed by successive
laser pulses due to advection in and out of the probe volume by the
flow field. Therefore, repeated illumination of the bulk powder leads
to a cumulative heating effect that would not occur for individual
particles dispersed in a fluid. For example, in Ref. [16], a fluence of
70 mJ/cm2 was used to excite the same BAM:Eu2þ phosphor in bulk
powder form for spectroscopy. Indeed for some phosphors, fluences of
the order of 1000s mJ/cm2 were often used to obtain sufficient signal

Pin fluids. However, according to the results of the experiment above,
examining the luminescence emission at fluences relevant to fluid-
phase studies may always be complicated by heating and accompa-
nying hysteresis effects. Note that it cannot be excluded at that stage
that the observed behaviour under repeated illumination may partly
be due to some reversible photochemical effects.

PIn the second experiment, a stack of bulk ZnO powder (96479,
Sigma(cid:1)Aldrich) was illuminated using the third harmonic (355 nm)
of a Nd:YAG laser with a nominal pulse duration of 10 ns and pulse
repetition rate of 5 Hz. The laser energy was measured and the beam
area was adjusted using an iris (» 5 mm diameter) to provide a flu-
ence of 17 mJ/cm2. A time series of recorded spectra is shown in
Fig. 24.

PSome laser shots evidently cause a pronounced narrowing of the
emission peak and increase of the luminescence intensity. These do
not correlate with peaks in the pulse energy (7% pulse-to-pulse vari-
ation). Therefore this behaviour is random in this regime of laser flu-
ence. Previous studies of ZnO powder have attributed this irregular
behaviour to amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) [199,200]. The

P4(cid:1)5, indicating permanent damage possibly caused by cumulative
heat buildup. While the influence of laser-induced damage or lasing
action does depend on the phosphor (for example, no such behav-
iour was observed for BAM:Eu2þ for approximately the same range
of fluence), these experiments indicate that obtaining spectra free of
these types of interference may be difficult in bulk powder. Besides
laser induced heating, degradation, and amplified spontaneous
emission, it should be noted that heating bulk powder in a furnace
for extended periods (1 h) at high temperatures (1000 K) can alter
the crystalline structure of the powder, in turn degrading or improv-
ing the luminescence characteristics. This additional and potentially
prominent hysteresis effect in bulk powder must be checked after
the phosphor has cooled back to room temperature. Further discus-
sion may be found in Section 4.4.3.

PTo summarise, reliable measurements from dispersed particles
are not only needed to properly evaluate signals from thermographic
phosphors. They may also be required to avoid complications spe-
cific to the study of bulk powder that prevent the quantitative
transfer of information from powder studies to the fluid-phase.
Therefore, methods are required to characterise dilute particle dis-
persions, where the nature of the laser-particle interaction much
better matches the intended use for fluid flow experiments.

P4.3.2. Dispersed particle methods

PThere are several approaches to studying dilute dispersions of
particles. One may isolate single or a few particles using acoustic
waves or an electromagnetic field, or cast particles in a transparent
solid of some kind. Such methods would be attractive in that physi-
cal (size, shape) and luminescence properties could be correlated for
individual particles, providing very detailed fundamental informa-
tion. Particles can also be dispersed in a single droplet. In Ref. [27]
La2O2S:Eu3þ particles were mixed with distilled water in a ratio 1%
(by mass) and droplets with an initial diameter of approximately
2 mm were suspended in an acoustic levitator. Although droplet
heating during initial levitation, non-uniform particle distribution
within the droplet, motion/rotation of the droplet and droplet evap-
oration were all mentioned in this study, if these processes were
well-controlled then this method could be used to probe a few
particles. Interestingly, when the droplets completely evaporated,
Ref. [28] reported that particles remained suspended, so for a low
enough initial mass loading of the droplets, single particles could
potentially be studied in the gas phase without a liquid carrier.

POn the other hand, the process is time consuming to obtain sig-
nificant statistics relevant to a batch of phosphor and signal levels
may be low in relation to standard spectroscopic approaches
described above. Two approaches that have been used to character-
ise phosphor particles for flow thermometry in larger fluid volumes
are now described, suspension in liquids, and particle-gas streams
(aerosols).

PLiquids

PAdding a known mass of particles to a small quantity (10’s ml) of
liquid is one approach to study dispersed particles. Either lumines-
cence spectra or lifetime can be measured as described above, or the
luminescence signal measured for a given mass using a two-colour
system.

PA simple liquid characterisation method is to probe dispersions
contained in a cuvette or similar [15,38]. Both of the cited studies
found that ultrasonic dispersion was necessary to remove agglomer-
ates. Both also found that the number density of particles was not
constant in time, where either the particles sedimented at the bot-
tom of the tank (even with continuous ultrasonic agitation) [38], or
appeared to be attracted to the walls of the 30 ml fused silica cuvette
used in Ref. [15] (even with continuous stirring after initial disper-
sion by ultrasound). The latter study proposes the use of a container
with a larger volume to surface ratio or a recirculation system to

Fig. 23. Time series of the excitation laser fluence (top) and spectrally derived inten-
sity ratio determined under low fluence (mJ/cm2) LED excitation between two laser
pulses (bottom), for bulk BAM:Eu powder. The dotted line corresponds to the inten-
sity ratio measured when the laser is continuously off. See main text for additional
information.

Pemitted luminescence is multiply scattered by the particles and illu-
minates particles containing excited luminescent centres, thereby
amplifying the luminescence by stimulated emission. Two factors
are important, first that the transition probabilites and laser irradi-
ance are conducive to population inversion; and second that the
multiple scattering between particles provides optical feedback and
serves to increase the optical path length [201]. The occurrence of
ASE then depends on the particle size distribution, particle arrange-
ment and packing density [199]. This inherent inhomogeneity of the
packed bed leads to the random lasing behaviour. In comparison,
lasing action is presumed very unlikely within single particles acting
as a cavity, because the primary particle size is of the order of or (in
this case) shorter than the light wavelength; or in dilute dispersions,
because of the low solid angle subtended between individual
particles.

PAnother problem may be laser-induced damage of the phosphor
material. In the same experiment a ZnO powder stack was then sub-
jected to fluences in excess of 100 mJ/cm2 for several hundred laser
shots and then left for several minutes to allow any heat buildup to
dissipate. Afterwards the powder was visibly discoloured and the
emission intensity using a lower fluence was reduced by a factor

Pimprove the certainty in the mass of particles contributing to the
measured luminescence signal.

PUsing this approach only a small amount (milligrams) of powder
is required compared to seeding particles into gas flows (see below),
making the comparison of the signal levels from many different dis-
persed phosphor powders a simple matter. However, the tempera-
ture range is inherently limited with water or oils.

PGases

PFor the characterisation of particles dispersed in the gas phase,
the number of particles in the probe volume must be measured for
two reasons. First, the inherent difficulties in seeding mm-size par-
ticles into gas flows means that the rate of entrainment of particles
into the gas stream cannot be set and maintained over long enough
periods of time. The luminescence signal is coupled to these varia-
tions in the seeding density. Thus some method of accounting for
these variations is required, to independently assess the lumines-
cence signal when parameters such as the excitation fluence are
varied.

PSecond, as mentioned previously, if measurements in the gas
phase are to be used to compare two phosphors, it is necessary to
have an idea of how many particles are needed for a successful mea-
surement. In contrast to liquid studies where the initial mass of par-
ticles is controlled, in gases this is not so. The operation of seeders
(see Section 3.2.1) is such that large volumes of powder are needed
for the process of entrainment, but the rate of entrainment is com-
paratively very low and a significant portion of particles stick to
pipes so it is not possible to weigh the mass of particles which made
their way to the test section. Instead the number of particles in the
fluid must be measured.

POn the one hand, this additional diagnostic increases experimen-
tal complexity and furthermore normally larger (100 g) quantities of
powders are needed for the seeders ordinarily used for gas flows. On
the other hand, measuring in gases is a prerequisite to study dis-
persed particles at high temperatures and to examine the effect of
different bath gases for short time scales. Knowledge of the particle
number density has the additional benefit that the luminescence sig-
nal per particle is determined, which is more relevant to fundamen-
tal studies of laser-particle interaction because potentially, using
quantum efficiency data from the literature, the absorption cross
section can be derived. Note that by itself the mass concentration,
which can be measured in liquid phase studies, may not be reliably
related to the particle number density because the particle morphol-
ogy, state of agglomeration and size distribution are not known with
sufficient certainty.

PParticle counting

PA particle counting system was developed by Fond et al. [51].
Only a brief overview of the main considerations are outlined here.
The system is based on laser-sheet illumination and high-resolution
imaging of the particle Mie scattering signal. It basically uses the
same hardware as for a PIV experiment, with a thin (100(cid:1)200 mm)
light sheet and camera equipped with imaging optics to facilitate a
high resolution to resolve closely spaced particles (the measured
spatial resolution of our systems used in, e.g., Refs. [13(cid:1)15,51] is
approximately 10 to 15 mm). Mie scattering images may then be
processed using a program that determines the number of local
maxima in each image, serving as a measure of the number of par-
ticles. To determine the particle number density, the laser sheet
thickness must be measured. The reader is referred to the original
article for details of this system [51].

PThe goal is to detect all the particles in the measurement volume
defined by the light sheet and camera field of view. The laser pulse
energy must be so that the peak intensities of weak particle scatter-
ing signals are sufficiently beyond the noise floor of the camera,
though it should be noted that it may be difficult to detect all of the

Pvery smallest particles amongst a given size distribution. Though the
size, shape and orientation of the particles affect the scattering
cross-section, for spherical particles, for example, the scattering
cross-section at 90° is only a weak function of particle diameter
between 500 nm and 3 mm. Therefore, particles in this size range
can be detected with equivalent certainty. The counting system
should be optimised i.e. by controlling the laser fluence, camera
dynamic range, and considering the particle image size and the cam-
era field of view; in order to specify the maximum number density
that can be measured. For example, a particle counting system is
also described by Lee et al. [16]. There Mie scattering images
recorded for PIV were used for counting purposes, which has the
advantage of experimental simplicity. The field of view of the cam-
era was therefore matched to that of the thermometry system and
the laser sheet thickness was between 450 and 700 mm. This has the
drawback that an order of magnitude less particles can be counted.
The cutoff threshold of 500 counts that was used to process the scat-
tering images may indicate that in this case small particles were
excluded from the number of particles counted. A system based on
Mie scattering at 355 nm and an intensifed CCD is also mentioned in
Ref. [186]. We also refer to a method derived from an LDV system,
for example Ref. [176]. By extracting the fraction of time
iti/T that
particles are inside the LDV probe volume pr2L, the particle number
density can be estimated at a fixed point in the flow using:

PA comparison of these different approaches and harmonisation of
the methods are important to compare future work by various
research groups.

PThe counting method of Ref. [51] has several advantages, fore-
most that it is simple: the same hardware as for a generic tempera-
ture-velocity imaging experiment is needed, and so some basic tests
of a new phosphor can be made quickly and with little effort. One
can easily compensate for fluctuating seeding levels which would
otherwise obscure possible trends of interest. Also, the number den-
sity and luminescence signals can be evaluated from the same par-
ticles in time and space, as opposed to using an additional LDV
probe or an extinction based technique. As an example, the system
was used to sample the luminescence intensity of BAM:Eu2þ par-
ticles for a fixed excitation laser fluence in a jet of air [51]. Fig. 25
shows a 10 Hz time series of the luminescence intensity before and
after correction with the simultaneously measured particle number
density. Before correction, the signal fluctuates due to the variable

Fig. 25. 10 Hz time series of the luminescence signal of BAM:Eu particles seeded into
a jet of air, for a fixed excitation fluence. Data is shown before and after correcting for
the instantaneous seeding density. Reproduced from Ref. [51].

Pseeding density; after correction, the fluctuations are strongly
reduced. Therefore the variation of the signal due to the variation of
another parameter such as the excitation laser fluence can then be
clearly discerned.

PMost important is that the method does not just account for
seeding fluctuations in a relative sense, but provides a quantitative
measure of the particle number density. For a given batch of phos-
phor, the number of photons emitted by a single, “average” phos-
phor particle can be determined, for known excitation parameters.
This quantity can also be determined using the thermographic
LDV probe [21] since it directly measures luminescence intensity of
individual particles. However, due to the cw excitation, only lower
range of fluence (» 10 mJ/cm2), and a low range of irradiance
(» 100 W/cm2) can be investigated, which cannot be readily related
to studies with pulse laser excitation.

PNote that once the luminescence intensity per particle is quanti-
fied, if in an actual thermometry experiment one operates within
the conditions the phosphor has been characterised (in terms of
excitation fluence and temperature) and knows the imaging and
camera parameters of the system well, the recorded luminescence
intensity can be used as a measure of the seeding density, to deter-
mine, for example, whether the flow is reasonably seeded. This
approach can also be used to calibrate the Mie scattering intensity of
the PIV images at room temperature, to then in turn use the PIV
images themselves as a 2D measure of the seeding density for
unknown conditions (see Ref. [17]).

P4.3.3. Additional diagnostics

PLastly, of course additional characterisation methods deserve a
mention. In the context of fluid thermometry it is necessary to deter-
mine the particle size distribution using laser diffraction and Coulter
counter methods, the latter method providing the distribution of
volume-equivalent spheres. It is important to recognise the limita-
tions of these methods imposed by irregularly shaped particles.
Qualitative information about the particle morphology may be
obtained using SEM imaging. SEM images of BAM:Eu2þ and ZnO par-
ticles are shown on Fig. 8. The crystal structure may be examined
using X-ray diffraction. Thermal properties can be measured using a
variety of techniques for example differential scanning calorimetry
for the heat capacity (again being mindful of the difficulties related
to the study of inhomogeneous powders). Though invaluable, these
diagnostics are beyond the scope of this review and the reader
might wish to refer to books on particle technology and materials
characterisation.

4.4. Phosphor particle studies

PThis section illustrates various applications of the previously-
introduced systems to quantitively characterise the phosphor par-
ticles listed in Table 1, in the context of fluid temperature measure-
ments.

P4.4.1. Luminescence signal

POne of the primary goals is to benchmark phosphors to establish
how many particles are needed for temperature measurements, that
is, to provide a sufficient signal for an adequate temperature preci-
sion. The previously discussed luminescence imaging and particle
counting system was first used to probe 2.4 mm BAM:Eu2þ particles
seeded into an air flow [51]. It was shown that the recorded lumines-
cence signal was a linear function of the seeding density in the tested
range 1010(cid:1)2 £ 1011 particles/m3. The cited paper was novel in
establishing the particle number density to generate sufficient
luminescence signal to achieve a certain single-shot, pixel-to-pixel
temperature precision. At room temperature, a precision of § 12 K
( § 1s, 4% of the absolute temperature) at a spatial resolution of
600 mm can be achieved with BAM:Eu2þ at 2 £ 1011 particles/m3

Pand using pulsed (10 ns) 355 nm excitation at a fluence of
23 mJ/cm2. Knowledge of the absolute particle number density
made it possible to evaluate for example that in these conditions,
the particles have a negliglible effect on the bulk gas properties, as
discussed in Section 5.8.

PFollowing from this work, detailed studies of two phosphors
BAM:Eu2þ [13] and ZnO [14] ensued. Fig. 26 shows the relative signal
from these two phosphors as a function of particle number density.
A procedure outlined in Ref. [13] accounts for laser sheet thickness,
objective lens collection efficiency, filter transmission and camera
parameters (ADC conversion, chip quantum efficiency, (binned)
pixel size) and field of view in the evaluation of the luminescence
emission intensity on per particle basis. One reason for the develop-
ment of this procedure is to facilitate comparison of particle charac-
terisation experiments conducted with completely different setups,
so the signals plotted in Fig. 26 are representative of the total lumi-
nescence emission of the dispersed particles. The aforementioned
linear behaviour of signal with particle number density is evident.

PEach of these phosphors has a somewhat different morphology as
revealed by SEM imaging, as shown on Fig. 8. The BAM:Eu2þ par-
ticles are hexagonal disc-type shapes [13], with a median diameter
based on volume of 2.4 mm as measured using a Coulter counter by
the manufacturer. Images of the ZnO particles reveal » 200 nm pri-
mary particles in the form of 1(cid:1)2 mm agglomerates [14]. Though the
projected size is similar, the exact distribution of size and shape is
unknown, as are the absorption coefficients and quantum efficien-
cies. Nevertheless, by the counting measurements the luminescence
signal in the gas phase could then be compared for the same level of
particle seeding, indicating that for practical measurements the sig-
nal is in a similar range for both phosphors. Consequently, for filters
which integrate a similar fraction of the total luminescence intensity
the single-shot, pixel-to-pixel precision of the recorded intensity
ratio images is the same. However, comparing the spectra in Figs. 7
and 9, quite evidently the spectral shift of ZnO is more pronounced
than that of BAM:Eu2þ for the same temperature difference, so the
temperature sensitivity is higher, as shown in Fig. 27. As a conse-
quence, it was demonstrated that a threefold improvement in the
temperature precision could be achieved for the same particle num-
ber density, laser fluence, collection efficiency and final spatial reso-
lution. These results exemplify the need to compare measured
luminescence signals (and temperature precision) for the same seed-
ing density.

PAlso, the procedure in Ref. [13] permits calculation of the number
of photons emitted by a single particle. BAM:Eu2þ and ZnO particles
in air produce » 3 £ 106 photons/particle using pulsed (10 ns)

Pfluence of 1.5 J/cm2 at 355 nm. This value, adjusted for temperature,
was found to be consistent with measurements in a flame, where
the number of particles was estimated using a calibrated scattering
technique. Presuming this value is correct, for reasonable exposure
times in turbulent flows (e.g. 15 ms as used for YAG:Dy3þ in Ref.
[178]) the signal level at room temperature would be 1(cid:1)2% of that
from BAM:Eu2þ for the same seeding density and presuming the
entire 440(cid:1)500 nm luminescence band of YAG:Dy3þ is detected. The
luminescence of a known number of dispersed YAG:Dy3þ;Er3þ par-
ticles was investigated in a recent study [186], but no quantification
of the luminescence intensity per particle was reported.

PFacing a lack of signal with this phosphor, in several studies the
authors chose an alternative phosphor, and offered some compari-
son. Jordan and Rothamer compared YAG:Dy3þ particles with YAG:
Pr3þ particles, presumably of the same grade (1.8 mm), finding that
(using a 50 ms exposure) the YAG:Pr3þ signals were a factor 60 and
230 £ higher than those of YAG:Dy3þ for the strongest and weakest
channels respectively [46]. The study of Lawrence et al. concluded
that 10.2 mm YAG:Dy3þ particles produce a high enough signal for
average temperature measurements up to 850 K in a jet of air, but
2.5 mm particles do not. 2.9 mm BAM:Eu2þ particles, however, were
found to produce sufficient signal for single shot measurements and
were recommended [35]. However, unfortunately these assessments
were not compared for a known seeding density.

PRef. [38] provides two interesting findings derived from experi-
ments where the mass load of dispersed particles was kept constant.
First, it was shown that the time integrated emission of YAG:Dy3þ
was » 20 times weaker than YVO4:Eu3þ; a result to be expected
since the absorption through the YVO4 host is more efficient than
the forbidden 4f-4f transition of dysprosium in the YAG host. Second,
the luminescence emission of YAG:Dy3þ particles with diameter
< 50 nm was weaker than YAG:Dy3þ particles of the order 1 mm.
Results like these raise interesting questions related to host-dopant
combinations or composition; or for example whether the particle
luminescence depends on the square (i.e. surface area) or cube (i.e.
volume) of the particle diameter. This study is also notable for its
use of rare-earth doped nanoparticles, which are having major
impact in fields such as biomedicine [203], optoelectonics including
laser sources and solar cells [204], and thermometry at sub-mm-
scales [54,55].

P4.4.2. Thermal quenching

P2.4 mm BAM:Eu2þ particles have been studied in a jet of heated
air to study the dependence of the luminescence signal on the tem-
perature [13]. Particle counting was implemented to correct for the
seeding density and obtain the curve shown in Fig. 28. The results
indicate that at 920 K the luminescence signal per particle is 10% of
the room temperature intensity. Ref. [13] also plots the same data
per unit volume of gas, which is the relevant parameter for constant
pressure experiments. The luminescence intensity is 3% of the room
temperature value if the drop in particle number density due to gas
thermal expansion is taken into account.

PThe same data was also recorded in a similar manner, for dis-
persed ZnO 1(cid:1)2 mm particles in air [14]. These results, also shown
Fig. 28 indicate rather more significant quenching, where at 475 K
the signal per particle was reduced to 25% of the room temperature
intensity. Characterisation at temperature above 475 K would be
useful, as ZnO has a strong temperature sensitivity.

PConsidering lower temperatures, it should be noted that in gen-
eral there is no immediate reason why a phosphor should not also
be sensitive for at least some part of the temperature range below
room temperature, and in fact, depending on the onset of thermal
quenching, signal levels may be significantly higher than at room
temperature. Spectra for Mg4FGeO6:Mn4þ and La2O2S:Eu3þ at 11 K
have been measured [205]; La2O2S:Eu3þ was used for surface tem-
perature measurements down to 193 K [206], for example. Spectra

Fig. 27. Temperature calibration curves and sensitivity for ZnO and BAM:Eu2þ. Cali-
bration data for ZnO is derived from flow measurements in the heated gas; for BAM:
Eu2þ; intensity ratios were extracted from digitally-integrated luminescence spectra
(from Ref. [19]). A fit (of the form a þ bIRc) to the datapoints is shown. The evaluated
sensitivity, based on the fit of intensity ratio to temperature, is plotted in dashed lines
and can be read on the right axis. Reproduced from Ref. [14] with permission from

P355 nm excitation at fluences » 20 mJ/cm2 (the value of fluence is
not critical due to saturation of the luminescence signal, see below).
Such absolute measures of the signal are essential to compare results
between different experiments or laboratories/research groups, and
useful for planning experiments in challenging applications.

PIn Ref. [15], the same type of ZnO particles (96479, Sigma(cid:1)
Aldrich) were dispersed using ultrasound in deionised water, finding
that the same signal is emitted per particle in water and air. For a
known mass load, the number of particles was also counted to show
that 1 mg of particles in 1 L of water (0.0001% by mass) corresponds
to » 5 £ 1011 particles/m3. In liquids this mass load of ZnO affords
high signal levels and a good precision ( § 3 K at 298 K). Miller et al.
used a similar mass load of 2.5 mg/L for point measurements using
La2O2S:Eu3þ [24]. Relating this to those phosphors listed in Table 1
where some indication of the seeding density was reported, it is sur-
prising to note that mass loads 3(cid:1)4 orders of magnitude higher
(0.1(cid:1)1%) were reportedly used in liquids [26(cid:1)29,38,42,172]. In fact,
Ref. [171] used 10%. This could be due to a non-optimised experi-
mental setup for example weak excitation, poor collection efficiency,
detection strategy; or it could be because the phosphors used have
poor absorption and a low quantum efficiency, or a long lifetime
where a short exposure must be used to freeze a fast-moving flow.
Note that useful information on the probable room temperature rel-
ative intensity of the phosphors in Table 1 can be established just by
considering the luminescence spectra and lifetime. For La2O2S:Eu3þ;
the 5D2 line used for lifetime-based thermometry emits only » 0.3 %
of the total luminescence emission at 300 K, due to quenching via
the low lying charge transfer state to the 5D1 and 5D0 levels [202].
For Y3Al5O12:Pr3þ; most of the emission is via the allowed 4f5d-4f
luminescence not used for thermometry, as shown on the corre-
sponding emission spectrum of Fig 4. Clearly, it is not favourable
that much of the absorbed excitation energy is lost to transitions not
used for thermometry, but this is by no means a complete picture
and highlights that further investigations are required to determine
the relative signal level of dispersed particles at room temperature.

PIn addition to BAM:Eu2þ and ZnO, there are many gas phase stud-
ies using YAG:Dy3þ as evidenced by Table 1. The stated reason is nor-
mally to achieve measurements at flame temperatures, and
historically the basis for using this phosphor is because lumines-
cence signals in packed powder in a furnace have been obtained at
nearly 2000 K [30]. However there are only a few studies which pro-
vide information about the signal, either as an estimate or relative
measure.

PRef. [49] estimates the number of photons for a 1.7 mm YAG:Dy3þ
particle as 2 £ 106 at room temperature, albeit using a very high

PTwo studies have tested the effect of oxygen partial pressure on
the luminescence of YAG:Dy3þ by placing the powder in a furnace,
and changing the bath gas. Feist et al. showed that the oxygen partial
pressure has no effect on the emission lifetime in the tested range
0.21(cid:1)1 bar [191] while Yu et al. showed that the temperature
dependence of emission spectrum is also not affected in the range
0.21 to 1 bar [34]. ZnO:Zn and ZnO:Ga powders were also investi-
gated for O2 concentrations of 0(cid:1)100% at pressures up to 4.5 bar and
temperatures up to 400 K, revealing no difference in the emission
spectra [42]. A study performed in an oxygen-free environment (sili-
cone oil) showed that the luminescence of BAM:Eu2þ is insensitive
to pressures of up to 1000 bar [208]. The slight dependencies of the
luminescence emission of many phosphors at very high pressures
(1000’s bar) is summarised in Ref. [10]. Mg4FGeO6:Mn4þ; La2O2S:
Eu3þ and Y2O3:Eu3þ powders were also exposed to a range of gases
including N2, O2, CO2, CH4, He and water vapour at 10 bar, using air
as a reference [192]. Temperatures were varied by placing the gas
chamber inside a tube furnace. The decay times were measured for
the appropriate range of temperature for these phosphors, finding
that for Mg4FGeO6:Mn4þ and La2O2S:Eu3þ there was no influence of
the gas composition or pressure on the decay time.

POn the other hand, Y2O3:Eu3þ showed decreasing decay times for
increasing O2 concentration. This was also confirmed by the study of
Feist et al. [191]. A recent study attributed this phenomenon to diffu-
sion of oxygen vacancies towards the surrounding oxygen-contain-
ing environement [209]. These undesired effects prompted the
synthesis of the phosphors Y3Al5O12:Eu3þ and YAlO3:Eu3þ as alterna-
tive phosphors for surface thermometry [162].
in
contrast to Y2O3:Eu3þ [192], it was found for Y3Al5O12:Eu3þ that in a
reducing environment the lifetime decreases, which would rule out
any effect of oxygen quenching.

Interestingly,

PIn liquids, for La2O2S:Eu3þ; there was no difference in the mea-
sured luminescence lifetime between particles dispersed in LiBr sol-
utions and bulk powder [24]; or between particles dispersed in
isooctane and when the phosphor was coated on a surface [26].
However for Mg4FGeO6:Mn4þ a shift in the luminescence spectrum
was noted when the particles were dispersed in water or n-dodec-
ane, corresponding to a temperature difference of 4 K in the inten-
sity ratio calibration curve, which was deemed significant relative to
the low shot-to-shot standard deviation of 0.5 K [29]. As already
mentioned, the signal of ZnO particles dispersed in water or seeded
in air is the same [15].

PThe duration of the exposure to these environments was at least
a few minutes, but the duration may have an influence in these
reversible processes, in particular if the process requires diffusion
through the solid as it is the case for Y2O3:Eu3þ; which showed a
dependence on the O2 concentration. It is not clear whether the par-
ticles would immediately respond to changes in the environment on
shorter timescales, encountered for example in a flame.

POxygen quenching for BAM:Eu2þ was investigated by heating a
jet of pure N2 seeded with particles [13]. The results are presented in
Fig. 29, indicating no difference in the signal per particle for O2 par-
tial pressures up to atmospheric conditions. It was also shown that
the intensity ratio response is also unaffected by oxygen concentra-
tions in the same range [13]. Together these results mean that with
BAM:Eu2þ there is no compromise in either the temperature preci-
sion (due to decreased signal) or accuracy (altered intensity ratio) of
the measurements caused by varying O2 concentrations.

PPermanent changes have also been observed for various phos-
phors. Mg4FGeO6:Mn4þ exposed to temperatures of 1173 K [40]
showed a significantly shorter decay time at room temperature than
untreated samples. Irreversible changes to the decay time of Y2O3:
Eu3þ were observed after changing the absolute air pressure, an
effect which is enhanced by increasing the temperature [192]. The
thermal degradation of BAM:Eu2þ has been investigated in detail
because of its significance for the manufacture of plasma display

Fig. 28. Normalised luminescence signal for dispersed BAM:Eu2þ particles [13] and
for ZnO particles [14] in heated jets of air. Data from spectroscopic studies of bulk
BAM:Eu2þ powder are also plotted, extracted from the spectra in Ref. [13].

Pof BAM:Eu2þ particles down to 217 K were presented as part of a gas
turbine film cooling flow study where the phosphor particles were
used to measure temperatures in a liquid-N2-cooled cooling air flow
[20]. For ZnO, the temperature dependence of the emission spec-
trum in the range 10(cid:1)300 K was measured, illustrating a high tem-
perature sensitivity at least down to 150 K [207].

PThere is a lack of data on the temperature-dependence of the
luminescence emission intensity for the other phosphors listed in
Table 1, as dispersed particles. This is especially true for higher tem-
peratures where normally signals are low, but this is the range of
interest for flame studies. One issue is that it is not simple to estab-
lish stable and uniform gas flows at temperatures beyond 1000 K.
Instead, as previously mentioned (and accepting the perhaps large
errors stemming from optical interactions between packed par-
ticles), one must turn to results taken from bulk powder, as a guide.
From using the absolute intensity data from the spectra in Fig. 7
obtained from bulk powder, and applying the appropriate filter
curve, the additional curve shown on Fig. 28 results, which qualita-
tively agrees with the results of gas-phase studies.

PMeasurements of the luminescence lifetime as a function of
temperature can also be used as an approximation of quenching
behaviour. The decrease in lifetime is mainly due to an increased
non-radiative transition rate, so it is closely linked to the drop in
phosphor quantum efficiency. However such an approach has
limitations, since the total signal which is of interest is also a
function of the absorption probability and overlap of the absorp-
tion band with the excitation laser line.
Indeed it should be
noted that the trends of lifetime and total luminescence emission
with temperature do not always agree. BAM:Eu2þ is an example:
the lifetime starts decreasing only above 600 K [41], whereas the
results of Fig. 28 show that the emission intensity has already
dropped to 50% at this temperature.

P4.4.3. Fluid environment

PThe luminescence of thermographic phosphors originates from
centers within the crystal lattice. Therefore, in principle, a significant
advantage is that the luminescence emission is unaffected by the
surrounding fluid environment. In general there are two matters at
hand: 1) whether the luminescence depends on the local environ-
ment i.e. by quenching mechanisms, and 2) whether the particles
are affected by exposure to different conditions (for example,
extreme temperatures, types of liquid e.g. fuel, etc.), via chemical
reactions and/or diffusion. Such changes can be reversible or perma-
nent. Also a distinction should be made between sensitivity of the
measured quantity (intensity ratio, lifetime) and/or the total lumi-
nescence emission (signal) to the environment.

Psuggest that BAM:Eu2þ particles may be used for measurements
downstream of flames, in the exhausts of large combustion facilities,
or in cases where exhaust gases are recirculated within the burner
or trapped in the cylinder of IC engines, as long as the particles are
not in this environment for extended periods of time.

PTo summarise, if a phosphor is unaffected during exposure to a
range of conditions for an extended duration (tens of minutes to
hours), for example for La2O2S:Eu3þ; one could infer that for short
exposures, for example the time between seeding to a gas stream
and probing in the test section, the phosphor is also unaffected and
can be used without concern about cross-dependencies. On the
other hand, to take BAM:Eu2þ as an example, temperatures in the
region 900 K unquestionably cause degradation in air over long
durations ( >30 mins) but this is not an issue if exposed for a short
(seconds) duration, as the comparison between dispersed particles
in air and in nitrogen indicated.

PSince the effect of various processes of diffusion, oxidation, and
phase change (and even sublimation and melting) on the tempera-
ture measurement must depend on the exposure time, the intended
application of a phosphor must be considered. In liquid studies the
particles are generally immersed for a long time either in the test
object (e.g. convection tank) or before delivery to the test section
(e.g. injection rail). An investigation of the longer term effect of spe-
cific fuels, e.g., methanol, Jet-A, n-dodecane (as mentioned above in
Ref. [29]) would seem warranted. Also, some of these effects might
be surface related and in that case smaller particles might be influ-
enced differently. The overall picture, though, is that the touted
advantage of thermographic phosphor particles as being robust trac-
ers seems justified. This is a key feature compared with many LIF
tracers, which are sensitive to the fluid environment (in particular
the oxygen partial pressure), are chemically active and burn in
flames.

P4.4.4. Laser excitation effects

PThe excitation process is key to the luminescence emission. The
wavelength, linewidth, irradiance and duration of the excitation
may influence the luminescence characteristics, for example, emis-
sion intensity, spectrum, and rise time and decay time in the case of
pulsed excitation.

PLuminescence signal

PAn examination of Table 1 indicates that most studies have used
the third or fourth harmonics of pulsed Nd:YAG lasers. These typi-
cally have pulse durations of around 8(cid:1)10 ns, with which it is easy
to generate peak powers of the order of MWs and more. While stud-
ies have used a wide range of fluence, between 5 mJ/cm2 [14] to
more than 3.3 J/cm2 [49], few have reported the variation in the
luminescence signal with laser fluence for a given phosphor when
the particles are dispersed in a fluid.

PThe dependence of the luminescence signal of BAM:Eu2þ par-
ticles on the laser fluence was investigated in a free jet of air using
pulsed 355 nm excitation [44,51]. For this study it was necessary to
count particles to ensure that fluctuations in the seeding density
were accounted for. These results are shown in Fig. 30, revealing
that the luminescence signal departs from linear behaviour at
around 2(cid:1)3 mJ/cm2 and the rate of increase of the signal with laser
fluence continuously drops. At a fluence of 400 mJ/cm2 the lumines-
cence intensity was an order of magnitude lower than that expected
from linear behaviour [51].

PThis behaviour was termed “saturation”, and in this review we
use the same terminology. Note that the continued rise in signal
intensity in the saturation curve might be expected because the
“wings” of the Gaussian laser beam are never in the fully saturated
regime leading to a component of the signal that always increases.
Measurements with a homogenised “top hat” laser beam would be
useful in this respect. This is also true for studies of bulk powder,

Fig. 29. Normalised luminescence signal for dispersed BAM:Eu2þ particles in heated
jets of air and nitrogen [13]. The luminescence signal of BAM:Eu2þ particles measured
in the exhaust gases of an H2/CH4 (96.9%/3.1%) diffusion flame [17] are also presented.

Ppanels. Many studies reported evidence of degradation occuring in
BAM:Eu2þ powder samples after extended 1 h exposure to tempera-
tures exceeding 770 K [210], conditions typical of display panel
manufacture [211]. There are two effects, first that the oxidation
state of the europium ions increases from 2+ to 3+, causing a marked
and permanent drop in the blue divalent emission and the appear-
ance of the sharp red lines of the trivalent ions (see Refs. [212,213]
for a detailed discussion of the use of this reponse for thermal his-
tory sensing). Second, this in turn modifies the crystal field experi-
enced by the remaining divalent ions causing a small shift of the
broad blue line [213]. To avoid this effect, in Ref. [13], the spectra of
BAM:Eu2þ was measured up to 1100 K in a box furnace flushed with
N2. After this treatment, a near negligible difference in the room
temperature spectrum (0.1 nm blueshift) was observed.

PSuch results prompt the question of whether phosphor particles
are irreversibly damaged if exposed to extreme temperatures for
very short times, which would be typically encountered in flames. In
the 2010 study of Yu et al., YAG:Dy3þ particles were collected after
passing through a 2000 K flame and calibrated to determine if the
intensity ratio response was the same as an unexposed YAG:Dy3þ
sample. The temperature sensitivity was unchanged [34]. Van Lipzig
et al. used BAM:Eu2þ for temperature imaging in a high pressure
combustion chamber, and compared the pre-combustion, room-
temperature intensity ratio, with calibration curves obtained from
the cooling phase post-combustion (see description in Section 6.3
for more detail). Their results seem to indicate that the intensity
ratio remained unchanged after exposure to temperature of nearly
2000 K [37]. This result is consistent with the minor spectral change
observed for long exposure times (see Ref.
[213]). However,
no information was provided on a possible decrease in emission
intensity per particle after combustion, which in view of the above-
mentioned studies is a more suitable marker of degradation. Unfor-
tunately the Yu et al. study did not compare the luminescence
intensity of bulk YAG:Dy3þ powder before and after flame exposure
either [34].

PIn a recent study, the luminescence intensity of BAM:Eu2þ par-
ticles was measured in the post-flame region of a hydrogen non-pre-
mixed flame to investigate the survivability [17]. Particles were
probed directly in the flow, downstream of the flame after mixing of
the (seeded) exhaust gases with ambient air. In this case, it was esti-
mated from the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations,
that the particles have resided for 0.5(cid:1)1 s at temperature above
1700 K (up to maximum of 2400 K). The luminescence intensity,
temperature and seeding density were measured for regions of the
flow containing particles. The result, also shown in Fig. 29, indicates
that the luminescence emitted by these particles at temperatures of
500 K matches the luminescence intensity of particles at the same
temperature that have not been exposed to flames. These results

Pfluences » 10 mJ/cm2 means that high-speed diode-pumped Nd:
YAG lasers, with pulse energies nearly two orders of magnitude
lower, can be used for kHz-rate temperature imaging as in Refs.
[19,20].

PThese studies of dispersed particles are also important to charac-
terise phosphors and understand where gains in signal might be
made. Excitation scans at high laser fluences using, for example, a
dye laser or OPO, may be different from the low power density exci-
tation spectra examples shown in Fig. 4. The tests described here
with different excitation wavelengths and linewidths are only a
start. Though useful for achieving temporal resolution, extremely
high laser irradiance with ns pulsed lasers may be a significant factor
in saturation behaviour because the photon arrival rate is so high
relative to processes of relaxation (luminescence) or internal enegy
transfer between excited states of the luminescent centres.

PUsing lasers with longer pulse durations, say that generated with
a pulse stretcher (which are employed to prevent laser-induced
breakdown in diagnostic situations where high-energy ns pulses are
used, for example, for spontaneous Raman scattering [215], or CARS
[216]), may be fruitful to study the effect of irradiance and increase
the luminescence signal.

PLuminescence spectrum and lifetime

PIt is clearly preferable if the luminescence spectrum and lifetime
are independent of the excitation irradiance. Note that in a tempera-
ture measurement situation, excitation will be performed with the
laser with a fixed wavelength and bandwidth but the laser irradiance
may change. In normal experiments, the excitation irradiance varies
spatially due to the laser beam profile and may fluctuate temporally
or spatially. The review of Allison & Gillies in 1997 already remarked
that “there is evidence for a decrease in fluorescence decay time
with increasing laser fluence” [10]. This was reported, for example,
for Mg4FGeO6:Mn4þ powder samples and coatings at room tempera-
ture and 855 K using a 355 nm Nd:YAG laser at a 10 Hz repetition
rate [40] and Mg2TiO4:Mn4þ coatings at room temperature using a
266 nm diode-pumped Nd:YAG laser at a 6 kHz repetition rate
[217]. In the latter article this effect is attributed to laser-induced
heating caused by the high average power of the high-speed laser.

PLuminescence emission spectra from 4.2 mm BAM:Eu2þ phos-
phor particles dispersed in a free flow of air at ambient conditions,
were recorded as a function of 355 nm laser fluence by Lind(cid:2)en
et al. in 2009 [50]. They detected the luminescence signal using
a spectrometer coupled to an intensified CCD camera. Over the
range 0.1 J/cm2 to 1.5 J/cm2, no measurable difference in the
luminescence spectrum or the intensity ratio derived from two spec-
tral bands (400 § 20 nm and 456 § 5 nm) could be ascertained.
It was reported that a fluence of 10 J/cm2, however, caused laser-
induced breakdown. Ref. [46] observed a similar behaviour for YAG:
Pr3þ and YAG:Dy3þ particles. Later, again in a free flow of ambient
air, our group studied 2.4 mm BAM:Eu2þ particles using a two-cam-
era system to evaluate the effect of the laser fluence on the intensity
ratio up to 400 mJ/cm2 [13]. Contrary to the Lind(cid:2)en study and
previously reported results of our own [44], a slight dependence of
the intensity ratio on the fluence was observed up to » 200 mJ/cm2,
beyond which the dependence was weak. By converting this inten-
sity ratio difference into an assumed temperature difference using
calibration data, the variation over this range of fluence, if uncor-
rected, amounts to approximately 50 K. Another study of dispersed
BAM:Eu2þ particles in air found a 5% increase in the intensity ratio
from » 10(cid:1)80 mJ/cm2 at 295 K, which can be translated to » 5 K,
but no detectable increase over the same fluence range if the air was
heated to 615 K [16]. The study acknowledges that measurements
with lower uncertainties are needed and we agree that this is proba-
bly the reason for the aforementioned discrepancies in the various
findings. Similar issues were also noted in a study of YAG:Dy,Er par-
ticles [186]. Regardless, the functional temperature range of BAM:

355 nm laser fluence, normalised to the intensity at 10 mJ/cm2. Inset shows detail in
the range 1(cid:1)10 mJ/cm2. Reproduced from Ref. [51].

Pwhere the excitation fluence depends on the position in the bulk
powder, and the laser penetrates further into the bulk powder with
increasing fluence [44].

PWith the aim of increasing the signal, subsequent works exam-
ined the reasons for the saturation behaviour [13]. Ground-state
depletion of the active ions was identified as a consistent hypothesis
to examine. Europium ions reside in different sites within the BAM
crystal lattice [214], with the consequence that the ions have site-
dependent absorption characteristics. Following the theory of Ref.
[214], 266 nm and 355 nm excitations werecompared, with the aim
of targeting europium ions residing in different sites. For this, the
narrow-linewidth excitation of a pulsed Nd:YAG laser ( < 1 cm(cid:1)1)
was used. In addition, to test the possibility that narrow-linewidth
excitation only targets ions under the influence of a specific crystal
field, excitation using a broadband dye laser with a bandwidth of
200 cm(cid:1)1 at 376 nm was also tested. However, neither of these
approaches altered the saturation behaviour [13]. Regarding the
comparison of narrowband 266 and 355 nm excitation, either both
wavelengths in fact target the same site, or the europium population
is the same for each site.

PThe dependence of the emission intensity on excitation irradi-
ance was also studied for ZnO in air and in water, also showing evi-
dence of saturation [14,15]. 266 nm excitation was also investigated
with the original motivation to avoid the Raman scattering from
water which neatly overlaps the ZnO emission spectrum if using
355 nm [15]. The signal is a factor two lower using 266 nm excita-
tion, which agrees with the excitation spectrum which was also
measured in that study using a low-irradiance source (xenon lamp
and monochromator).

PA consequence of the saturation observed for BAM:Eu2þ and
ZnO is that no significant gain can be achieved by simply increasing
the laser fluence, at least for the excitation parameters tested. This
may not be true for other phosphors, for example a fluence of
500 mJ/cm2 was used to excite Y2O2S:Er3þ;Yb3þ [45], and 1.5 J/cm2
for YAG:Dy3þ [49]. An increase in luminescence signal by a factor 16
when the laser fluence was only increased by a factor 5 between 20
and 100 mJ/cm2 was reported for YAG:Dy3þ;Er3þ [186]. Disregarding
this latter, potentially erroneous result, it is possible that these
phosphors do not show saturation at these fluences, which is an
important consideration when comparing signal
levels between
phosphors. On the other hand, that sufficient signal for a good tem-
perature precision can be achieved with BAM:Eu2þ and ZnO at

Paveraging, for example detector noise, are distinguished from other
sources of systematic error which may affect both single shot
measurement and average measurements, for example calibration
errors.

5.1. Random uncertainty

PThe effect of random noise on the temperature measurement
depends on the emission intensity of the phosphor particles, the col-
lection and conversion efficiency of
the detection system,
the detector noise characteristics, the temperature sensitivity of the
method and phosphor used, and the temporal and spatial resolution.
For all approaches where in the probe volume there are several par-
ticles that contribute to a single measurement, the random noise
also depends on the particle number density. With knowledge of the
appropriate parameters the random error can be predicted. For
example, the model presented in Ref. [13] was used to compare the
precision of intensity ratio measurements using BAM:Eu2þ particles
and the predicted error. The comparison showed that the photon
sampling noise contributes to more than 50% of the measurement
precision. The addition of a fixed error term (independent of the
seeding density) was proposed to account for the remainder [13].
For conventional intensity ratio imaging this remaining error might
stem from residual displacement between the two particle images.
Actually, if the number of particles is increased the intensity field
becomes more homogeneous, and so the remaining error contribu-
tion may be better modelled as an inverse function of the seeding
density. On the other hand, for thermographic LDV, measurements
are performed on single particles and the seeding density does not
affect the random uncertainty.

PAn accurate model for random measurement uncertainty can be
used to decide whether measurements in a specific situation are fea-
sible, e.g., much larger field of view, improved spatial resolution, dif-
ferent laser fluence, for a given seeding density, and particularly at
higher temperatures, as done in Ref. [13] for BAM:Eu2þ. It enables
the theoretical comparison of different detectors, and, since an opti-
mum filter combination is a compromise of signal level and temper-
ature sensitivity,
to
compare a set of temperature measurements acquired with phos-
phor particles to other measurements or simulations, the theoretical
precision can be evaluated, and provided as an estimate of the mini-
mum uncertainty.

5.2. Particle tracing properties

PThe technique is based on the luminescence emission of solid
particles entrained in the flow, and it is the temperature and the
velocity of the particles that are measured. Any slip or temperature
difference between the particles and the surrounding fluid are sour-
ces of measurement error. The tracing abilities of phosphor particles
are addressed in the following.

Fig. 31. Effect of the laser fluence on the intensity ratio of ZnO particles in a free jet of
air at room temperature for 355 nm excitation and pulse durations of 10 and 170 ns.
Reproduced from Ref. [14] with permission from the Optical Society of America.

PEu2þ spans 200(cid:1)900 K and so relative to this, these small sources of
error can be reduced with simple corrective procedures as discussed
in Section 5.6.

PThe other phosphor that has been applied for fluid temperature
measurements and investigated in this respect is ZnO. The particles
have been studied in air using pulsed 355 nm excitation with two
different pulse durations (10 and 170 ns) [14]. The results are repro-
duced in Fig. 31. Using 10 ns excitation the intensity ratio of ZnO is
considerably more sensitive than for BAM:Eu2þ; a result confirmed
by Fan et al. [185]. Converting the intensity ratio difference between
5 and 60 mJ/cm2 into an assumed temperature difference using cali-
bration data indicates a 100 K difference. This prompted a detailed
examination of the intensity ratio-laser fluence dependence for ZnO
particles at different temperatures [14], to confirm the universal
applicability of corrective procedures to extract temperature field
measurements.

PSome investigations of the origin of the intensity ratio depen-
dence of ZnO were conducted [14]. Laser-induced particle heating
was identified as a plausible explanation for the intensity ratio
increase. Another possibility is that the high irradiance (MW/cm2)
generated with pulsed laser excitation has an effect on the lumines-
cence emission independent of heating. Fig. 31 also shows data
measured in the same study for the same total pulse energy but
significantly longer pulse duration (170 ns), generated using a intra-
cavity frequency-tripled diode-pumped Nd:YAG laser. At a given flu-
ence, a lower intensity ratio was observed with the longer excitation
pulse duration, from which it was inferred that part of the intensity
ratio increase with fluence can be attributed to the excitation irradi-
ance only. This is consistent with a redshift of the ZnO emission
caused by a decrease in the band gap with increasing density of
excited luminescent centres in the material [201].

5. Uncertainty analysis

PIn this section, possible measurement error sources related to
the use of phosphor particles in flows are considered. These are
classified as a temperature measurement uncertainty (precision
and accuracy) or in some cases, it is more straightforward to quan-
tify the error in terms of loss of temporal resolution (instanta-
neous measurement duration) or spatial resolution (measurement
probe volume). Generally only the temperature measurement is
is ordinarily
considered, because the velocity measurement
based on well-established techniques (PIV, LDV), for which error
analysis has been described elsewhere in the literature. Only a
short overview of the particle velocity tracing response is given
for comparison.

PIn the following, random uncertainties which affect the precision
of single shot measurements that can be reduced by statistical

P5.2.1. Temperature response

PTo evaluate the temperature response, a typical approach is to
consider a cold particle which is initially surrounded by a warmer
fluid, and analyse the evolution of the particle temperature over
time. This is representative of instantaneous heating, e.g. a particle
crossing a flame front. For the particle to match the fluid tempera-
ture, heat must be transferred from the fluid to the particle. In
addressing this heat transfer problem in the context of flow ther-
mometry using particle tracers, initial studies either considered heat
convection to the particles using a Nusselt number correlation
[31,39], or that the surface of the particle was initially at the gas
temperature and analysed the heat conduction within the particle
[34]. In 2012, two heat transfer analyses were provided indepen-
dently by van Lipzig et al. [37] and by our group [44]. Both

Precognised that even for relatively high slip between the fluid and
the micron-size particles, owing to the low Reynolds number of the
particles, the dominant mode of heat transfer is by conduction. Also
it was observed that the thermal conductivity of phosphor particles
(in the range 10(cid:1)30 W/m ¢ K) is orders of magnitude larger than that
of the fluid, and that the temperature of the particle can be consid-
ered uniform while the fluid locally changes temperature. The
change in the particle temperature is therefore limited by conduc-
tion heat transfer through the fluid.

PDifferent solutions to this problem have been implemented. First,
Konopliv and Sparrow had previously provided an analytical solu-
tion to Eq. (12) for constant (and uniform) fluid thermal properties
[218]. Second, our group solved for Eq. (12) using a finite-difference
numerical model. The advantage of this approach is that it can
account for local (temperature-dependent) fluid thermal properties,
as well as incorporate the effect of radiation from the particles to the
surroundings. This model was validated against results of the Kono-
pliv and Sparrow solution for uniform fluid thermal properties [44].

PThe response time is proportional to d2

p. For uniform fluid thermal
properties, in air at 2000 K, the 3t 95% response time calculated by
all three approaches are in excellent agreement, as shown in Table 2
for an undoped YAG crystal. This indicates that neglecting the time-
dependent term as in Eq. (17) is a valid assumption, owing to the
low volumetric heat capacity of air (and gases in general).

PHowever, for large temperature ranges, e.g. across a flame front,
the change in thermal properties of the fluid cannot be neglected.
Since the thermal conductivity of air increases from 26 W/m ¢ K to
more than 100 W/m ¢ K from 300 to 2000 K, the question arises:
which value of the fluid thermal conductivity should be used in
Eq. (19)? In this case, as heat is transfered from the gas to the parti-
cle, the temperature in the vicinity of the particle will cool down,
which will reduce its conductivity and therefore slows the heat
transfer [44]. Van Lipzig et al. evaluated the fluid thermal conductiv-
ity at the initial particle temperature of 300 K [37]. Using the numer-
ical model, it is possible to vary the fluid thermal properties in time
and space (distance r from the particle) as a consequence of the local
temperature. The numerical model was also adapted to account for
radiation assuming the particle as a pure blackbody (ɛ 1⁄4 1) [44].

PThe results of the numerical model are compared to those of the
lumped capacitance approach for the thermal conductivity evalu-
ated both at the initial particle temperature and at the fluid temper-
ature in Table 3. Using the cold thermal conductivity overestimates
the response time by a factor 3. Using the hot thermal conductivity
value results in a slight underestimate of t95% (-24%). This result sup-
ports the use of Eq. (19) as a simple estimation of the particle
response time, with the recommendation that the thermal conduc-
tivity is evaluated at the initial fluid temperature.

PNote that, because Eq. (19) is independent of the step difference
in the fluid temperature that is imposed on the particle, the result
on the second line of Table 3 may be used as a guide for the response
time for a particle undergoing a small temperature change around
300 K.

PRadiation was shown to play very little role, even at 2000 K, with
the response time hardly changing and the final particle tempera-
ture being only 10 K lower than the initial fluid temperature [44].
For mm-size particles, the heat gained or lost by radiation is rapidly

Pbalanced by heat conduction from the fluid. A consequence of this in
combustion is that the influence of radiation from the flame on par-
ticles in the cold reactants is largely unimportant. This is a particu-
larly important result were thermographic phosphor particles used
as flame front marker, as suggested in Ref. [219].

PThe thermal conductivity of liquids is typically an order of
magnitude higher than in gases, so broadly speaking larger par-
ticles can be used for an equivalent response time. The same
numerical model was used by our group to assess the response
time of 5 mm ZnO particles in water [15]. Between 273 and
373 K, the 95% response time is < 35 ms. The thermal diffusivity
of liquids is several orders of magnitude smaller than in gases.
Because the lumped capacitance approach neglects the time-
dependent term, even for fixed fluid thermal properties, there is
an error which increases with decreasing thermal diffusivity. For
comparison, at 293 K the response time evaluated by Eq. (19) is
29.5 ms compared to 33.1 ms ((cid:1)12%) for the numerical model [44]
and the analytical solution [218].

PVolume-equivalent non-spherical particles also have a faster
temperature response time than their spherical counterparts [220].
For example, in a film cooling study using phosphor particles [20],
the analysis of Wadewitz and Specht [220] was used to evaluate
response time of oblate spheroid BAM:Eu particles with a volume-
equivalent diameter of 2.4 mm. In air at 300 K, the 95% response
times ranged between 99 and 143 ms for aspect ratios between 0.1
(a flat disc-shaped particle) and 1 (a perfect sphere). Although the
response time is likewise faster because of the increased ratio of sur-
face area to volume, obtaining a realistic estimate of the response
time of the ZnO particles used in Refs. [14,15] is more difficult. Fig. 8
indicates that the ZnO particles are agglomerates comprised of
several » 100 nm particles. Therefore, the thermal lag of particles
should be measured in well defined flows. For example, the work
described in Ref. [221] used oblique shocks to determine the velocity
response time of PIV tracer particles in the time domain. A turbulent
jet with well-characterised energy spectrum could also be used as a
test in the frequency domain.

P5.2.2. Velocity response

PFor the velocity response time the particle equation of motion
has to be solved, generally assuming a spherical particle. The
particle Reynolds number Rep 1⁄4 rf Usdp=mf (where U is the veloc-
ity, Us 1⁄4 Up (cid:1) Uf is the slip velocity between the particles and the
fluid, dp is the particle diameter and mf is the dynamic viscosity of
the fluid) is an important governing parameter. In air, water and
many other fluids, Rep is below 1 for slip velocities up to 0.1 m/s
and particles in the mm diameter size range. Then in the viscous
regime, Stokes’ drag law applies and the drag force is
FD 1⁄4 (cid:1)3pmf dpUs. (If the initial slip velocity is very high the drag
force would be larger than that predicted by this expression in
which case the following calculated response times would actually
be overestimated [56]). Then, the equation of motion may be used
in two ways. One, the time-independent slip velocity in a quiescent
fluid, termed the settling velocity Ut 1⁄4 ðrp
; can be
derived. This is useful to determine the lower limit range of veloci-
ties that can be accurately measured. The settling velocity is below
1 mm/s for 2 mm particles in air, and two orders of magnitude
lower in water.

PTwo, the particle response time can be determined. Often the
analysis in the literature imposes a sudden acceleration i.e. a step
change in the fluid velocity to yield a particle velocity response time.
In gases, it can be assumed that rp (cid:4) rf and so terms with rf are

the most important parameter for the tracing ability of phosphor
particles.

PIn air at 293 K a spherical phosphor particle 2 mm in diameter
with a density of 4 g/cm3 has a 95% response time of 150 ms. The
question of flow tracing is the same as for solid particles typically
used as PIV tracers e.g. Al2O3 or TiO2, and for this some analyses use
the frequency of the turbulent velocity fluctuations to determine the
appropriate particle size [56,57]. Generally particles » 2(cid:1)3 mm in
diameter are acceptable to track fluctuations around 1 kHz [56].
Smaller particles are needed for accurate second order statistics in
very turbulent flows or high speed flows with extreme velocity gra-
information the reader is referred to
dients. For further useful
experiments and DNS of PIV particles in turbulent premixed flames
[222] and measurements of the particle response times across
shocks [221].

PIn liquids it can be assumed instead that rp (cid:5) rf, with the only
effect on the response time of Eq. (20) being that the factor is
increased to 1/12. This is of minor significance, as typically the
response times in liquids are very short because of their dynamic
viscosity. That of particles in water, for example, is » 2 orders of
magnitude lower than in air. For a spherical phosphor particle 5 mm
in diameter, also assuming a density of 4 g/cm3, the 3tU (95%)
response time is 25 ms in water at 293 K. The constraints on particle
diameter are considerably relaxed for velocity tracing in liquids.

PTwo things should be noted. First, because as the gas viscosity
increases with temperature, at higher temperatures the response
times significantly improve e.g. dpD 2 mm, rpD 4 g/cm3, 3tUD 67 ms
at 1150 K. (Though less critical, in liquids the decrease in viscosity
with temperature has the opposite effect). Second, normally phos-
phor particles are certainly not perfect spheres, as shown by the
SEM images (Fig. 8). When the fluid accelerates and there is signifi-
cant slip, such particles, especially flat disc-shaped particles e.g. as
for BAM:Eu, will tend to align so the long axis of the particle is per-
pendicular to the flow.
In comparison to a volume-equivalent
sphere, the drag force increases relative to the particle inertia. There-
fore these response times may be considered a conservative esti-
mate of the velocity tracing response.

5.3. Detector related errors

PBesides the contribution to the random error, the detectors may
affect the measurement accuracy due to instability in the detector
offset signal and non-linearity in the detector response to incoming
light.

PDetector offset

PMost detectors exhibit some sort of inherent offset signal, for
example the image recorded by a camera in the absence of inci-
dent light commonly known as the dark image. In theory, this
offset can be subtracted in an ordinary background subtraction
performed before or after a measurement sequence. However, in
a phosphor particle characterisation study using CCD cameras,
offset variations during a recording sequence (especially during
the first frames of a recording) and variations between recording
sequences were observed even after the cameras were turned on
and the chip cooling temperature was stable. It was calculated
that these offset changes would lead to a significant temperature
error at low light levels [13]. Therefore the measurement accu-
racy may be compromised, even when the noise characteristics
of the sensor are suitable for very precise measurements. The
same study proposed a simple dynamic background subtraction
procedure (see Ref. [13] for details), which is especially useful
for accurate temperature measurements or obtaining phosphor
characterisation data (for example performing a parameter varia-
tion) at low light levels. Different instruments must be checked

Pas necessary: for example in an intensity ratio imaging experi-
ment using high-speed CMOS sensors it was found that the offset
was adequately stable if the cameras were powered on for an
extended period of time [19].

PDetector linearity

PSimilarly, detector linearity information may not be available
from the manufacturer, or only specified over a limited range of
operation outside of which the dectector is still useful for precise
measurements. Extending the useful range by means of linearity
characterisation is therefore necessary.

PFor non-intensified cameras, varying the exposure time for a
fixed radiant flux may not be a suitable approach for the evaluation
of camera linearity due to the charge accumulation during the read-
out process as mentioned in Section 3.2.3. The calibrated light source
in integrating sphere systems generally operates continuously, so
that the offset level can only be determined after turning the light
off. Offset fluctuations may occur, which as discussed may cause a
lack of repeatability in the measured linearity response.

PInstead, in Ref. [13], the linearity response of CCD cameras was
determined using an integrating sphere and a light source that was
the luminescence emission of a BAM:Eu2þ phosphor pellet follow-
ing laser excitation at constant pulse energy, which was monitored
with a silicon photodiode. This arrangement covered a suitable range
of irradiance on the chip during the short exposure time used in the
actual measurements, and permitted implementation of
the
dynamic background subtraction procedure described above. This
approach served as a nonlinearity correction, extending the use of
the cameras outside the manufacturers tested operation range and
into a low light regime where the cameras could be used to produce
accurate phosphor characterisation data. As an alternative the linear-
ity can be checked (but not corrected for) without a reference detec-
tor for the photon flux, by confirming that the intensity ratio for a
given phosphor does not change for increasing signal levels. How-
ever, it may be difficult to change the photon flux without affect-
ing the spectral signature of the light. For instance, increasing
the laser fluence on the phosphor, or decreasing the camera
aperture are unsuitable as they may affect the emission spec-
trum of the phosphor or the transmission spectrum of the filters
(via the angular dependence). As an example of a different
method used in this context, Van Lipzig et al. measured the
intensity ratio of suspended BAM:Eu2þ particles using intensified
cameras, while they were settling in a fixed-volume chamber [37],
causing the detected intensity to drop. Thus the linearity could be
checked, but in this case it must be assumed that the particle size
does not affect the emission spectrum.

5.4. Background interference

PAny signal which is not laser-induced luminescence from phos-
phor particles in the probe volume is referred to as the background.
Background signals lead to increased random uncertainty, even
when it is possible to correctly evaluate and subtract the background
signal; or impaired measurement accuracy, if the background cannot
be accurately removed.

PBackground that is not generated by the laser can be of various
natures such as ambient light, flame luminosity or radiation from
hot surfaces. It is proportional to the effective exposure time of the
camera (refer to Section 3.2.3 on effective exposure). The magnitude
of the background and its unsteadiness are easily evaluated by turn-
ing the laser off. In turbulent reactive flows, a fluctuating flame lumi-
nosity may be an issue, as was the case in homogeneous charge
compression ignition (HCCI) [32,33] and Diesel engine [43] studies
using the YAG:Dy3þ phosphor. Near the onset of combustion, meas-
urements were not possible. Therefore careful attention must be
paid to the choice of filters to minimise the overlap with the flame

Pemission spectrum. A reduction in the effective exposure time can
also be obtained using intensified cameras. Naturally, in this situa-
tion, it is essential to use a phosphor with a short lifetime such as
BAM:Eu2þ (1ms) or ZnO ( < 1 ns), to allow short exposures without
loss in signal.

PBackground caused by the laser includes elastic scattering from
particles and surfaces, Raman scattering from liquids, fluorescence
from gaseous species (e.g. fuel, other tracers, radical species, photo-
dissociated fragments etc), from walls and windows, and finally
luminescence from particles deposited on surfaces. Elastic scattering
can be removed using filters with appropriate optical density. The
other sources of background can be evaluated by removing particles
from the flow, which in some cases is difficult, for example in large
liquid tanks, but otherwise just requires stopping seeding the
stream. In several IC engine studies using phosphors, various fast
( < 100 ns) fluorescence sources were potentially avoided by delay-
ing the ICCD camera exposure after the laser pulse [31(cid:1)33,43,47].
This is a useful feature of the persistent luminescence of thermo-
graphic phosphors. However for this approach to be effective it is
necessary that the lifetime is long enough at the temperature of
interest to have sufficient integrated signal for the measurement if
the exposure is delayed. In the in-cylinder measurements of Ref.
[47], where a glass piston was used for imaging and windows in the
liner for laser excitation, it was found that later than 30 crank angle
degrees before top dead centre, the window luminescence caused
by the proximity to the laser sheet would be unacceptable, restrict-
ing the measurement to earlier times. It was reported that lumines-
cence from fused silica interfered significantly less with the
measurements than that from sapphire, but still that the signal per-
sisted for 10’s ms. Delayed camera gating cannot remove the lumi-
nescence in this case. Phosphors that can be excited using 355 nm
are preferred because this should strongly reduce such sources of
interference. On the other hand, in liquids Raman scattering may be
an issue. In Ref. [15] it was found that Raman scattered 355 nm exci-
tation light, corresponding to the water O-H stretch, overlaps the
emission spectrum of the ZnO phosphor used for water temperature
imaging. The sub-ns lifetime of ZnO prevented time gating the cam-
era exposure. Instead the excitation wavelength was changed to
266 nm, thereby shifting the interfering Raman signal away from the
luminescence emission band.

PMethods based on the decay time are relatively insensitive to
background interferences if the background does not change during
the evaluation time window of the decay time, or the laser-induced
background is very short-lived compared to the decay time. In these
cases, they can be discriminated against by subtraction of a back-
ground determined from data (CMOS frames, PMT signal) prior to
the laser pulse, and/or by the decay time fitting procedure.

PWhen particles deposit in high concentrations on windows and
walls, they may be excited either directly or via scattered laser light,
which can produce very high luminescence signals because the
number density of particles is much higher than that in the fluid
adjacent to the surface. The point is that this signal cannot be filtered
either temporally or spectrally. This is a significant problem for two-
colour imaging (but can be moderated using some kind of structured
laser illumination, see below), and lifetime measurements because
the measured temperature has contribution from both wall and fluid
temperature. The wall contribution changes in the course of particle
deposition i.e. in time.

PIn Ref. [20], the aim was to measure mixing between a film cool-
ing flow and a main flow above a surface using BAM:Eu2þ particles.
It was found that when the laser was propagated perpendicular to
that surface and impinged upon it (see Fig. 32), signals originating
from particle deposited on the test plate prevented measurements
as far as 8 mm from the surface. Note that the light was so bright
that simply positioning the camera to remove the offending surface
(s) from the field of view was ineffective, and that multiple

stream of an inclined effusion cooling hole. The laser sheet propagates downward,
perpendicular to the test plate surface. The white regions in false colour indicate
where the camera was saturated.

Pscattering of strong surface emissions by particles in the flow can be
significant too (see also Ref. [18]).

PThe same particle deposition and subsequent background signal
interference problems were reported in a study of liquid fuel injec-
tion in a hot air cross-flow using YVO4:Eu3þ particles [172]. This
study tried different wall surface treatments with limited success,
and also noted that discontinuities on the surface e.g. joints, steps
lead to increased deposition, presumably due to local flow recircula-
tion. Interfering particle deposition was also reported in IC engines
using YAG:Dy3þ particles, which was apparently reduced using an
SiO2 nanoparticle coating (see Section 6.3) [43].

PWhere possible it is much better to avoid exciting deposited par-
ticles. For these reasons, in the above-mentioned film cooling study,
the laser beam was propagated parallel to the surface (using a peri-
scope arrangment positioned downstream in the flow, see Fig. 59 in
Section 6.4) [20]. This resulted in orders of magnitude lower excita-
tion fluence for the deposited particles, allowing interference-free
temperature measurements to within 3 mm above the surface.

PAs stated previously, particles deposit on the surface over time
and so surface contributions are by nature transient. Therefore sub-
tracting the background taken after the measurements once the
measurements are finished may be associated with large uncer-
tainty. Deposition is a limiting factor for the duration of the meas-
urements (not to mention the ease with which particle seeding can
be turned on or off, or surfaces flushed/cleaned), so that in some
cases, at low repetition rates, only a few temperature fields can be
measured, which ultimately offers poor statistical convergence. In
this respect, high-speed measurements (e.g. [19,20]) are extremely
valuable, providing thousands of images during a second, and accu-
mulation of a large amount of statistics before deposition becomes a
problem. The thermographic LDV probe is also very useful in this
regard, since the continuous background from the particles depos-
ited on surfaces and excited by the cw laser can be distinguished
from the short (» 10’s ms) luminescence burst when a particle tra-
verses the probe volume [21].

PIn general, methods to reduce or eliminate particle deposition in
the first place, or prevent them from emitting luminescence once
deposited, would be immensely useful. Otherwise, “structured laser
illumination planar imaging” (SLIPI) [223] can be used for the evalu-
ation and removal of the surface luminescence. The general principle
of structured illumination is to impart some spatially-modulated
structure to the laser light sheet. Several sub-images are recorded in
which the spatial phase is shifted, either on an average or single-
shot basis. Signal (particle luminescence in this case) originating
from the measurement plane preserves the spatial modulation,
whereas mutiply scattered light does not. The image that is recon-
structed from subtraction of sub images with one another thereby
recovers the signal of interest.

PA two-phase time-averaged approach was used to deal with both
the effects of surface luminescence and multiple scattering in a jet in
coflow configuration [18]. In the study, the modulated laser sheet
intentionally impinged on the nozzle which was partially covered

tional (a) and SLIPI reconstruction (b) in the center plane of a jet-coflow configuration.

samples. The laser enters the flow from the left hand side and deliberately impinges

Pwith deposited BAM:Eu particles, causing a large signal adjacent to
the nozzle (see Fig. 33 a). In the processed intensity images, the SLIPI
reconstruction seemed to considerably reduce the signal close to the
surface, as shown on Fig 33 b. However, in other experiments in the
same configuration, large errors in the recovered temperature field
persisted up to 5 mm from the nozzle. More details of this approach
are discussed below (Section 5.5) in the context of multiple scatter-
ing between particles. Note that due to the transient nature of the
particle deposition, only single shot SLIPI approach [224] with two
or three laser pulses appears as a suitable option.

5.5. Seeding density effects

PIn this section, we explore sources of error which may originate
from inhomogenities in the seeding density and from optical inter-
actions between particles, such as multiple scattering and self
absorption. Considering a planar imaging configuration, lumines-
cence from particles in the beam path can be scattered by particles
located in front or behind the measurement plane towards the dec-
tector as shown in Fig. 34. Alternatively, the excitation light can be
scattered by the particles in the beam path, which then excite par-
ticles in front or behind the measurement plane, and the subsequent
luminescence emission is also imaged by the detector. Both scenar-
ios result in luminescence signal which does not originate from par-
In the following we review
ticles in the measurement plane.

jet surrounded by a seeded coflow. The solid arrow indicates a possible optical path
which leads, by multiple scattering, to the imaging of luminescence from the coflow

Pexperiments designed to reveal these issues and ways to deal with it.
Van Lipzig et al. made measurements inside a 10 cm £ 10 cm reac-
tion pressure vessel [37]. A slot was used to define the laser light
sheet vertically and the vertical profile of the resulting particle lumi-
nescence was analysed. This profile appearing broader than the slit
width, the authors concluded there was a multiple scattering effect.
While it is likely that there was a contribution from multiple scatter-
in view of the high seeding density
ing in their experiment,
(6 £ 1011 particles/m3), without imaging the laser profile in the
absence of particles (using e.g. a dye cell), it is difficult to separate
the contribution of multiple scattering to the light sheet broadening
from that caused by optical elements and/or diffraction.

PMore obvious evidence of this phenomenon can be found in an
unseeded jet surrounded by a seeded coflow, as shown in Fig. 34.
When the seeding density is increased in the coflow, some lumines-
cence signal may appear in locations that correspond to the
unseeded jet. The extent of this multiple scattering phenomenon
depends on the emission intensity (per particle) of the phosphor
particles in the coflow, the scattering cross-section of the phosphor
particles, the extent of the seeded coflow, and the number density of
particles. In Lee et al., evidence of this was reported for a central jet
and coflow of 16 and 140 mm diameter respectively [16]. As shown
in Fig. 35, for a seeding density of 4 £ 1010 particles/m3 of 2 mm
BAM:Eu2þ particles seeded in the coflow (as measured by the
authors using a similar approach to the method described in Sec-
tion 4), the signal in the unseeded central jet corresponds to 8% of
the signal in the coflow.

PThe consequence is that if the same phosphor particles were also
seeded in the central jet to image the temperature in both streams,
the signal from the central jet would contain a contribution from the
particles in the coflow. Were the temperature between both streams
different, the detected signal in the central jet, for example its
spectral content (intensity ratio), may be biased toward that of the
coflow.

PThe scaling of this contribution with the seeding density is
needed to predict or assess the error in a specific configuration. If
extinction of either laser light or particle luminescence is neglected,
it can be assumed that the light emitted from particles in the mea-
surement plane (defined by the laser sheet) scales linearly with
the seeding density, which agrees with experimental observation
described in Section 4. The probability that this luminescence light is
re-scattered by a particle also scales linearly with the seeding den-
sity (also in the absence of extinction) so that one might expect that,
overall, the light which is multiply-scattered scales with the square
of the seeding density.

Fig. 36. Luminescence intensity measured in 10 mm diameter unseeded nitrogen jet
as a function of the seeding density of BAM:Eu2þ particles in a surrounding 80 mm
diameter coflow. A power law fit is also shown. Data from the authors.

PTo explore this phenomenon further, in Fig. 36, we present our
own findings of an experiment in a similar configuration (unseeded
central jet, seeded coflow) with the same phosphor particles (2 mm
BAM:Eu2þ) but with a different geometry: the diameters of the cen-
tral jet and the coflow were 10 mm and 80 mm respectively. As in
Ref. [16], a luminescence signal was recorded in the central jet, and
the signal increases with the seeding density, but the dependence is
less than quadratic. Also, in this case, for the intensity in the central
jet to be 8% of that in the coflow, we calculate that the coflow seed-
ing density has to be 2 £ 1012 particles/m3, which is considerably
higher than in the Lee study [16]. While the geometry accounts for
some of the difference (here a smaller coflow diameter is used), it is
possible that differences in the particle counting method is the rea-
son for this discrepancy.

PThe following reviews investigations aimed at determining the
impact of this effect on intensity ratio imaging. In Ref. [16], to
limit the error, the authors proposed maintaining a lower seeding
density in the coflow than in a central jet, and observed that for a
ratio Rsd
c (with nj and nc being the seeding densities in the jet
and coflow respectively) greater than 0.5 £ 10(cid:1)10 m3/particles, the
intensity ratio measured in the central jet (at 615 K) is only a weak
function of seeding density, as shown in Fig. 37 (7.5% change up to
4 £ 10(cid:1)10 m3/particles as estimated from the equation displayed on
the figure).

PFrom these results, several matters may be expanded upon. For a
fixed level of multiply scattered light, the bias in the measured inten-
sity ratio depends on the intensity of the “direct” luminescence from
the imaged particles relative to that multiply scattered light. As the
temperature of the heated jet is increased, the luminescence intensity
per particle drops due to thermal quenching, so for a fixed seeding
density ratio, the contribution from multiple scattering will increase.
In that work, the intensity ratio was calibrated as a function of tem-
perature in the flow and for seeding densities fullfilling the criterium
above (Rsd > 0.5 £ 10(cid:1)10 m3/particles), which includes a contribution
from multiple scattering. This approach incurs a slight reduction in the
temperature sensitivity and the seeding densities must be kept in the
same range for calibration and measurements [16].

PAn in-situ calibration approach was also used for the film cooling
study described in Ref. [20], where it was noted that, since the meas-
urements were performed at 6 kHz, it was possible to maintain a
constant particle number density during the 3 s measurement
sequences, and between different measurement sequences. Then, as
in the Lee study, the in-situ calibration would have in effect compen-
sated for a possible influence of the multiple scattering of lumines-
cence emitted by particles at the main flow temperature on the
intensity ratio measured in the jet core. A similar film cooling study
using the same phosphor particles observed that the effects of multi-
ple scattering caused the measured jet temperatures to depend on
the seeding density, and that this is a particular problem when there
is a large difference in the volume of two seeded streams [225].
Inhomogeneities in the seeding density may mean that locally the
contribution from multiple scattering is higher. To prevent this, in
Ref. [16], areas of the central jet which did not fullfill the criteria of
sufficient seeding density (based on Mie scattering images) were
removed from the measurement. In jet in coflow experiments where
the seeding density in the central jet and coflow are different, due to
mixing in the shear layer the seeding density decreases with dis-
tance from the jet centreline, and the seeding density ratio criteria is
no longer fullfilled. This applies to all experiments with two or more
seeded streams. However, the effect of mixing on the seeding den-
sity, and therefore on the relative signal contribution, will be convo-
luted with the temperature dependence of
the luminescence
intensity per particle. This should be considered when addressing
the impact of multiple scattering.

PThe potential of structured laser illumination (see description of
the principle in Section 5.4) to eliminate multiply scattered light in
the seeded gas phase was explored in some detail by Zentgraf et al.
[18]. The same jet in coflow configuration as described above in the
Lee study was used. In this study a direct comparison between con-
ventional imaging and the two-phase SLIPI technique was con-
ducted. There, the same two subsets of data shifted by half a spatial
period were exploited, i.e. addition was performed to reproduce con-
ventional
imaging, and a subtraction was used for the SLIPI
approach. In this case a single pulse laser was used to excite the
particles and therefore the sub-image datasets were separately
recorded in time by shifting the grating used to impart the structure
to the light sheet. However, since the magnitude of the multiple
scattering depends on the number of particles, some conditioning
had to be applied to extract time-average sub-images for a roughly
constant seeding density. This conditioning used a simple filtering
applied to the luminescence images to provide an “apparent” parti-
cle number density.

PThe temperature of the central jet was varied, and calibration
curves obtained by both approaches were compared for various lev-
els of seeding. As expected, the sensitivity of the technique in the
conventional approach is degraded as the coflow seeding density
increases because the jet signal is increasingly corrupted by multiply
scattered light. On the other hand, calibration curves from the SLIPI
subtraction were almost independent of the seeding density i.e. the
seeding density ratio criteria described previously for the Lee et al.

Pstudy [16] may be relaxed. Because of the sinusoidally-modulated
light sheets used in SLIPI, two conditions must be met in order to
completely remove multiply scattered light. First is that the signal
intensity scales linearly with the excitation intensity, and second
that there is no cross-dependency of the intensity ratio on the laser
fluence. In view of the findings of Section 4.4.4. regarding the phos-
phors ZnO and BAM:Eu2+, the validity of those two assumptions has
to be carefully considered or additional uncertainty in the applica-
tion of structured illumination may arise.

PThe investigation using structured illumination also allowed
quantification of the contribution of multiple scattering in the
seeded coflow itself by comparing the detected signal of the conven-
tional and SLIPI approaches. Images of mean luminescence intensity
for the two processing routes are shown in Fig. 33. The contribution
of multiple scattering is assessed in two areas denoted 4 and 5 in
Fig. 33. In area 5, the contribution of multiple scattering amounts to
about 70% of the signal for the seeding conditions of the experiment,
while in area 4, which should be free from contribution from surface
luminescence, the contribution is still 40%. In this case the source of
this light and therefore its spectral content is unclear, which compli-
cates the uncertainty analysis. In both regions, the contributions
were found to increase with the seeding level. Note that the magni-
tude of the “apparent” seeding density evaluated here from lumines-
cence images may differ significantly with respect to that measured
using a high-resolution counting method such as that of Ref. [44]
(see also Section 4.3.2).

PTo retain the advantages of single-shot thermometry, clearly a
single shot SLIPI approach [224] with two or three laser pulses is
preferred. However the Zentgraf study rightly emphasises that even
to recover average temperature fields, due to both the fact that the
seeding density surely varies in time, and the particle deposition is
by nature transient (discussed in the previous section), any realistic
integration of SLIPI with planar phosphor thermometry really
demands an instantaneous approach. In the Zentgraf study prelimi-
nary measurements using a second laser to achieve single-shot two-
phase SLIPI are also shown.

PMultiple scattering could also decrease the spatial resolution of
the measurement, by broadening the light sheet or blurring the
images of particles in the measurement plane. To quantify this effect
we imaged a USAF 1951 resolution test chart through a 5 cm thick
rectangular jet seeded with ZnO particles. For a very high seeding
density of 8 £ 1012 particles/m3 it was found that although the light
was attenuated by » 50%, the modulation of line pairs at a frequency
of 3.17 pairs/mm was maintained at a satisfactory level of 50% , com-
pared to 60% without particles in the flow. A loss of spatial resolution
from imaging through clouds of particles or from broadening of the
light sheet therefore appears unlikely. Instead, as discussed above, it
would appear that the potential effects of multiple scattering are
manifested as a “background” contribution.

PFinally, if the excitation and emission spectra of the phosphor
particles overlap, re-absorption of luminescence can occur, and the
detected spectrum may be dependent on the number density and
the optical path through the seeded flow of interest since part of the
spectrum will be more absorbed. In addition, the Mie scattering
cross section is, albeit weakly, wavelength-dependent, and for par-
ticles with a broad emission spectrum, elastic scattering can poten-
tially alter the spectrum of the collected light. For both BAM:Eu2þ
and ZnO, there is an overlap in excitation and emission spectrum as
shown in Fig. 4. To investigate possible effects, an isothermal jet of
air 40 mm in diameter was seeded with BAM:Eu2þ particles, and the
intensity ratio of particles in the mid-plane was measured while
changing the seeding density. Over
the range tested (from
0.5(cid:1)2.5 £ 1011 particles/m3) no changes were observed [13]. A simi-
lar experiment was repeated for ZnO in a 20 mm diameter jet, and
over the range tested (up to 6 £ 1011 particles/m3), no changes were
observed either. The same ZnO particles were investigated in water

P(again in the midplane of a volume 20 mm deep) with mass loads cor-
responding to 2.5 £ 1012 particles/m3, with the same result [15]. The
Lee study tested this effect in a 16 mm central jet seeded with BAM:
Eu2þ particles and a 140 mm coflow which was seeded either with
BAM:Eu2þ or non-luminescent MgO particles [16]. The study was
interesting because the jet was heated to 610 K. Because the emission
spectrum shifts toward the UV with increasing temperature, there is
more overlap between the 610 K emission spectrum and the room
temperature excitation spectrum. A difference of 5(cid:1)10% in the jet
intensity ratio for coflow BAM:Eu2þ particle number densities up to
1011 particles/m3 was observed. However, the authors acknowledge
multiple scattering could also be responsible for this, and, despite the
thresholding on Rsd that was applied, it is not possible to be conclusive
about self-absorption at this higher temperature. YAG:Dy3þ;Er3þ par-
ticles were tested in the same manner at room temperature, in the
midplane of a 37 mm volume, and no changes were observed between
1 and 2 £ 1011 particles/m3 [186].

PTo summarise, for all experiments careful assessment and man-
agement of multiple scattering effects are absolutely necessary,
which are acute in particular geometries. The temperature range,
seeding densities and temperature dependence of the signal per
particle all play a role. Our view is that agreement in the counting
methods used must be established to ensure the results of the
experiments described here are transferable. As it stands, structured
laser illumination on a single-shot basis appears a viable means to
remove the multiple scattering contribution. The impact very likely
depends on the phosphor, therefore, the same experiments must
also be repeated for other phosphors, noting too that the relative
importance of absorption and scattering depends on the particle size
and shape. ZnO must therefore be tested as SEM images show a very
different morphology compared to BAM:Eu2þ (see Section 2.3).

5.6. Laser fluence effects

PIn this section, potential errors which may arise from the non-
linear dependence of the luminescence intensity on the excitation
fluence (saturation) and from the undesirable dependence of the
measured luminescence property (intensity ratio, lifetime, phase-
shift) on the excitation fluence are analysed. These errors are evalu-
ated in the context of phosphors known to exhibit these phenomena,
and the examples are drawn from measurements using the ratio-
imaging approach. However the general concepts are broadly appli-
cable, and may prompt studies of other phosphor particles used in
other thermometry configurations as required.

PAs discussed in Section 4, it was observed for two phosphors
(ZnO and BAM:Eu2þ) tested in the gas phase, that the luminescence
intensity is not proportional to the laser fluence. A sublinear depen-
dence, characteristic of saturation effects, starts at fluences as low as
10 mJ/cm2. In an imaging experiment, due to the limited signal level,
it is desirable to operate in the non-linear regime. The consequence
is that for a light sheet with a Gaussian spatial intensity distribution,
the contribution of low fluence regions at the side of the light sheet
to the total luminescence signal increases relative to a linear regime
case. This effectively decreases the spatial resolution of the measure-
ment in the out of plane direction. To quantify this effect, a profile of
luminescence signal in the out-of-plane direction can be simulated
based on laser sheet measurements and the saturation data of the
phosphor. In Ref. [20], for a Gaussian light sheet with a mean fluence
of 17 mJ/cm2, only just inside the saturation regime of the phosphor
BAM:Eu2þ used, it was found that because of this effect the effective
FWHM of the light sheet increased from 900 mm to 1 mm. Operating
further into the saturation regime effectively broadens the light
sheet. As pointed out in Ref. [16], a beam homogeniser can be used
to transform the Gaussian beam profile into a top-hat in the out-of-
plane direction, permitting operation at higher fluence without spa-
tial broadening of the probe volume.

PSection 4 has also identified that at low fluences there is a depen-
dence of the intensity ratio on the laser fluence for the same two
phosphors. Above a certain fluence threshold (» 50 and » 120 mJ/
cm2 for ZnO and BAM respectively), the intensity ratio was no longer
sensitive to the laser fluence and it may seem attractive to operate
in that regime. However, the probe volume would be significantly
larger than expected for a Gaussian beam, as described above. Also,
it is often not possible to reach such high fluences, e.g. if the field of
view is large, or for measurements at kHz rates, where normally
only a few mJ can be delivered by high-speed lasers.

PTherefore in normal cases, one can anticipate that the laser flu-
ence may not be uniform over the entire measurement volume. For
reference, when unaccounted for, a 10% change in the fluence corre-
sponds to a 2 K error at 20 mJ/cm2 for BAM:Eu2þ [13], and a 6 K error
at 5 mJ/cm2 for ZnO [14] around room temperature. There are vari-
ous origins for the variation in the laser fluence:

P(cid:3) Steady spatial variations induced by the laser profile and optics

used to define the probe volume e.g. a light sheet,

P(cid:3) Fluctuations in the excitation energy e.g. pulse to pulse variation

in the overall laser pulse energy,

P(cid:3) Temporal variation in the excitation spatial profile,
P(cid:3) Variations of the excitation fluence of particles located at differ-
ent positions in the probe volume where there is no measure of
particle position e.g. in the out of plane direction within the laser
sheet in an imaging experiment.

PThe first type of variation can in principle be included in the
white field correction (as described in Section 3.3.4), by dividing the
intensity ratio (or decay time) image by an average intensity ratio
(or decay time) image obtained at room temperature where the tem-
perature is uniform. This correction is expressed by Eq. 9 which
assumes that the relative change of the intensity ratio with excita-
tion laser fluence is independent of temperature. The validity of this
assumption was explored for intensity ratio imaging with ZnO
[14,185]. As shown in Fig. 38, the maximum deviation between
normalised calibration curves obtained at 5 mJ/cm2 and 20 mJ/cm2
is 7.2 K at 470 K. In the two-colour ratio imaging experiments of
Ref. [14], the light sheet optics formed a sheet that was diverging
across the field of view corresponding to fluence variations of 50 and
5% in the horizontal (beam focusing towards its waist) and vertical
(diverging) directions. This led to errors of 2.2 and 0.2 K respectively.
Since a much larger span of laser fluences (20(cid:1)213 mJ/cm2) was
used in the study of Fan et al., instead a cuvette of fluorescent dye
was used to determine the fluence distribution in only one direction,
and thereby establish a final calibration function that depended on
the laser fluence and temperature [185]. It must be noted that a sep-
arate white field correction should still be applied. For BAM:Eu2þ;
as shown in Fig. 39, the normalised change in the ratio from 9 to
40 mJ/cm2 is slightly different between 295 K and 615 K,

Pcase offers in principle an extended region at uniform and steady
temperature. This prevents temporal and spatial averaging error of
the intensity ratio or lifetime, which may not have a linear relation-
ship with temperature.

PThe reference temperature must be determined from indepen-
dent physical probes e.g. thermocouples, or another optical method,
e.g. CARS thermometer (although there has not been any report of
another optical technique being used to determine the reference
temperature for phosphor thermometry in fluids). One obvious
source of error is the uncertainty in this independent reference tem-
perature measurement. Intrusive probes such as thermocouple or
micro-thermistors have high accuracy (a few K or less) in the deter-
mination of the temperature of the sensing element (junction or
micro-thermistor), which is well documented in the literature. How-
ever two types of error can be much more significant when measur-
ing fluid temperatures with such probes, especially gases at high
temperatures. First, the probe may be at a different temperature
than the fluid, due to heat transfer to or from the sensing element to
the probe and surroundings. Second, the presence of the probe may
change the temperature of the fluid, either via heat transfer, or
through catalytic reactions.

PHeat transfer related errors of intrusive thermometers are a well
known limitation of this type of sensor [228]. The deviation from the
fluid temperature may strongly depend on the probe geometry
(exposed junction, insulated, wire/bead diameter and length, nature
of support), the probe material (thermal conductivity, emissivity),
and the probe surroundings (flow parameters, immersion length
into the isothermal region of the flow). For accurate measurements,
it is essential to quantify possible errors due to heat transfer. Fortu-
nately often these factors upon which the temperature error
depends are simplified, e.g. for very thin probes fully immersed in
the fluid. The heat transfer consists of radiation from the wire/sheath
(noting that calculating the radiation error considering the junction
alone is not appropriate); convection to and from the wire and
sheath (noting that if the jet is surrounded by a coflow, additional
convection losses between the sheath/wires and the coflow must
also be accounted for) and conduction along the length of the probe.
PFor example, larger probes e.g. the 500 mm diameter thermocou-
ples used in Refs. [16,44] are attractive options since they are rather
rigid, and for the intermediate temperatures (up to » 700 K) of those
studies an error of just a few K is estimated. In comparison, the study
in Ref. [13] was performed at significantly higher temperatures
(» 900 K) and a smaller 3 mm immersion depth in the jet. The error
with a 500 mm diameter probe would be much higher in this case,
due to increased radiation and conduction away from the junction. A
50 mm probe was used instead, which was supported with a ceramic
tube.

PCatalytic reactions on the thermocouple surface have also been
observed in reducing environments, especially in pre-flame regions
of premixed flames [229,230], which results in a probe temperature
higher than that of the fluid without the probe due to exothermic
recombination reactions. In our laboratory we observed such effects
in lean premixed hydrogen-air flames, which could potentially be a
test case for calibration at intermediate temperatures. Long after the
flame blew off and no heat release was observed, the measured ther-
mocouple temperature would still indicate above 700 K. In addition,
the indicated temperature would increase with the equivalence
ratio. Non-catalytic coatings are available (see studies mentioned
above), but they also increase the size of the bead and/or wire, which
leads to higher heat transfer errors.

POf course, careful consideration of the reference temperature mea-
surement error also applies to calibrations performed on aggregated
powder or phosphor coatings in a furnace, oven, heated plate etc. On
the one hand it should be a relatively simpler task to obtain an accu-
rate reference temperature. On the other hand however, it should be
noted that since this calibration method may be inherently inaccurate

Eu2þ particles at temperatures 295 K and 615 K. Reproduced from Ref. [16] with per-
mission from Springer.

Ptranslating into a deviation of 12.5 K in the normalised calibra-
tion curves. At a flow temperature of 615 K, a 50% change in flu-
ence around 15 mJ/cm2 would lead to an error of 3.2 K. This
shows that in practical situations fixed spatial variations in exci-
tation fluence can generally be corrected for, and that the resid-
ual error is rather small.

PTemporal variations in excitation fluence can be corrected by
measuring e.g. the laser pulse energy on a shot to shot basis, using
an energy meter, or a photodiode, as applied in Ref. [14].

PCorrecting for temporal variation in the excitation spatial profile
would require recording this e.g. by simultaneously imaging a
cuvette filled with a dye solution. Also when a vertical strip of the
image is at known temperature, e.g. a turbulent jet and a coflow,
frame referencing can be used, a procedure sometimes employed for
Rayleigh imaging, see e.g. Refs. [226,227]. Temporal variations in the
excitation fluence distribution can also be caused by refractive index
inhomogeneities in the fluid itself, or strong lensing effects by drop-
lets, menisci and so forth. Laser sheet “striping” effects are well
known difficulties in liquids with strongly non-uniform temperature
fields. Phosphors as temperature-sensitive as ZnO, but without any
dependence of the emission spectrum on the laser fluence are
needed.

PIf the laser beam is Gaussian, a particle will be illuminated by a
different fluence depending on its position within the probe vol-
ume e.g. the depth position (z) within a laser light sheet in an
imaging experiment. While the particle position in the image plane
(x, y) is known, the z position is not. While dividing by an average
ratio image (or decay time image) acquired at room temperature
(see above) corrects for the systematic error, it does not correct for
the unknown particle z position. However, at relevant seeding den-
sities (e.g. 1011 particles/m3) and depending on the spatial resolu-
tion and laser sheet thickness (e.g. 600 mm for both), statistically
there are many particles (» 50) in each independent probe volume
and so this potential contribution to the single-shot is considered
negligible.

5.7. Calibration accuracy

PThe temperature dependence of the measured quantity (intensity
ratio or lifetime) must be established. For the reasons discussed in
Section 3.4, this is preferably determined from dispersed particles at
various reference temperatures, for example, in-situ. It is necessary
to add phosphor to the fluid and control the fluid temperature,
which is relatively easy in liquids. A standard approach in gases is to
seed phosphor in a stream which is electrically heated and issues
from a tube into the ambient. The potential core of the jet in this

P(see Section 3.4), some validation data in the flow is required. The dis-
cussion above also applies when independent thermocouple measure-
ments of flow temperatures are used to validate the data.

PAs with other techniques which require calibration, the quality of
the fit, the number of datapoints, and the uncertainty of those points
determine the statistical uncertainty of the calibration function. Cali-
bration points beyond the temperature range measured in the actual
experiment are also preferred, to avoid bias caused by noisy data
around the minimum and maximum calibrated temperatures in the
experiment. In general, maximum or mean deviation from the fit are
reported, but this does not take into account the number of data-
points.

PFinally, another source of calibration error may stem from the
white field correction. For the intensity ratio approach, as discussed
in Section 3.3.4, a white field correction is necessary, which is gener-
ally performed using a ratio image obtained either in an isothermal
flow or using a phosphor pellet behind a diffusive screen. It was
observed that performing the correction with a light source with a
different emission spectrum, e.g. a LED light source does not neces-
sarily correct an isothermal intensity ratio image, because the spatial
variation in the spectral transmission function may have a different
effect on the intensity ratio between the two channels for each light
source [44]. For BAM:Eu2þ; an LED light source would overestimate
the angular dependency due to its sharper spectral features. In prin-
ciple then, as the emission spectrum of the phosphor changes with
temperature, the terms a and b of Eq. (9) may not be independent,
and a white field correction must be recorded at various tempera-
tures. In other words, a different temperature calibration must be
applied to each pixel. However, for BAM:Eu2þ; the gradients in the
emission spectrum (shown in Fig. 7) are small and do not vary signif-
icantly with temperature, so a white field correction performed at
room temperature satisfactorily corrected the actual non-isothermal
measurements [44]. This effect may require quantification for some
combinations of phosphor and imaging configuration, especially
where the collection angles are steep.

5.8. Intrusive character of the technique

PAlthough laser diagnostics are by their nature non-intrusive in
comparison with bulky physical probes, they may under certain con-
ditions modify the system of interest. For example, the need for opti-
cal access may require altering the system boundaries, and the laser
may deposit energy on the walls, dissociate reactive molecules, or
deposit energy in the fluid via absorbing species or particles etc.
Besides these very general considerations, for this technique solid
particles are required, as often used for LDV or PIV. The particles may
change the physical properties of the fluid, deposit on walls thereby
affecting boundary conditions e.g. heat transfer or the dimensions of
confined environments, or damage components especially moving
parts, such as piston rings or valves. For example a loss of cylinder
sealing caused by a few hours of seeding YAG:Dy3þ particles was
observed in an IC engine study [32]. For the sake of completeness, in
specific reactive environments catalytic effects may be a consideration
(but are unlikely because, like normal PIV tracers, thermographic phos-
phor particles are relatively inert materials), or particles may locally
quench the flame by chain termination reaction at the surface. Here,
various effects of the particles on the fluid are considered.

PThe heat capacity is the most straightforward to address. Adding
particles adds mass to the system, so for the same heat release, e.g.
by chemical reaction, the final fluid temperature may decrease. The
presence of the particles acts to increase the volumetric heat capac-
ity of the fluid. Hasegawa et al., for example, reported that the tem-
perature of the in-cylinder gas was decreased by 2% when seeding
YAG:Dy3þ particles into an IC engine [31], presumably at a very high
particle concentration.

PThe relative change in the volumetric heat capacity of the fluid

can be described by:

with r being the density, c the specific heat capacity, Np the number
density of particles (particles/m3), dp the volume-equivalent diame-
ter of the particle. The subscripts f and p designate the gas and parti-
cle properties respectively. This calculation requires the specific
heat capacity (i.e. heat capacity per unit mass) of the phosphor par-
ticles. Using differential scanning calorimetry, we measured the spe-
cific heat capacity of BAM:Eu2þ powder (KEMK63/UP-P2, Phosphor
Technology UK) as 720 J/kg ¢ K at 293 K. Note that since the specific
heat capacity per unit mass of the gas and particles are similar, the
specific heat capacity as calculated in Ref. [37] does not change, and
is not the right measure for this effect. For 2 mm BAM:Eu2þ particles,
the increase in the volumetric heat capacity for a seeding density of
2 £ 1011 particles/m3 is 0.2% in air at 300 K, and 0.5% at 1100 K
[13,51]. While this shows that for moderate seeding densities, the
particles have negligible effects on the volumetric heat capacity,
there is an obvious limit to seeding many orders of magnitude more
particles to compensate for using an inefficient phosphor for exam-
ple, or to offset the loss of signal with increasing temperature.

PThe transport properties of the fluid (thermal conductivity,
viscosity, and diffusion coefficients) can also be potentially influ-
enced by the presence of particles at high seeding levels. However,
as an example, based on particle-fluid thermal conductivity calcula-
tions proposed by Maxwell
[231] at a seeding density of
2 £ 1011 particles/m3, the particles have no effect on the thermal
conductivity of the gas due to the very little volume fraction
( » 10

(cid:1)6) they occupy in the fluid [51].

PAnother possible effect may be radiation losses from particles,
which could contribute to a decrease in the fluid temperature. While
radiation from the particles were shown to cause only a very small
difference between the particle and the fluid, even at 2000 K and
considering a pure black body emitter (eD1) (see Section 5.2 and
Ref. [44]), the particles can potentially remove energy from the fluid.
To quantify this effect, a particle in an insulated volume of fluid the
size of the inverse of the seeding density was considered. At 1900 K,
and for 1011 particles/m3, the rate of cooling is 4 K per ms. This effect
should be considered in burners with slow hot recirculation zones.
The combined impact of radiative heat loss and gas-particle heat
conduction on the extinction limits of more heavily-seeded pre-
mixed flames are analytically examined in Ref. [232].

6. Applications

6.1. Measurements in liquids

PTemperature measurements at the liquid-gas interface in a vertical
falling film absorber

PThis test-case studied the absorption process in an absorption
chiller, often used for cooling where electricity is expensive or if
there is a source of waste heat. In such device, the refrigerant is
absorbed in a solvent, pumped and later boiled as an alternative to
the vapor compression of the basic refrigeration cycle.

PIn a falling film absorber a lithium bromide brine solvent forms a
film falling down a tube into which water vapour (the refrigerant) is
absorbed. The absorption process releases heat at the liquid-vapour
interface, but if the temperature of the film increases, so does the
saturation pressure, with a negative impact on the rate of absorption
of the vapour in the film. A flow of coolant on the inside of the tube
is used to cool the film, as shown for example in the vertical configu-
ration of Fig. 40, with the aim of maintaining the brine in a subcooled
state and maximising the mass of absorbed refrigerant. Advancing

sion from Elsevier.

Pthe understanding of this complex heat and mass transfer problem is
key to improving the capacity of the chiller. Phosphors were first
used to measure the temperature at the water-liquid interface along
the length of a vertical tube [24,234]. The device consisted of a 1.5 m
stainless-steel tube over which the solvent, aqueous lithium bro-
mide, fell as a film, with a coolant flowing in the opposite direction
on the inside. The tube was mounted in a glass tube, which was filled
with water vapour from the boiler and maintained at a pressure of
1.3 kPa. La2O2S:Eu3þ particles (5(cid:1)10 mm in diameter) were added to
the solvent, which was circulated in a loop formed of the absorber
column, the boiler and a pump.

PThe hydrodynamics of the falling film were such that rolling
waves were formed, and that on average the film was 100 mm thick.
The sweeping action of the rolling waves was supposed to keep the
phosphor particles at the interface. The particles were illuminated
by a nitrogen laser (337 nm, 20 ns pulse) over a 6 mm diameter
region, and the luminescence of the 5D2 line at 514 nm was detected
with a photomultiplier tube. The lifetime of this line is short
(» 4 ms) and has a high temperature sensitivity ( > 3%/K) over the
temperature range of this study (40(cid:1)50 °C). The lifetime is much
shorter than the transit time of the particles in the excitation region
(» 20 ms) due to the film motion (U D 0.5 m/s) so particle displace-
ment during the luminescence decay was not a problem.

PPreliminary measurements were performed on a heated Petri
dish filled with the aqueous LiBr solution with the same concentra-
tion (2.5 mg/L) of phosphor. No reaction between the phosphor and
the LiBr was observed and the measurements agreed with those per-
formed on powder. Those measurements were used for calibration.
An accuracy of 0.5 °C was measured by comparing the temperature
measured by optical thermometry in the Petri dish to that of a cali-
brated thermocouple.

PThe measurement of the falling film in the test stand are pre-
sented in Fig. 41. Near the top of the tube, the measured film tem-
perature is 51 °C, and as a result of the competing effects of the heat
of absorption, and heat transfer to the coolant along the height of
the tube, the second being stronger, the temperature at the interface
is shown to decrease exponentially to » 43 °C 1.4 m below. An
agreement within § 1.5 °C between repeated measurements at a
given location was observed. In addition, the temperature of the film
shortly after entering the absorber as measured with the phosphor

neers.

P(51 °C) agreed well with the saturation temperature at the absorber
pressure (1.3 kPa) of 50.4 °C.

PThe main difficulties reported in this study was interference from
the LiBr solution broadband luminescence, with a persistence of
» 1 ms, combined with a drop in the concentration of thermographic
phosphor particles over time due to particles settling within the
absorber loop. This resulted in a degradation of the measurement
accuracy in the absorber in comparison to measurements in the Petri
dish. Regardless, though this was the earliest study using thermo-
graphic phosphors for temperature measurements in fluid flows, it
was remarkably successful. Together with a variety of other meas-
urements, the film temperature data were used to derive heat and
mass transfer correlations.

PTemperature measurement of single droplets and sprays

PSpray diagnostics are much needed to improve the modelling of
the atomisation and vaporisation processes, which are key to several
industries ranging from drug delivery to the lungs to the automotive
industry. In internal combustion engines in particular, emission lev-
els are closely related to the optimisation of the fuel spray. Droplet
size, velocity and temperature are important parameters in models.
While phase Doppler anemometry is widely used to measure the
two former quantities, the few diagnostics for droplet temperature,
e.g. using dyes, exciplex fluorescence, and rainbow interferometry
are less mature. The development of an alternative approach based
on phosphor particles is therefore also desirable.

PIn Ref. [26], the temperature of individual free-falling mm-size
water and isooctane droplets were measured using the 5D2 emission
of the phosphor La2O2S:Eu3þ as in the abovementioned falling film
study. Phosphor particles (of unspecified diameter) were added to
water (1% by weight, three orders of magnitude larger than in the
previous study) in a heated tank, from which 4 mm diameter drop-
lets fell into temperature-regulated surrounding air, so in some
cases heat transfer between the droplet and the gas during the fall
could be minimised. When a droplet crossed the beam of a helium-
neon laser, a trigger signal was sent to a pulsed frequency tripled
Nd:YAG laser (355 nm, 38 mJ/pulse) with a beam diameter of 10 mm
for excitation of the phosphor particles in the whole droplet, as
shown in Fig. 42. The decay of the luminescence emission following
the laser pulse was detected by a PMT. The decay time was con-
verted to temperature using calibration data obtained from a heated
metallic plate coated with the phosphor. To examine the accuracy
and precision of the technique, the measured droplet temperature
was compared to the temperature of the liquid in the tank measured
by a thermocouple.

PIn sprays found in automotive applications, the diameter of the
droplets of interest is often much smaller (10’s of mm) than those
studied above and the droplet velocity is very high (100’s m/s). The
same lifetime imaging approach based on La2O2S:Eu3þ was applied
to image the temperature distribution in an air-assisted water spray
[28]. Here, the water-phosphor mixture was also mixed (0.25% by
mass) with a surfactant (Triton X-100) to improve the particle dis-
persion. Lower temperatures were observed in the inner core of the
spray which was attributed to evaporative cooling since neither liq-
uid nor surrounding gas were heated. It is not clear whether it is
only the liquid phase temperature or also the gaseous phase which
was being measured, but the study described above on a levitated
evaporating droplet found that the particles stayed in the droplet
during the evaporation process [27], which would support the
assumption that mostly the liquid phase temperature is measured.
With this approach, displacement over the total 30 ms lifetime eval-
uation windows led to errors which would be even more significant
in high velocity sprays found in internal combustion engines.

PTo alleviate this issue the authors suggested using the two colour
intensity ratio approach, which in principle, for a very fast phosphor,
can be made as short as the laser pulse. Br€ubach et al. presented
two-dimensional temperature measurements in n-dodecane sprays
using this method [29]. 8 mm Mg4FGeO6:Mn phosphor particles was
added to n-dodecane at a load of 1(cid:1)2% by weight. 266 nm excitation
was used with an ICCD + image doubler for two colour imaging. The
camera exposure was 1 ms with a delay of 1 ms with respect to the
laser pulse, to avoid fluorescence from the fuel. Calibration measure-
ments were performed in a optically-accessible liquid tank for which
a 0.5 K shot to shot standard deviation was reported. Average tem-
perature images of the spray were presented for different liquid
tank temperatures, as expected reflecting an increased spray tem-
perature with increasing liquid tank temperature. One of these aver-
age images is shown in Fig. 43. There are some systematic errors
left-right and top-bottom in the temperature distribution. Also, dur-
ing the long exposure time required to obtain sufficient signal
(1 ms), it was noted that the particles moved much further than the
spatial resolution (1.3 mm) so the signal was a temporal average of
the luminescence of several phosphor particles passing the respec-
tive probe volume.

PA phosphor with a much shorter lifetime such as ZnO would be
far more suitable. The luminescence lifetime of the 387 nm edge
luminescence of ZnO is below a nanosecond, and the emission spec-
trum is highly sensitive to temperature, permitting application of
the intensity ratio method with high temperature sensitivity and
short measurement duration. In Ref. [42], 2D temperature measure-
ments were performed in free falling burning mm-size methanol
droplets using ZnO:Ga and a similar two colour imaging system
(ICCD + image doubler) as described above. A mass load of 0.1%
phosphor particles in methanol was used, and as they fell, the drop-
lets were ignited using a bunsen burner. The ICCD gate time was set
to 10 ns, overlapping the laser pulse (355 nm, 5 ns, 18 mJ/pulse).
Here due to the short lifetime of the luminescence ( < 1 ns), a delay

droplets. Reproduced from [26] with permission of the Optical Society of America.

PThe droplet-to-droplet precision and deviation from the thermo-
couple were found to be better than 1 K over the range 295(cid:1)365 K.
Using the same system, measurements were also performed in iso-
octane droplets. Since the 5D2 luminescence has a lifetime of several
ms, interference from the fast fuel fluorescence can be avoided with
a delay in the lifetime evaluation window. At 289 K a precision of
0.34 K and an accuracy of 0.6 K were reported. 5 mm La2O2S:Eu3þ
particles and a similar system were also used to measure the tem-
perature decrease in time of acoustically-levitated evaporating drop-
lets [27].

PIn the same study [26], the feasibility of using the temperature
dependent emission spectrum of Mg4FGeO6:Mn4+ for the tempera-
ture evaluation was also examined. The same mass fraction of phos-
phor particles was used, but with 266 nm excitation and the
luminescence spectrum was recorded using a spectrometer and an
intensified CCD camera. The ratio of the 631 nm and 657 nm lines
was measured to infer the droplet temperature using calibration
data obtained in a heated cell filled with water/phosphor mixture.
Results obtained using both this spectral ratio and the temporal
approach using La2O2S:Eu3þ agreed well with modelled droplet tem-
peratures, accounting for heat losses as the droplets fell between the
tank and measurement location.

PThe same authors applied the same lifetime thermometry princi-
ple to imaging inside 3 mm free falling water droplets using the
same phosphor La2O2S:Eu3þ; using a fast framing camera (maximum
repetition rate 100 Mhz) [28]. Here a laser sheet (355 nm) was
formed and directed towards the middle of the droplet. The gate
delay and duration of the 7 independent ICCD cameras were
adjusted to cover (in total) approximately 1.5 times the 1/e lumines-
cence decay time, with an overlap of 50% between exposures. Fol-
lowing each laser pulse, for each pixel a decay time was fitted to this
7-point time series and converted to temperature, presumably using
the calibration data obtained with a coated heated plate and a PMT
as described in the previous study [26]. The temperature fields mea-
sured in 3 mm droplets falling from a heated liquid reservoir into
room temperature air indicated temperature inhomogenities which
according to the authors may be attributed to heat transfer. To assess
the accuracy and precision of this approach, measurements were
also performed in an isothermally heated liquid container. From
comparison with thermocouple measurements, a precision of 0.66 K
is reported. The accuracy at 343 K was found to vary from 0.6 to 5 K
depending on the choice of timing for the individual ICCD gates.

Pcollected and spectrally separated using two non-intensified cam-
eras in a beamsplitter arrangment (see Fig. 2) for an in-plane spatial
resolution of 400 mm. The intensity ratio images were converted to
temperature using calibration data obtained in a preliminary experi-
ment which consisted of the cuvette without heating block placed
on a heated magnetic stirrer plate. This offered a temperature uni-
formity of 1 K over the 25 to 75 °C range. These preliminary meas-
urements were also used to determine the 1 (cid:1) s precision, which
was better than 3 K, and the shot to shot standard deviation of aver-
age temperature 1.4 K. The maximum deviation from the fit was
0.6 K.

PA time sequence of the temperature field in the cuvette shortly
after the resistance heating block is turned on is shown in Fig 45. A
plume forms above the heating block and rises upward due to buoy-
ancy. While this approach provides temperature measurements
with high spatio-temporal resolution in liquids, as noted above, the
well-known issue of laser striping in liquids caused by refractive
index gradients can compromise the accuracy of the measurement if
the emission spectrum of the phosphor used is laser fluence-depen-
dent, as it is the case for ZnO. Phosphors with a reduced spectral
dependence on the laser fluence are therefore required for studies
where extensive beam steering may occur.

6.2. Heated air jets

PHeated round jets of air were used as reference test cases in most
temperature imaging
studies aiming to demonstrate different
approaches using thermographic phosphor tracer in gaseous flows
[14,16,19,21,31,35,39,44(cid:1)46,53,178].

PThis configuration was chosen for many reasons, chiefly because
it is an open laboratory-scale flow that is simple to build. Secondly
the radial and centreline velocity and temperature profiles can be
verified at a basic level for respective symmetry, and an initially uni-
form region followed by a continuous decrease in temperature. Thus
systematic errors from the measurement technique can easily be
detected. Also, with a few exceptions [21,31,53], in most of these
studies the jet velocity and diameter were set to be far in the turbu-
lent jet regime (Re > 2000) for which mean and fluctuating compo-
nents of both velocity and temperature have been measured in
specific heated jet configurations over a wide range of spatial loca-
tions [236,237] . This allows for qualitative comparisons. In addition,
the jet potential core can be used for in situ calibration and assess-
ment of the measurement precision (see Section 3).

PHasegawa et al. seeded a laminar heated jet of air (10 mm diame-
ter, U » 0.8 m/s, T D 500 K) with 4 mm YAG:Dy3þ particles [31]. Fol-
lowing excitation with a 355 nm laser sheet, the luminescence from
the phosphor particles was detected by a stereoscope and an ICCD
camera for two colour imaging, as well as by a photomultiplier tube
for point lifetime measurements. Both intensity ratios, and decay

Pcannot be used to avoid fast fluorescence signals induced by the
laser e.g. from the fuel. The unfiltered image of the burning droplet
without laser illumination and the temperature field measured in
the droplet are shown in Fig. 44. In the photograph of the droplet,
the strongest flame luminosity can be observed a short distance
above the falling droplet. This luminosity was supressed using a
10 ns ICCD gate time. A uniform temperature distribution can be
observed inside the droplet with a standard deviation of 0.8 K.
Colder regions may be observed at the top and around the droplet
periphery which are indictative of systematic errors, since in princi-
ple heat should be transferred from the flame toward the centre of
the droplet. The average measured temperature is 2.7 K lower than
the boiling temperature of methanol, demonstrating a good level of
overall measurement accuracy. According to the authors, it was
likely that internal reflection in the droplet caused a loss of spatial
resolution. It does seem that a fan-shaped stripe structure originat-
ing at the point where the laser sheet intersects the droplet surface
is visible, perhaps due to the laser fluence dependence of the inten-
sity ratio for ZnO based phosphors (see below).

PConvective flows

PTurbulent natural convection occurs in systems of geophysical
importance like the atmosphere, oceans, the
and astrophysical
Earth’s mantle and in stars [235], as well as in, for example, the ven-
tilation of buildings and the solidification of metals. These systems
are therefore of fundamental interest and are often studied numeri-
cally and experimentally. In the laboratory, such flows are frequently
investigated in scaled, simpler experiments with well-defined
boundary conditions, for example the Rayleigh(cid:1)B(cid:2)enard configura-
tion, i.e. a horizontal layer of fluid bounded by a heated bottom sur-
face and a cooled top surface. In such thermally driven flows the two
parameters of primary interest are temperature and velocity. With
this aim, as a demonstration the liquid temperature of a buoyant
plume was measured using ZnO particles and the two colour imag-
ing approach [15]. 1(cid:1)2 mm ZnO particles were mixed with water
(mass load of 1 mg/L, much lower than in the droplet and spray stud-
ies, but similar to that used by Miller et al. [24]). The mixture was
placed in a 28 ml (40 x 20 x 35 mm) fused silica cuvette, with a small
resistance heating block at the bottom. ZnO can be excited with laser
light at 355 nm, but it was found that at this wavelength, the Raman
scattering of water interfered with one of the luminescence channels
used for thermometry. As in the study above, since the duration of
the luminescence signal and laser pulse almost exactly match, the
Raman scattering cannot be avoided by delaying the camera expo-
sure. The frequency quadrupled Nd:YAG output at 266 nm was used
instead, thereby shifting the Raman signal to a spectral region well-
separated from the ZnO emission. An 800 mm thick laser sheet inter-
sected the cuvette and luminescence from the particles was

Ptimes were converted to temperature using data previously obtained
from a phosphor paint placed in a temperature controlled cell using
a spectrometer and a PMT respectively.

PThe lifetime of YAG:Dy is » 1 ms around 500 K and so the expo-
sure time of the camera was set to 100 ms to provide the necessary
signal level; likewise for the decay time measurement the evaluation
window has to be on the same order as the lifetime. This would lead
to unacceptable level of particle displacement in turbulent flows,
but in this study owing to low jet exit velocity this should not be
expected to influence the results.

PThe temperature field measured in the heated jet is shown in
Fig. 46, as are the centerline profiles measured by the 0-D lifetime
and intensity ratio methods and a thermocouple. Both thermocouple
and lifetime method indicate a subtle temperature decay of the jet
which is not resolved by the intensity ratio measurement, due to a
combination of measurement noise and systematic error that are
visible in the temperature image. Both optical methods indicated a
higher temperature than the thermocouple, which the authors
attributed to heat transfer caused by the thermocouple presence.
The authors supply a value of 5% temperature error, which seems to
correspond to the mean deviation between the temperature profiles
measured from the intensity ratio method and the thermocouple.
The agreement between the lifetime method and the thermocouple
is good despite the fact that the lifetime of YAG:Dy hardly changes
up to 1200 K, i.e. it is barely sensitive to temperature around 500 K
[238].

POmrane et al. combined the same detection systems (ICCD and
image doubler) and excitation (355 nm) with the phosphor
Mg4FGeO6:Mn4þ for measurements in a turbulent heated jet of air
(20 mm, U » 10 m/s) at an exit temperature of 670 K [39]. Adding a
PIV laser at 532 nm to illuminate the same particles, while recording
the Mie scattering on an additional PIV camera, they performed the
first simultaneous flow temperature and velocity measurements
using thermographic phosphors. The calibration method and the
particle size were not reported. The exposure time is on the order of
the luminescence lifetime of 1 ms, leading to a presumed displace-
ment of 10 mm during the integration time.

PThe average temperature and velocity fields obtained from 50 sin-
gle shots is shown on Fig. 47. The velocity field is as expected. The
temperature field, however, shows high fluctuations ( > 150 K) on
the left side of the jet which the authors attributed to non-uniform
particle seeding. Point measurements were also performed at various
locations on the jet centerline using the lifetime approach with a
PMT. These indicated a continuous temperature decay from 470 °C to
430 °C from 10 mm to 55 mm above the tube exit. While this trend
seemed qualitatively correct, the accuracy could not be determined

50 single shots. Reproduced from [39] with permission from Springer.

Pbecause the jet heating system was not regulated, nor was a thermo-
couple used to measure jet exit temperature. Here, one potential
issue is the large displacement (» 10 mm) of the particles during the
lifetime evalution window, meaning particles enter or leave the
probe volume during that time. It may produce the effect that the
signal will decay faster than expected, because of particles which
have been excited but which leave the probe volume (so their emis-
sion is no longer collected) and particles that enter the probe volume
(which do not emit light since they have not been excited by the
laser). Here and in general the long integration time needed to match
the decay time of Mg4FGeO6:Mn4þ using either lifetime or intensity
ratio methods, causes such significant particle displacement for this
jet, compromising the measurement accuracy and resolution.

PJordan and Rothamer also measured single shot temperature
fields in a turbulent heated jet (8.5 mm, U » 20 m/s) [45] using 8 mm
Y2O2S:Yb3þ;Er3þ phosphor particles, an upconversion phosphor,
which was excited at 980 nm (500 mJ/cm2) using an OPO/OPA sys-
tem. Unlike the two previous studies which used an image doubler,
here the luminescence filtered in the 500(cid:1)600 nm spectral region

Pused for PIV. The luminescence of the particles was detected by two
cameras positioned viewing from the same direction using a beams-
plitter arrangment (see Fig. 2) for two colour imaging. Unlike the
previous imaging studies using phosphors, here non-intensified
cameras were used. The phosphor has a 1/e lifetime of about 1 ms so
that a short exposure time of 5 ms could be used while still collecting
the whole signal. After processing, the in-plane resolution of the
measurements were 400 mm as determined using an equally
smoothed image of a resolution target, matching the laser sheet
thicknesses. The intensity ratio was converted to temperature using
calibration data performed in the same jet, at various exit tempera-
tures.

PExamples of

instantaneous superimposed temperature and
velocity fields are shown on Fig. 49 at a jet exit temperature of
530 K. White regions corresponds to regions with insufficient signal.
Here the co-flow was seeded with non-luminescent Al2O3 particles,
in order to obtain the velocity field in the whole flow while being
able to distinguish between the two streams, so as to visualise the
mixture fraction (as described below). In the three instantaneous
images, one can clearly distinguish a contorted high temperature
and velocity core region, surrounded by colder slower regions where
the jet mixes. From one shot to the other, the same region is alter-
nately occupied by hot gas and by slower-moving cold co-flowing
gas. The average field clearly indicates the mixing layers which are
the result of these individual turbulent flow realisations, as well as
the uniform-temperature jet potential core.

PTo assess the accuracy of the technique, jet temperature profiles
were measured by translating a 500 mm grounded type-K thermo-
couple through the flow 15 mm above the tube exit during steady
operation. These data were compared to time-averaged temperature
profiles extracted at the same vertical position from a single line of
independent measurements obtained using the two-colour lumines-
cence technique, as shown in Fig. 50. The profiles are evidently sym-
metrical, and the mean deviation from the thermocouple
measurements is 8.5 K (1.6%). The largest deviations are observed in
the shear layer away from the jet exit, and are likely to be caused to
statistical bias due to the absence of seeding in the co-flow, as dis-
cussed in the article. Statistics to determine the single-pixel temper-
ature precision were also gathered from 600 measurements at each
steady jet temperature, indicating a precision of 16 K and 33 K at
483 K and 683 K respectively.

PBy seeding only phosphor into the central jet, and non-lumines-
cent Al2O3 particles in the coflow, the concept of utilising the lumi-
nescence from the particles themselves to visualise the mixing
between the two streams was explored in the same study [44]. The
mixture fraction, which is defined at a given spatial position as the
mass fraction of gas originating from the central jet, was calculated
from the luminescence intensity, normalised to a reference region
(in the jet core), and corrected for thermal quenching of the

mission from Springer.

Pwas imaged on two ICCD cameras positioned either side of the mea-
surement plane. The exposure time was set to 2 ms to freeze the
flow motion. However it is shorter than the luminescence lifetime of
either line (» 50 ms), meaning only a fraction of the signal was col-
lected. The intensity ratio was converted into temperature using cal-
ibration data measured in the jet itself (in situ), which indicated that
the temperature sensitivity around room temperature is high, at
1.4%/K, but decreases to 0.7%/K at 423 K.

PSingle-shot and average measurements were presented at three
exit jet temperatures 323 K, 373 K and 423 K. Average measure-
ments only were presented at 473 K due to a lack of signal caused by
the strong thermal quenching of the observed luminescence transi-
tion. 8 mm particles were used, which are too large for measure-
ments in turbulent flows (see tracing analysis in Section 5.2), but it
is anticipated that using smaller Y2O2S:Yb3þ;Er3þ particles would
further reduce the maximum temperature for single shot measure-
ments. Fig 48 shows two single shot measurements together with an
average field at a jet exit temperature of 373 K. From the single shot
images, a higher temperature in the jet core is observed and the
average field is symmetric about the jet centreline, with a visible
broadening of the radial temperature profile and a temperature
decrease in the streamwise direction. The authors estimated a preci-
sion of 5 K at 373 K in a region of the jet where the temperature was
presumed nearly uniform, for an in-plane spatial resolution of about
600 mm (estimated from the reported binning and filtering that
were used). This study showed considerable promise, as the first to
be free of the systematic errors found in the previous heated jet
studies.

PSimultaneous temperature, velocity and mixture fraction meas-
urements were performed using 2 mm BAM:Eu2þ particles seeded
into heated round jet (8 mm, U » 30 m/s), surrounded by an 80 mm
coflow [44]. The phosphor particles were excited by a UV laser
(355 nm, 100 mJ/cm2) and a double-pulse laser (at 532 nm) was

Pluminescence and for the temperature dependence of the gas den-
sity, both using the simultaneously aquired temperature. The simul-
taneously acquired temperature and mixture fraction field showed
good correlation since both quantities are transported by the turbu-
lent flow field, and cooler regions corresponds to region where the
two streams mix. However, unlike the intensity ratio approach used
for thermometry, this mixture fraction method was dependent on
local spatial inhomogeneities in the particle number density, so
overall the single pixel precision was 20%.

PSeveral other studies have performed temperature measure-
ments (with or without simultaneous velocimetry) in turbulent
heated jets as a validation of the measurement concept, also using
BAM:Eu2þ but with an ICCD and stereoscope [35], with a double
pulse 355 nm laser and a two camera system for simultaneous ther-
mometry and velocimetry [185], or using other phosphors:
YAG:Pr3þ [46], YAG:Dy3þ [35,178], YAG:Dy3þ;Er3þ [178], ZnO [14],
and Y2O3:Eu3þ [53]. A heated jet was also used to estimate the preci-
sion of the thermographic laser Doppler velocimetry concept dis-
cussed in Section 3 for simultaneous point measurement of flow
temperature and velocity [21,22].

PIn the following, three particular imaging studies in heated jets
are highlighted, one that demonstrated an improved level of temper-
ature measurement precision ( < 1%) using the sensitive phosphor
ZnO [14]; one that uses a single camera for temperature and velocity
measurements [53]; and lastly a study in which the turbulent heat
fluxes were extracted from simultaneous temperature and velocity
measurements [16].

PWhile high precision in any temperature measurement is almost
always desirable, this is particularly important for applications
involving subtle temperature differences. Examples include natural
convection, heating and cooling of buildings, flows in compression
machines, and the cooling of electronic components. As discussed in
Section 4.4.1, ZnO particles are inherently more sensitive so the
achievable temperature precision at room temperature is improved
by a factor 3 compared to that using BAM:Eu2þ particles for the
same experimental conditions (seeding density, fluence, spatial res-
olution). The potential of ZnO phosphor particles was demonstrated
in the shear layer of a turbulent heated jet with a temperature differ-
ence of 70 K between the jet exit temperature and the coflowing
stream [14]. ZnO particles (size 1(cid:1)2 mm) were seeded into both jet
and co-flow streams and a standard measurement system, calibrated
in the flow, was used to derive the temperature (see Fig. 2).

PFig. 51 shows a single shot and an average temperature field in
the shear layer between the hot jet and the cold coflow. The single-
shot shows large vortical structures generated by the shear between
the jet and surrounding coflow. The resolution of the measurement
is enough to resolve cooler regions within these eddies, caused by

Pthe mixing of hot gas and cooler coflowing air. The average tempera-
ture field shows the effect of turbulent fluctuations, leading to some
broadening of the shear layer. The pixel-to-pixel precision was 4.0 K
at 363 K (1.1%), based on a region in the jet core. In terms of accu-
racy, the deviation with the thermocouple measurement at a refer-
ence location is 3.0 K. The deviation of the centerline temperature
profile from a constant value was 4.6 K, mainly due to laser fluence
inhomogeneities as discussed in Section 4.4.4.

PUsing a single-camera single-laser approach,Yokomori et al. per-
formed simultaneous temperature and velocity measurements in a
laminar heated air jet (8.5 mm, U » 0.5 m/s) with the phosphor
Y2O3:Eu3þ [53]. As in the other studies, the luminescence was spec-
trally filtered for thermometry using a two-colour approach, but
here with a custom-made two colour single camera imaging system
(see Fig. 14). Using a fast-phosphor screen intensifier, the camera
was exposed twice during the long luminescence decay (» 1 ms) fol-
lowing the laser pulse, so that the velocity field could be derived
from a cross-correlation between the two consecutive particle
images recorded on the same half of the chip. The ratio of the lumi-
nescence intensity recorded during the first exposure on each half of
the chip was converted to temperature using calibration data
obtained from a heated plate coated with the phosphor. The under-
lying principle is illustrated in Fig. 16 in Section 3. Time-averaged
temperature and velocity measurements were presented at five jet
exit temperatures from room temperature to 673 K. A subtle center-
line temperature and velocity decay were observed from the jet exit
to 20 mm downstream due to the laminar nature of the jet. Radial
and axial temperature profiles were compared to thermocouple
measurements, showing a good agreement. A radial velocity profile
for the isothermal case was compared to an analytical solution for
the developing jet from a fully developed laminar tube flow which
too displayed reasonable agreement. Due to the low seeding density
used in this approach, single shot measurements could not be per-
formed.

PExperimental data for the turbulent heat flux in well-defined test
cases, such as the turbulent round jet are much needed for the
refinement of numerical models of turbulent flows based on Rey-
nolds-averaged Navier(cid:1)Stokes (RANS) equations or large eddy simu-
lations (LES).
[16], simultaneous
measurements of temperature and velocity were performed in a
heated jet (d D 16 mm, U » 20(cid:1)40 m/s) surrounded by a coflow also
using the phosphor BAM:Eu2þ; in order to evaluate radial and axial
turbulent heat fluxes. Non-intensified cameras in a beamsplitter
arrangment were used for the detection of luminescence. In order to
evaluate the turbulent fluxes without statistical bias, both coflow
and central jet were seeded with phosphor particles. In this case,
particular attention was paid to minimise interferences from multi-
ple scattering as discussed in Section 5.5. The accuracy of the calibra-
tion fit was 4 K. One diameter downstream of the nozzle exit, the
average radial temperature profile was compared to thermocouple

tion of 25 K in the shear layer. A single-shot single pixel standard
deviation in the jet core at 620 K of 2.9% was reported.

PThe radial and turbulent fluxes were evaluated from the time-
average of the product of the fluctuating components of the radial
and axial velocity components and the temperature. The gradient
diffusion model, often used in numerical flow simulations, can be
expressed for e.g. the radial component:

where u0 and T0 designate the fluctuating components of the radial
velocity and temperature respectively, and the overline designates
the temporal average. at is the turbulent heat diffusivity. To explore
the validity of this model, at various spatial locations, the measured
radial turbulent flux was compared to the mean radial temperature
gradient. The results, shown in Fig. 52 (left) indicate that in the near
field (x/d D 1; 4) the relation between both quantities deviates sig-
nificantly from linear. The magnitude of the temperature gradient
also decreases with distance from the jet exit, as the jet spreads. Pol-
ynomials were then fitted to the turbulent heat flux with the mean
temperature gradient as the independent variable, to evaluate the
turbulent heat diffusivities at various location downstream of the
tube exit. The results are shown in Fig. 52 (right). In the near field (x/
d D 1; 4), the extracted thermal diffusivity varies significantly with
radial location, but seems independent of the Reynolds number. Fur-
ther downstream, the dependence on the radial location is weak, but
the turbulent heat diffusivity now scales almost linearly with the
Reynolds number. Turbulent heat fluxes were also measured by
Schreivogel and co-workers in the film cooling flows described in
section 6.4.4. [20]. Both studies demonstrate the wealth of informa-
tion that can be extracted from simultaneous single shot tempera-
ture and velocity imaging for the advancement of turbulent flow
models.

6.3. Measurements in internal combustion engines

PSome of the earliest examples of gas temperature measurements
using phosphor particles were inside optically-accessible IC engines.
This is not suprising since IC engines feature a rich variety of in-cyl-
inder processes (spray dynamics, turbulent mixing, near-wall heat
and mass transfer, chemistry), that require investigation, towards
improving efficiency (fuel economy and CO2 output) and reducing
pollutant emissions (NOx; unburned hydrocarbons, CO, particulates
e.g. soot). These processes are often by nature transient, stochastic
and coupled, and are especially critical for advanced combustion
technologies such as partially premixed and homogeneous charge
compression ignition (HCCI), direct-injection stratified charge and

Pso forth; and when using alternative fuels e.g. biodiesel, ethanol
etc. With this in mind, application of phosphor thermometry to
the gas phase as well as on surfaces in IC engines is a key area of
development.

PUsing phosphor particles as a tracer, the first engine studies were
of HCCI combustion. Basically, very early injection or port-fuelling
generates a lean, homogeneous fuel-air mixture which is com-
pressed to autoignition.
It is an attractive combustion concept
because of the near negligible NOx and smoke emissions and high
efficiency. However one of several drawbacks is the steep rate of
heat release. Actually, it is thermal stratification in the bulk charge
caused by wall heat transfer and turbulent mixing that staggers igni-
tion, moderates the heat release rate, and reduces the rate of pres-
sure rise. Therefore, investigations of the temperature (and velocity)
field are needed.

PThe early studies of Hasegawa et al. used the YAG:Dy3þ phosphor
(4 mm particles) for thermometry only. The particles were seeded
into the intake manifold of a 4-valve modified Diesel engine
(82.2 £ 94 mm bore £ stroke) run at 1200 rpm in HCCI mode
[31(cid:1)33]. The engine was port-fuelled (fuel-air equivalence ratio
f D 0.27) with either isooctane [32] or 50/50 isooctane/n-heptane
blends [31,33], for which the compression ratio (CR) and intake tem-
peratures were 15.6 and 393 K or 12.2 and 363 K respectively. The
laser sheet (355 nm, 80 mJ/pulse) propagated horizontally into the
cylinder through a full silica ring and images of the vertical plane
were captured using an ICCD and stereoscope for intensity ratio
imaging. The laser repetition rate was 10 Hz and measurements
were phase-locked to different timings during the cycle.

PThe temperature calibration was executed in a heated test cell, on
a solid metal rod coated with phosphor using ceramic cement. Initial
validation in an electrically-heated jet found good agreement
between measurements using a type-S thermocouple, the lumines-
cence lifetime, and the intensity ratio methods of 5% error at
» 500 K see Section 6.2. The lifetime measurements were used to
optimise the gate time in the engine experiments to 100 ms. Also, to
avoid fluorescence and laser Mie scattering a 100 ns laser-camera
delay was used.

PIn the engine experiments, a 2% drop in the temperature was
noted when seeding the particles. It was also mentioned that dam-
age to sealing in the engine occured after a few hours of seeding
[32]. Between approximately 10 and 15 crank angle degrees before
top dead centre (CAD BTDC), depending on the fuel and operating
conditions and 20 CAD after top dead centre (ATDC) reliable results
could not be obtained due to background signals caused by chemilu-
minescence. This was characterised in a separate experiment with
no particle seeding, which showed that at 5 CAD BTDC, flame lumi-
nosity could be as high as 30% of the luminescence intensity, render-
ing accurate measurements impossible. Outside these crank angles,

Ptemperature deviation against Reynolds number at different engine
speeds, finding a linear relationship at crank angles before the onset
of combustion. For these operating conditions, measurement could
be performed up to 10 CAD BTDC, for which “flame kernels” with a
size 1(cid:1)3 mm were identified with peak temperatures of 1100 K and
local temperature gradients up to 300 K/mm. Unburned zones at
this crank angle were again attributed to turbulent transport of gases
at a lower temperature from the boundary layers. Unfortunately, in
these studies velocity measurements were not conducted simulta-
neously. Though in principle a wealth of information could be
extracted from studies like these, two key parameters are missing:
1) there is no indication of the single-shot pixel-to-pixel precision at
high temperatures, and so the nature of the temperature inhomo-
genities (e.g. as those shown in Fig. 54) cannot be reliably ascer-
tained; and 2) though a geometric spatial resolution of 180 mm is
mentioned, it is not clear whether it is based on the projected size of
a camera pixel, or from recording images of a resolution target.
Note that the engine study of Neal et al. described below reported,
using very similar ICCDs and images of a resolution target, a
degraded spatial resolution equivalent to 8(cid:1)12 camera pixels [47].
The reliable identification of fine structures/gradients and tempera-
ture inhomogenities calls for thorough validation of the precision
and spatial resolution in well-defined test cases.

PA detailed understanding of Diesel combustion processes has
enabled the reduction of the emissions of these engines, and laser
diagnostic techniques have played an important role in investigating
the spray, the subsequent vapourisation and mixing of the fuel with
ambient air, and ignition and combustion [239]. Phosphor thermom-
etry was used by Takada et al. to investigate Diesel combustion in
the same engine as above [43]. The engine was run at 1200 rpm with
CR D 13.2, the intake temperature was 368 K, and n-heptane or
isooctane were used as fuel and injected at 3 CAD BTDC. 4 mm
BAM:Eu2þ or YAG:Dy3þ particles were used as a tracer to measure
the temperature in the vertical plane through a glass piston bowl
geometry as shown in Fig. 55. 355 nm excitation was used for both
phosphors, and again an ICCD and stereoscope with appropriate fil-
ters for each phosphor was used to detect the luminescence emis-
sion for intensity ratio imaging. Note that no results were presented
for BAM:Eu2þ. The same calibration procedure as described above
(solid object in test cell) was used.

PIt was stated that measurements were only possible only up to
TDC (3 CAD after the start of injection), again due to intense chemi-
luminescence from combustion. It was also noted that the phosphor
particles stick to walls, causing severe background interference. An
SiO2 nanoparticle coating applied to the particles (see Section 3.2.1)
was used to combat this. The evolution of the background signal
after stopping seeding YAG:Dy3þ particles both with and without
this coating was tested, indicating an improvement of the signal to
background ratio from 4 to around 6(cid:1)7. However, it is not clear how
repeatable the measurements are, and whether deposition changes
for different operating conditions or measurement runs.

PTemperature images were obtained using the YAG:Dy3þ phos-
phor for a motored case, where cooler regions were observed, which
the authors attributed to heat transfer to the piston. Fired results
using both fuels were also presented. A six hole injector was used
and the laser sheet directly crosses the axis of the fuel jet in the field
of view, as shown in Fig. 55. Mie scattering images at 1 CAD BTDC (2
CAD after the start of injection) clearly indicated the presence of liq-
uid fuel, yet at these times temperature data through the whole field
could still be determined, as shown in Fig. 55. Presumably, particle
seeded air was entrained by the high-velocity fuel jet. Cooler tem-
peratures could be identified in these regions since the fuel tempera-
ture is lower. Higher temperatures could be observed in the
surrounding gas when using n-heptane, supposedly because the fuel
vapour started reacting.

nar measurements in the HCCI engine, for 50/50 isooctane/n-heptane fuel CR D 12,

Pgood agreement within 5% between the spatial average of the phase
averaged temperature field extracted from the imaging results and a
mass-averaged thermodynamic calculation based on the cylinder
pressure was achieved, as shown in Fig. 53.

PSingle shot measurements from measurement sequences phase-
locked to different crank angles are shown in Fig. 54, for the n-hep-
tane isooctane blend, and CR D 12.2 [31]. Histograms of measured
temperatures indicate that at 35 CAD BTDC the mean temperature is
621 K with a deviation of 32.9 K. The authors attribute the spatial
variations visible in Fig. 54, not to measurement noise but instead to
turbulent transport of low temperature gas from the boundary
layers [31]. For the engine running on isooctane with a CR of 15.6
[32], the single shot results were used to correlate the dimensionless

Pcompared to average temperatures using phosphor thermometry
data obtained at 10 Hz and phase-locked to different crank angles
between 80 and 30 CAD BTDC. A good agreement of 5% was
obtained, as shown in Fig. 56. The intensity ratio sensitivity increases
with temperature and the particle number density also increases
with the cylinder pressure, so the single-shot precision improves to
30 K at a mean bulk temperature of 560 K at 30 CAD BTDC. As stated
above, using ICCDs the measured spatial resolution was between
8(cid:1)12 pixels, corresponding to 0.5 to 1 mm in the object plane. This
analysis of single shot temperature precision was performed for a
small region of the images where the temperature is expected to be
homogeneous. This step is essential to characterise the performance
of the measurement technique before it is applied to cases where
the fields inside the cylinder will be non-uniform, e.g. as in the above
Hasegawa studies [31(cid:1)33], or for conditions of increased turbulent
and wall heat transfer.

PAnother reason why among the other examples this engine study
was especially noteworthy is its wealth of practical considerations.
The cylinder head was painted with a low reflectivity silicon-based
paint to reduce reflections, as well as being coated with a thin layer
of soot from a rich diffusion flame before each measurement run.
This is particularly important since in this case the clearance near
TDC was very small and the surfaces (piston and cylinder head)
were very close to the horizontal plane. The study mentions that the
seeding should be sufficient for measurements, but not too much so
as to generate high background signals caused by particle deposi-
tion, or clog the piston rings. Al2O3 nanoparticles were mixed with
the YAG:Pr3þ particles, yet still, bursts of particles caused by the
seeding system reportedly compounded the deposition issue. Depo-
sition led to systematic errors e.g. the valve seats visible in the aver-
age temperature images, which masked genuine nonuniformities
arising from heat transfer to and from the exhaust and intake valves;
and limited the number of images (typically 10(cid:1)20) that could be
recorded before the background was too strong. Beyond 30 CAD
BTDC the results were unreliable, with measured temperatures actu-
ally decreasing toward TDC. As discussed in Section 5.4, this was
attributed to a long-lived (10’s ms) fluorescence signal from the pis-
ton window induced by scattered laser light. Solutions such as exci-
mer laser grade fused silica and narrower interference filter bands
were suggested. It should be emphasised that phosphors that can be
excited nearer the visible spectral region, at 355 nm for example, are
very much preferred to reduce such interference.

P4(cid:1)6 mm Mg4FGeO6:Mn4þ phosphor particles (also with SiO2
nanoparticle coating) were used by Someya et al. to study the tem-
perature and velocity distributions in a motored engine [52]. The

PStudying the gas temperature and velocity inside a motored
engine is useful to understand the turbulent flow and heat transfer
to the cylinder walls. The study of Neal et al. used 1.8 mm YAG:Pr3þ
phosphor particles to measure temperature and velocity fields in a
motored optically-accessible small-bore Diesel engine [47]. The
engine had a bore £ stroke of 82 £ 76.2 mm and CR 12.3. It was run
at 1200 rpm for two different intake temperatures of 383 and 303 K.
In this study temperature and velocity in the horizontal plane were
measured. The laser sheets (266 nm light for excitation and 532 nm
light for PIV) propagated through windows in the cylinder liner.
Luminescence and scattering signals were collected through a flat
sapphire piston crown and directed towards the detection system
(two ICCD cameras and beamsplitter and PIV camera) using a mirror
at 45°. The calibration was performed using the same detection sys-
tem observing aggregated powder in a furnace, looking through the
same sapphire piston cap. During calibration the temperature sensi-
tivity was optimised via the laser-camera delay and exposure times
to maximise the intensity ratio sensitivity between 625 and 775 K,
as discussed in Section 3.2.3, since this is the temperature range of
key interest for this motored engine study.

PThe bulk gas temperature was calculated using the ideal gas law
with input cylinder pressure data and a two-zone method that sepa-
rately accounts for the bulk gas volume and crevice volume, which is
assumed to be at the wall temperature. This estimation was

Pengine featured a pentroof cylinder head with cylinder dimensions
86 £ 86 mm (bore £ stroke). Measurements were carried out at 700
and 1500 rpm, intake pressure of 0.38 bar and intake temperature of
326 K. The laser sheet (355 nm) was coupled into the cylinder verti-
cally using a 45° mirror and a glass piston, and the plane was imaged
through a sapphire window installed in the liner. The method was
the single laser (12.5 Hz repetition rate) and high-speed camera
approach for lifetime imaging as described in Section 3.1.2.

PPhosphor particles sticking to the wall were mentioned to affect
the gas temperatures measured adjacent to the wall, which may be
significant here because the laser sheet is dumped onto the cylinder
head, causing a lot of scattering. The low repetition rate measure-
ments were phase-locked to crank angles from 60 CAD BTDC to TDC,
and average data derived from temperature images were extracted
for both engine speeds. Unfortunately there is no comparison with
expected in-cylinder gas temperatures. Good precision was obtained
at TDC, where temperatures are around 800 K, but as discussed in
Section 3.1.2, the precision at all other (lower) temperatures should
degrade considerably as the lifetime is longer.

PAll studies discussed here reported the issue of particle deposi-
tion in the confined environments of engine cylinders. Particle depo-
sition occurred over time, and this considerably limited the number
of datapoints recorded before the influence of background signals
was deemed unacceptable. However,
if measurements were
recorded at a much faster rate, e.g. at several kHz, then many more
datapoints can be recorded during the same time period for a much
improved convergence of the data. kHz-rate measurements also per-
mits the tracking of fast transient events, e.g. in the mixture prepara-
tion, that can then be correlated to the outcome of each cycle
(pressure peak, occurence of misfire) in an effort to investigate the
cause of cycle-to-cycle variations. It is also clear that reference tem-
perature data are of paramount importance, in particular of homoge-
neous temperature fields, in order to validate the measurements in
terms of precision and systematic errors, before applying them for
measuring the temperature distributions in the operating mode of
interest.

PMeasurements inside a high pressure gas spray chamber

PIn the work of van Lipzig et al., temperature measurements were
performed inside a high pressure, high temperature fixed volume
chamber using the phosphor BAM:Eu2þ [37]. The purpose of this
work is related to the Premixed Charge Compression Ignition (PCCI)
concept, which relies on earlier injection during the compression
stroke, which aims at improved mixing of fuel and air than in tradi-
tional compression ignition engines for lower NOx and soot levels,
but also maintaining a degree of control over load and combustion
phasing. The said spray chamber is used to investigate fuel sprays
under engine-like PCCI conditions, thus diagnostics are required to
characterise local temperature distributions, which has a strong
influence on ignition.

PThe test case consisted of a cubic optically-accessible combustion
chamber, initially filled with a mixture of ethylene, oxygen, nitrogen
and argon at a pressure above 10 bar, which was then burned so as
to produce, upon cooling of the chamber, the desired temperature,
pressure and density conditions prior to spray injection. 4 mm phos-
phor particles were seeded into the nitrogen stream early in the fill-
ing procedure using a commercial powder injector consisting of a
fluidised bed and a venturi tube. Due to the lengthy filling procedure
(» 100 s), settling of the particles caused the number density in the
center of the chamber to drop significantly before the post-combus-
tion events of interest, leading to a decrease in the luminescence
intensity of approximately 80%. The mixing fan could not be used
because it reportedly increased the particle deposition. Suspended
particles were excited by a laser light sheet at 355 nm in the vessel
mid-plane, and the luminescence was detected by two ICCDs located
on opposite sides of the measurement plane. The luminescence

Pimages were filtered to a resolution of about 2 mm. After division,
the ratio images were converted to temperature data also obtained
during the post-combustion cooling phase. During this phase, the
mass-averaged temperature in the vessel can be accurately esti-
mated from the vessel pressure using the ideal gas law. A spatially
averaged intensity ratio was computed for different times in the
cooling phase, and compared to the mass-averaged temperature to
form a calibration curve. This post-combustion calibration curve was
compared to another spatially averaged datapoint obtained before
combustion. Interestingly, the agreement showed that the intensity
ratio of the particles was not affected by the combustion event as
discussed in Section 4.4.3.

PFig. 57 shows the main results of these measurements. The tem-
perature was evaluated at three vertical locations, one at the center,
and two others 30 mm below and above this midpoint. The curves
plotted in Fig. 57 are the average over 3 measurement runs. In the
cooling phase, measurements were only possible after the local tem-
perature fell below 650 K , due to the thermal quenching of the lumi-
nescence emission. Measurements at the top location were only
possible even later, presumably due to low seeding density at this
location caused by particle settling, which is also confirmed by the
higher noise level at this location. At time tD4 s, there is a 150 K dif-
ference between temperatures evaluated at the top and bottom,
which the authors explain by the buoyancy of hot gases. This differ-
ence gradually decays and is, within the measurement uncertainty,
uniform at t D 15 s. The precision is determined from the standard
deviation of spatially average measured temperature over repeated
experiments, which increases from 30 K at 393 K to 60 K at 650 K.
While measurements were successfully performed in this challeng-
ing configuration, unfortunately the targeted engine-like conditions
for spray injection at higher density and temperature could not be
reached. For higher densities, the filling time is longer, and the drop
in signal higher, so the seeding density limits the maximum measur-
able temperature. Improvement in the seeding apparatus allowing
seeding at later time would be necessary.

PImaging measurements performed at a sampling rate of several
kHz or more are immensely valuable to track unstable flow behav-
iour in time. However, as discussed in Sections 1.4 and 3.2.2, many
temperature imaging techniques, e.g. Rayleigh thermometry, require
high laser energy which cannot be delivered with off-the-shelf high-
repetition rate DPSS lasers. The first application of phosphor par-
ticles to kHz-rate temperature and velocity imaging used a

Pfrequency-tripled DPSS laser (355 nm, 1.3 mJ/pulse at 3 kHz) to
excite seeded BAM:Eu2þ particles [19]. As mentioned in Section 4.4.4,
when using BAM:Eu2þ; a fluence of around 5(cid:1)10 mJ/cm2 is sufficient
for precise single-shot measurements. Two high-speed CMOS cam-
eras (12 bit, 1024 £ 1024 pixels) in a beamsplitter configuation
were used to detect the luminescence emission for intensity ratio
imaging. Simultaneously a dual-cavity frequency-doubled DPSS laser
(532 nm) and a high-speed CMOS camera positioned on the opposite
side of the measurement plane were used for PIV. 2800 tempera-
ture-velocity images for each 0.9 s recording were stored.

PThe temperature calibration and evaluation of the single-pixel
temperature precision were performed in the potential core of an
electrically-heated jet of air. Based on statistics in the jet core, a pre-
cision of 4.9 K at 293 K (close to the noise limit of 3.8 K predicted by
signal statistics) and 21.9 K at 500 K was achieved. The point here is
that, since the luminescence of BAM:Eu2þ saturates, the low pulse
energy of the DPSS laser does not significantly compromise the pre-
cision in comparison with the use of flashlamp-pumped Nd:YAG
lasers. At least when the measurement domain is a few centimetres
in size, the same signal per particle can be achieved. The CMOS cam-
era performance was evaluated, see Section 3.2.3, with the finding
that non-linearities were not significant either, while the higher
readout noise is partly compensated with larger pixel size. This
study also noted that since the laser pulse energy was constant up to
10 kHz the thermometry could actually be performed at this rate
with no compromise in temperature precision. The limitation is
imposed by the PIV camera, which must operate at full frame read-
out to maximise the resolution, and twice the repetition rate. With
some DPSS lasers and CMOS cameras now on the market in 2017,
temperature imaging at 40 kHz with 1,024 £ 512 pixels is feasible.

PIn the same work the high-speed diagnostics were applied at a
sampling rate of 3 kHz to the Von K(cid:2)arm(cid:2)an vortex street [19]. This is
a well-known flow instability, which consists of a pattern of wake
vortices that are repeatedly shed when there is a flow around a bluff
body. The test case consisted of an air flow seeded with 2.4 mm
BAM:Eu2þ phosphor particles, emanating from an 80 mm diameter
pipe at a temperature of 293 K and velocity of 1.6 m/s. A 6.25 mm
diameter pipe electrically-heated to 530 K was positioned horizon-
tally in the flow. The same setup described above was used. The hori-
zontally-orientated laser sheets intersected the flow perpendicular
to and just above the heated pipe, and luminescence and scattering
signals were recorded at 90° to the light sheet using 3 high-speed
CMOS cameras.

PFig. 58 shows a sequence of four temperature and velocity fields
measured in the wake of the heated cylinder. The mean velocity field
was subtracted from the instantaneous fields to visualise the eddies.
Here only every fifteenth image from the original 3 kHz recording is
displayed. Counter-rotating pockets of hot gas are alternately shed

Pfrom either side of the pipe due to the unsteady flow separation at
the rear stagnation point. A video of these measurements is available
as a supplementary material to Ref. [19]. The vortex shedding fre-
quency was approximately 40 Hz, in good agreement with an esti-
mated shedding frequency calculated from the Strouhal number in
this regime of Reynolds number (here Re D 700). The diagnostics are
able to resolve the transient behaviour with a high level of precision,
which is essential to study infrequent or oscillatory heat and mass
transfer phenomena encountered in many flows of practical engi-
neering importance.

PLiquid fuel jets in hot air crossflow

PSpray investigations using phosphors has so far been discussed in
the context of liquid fuel injection in IC engines. Fuel injection is also
very important in gas turbine combustors, where the breakup, atom-
isation and vapourisation of the fuel jet in the presence of a hot,
high-velocity crossflowing gas must be properly understood. Two
studies by Tan et al. reported on a joint temperature/fuel concentra-
tion/droplet detection technique using YVO4:Eu3þ phosphor par-
ticles [38,172].

PInitially spectroscopic investigations of 50 nm and micron-size
YVO4:Eu3þ and YAG:Dy3þ particles dry-coated onto ceramic bars
and dispersed in Jet-A fuel were conducted. Nanoparticles were
wished for, to minimise the effect of particles on the spray and
reduce abrasion damage to the fuel injector, but signal levels were
too low. Much brighter YVO4:Eu3þ luminescence in the red spectral
region allowed the supression of the broadband blue-green Jet-A
fluorescence signal compared with the weak blue-green emission of
YAG:Dy3þ. Regardless, presumably this was not an issue since the
camera exposure was delayed with respect to the laser pulse (see
below). Measurements of the overall luminescence signal at temper-
atures between 300 and 773 K were used to derive the concentration
field (also see below). The intensity ratio-temperature response of
1.8 mm YVO4:Eu3þ particles was investigated for various laser-cam-
era delays. For short delay (0(cid:1)10 ms), a non-monotonic behaviour
and a low sensitivity were observed, while a useful response could
be obtained for a delay of 100 ms. In the following a delay of 100 ms
and a gate time of 30 ms was used.

PIn the test rig, temperature-controlled Jet-A fuel was seeded with
phosphor particles and injected vertically upwards through a
0.67 mm diameter orifice in the lower wall of a rectangular channel
(25.4 £ 31.75 mm), into heated crossflowing air. The laser sheet
propagated downwards into the channel through a window and
luminescence and Mie scattering signals were collected through
another window along a single optical axis at 90° using three cam-
eras and beamsplitters (see Section 3.2.5). The intensity ratio
method was used to derive the temperature field and then applied
to condition for the temperature dependence of the luminescence

Psignal, thereby obtaining the concentration field from either lumi-
nescence image. A similar approach was discussed in the previous
Section 6.2, and in Ref. [44]. Based on the assumption of equal mass
transfer from liquid-phase to gas-phase between particles and fuel,
a comparison between the concentration field derived from the
luminescence signal, and the Mie scattering field may in principle
allow the qualitative identication of regions where fuel is in the gas-
phase.

PAverage and instantaneous temperature fields as well as average
concentration and fuel Mie scattering images were presented, for a
75 m/s crossflow at a temperature of 713 K and fuel temperature of
323 K, at a momentum flux ratio of 10. The temperature increased
downstream, indicating heating of the fuel by thermal mixing. The
concentration profile also shows qualitatively a similar behaviour.
However many artefacts are observed which can be explained from
experimental considerations. One of the main issues was the long
laser-camera delay (100 ms) and exposure (60 ms) used. Considering
the high flow velocities used here (75 m/s), as in some of the studies
described above e.g.[28,39], particles emitting luminescence were
significantly displaced by up to several mm during the exposure
leading to blurring of the measured fields. Also particles were trans-
ported away from the region where they were excited, so at the
time of observation near the nozzle only particles which have not
been illuminated are present, leading to low signals near the nozzle
and displaced peak fuel concentrations. Also the Mie scattering from
liquid fuel was collected at the instant of the 355 nm laser pulse.
Therefore the liquid+vapour (luminescence) and liquid fuel only
(Mie) concentration images were presumably displaced relative to
one another. Background signals caused by luminescence of particles
deposited on the wall that was multiply-scattered by the spray also
resulted in artificially high concentration regions near the wall.

PFor such a study, clearly a phosphor with a shorter lifetime is
desirable. Regarding the fuel concentrations, it was also recognised
that (1) the particles do not evaporate with the fuel, but will rather
concentrate to some degree in the droplets, and also (2) that the Mie
signals depend on the unknown number density and size of the fuel
droplets. These factors must be considered to extract quantitative
fuel concentration profiles.

PAir/vitiated gas mixing layer

PRothamer and coworkers measured temperature and velocity
fields in a large-scale facility where two streams met behind a split-
ter plate to investigate turbulent mixing in high temperature flows.
This has applications in e.g. afterburners. One stream was a vitiated
high-temperature gas into which Jet-A fuel is normally injected, the
other a clean air stream. 1.8 mm YAG:Pr3þ phosphor particles (with
an Al2O3 coating) were used as a tracer for two-colour ratio imaging
and PIV. The laser sheets (266 nm excitation for YAG:Pr3þ and 532 nm
for PIV) propagated downwards into the optically-accessible test sec-
tion, to measure at two cross-stream locations in the mixing region. In
one test case a bluff body was placed behind the splitter plate. Various
conditions were run with the clean stream temperature » 500 K and
25 m/s, and vitiated stream temperatures up to 873 K and just over
100 m/s. The intensity ratio-temperature calibration was performed in
a furnace to 1700 K. Although the intensity ratio peaked at 1300 K and
then decreased with temperature, the maximum flow temperature
(873 K) ensured there was no ambiguity.

PAverage and single shot temperature and velocity images of the
mixing region were presented. Both streams were seeded but it was
reportedly difficult to get a sufficient number of particles in the viti-
ated stream so only 10 to 15% of the recorded images could be used.
Depending on the seeding density, it was observed that the SNR var-
ied spatially, where it became worse in the higher-temperature viti-
ated flow. Still,
for exemplary single shots, the precision (1s
standard deviation) in a uniform temperature region was found to
be as high as 20 K at 873 K, an extraordinary 2.3%. Average

Ptemperatures compared to those measured with a thermocouple
were within » 15 K. In this flow the buoyancy effects were small rel-
ative to the kinetic energy of the flow, and analytic solutions for a
turbulent plane mixing layer could be used for additional compari-
son. Good agreement between these solutions and the temperature
and velocity measurements were found for the cross-stream and
streamwise mixing profiles. This study is a good example of simulta-
neous measurements in a challenging environment: a large,
enclosed facility at intermediate temperatures and high flowrates.

PFilm cooling

PFilm cooling is a key technology in modern gas turbine engines,
consisting of a flow of air (‘coolant’) taken from the compressor stage
that is directed through holes drilled at an angle in the combustor
liner which then (ideally) spreads out to form a protective film.
Reduction of NOx emissions in gas turbine combustors is achieved
using lean combustion, but increases the demand for fresh air in the
combustor and reduces the amount of air available for film cooling.
Thus, different configurations, e.g. trenched cooling holes, where the
holes are placed in a transverse slot can be used to reduce mixing
between coolant and combustion gases and encourage lateral spread
of the coolant, reducing the cooling air requirement [240]. Most
experimental studies of these flows is based on cooling effectiveness
measurements at the surface e.g. [241]. However to design more effi-
cient film cooling geometries, non-intrusive measurements of the
flow temperature, velocity and derived quantities like the turbulent
heat flux are needed in well-defined, generic flow configurations.

PTo this end, BAM:Eu2þ particles were used for temperature and
velocity imaging of film cooling flows in an optically-accessible
closed-loop wind tunnel facility. The electrically-heated main flow
(um D 10 m/s and Tm D 373 K) was driven by a radial blower through
a settling chamber into the 400 (w) £ 150 (h) mm test section. Two
hole configurations were studied: a row of three cylindrical holes
(diameter D 6 mm) and trenched cooling holes (test plate shown in
Fig. 59). Liquid-nitrogen-cooled cooling air was supplied through
these holes via a plenum and the flow temperature adjusted using
an ambient air bypass. Thus critical non-dimensional parameters
(velocity, density, momentum ratios) that govern the mixing and
cooling jet penetration could be altered. Both the main and cooling
flows were seeded with 2.4 mm BAM:Eu2þ particles.

PThe two-colour ratio imaging and PIV were performed at a repeti-
tion rate of 6 kHz using the setup shown in Fig. 59. The 532 nm laser
sheets for PIV entered through a window in the top of the test

Psection and perpendicular to the test surface, forming a vertical mea-
surement plane down the centreline of the middle cooling hole. Ini-
tially the 355 nm laser sheet used to excite the phosphor co-
propagated with the green light but, as shown in Fig. 32 (Section 5.4)
, this generated a very large background signal caused by the excita-
tion of particles deposited on the test plate immediately down-
stream of the cooling holes. Therefore a periscope was positioned
well downstream to direct the UV laser sheet horizontally as shown
in Fig. 59. The periscope was continuously purged with pressurised
air to prevent contamination of the turning mirror with phosphor
particles. A RANS simulation indicated there was a negligible effect
of the periscope and purging flow on the upstream film cooling flow.
Particle luminescence and Mie scattering signals were collected
through a side window using three high-speed CMOS cameras. The
temperature calibration was performed using a simple two-point
method in the main and cooling jet core, since intensity ratios
derived from spectroscopy between 217 and 373 K indicated that a
linear fit was reasonable over this temperature range. It was noted
in another film cooling study using the same phosphor particles that
the effects of multiple scattering caused the measured jet tempera-
tures to depend on the seeding density [225]. Here it was supposed
that the in-situ calibration procedure coupled with the short mea-
surement times alleviated the issue. The camera memories permit-
ted fully 18,000 images for each 3 s measurement run to be
recorded. The 6 kHz repetition rate was chosen to resolve the shear
layer fluctuations predicted at 2.6 kHz. A single shot temperature
precision of 18.4 K at 373 K, at a spatial resolution of 800 mm was
evaluated from the data.

PResults were presented for the ordinary cylindrical and trenched
holes at density DR 1⁄4 rc

ratios respectively fixed at 1.6 and 8 (subscripts c and m refer to
cooling and main flow). For these conditions the average tempera-
ture field (see Fig. 60) showed that for ordinary angled holes the jet
was completely detached from the surface. In contrast, the trenched
geometry led to a stable cooling film that appeared to be attached to
the surface. However, time-resolved image sequences indicated
instances where hot air broke through the cooling film and almost
reached the surface. This is visible at x/D » 6 in videos of the meas-
urements available online as supplementary material to Ref. [20].
The measured temperature and velocity fluctuations were also used
zT0 turbulent
to calculate the streamwise u0
heat fluxes as shown in Fig. 61 for the cylindrical hole. Comparing
the average field of Fig. 60 and the turbulent flux field of Fig. 61, it
can be seen that the negative streamwise heat flux in the upper
shear layer actually contradicts the aforementioned gradient diffu-
sion hypothesis (Eq. (22)) usually adopted in RANS simulations to
model the scalar flux. The instantaneous images for the cylindrical
hole (see supplementary material to Ref. [20]) indicated that the jet

Pbecame unstable and ejected pockets of cold air moving with a
higher-than-average velocity. It was proposed that this might be
responsible for the direction of the turbulent heat flux in the upper
shear layer deviating from normal to the constant-temperature
contours.

PThis study brought together a lot of advantages of the method to
investigate flows of technical importance. The instantaneous meas-
urements can be used to calculate average fields and the heat flux,
but also time-resolved measurements provide interpretation of
mean flow behaviour. kHz sampling rates also permit calculation of
spectra to determine dominant frequencies of e.g. shear layer fluctu-
ations. These data can be compared with numerical simulations and
thereby used to develop models, e.g., large eddy simulations (LES)
which aids the design of film cooling geometries in future gas tur-
bines. Furthermore, in an actual combustor the main flow fluctua-
tions are much higher, and these diagnostics are very suitable to
track the disturbance of the cooling film by large-scale main flow
eddies.

PFlames

PSpatially resolved temperature and velocity data is much sought
after in combustion research, and as discussed in the introduction the
task remains a significant challenge despite advancements in other
in flames thermographic
laser-based thermometries.
In principle,
phosphors possess some clear advantages: 1) they are inert, 2) they
have in general a high melting point ( > 2000 K), and 3) they are often
insensitive to the fluid environment (Sect. 4.4.3). On the other hand,
the temperature range of the technique is limited by the thermal
quenching of the luminescence. In a recent study [17], BAM:Eu2þ par-
ticles were seeded into laminar non-premixed flames with the aim of
determining a) the maximum temperature the technique can measure,
and how accurate the measurement are in reactive flows; and b)
whether phosphor particles can survive the hot flame front and there-
fore whether they can be used in enclosed environments where recir-
culation between burned and unburned gas usually occurs.

PIn this study, a fuel mixture of hydrogen and nitrogen was fed to
the inner tube of a coflow burner to produce a laminar non-pre-
mixed flame with tunable temperature range and gradients. In addi-
tion, the relatively simple hydrogen chemistry allowed accurate
simulation. 2 mm BAM:Eu2þ particles were seeded in the fuel stream.
The luminescence from the particles was detected using the typical
two camera and beamsplitter setup (see Fig. 2), while the Mie scat-
tered light from the particle was detected by a camera on the other
side for the 2D mapping of the seeding density. Intensity ratios were
converted to temperature based on a calibration curve derived from
spectral measurements of BAM:Eu2þ powder, normalised to the room
temperature ratio. To allow a spatially resolved evaluation of the mea-
surement accuracy, an axisymmetrical numerical simulation of the
flame was also performed.

PThe results are shown in Fig. 62. The measurements capture
the gradients predicted by the simulations. As the temperature
increases, the single-shot single-pixel standard deviation repre-
sented by the errorbars increases, as a result of a drop in signal. This
drop is predominantly caused by the thermal quenching of the lumi-
nescence, since at 1000 K the local seeding density is still a relatively
high 3 £ 1011 particles/m3. Higher seeding densities may slightly
increase the temperature limit, but the non-intrusiveness of the
technique will then be questionable.

PAs discussed in Section 4.4.3, the same burner running on pure
hydrogen was used to probe particles post-flame to demonstrate
their survavibility.

7. Conclusions and future work

PThe use of thermographic phosphors as tracer particles in fluid
flows is a promising addition to the portfolio of flow temperature
diagnostics discussed in the introduction. The general method
affords the advantage that the velocity can be measured at the same
time, for which the same particles serve as a tracer. This is an impor-
tant capability in furthering our understanding of turbulent flows,
especially those involving heat transfer and/or chemical reactions.
Furthermore, there is a very wide range of phosphor materials
involving a variety of luminescence mechanisms which can be used
to measure the temperature. Those phosphors that have been used
for fluid thermometry currently cover the range from 200 to 900 K.
While the higher temperature limit is imposed by phosphor-specific
thermal quenching, in-principle there is no lower temperature limit.
The advantages cited for the use of phosphors as remote surface
temperature sensors apply in many respects to flow diagnostics too,
with the features that they have a high melting point, are not con-
sumed by chemical reactions, and there is as yet no evidence that
the luminescence emissions which are actually used to derive the
temperature are sensitive to the fluid composition or pressure over
the short time scales encountered in turbulent flows.

PCommensurate with the different luminescence responses (life-
time, spectral), this review has made clear that there are various
approaches to derive temperature information, currently either at a
point or in 2D. The most common approach consists of exploiting
the temperature-dependence of the emission spectrum, preferably
using two cameras with interference filters and a beamsplitter,
which allows measurements with a short duration (» 1 ms), a usual
requirement for measurements in turbulent flows. By virtue of the
general properties of thermographic phosphors (visible emission,
broad excitation spectra, insensitivity to surrounding fluid environ-
ment) the instrumentation required is comparatively simple (non-
intensified cameras, Nd:YAG lasers), as is the signal processing
(image division, white field correction and calibration). Planar meas-
urements can also be performed at sustained kHz-rates, a unique
capability for the time-resolved study of flow instabilities. There
have been several demonstrations using various realisations of life-
time approaches, but, due to the phosphors chosen, these tended to
have longer integration times. It does not seem likely that the
extraordinary sensitivity of the lifetime can be exploited over a wide
temperature range (100’s K) in turbulent flows. Another approach
involves probing individual particles, for correlated point measure-
ments of temperature and velocity with a spatial resolution as high
as 200 mm. Using a phase shift method for the temperature evalua-
tion, high precision measurements (8 K at 850 K) were reported
with this approach. Two general conclusions are apparent: that the
principle of using phosphor particles as tracers is a flexible one; and
also that, considering the information extracted i.e. simultaneous
temperature and multi-component velocity in up to two dimensions,
with high spatial and temporal resolution, the diagnostics are fairly
straightforward. The method can easily be taken up, adapted and
developed by other research groups with different laboratory capa-
bilities, to suit various applications.

PThe review has shown that certainly not all phosphors that have
been used for thermometry so far are equal in terms of thermomet-
ric performance. To meet the conditions on accurate flow tracing,
particles on the mm-scale must be dispersed in the fluid. Therefore
one should be mindful of the statements in Section 2 regarding
desirable phosphor properties: the phosphor must be carefully cho-
sen to yield high signal level while allowing a short measurement
duration. The luminescence properties are best characterised when
particles are dispersed in a fluid, but the mass load or seeding den-
sity must be measured to provide some reference. With such meth-
ods, the emission intensity can be evaluated on a mass or per
particle basis, allowing for a direct comparison of different phosphor

Pparticles, as has so far been undertaken for BAM:Eu2þ and ZnO. The
particles can also be tested in various environment to determine
potential cross-sensitivity of the measured temperature to parame-
ters such as the gas-composition. For the phosphors and fluids
tested, the insensitivity to the fluid phase and composition was in
most cases confirmed, and any dependence only detected for
extended exposure durations. The luminescence of BAM:Eu2þ par-
ticles was also shown to be unaffected by their passage through a
high temperature flame.

PSources of measurement uncertainty were presented, e.g. particle
temperature and velocity response times, detector response, flu-
ence-dependence, surface luminescence, and multiple scattering.
The effects of the last two phenomena are in some cases severe. A
dependence of the intensity ratio on the laser fluence was observed
in different phosphors to various degrees, prompting in some cases
additional corrections. On the other hand, some sources of errors
normally present no obstacle and the uncertainty analysis is
straightforward.

PThe technique has been applied to a variety of test cases, in gases,
liquids, and in two-phase flows. These studies range from basic
proof-of-concept in heated jets, to the derivation of turbulent statis-
tics in wind tunnels, comparison to numerical simulations, and to
in-cylinder internal combustion engine measurements.

Key areas of future development

PThe choice of phosphor particles is clearly one of the decisive
experimental parameters. Different characterisation methods have
been used for bulk powders, and in gases and liquids. Phosphor par-
ticles normally possess a distribution of sizes and are irregularly-
shaped. The required data are the signal of dispersed particles (with
unambiguous measure of the mass or number of particles), size and
morphology, the temperature quenching behaviour, and the tempera-
ture sensitivity. Unified characterisation methods and a basis for com-
parison of results between research groups would accelerate progress.
PWithout question, multiple scattering is a source of error that
needs to be thoroughly studied, and as it stands, carefully and rou-
tinely considered for experiments. It may only be an issue in particu-
lar configurations involving large seeded volumes, and problematic
only for certain phosphor particles. Particle deposition and the ensu-
ing surface luminescence also present difficulties in enclosed envi-
ronments. Both of these issues may be tackled with structured laser
illumination. A more effective approach that targets the root of the
problem would be phosphor particles that emit more luminescence
relative to the amount of scattered light. The thermographic laser
Doppler velocimetry approach is well-suited to enclosed environ-
ments, and recent results show that the method can efficiently reject
both surface and multiple scattering signals, allowing measurements
as close as 200 mm to the surface.

PThese developments are illustrative of the flexibility afforded by
particle-based scalar measurements, for example, the extension of
the technique to three-dimensional “tomographic” temperature and
velocity measurements is an exciting prospect. Considering so few
phosphors have been investigated in the context of fluid tempera-
ture measurements, such developments will be closely related to
the identification and/or production of alternative phosphor par-
ticles. Producing near-spherical particles with narrow size distribu-
tion would simplify the theoretical analysis and understanding of
the interaction between the excitation laser and particles. The parti-
cle shape could also be engineered, to improve the absorption char-
acteristics, reduce multiple scattering, or improve tracing abilities,
for example hollow spheres. Lastly we emphasise that there is a vast
variety of potential compounds which can be explored to increase
the temperature range toward high temperature reacting flows,
reduce cross-sensitivities to improve the measurement accuracy,
and further enhance the measurement precision.
