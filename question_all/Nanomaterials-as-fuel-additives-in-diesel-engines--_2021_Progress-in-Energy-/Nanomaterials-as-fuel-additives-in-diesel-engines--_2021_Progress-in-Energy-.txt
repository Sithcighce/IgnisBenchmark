Nanomaterials exhibit excellent properties, allowing them to act as fuel additives to improve diesel en- 
gine characteristics. This review highlights the unique potentials of nanomaterials and their activities in 
diesel engines to achieve lower harmful diesel emissions and better engine performance. The effects of 
nanomaterial-enriched fuels on engine characteristics and engine subsystems as well as associated op- 
portunities, identiﬁed from laboratory test results obtained in recent years, are discussed. On the basis 
of two criteria, the best nanomaterial-base fuel pairs are identiﬁed from the set of the most frequently 
tested nanomaterials engaged as fuel additives in diesel engines. This is followed by a review of techni- 
cal challenges that will need to be addressed and resolved to assure practical viability of nanomaterials 
acting as fuel additives. Finally, the environmental and human health risks, exposed by investigations in 
recent years, are reviewed. Wherever possible, potential solutions to outstanding problems are addressed 
and discussed brieﬂy.

1. Introduction 

The  world  has  over  a  billion  and  a  half  passenger  cars  and 
commercial vehicles and these numbers are still expected to in- 
crease  [1] .  Road  transport  is  practically  completely  powered  by 
internal combustion engines, among which diesel engines play a 
decisive  role  [2] .  The  main  drawback  of  diesel  engine  usage  are 
harmful emissions, especially nitrogen oxides (NO x ), smoke, par- 
ticulate  matter  (PM),  carbon  monoxide  (CO),  and  unburned  hy- 
drocarbons (HC). To mitigate this problem, intensive investigations 
are being conducted in the following ﬁelds: (i) combustion man- 
agement,  mostly  related  to  fuel  injection  control  [3] ,  (ii)  after- 
treatment technology [4] , related to exhaust gas recirculation [5] , 
catalyst technologies [6] , and diesel particulate ﬁlter (DPF) [6] , and 
(iii) usage of various alternative fuels [ 7 , 8 ]. 

Nowadays,  the  most  frequently  investigated  alternative  fuel 
candidates  for  diesel  engines  are  biodiesel,  vegetable  oils,  alco- 
hols,  dimethyl  ether,  dimethyl  carbonate,  natural  gas,  liqueﬁed 
petroleum gas, methane, propane, hydrogen, and waste materials 
fuels [ 2 , 7–12 ]. Some of those alternative fuels can be used pure, 
while others are used as dual fuels, blended fuels, and emulsions. 
Engagement of alternative fuels in a diesel engine may come 
with several undesired consequences, such as, increased fuel con- 
sumption  and  NO x  emission,  reduced  engine  power,  piston  ring 
sticking, and sometimes cold start problems, just to mention some 
of the more exposed ones [ 2 , 7 , 13–16 ]. These disadvantages can of- 
ten  be  overcome  by  a  suitable  combustion  management  and  by 
usage of appropriate fuel additives. In recent years, nanomaterials 
(NMs) are becoming very promising fuel additives for diesel en- 
gines [17–21] . In order to synthesize a usable nanofuel, it is neces- 
sary to disperse NMs (in form of powder or in form of nanoﬂuid) 
into the base fuel and prevent their bonding and deposition in the 
fuel tank or fuel tubes. To obtain a uniform distribution and disper- 
sion of NMs molecules within the fuel, special treatment and ap- 
propriate surfactants are needed in order to reach a homogeneous 
and stable suspension over a long period of time [ 2 , 20 , 21 ]. 

Till  today  a  respectable  amount  of  laboratory  testing  has  al- 
ready been done to study the effects of nanofuels usage on vari- 
ous diesel engine characteristics, especially on harmful emissions 
and engine performance (brake speciﬁc fuel consumption, effective 
power, brake thermal eﬃciency) [ 2 , 17 , 18 , 20 , 21 ]. This paper offers a 
review of the results obtained so far and current status of nanofu- 
els usage in diesel engines. Furthermore, on the basis of two crite- 
ria involving either (i) all diesel engine characteristics or (ii) only 
diesel emissions, the best NMs/base fuel pairs are identiﬁed from 
the set of the most frequently tested fuel additive NMs. Lastly, it 
addresses the problems related to practical viability of nanofuels 
usage. In this scope, the opportunities and technical challenges, as- 
sociated with the use of nanofuels, such as NMs dosage and size, 
nanofuels stability, diesel particulate ﬁlter (DPF) activity and dura- 
bility, and electronic control unit (ECU) programming, are summa- 
rized; beside of this, economic aspects are also addressed brieﬂy. 
Furthermore, the potential risks of NMs usage are discussed brieﬂy 
from environmental and human health aspects. 

2. Nanofuels in diesel engines—behavior and opportunities 

Nanofuels  for  diesel  engines  can  be  prepared  from  various 
base  fuels  and  various  NMs.  The  most  frequently  used  base  fu- 
els  are  diesel  (D),  biodiesel  from  various  sources  ( source B),  oils 
from various sources ( source O), blends of diesel, biodiesel and oils 
from various sources (D/ source Bxx/ source O), water-in-various fuels 
emulsions (D/Wxx, source B/Wxx, source O/Wxx, D/ source Bxx/Wyy), 
blends  of  various  alcohols,  diesel,  and  biodiesel  from  various 
sources (D/Exx, D/ source Bxx/Eyy, D/ source Bxx/Buyy, where xx and 

2 

yy  denote  parts  in  %  of  biodiesel  ( source B),  water  (W),  ethanol 
(E)  or  butanol  (Bu).  The  sources  of  biodiesels  are:  Botryococcus 
braunii microalgae ( bba ), Calophyllum inophyllum ( ci ), cottonseed 
( cs ),  cashew  nut  shell  ( cns ),  grape  seed  ( gs ),  honge  ( h ),  jatropha 
( j ), jojoba ( jj ), lemongrass ( lg ), linseed ( l ), mahua ( m ), Mimusops 
elengi  ( me ),  mustard  oil  ( mo ),  Nerium  oleander  ( no ),  palm  ( p ), 
Pongamia pinnata ( pp ), Poultry litter ( pl ), rapeseed ( r ), soybean ( s ), 
tamarind seed ( ts ), waste cooking oil ( wco ), and Zizipus jujube ( zj ) 
[ 2 , 17 , 18 , 20 , 21 ]. The sources of oils are: lemongrass ( lg ), plastics ( p ), 
and tire pyrolysis ( tp ) [22–24] . Such variety of base fuels provides 
a wide range of opportunities to blend these fuels and to enrich 
them with various NMs in order to achieve the desired fuel prop- 
erties, leading to better engine operation.

3 ), 
The  most  frequently  used  NMs  are  aluminum  oxide  (Al 
2 ), copper oxide (CuO), iron oxide ( γ -Fe 
3 ), 
cerium dioxide (CeO 
titanium  oxide  (TiO 
2 ),  and  zinc  oxide  (ZnO)  nanoparticles  (NPs), 
carbon  nanotubes  (C  NTs),  some  core@shell  NMs,  and  function- 
alized  NMs  [ 2 , 17 , 18 , 20 ].  Since  NMs  have  a  high  speciﬁc  surface 
area (high surface area to volume ratio) and excess energy of sur- 
face atoms, they may exhibit unique physical, chemical, thermal, 
magnetic, electrical, or  optical properties, which may differ sub- 
stantially from those of bulk materials [25–28] . Consequently, NMs 
may exhibit increased reactivity or catalytic activity, superparam- 
agnetic behavior, lower melting temperatures, and higher theoreti- 
cal densities, when compared to micron and larger sized materials 
[28] . Related to their properties and behavior, NMs are often clas- 
siﬁed as inert, catalytic, and reactive NMs [ 27 , 29 ]. This strict clas- 
siﬁcation, however, might prove to be somewhat indistinct since 
under certain circumstances some of NMs may act as both, catalyst 
and reactant [30] . Furthermore, among the NMs considered in this 
3 NPs, 
review, there are no fully inert particles. Even for the Al 
which  are  often  considered  to  be  inert,  recent  research  showed 
that they exhibit a surprising catalyzing effect in combination with 
some fuels; they can greatly reduce the induction time and energy 
required to activate the exothermic reactions [31] . So, to avoid any 
classiﬁcation conﬂicts, in this paper the NMs are classiﬁed into (i) 
energetic and (ii) non-energetic NMs, Fig. 1 . 

2 O 

Energetic NMs. Energetic NMs take part as reactants in exother- 
mic reactions which increases the total released energy. For exam- 
ple, carbon-based NMs can burn in air and release heat [ 29 , 32–
36 ]. Köhler et al. [33] showed that single- and multi-walled C NTs 
can burn eﬃciently at conditions encountered in the combustion 
chamber; Nagasawa et al. [37] reported that thinner single-walled 
C NTs burn more quickly than multi-walled C NTs. Furthermore, if 
organic materials are used as shell material to cover metal-based 
core NPs, the shell of such core@shell NMs can also burn in oxi- 
dizing environments [ 27 , 38–41 ]. Guo et al. [42] reported that car- 
bon coating is an effective way to increase the reactivity and en- 
ergy content of metal and metal-oxide NMs. In this case the car- 
bon  coating  is  burnt  ﬁrst  during  combustion,  which  contributes 
to heat release of the particles. Furthermore, metal-based NPs can 
also contribute  to the total released energy. For  example, highly 
active Al NPs display a strong O-extraction capability coupled by 
a moderate capability to react with C/H/N atoms [31] . The ignition 
temperature of Al NPs, which is a strong function of the NPs size, is 
usually lower than 10 0 0 K and well below maximal temperatures 
found in the diesel engine combustion chamber [ 27 , 28 , 43 ].

Non-energetic  NMs.  Non-energetic  NMs  do  not  burn  within 
the diesel engine combustion chamber; practically all metal-oxide 
2 , and ZnO NPs, can be 
NMs, such as Al 
classiﬁed  into  this  group.  Although  not  combustible,  these  NMs 
have  an  active  role  during  various  processes  in  the  combustion 
chamber and after-treatment systems [44–48] . Namely, metal ox- 
ide NPs often engage in intermediate catalytic reactions; they may 
contribute to lower activation energy of chemical reactions and de-

crease the oxidation temperature [49–51] . Furthermore, they can 
improve  radiative  and  heat/mass  transfer  properties  of  the  fuel 
[52] as well as the thermal exchange process between fuel droplets 
and the surrounding air [53] . 

The type, size, and dosage of both, energetic and non-energetic 
NMs,  as  well  as  the  base  fuel  type  inﬂuence  the  chemical  and 
thermo-physical  properties  of  a  nanofuel  [ 18 , 27 , 28 ];  moreover, 
nanofuel properties depend also on the preparation method. Some 
synthesized  NMs  might  need  to  be  ﬁrst  dispersed  in  a  solvent; 
either  in  dH 
2 O  [ 19 , 44 , 54–60 ]  or  EtOH  [ 39 , 61–63 ]  or  in  butanol 
[ 64 , 65 ]. In these cases the so-called nanoﬂuid (this term will be 
used throughout this paper) is obtained. If the dispersion in a sol- 
vent is not required, the prepared nano-powder can be dispersed 
directly into the base fuel, usually during the post-production pro- 
cess (P-PP) of the base fuel. To prepare a nanofuel with desired 
dispersion eﬃciency and stability, two-step methods, such as ul- 
trasonication, magnetic stirring, and pH adjustment, are the most 
frequently  used.  Finally,  to  avoid  or  reduce  NMs  agglomeration 
and to improve the stability of nanofuels, various surfactants (2- 
ethylhexyl nitrate, ammonium polymethacrylate (Darvan-C), cetyl 
trimethyl  ammonium  bromide  (CTAB),  sorbitan  oleate,  sorbitan 
monooleate  (Span  80 TM ),  2-[2-[3,4-bis(2-hydroxyethoxy)  oxolan- 
2-yl]-2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)  ethoxy]ethyl  octadec-9-enoate  (Tween 
80 TM ), oleic acid, citric acid etc.) are often engaged [20] . 

In general, a comparison of the chemical and thermo-physical 
properties  of  the  base  fuel  and  the  prepared  nanofuel  shows 
that  the  addition  of  NMs  can  inﬂuence  the  fuel  density,  viscos- 
ity, ﬂash point, cetane number, thermal conductivity, and caloriﬁc 
value  [ 23 , 58 , 66–68 ].  As  a  rule,  various  authors  report  the  mea- 
sured properties of the base fuel and nanofuel without providing 
a deeper investigation of the reasons for the reported variations. 
This is not problematic for some properties, the variations of which 
are more or less expected in accordance with the properties of the 
added NMs. What is somewhat confusing, however, is the reported 
inﬂuence of NMs on the fuel caloriﬁc value. The authors typically 
abstain from any detailed explanation for the measured variations. 
So, it might be helpful to keep the following in mind: 

(i) The NMs dosages used for nanofuels are typically less than 100 
ppm  while  the  reported  variations  of  the  caloriﬁc  values  are 
roughly within the range from -5% up to + 5% [ 23 , 24 , 69–75 ]. 

(ii) The addition of energetic NMs can actually increase the caloriﬁc 
value  of  the  fuel  [ 56 , 70 ].  However,  the  typically  used  NMs 
dosages cannot justify the extent of reported variations. 

(iii) The  addition  of  non-energetic  NMs  cannot  change  the  ther- 
modynamic heat of combustion, which in turn is theoretically 
the same as the gross (higher) caloriﬁc value. The net (lower) 
caloriﬁc value measurement, however, depends on the amount 
of condensed water, which is theoretically assumed to be zero. 
In reality, in an experiment some minor amount of water might 
still  condense  and  inﬂuence  the  actually  measured  caloriﬁc 
value. So, if the net caloriﬁc value is measured, the added NMs 
might  inﬂuence  the  amount  of  condensed  water  and  conse- 
quently the net caloriﬁc value result of the experiment. 

The last argument applies to both, energetic and non-energetic 
NMs. This is substantiated by the reported results, where NMs be- 
longing whichever group were found to increase, decrease, or not 
change signiﬁcantly the caloriﬁc value of the fuel. 

2.1. NMs activities and transformation in diesel engines 

Within a diesel engine, NMs fuel additives are heavily engaged 
in various mechanical, chemical, and thermal processes [ 21 , 76–78 ]. 
The most frequently reported NMs activities, Fig. 1 , can be sum- 
marized as follows: 

(1) Secondary  fuel  atomization.  During  the  injection  and  combus- 
tion processes, practically all, either energetic or non-energetic, 
NMs  can  promote  secondary  fuel  atomization  due  to  disrup- 
tion  behavior  and  possibly  also  micro-explosions  [ 21 , 77 ].  In 
the  case  when  nanofuel  components  exhibit  similar  boiling 
points and volatilities, the improved secondary atomization can 
be explained by the disruption behavior of NMs [ 59 , 68 , 79 , 80 ]. 
Namely,  the  presence  of  NMs  within  fuel  droplets  may  re- 
sult in increased aerodynamic shear between the droplets and 
the  ﬂow  ﬁeld.  This  can  induce  severe  droplets  shape  de- 
formations,  which  may  eventually  cause  secondary  atomiza- 
tion  of  nanofuel  droplets  [81] .  The  intensity  of  this  disrup- 
tive behavior depends on the density, structure, and porosity 
of  NMs,  and  on  thermo-physical  properties  of  the  base  fuel 
as well as NMs dosage and stability of nanofuels [82] . In the 

3

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 83 (2021) 100897 

other case, when nanofuel components exhibit different boiling 
points and volatilities, secondary atomization can be caused by 
micro-explosions [ 44 , 54 , 55 ]. Since the lower-boiling-point com- 
ponents reach the critical temperature earlier than the higher- 
boiling-point  components,  this  leads  to  explosions  of  lower- 
boiling-point components within the surrounding components 
layers. Furthermore, the high speciﬁc surface of the NMs may 
induce swollen and super-heated fuel droplets, forming an ex- 
treme  vaporization  effect  [ 21 , 77 ].  This  may  further  amplify 
the micro-explosions, resulting in a number of secondary fuel 
droplets of very ﬁne size [83–86] . 

(2) Catalytic  engagement.  Practically  all  NMs,  used  as  fuel  addi- 
tives, can act as catalyst in chemical reactions during the com- 
bustion  process  and  after-treatment  of  combustion  products 
[ 21 , 77 ]. The NMs catalytic engagement results in reduction of 
the  induction  time  and  energy  required  to  activate  chemical 
reactions  [31] .  For  example,  CeO 
2  and  CuO  NPs  in  a  concen- 
tration  of  60–100  ppm  reduce  soot  ignition  temperature  to 
about 300 °C so that DPF regeneration can been achieved at a 
temperature  below  400 °C  [87] .  In  general,  the  catalytic  abil- 
ity  of  NMs  fuel  additives  depends  on  the  NMs  type,  tem- 
perature, and NMs speciﬁc surface area [ 28 , 88 , 89 ]. For exam- 
ple,  in  a  nanoparticle  with  a  diameter  of  10  nm,  15%  of  the 
atoms  are  located  on  the  surface,  while  in  the  nanoparticle 
with 1 nm diameter, all of the atoms are placed on the sur- 
face. So, smaller nanoparticles with higher speciﬁc surface area 
exhibit higher catalytic activity [ 28 , 90 ]. Furthermore, the cat- 
alytic  activity  clearly  depends  also  on  the  fuel  type  [91] .  In 
general,  a  catalyst  usually  reacts  so  that  intermediate  prod- 
ucts  are  formed  from  which  the  original  catalyst  is  later  re- 
generated in a cyclic process. For metal oxide NMs this cycle 
is typically achieved by redox reactions [ 18 , 40 , 44 , 46 , 77 , 92 , 93 ]. 
These NMs can either provide oxygen and react directly with 
CO and HC molecules and with C atoms in the soot by oxida- 
tion mechanisms or absorb oxygen for the reduction of NO x . 
2  NPs  have  the  ability  to  undergo  a  trans- 
For  example,  CeO

formation from the stoichiometric CeO

in the diesel combustion chamber [28] . In spite of that, these 
NPs may still exhibit surprising catalytic effects [ 31 , 48 , 94 ]. 
(3) Reactivity  engagement.  At  certain  conditions,  energetic  NMs 
exhibit  reactivity  engagement  in  exothermic  chemical  reac- 
tions.  In  general,  carbon-based  NMs  can  burn  in  oxygen  at- 
mosphere  and  release  heat  in  the  combustion  chamber  [ 27–
29 , 31 , 34 , 35 , 38 , 95 ]. Furthermore, the total heat released in the 
combustion chamber can be increased by exothermic metallic 
oxidation reaction [28] . Metallic particles, such as Al NPs, re- 
act to form metal oxide nanoparticles [27] . Depending on the 
metal, these oxides may then act as more or less active catalyst 
in various reactions. Furthermore, metallic NMs can react with 
fuel  components,  especially  when  the  base  fuel  contains  wa- 
ter or alcohols. In such cases, under certain circumstances NMs 
can react with water or alcohols to produce hydroxyl radicals, 
which enhance soot oxidation [ 27 , 92 ].

(4) Thermal engagement. Various NMs, especially those in the form 
of a nanoﬂuid, can exhibit thermal engagement, mainly due to 

4 

NMs  acting  as  a  heat  sink  and  thus  reducing  the  in-cylinder 
temperature [ 22 , 54 , 55 , 78 , 79 ]. Furthermore, NMs fuel additives, 
especially  those  with  higher  thermal  conductivities,  can  also 
improve the heat transfer between the ﬂame front and unburnt 
fuel particles [ 64 , 96 ]. For example, carbon NTs exhibit thermal 
conductivity which is at room temperature roughly 20 0 0 times 
greater  than  that  of  base  fuels  [ 24 , 96 ].  By  increased  thermal 
conductivity, the rate of fuel evaporation is also increased. Con- 
sequently, fuel vapor and nanoparticles are carried away from 
the droplet more quickly, and combustible mixture is prepared 
more rapidly. These characteristics may improve the combus- 
tion inside the cylinder and consequently also the engine per- 
formance characteristics [96] . 

During the NMs engagement in various mechanical, chemical, 
and  thermal  processes,  they  can  also  be  altered  themselves.  On 
their path through a diesel engine, NMs can be transformed due 
to exposure to very high temperatures and pressures for a few mil- 
liseconds (during the combustion process) as well as to moderate 
temperatures and pressures for tenths of a second while passing 
the exhaust system. Batley et al. [97] reported that CeO 
2 NPs with 
the  size  of  6–14  nm,  added  to  the  D100  base  fuel,  were  trans- 
formed during combustion into larger particles and left the diesel 
exhaust system with their size being around 43 nm. Furthermore, 
Dale et al. [98] reported that CeO 
2 NPs transformed from crystals 
of 5–7 nm in size to near spherical 50–300 nm single crystals in 
the diesel exhaust system. Apart from increased dimensions, how- 
ever, changes in the unit cell dimensions or crystalline form were 
not observed. 

2.2. Effect of nanofuels on diesel engine characteristics and engine 
systems 

Diesel engine characteristics (emissions and performance) de- 
pend heavily on the injection process (injection pressure, injection 
timing, injection rate …), fuel spray development (spray penetra- 
tion, angle, atomization …), and combustion process (ignition de- 
lay, in-cylinder pressure, in-cylinder temperature, exhaust gas tem- 
perature …) [ 7 , 13 , 99–103 ]. Nanofuels engagement can cause sig- 
niﬁcant variations in these processes. These variations are induced 
by (i) altered physical and chemical properties of the fuel (cetane 
number,  caloriﬁc  value,  viscosity,  density,  ﬂash  point  ...)  due  to 
NMs addition and (ii) NMs activities and transformations. For ex- 
ample, NMs addition can result in shorter ignition delays due to 
higher cetane numbers since the ignition delay and cetane number 
are inversely related [104–106] . Moreover, NMs induced variations 
also depend on the engaged diesel engine type. Under the bottom 
line, this means that in estimating nanofuel effects one has to deal 
with a wide set of inﬂuencing parameters. Within this context it is 
quite diﬃcult to get precise ﬁndings from rather widely scattered 
data, published in the literature. Nevertheless, a careful evaluation 
of available test results still enables to draw some general ﬁndings. 
th )  of  diesel  engine  is  improved  by 
practically  all  tested  nanofuels  [ 24 , 55 , 58 , 59 , 64 , 65 , 68 , 94 , 107 , 108 ]. 
NMs  can  facilitate  a  more  complete  combustion  due  to  higher 
evaporation  rate,  shorter  ignition  delay,  and  higher  in-cylinder 
temperatures  [ 92 , 66 ].  These  effects  are  increasingly  ampli- 
ﬁed  by  those  NMs,  which  exhibit  enhanced  catalytic  activity 
[ 55 , 65 , 68 , 109 , 110 ] or better secondary atomization [ 44 , 55 ]. 

Brake  thermal  eﬃciency  ( η

Effective  po wer  ( P e )  is  not  inﬂuenced  signiﬁcantly  when  var- 
ious  NMs  are  added  to  various  base  fuels.  Nevertheless,  a  few 
researchers  reported  about  minor  increase  of  maximal  effective 
power ( P e,max ) [ 19 , 80 , 111 ]. This was explained by addition of NMs, 
which  either  promote  micro-explosions  [19]  or  increase  the  net 
nanofuel caloriﬁc value [111] or contribute to increased nanofuel 
viscosity and density, which reduces pump leakage [80] .

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 83 (2021) 100897 

Brake speciﬁc fuel consumption ( g e ) is usually reduced by NMs 
engagement. According to published data, this is typically observed 
for NMs with higher catalytic activity [ 44 , 112 , 113 ] and secondary 
atomization [ 19 , 86 ], as well as nanofuels with higher cetane num- 
ber [114] . 

NO x  emission  is  probably  the  most  problematic  diesel  engine 
emission. According to published data, about one third of various 
nanofuel investigations show an increase in NO x  emission, while 
the other two thirds indicate minor to signiﬁcant positive effects 
on  NO x  emission.  The  most  inﬂuencing  factors  are  interactions 
among  the  cetane  number,  oxygen  mass  fraction  in  a  nanofuel, 
enthalpy of vaporization, adiabatic ﬂame temperature, ignition de- 
lay, and amounts of nanofuel burned in premixed and in mixing- 
controlled combustion phases. It has to be kept in mind, however, 
that the inﬂuence of nanofuels on NO x emission also heavily de- 
pends on the type of the engine, speciﬁc engine setup parameters, 
and engine operating regime. 

In general, NO x emission can be increased by those NMs which 
cause  a  higher  heat  release  rate,  in-cylinder  pressure,  and  in- 
cylinder temperature [70] . These effects are mostly consequences 
of NMs catalytic effects [ 59 , 111 ], which accelerate the combustion 
process  [ 65 , 73 , 115 , 116 ].  On  the  other  hand,  a  reduction  of  NO x 
emission  can  be  reached  if  the  NMs  heat  sink  effect  is  strong 
enough [ 68 , 79 , 92 , 112 ]. Besides of this, some authors reported also 
of NO x reduction by the catalytic activity of some NMs, by which 
NO x  can  be  converted  into  oxygen  and  N 
2  during  the  combus- 
tion process [ 59 , 94 , 107 ]. Furthermore, the NMs which increase the 
cetane number of nanofuels signiﬁcantly and reduce the amount 
of fuel burned in the premixed combustion phase, can reduce the 
in-cylinder temperature and consequently also the NO x  emission 
that is produced mainly in the ﬁrst part of the mixing controlled 
combustion phase [ 100 , 102 , 103 , 117 ]. 

HC  emission  is  typically  decreased  by  addition  of  various 
NMs  to  various  base  fuels.  This  effect  can  be  observed  when 
NMs  act  as  oxidation  catalysts  due  to  their  oxygen  content 
[ 54 , 55 , 59 , 86 , 118 , 119 ]. Further  reasons  are  accelerated  combustion 
due to the NMs catalytic effects [ 65 , 80 , 120 ] and better secondary 
atomization  [92] .  On  the  other  hand,  NMs  containing  carbon  in 
their structure can also increase the HC emission when combined 
with some base fuels [121] . 

CO emission is mostly reduced by NMs addition although nega- 
tive effects can also be observed. A reduction of CO is usually ob- 
served for NMs with higher catalytic activity [ 65 , 80 , 120 ], promoted 
engagement as oxidation catalyst, which converts CO into CO 
2 dur- 
ing the combustion process [ 59 , 112 ], and NMs promoting improved 
secondary atomization [77] . In a few investigations an increase of 
CO emission was reported. For example, if NMs contain oxygenic 
functional groups over carbon quantum dots, the CO emission may 
increase [19] . 

Total PM emissions with respect to NMs usage are rather rarely 
investigated. Unfortunately, practically all NMs, used as fuel addi- 
tives, end up as part of PM in the diesel engine exhaust. Note that 
the NMs in the exhaust gas can be found in either in the orig- 
inal  or  some  transformed  form;  they  can  agglomerate  or  aggre- 
gate to certain degree and they can be embedded in soot. Since 
their  engagement  typically  improves  combustion  and  promotes 
soot oxidation, adequate NMs usage should typically at least some- 
what reduce the total mass of the particulates (PM mass emission) 
[ 77 , 122 ]. This is because the total PM mass reduction due to pro- 
moted soot oxidation usually outweighs the increase of the total 
PM mass due to NMs presence within PM. The observed total PM 
mass variations depend most strongly on NMs type, NMs dosage 
and engine load. Roughly speaking, these variations are typically 
ranged from minor increase to about 10% decrease. If one looks at 
major individual PM ingredients, the reported data suggests that 
the most notable decrease can be observed for elemental carbon. 

Meanwhile,  minor  decrease  can  usually  be  observed  for  organic 
carbon  and  zero  or  minor  increase  can  be  observed  for  water- 
soluble organic carbon [122] . 

In contrast to the mostly positive PM mass variation, NMs en- 
gagement practically unavoidably increases the number of partic- 
ulates (PM count emission) [ 39 , 122 , 123 ]. The range of PM count 
variation depends heavily on many parameters, perhaps the most 
exposed being the NMs type, NMs dosage, and engine load. In fact, 
total PM count variations may range from close to zero up to 10 
or more times of what is obtained with neat base fuel. Due to the 
number of inﬂuencing parameters and lack of research, it is prac- 
tically impossible to outline some consistent and ﬁrm correlations 
between NMs additives and PM count emissions. What can be ob- 
served from current reports, however, are some trends that can be 
outlined as follows: 

(cid:2) Total  PM  count  emission  typically  increases  substantially  al- 
though a slight decrease is also possible; the increase factors 
range from around zero up to 10 or more times of what is ob- 
served for neat base fuel. 

(cid:2) PM count emission usually increases with NMs dosage, but the 
relation is by no way linear; occasionally, a PM count decline 
due to NMs dosage increase can also be observed. 

(cid:2) The  PM  count  emission  increase  is  primarily  due  to  signiﬁ- 
cantly increased number of particulates in the size range below 
50 nm; particulates count in the size range above 50 nm can 
either increase or decrease moderately. 

(cid:2) The most dramatic PM count increase is typically observed at 
lower engine loads; as the engine load increases, the PM count 
increase usually declines. 

It should be noted that by improving combustion and soot ox- 
idation, NMs additives would surely decrease also the PM count 
emission, if themselves would not be a direct source of particu- 
lates. Even if the NMs contain combustible or volatile organic com- 
ponents, after these are burnt or evaporated, the remaining, typ- 
ically  metallic  ingredients,  form  self-nucleated  metallic  particles. 
These self-nucleated particles can then agglomerate and/or further 
coagulate with carbon particles [123] . 

Smoke emission , which is actually a part of PM emission, is usu- 
ally decreased by NMs addition. A reduction is usually observed for 
NMs/base fuel combinations which exhibit reduced ignition delay 
and better fuel/air mixing [ 120 , 124 ] and for NMs with higher cat- 
alytic activity [ 54 , 55 , 59 , 89 , 111 ] and better secondary atomization 
[ 44 , 60 ]. 

Effects on engine components are rather scarcely investigated and 
only a few papers report some ﬁndings derived from engine test- 
ing. According to these results, NMs which have the ability to oxi- 
dize the carbon can potentially have an important role in prevent- 
ing carbon deposits on cylinder walls [ 40 , 92 ]. Besides of this, NMs 
which contribute to increased fuel viscosity may increase fuel ﬁl- 
ter plugging problems at low temperatures and increase wear in 
the  fuel  injection  system  (FIS).  In  the  case  when  NMs  decrease 
fuel  viscosity,  lubrication  of  the  FIS  may  not  be  suﬃcient,  lead- 
ing to greater pump and injector leakage, reducing maximum fuel 
delivery, and thus decreasing power output [ 20 , 125 ]. Furthermore, 
the  activities  and  transformations  of  some  NMs,  for  example  in 
the case of carbon coated aluminum NPs in a blend of diesel fuel 
and biodiesel from palm oil, may result in more ash accumulation 
in the DPF and affect the performance of the after-treatment sys- 
tem and consequently also the diesel engine characteristics [39] . 
More ash accumulation in the DPF requires more frequent clean- 
ing  or  replacement  of  the  DPF.  Unfortunately,  little  seems  to  be 
known so far how exactly the presence of various NMs inﬂuences 
the thermophoretic deposition in the exhaust gas pipes. Namely, 
thermophoresis seems to be the dominant deposition mechanism 
for particles ranging in size roughly from 20 to 50 nm under tem-

makes most particles from NMs additives suitable candidates for 
thermophoretic deposition. In spite of that, no reports on any re- 
lated problems during experimental testing could be found. Maybe, 
this is partially due to the fact that the increase of total PM mass 
emission due to NMs additives is not substantial. But further re- 
search is surely needed here to get more insight into this issue.

The vast abundance of inﬂuencing factors and evaluation crite- 
ria makes the identiﬁcation of best performing nanofuels a deli- 
cate and sophisticated process. To simplify this somewhat, in this 
paper only the most frequently investigated NMs/base fuel pairs 
have been taken into consideration. On top of this, only the best 
performing NMs dosage for a particular NMs/base fuel pair was se- 
lected. The selected NMs/base fuel pairs with the best performing 
dosage and the accompanying relevant data are given in a tabu-

tiﬁed  by  a  unique  case  name .  Furthermore,  the  following  abbre-

In  Table  2  only  nanofuels  with  C  NTs  are  collected,  although 
other  carbon-based  NMs  have  also  been  tested  quite  frequently. 
These other types are graphite oxide nanoparticles (G’O NPs), car- 
bon quantum dot nanoparticles (Cqd NPs), graphene nanoplatelets 
(G  NPTs),  and  graphene  oxide  nanoparticles  (GO  NPs).  Unfortu- 
nately, for these NMs types the published results often reveal only 
selected  diesel  engine  characteristics  which  prevents  estimating 
the fuel performance with respect to all considered characteristics. 
Superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs are a special class of metal 
oxide  nanoparticles  with  unique  magnetic  properties  [144] .  This 
makes  iron  NMs  an  attractive  choice  from  the  view  of  NMs  re- 
moval from the diesel engine exhaust. Namely, a relative simple 
and easy removal process helps substantially in improving various 
ecological issues and possible NMs recovery. 

In order to rank the nanofuels given in Tables 1-8 , one needs 
some kind of a performance measure. In this paper, this measure 
is  based  on  relative  improvements  of  both,  engine  performance 
and emission characteristics. This means that only those nanofu- 
els could be ranked here that fulﬁlled the following criteria: 

(cid:2) The same base fuel was tested with and without NMs addition 

on the same engine under the same conditions, and 

(cid:2) All required data was measured and reported: either only NO x , 
HC,  CO,  and  smoke/PM  emissions,  or,  the  listed  emissions  as 
well as brake speciﬁc fuel consumption and brake thermal eﬃ- 
ciency; the label smoke/PM emission is chosen here instead of 
just PM emission because smoke is by far the most frequently 
measured  part  of  PM  emission  and  usually  the  only  one  re- 
ported; engine power is not included into the ranking because 
the reported variations of power are always practically zero, the 

9 

only exception being the case C-13, where P e,max increased by 
about 7% after addition of C NTs to j B/Bu40 base fuel [64] . 

The fuels fulﬁlling these two requirements are denoted as rank- 
able  in  this  paper.  Note  that,  unfortunately,  because  of  partially 
missing data, some of potentially good performing nanofuels were 
not ranked. 

The  deﬁnition  of  the  performance  measure  is  a  delicate  and 
ambiguous undertaken. For this reason in this work two different 
nanofuel  performance  factors  were  introduced.  The  ﬁrst  one,  ξ
A , 
considers both, engine performance and emission characteristics. 
The other one, ξ
B , focuses solely on emissions. In these factors the 
relative importance of a particular engine performance and emis- 
sion characteristics is speciﬁed by a corresponding weighting fac- 
tor. The choice of these weighting factors is also a vague under- 
taken due to the lack of universally valid and meaningful criteria. 
Anyhow, in this work the ﬁrst performance factor ξ
A , to be used 
as criterion A, was deﬁned as 
ξA = 0 . 1 ψ η

th − 0 . 1 ψ g e − 0 . 25 ψ N O x − 0 . 15 ψ HC − 0 . 15 ψ CO 

i  ( i = η

− 0 . 25 ψ 
Smoke / PM 
where the symbols ψ 
th ,  g e , NO x , HC, CO, smoke/PM) de- 
note signed relative variations of engine characteristics observed 
when  pure  base  fuel  is  replaced  by  the  corresponding  nanofuel. 
The corresponding weighting factor values were chosen intuitively 
to reﬂect the objective priorities. One can see that among the en- 
gine performance characteristics the highest priority was given to 
speciﬁc fuel consumption while among the emissions, the highest 
priorities were given to NO x  and smoke; overall, emissions have 
higher  priority  than  engine  performance.  From  the  performance

The second performance factor ξ

where obviously the highest priorities were assigned again to NO x 
and  smoke.  The  higher  weighting  factors  of  NO x  and  smoke/PM 
emissions reﬂect the fact that NO x and PM (which includes smoke) 
are considered the most harmful diesel engines emissions with re- 
spect to public health. 

Smoke / PM 

A  and  ξ

Both  performance  factors,  ξ

B ,  were  calculated  for  all 
rankable fuels for each criterion. Due to the fact that in the lit- 
erature  the  effects  of  NMs  additives  on  emission  characteristics 
are more frequently investigated than the effects on engine per- 
formance, the number of rankable nanofuels under criterion B is 
higher than the number of rankable fuels under criterion A. More 
precisely, 40 fuels qualiﬁed for criterion A and 52 qualiﬁed for cri- 
terion B; the cases that were ranked only under criterion B are: 
CeC-1, Al-1, Al-7, Al-15, Ce-4, Ce-12, Ti-3, Ti-8, Ti-12, Ti-13, Ti-14, 
and Zn-3. At this point it is important to note that in case Cu-3 
excellent reductions of NO x , HC, and CO emissions up to 45%, 60%, 
and 25% were observed. Unfortunately, for this case the smoke/PM 
emission is not reported, meaning that this potentially promising 
case could not be ranked under any criterion. 

The results for the fuels rankable under criterion A and sorted 
with  respect  to  decreasing  ξ
A  are  given  Table  9 .  Meanwhile, 
Table 10 shows the results for the fuels rankable under criterion 
B and sorted with respect to decreasing ξ
B . As can be seen, the 
most promising fuels with respect to criterion A and criterion B are 
Al

Obviously,  the  nanofuels  of  cases  Al-12,  Al-17,  and  Zn-8  per- 
formed  best  with  respect  to  both  criteria.  In  general,  one  can 
say that both performance factors are roughly linearly correlated, 
meaning that good emission results come in hand in hand with 
good engine performance. This can be best illustrated by drawing

To get a better insight into the best-performing fuels, one may 
be worth to take a look at relative characteristics variations caused 
by NMs additives. For the 10 best-performing fuels ranked under 
criterion A the relative variations ψ 
i ( i = NO x , HC, CO, smoke/PM, 
g e ,  η
th )  are  illustrated  in  Fig.  3 .  One  can  see  that  there  is  one 
case, Zn-8, that deviates from the common pattern. Namely, it is 
the only case with increased NO x emission, which means that its 
ranking would change signiﬁcantly, if the weights in the deﬁnition

of the performance factor would be changed according to different 
preferences. 

For the 10 best-performing fuels ranked under criterion B the 
relative variations ψ 
i  ( i = NO x , HC, CO, smoke/PM) are illustrated 
in Fig. 4 . Here one can observe some very well performing fuels 
(cases CeC-1, Al-1, and Zn-3) which could not be ranked under cri- 
terion A. The engine performance characteristics of these fuels was 
not reported, but if engine performance is not a high priority, these 
fuels would surely be very strong competitors. 

At  this  point  it  is  important  to  note  that  among  the  best- 
performing  fuels,  depicted  in  in  Fig.  3  and  Fig.  4 ,  only  in  cases 
Al-12 and CeC-1 the engine was tested at several engine operating 
regimes  and  the  shown  variations  are  obtained  from  the  results 
averaged over all tested operating regimes. In all other cases, the 
variations are obtained from the data measured at only one engine 
operating regime. 

It is evident from Figs. 3–4 that NO x emission is reduced by ad- 
dition of NMs in all cases, ranked in the ﬁrst ten performing cases 
of Tables 9-10 , except when ZnO NPs are added to the D/ p B30/E30 
base fuel (case Zn-8). In this case, Prabakaran and Udhoji [73] re-

ported that the presence of 250 ppm of ZnO NPs increased the av- 
erage in-cylinder temperature, which ultimately results in higher 
NO x emission, compared to the base fuel. In all other cases, NO x 
reduction is mainly the result of: (i) heat sink effect of Al 
3 NPs 
in D/ jj B20 or in D/ ts B20 base fuel (cases Al-12 and Al-17) [ 68 , 108 ], 
2  NPs  in  j B100  or  in 
(ii)  NO x  reduction  agent  role  of  Al 
D/ j B20 base fuels (cases AlCe-2 and AlCe-1) [ 94 , 107 ] and of TiO 
2 
NPs  in  ci B100  (case  Ti-11)  [59]  by  converting  NO x  into  oxygen 
and  N 
2  during  the  combustion  process.  An  interesting  point  to 
note in Figs. 3-4 is the grave difference in NO x emission variation 
between  cases  Al-12  and  Al-17.  Namely,  in  both  cases  the  same 
NPs  and  rather  similar  base  fuels  (blend  of  diesel  fuel  and  20% 
biodiesel) were used. What is different is the biodiesel type (jojoba 
versus tamarind seed biodiesel), engine type, and operating condi- 
tions. Whatever the most inﬂuencing reason is, such data indicates 
clearly how delicate the process of optimal nanofuel preparation 
and engine setup will be. Furthermore, it is evident from Figs. 3- 
4 that the ZnO NPs usage in cases Zn-8 and Zn-3 has opposite ef- 
fects on NO x emission. This illustrates nicely that the addition of 
the same type of NMs can have different effects on engine char-

acteristics if one or more of the following factors differ: NMs syn- 
thesis method, NMs dosage, base fuel type, nanofuel preparation 
method, and diesel engine type. 

2 O 

Regarding the HC emission, the largest reductions by about 60% 
2 /mwC(DMF) to D/ wco B20 (case CeC- 
were obtained by adding CeO 
1) and Al 
3 NPs to D/ ts B20 (case Al-17) and to D/ jj B20 (case Al- 
12). These reductions are attributed to the reactivity role and cat- 
2 /mwC(DMF) NTs [40] and the sec- 
alytic effect of the engaged CeO 
ondary atomization and catalytic effects of Al 
3 NPs [ 68 , 108 ], re- 
spectively. 

2 O 

The  largest  reduction  of  CO  emission  by  about  80%  was  ob- 
served for the nanofuels ZnO-D/ p B30/E30 (case Zn-8) and Al 
3 - 
D/ jj B20 (case Al-12). This was attributed to the catalytic activity of 
the engaged NPs and enhanced fuel-air mixing in the combustion 
chamber [ 73 , 108 ]. 

2 O 

A  reduction  of  smoke/PM  emission  by  more  than  40%  was 
achieved by addition of ZnO to D/ p B30/E30 (case Zn-8), Al 
3 NPs 
to D/ ts B20 base fuel (case Al-17), and by adding C NTs into j B/Bu40 
(case C-13) and to D/ ts B20 (case C-5). Mostly, this is attributed to 
shorter ignition delay, better fuel/air mixing, as well as to catalytic 
effects of the involved NMs [ 64 , 68 , 73 ]. 

2 O 

As can be seen from Fig. 3 , the most signiﬁcant improvement 
of η
th  and g e  was obtained in cases C-13 and C-8. The addition 
of energetic C NTs to j B/Bu40 and to j B/ tp O10 base fuels increases 
the cetane number and slightly also the fuel caloriﬁc value, lead- 
ing to a more eﬃcient combustion process and consequently to an 
increase of η

th and a decrease of g e [ 24 , 64 ]. 

Under the bottom line, the experimentally obtained results of 
the considered cases show that both, energetic and non-energetic 
NMs, can improve diesel engine characteristics. It is also evident 
that, by considering criterion B, energetic NMs have no privilege 
with respect to non-energetic NMs, while by considering criterion 
A, the energetic NMs showed some beneﬁts only in engine perfor- 
mance characteristics, Fig. 3 . But the results of added C-based en- 
ergetic NMs in cases C-13, C-8, and C-5, presented in Fig. 3 , shows, 
that the NMs combustion (reactivity role) cannot be the sole rea- 
son to improve η
th and g e . Namely, the performance characteristics 
of some non-energetic NMs are better than those of the energetic 
NMs of case C-5. It follows that the NMs reactivity engagement is 
of rather minor importance, which is understandable if one takes 
into  account  the  typically  used  NMs  dosages.  So,  either  one  or 
more of other NMs activities dominate the performance of a par- 
ticular nanofuel. These three activities, in turn, depend strongly on 
NMs type, NMs size and dosage, NMs synthesis method, base fuel 
type and nanofuel preparation method. For example, Al 
3 NPs are 
not reactive at conditions in diesel engine combustion chamber but 
they engage well in other activities such as secondary atomization, 
thermal, and possibly also the catalytic one. This explains why it 
is possible that the best-performing case with respect to criteria A 
and B is the case Al-12, which involves non-energetic Al 
3 NPs. 
This result is in accordance with several comparative experimen- 
tal studies of Al 
3 NPs versus some energetic and non-energetic 
NMs. Those tests were performed at the same conditions by keep- 
ing also the other relevant parameters constant. For example, Raju 
et al. [68] tested Al 
3 NPs and C NTs as fuel additives to D/ ts B20 
base fuel in a single-cylinder diesel engine Kirloskar TV-1/MS-FIS 
at 1500 rpm and full load. Furthermore, Aalam [152] tested Al 
2 O 
3 
4 NPs within the D/ m B20 base fuel in the Kirloskar AV1 
and Fe 
diesel engine with CR-FIS. In both cases the Al 
3 NPs proved to 
be more effective in improving the engine characteristics.

The  laboratory  experiments  published  so  far  conﬁrm  that 
nanofuels  may  offer  a  lot  of  immediately  visible  or  measurable 
beneﬁts.  If  nothing  more,  this  conﬁrms  that  NMs  offer  various 
opportunities worth of investigating possible beneﬁts and practi- 
cal  viability  of  long-term  NMs  usage  as  fuel  additives  in  diesel 
engines.

3. Technical challenges and practical viability 

Till  today,  the  literature  about  practical  viability  of  nanofuels 
usage in diesel engines is rather modest. In spite of this, a careful 
examination of published work reveals some technical challenges 
that need to be addressed and resolved somehow to ensure prac- 
tical  viability  of  nanofuels.  These  challenges  are  related  to  opti- 
mal dosage and sizing of NMs, nanofuels stability, DPF activity and 
durability, and to adequate ECU programming. Moreover, at least 
some basic economy aspects have to be addressed brieﬂy. 

3.1. NMs size and dosage 

Laboratory testing shows that each NMs/base fuel pair requires 
optimal  NMs  size  and  dosage  to  achieve  the  desired  effects  on 
engine characteristics and other relevant parameters [ 18 , 153 ]. For 
example, Kumar et al. [124] warned that in the case of exceeded 
NMs limit dosage, high level of knocking and unstable engine op- 
eration  may  be  observed.  This  is  due  to  changed  physical  and 
chemical  properties  of  the  nanofuel,  which  may  cause  the  fuel 
to  mix  with  air  more  slowly  and  get  ignited  later  if  the  NMs 
dosage is not appropriate. Furthermore, by examining the results 
reported by several researchers [ 89 , 136 ], it can be concluded that 
the  optimal  dosage  of  NMs,  added  to  the  base  fuels,  may  vary 
substantially  with  respect  to  the  operating  regime.  For  example, 
Nour et al. [136] tested various dosages of Al 
3 NPs in the range 
from 25 mg/L to 100 mg/L, added to the blend of diesel fuel, jo- 
joba biodiesel and ethanol. They have shown that the maximum 
brake thermal eﬃciency at medium loads is reached at 25 mg/L 
while at high loads the optimal dosage is 75 mg/L. El-Seesy et al. 
[89]  showed  that  at  various  engine  loads  and  speeds  the  maxi- 
mum reduction of harmful emissions and maximum improvement 
of engine performance requires various dosages of Al 
3  NPs in 
the blend of diesel fuel and jojoba biodiesel. Besides of variable 
dosing, the NMs morphology and particles size are very important 
parameters. Namely, these two parameters inﬂuence to a great ex- 
tent the NMs reactivity, transport, and ultimate fate in the envi- 
ronment [154] . As described in Section 2.1, laboratory engine test- 
ing has conﬁrmed that NMs are more or less transformed during 
their travelling through all diesel engine systems [ 2 , 48 , 87 , 98 ]. This 
transformation depends also to a great extent on the initial size of 
NMs. Consequently, for practical viability reasons, it is very impor- 
tant to select the optimal initial size and dosage of NMs. 

2 O 

2 O 

Keeping the above mentioned in mind, the ideal scenario would 
be  to  feed  each  particular  engine  type  by  optimal  NMs  dosage, 
morphology, and size. From practical point of view, a varying mor- 
phology and size would be diﬃcult to achieve since this would re- 
quire to have various NMs on board. The variable dosing, on the 
other  side,  could  probably  be  easier  achievable,  for  example,  by 
ECU-controlled  NMs  addition  and  mixing  of  NMs  and  base  fuel. 
This solution would require some kind of a mixing device to pre- 
pare the nanofuel on the ﬂy as needed. However, determination of 
the optimal NMs dosage would require extended long-term labora- 
tory testing to determine a viable compromise regarding all aspects 
of diesel engine operation. 

3.2. Nanofuels stability 

The problem of nanofuel stability refers directly to agglomer- 
ation  and  sedimentation of  NMs  dispersed  within  the  base  fuel. 
Namely,  NMs  can  agglomerate  with  time  due  to  their  high  sur- 
face activity and this may even enhance their sedimentation and 
changes  of  thermo-physical  properties  of  nanofuels  like  thermal 
conductivity,  viscosity,  and  density  [ 2 , 21 ].  Saxena  et  al.  [20]  re- 
ported that the long-term stability of nanofuel suspension depends 
on  several  parameters,  a  few  of  the  most  important  being  NMs 

T. Kegl, A. Kova ˇc Kralj, B. Kegl et al. 

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 83 (2021) 100897 

leases the NMs deposited in the soot; it is assumed that most of 
the released NMs particles exit the DPF. This means that the main 
problem for the DPF will be the NMs deposited directly on the DPF 
walls. These deposits cannot be removed by regeneration which re- 
sults in more ash accumulation in the DPF and affects its perfor- 
mance and consequently also the diesel engine characteristics [39] . 
This necessitates the DPF to be cleaned periodically by ﬂushing it 
out with high pressure water and air jets [159] . 

Apart from cleaning the DPF, another potential option would be 
to engage at least somewhat beneﬁcial NMs. Namely, as reported 
some NMs can even increase the catalytic activity of the DPF by ef- 
fectively increasing the catalytically active surface within the DPF 
[ 158 , 160 ]. For these reasons, the effects of each NMs/base fuel pair 
have to be investigated with respect to ﬁltration eﬃciency as well 
as well as with respect to DPF storage capacity and possible ben- 
eﬁcial effects of the NMs deposited within the ﬁlter. Furthermore, 
NMs presence has to be considered in developing new DPFs, espe- 
cially for the most important DPF parameters, such as pore diame- 
ter, wall thickness, cell design and density, and volumetric capacity 
[39] . 

It seems that by optimizing the DPF type, material, pore diam- 
eter, wall thickness, cell design and density, and ﬁlter volumetric 
capacity of the DPF, notable gains are still possible in terms of PM 
emission and DPF eﬃciency and durability. Furthermore, to mini- 
mize NMs release into the environment, a new system to capture 
and remove NMs particles might prove very useful. In general, such 
a new system could be located before or after the DPF, depend- 
ing on the NMs activities in the DPF. If the used NMs have a po- 
tential to reduce soot ignition temperature and help to regenerate 
the ﬁlter, the capture system might be located after the DPF; in 
this case, the fate of the NMs trapped in the DPF depends on dis- 
posal/recycling of the used DPF [161] . Otherwise, if the NMs may 
harm DPF eﬃciency and durability, the capture system should be 
located before the DPF. In either case, magnetic NMs seem to have 
an  important  advantage  against  the  non-magnetic  ones,  because 
the  former  one  can  be  much  easier  collected  from  the  exhaust 
[58] . Namely, for magnetic NMs, a system equipped with perma- 
nent magnets would theoretically do the job although its practical 
implementation would probably not be straightforward. For exam- 
ple, such a system would need to be noninvasive, i.e., it has to be 
without effects on temperature, pressure, and velocity ﬂuctuations 
in  the  diesel  engine  exhaust  system.  Furthermore,  if  NMs  parti- 
cles are captured, the system would also require the particles to 
be removed somehow and possibly reused as fuel additives. Un- 
fortunately, there seem to be no detailed studies on the inﬂuence 
of high temperatures within the cylinder on the magnetic proper- 
ties of the NMs. What the available reports show is that various 
Fe-based NPs, mostly prepared in form of a nanoﬂuid and possi- 
bly shell-coated, more or less preserve their magnetic properties. 
Namely, as reported, substantial parts (up to 50%) of the used par- 
ticles could be captured at the end of the exhaust pipe by engaging 
external permanent magnets [ 58 , 162 , 163 ]. 

3.4. ECU programming 

Most frequently reported nanofuels are tested on engines tuned 
for diesel fuel. But NMs additives may change fuel properties sig- 
niﬁcantly [ 2 , 17 , 20 ], meaning that at least the ECU maps should be 
modiﬁed according to the engaged nanofuel. It is important to note 
that the needed modiﬁcation does not depend just on the chosen 
base fuel/NMs pair, but also on NMs size and dosage. Thus, optimal 
ECU setup is becoming quite a diﬃcult task that requires engage- 
ment of systematic numerical optimization procedures. One such 
somewhat simpliﬁed example of multi response optimization was 
reported by Vellaiyan et al.  [164] , where the optimal content of 
water and soybean biodiesel in diesel fuel as well as optimal value

various scenarios. 

size, NMs dosage, and the nanofuel preparation method. In general, 
smaller  NMs  have  less  weight  which  reduces  the  occurrence  of 
sedimentation and makes the nanofuel more stable [ 20 , 153 ]. More- 
over, the nanofuel preparation method and implementation details 
as well as used surfactants seem to be important reasons for var- 
ious suspension stabilities. Anyhow, to ensure practical viability of 
nanofuels usage in diesel engines, their long-term stability is one 
of the critical issues that must be addressed and resolved [ 2 , 21 ]. 

To prevent fuel stability issues, one would need to (i) use an 
adequate method for particular nanofuel preparation by using suit- 
able  surfactants  or  (ii)  engage  special  systems  to  prevent  depo- 
sition/sedimentation  of  NMs  in  the  fuel  tank.  In  the  latter  case, 
an in-line system, similar to the one for water-in-diesel emulsions 
preparation [155] , might be useful. This system mixes fuel and wa- 
ter from separated tanks on the ﬂy as needed. In our case, the base 
fuel and NMs could be stored separately and the nanofuel could 
be prepared when needed with the NMs dosage being adjusted to 
the current engine operating regime. The fuel preparation could be 
done, for example, by a specialized device containing a high shear 
and an ultrasonic mixer. In this case the nanofuel should be pre- 
pared close to the fuel pump in order to minimize the time period 
needed for the fuel to travel from the point of preparation to the 
combustion chamber. 

3.3. DPF activity and durability 

In  spite  of  scarce  laboratory  experiments,  dealing  with  the 
inﬂuence  of  nanofuels  on  DPF  activity,  eﬃciency,  and  durabil- 
ity  [ 39 , 156–158 ],  it  is  obvious  that  the  NMs  effects  must  not 
be  neglected.  To  put  this  into  proper  perspective,  one  should 
ﬁrst estimate the relative quantity of NMs entering into the ex- 
haust  system.  For  this  purpose  a  reference  value  must  be  se- 
lected and a good candidate for this is the EURO 6 norm for PM 
emission  of  passenger  cars  equipped  with  DPF,  here  denoted  as 
6 = 0.0045 g/km; this is the quantity of PM mass that is allowed 
E 
to pass the DPF ﬁlter and enter the environment. A few scenarios, 
denoted as S x / y , where x is the NMs dosage (in ppm) and y is the 
fuel consumption (in L/100 km), are illustrated in Fig. 5 . For each 
scenario the NMs mass per 1 km (in g/km) is divided by E 
6 to get 
a relative NMs mass measure that enters the exhaust system under 
the assumption that the NMs do not burn. 

It is obvious from Fig. 5 that the NMs mass entering the ex- 
haust system is rather signiﬁcant. Unfortunately, there are practi- 
cally no reports on NMs deposition on exhaust pipes. So, a sim- 
pliﬁed assumption could be that all of the NMs particles enter the 
DPF. Now, since the ﬁltration eﬃciency of the DPF is rather poor 
for particulate sizes below 50 nm [ 98 , 156 ], which is true for the 
usual NMs sizes [ 2 , 39 ], a signiﬁcant amount of NMs will pass the 
DPF. The rest of the NMs deposits either directly on DPF walls or 
within the soot deposits. In the latter case, occasional active re- 
generation of the DPF oxidizes the soot cake into gas which re-

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 83 (2021) 100897 

of ZnO NPs dosage, were determined numerically. The optimiza- 
tion objective was related to the speciﬁc fuel consumption, brake 
thermal eﬃciency, HC, CO and NO x emissions, and smoke opacity; 
these quantities were combined into a single objective function by 
using intuitively chosen weighting factors. At this point it might be 
worth noting that the proper selection of adequate weighting fac- 
tors is a very diﬃcult task because these factors inﬂuence heavily 
the result, but we often have no physically meaningful indicators 
how to scale them. 

Since ECU setup will require modiﬁcations, it should not be too 
hard to introduce the NMs dosage as a very importer parameter of 
the fuel delivered into the cylinder. Namely, NMs dosage inﬂuences 
heavily all engine characteristics, making it a high-priority parame- 
ter to be controlled by the ECU. Of course, technically this will only 
be possible if the engine will be equipped by a corresponding de- 
vice that would enable variable NMs addition on the ﬂy, according 
to current engine operating regime. 

3.5. Economy aspects 

A viable nanofuel engagement can only be achieved if the de- 
rived solutions are also economically sustainable. In this view one 
has to consider at least two important aspects. Firstly, the needed 
engine modiﬁcations and additional engine subsystems will surely 
come with additional cost. Secondly, nanofuels could be more ex- 
pensive than the corresponding base fuels. 

The additional engine cost can hardly be estimated at current 
development  stage;  one  can  hope,  however,  that  this  additional 
cost will not be too harmful once the new engines will enter large- 
scale serial production. Regarding the cost of the fuel, however, the 
data currently available allow for some rough estimates. For this 
purpose, it might be most valuable to take a look at the fuel cost 
ratio F CR , here deﬁned as 

F CR = 

n f 

q 
q

e,nf p 

f = g

nf = g 
nf  is  the  nanofuel  cost  per  unit  of  delivered 
where  q 
amount of work and q 
bf  is the base fuel cost per unit of 
delivered amount of work. Here, the symbol g e denotes brake spe- 
ciﬁc  fuel consumption and  p  is  the  fuel  price per  unit  of  mass; 
the subscripts nf and bf stand for the nanofuel and base fuel, re- 
spectively. By doing some mathematical work and neglecting the 
nanofuel preparation process cost, the ratio F CR can be expressed 
as 

(cid:3)
(cid:2)
1 − μ + μ p nm 
F CR = ( 1 + ψ ) 
b f 

p 

where ψ  is the relative variation of brake speciﬁc fuel consump- 
tion (given in Fig. 3 ), μ is the relative mass share of NMs within 
the nanofuel, and p nm is the NMs price per unit of mass (US Re- 
search Nanomaterials, Inc). 

Based on the currently available prices of base fuels and NMs, 
the  ratio  F CR  was  estimated  for  a  few  of  the  best-performing 
nanofuels shown in Fig. 3 . The results are depicted in Fig. 6 . 

From Fig. 6 one can see that F CR  ratios are mainly below 1.0 
meaning that under favorable conditions a nanofuel could even be 
more cost effective than the corresponding base fuel. It should be 
noted, however, that the input data used for compiling the chart 
in Fig. 6 can vary within relative wide ranges, meaning that the 
outcome may not always be as satisfactory as shown here. 

4. Environmental and health risks 

According  to  laboratory  test  results,  it  is  clear  that  nanofuels 
have a potential to reduce various harmful diesel engine emissions. 
This includes some PM emission, especially smoke (black carbon

particles or soot), offering a possibility to improve at least some 
aspects of urban air quality and mitigate global warming problems 
[165] . On the other side, however, nanofuels almost unavoidably 
increase the PM count emission and may even facilitate the forma- 
tion of self-nucleated metallic particles [ 39 , 122 , 123 ]. Diesel engine 
testing has shown that despite of engaging high eﬃciency DPFs, 
some amount of NMs is always be emitted directly into the envi- 
ronment through the engine exhaust [ 166 , 167 ]. Moreover, the fate 
of NMs trapped in the DPF depends on the DPF disposal/recycling 
procedures,  with  NMs  often  ending  up  as  deposits  on  landﬁlls 
[167] . Therefore, the potential risks of NMs fuel additives have to 
be evaluated from environmental and human health aspects. 

4.1. Environmental aspects 

After leaving the engine exhaust system, NMs may interact with 
air, soil, and water in various ways, Fig. 7 , and they can undergo 
various transformations or alterations, depending on their proper- 
ties and local environment conditions [167] . These transformations 
can be physical (aggregation and/or agglomeration, adsorption, de- 
position),  chemical  (redox  reactions,  dissolution,  and  interaction 
with macromolecules), and biological (biodegradation, biomodiﬁ- 
cations) [168–170] . The extent of these transformations is mainly 
determined by the size, shape, surface coating, and surface chemi- 
cal character of NMs particulates. Furthermore, environmental con- 
ditions of water (pH, light, natural organic matter, ionic strength, 
temperature, organism, and cations), soil (pH, water content, tex- 
ture,  organisms,  ionic  strength,  organic  matter),  and  atmosphere 
(oxygen,  solid  NPs,  ultraviolet  light,  ozone)  also  affect  the  NMs 
transformations [ 168 , 170–174 ]. Unfortunately, despite current lack 
of understanding of the mechanisms involved in NMs transforma- 
tions, it seems that the NMs used as fuel additives will have some 
long-term  effects  on  natural  populations  of  atmospheric,  terres- 
trial, and aqueous organisms, Fig. 7 . It may be worth noting, that 
a relatively low amount of NMs ends in the atmosphere compared 
to soil and water since NMs are quite effectively removed from the 
atmosphere by rainfall, dry deposition, and coagulation with nat- 
ural aerosol particles. Furthermore, there is no diffusive transport 
from water and soil compartments to atmosphere because NMs do 
not evaporate [175] . 

Atmospheric  environment  and  atmospheric  organisms.  After  the 
NMs from engine exhaust are released into the atmosphere, they 
often  tend  to  agglomerate/aggregate  or  undergo  redox  reactions, 
largely  dependent  on  the  properties  of  the  original  engineered 
NMs [170] . In the atmosphere, NMs grow into larger particles that 
act as cloud condensation nuclei and/or contribute to light absorp- 
tion and scattering, which affects global warming processes [176] . 
Organisms in the air can also react with NMs, leading to their bi- 
ological  transformation.  For  example,  iron-oxidizing  bacteria  can 
accelerate zero-valent iron corrosion [170] by converting Fe 2 +  to 
Fe 3 + . Furthermore, after being released into the atmosphere, NMs

take  part  in  the  formation  of  dust  clouds  and  consequently  de- 
grade the quality of air [174] . The exposure to atmospheric NMs 
via inhalation, skin, and plant leaves can have adverse effects on 
health of living organisms. Some laboratory experiments indicate 
that leaves of various plants can uptake and capture NMs from the 
atmosphere, where the accumulated NMs in the plant can cause 
plant damages and further inﬂuence human and animal food safety 
[177] . 

Soil environment and terrestrial organisms. NMs, released into the 
atmosphere,  can  enter  soil  with  atmospheric  precipitation,  sedi- 
mentation in the form of dust, and abscission of leaves, waste dis- 
posal or as a result of anthropogenic activity. Environmental fac- 
tors in soils, such as organic matter, pH, water content, clay min- 
erals, and organisms, can directly or indirectly inﬂuence the pro- 
cesses of sorption, aggregation, agglomeration, and dissolution of 
NMs. This inﬂuences the stability, mobility, and toxicity of NPs in 
the  soil  [ 170 , 178 ]  and  the  exposure  to  these  NMs  can  have  ad- 
verse  health  effects  on  living  organisms  [ 178 , 179 ].  For  example, 
exposure to Ag NPs may change microbial biomass and diversity, 
decrease  plant  growth  and  inhibit  soil  invertebrate  reproduction 
[180] . Bundschuh et al. [181] reported that plants exposed to CeO 
2 
NPs in their parental generation show response in the ﬁlial genera- 
tion with implications in the grains’ nutrient composition, growth, 
2 NPs, it has been reported that clay 
and physiology. Regarding CeO 
fraction facilitates retention of CeO 
2  NPs in soils by forming ag- 
gregates of bigger size; meanwhile, organic matter promotes the 
2 NPs by coating the particles and decreasing ag- 
availability of CeO 
gregation [170] . NMs in soil can change the gene expression, bio- 
chemistry, physiology, and hence morphology of a plant. For ex- 
ample, ZnO  NPs  and  C  NTs  have the  ability  to  penetrate  tissues 
of roots and seeds of Solanum lycopersicum through disrupting the 
3 O 
plant surface [182] . Tripathi et al. [182] reported also that Fe 
4 

NPs  can  disturb  the  respiration  by  blocking  aquaporins;  Ag  NPs 
can induce oxidative stress and modify the nutritional value; CeO 
2 
NPs can decrease light absorption; CuO NPs can cause toxicity by 
entering  a  cell  membrane  and  releasing  Cu  ions  inside  the  cell. 
Meanwhile,  TiO 
2 ,  ZnO,  NiO,  and  CuO  NPs  can  produce  free  OH 
radicals, which can damage virtually all types of macromolecules. 
Furthermore, TiO 
2 NPs can damage DNA and reduce transpiration 
rate while mwC NTs can condense chromatin inside the cytoplasm 
and cause cell death. Forstner et al. [183] demonstrated, that car- 
bon based NMs can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence soil bacterial community 
composition. 

Water environment and aquatic organisms. Atmospheric NMs can 
enter water with atmospheric depositions or as a result of anthro- 
pogenic  activity.  Environmental  conditions,  such  as  water  chem- 
istry, pH, ionic strength, and the presence of natural organic mat- 
ter  inﬂuence  the  processes  of  NMs  transformation,  such  as  ag- 
gregation, sulﬁdation, and dissolution [ 168 , 172 ]. The exposure  to 
these  NMs  can  have  adverse  health  effects  on  aquatic  organ- 
isms - microbes, algae and plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates 
[ 168 , 172 , 184 ]. NMs can impose toxicity to microbial and algal com- 
munities  mainly  through  changing  the  community  compositions, 
diversities or activities, and decreasing biomass [170] . Zhang et al. 
[170] reported that the viability, growth, morphology, and reactive 
oxygen species production in bacteria and algae are commonly af- 
fected by metallic NPs. For example, the oxidation of Ag NPs in 
aquatic systems largely enhances antimicrobial effects, resulting in 
higher bacterial death than compared to the original engineered 
Ag NPs treatment. On the other hand, they shown that the highest 
toxicity of ZnO NPs in microalgae occurred in the early aging stage 
(due to zinc ion release), while the overall toxicity reduced with 
longer aging time when less toxic hydrozincite and zinc hydrox- 
2 NPs can undergo 
ide were formed. They reported also that MnO

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 83 (2021) 100897 

spect to their effect on organ damage and diseases by Cassee et al. 
[166] . It was reported that the size and shape of CeO 
2 NPs deter- 
mine the solubility and thereby the possibility of the NMs uptake 
in the cells of the respiratory tract. Other studies have found that 
addition of iron NPs to diesel fuel increases inﬂammatory effects 
[160] while the addition of Ag, Fe 0  and SiO 
2  NPs and swCN NTs, 
can induce inﬂammation and pulmonary toxicity [ 189 , 190 ]. 

Cellular and genetic effects. Exposure of human epithelial cells 
to diesel particulates has been found to cause alterations in the 
global  gene  expression  with  a  broad  range  of  biochemical  path- 
ways. It seems that this can be attributed to the changes in the 
physicochemical characteristics of diesel particulates, caused by the 
nanofuels [122] . Some nanofuels have a potential to increase cy- 
totoxicity of emitted particulates. This was observed when using 
Ag NPs in tests with human macrophage and lung ﬁbroblasts and 
when  using  SiO 
2  NPs  with  human  bronchoallveolar  derived  cell 
[190] . Kabir et al. [174] reported that ZnO NPs reduce cell viability 
and increase DNA damage in human bronchoallveolar carcinoma- 
derives cells and in human lung ﬁbroblast cells. Furthermore, the 
addition of iron NPs to low-sulfur diesel fuel seems to decrease 
mutagenic potentials [160] and several metallic and metallic oxide 
NMs seem to have the ability induce genotoxicity [189] . 

Biochemical  changes.  Several  metallic  NMs  and  metallic  oxide 
NMs  induce  oxidative  stress  [ 160 , 189 ].  Oxidative  stress  was  also 
observed by using C NTs when testing human cell lines, by using 
2 NPs in tests with human bronchoallveolar-derived cell and by 
SiO 
2 NPs with bone-marrow-derived macrophages [190] . Fur- 
using TiO 
thermore,  SiO 
2  NPs,  tested  with  human  bronchoallveolar-derived 
cell, induce lipid peroxidation [190] . Kabir et al. [174] reported that 
ZnO NPs cause lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress in human 
bronchoallveolar carcinoma-derives cells. 

Under the bottom line, NMs obviously induce various risks to 
human health and adequate measures or criteria would be needed 
in order to estimate their toxicity in practical applications. Martin 
& Sarkar [191] made a valuable step in this direction by studying 
the inﬂuence of metal NPs on human alveoral cells. According to 
their ﬁndings, the NPs discussed in this paper can be sorted by de- 
creasing human toxicity as follows: CuO > ZnO > Al 
2 > 
γ -Fe 
3 . However, more lengthy and more detailed studies would 
obviously be needed in order to evaluate more precisely the health 
hazards associated with NMs engagement as diesel engine fuel ad- 
ditives.

5. Key topics of future fundamental research 

Among other things, this review exposed clearly the following 
two ﬁndings. Firstly, there is no doubt that NMs additives for diesel 
engine  fuels  have  a  potential  to  deliver  signiﬁcant  beneﬁts;  and 
secondly, the experimental data gathered depend on a wide range 
of parameters (related to engine type and set-up, engine operat- 
ing conditions, base fuel properties, and behavior and properties 
of  NPs),  which  makes  the  extraction  of  general  conclusions  and 
guidelines virtually impossible. The latter ﬁnding is a clear indica- 
tion that much more fundamental research will be needed in order 
to get more insight into the most important physical and chemical 
processes that impact the nanofuel performance. This section aims 
at providing a summarized outlook at what might be perhaps the 
most important fundamental research topics to be addressed in the 
near future. 

Secondary atomization. Probably the most important fundamen- 
tal  processes,  paving  way  for  secondary  atomization  of  a  fuel 
droplet, are the 

(cid:2) Disruption by Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) and Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) 

instabilities, and 
(cid:2) Internal boiling.

photo-catalyzed redox reactions to induce dissolution or generate 
reactive oxygen species. Turan et al. [172] reported that NMs in- 
duce  a  concentration  dependent  increase  in  the  reactive  oxygen 
level  species,  reduction  in  the  aquatic  plant  growth  parameters, 
and the photosynthetic pigment accompanied by an increased ac- 
tivity of some oxidative stress enzyme. Regarding the aquatic inver- 
tebrates, NMs may cause behavioral and physiological changes in 
heart rate, swimming velocity, vertical migration and algal feeding 
rate [172] . A long-term exposure of aquatic vertebrates to NMs may 
result also in lipid peroxidation in the brain of ﬁsh, cellular damage 
and necrosis, and in the damage of the gills and liver [ 172 , 185 ]. 

4.2. Human health aspects 

Nanofuels have not yet been widely used over longer time pe- 
riods.  Therefore,  the  inﬂuence  of  NMs  fuel  additives  on  human 
health is most frequently investigated either by in-vivo or by in- 
vitro studies. In-vivo studies suffer from ethical concerns, they are 
expensive, and usually cannot be performed with a high number 
of individuals that would be necessary to overcome the problem of 
inter-individual variation. Therefore, in spite of some ﬂaws, in-vitro 
studies are indispensable due to their high potential for standard- 
ization, high eﬃciency, low cost, and absence of ethical concerns 
[186] . 

Recent research has ampliﬁed rather serious concerns related 
to the safety of NMs usage and the possible long-term adverse ef- 
fects on human health [187] due to NMs high chemical reactivity 
and biological activity. NMs particles are able to cross biological 
membranes and access cells, tissues, and organs that larger-sized 
particles normally cannot. Furthermore, they can gain access to the 
blood stream via penetration through skin, inhalation, ingestion of 
water and food, leading to both genotoxicity and biochemical toxi- 
city [ 172 , 182 , 188 ]. Human exposure to these NMs leads to a num- 
ber of effects including organ damages and diseases, cellular and 
genetic effects, and biochemical changes [188] . Perhaps the most 
exposed human health implications [ 187 , 188 ], associated with ex- 
posure to NMs, are presented in Fig. 8 . 

Organ  damage  and  diseases.  Recent  in-vitro  and  in-vivo  stud- 
ies  show  that  NMs  can  accumulate  in  various  organs,  especially 
in brain, lungs, and liver, and have the potential to cause differ- 
ent health risks. Hochella et al. [176] reported, that some metallic 
NMs can enter the brain directly through the olfactory bulb. For 
example,  metallic  Fe 
4  NPs  were  founded  in  human  brain  tis- 
sue and are thought to have potentially negative effects on brain 
health. Various metallic NMs have the capability to damage lung 
2 NPs, 
tissues by producing reactive oxygen species [154] . The CeO 
very frequently used as fuel additive, were investigated with re-

Both processes induce various subsequent processes and events 
(most  notably  droplet  shape  deformations  and  oscillations)  that 
may inﬂuence signiﬁcantly the overall atomization process [192- 
196] . 

The mechanically induced RT and KH instabilities develop due 
to the inertia effects and drag forces, which includes also the shear 
forces caused by the velocity ﬁeld of the surrounding gas. These in- 
stabilities may manifest themselves in a wide range of processes, 
starting with less intensive ones such as minor droplet corruga- 
tions, internal ﬂuid circulation, and even incessant pinching off of 
daughter droplets. Experimental results clearly show that the pres- 
ence of NPs may increase droplet susceptibility to shape deforma- 
tions and oscillations induced by various disturbances, which may 
even lead to a catastrophic breakup of the droplet [193] . This, how- 
ever, may depend heavily on many parameters, ranging from fuel 
type to NPs properties and surrounding conditions. In this context, 
current  knowledge  seems  to  be  far  from  satisfactory  and  much 
more  fundamental  research  will  be  needed  here  to  identify  the 
key mechanisms of NPs involvement into these phenomena. What 
makes things very diﬃcult here are the environment as well as the 
time and length scales considered: diesel engine fuel is injected 
at pressures up to 300 MPa at velocities reaching up to 650 m/s 
into a compressed air swirl within a pre-heated combustion cham- 
ber to produce fuel droplets of the size roughly about 30 microns 
and a lifespan of a few milliseconds. This is dramatically different 
to most of the ongoing experimental work done on burning fuel 
droplets: timespans roughly around 1 s and droplet sizes around 
1 mm. Moreover, experiments are mostly conducted at relatively 
calm conditions in contrast to the highly violent environment en- 
countered in the combustion chamber. 

The  thermally  induced  internal  boiling  leads  to  inception  of 
bubbles,  which  may  travel,  grow,  and  coalesce.  This  may  lead 
to  a  full  spectrum  of  events  ranging  from  intermittent  bubble 
ejections  from  the  droplet  surface  to  bubble  expansion  within 
the  droplet  and  possible  micro-explosion,  causing  a  catastrophic 
droplet  breakup.  A  bubble  ejection  leaves  a  void  region  on  the 
droplet  surface;  this  leads  to  a  formation  of  a  liquid  ligament, 
which  may  experience  Rayleigh-Plateau  break-up  of  the  tip,  re- 
sulting in ejection of daughter droplets. After that, the rest of the 
ligament retracts and represents another important source of fur- 
ther droplet shape oscillations and deformations. Experimental re- 
sults show clearly that internal boiling can be heavily affected by 
the presence of NPs. First of all, NPs provide ebullition nucleation 
sites; secondly, NPs can substantially increase radiation heat ab- 
sorption, and ﬁnally, they may notably increase thermal conduc- 
tivity of the fuel. All this may signiﬁcantly inﬂuence bubble incip- 
ience and growth dynamics. Unfortunately, current knowledge is 
here also insuﬃcient, especially regarding the volumetric heating 
due to radiation. Furthermore, the manifestation of these processes 
depends heavily on the droplet size and experimental work is typ- 
ically conducted on droplets being orders of magnitude larger than 
the droplets found in the combustion chamber. Thus, bubble incip- 
ience and ejections for a droplet of a size as found in the diesel 
engine combustion chamber would need experimental investiga- 
tion to boost fundamental research and get more insight into these 
phenomena. 

Heat  transfer .  In  order  to  explain  droplet  evaporation  and  at- 
omization dynamics, perhaps the most important key phenomenon 
that needs to be understood clearly is the heat transfer. Although 
heat transfer properties of nanoﬂuids attracted quite some atten- 
tion  in  the  last  two  decades,  there  still  seems  to  be  no  com- 
pletely  clear  and  undisputed  explanation  of  all  involved  mecha- 
nisms [ 197 , 198 ]. Among the heat transfer modes, the most inves- 
tigated one is heat conduction, which is followed by heat convec- 
tion under circumstances typical in many industrial applications. 
With regard to this, a fuel droplet, living for a few milliseconds in 

the combustion chamber, is a quite different story. First of all, the 
length and time scales are very different to those typically used 
in experimental work. Thus, although the most important mech- 
anisms  responsible  for  heat  transfer  variations  (as  compared  to 
the neat base ﬂuid) seems to be the (i) Brownian motion of NPs, 
(ii) NPs clustering phenomenon, and (iii) NPs/base ﬂuid interface 
layer formation, it is not clear how much relevance exactly these 
mechanisms  show  within  the  length  and  time  scales  as  well  as 
the surrounding conditions (especially, high temperature) encoun- 
tered by a nanofuel droplet in the combustion chamber. Secondly, 
heat convection is typically studied for situations completely dif- 
ferent  to  the  processes  relevant  for  a  droplet;  within  a  droplet, 
micro convection processes resulting from internal ﬂuid/NPs circu- 
lation, due to either bubble formation, droplet shape oscillations, 
or severe shear forces induced by the surrounding gas ﬂow, might 
be important. And thirdly, within a combustion chamber the third 
heat transfer mode, namely radiation, may also contribute substan- 
tially to the atomization dynamics. Namely, under suitable circum- 
stances, volumetric heating may create local hotspots around suﬃ- 
ciently large NPs or their agglomerates [193] ; this may signiﬁcantly 
affect bubble incipience and their further development. 

Catalytic activity . It is well established that NPs are able to ex- 
hibit extraordinary catalytic activity mainly due to their large spe- 
ciﬁc surface. As such, they are potentially capable to deliver eﬃ- 
cient heterogeneous catalysis with high activity and selectivity. 

The results assembled in this review clearly indicate possible 
beneﬁts of the NPs catalytic activity in the diesel engine combus- 
tion chamber and the exhaust system. However, from the exper- 
iments  and  the  accompanying  explanations  published  in  the  lit- 
erature, one can isolate perhaps the main two issues that would 
surely need more insight and fundamental research. These two is- 
sues are: 

(cid:2) Firstly, the kinetics and underlying mechanisms involved in the 
NPs catalytic activity, including the evolution of key intermedi- 
ates and ﬁnal products, and 

(cid:2) Secondly,  the  potential  synergistic  effects  resulting  from  ade- 
quate NPs functionalization, mainly by incorporating adequate 
dopants into the structure of the catalytic support NPs. 

These  two  issues  are  currently  investigated  both,  numerically 
and experimentally. Numerical research relies heavily on the prin- 
ciple of ReaxFF force ﬁeld [199] , which is capable to deliver im- 
pressive results. For example, a recent research exposed rather sur- 
prising reactive and catalytic behavior of Al2O3 NPs, which are of- 
ten considered to be fully inert [31] . On the other hand, experi- 
mental work is also indispensable, for example, in investigating the 
basic mechanisms involved in catalytic activities of more sophis- 
ticated doped and functionalized NPs. As experimental work sug- 
gests, objective-oriented NPs functionalization by using adequate 
interparticle linkers and dopants may deliver remarkable synergis- 
tic effects [200] . This means that by knowing well the main funda- 
mental underlying mechanisms, it would be theoretically possible 
to  systematically  synthesize  highly  eﬃcient  NPs  with  controlled 
behavior. 

6. Conclusions 

In recent years NMs fuel additives proved to offer many oppor- 
tunities in improving diesel engine characteristics. Laboratory tests 
show  that  adequate  NMs  fuel  additives  typically  improve  brake 
thermal eﬃciency and reduce speciﬁc fuel consumption, CO, un- 
burned  HC,  smoke  and  PM  mass  emissions.  Unfortunately,  NO x 
emission can increase in some cases while PM count emission is 
typically increased. In any case, engine characteristics depend to a 
great extent on NMs type, size, and dosage, which affects nanofuel 
properties and NMs activities and transformations during their life

frequently tested NMs, two performance factors have been deﬁned 
and evaluated for individual NMs/base fuel pairs.

The ﬁrst factor considers all diesel engine characteristics (crite-

mance is delivered by: Al

of size 20 nm and a dosage of 60 ppm and ZnO-D/ p B30/E30 with

to criterion A, these three nanofuels are followed by Al

forming nanofuels, including the absolutely best-performing fuel, 
contain Al 
3  NPs. These NPs seem to exhibit moderate toxicity, 
which appears to be less than the toxicity of, e.g., ZnO and espe-

3 NPs are surely 
strong candidates for one of the most promising nanomaterials for 
diesel engine fuel additives.

In order to make NMs additives a viable option, however, it is 
crucial to make nanofuels usage acceptable in the short and long 
term from technical, economical, environmental, and human health 
aspects. From the technical view, attention has to be focused on 
investigations of: (i) optimal size and dosage of NMs, (ii) advanced 
nanofuel preparation methods and surfactants to assure long-term 
stable, homogeneous, and aggregation-free suspensions, (iii) com- 
parative characterization of engineered NMs and their correspond- 
ing emission particulates (after they leave the engine exhaust sys- 
tem) in order to determine precisely their transformations during 
their lifetime in a diesel engine, (iv) studies of needed modiﬁca- 
tions of the ECU programming parameters and data maps, espe- 
cially, injection timing, injection pressure, injection duration, and 
injection rate, in order to assure optimal engine characteristics, (v) 
development  of  eﬃcient  engine  subsystems  to  assure  the  deliv- 
ery  of  optimal  (NMs  dosage)  and  homogenous  nanofuel  suspen- 
sions into the combustion chamber at various operating conditions, 
(vi) development of advanced DPFs with high capability to capture 
NMs-related particulates, and (vii) investigation of technically pos- 
sible options to extract and eventually recycle NMs-related partic- 
ulates from the exhaust system. Regarding the economy, the only 
thing that can currently be estimated is the nanofuel cost. If this 
cost is measured per unit of delivered work, nanofuels could po- 
tentially be even more cost effective than the base fuels. From the 
environmental and human health aspects, attention has to be fo- 
cused on: (i) investigations of transformations of NMs-related par- 
ticulates during their lifetime in the atmosphere, soil, and aqueous 
systems, (ii) NMs effects on atmospheric, terrestrial, and aquatic 
environments and organisms, and (iii) comparative health effects 
assessment of diesel emissions generated with and without NMs 
fuel additives. These studies will require full attention in the future 
in  order  to  prevent  eventual  damaging  long-term  consequences 
and to assure safe engagement of valuable NMs additives.
