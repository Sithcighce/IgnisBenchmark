Lithium-ion cells currently power almost all electronic devices and power tools; they are a key enabling
technology for electric vehicles and are increasingly considered to be the technology of choice for grid
storage. In line with this increased applicability, there is also an increase in the development of new
commercial lithium-ion cell technologies that incorporate innovative functional components (electrode
material compositions and electrolyte formulations) and designs, leading to a diverse range of perfor-
mance characteristics. The uniqueness of each technology in-turn gives rise to unique evolutions of cell
performance as the cell degrades because of usage. Non-destructively measuring and subsequently track-
ing the evolution of lithium-ion cell characteristics is valuable for both industrial engineers and academic
researchers. To proceed in this regard, stakeholders have often devised their own procedures for char-
acterising lithium-ion cells, typically without considering unification, comparability or compatibility. This
makes the comparison of technologies complicated. This comprehensive review for the first time has
analysed and discusses the various international standards and regulations for the characterisation and
electrical testing of lithium-ion cells, specifically for high-power automotive and grid applications.

1. Introduction

The availability of affordable, cost effective energy and power-
dense  lithium-ion  (Li-ion)  cells  is  changing  many  industries.  In
comparison to lead-acid cells which have energy densities in the
region  of  33–42 Wh/kg  and  50–70 Wh/L,  power-densities  of  up
to  180 W/kg  and  lifetimes  of  between  200  and  300  cycles  [1,2] ,
modern Li-ion cells have significantly better energy densities up
2 /graphite  cells)  [2,3] ,  power
to  250 Wh/kg  (450 Wh/L  for  LiCoO
densities  up  to  30 0 0 W/kg  for  lithium  iron  phosphate  (LiFePO
4 )
(LFP)/graphite cells [2,4] and cycle life in excess of 20,0 0 0 cycles
for cells with lithium titanate (Li
12 ) negative electrodes [5,6] .

These features have driven Li-ion batteries to become the preferred
solution for electrical energy storage. It is forecasted that across
the automotive, consumer electronics and grid storage sectors, the
demand for Li-ion batteries will grow from 61 GWh in 2015 to 124
GWh in 2020 [7] .

The  continuous  advances  in  Li-ion  cell  technology,  for  exam-
ple, advances in electrode material, electrolyte design and cell de-
sign, means that cell characterisation tests are necessary to com-
pare  the  capability  and  track  the  evolution  of  performance  over
cell life. Such tests should provide useful and comparative data and
be  repeatable.  In  addition,  it  is  just  as  important  to  understand
their limitations. Typically, three parameters: cell capacity, resis-
tance and open circuit voltage (OCV) are used to define the elec-
trical performance of Li-ion cells. Cell capacity tests are used to
define the maximum capacity in applications under a given load,
while OCV tests provide key information on the thermodynamic
properties of a cell. Resistance tests on the other hand, characterise
cell dynamics. These tests are used to both characterise initial cell
capabilities and quantify cell degradation through “reference per-
formance tests’ (RPT). The vast majority of battery engineers cur-
rently quantify ageing via loss of cell capacity (capacity fade) and
increased cell resistance (power fade). The methods employed for
capacity, resistance and OCV tests are not concurrent, i.e. there are
multiple ways to measure capacity, impedance and OCV, and there
is no ‘one size fits-all’ approach. Fundamentally, the appropriate-

ness of a test depends on what the investigator is studying. The
aim of this work is to present a comprehensive and critical review
of the existing methods for cell characterisation with the objective
of empowering the reader to make an informed decision on the
most appropriate suite of tests for their application.

Previous works on reviewing characterisation standards, such as
the work of Mulder et al. [8] , focussed on the comparability of the
results obtained from implementing different testing standards. In
this work, the focus is on educating the reader on the subtle dif-
ferences between the various methods of characterisation and to
include tests relevant to commercial cells. We restrict this review
to non-invasive dynamic and thermodynamic tests; readers inter-
ested in post-mortem tests are directed to the recent reviews by
Waldmann et al. [9] and Lu et al. [10] and for in-situ techniques
Harks et al. [11] .

2. Capacity tests

In the simplest terms, capacity is a measure of the total electric
charge stored in a cell. This is governed by the amount of active
material available for intercalation (electrodes) [12] . As a cell loses
lithium inventory and/or active material, the capacity of the cell
reduces. In an automotive context, this reduction in cell capacity
reflects a reduction in the maximum driving range of an electric
vehicle. Cell capacity, therefore, is a convenient metric for defining
the state of health (SoH) of a Li-ion cell [5,13–16] .

2.1. Capacity test methodologies

The  established  method  of  measuring  a  cell’s  capacity  is  to
first fully charge and then discharge the cell. During the discharge
step, the time integration of current in Ah is recorded by Coulomb
counting. The most commonly adopted method for charging a bat-
tery  is  via  the  constant-current  constant-voltage  profile  with  a
low current cut-off (typically less than 10% of the constant-current
value) for the constant-voltage part. Although the continuous dis-
charge  of  a  cell  using  a  constant  current  is  the  most  common

method, methods for discharging a cell can vary widely [17,18] . Be-
yond the simplicity of interpreting the results, this method has the
advantage of less variability over other methods because: (i) the
test is easily repeatable, (ii) the Coulomb counting method is sub-
ject to less current measurement errors (over constant power pro-
files, for example) and (iii) variability in resistive heat losses are
better defined.

The measured capacity of a cell is dependent on the operational
conditions under which the cell is tested; namely, the temperature
and charge–discharge profile. Within the Butler–Volmer framework
of Eq. (1) used to describe the reaction rates in electrodes, a higher
discharge rate (which equates to a higher electrode current density,
i ) leads to a larger overpotential, i.e. the difference between the
electrode potential and equilibrium potential,  η, as expressed by

and cathodic charge transfer coefficients, respectively, F is the Fara-
day constant and R is the universal gas constant. Since the equi-
librium  potential  reduces  with  the  state-of-charge  (SoC)  and  in-
ternal resistance of the cell increases with the SoC, overpotentials
at a low SoC progressively become higher causing a cell’s voltage
to reach the lower voltage limit before all the stored capacity in
the cell is released. Therefore, the accessible capacity of a cell de-
creases as the current rate increases [19] .

Higher temperatures cause both ion mobility and solid-state dif-
fusion to improve, thus reducing a cell’s internal impedance and
overpotential.  This  means  that  a  cell  can  discharge  more  capac-
ity before the lower voltage limit is reached. The opposite is true
for  colder  temperatures.  In  addition,  at  lower  temperatures,  the
electrolyte  is  more  viscous  and  ion  transport  properties  are  re-
duced [21] , setting a lower limit on performance and consequently
a lower capacity.

Because cell capacity is dependent on testing conditions, inter-
national  cell  testing  standards  suggest  testing  at  different  ambi-
ent conditions and discharge rates. Although this provides a guide-
line, the research community has pushed the boundaries of test-
ing further, partly to cater to automotive applications. A review of
constant-current capacity tests both within the academic literature
and industrial standards is presented in this subsection.

Fig.  1  summarises  the  various  continuous  discharge  currents
and temperatures suggested for cell capacity tests. Most test stan-
dards,  as  well  as  the  research  community,  suggest  to  perform  a
1C or C/3 capacity test at 25 °C. C-rate is defined as the current
value which will discharge a battery from a fully charged state to
a fully discharged state in 1 h; in battery testing it is commonly de-
fined as the current value equal to the rated capacity (Ah) of a cell,
which may not always be true. In reality, the 1C or C/3 rate is arbi-
trary and has little electrical or electrochemical significance; it has
likely been adopted as a baseline test rate relative to which results
of other C-rates are often compared. To investigate new electrode
designs in novel energy storage material research and similar re-
search, current per unit of electrode surface area (A/cm 2 ) is used,
which allows a direct comparison; this cannot be achieved with C-
rates. However, A/cm 2 cannot be used with most commercial cells
as electrode surface areas are not known; therefore, despite its ad-
vantages, the C-rate is used.

The IEC 62,660–1 standard [22] employs only one C-rate which
differs depending on the application: C/3 for electric vehicles and
1C for hybrid electric vehicles. The International Organization for
Standardization (ISO) published a two-part standard: the first part,
ISO 12,405–1 [23] for high-power applications and the second part,
ISO 12,405–2 [24] for high-energy applications. Although the main
scope of these two parts are for battery packs, the ISO has sug-
gested that they can also be used for cell testing. For high-power
applications, the ISO 12,405–1 standard suggests using 1C, 10C or
the  maximum  C-rate  suggested  by  the  manufacturer.  For  high-
energy applications, the ISO 12,405–2 standard proposes the use
of C/3, 1C, 2C or the maximum C-rate for discharge capacity tests.
In the FreedomCAR battery test manual [25] prepared for the U.S.
Department of Energy, a 1C current is suggested. In contrast, the
most recent U.S. Department of Energy standard [26] suggests re-
placing the 1C-rate with a value relevant to the designed battery
pack; the actual value is scaled from 10 kW constant power for a
standard  pack.  This  pack-level rate  can  be  scaled  down  for  cell-
level testing depending on the number of cells in a pack; there-
fore, the actual rate is not fixed for all types of cells but depends
on the pack requirement. The standard QC/T 743) proposed by the
People’s Republic of China advises the use of a base C/3 rate and
an additional test at 1.5C for high energy and 4C for high power
applications [27] .

To contextualise the discharge rates suggested by the six stan-
dards, consider that analysis of motorway driving (average 70 mph)
for the Tesla Model X electric vehicle (100-kWh battery pack, 295

EPA range) highlights an average discharge rate of around C/4; the
corresponding value for the Nissan Leaf (40-kWh battery pack, 151
EPA range) is around C/2. A significant drawback of using C-rates
that are different to the C-rates identified through the analysis of
the  application  (by  a  factor  of  two  or  more)  is  the  eventuality
of premature/delayed labelling of end of life, even though it may
not be fit for purpose. This is because of the convoluted sensitiv-
ity  of  capacity  measurements  to  C-rates  through  cell  impedance
and heating [28] . Therefore, a more helpful approach for defining
C-rates to be used for capacity measurements is to use the root-
mean-square of cell current in an application.

There  is  a  large  variation  of  temperatures  suggested  for  ca-
pacity tests in the literature. The IEC 62,660–1 standard suggests
the  use  of  0 °C,  25 °C  and  45 °C  as  representative  of  low,  aver-
age  and  high  operating  temperatures  of  a  vehicle,  respectively.
While  both  the  ISO  12,405–1  and  ISO  12,405–2  standards  sug-
gest  measuring  capacity  from  as  low  as  −20 °C  to  a  maximum
of 40 °C, the QC/T 743–2006 standard [27] pushes the maximum
temperature  limit  higher  to  55 °C.  In  the  context  of  electric  ve-
hicles  and  hybrid  electric  vehicles,  operational  temperatures  can
range between −30 °C and 55 °C. During operation, most thermal
management systems will employ a thermal management strategy
which limits the temperature to a value typically between 30 °C
and 35 °C, which is assumed for all technologies to be the opti-
mum  limiting  temperature  for  performance  and  lifetime  [29,30] .
However, the cells will be exposed to extreme temperatures while
parked and not thermally managed. Therefore, testing for capac-
ity  at  −30 °C  and  40 °C  is  perhaps  necessary  to  understand  the
operational  limits  for  electric  vehicle  and  hybrid  electric  vehicle
applications.

As previously mentioned, colder temperatures limit ion mobil-
ity  and  the  accessible  capacity  of  a  cell.  An  extreme  combina-
tion of C-rate and temperature is therefore the 10C-rate at −20 °C

suggested  in  Refs.  [5,31,32] .  Under  these  conditions,  most  Li-ion
cells, with the exception of those containing lithium titanate ox-
ide, Li
12 , as a negative electrode, are unable to sustain large
currents [33,34] for safety reasons and the risk of dendrite lithium
platting at the carbonaceous negative electrode to short circuit a
cell [34] . In addition, a capacity value measured with a high dis-
charge rate at a low temperature may not represent the capacity
value at that test temperature. The cell temperature will be much
higher than the test temperature because of self-heating; for a 10C
discharge test at −10 °C, the cell temperature can rise to 45 °C by
the end of discharge [35] .

It is worth highlighting that the general envelope of tempera-
tures and currents outlined in cell testing standards coincide with
the scientific literature. Key differences are that the scientific lit-
erature  include  tests  at  higher  ( > 1C)  charging  rates  and  have  a
larger concentration of tests at lower ( < C/3) discharge rates. These
differences reflect improvements in cell performance and the de-
velopment of new analysis techniques (as discussed in later sec-
tions).

2.2. Application of constant-current capacity tests for modelling

Li-ion battery models can be divided into three broad groups:
electrochemical models based on underlying electrochemical the-
ory [36–38] , semi-empirical models which exploit a combination
of data and analogies with other physical systems and data-driven
approaches which employ statistical techniques to learn from data
directly  without  relying  on  rules-based  programming.  A  detailed
review  of  each  modelling  approach  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this
work; readers are directed to [39] .

The  most  established  electrochemical  battery  model  is  the
model  proposed  by  Doyle,  Fuller,  and  Newman  (DFN)  [36] .  The
framework is widely used within the battery community and has

not been significantly modified in the last two decades. Given the
difficulty in measuring some of the fundamental parameters of the
model  for  a  commercial  cell,  many  authors  use  parameter  esti-
mation techniques to estimate model parameters using constant-
current discharge curves [40–42] . Despite the issues surrounding
unique  identifiability  of  model  parameters  because  of  the  rela-
tively  large  number  of  unknown  parameters  in  the  model  dis-
cussed in [43,44] , fitting data from constant-current load tests to
extract model parameters for the DFN model have been effective
and can lead to a relative error of < 2% [43] when validating the
parametrised model with real usage cycles. It is worth noting that,
under constant-current tests, there is a likely impact of ‘local (elec-
trode level) SoC’ inhomogeneities [45] on identified model param-
eter values that has not been quantified in the literature. Beyond
parametrisation,  the  authors  of  [42]  claim  that  identifying  and
tracking the evolution of model parameters using constant-current
capacity data unmasks the underlying mechanisms involved in bat-
tery degradation during cycling and storage.

Parametrisation  of  semi-empirical  models  by  fitting  constant-
current  load  data  is  over-simplistic  and  hinders  the  accuracy  of
a model when environmental and load conditions differ from the
training  data  set.  The  most  notable  semi-empirical  model  is  the
equivalent circuit model (ECM) which employs resistors, capacitors
and a voltage source to form a circuit network that analogously
describes cell behaviour [46] . Because the resistor and capacitor el-
ements within the ECM are influenced by measurement timescale
[47] , using constant-current capacity tests with typical timescales
of ∼ 3600 s has limited scope for grid applications or other appli-
cations with similar load profiles.

Data-driven  approaches  have  gained  attention  because  of  the
increasing  availability  of  large  quantities  of  battery  data.  Data-
driven  techniques  can  be  applied  in  various  ways,  and  each
amounts to different assumptions about the nature of the under-
lying processes. The simplest and most common data-driven ap-
proach is to use large look-up tables containing charge/discharge
capacity measured for different constant-current rates and temper-
atures [48–50] which can then be used to directly map voltage to
a battery SoC. The principal limitation of such empirical models is
the accuracy to which the SoC and by extension, range, can be es-
timated under dynamic loads as is the case in real-world scenarios.
The discrepancy between actual driving range and that estimated
by a battery management system (BMS) employing such empirical
models can be in the region of 25% [51–53] .

Within the class of data-driven models are models that use sta-
tistical techniques and machine-learning techniques for time-series
forecasting. These models have been used to estimate SoC and SoH
and include, for example, neural networks [54,55] , support vector
machines [56–58] , Kalman filters [59,60] and Gaussian processes
[61] . There are two principal limitations to these models. First, the
large amount of training data required to generate accurate predic-
tions is often more than six months’ worth [61] , and second, the
accuracy of the model is poor when environmental and load con-
ditions differ from the training dataset.

2.3. Application of constant-current capacity tests for characterising
degradation

The ageing of Li-ion cells involves complex electrochemical pro-
cesses which encompass various ageing mechanisms [5,32,62–69] .
The activation of an ageing mechanism depends on the usage con-
ditions. The effect in systems engineering is quantified by the SoH,
which is defined as a loss of cell capacity (capacity fade) and an
increase in cell resistance (power fade).

To  understand  the  causal  relationship  between  usage  profile
and capacity and power fade, a number of authors have carried
out  ageing  studies  where  usage  has  been  categorised  as  cycling

(cycle  life  test,  i.e.  long-term  ageing  tests  where  current  i  (cid:4) =  0)
[5,13,14,70–74]  or  storage  (calendar  life  tests,  i.e.  long-term  age-
ing  storage  tests  where  i = 0)  [75–77] .  To  characterise  the  im-
pact of these long-term ageing tests, a plethora of characterisation
tests have been performed. Specifically, constant-current capacity
tests  are  used  to  define  capacity  fade.  For  example, Wang  et  al.
[13,78] used C/20, C/2, 3C, and 6C constant-current capacity tests
to characterise the effect of their ageing tests, while Kassem et al.
[16] employed C/10, C/5, C/2, 1C, 2C, 3C, and 5C discharge rates.
Some researchers, such as Zhang et al. [13,70] , opted to measure
capacity at different temperatures.

There are nuances in employing different C-rates and temper-
atures  in  capacity  tests  to  capture  degradation.  For  degradation
studies, lower C-rates provide a more accurate valuation of ther-
modynamic  capacity  loss  through  loss  of  lithium  inventory  (LLI)
and loss of active material (LAM). Lower C-rates ≤ C/10 also facil-
itate electrochemical voltage spectroscopy analysis [79] which has
been employed to derive an understanding of degradation mech-
anisms  involved  in  the  ageing  process  [49,80,81] .  At  higher  C-
rates ≥ C/10, resistive effects play a more pronounced role and the
kinetics  can  be  investigated.  Capacity  tests  employing  higher  C-
rates will therefore include a convoluted mixture of both thermo-
dynamically and kinetically induced changes. However, low C-rate
tests have their own set of challenges; side reactions can influence
the results if a test duration is very long [82] , and high-precision
battery  cyclers  with  very  low  leakage  current  through  voltage-
sense cables are needed (details explained in Section 6 ). When low
C-rate  charge–discharge  capacity  is  performed  to  high  precision,
the result also can be used to forecast battery life [83,84] . How-
ever, prolonged characterisation profiles introduce another poten-
tial source of cell degradation. Every charge–discharge cycle con-
tributes to ageing as was shown by Zhang et al. [13] . In a worst-
case scenario, carrying out a set of characterisation tests (capac-
ity pulse power and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
tests) at −10 °C, 0 °C, 25 °C and 45 °C can reduce the cell capacity
by up to 2.8%.

2.4. Discussion

A diverse range of capacity tests exists in the literature employ-

ing a wide range of C-rates and temperatures.

A  pragmatic  approach  that  yields  useful  relevant  application
data is to characterise cell capacity considering C-rates that cor-
respond to the root mean square (RMS) current of typical usage
profiles and temperatures. A number of factors should be consid-
ered when analysing typical usage profiles. These include: (1) RMS
power/current demand, (2) harmonic content of the power/current
demands and (3) individual user conditions. In an automotive sce-
nario,  the  RMS  power/current  demand  is  directly  related  to  the
speed limit of the road, e.g. highway driving will have a higher av-
erage speed than city driving. The type of road will directly impact
the variation of power/current demand. For example, while high-
way driving has higher average demand, it is expected that cur-
rent/power fluctuations are low. In city driving, however, the aver-
age speed is low but there is a more pronounced fluctuating load
profile because of frequent stop-starts and accelerations.

A lack of data around usage profiles can be estimated via tools
such as AVL CRUISE or the 1-D model proposed by Taylor et al.
[85] which are relevant for automotive applications. The proposed
model was used to calculate the power/current demand on an in-
dividual cell within a battery and considered vehicle parameters
such  as  mass  and  drag  coefficient.  An  example  of  the  electrical
load on a cell generated from the well-established Artemis Motor-
way drive cycle [86] using the 1-D model presented in [85] which
considered a vehicle with a 28-kWh battery pack constructed from

model proposed by Taylor et al. [85] .

20Ah  LFP  commercial  pouch  cells  is  shown  in  Fig.  2 .  The  RMS
power for this example was 31.9 kW at pack level.

However, there are cases where the electrode potential does not
display Nernstian behaviour.

If  further  detailed  analysis  on  degradation  modes  is  sought,
then low C-rate ( ≤ C/10) capacity tests can be performed which
will generate thermodynamic data. In this case, when the appro-
priate high-precision equipment are employed and side reactions
are minimised, a lower rate yields better accuracy.

3. Open-circuit voltage tests

Open-circuit voltage (OCV) tests  refer to the  measurement of
the equilibrium voltage of a cell as a function of the SoC. At the
full-cell level, the OCV vs. SoC curve is defined by the OCV curves
of both active electrodes, the positive electrode (PE) and the neg-
ative electrode (NE). The specific individual electrode potential is
the potential difference between an electrode and a reference, in
most cases lithium metal when no external current flows and the
electrode potentials are at equilibrium. As such, the electrode po-
tential  incorporates  thermodynamic  information  about  the  elec-
trode such as the number and types of phase transitions under-
gone by the electrode materials during charge and discharge (most
battery electrodes undergo several phase transformations) and the
amount of lithium intercalated in any given phase [87] . Mathemat-
ically, the potential of an electrode material during a phase trans-
formation can be expressed via the chemical potential, which de-
termines  the  change  in  internal  energy  resulting  from  a  change
in the concentration of the ionic species. At equilibrium, and for
each  phase,  this  can  be  calculated  using  the  Nernst  equation  as

where E
0 is the standard redox potential, R is the gas constant, T
is the temperature, z is the number of electrons exchanged in the
redox reaction ( z = 1 for Li-ion systems), e is the elementary charge

energy of intercalated ions in specific sites within the lattice of the
host material [90] . The ratio of activities is dependent on the Gibbs
free energy of pure reaction of the products and the reactants [91] .

The  full  electrode  thermodynamic  potential/voltage  signature
depends on the number of phase transformations and solid solu-
tions that the active material experiences during lithium interca-
lation and de-intercalation. Fig. 3 presents an example of a hypo-
thetical material M undergoing lithiation to LiM. The phase dia-
gram of Fig. 3 (a) shows the different stable phases in the system
(Greek letters) as well as their domain of stability for both com-
position and temperature. At a given temperature as depicted by
the dotted line, the voltage variation associated with lithiation can
be predicted according to the nature of the reaction, solid solution
(one phase) or phase transformation (two phases). The associated
voltage variation is shown in Fig. 3 (c). The voltage of solid solu-
tions varies with the composition because the Gibbs free energy of
a pure reaction changes with the composition ( Fig. 3 (b), Region I,
III and V). Phase transformations present a voltage plateau because
0 f
there is a mixture of two phases which convolute, and thus (cid:4)G
remains constant ( Fig. 3 (b), Region II and IV).

The electrochemical response of an active material is influenced
principally by the transition metals that are undergoing oxidation

4  vs.  LiCoPO
and  reduction  (e.g.  LiFePO
2 ). It will also

be influenced by the starting atomic structure (e.g. α-V

5 ) and the nature of the counter ions (e.g. -PO
2 O
95] .

At the full-cell level, the OCV vs. SoC curve is defined by the
OCV curves of both active electrodes and two other significant pa-
rameters: the loading ratio that relates the capacity of the PE with
respect to the NE and an offset that takes into consideration even-
tual SoC shifts between the electrodes, i.e. that an electrode might
not be full when the other one is empty and vice versa, this is
shown in Fig. 4 (a) [96] .

Contrary to the assertion of some authors, the OCV vs. SoC re-
lationship of full cells changes with temperature and aging [97–
100] . This is clearly identified from Nernst Eq. (3) which shows a
temperature dependency; nevertheless, such changes are in most
cases  minimal  and  hence  negligible.  Changes  in  cell-level  OCV
with temperature can also be induced by changes in the bound-
aries  defining  regions  corresponding  to  solid  solution  and  phase
transformation as depicted by the dotted lines in Fig. 3 . In most

SoC is defined as “the ratio of the Ampere hours remaining in a cell
at a given rate to the rated capacity under the same specified con-
ditions ”. This is often misinterpreted in a second definition where
the ‘ rated capacity ’ is replaced by the ‘ nominal capacity ’. These def-
initions differ because the “rated capacity under the same specified
conditions ” refers to the maximum capacity at the rate that was
used under the same environmental conditions and not to nomi-
nal conditions. For electrochemists, SoC is a thermodynamic state
function  that  relates  to  the  ratio  of  the  remaining  intercalation
sites for Li ions divided by the total number of sites. These three
definitions are different and should not be confused. To take an
analogy of a fuel tank, the true USABC definition refers to the dis-
tance that can be covered if the speed is maintained. If the speed
is reduced or increased, the scale has changed, and subsequently
a new estimation is necessary. The misinterpreted definition us-
ing the nominal capacity instead of the rated capacity refers to the
distance that can be covered if the speed is set to a predetermined
value  (the  rate  at  which  the  nominal  capacity  was  determined).
The thermodynamic definition refers to the distance that can be
covered if the speed is reduced to the point where the fuel con-
sumption is the lowest possible. As a fuel gauge, the USABC def-
inition is more intuitive; nevertheless, in this case, the SoC scale
changes with current and thus provides no reference to thermody-
namics. The thermodynamic definition makes the least sense as a
fuel gauge but offers in-depth information and thus is easier to use
for modelling and degradation analysis. The misinterpreted defini-
tion serves no purpose and should never be used. The ambiguity
in defining a true accepted SoC measure arises from the fact that
both the USABC and thermodynamic definitions are relevant de-
pending on the application. One solution to this problem was pro-
posed by Dubarry et al. who used the USABC definition to calculate
the depth of discharge and the thermodynamic definition to calcu-
late the SoC [103] . In this case, depth of discharge was not equal to
1-SoC, however, a convenient fuel gauge was kept while avoiding
any ambiguity. More information on SoC can be found in a recent
review by Li et al. [104] .

cases, the OCV curve of the individual electrodes will not change
with aging because most materials are stable and will to interca-
late/deintercalate  lithium  in  the  same  way  close  to  equilibrium.
There  are,  however  exceptions,  with  the  best  known  being  the
voltage  fade  of  high-energy  Li-rich  layered  materials  [101] .  Even
with both electrodes having stable OCV curves with aging, the OCV
curve of a full cell is likely to evolve significantly upon aging be-
cause aging induces changes in the balance between the positive
and negative electrodes and thus modifies the loading ratio and
the offset as shown in Fig. 4 (a). Changes in the loading ratio and
offset not only affect the voltage response of a full cell but also its
capacity retention. Fig. 4 (b) presents an example of the impact of
loading ratio and offset variation on capacity loss (contour plot).
Further details are discussed in the electrochemical voltage spec-
troscopy (EVS) section.

It  is  essential  to  understand  the  origin  of  OCV  and  how  it
changes depending on the aging conditions. Of equal importance is
a proper definition of SoC, a parameter that is often ill-defined in
the literature. The definition of SoC is not straightforward and dif-
fers within the published literature. According to the USABC [102] ,

5 O

The thermodynamic definition of SoC, i.e. using the number of
available intercalation sites, is not adapted to modern Li-ion cells
and packs for several reasons. There are two working electrodes
and,  in  most  cases,  they  are  each  limiting  at  either  end  of  the
charge and discharge boundaries. That is, none of the electrodes
utilise their full range of available intercalation sites and therefore
their full SoC range. In the majority of cases, the NE is limiting at
the end of discharge and the PE at the end of charge; this relates to
the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer formation and the excess
graphite introduced to avoid plating, respectively. This is different
than Li
12 -based cells, where the NE is limiting on both sides,
and therefore the cell SoC is the same as that of the NE [105,106] .
Another issue arises with the use of layered oxides such as LiCoO
2 ,
NCA and LiCo
2 (NMC), where high voltage reactions
are not fully reversible. As a result, such materials are never fully
delithiated, and thus, even if the PE is limiting at the end of charge
the true SoC of the PE is not 100% at the end of charge. To take
all of this into account, an SoC definition based on exchangeable
Li ions was proposed in [49] . This definition only considered the
maximum number of Li ions that could be exchanged at a really
low rate for a given potential window. This definition is universal
and applies to half-cells, full cells and battery packs, even if imbal-
anced.

It is also important to note that, for every SoH, 100% of the SoC
is available at low rates. The SoC scale needs to be continually ad-

justed with aging so that a 100% SoC corresponds to the maximum
available capacity at any given time.

The  most  common  method  of  measuring  the  OCV  vs.  SoC
curves  is  based  on  the  galvanostatic  intermittent  titration  tech-
nique (GITT) or pseudo-OCV test. In what follows, the techniques
for measuring OCV and the associated hysteresis are discussed.

3.1. Galvanostatic intermittent titration technique

Popularised  in  the  late  1970 s  [107–110] ,  the  GITT  systemati-
cally adjusts a cell’s SoC with prolonged relaxation periods in be-
tween. The cell voltage changes with time mainly because of the
concentration  gradient  in  the  electrolyte  and  solid  phase  (diffu-
sion)  and  redistribution  in  the  solid  phase.  The  length  and  cur-
rent  of  the  discharge/charge step  and  the  duration  of  the  relax-
ation is dependent on the cell temperature and the required ac-
curacy. Since kinetic contributions are avoided in this technique,
these  OCV  measurements  are  believed  to  be  the  most  accurate.
An  alternative  method  to  GITT  is  the  potentiostatic  intermittent
titration  technique  which  employs  voltage  as  a  control  parame-
ter  instead  of  current  to  produce  similar  results.  However,  GITT
has been found to be much more popular than the potentiostatic
intermittent  titration  technique  in  previous  studies  reported  in
literature.

The  FreedomCAR  standard  [25,26,111]  (now  attributed to  US-
ABC) outlines the measurement of OCV with periods of relaxation
between  charge/discharge  pulses.  Although  this  is  not  strictly  a
GITT  test,  it  recommends  discharging  the  cell  in  10%  steps  and
subsequently  recording  the  voltage  after  1 h  of  rest.  This  granu-

larity of data and accuracy (considering the error that arises from
assuming that a cell reaches close to thermodynamic equilibrium
in 1 h) is considered sufficient for applications such as offline and
online  battery  management  system  (BMS)-level  modelling  [112] .
This is because the largest error in OCV measurements which em-
ploy the FreedomCAR approach (typically < 0.03%) is significantly
smaller than the smallest error of typical system-level models (typ-
ically > 2%) [113] . To achieve smooth OCV curves in this case, mod-
ellers often employ spline functions [114] or other smoothing tools
in their models.

More precise measurements of OCV can be informative to the
scientific community interested in accurately identifying different
electrochemical reactions and phases in both electrodes [115] . The
obvious change to the FreedomCAR method is the introduction of
more than 11 data points; i.e. to use SoC increments smaller than
10%. The second improvement is the introduction of longer relax-
ation periods. It has been suggested that a resting period of 1 h is
acceptable for LFP batteries [116] , but this is unlikely to be long
enough for other Li-ion cell chemistries to reach electrochemical
equilibrium  [117–119] ,  thereby  leading  to  discrepancies  between
the theoretical OCV and measured OCV. Li et al. [116] showed a
cell voltage change of only 2 mV after 1 h of relaxation for an LFP
cell.  However,  in  [119] ,  it  was  argued  that  a  cell  including  LFP
may not reach electrochemical equilibrium even 40 h after a dis-
charge/charge event. However, [118] suggests that 4 h is sufficient
for cells to reach a state close to equilibrium, such that any further
changes  in  voltage  typically  lower  than  1 mV  cannot  reliably  be
measured with common cell characterisation equipment. Although
long relaxation periods will provide voltage values very close to

theoretical, one has to weigh the improvement of the measured
values against the possibility of slow chemical reactions in the cell
which alter the true equilibrium state.

The authors of [118] argued that the optimal trade-off between
accuracy  and  test  duration  is  to  measure  OCV  for  every  1%  SoC
increment  with  a  rest  time  of  4 h,  which  equates  to  17  days  of
test time (101 rest periods, each of 4-h duration ∼17 days). This is
prohibitively long for investigators both within academia and in-
dustry and may not be economical or possible if time is of im-
portance.  As  alluded  to  above,  in  system-modelling  applications,
the FreedomCAR approach is sufficient. For example, Zhang et al.
[120] measured OCV according to the FreedomCAR standard. These
data were then used to develop an SoC estimation algorithm which
employed an extended Kalman filter to correct  for state estima-
tion errors. Using this extended Kalman filter algorithm, the SoC
estimation error was found to be within 5% during the entire pro-
cess of charging and discharging of a battery, which met the SoC
accuracy requirements set out in that study. Furthermore, the er-
ror in SoC estimation was negligible related to OCV measurements
and was linked more with errors in estimating a battery’s dynamic
state [120] . For tests aimed at characterising the change in OCV be-
cause of Li-ion cell degradation, Baccouche et al. found that using
an SoC increment of 2.5% provided sufficient detail to study OCV
evolution [121] .

The systematic approach to OCV testing is to first ‘weigh-up’ the
benefit of improved accuracy against the cost of longer rest periods
and shorter SoC increments. This will then inform the investigator
of the required accuracy and subsequently the SoC increments and
rest time needed for their application. It is also worth noting that
rather than using equidistant SoC increments, a better approach is
to define a bespoke distribution of SoC points based on expected
non-linearity as proposed by Nikolian et al. [122] . For regions of
high non-linearity in the OCV curve, it is more informative to in-
crease the number of data points in those regions than in regions
of relative linearity.

3.1.1. Application of GITT for characterising performance

The OCV of a cell, which is analogous to electromotive force,
can be used to define the performance capability of a Li-ion cell.
The  GITT  technique  has  therefore  been  used  in  exploratory  re-
search to investigate the performance characteristics of cells [123–
125] . Li et al. employed the GITT technique to calculate the lithium
diffusion coefficient for an entire SoC range of cells incorporated
with graphene sheets [126] . Their results indicated a two-fold in-
crease  in  the  diffusion  coefficient  when  graphene  sheets  were
used. Ding et al. [124] implemented GITT to measure the Li diffu-
sion coefficient of NMC-based cathode materials coated with AlF

In more recent literature, researchers such as Luo et al. [127] , Zhu
et al. [125] and the authors of [90,128,129] relied on the GITT tech-
nique to study the diffusion coefficient of different electrode ma-
terials. Ma et al. [130] employed GITT to compare the rate capabil-
ities of different cathode materials, i.e. Li
2 , and
NMC.

3.1.2. GITT technique for OCV hysteresis

In  some  cases,  the  GITT  curves  obtained  during  charge  and
discharge  are  slightly  different  and  present  a  potential  hystere-
sis,  even  if  significant  rest  is  allowed  for  each  step.  Srinivasan
and Newman [131] explained this phenomenon using a high-level
shrinking core model, while Dreyer et al. [132] explained it with
a  single-particle  model.  If  the  voltage  differences  are  restricted
to the plateaus in either charge or discharge regimes, the origin
of  hysteresis  is  likely  to  be  structural,  i.e.  a  phase  transforma-
tion occurs either through intercalation rather than deintercalata-

3 V [133,134] . The largest reported structural hysteresis was around
2 V  for  Li
2  [135] ,  although  this  material  is  not  consid-
ered for commercial Li-ion cells. It’s noteworthy that studies based
on  Silicon  anodes  suggest  a  correlation  between  the  mechanical
stress experienced by electrodes and voltage hysteresis [136,137] ,
although  any  causality  is  not  yet  established,  however,  indicates
the requirement of further research.

If,  however,  most  of  the  voltage  curve  is  affected,  a  part  of
the measured hysteresis may be an artefact related to the issues
surrounding  appropriate  SoC  referencing.  If  the  author’s  estima-
tion of SoCs are not properly aligned when the cells are charged
and discharged, a false hysteresis might be present as presented
in Fig. 4 of Ref. [138] . When 0% SoC is defined as the point when
a cell reaches its lowest discharge voltage V
min, dis while being dis-
charged, cells can have different relaxation voltages (different lithi-
ated states of electrodes) depending on the discharge profile, even
when discharged with the same current and at the same temper-
min, dis with 1C constant-
ature. For example, when discharged to V
current  without  interruption,  cells  will  have  a  higher  relaxation
voltage than when a cell is discharged to V
min, dis with 1C pulsed
current (as is done in GITT). This simple additional relaxation pe-
riod allows for solid-state diffusion and reduces the polarisation at
the electrodes, thus freeing Li sites at the surface for further in-
tercalation and leading to the removal of a higher amount of Li
from the anode before reaching the V
min, dis  as further explained
in [138] .

To eliminate this offset, Barai et al. [138] suggest performing a
charge OCV test immediately after the last 4-h rest period of the
discharge  OCV  test;  therefore,  the  last  OCV  measurement  of  the
discharge OCV test is defined as 0% SoC and becomes the first mea-
surement for the charge OCV test and removes the mismatch at 0%
SoC. To remove the mismatch at 100% SoC, it is suggested that the
actual capacity data are used instead of the estimated SoC. Further
details can be found in Ref [138] .

This technique can provide an accurate estimation of the real
OCV hysteresis for different chemistries. Employing this technique,
the OCV hysteresis of an LFP cell was found [136] to be much lower
than that previously shown [139–141] . To investigate OCV hystere-
sis, Roscher et al. [139] employed a GITT test with 5% SoC steps
and 3-h intermediate rest periods. They reported an approximate
20-mV hysteresis at 50% SoC when the test was performed with
C/2  charge–discharge  current  pulses.  Interestingly,  they  reported
that when the test was performed with a higher current pulse of
10C, the hysteresis effect was not present. This conclusion, how-
ever, was recently disputed when pulse rates between C/2 and 3C
were employed to show that hysteresis was not significantly af-
fected by charge–discharge pulse rates [142] . In [138] , the authors
reported the existence of a slight OCV hysteresis for different Li-ion
cell chemistries when the initial conditions were correctly identi-
fied.

Beyond thermodynamic entropic effects, materials such as LFP,

6 ) are subject to pronounced
voltage-hysteresis  arising  from  mechanical  effects.  Within  the
framework of phase-separation theory, which stipulates that dur-
ing Li insertion in a delithiated bulk material, a lithiated phase re-
gion emerges in juxtaposition to delithiated phase regions, differ-
ent lattice constants of lithiated and delithiated phases in phase
separation  materials  like  LiFePO
4  cause  mechanical  stress  at  the
phase barrier leading to a drop in the potential inside the indi-
vidual particles [143] . Moreover, lattice distortions, as a result of
doping  compounds,  hinder  the  propagation  of  the  phase  barrier
and thereby intensify the mechanical stress in the bulk material
[144] . Accordingly, voltage hysteresis between the charge and dis-
charge curves during galvanostatic testing is non-negligible even
at low current rates. At high rates of charge and discharge, volt-
age  hysteresis  is  expected  to  be  significant.  The  finding  of  a  di-

10

minishing  voltage-hysteresis  at  10C  is  therefore  unexpected.  Bai,
Cogswell and Bazant [145] proposed an alternative phase-field the-
ory. Within this framework, particle filling occurs homogeneously
above a critical current density. Above this critical current density,
the separation into Li-rich and Li-poor phases is suppressed, and
therefore, voltage-hysteresis arising from mechanical stress is re-
duced.

3.1.3. Application of GITT test for modelling

The  usage  of  GITT-based  OCV  profiles  varies  widely  depend-
ing on the modelling work, from extracting model parameters for
electrochemical  OCV  models  to  directly  using  the  data  in  semi-
empirical equivalent circuit models commonly employed for SoC
and SoH estimation.

Birkl et al. [90] developed an OCV estimation model to be inte-
grated as part of a larger cell model in a BMS. In developing their
model, they measured the OCV of both half-cells and full cells us-
ing the GITT technique. Their model was reported to have an accu-
racy of better than 5 mV. A significant portion of this small error
may be related to the relaxation period applied after each pulse in
the GITT. Petzl et al. [141] reported an 8-mV discrepancy in mea-
sured OCV arising from changing the post-pulse rest in GITT from
6 min to 5 h. The OCV was found to exponentially stabilise with
time. In their study, they also compared GITT test results with low-
rate (C/20 and C/40) charge/discharge tests. They reported a 20-mV
difference between the C/40 continuous OCV approximation com-
pared with a GITT with 5% SoC increments and 2-h rest period be-
tween each pulse. This difference was reduced when shorter rest
periods were used in the GITT. It follows that if the cells are still
relaxing after 2 h, the 20-mV difference could be higher if a longer
rest period was employed.

In  another  study,  Jonghoon  et  al.  [146]  performed  two  GITT
tests to measure OCV hysteresis, one with 10% SoC steps and an-
other  with  5%  SoC  steps.  The  data  were  then  used  to  develop
an online extended Kalman filter-based SoC estimation algorithm.
From a comparison between the two datasets, they found that the
performance of the algorithm was improved by up to 10 mV when
5% SoC-step test data were used. Similar conclusions were recently
made by Mao et al. [147] , who showed that shorter pulses com-
bined  with  longer  relaxation  periods  improved  estimation  accu-
racy.

Furthermore, OCV hysteresis as a function of capacity (and thus
SoC), in contrast to the use of a fixed OCV hysteresis value for all
SoCs as is often assumed in literature [148,149] , has been shown
to improve the performance of an ECM model [138] typically em-
ployed in a BMS.

To  support  the  modelling  of  a  layered  transition  metal-oxide
positive electrode, Dees et al. [150,151] employed GITT to estimate
Li transport within and between individual domains and the Li-
diffusion  parameter.  In  another  similar  study  using  a  Li y FeSO
4 F
electrode,  Delacourt  et  al.  [152]  employed  GITT  to  validate  their
mathematical  single-particle  model.  The  application  of  GITT  in
developing  models  for  the  electrochemical  kinetics  of  Li  ions
for different electrode materials has been presented in literature
[153,154] .

GITT results along with OCV hysteresis can significantly improve
model  performance  as  reported  by  researchers.  A  key  barrier  to
this method of OCV measurement is perhaps the duration of test-
ing, up to two weeks, which is probably tolerated because of the
improvement in model performance. Further research is required
to reduce the GITT test duration.

3.1.4. Application of GITT tests for characterising ageing

The  OCV  profile measured by GITT  can  also provide interest-
ing insights into cell degradation when employed along with other
characterisation tests and post-mortem analysis. In a recent study,

Fig. 5.  Change of OCV profile (GITT) with cycling as reported by [129] .

Shi et al. [129] showed that the change in cell performance char-
acteristics,  such  as  in  a  cell’s  polarisation  properties  and  appar-
ent diffusion coefficient, can be captured through a group of non-
destructive tests which included GITT. They considered a cell cy-
cled  at  a  high  temperature  which  led  to  changes  in  the  voltage
plateau  of  the  OCV  profile  captured  by  GITT  ( Fig.  5 ).  This  con-
firmed a phase change in the graphite anode. In a similar study
by Kleiner et al. [155] , GITT data were used to explain how the
degradation of Li-ion cells under storage ageing conditions is re-
lated to the change in the kinetics of the diffusion process within
the active materials. Application of GITT to quantify ageing mech-
anisms has also been seen in other research [156,157] . However, as
previously mentioned, the long test duration may act as a barrier
for its adoption in many other degradation related research studies
[14,16,78,158] where GITT could provide interesting insights for the
identification and quantification of degradation mechanisms.

3.2. Low-rate cycling and pseudo-OCV test

3.2.1. Test methodology

Depending  on  the  resolution  required,  deriving  an  OCV  from
a  GITT  experiment  can  take  several  weeks.  To  produce  thermo-
dynamic  information  faster,  a  cell  can  be  cycled  at  a  low  rate
to  generate  a  pseudo  OCV.  The  test  is  similar  to  a  capacity  test
with a constant low charge/discharge rate, typically C/25 or lower.
The low current is used to reduce kinetic contributions, lower the
electrode polarisation and reduce ohmic heat generation. When a
cell ) contribution to
low driving current is used, the ohmic loss ( IR
the cell voltage ( V
cell ) is low [141] . Furthermore, ohmic heat gen-
eration  is  assumed  to  be  negligible. An  example  of  low-rate  cy-
cling is shown in Fig. 6 , which illustrates the ability of low-rate
cycling  to  capture  phase  information.  The  simplicity  of  this  ap-
proach to capture thermodynamic information has attracted inter-
est  from  a  large  number  of  researchers  for  both  modelling  and
capturing  degradation  [13,16,49,75,78,81,98,100,141,159] .  Such  re-
searchers typically employ this technique at room temperature, al-
though  repetition  is  usually  carried  out  at  higher  and  sub-zero
temperatures  [98,100,159] .  There  is,  however,  no  standard  C-rate
employed in the literature for low-rate cycling, although C/25 is
evidently the most utilised.

Even with low rates, cell hysteresis is convoluted with the cell
overpotential, and the voltage response is different for each rate.
Although close, neither the low-rate charge nor discharge curves
can qualify as OCV or pseudo OCV. If it is to be used in place of
OCV for modelling purposes, the charge and discharge hysteresis
needs to be taken into consideration [138,160] . In low-rate regimes,
even where the impact of resistance can be neglected, hysteresis
is present in common electrode materials such as graphite [161] ,
Li
2 [90] ,
4 [133,162] , LiCoO
5 O
LiNiCoAlO
4  [138] .  Hysteresis  can  also  be  re-
lated to path dependency [131,132] of lithiation and should not be
confused with the structural potential hysteresis mentioned in the
previous section.

An alternative method to GITT to gather OCV data from low-
rate tests is to use an average of the charge and discharge curve.
The latter is known as a pseudo-OCV profile. An example of this
technique can be found in Truchot et al. [49] which employed a
C/25  current  to  measure  charge–discharge  voltage.  They  derived
the single-valued OCV from these two datasets by averaging and
subsequently  employed  this  OCV  for  their  SoC  estimation  algo-
rithm. This method of OCV measurement has been adopted in ear-
lier research by the same group of researchers for SoC estimation
from voltage relaxation [81,98,99,103,163,164] and for ECM mod-
elling  [165] .  To  validate  the  accuracy  of  their  approach,  the  au-
thors  often  compared  the  SoC  estimation  from  the  pseudo-OCV
curve to the real SoC obtained from measuring the residual capac-
ity [49,81] with good results.

vs. voltage curves [49] , where a variation of potential close to or
below the resolution of voltage sensors might correspond to a sig-
nificant change in the SoC. Xing et al. [159] used a C/20 current
to measure both charge and discharge voltage curves and averaged
these values to calculate the OCV. This OCV was later used for their
SoC estimation algorithm. In this procedure, they measured OCV at
intervals of 10 °C from 0 °C to 50 °C to capture the variation of OCV
at different tem peratures. The measured OCV showed a variation
of approximately 20 mV at a particular SoC.

The dependence of OCV on temperature can be explained using

the heat flow (  ̇ Q ) within a Li-ion cell, which can be defined as

3.2.2. Application of low-rate cycling test for characterising
performance

While the low-rate cycling test is simple to perform and pro-
vides first-hand insight into cell behaviour, it is not widely em-
ployed as a quick characterisation test in either literature or in-
dustry. The principal reasons identified for this include, first, the
long test period associated with this procedure, e.g. a C/25 cycle
will take more than 50 h to complete without including rest pe-
riods, which is often too long to employ as a quick characterisa-
tion  tool.  Second,  unlike  capacity  tests,  which  provide  a  specific
value  and  can  be  used  by  anyone,  this  test  generates  a  voltage
profile which requires detailed analysis. Nevertheless, Bloom et al.
[79,166,167]  and  Dubarry  et  al.  [81]  popularised  EVS  techniques
for analysing degradation mechanisms by investigating incremen-
tal  changes  in  voltage  owing  to  infinitesimal  changes  in  capac-
ity. Given the breadth of discussion needed for these techniques,
Section 4 is devoted to this.

3.2.3. Application of low-rate tests and pseudo OCV for modelling

The OCV profile is a key parameter of electrical equivalent cir-
cuit models, and in this regard, there are two approaches to allow
the use of low-rate cycles: the first takes hysteresis into account
[138,160] ,  while  the  second  uses  a  pseudo-OCV  profile  [49,165] .
Zhang et al. [75,168] used the C/33-rate charge/discharge voltage
curves along with a single-particle electrochemical model to study
the loss of cyclable Li for cells having undergone calendar ageing.
Although this simplistic form is popular, it may lead to high in-
accuracy in real applications, especially for cells with flatter OCV

The first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (4) represents irre-
versible resistive dissipation caused by the deviation of the surface
overpotential volume OCV owing to a resistance of the passage of
current ( I ). The second term is the reversible rate of heat gener-
ation owing to the electrochemical reactions. For electrochemical
reactions under fixed pressure conditions, the equilibrium poten-
tial is given by ∂ OCV / ∂ T ∼= (cid:4)S / F . The ratio of entropy change, (cid:2)S , to
the Faraday constant, F, is in the order of 4 × 10 −4 [114] . Uddin et
is comparable with the term V –
al. [114] showed that T

3.3. Discussion and future direction

There  is  no  standardised  method  for  performing  OCV  tests,
which limits direct comparison of literature results. Averaging low-
rate charge and discharge curves to generate a single OCV vs. SoC
curve seems to be the best compromise between time and accu-
racy, although one has to be careful about potential OCV hystere-
sis and kinetic limitations which might appear upon aging [169] .
Compared  with  alternative  methods  to  characterise  degradation,
because of the relatively long test time, low-rate cycling or pseudo-
OCV curves are not commonly employed for the characterisation
of degradation. However, with the rise in popularity of EVS tech-
niques (cf. Section 4 ), this might change for studies aiming at un-
derstanding the cell degradation mechanism.

GITT tests are commonly used to study individual electrodes;
however, its use in characterising commercial cells is less common.
It has been shown that GITT is a non-destructive approach that can
provide beneficial insights into the identification and quantification

of ageing mechanisms, yet most cell-ageing work reported in liter-
ature does not include a GITT test. Again, the key reason for this
may be the long test duration involved. Further reduction of the
test duration through the integration of an OCV relaxation model
with GITT tests may help reduce test times and thus promote a
larger penetration of this technique in the academic literature for
full-cell testing.

4. Electrochemical voltage spectroscopy tests

Tracking the changes in capacity and power retention provides
an instant snapshot of the state of the cell, but it does not enable
diagnosis because of the lack of accessible information on the ac-
tual degradation itself. Similarly, capacity and power tracking are
not  readily  suited  for  prognosis  either.  Such  knowledge  is  tradi-
tionally gathered via post-mortem analysis [9] , but some authors
have proved in recent years that it is also obtainable from data col-
lected during capacity tests. With ageing, the voltage response of
a cell changes, because as mentioned in Section 3 , the balance be-
tween the PE and NE changes [96,170] . Voltage changes can also be
associated with variations in the electrochemical reactions which
occur on either electrode [101] . Therefore, tracking and studying
these voltage changes will provide information on a cell’s thermo-
dynamic state and on its kinetics and thus enable diagnosis and
prognosis.

The voltage changes associated with a change in electrode bal-
ance and/or a change in the electrode signature are in most cases
minute, a few mV, and are therefore difficult to visualise and quan-
tify on the classic voltage (V) vs. capacity (Q) curve in which the
voltage range typically spans approximately 2 V. To enhance these
changes, a derivative of the V vs. Q curve is necessary. The incre-
mental capacity (IC), or dQ/dV = ƒ(V), was proposed by Belewski
and Brenet in 1967 [171] to study the reactivity of manganese diox-
ide versus a standard hydrogen electrode for Leclanché battery ap-
plications. The method was later used by Clauss and Schweigart
for the same application [172,173] , and Thompson applied it to Li
metal cells in the late 1970s [109,174,175] . Following these stud-
ies, the technique was adopted by other groups and started to be-
come  widely  used  with  Dahn  et  al.  [176–178]  and  Barker  et  al.
[179,180] as early adopters. In the 1990s, much attention was given
to potential electrodes for Li-ion cells with reports of the IC signa-
ture for graphite by several groups [181–183] and on positive elec-
trode materials notably by Valence Technology Inc. [184–190] and
others [191–193] . The first reports of the IC signature of full cells
date from the early 20 0 0s with work by Barker et al. [194,195] and
the Berkeley National Laboratory [196–200] . However, the analysis
of full-cell signature is complex and only little qualitative or quan-
titative information was decipherable at the time. To circumvent
this issue, Bloom et al. introduced another derivative method, dif-
ferential voltage analysis (DV) or dV/dQ = ƒ(Q) in 2005 [79,166,167] .
In the late 20 0 0s, Dubarry et al. proposed a methodology to in-
dex IC curves and thus opened the door for the full qualitative and
quantitative analysis of ageing on these [81,99,163,164] . Since then,
both techniques have been adopted and accepted as valid alterna-
tives to post-mortem techniques to characterise commercial cells
[5,201] . The following section introduces the principles and appli-
cability of these EVS.

4.1. EVS principles

Both IC and DV methodologies are based on the study of the
changes in the voltage signature of a cell. As mentioned in Section
3 , because of differences in chemical composition and/or crystal-
lographic structure, all active electrode materials have a different
thermodynamic  voltage  signature  with  a  different  set  of  voltage
plateaus and regions where the voltage varies with composition.

Fig. 7.  Relationship between (a) voltage curve and derivative curves (b) IC and (c)
DV.

Fig. 7 presents the voltage response of a hypothetical material, M,
undergoing a lithiation to LiM and the two derivatives of interest
with DV (c) and IC (b). It can be seen that for the IC curve, more
focus  is  given  to  the  phase  transformations  as  the  peaks  corre-
spond to the voltage plateaus. The DV curves focus on single-phase
regions with peaks for solid solutions.

Fig. 8 (b) presents the V vs. Q curve, Fig. 8 (a) the DV curves and
Fig. 8 (c) the IC curves associated with a full cell (red curves) and
its corresponding positive electrode (PE, blue curves) and negative
electrode (NE, black curves). The equations to calculate IC and DV
were taken from [79] and are provided in Fig. 8 (d). In this repre-
sentation, it can be seen from Fig. 8 (a) that for DV, the signature
of the full cell corresponds to the sum of the PE and NE signatures.
It can also be seen that the IC curve is much more complex in ap-
pearance where no immediate relationship between the full cell,
PE, and NE is visible. More details can be found in [202] .

In theory, both IC and DV should provide the same information
since they are derived from the same voltage curves. The selection
of which one to use is, therefore, a matter of preference. There are,
however, small differences between the two which could direct a
user towards one or the other:

− DV curves offer the advantage of being more visual for iden-
tifying  the  contribution  of  the  PE  and  NE  at  first  inspection
because of the additive nature of their relationship. However,
plotting of DV curves is not ideal for several reasons. The curve
has to be zoomed into to significantly see the centre peaks, and
therefore the information at the two limits is often lost. More-
over, the abscissa is capacity which changes with ageing; there-
fore, curves either need to be normalised or be aligned with
one end of the capacity scale. This could create confusion when
comparing studies using different plotting conventions. To alle-
viate this issue, Bloom et al. [79] suggested shifting the data
relative to  the data from the anode half-cell. The active area
should also be decreased to ensure consistency. Adopting such a
procedure aligns the voltage vs. capacity discharge curves; once
these adjustments are made, they should not change. IC curves,
however, require in-depth knowledge to derive valuable infor-
mation from first glance, but the abscissa is voltage and thus a
reference.

− When composite electrodes are used, i.e. electrodes with sev-
eral active materials, IC curves might be the better alternative
because the signature of both contributions is additive. This is
not the case for DV curves, and modelling (next section) will be
necessary to analyse the different contributions.

data were measured versus metallic Li. The capacity differences between the FC, NE and PE were induced by the usual excess of NE in Li-ion batteries as well as the capacity
loss associated with the solid electrolyte interphase formation.

− When  analysing  data  far  from  equilibrium,  i.e.  at  medium  to
high rates, IC curves may be a better alternative because the
changes  of  resistance  can  be  visualised  and  quantified.  This
is  not the  case for  the  DV curves.  Indeed, a  change of resis-
tance  will  induce  a  dV  but  no  dQ.  Therefore,  for  IC,  the  as-
sociated dQ/dV will effectively shift the cell response towards
lower/higher potentials during a discharge/charge regime. For
DV curves, the dV/dQ for that capacity will be 0; therefore, no
changes will be induced and some other characterisation tests
will be necessary to quantify the changes in ohmic resistance.

4.2. Application of EVS for qualitative degradation characterisation

Analysing the variations of IC and DV curves with ageing can be
a daunting task and might not be necessary for all studies. Some
relevant qualitative information can be gathered by simply plot-
ting the curves. From the literature, there are two examples where
it proves especially useful and where the IC or DV curves shall be
reported; they are summarised in Fig. 9 . The first example con-
cerns  studies  where  several  hypothetic  different  duty  cycles  are
compared (e.g. A, B, and C on Fig. 9 (a)). Duty cycles could differ
in term of temperature, intensity, depth of discharge or any other
parameter. In most cases, authors would conclude that A and B de-
graded the cell at  the same rate and that C  accelerated the ag-
ing by a factor of 2. This conclusion cannot be made from the ca-
pacity vs. cycle curve alone because that only shows that the rate
of capacity loss is similar or accelerated. The rate of capacity loss
and degradation are two different things and should not be con-
fused. Different degradation mechanisms can lead to the same ap-

parent capacity loss, and degradation can also occur without ca-
pacity  loss  [170,203] .  IC  curves  can  be  plotted  and  compared  to
reach a stronger conclusion ( Fig. 9 (b) and (c)). If these curves are
similar, then the degradation is the same; if not, the degradation
is different. The second example is often seen in the literature and
concerns modelling. In many studies, authors compare the exper-
imental and simulated data on a voltage vs. capacity curve while
claiming that they are overlapping quite well, and thus that the
electrochemical behaviour of the cell was replicated ( Fig. 9 (d)). As
discussed above, the V vs. Q curves lack the resolution needed to
make these claims, and the IC or DV curves must be plotted to pro-
vide a better comparison of the modelled and experimental curves.
If all peaks match, the electrochemical behaviour has indeed been
replicated. If not, the model cannot claim replication ( Fig. 9 (e)). A
good example of how an IC curve can help validate a model is pro-
vided in [204] .

4.3. Application of EVS for quantitative degradation characterisation

In the above section, EVS was used as a qualitative tool to com-
pare results. Some additional analysis is necessary to gather more
quantitative  information,  and  the  different  degradation  modes
need  to  be  assessed.  It  is  well  known  that  Li-ion  cell  degrada-
tion is complex and that many degradation mechanisms can occur
throughout the life of a cell depending on the operating conditions.
An abundance of literature describes these mechanisms [32,42,63–
65,67–69] . Quantifying all of these degradation mechanisms indi-
vidually  requires  a  plethora  of  tests  and  likely  some  significant
post-mortem analyses [9] . EVS methods cannot deliver such accu-

temperatures, SoC ranges...). Voltage curves were simulated using the ‘Alawa model [96] with graphite NEs and LFP PEs for (a–c) and LiMn 2 O 4 PEs for (d–e).

racy and details to compare with these tests, but they can be used
to gather information on degradation modes. As Dubarry et al. ex-
plained in [96,170] , all degradation mechanisms can be classified
into one or several of three categories or degradation modes de-
pending on how they affect cell electrochemical behaviour. Some
degradation mechanisms affect the amount of active material avail-
able for reaction (e.g. dissolution or grain isolation) and thus can
be classified as LAM. Some degradation mechanisms consume Li
ions  from  parasitic  reactions  (e.g.  SEI  layer  growth  and  inactive
species precipitation) and thus can be classified as LLI. Lastly, some
degradation mechanisms change the ohmic resistance of a cell (e.g.
corrosion of the current collectors) and alter the kinetics of the cell
(e.g. growth of passivation layers). These three degradation modes
change the balance between the PE and the NE (which may lead
to further LAM [205] ) and can be quantified using EVS. Bloom et
al. [79,166,167] explained how to interpret DV changes and relate
them to the different degradation modes. In the DV representation,
the signature of the PE and the NE are added to give the FC signa-
ture. In the case of LLI, the electrode signatures are not altered but
the overall range of usage decreases [206] . In the case of LAM, the
affected electrode signature is contracted compared to the other.
Changes of resistance are not visible in the DV representation be-
cause they do not involve any change of capacity [79,96,207] .

Dubarry et al. attempted the same classification for IC curves
[81,96,170] by considering a Li-ion cell as a communicating ves-
sel problem ( Fig. 10 (a)). They realised, with the clepsydra analogy,
that the shape of the vessel of a water tank corresponds to the IC

curves of the PE and NE and that the voltage of a cell corresponds
to the different liquid levels in both vessels. In this analogy, the liq-
uid corresponds to capacity. By changing the size or shape of each
vessel or the volume of liquid in each vessel independently, the
impact of all three degradation modes can be replicated [96,170] .
In the case of a LAM on the PE, the PE vessel becomes smaller
than  the  NE  vessel  ( Fig.  10 (b)),  but  the  voltage  of  all  the  peaks
on the PE IC curves remain the same. This is because the OCV of
the PE does not change, and therefore the voltage of all the peaks
does not change. Since the volume of the PE becomes smaller, the
same amount of liquid (capacity) inside is going to reach a higher
level and thus a higher voltage. This will change how the voltage
(the difference in liquid level of both vessels) is fluctuating with
time. The change of voltage with a LAM can therefore be predicted
from the vessel volume change and how it affects its contents. LLI
corresponds to a leak in the clepsydra, both NE and PE remain un-
changed but some liquid (capacity) is missing. Therefore, for the
same starting point, the level of liquid in the NE is lower than it
was initially as shown in Fig. 10 (c) and will change the voltage as
the lower vessel is filled with liquid. Changes in resistance do not
influence the balance of the electrodes but do affect their voltage,
and thus the vessels become closer in discharge and farther away
from each other in charge as shown in Fig. 10 (d). The final degra-
dation  mode,  an  increase of  the  faradaic resistance as  shown  in
Fig. 10 (e), can be represented as a stretch of the affected vessel be-
cause changes of kinetics are known to broaden the electrochemi-
cal peaks while maintaining the same area [208] .

Arrows exemplify the changes in the electrode IC signature, i.e. compression (horizontal arrow), shift (vertical arrow) or stretch (up-down arrow).

Experimental validation supporting both approaches (DV and IC
curves) for quantification of LLI and LAM degradation modes has
been reported by several groups [65,209,210] . In some more com-
plex cases [211] , the active material can gradually change to an-
other electrochemically active phase with a different OCV. This can
be  mitigated  by  considering  composite  electrodes  with  both  the
initial and final phases while gradually changing the composition
of the electrodes with cycling.

Based on these observations, the experimental variations of DV
and IC curves were analysed and associated with different degra-
dation modes.

4.4. Application of EVS for modelling performance

Although  it  is  possible  to  analyse  the  changes  in  DV  and  IC
curves  ‘by  hand’,  the  quantification  is  extremely  time  consum-
ing. To resolve this issue, several groups proposed to use experi-
mental half-cell data and fitting techniques to compose DV curves
[79,212–216] . In 2012, both Dahn et al. (DVAP) [207] and Dubarry
et  al.  (‘Alawa) [96,217] proposed freeware tool  boxes  to simplify
the analysis. The toolbox of Dahn et al. focused on DV and low-rate
curves. The toolbox of Dubarry et al. was more general and calcu-
lated DV and IC curves, among others, and could be used at dif-
ferent rates. Following these publications, many noteworthy stud-
ies successfully used these concepts [5,15,76,210,218–233] or built
new ones upon the proposed framework [5,65,90,234–237] .

It  is  important  to  the  point  out  that  many  studies  showed
that the change in IC and DV peaks were electrode specific and
that it is not recommended to extrapolate peak movements and
their association with a particular degradation mode from chem-
istry to chemistry. Examples of degradation tables (i.e. variations
of IC or DV curves for individual degradation modes) for graphite
intercalation compound (GIC)/LFP (IC and DV) [96] , GIC/NCA (IC)
[238] , GIC/NMC (IC) [219] and Li
12 /NMC (IC) [106] cells can
be found in the literature.

Pushing  towards  more  automated  analysis,  some  groups  pro-
posed methodologies to automatically analyse IC or DV curves for
either a large test matrix or BMS applications. Among the proposed
methodologies were full fits of the full-cell data [5,232,239–244] ,
partial fits [245,246] and peak tracking [227,232,240,247–252] . Al-

though all of these methods are promising, most authors only con-
sidered one degradation path to validate their results. Dubarry et
al. [251] showed that peak tracking methods might be far from ac-
curate for all possible degradation modes. They recommended us-
ing the information of several features of interest in an nD-space
to improve the universality of diagnosis.

4.5. Other EVS techniques

Over  the  years,  other  EVS  have  been  proposed  in  the  lit-
erature.  Smith  and  Dahn  studied  the  derivatives  of  IC  tech-
niques  [253]  and  Goh  at  al.  [232]  the  derivatives  of  DV  curves.
Some researchers used a distribution function [254,255] or force
[256] .  More  recently,  Merla  et  al.  proposed  differential  thermal
voltammetry  [257,258]  as  a  new  tool  to  study  Li-ion  cell  degra-
dation.  However,  these  techniques  are  still  in  the  very  early
stages  and  need  to  be  developed  further,  and  more  evidence  of
the  advantages  offered  are  required  before  they  can  be  widely
accepted.

4.6. Discussion and future direction

EVS techniques for the analysis of full-cell degradation are only
a decade old, but their accuracy and the amount of information
which can be deciphered have been demonstrated multiple times.
They now appear indispensable for diagnosis studies. They provide
nearly analogous information to post-mortem analysis to analyse
operando degradation rather than having several cells performing
the same function to be able to remove cells periodically for anal-
ysis. Moreover, EVS only requires the voltage response of a cell un-
der constant current, so it does not rely on additional equipment
or complex protocols and therefore is easy to implement in any
study and is potentially embeddable in BMSs.

The analysis of data is still very complex, and more and more
studies are trying to automate it. Ultimately, these techniques can
be incorporated in BMSs to monitor the SoH of large battery packs.
A word of caution from [251] is to ensure that whatever technique
is used to automate analysis, a proper sensitivity analysis must be
performed beforehand so that all the different degradation paths
are tested.

5. Internal impedance/resistance tests

The  power  capability  of  a  cell  is  intrinsically  related  to  its
impedance characteristics. In simplistic form, the impedance is the
voltage  drop  of  a  cell  under  a  given  current,  which  depends  on
the frequency and duration of the applied current. The impedance
will depend on the condition of a cell because a cell is an electro-
chemical system, namely, the SoC through the over-potential of the
paired electrode system [259] , temperature through electrochemi-
cal kinetics highlighted by the Butler–Volmer reaction rate equa-
tion [260] , current magnitude through diffusion limitation effects
[261,262] and ageing history through degradation of the internal
cell structure, SEI and parasitic reactions [32,263] .

The real part of complex impedance (i.e. the resistive part) is
directly responsible for the dissipative heat generation within a cell
[38] and thus the temperature rise of a cell while it is being used.
The resistive values of impedance have different contributions aris-
ing from pure ohmic resistance, charge transfer resistance and en-
tropy  change  [264–269] .  Therefore,  the  design  of  a  battery  pack
cooling/heating system is dependent on the cell impedance.

There are three techniques used for measuring cell impedance,
two  well  established  and  one  relatively  recent,  i.e.  pulse  power
test, EIS test and pulsed multisine signal test. These techniques are
discussed in detail in the following section.

5.1. Pulse power tests

5.1.1. Pulse power test procedure

The technique proposed by USABC [270] , known as hybrid pulse
power characterisation (HPPC) has been widely adopted in the lit-
erature  [22,24,26,46,111,271]  and  involves  measuring the  voltage
drop ( (cid:4)V ) resulting from a square-wave current load ( (cid:4)I ) applied
to a cell. The resistance ( R
pulse ) is then typically defined as the ra-
tio ( (cid:4)V / (cid:4)I ) and involves contributions from: (i) ohmic resistance,
R
0 , which comprises all electronic resistances of the cell [114] and
is  typically  responsible  for  the  steep  voltage  drop  instantaneous
of applying the current pulse, (ii) charge transfer resistance, R CT ,
which  is  attributed  to  the  charge  transfer  reaction  at  the  elec-
trode/electrolyte interface and typically occurs within the first few
seconds of applying the current pulse [272] and (iii) polarisation
resistance, R p , which accounts for ionic diffusion in the solid phase
and is usually considered to be the rate determining step for Li-ion
cells  [149,273] .  These  resistances  are  in  fact  electrical  analogues
which  enable  a  simpler  intuitive  understanding  of  the  complex
electrochemical processes involved. The authors want to reiterate
that  the R o ,  R CT  and  R p  terms  are  often  convoluted;  they  cannot
easily be completely separated in a simple form as shown in Fig.
11 . The ratio of R o , R CT and R p strongly depends on the cell design.
For example, R o is expected to be lower for high-power capability
cell  design  compared  to  high-energy  capability  cell  design,  even
when both designs share the same Li-ion battery chemistry.

In Fig. 11 , a general square-wave discharge current load with
the associated voltage response is shown. As depicted, the voltage
response (cid:4)V , which is the entire voltage drop caused by the cur-
rent load, does not differentiate between the processes that con-
pulse is a bulk parameter that includes
tributed to it, and therefore, R
multiple dynamics. Moreover, R
pulse is sensitive to the length of the
pulse (i.e. time). As reported by Schweiger et al. [274] , the resis-
1 C 10 second after 10 s is 11 m (cid:7), while for the same cell,
tance R
1 C 18 second is 14 m (cid:7). This is because
the resistance after 18 s R
for a pulse magnitude of 1C for 18 s, the cell may have reached its
diffusion limitation.

The aim of pulse tests is to estimate the resistance of a cell at
a given temperature, SoC and ageing state. For long-duration cur-
rent pulses, the cell enters a regime of solid-state diffusion where
the surface concentration of Li on active mass particles changes.

Fig. 11.  Schematic of voltage response to current square-wave current load. Por-
tions of the voltage curve resulting from ohmic resistance ( R 0 ), charge transfer re-
sistance ( R

CT ) and polarisation resistance ( R p ) are indicated.

This change in surface stoichiometry causes the open circuit po-
tential to change and therefore, in such regimes, it is not possible
to strictly attribute R
pulse to a single SoC. This was investigated in
detail by DuBeshter et al. [275,276] who showed that this effect
is much more pronounced for long pulse lengths, high C-rates and
low SoCs such as 10% SoC. In line with the results of this work,
similar issues are expected at mid-SoC points where a peak in the
IC curve exists. However, since the voltage gradient resulting from
solid-state diffusion is small, the standard technique of taking the
ratio (cid:4)V / (cid:4)I [26] is a good approximation, considering that short
pulse lengths are used and high C-rates and low SoC points are
avoided. For charge current pulse, voltage response will be inverted
compared to Fig. 11 ; however, the above discussion stands, with
the exception of a high SoC, e.g. 95% SoC, instead of a low SoC,
pulse measured from long pulse duration and/or high current
the R
cannot be assigned to a single SoC.

Waag et al. [272] attempted to decouple the ohmic and charge
transfer contributions to R
pulse by linearly interpolating the voltage
between 5 and 10 s of a 10 s pulse back to the start of the current
pulse. They then defined a direct current voltage drop ( (cid:4)V DCR ) as
the voltage difference between the starting voltage and the volt-
age interpolated to the start; the direct current resistance was then
defined  as  the  ratio  R DCR  ≡ (cid:4)V DCR / (cid:4)I .  While  the  predicted  re-
sistance between the two methods differed slightly, the choice of
interpolation  method  in  the  technique  of  Waag  et  al.  was  arbi-
trary  and  had  little  scientific  support.  Indeed,  10-s  [23]  and  18-
s [23] pulse lengths have little scientific motivation; nevertheless,
they are widely adopted in practice [5,26,277] .

In general, the resistance in the low SoC region is higher be-
cause of the lower number of available Li sites in the cathode as
the cell approaches either extremes of SoC as shown in Fig. 12 . Re-
sistance also increases at high SoC [278,279] , especially when mea-
sured with charge current pulse, however, not to the same extent
as at  a  low SoC  [279] . Although  cell  behaviour is  typically  non-
linear  in  extreme  SoC  regions,  pulse  power  tests  have  tradition-

ally considered 20%, 50%, and 80% SoC as promoted by the current
standards [22,23] . However, valuable information on cell dynamics
can be gained by taking pulse measurements at lower and higher
SoC points. This is limited at low SoCs and high SoCs by discharge
and charge pulses, respectively, which are unable to complete be-
cause of the maximum and minimum voltage restrictions on a cell.
In those extremes, other techniques such as the tracing of the con-
stant voltage phase during charge as explained by Eddahech et al.
[280] can be employed. For the automotive industry investigating
these extremes, it is useful for determining the capabilities of cells.
In  a  system  which  departs  from  ohmic  behaviour,  the  resis-
tance R
pulse can vary with current load. To account for such non-
linearity, testing procedures such as Refs. [22,23,26] suggest multi-
ple pulses spanning various loading currents at the same SoC. The
IEC 62,660–1 standard [22] pre-defines pulse magnitudes to be C/3,
1C, 2C, 5C, and maximum C for electric vehicle applications. How-
ever, such a method may exceed the operational safety limits of a
cell (at a particular SoC and temperature) and therefore provides
results that are outside of the usable scope of a cell [274] .

gested a first-order RC model (model with one parallel RC branch)
was best suited for an NMC cell and a first-order RC model with
one-state hysteresis for an LFP cell.

Pulse  power  tests  have  also  been  used  to  develop,  param-
eterise  and  validate  cell  thermal  models  [284–287] .  Ye  et  al.
[287] parametrised their thermal model via pulse power character-
isation test results at various temperatures (0 °C, 10 °C, 25 °C, and
55 °C). Employing the results of pulse power tests, they concluded
that reversible (entropic) heat generation is dominant during low-
rate discharge, while at high rates, irreversible Joule heating dom-
inates. In control applications, thermal management systems typ-
ically couple electrical performance models with thermal models
as  performed  by  Nieto  et  al.  [288] .  In  such  cases,  the  electrical
model defines the heat generation which then acts as an input to
the thermal model. It is noteworthy that an application boundary
exists beyond which pulse power tests are not suitable for model
development and parameterisation. In these cases, other internal
resistance measurement techniques and dynamic profiles to mea-
sure resistance may need to be employed.

5.1.2. Application of pulse power tests for modelling

Internal resistance is a key parameter for various cell models,
from simple empirical cell performance models to complex forms
of ECMs [17] . The PNGV cooperative research programme, through
the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, first
popularised  the  linear  lumped  parameter  equivalent  circuit  cell
model [281] for offline system modelling and analysis. Subsequent
publications from the programme presented methods for estimat-
ing the parameters of the model from HPPC test data [282] . Exten-
sions of this class of model for real-time and online applications
include the work of Sun et al. [283] who employed pulse power
tests  to  parameterise  an  ECM  used  to  estimate  in  real  time  the
peak power of a cell. The model achieved an accuracy of 2%. Use
of pulse power tests for the development of SoC estimation mod-
els is also well documented in the literature; examples include the
work of He et al. [277] and Tang et al. [140] . Both studies show
how internal resistance values measured from pulse power tests
can be utilised to generate SoC and state of energy estimation al-
gorithms.  Pulse  power  tests  are  also  commonly  used  to  validate
newly developed performance models [263] . Hu et al. [149] em-
ployed HPPC tests at 10 °C, 22 °C and 35 °C to perform a compar-
ative study of 12 different ECMs of Li-ion cells proposed by other
researchers. Considering model complexity and accuracy, they sug-

5.1.3. Application of pulse power tests for characterising degradation

Degradation  is  quantified  by  engineers  through  capacity  loss
and  resistance  rise.  This  is  inherently  limited  as  will  be  dis-
cussed  in  later  sections.  Still,  in  this  classical  quantification  ap-
proach, internal resistance is often estimated via pulse power tests
[13,14,289,290] . The rise in resistance owing to cycling [13,78] as
well as storage [14] was characterised through pulse power tests.
These  tests  combined  the  effect  of  various  degradation  mecha-
nisms and it was next to impossible to de-convolute. As argued
in [42] , understanding the precise nature of the resistance rise may
provide an avenue for avoiding degradation through effective man-
agement and control. In [291] , the authors showed that prognostics
models which were able to accurately estimate battery SoH can be
used by intelligent virtual power plants participating in vehicle-to-
grid operations to reduce electric vehicle battery degradation by
up to 9%.

When employed with other characterisation techniques, pulse
power tests can provide complementary data which are useful for
the  development  and  validation  of  ageing  models  [291,292] .  For
this, a matrix of tests at various temperatures and SoCs at periodic
times is useful.

5.2. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy test

5.2.1. Test procedures

EIS is a relatively specialised but widely applied technique em-
ployed  to  investigate  the  fundamental  electrochemical  dynamics
which occur at various timescales within a cell. A large number
of studies have documented static operational conditions and tem-
perature as variables that affect cell impedance.

Electrochemical impedance measurements are usually obtained
by applying a small sinusoidal potential to an electrochemical cell
and  measuring  the  current  response  through  the  cell  (potentio-
static measurement). Conversely, a sinusoidal current may be ap-
plied and the subsequent potential response measured (galvanos-
tatic measurement). In an ideal case, both yield the same result. In
a linear or pseudo-linear system, the current response to a sinu-
soidal potential is a sinusoid at the same frequency ( ω) but shifted
in  phase  ( φ)  and  with  a  different  amplitude.  In  a  pseudo-linear
system, the impedance of the cell is calculated as
V ( ω ) = V o ( ω ) e j φ 2 ( ω )

where φ = φ
1 . In EIS, Z ( ω) is measured over a range of fre-
quencies, commonly between 10 kHz and 10 MHz [118,270,291] , the
lower  limit  being  defined  by  the  limits  of  testing  time  and  the
upper  limit  governed  by  the  capture  of  inductive  behaviour  (i.e.
Im ( Z ( ω))  >  0).  In  addition,  lower  and  upper  limits  are  directly
linked to the  accuracy  of  the test  equipment. The  accuracy  of a
state-of-the-art EIS system can be in the μV and pA range; how-
ever, this accuracy reduces with increases in frequency, especially
beyond 1 kHz. For lower frequencies, a different source of error ex-
ists;  the  voltage  response  needs  to  be  purely  owing  to  the  cur-
rent signal. However, at low frequencies, the battery voltage may
change within a measurement cycle even though a small current
is used; this is dominated by the length of the cycle. For exam-
ple, at 1 MHz, the current signal will be applied for 10 0 0 s to mea-
sure a full cycle even with a small current because the duration
voltage may change; therefore, at a low frequency, the accuracy of
the EIS measurement will be reduced. The expression for | Z ( ω)| is
composed of real and imaginary parts which can be used to char-
acterise a cell and is typically depicted by a Nyquist plot (see Fig.

13 )  which  plots  the  real  part  of  | Z ( ω)| on  the  x-axis  against  the
negative imaginary part of | Z ( ω)| on the y-axis of the chart for all
frequency points.

The Nyquist plot as shown in Fig. 13 can be used to characterise
the  dynamic  behaviour  of  a  cell  [294,295] ,  develop  cell  models
[296,297] , parameterise cell models [298,299] and identify degra-
dation  mechanisms  [300,301] .  This  is  discussed  in  the  following
sections.

5.2.2. Impedance tests for characterising electrochemical dynamics

The impedance spectrum depicted in Fig. 13 has some points
which  are  typically  used  to  characterise  a  cell.  At  the  point
Im ( Z ( ω)) = 0, the cell changes from a capacitive to an inductive be-
haviour. At this transition point, both capacitive and inductive be-
haviours are balanced and an almost pure ohmic resistance ( R
0 )
is observed [272] . As a simple estimation, the difference between
Re ( Z ( ω )) at min { − Im ( Z ( ω ))} and R
0 is commonly assigned to the
charge transfer resistance R CT , which may not be a true represen-
tation.  The  frequency  at  which − Im ( Z ( ω))  has  a  local  maximum
corresponds  to  the  1/RC  characteristic  frequency;  the  lower  this
frequency,  the  slower  the  voltage  will  change  with  fast  current
changes  [272] .  According  to  previous  studies  [72] ,  cycling  a  cell
at  frequencies  lower  than  the  1/RC  characteristic  frequency  will
cause the cell to degrade through increased intercalation and de-
intercalation reactions, which indicates the importance of cell se-
lection for a particular application.
It has been argued that R

0 and R CT estimated by EIS may dif-
fer from that measured using pulse tests. According to current un-
derstandings [272,302] , this is because under large current loads
the cell, which is a complex electrochemical system, exhibits non-
linear properties (non-linear Butler–Volmer  kinetics). With  small
current  perturbations,  however,  the  system  behaves  in  a  linear
way, and the linear approximation employed to interpret EIS re-
sults hold well. It is worth highlighting that in the recent work of
Barai et al. [47] , the authors showed that, contrary to the current
loads suggested by researchers, the timescales (harmonic content)
associated with the applied current govern the apparent difference
in measured internal resistance.

In many high-power applications like motorsports and hybrid
powertrain battery packs, there are large power demands. In such
applications, fast transient response to power demands is crucial.
0 and R CT of the battery cells within the pack are re-

cases, EIS testing offers a fast and accurate method for deconvolut-
ing these parameters and can be pivotal.

should  be  justified  by  a  good  fit  without  direct  relation  to  the
physical processes.

5.2.2.1. Application  of  EIS  for  estimating  cell  temperature.  Recently
researchers have attempted to employ EIS to measure the inter-
nal temperature of cells. In 2014, Raijmaker et al. [303] proposed
that the frequency of the point where the Nyquist plot crosses the
x-axis is related to the temperature of a cell. They showed that the
frequency changed from 1600 Hz to 250 Hz when the temperature
changed from −20 °C to 50 °C. This trend persisted for 20%–100%
of SoC. A similar technique was studied earlier by Schmidt et al.
[304] and Srinivasan et al. [305] . Adopting a selection of frequency
points, Schmidt et al. investigated the internal temperature of a cell
and how measurement was affected by the SoC. As reported, the
internal  temperature  was  measured  with  an  accuracy  of ± 0.17 K
when the SoC was known and ± 2.5 K when the SoC was unknown.
Srinivasan et al. employed a similar technique but used phase shift
as an analogue of temperature change. They studied three types
of commercial cells of capacity 53 Ah, 2.3 Ah and 2.5 Ah and re-
ported a 0%–20 ° shift owing to a temperature change from 50 °C
to −20 °C of a 40-Hz sine-wave current signal; the phase shift was
affected by 1 ° with an SoC change from 5% to 95%. Therefore, a
very accurate estimation of internal temperature can be achieved
when an accurate SoC is known; however, a crude estimation is
also possible without knowing the SoC as reported by Schmidt et
al. [304] . A more recent study by Zhu et al. [306] and Beelen et al.
[307] provided more evidence of measuring internal temperature
using EIS. Zhu et al. developed a look-up-table-based methodology
where phase shift and impedance changes were both considered at
a particular frequency to translate the internal temperature.

However, until now, only the effect of SoC variation on the mea-
surement accuracy has been investigated. There are several other
sources which can contribute to the change of frequency point and
phase angle such as ageing, cell relaxation. An obvious change of
frequency, and thus phase angle, with ageing can be found in the
data reported in literature [14,129] . In addition, under load condi-
tions, a temperature gradient across a cell surface exists [28,35] ,
pointing to the fact that the temperature measured in this method
might be an average value when the actual temperature might be
higher or lower. Further research in this area is essential before
this application of EIS can be reliably implemented.

5.2.3. Application of EIS for modelling performance

The Nyquist plot of Fig. 13 depicts a typical new cell at a high
SoC. Commercial cells usually go through formation cycles at the
end  of  the  manufacturing  process  and  therefore  should  have  an
SEI layer formed. For new cells at a high SoC, the semicircles of
the SEI and double layer are likely combined as one semicircle. If
an EIS test is performed at a low SoC ( < 10% SoC), a second semi-
circle will be more pronounced [308] because the capacitance and
resistance related to the SEI are not expected to change as much as
the double-layer capacitance and charge transfer resistance with a
change in the SoC. In addition, as a cell ages, the SEI layer will
grow and become progressively more pronounced at higher SoCs
with ageing [158] . Therefore, in a Nyquist plot, the second semi-
circle  at  higher  frequencies  will  progressively  become  more  dis-
tinct at higher SoCs. In that case, decoupling the contributions of
R
0 , R SEI  and R CT  become more convoluted. As proposed by Andre
et al. [263] , ideally, a second-order ECM as shown in Fig. 14 was
fitted to the EIS data to extract the ECM parameters of a cell. The
SEI ) are attributed to the SEI, while
first parallel branches (CPE1, R
the second (CPE2, R
CT ) correspond to the charge transfer and the
Warburg impedance W represents the finite diffusion [309] . Com-
plex ECMs have been proposed previously to represent individual
physical processes within a cell [310,311] ; however, the simplified
ECM shown in Fig. 14 is commonly employed. To reiterate, no ECM

The capacitor in an equivalent circuit is often replaced with a
constant phase element (CPE) component (as in Fig. 14 ) as it bet-
ter  describes  the  inhomogeneity  of  an  electrode  surface  such  as
roughness  and  porosity  [312–314] .  The  electrodes  of  Li-ion  cells
are made up of fine microscopic particles of active materials. The
thickness of the active material varies and makes the electrode sur-
face rough. Therefore, the intercalation and de-intercalation of Li is
not uniform across an electrode surface. This leads to different re-
action resistance and capacitance contributions from different sec-
tions of the electrode. Overall, a cell’s capacitive behaviour devi-
ates from that of a pure capacitive one, which is represented by
the CPE. The impedance of a CPE is represented by
Z CPE = 1 / Q o ( jω ) n
where Q o is the admittance, ω = 2 π f and value of n varies from 0
to 1. When n = 0, the CPE represents a resistor; for n = 1 a capacitor
and for n = 0.5 a Warburg impedance [312,315] .

(8)

Higher-order models have been proposed to separate the con-
tribution of individual electrodes [293,296] . However, the reliable
separation of these contributions in a commercial cell is still an
open question. Nevertheless, a second-order model provides good
approximation of the electrochemical mechanisms within the cell
and is commonly employed in literature. As an example, Buller et
al. [297] developed ECMs based on EIS results for their simulation
work. They validated their ECM-based model using a pulse-current
profile which showed good agreement between measured data and
model estimation. Andre et al. [263] proposed an ideal ECM of a Li-
ion cell based on the Nyquist plots generated from EIS test results.
They proposed a methodology for ECM parameter estimation from
the Nyquist plot of a real battery cell. Based on the results, they
proposed models to estimate cell voltage depending on the cur-
rent, SoC and temperature of a cell. Their models were validated
using current profiles to provide evidence that accurate cell volt-
age prediction can be achieved for highly dynamic automotive ap-
plications even at low temperatures.

5.2.3.1. Application  of  EIS  for  SoC  estimation.  As  presented  in  Fig.
12 , cell impedance measured by pulse current varies with the SoC,
which is also the case for EIS. Therefore, researchers have inves-
tigated  the  use  of  on-board  EIS  to  estimate  the  SoC  of  battery
packs.  One  of  the  early  attempts  was  made  by  Rodrigues  et  al.
[312] . They reported that low frequency data from an EIS test is
suitable  for  prediction  of  the  SoC  of  a  cell.  In  a  similar  study,
Sauvant-Moynot et al. [316] attempted to employ EIS as a diagnos-
tic tool to measure the SoC of a cell. From the measurements on
a three-electrode cell, they found that low frequency results could
be  used  for  SoC  measurement.  However,  recent  studies  by  Barai
et al. [118,317] and Kindermann et al. [119] showed the potential
risk of on-board EIS measurement; EIS measurements are not re-
liable when a minimum relaxation period is applied following a
charge/discharge event. For a reliable measurement, ideally, cells
need to reach electrochemical equilibrium. Therefore, implementa-
tion of EIS for online SoC measurement may not be viable without
further research.

5.2.4. Application of EIS for characterising degradation

As  a  cell  ages,  its  impedance  changes.  Therefore,  researchers
employ EIS along with other characterisation techniques to quan-
tify ageing. Compared to other characterisation techniques such as
capacity and pulse power tests, EIS can provide some insight on
ageing. For example, Waag et al. [272] recently employed EIS to
investigate the impedance of Li-ion cells at various ageing states.
They reported SEI growth as one of the ageing mechanisms from

their EIS test results. In another ageing study, Shi et al. [129] em-
ployed  EIS  to  identify  ageing  mechanisms  owing  to  the  charge–
discharge  cycling  of  a  cell.  From  the  EIS  results,  they  concluded
that Li-ion diffusibility decreases with cycling, which increases the
diffusion  impedance.  Zheng  et  al.  [13]  investigated  the  effect  of
temperature and charge–discharge rate on cycling ageing using EIS.
They identified unstable SEI owing to high current which caused
consumption of active Li, impedance rise and capacity fade. Simi-
lar mechanisms have been identified by EIS in other ageing stud-
ies [13,14,16,75,318] . Vetter et al. [32] reviewed the ageing mecha-
nisms of Li-ion cells and identified EIS as a powerful tool to study
cell ageing.

As impedance changes with ageing, the SoH of a cell can be
measured by EIS as attempted by Galeotti et al. [308] . They de-
veloped an ECM based on a Nyquist plot to generate a model to
estimate the SoH of a cell. Their model estimated the SoH of a cell
within 3.73% error and within 8.66% for an anomalous cell. How-
ever, this was not the first attempt to measure SoH using EIS; pre-
viously, Love et al. [300] , Kassem et al. [16] and Sauvant-Moynot et
al. [316] proposed EIS-based SoH estimation of a battery cell and
pack. Love et al. [300,319] showed that single-point EIS measure-
ment is sufficient to identify the SoH of a cell. In their study us-
ing a 316-Hz signal, they successfully identified an overcharged cell
from a module made of four cells in a series connection.

5.3. Pulsed multisine signal tests

5.3.1. Pulsed multisine test procedure

While EIS offers the advantage of a range of frequencies, pulse
power square waves benefit from meaningful current amplitudes
with the limitation that, in the frequency domain, they only con-
tain predefined perturbations with odd-integer harmonic frequen-
cies, f , of the form 2 π (2 k − 1) f ) where k ∈ Z . The pulsed multi-
sine procedure aims to combine the advantages of multi-frequency
measurements with high pulse currents as applied in pulse tests.
Fig. 15 shows the basic design of a pulsed multisine profile which
involves a base signal and a multisine profile. The base signal is
equivalent to a pulse profile defined by maximum charge/discharge
currents and pulse lengths. Superpositioned with this base signal is
a multisine wave whose bandwidth and harmonic content are de-
termined by the application. The superimposition of these two sig-
nals produced a final pulsed multisine current profile. Although the
idea of multi-frequency measurements existed before the publica-
tion of [320,321] , its application to characterising Li-ion cell mod-

els was novel [320,321] . In real-world automotive duty cycles, most
of the harmonic content lies in the low ( < 10 Hz) to mid ( < 1 kHz)
frequency regime, although high frequency content is present dur-
ing charging and regenerative braking because of power electronics
switching [66] . Therefore, the pulsed multisine method can better
represent both the frequency bandwidth and the current load in
applications.

The method involves two key steps: capturing a cell’s voltage
response to a pulsed multisine current profile, and fitting the data
with an ECM to obtain the model parameters and thus the resis-
tance parameters. The method for parameter estimation is outlined
in [112] .

The frequency content of a multisine current profile varies de-
pending on the application requirement. One way to select the fre-
quency content is by analysing the frequency content of a repre-
sentative duty cycle. The discrete Fourier transform of the repre-
sentative duty cycle enables the identification of the frequencies
carrying most of the current. In a typical automotive duty cycle,
most of the current is delivered at frequencies below 10 Hz. Fur-
ther details of the design of pulsed multisine signals can be found
in [320] .

Like pulse and EIS tests, pulsed multisine tests are also typically
performed at different SoCs and temperatures. From the voltage re-
sponse, resistance (as a function of frequency) is estimated by em-
ploying an ECM. The resistance Z( ω) at a given angular frequency
ω is related to the complex current and voltage signal as
V ( ω ) = Z ( ω ) I ( ω ) + Measurement error.

(9)

The  error  can  arise  owing  to  the  measurement  error  of  the
equipment and/or nonlinear response of the cell. To estimate the
resistance  Z( ω) in  Eq.  (9)  from  a  known  I( ω) and  V( ω) requires
minimising  the  measurement  error  in  a  least-squares  sense.  A
method  known  as  the  local  polynomial  method  [321]  is  em-
ployed  to  estimate  the  resistance  Z( ω)  along  with  its  standard
deviation σ Z ( ω ). Once Z( ω ) is estimated, an ECM model is fitted to
obtain the internal resistance along with other dynamical param-
eters. A general m th -order ECM can be employed to calculate the
series resistance R
0  and remaining RC parameters. The resistance
of this general m th -order ECM is given as

Z m ( ω ) = R 0 +

The first term R

maining m-terms correspond to the resistance of the m RC pairs

with the product R
pair. However, a second-order model as shown in Fig. 14 is usually
a good trade-off between computational complexity and accuracy
of the parameter estimation.

The first- and second-order ECM parameters estimated from a
pulsed multisine test may not be as accurate as those of EIS; how-
ever,  when  an  EIS  test  setup  is  not  available,  the  multisine  test
provides  more  information  than  performing  only  a  pulse  power
test, requires no additional equipment and only takes minutes to
perform.  Even,  considering  the  complex  post-processing  of  data
involved for parameter extraction in a pulsed multisine test, the
multisine technique offers better separation of the R o , R
CT , and R p
components than that of a pulse test.

5.3.2. Application of pulsed multisine tests for characterisation,
modelling and degradation studies

The work of Widanalage et al. [320,321] in which the pulsed
multisine  technique  was  first  described  is  relatively  new,  and
thus  the  implementation  of  this  technique  for  characterisation
and  degradation  studies  is  still  under  development.  Allafi et  al.
[112] used pulse multisine data to validate an online scheme for
parameter estimation of a nonlinear Li-ion cell EDM. The authors
identified  a  major  drawback  of  the  pulsed  multisine  approach,
namely,  that  R
0  was  no  longer  well defined.  The  principal com-
ponent of the driving multisine current load is f = 1 Hz. Thus, the
analogy  of  the  ECM  components  with  physico-chemical  subpro-
cesses are undermined. Although the authors contend that this is-
sue  is  not  unique  to  the  multisine  technique,  it  is  persistent  in
pulse power experiments (typically f ≤ 0.1 Hz).

5.4. Discussion and future direction

It is often model parametrisation requirements that drive the
exhaustive  testing  of  impedance.  However,  as  is  seen  with  ex-
isting  testing  standards,  the  proposed  test  environments  often
avoid extremities—whether an extreme in temperature such as T
< −20 ◦C or an extreme in SoC such as SoC < 5% or SoC > 95%—
where the behaviour of Li-ion cells are most nonlinear. This can
be attributed to the assumption that such conditions do not reflect
a true representation of application, specifically because BMSs are
designed to avoid such extremes. With the growth of Li-ion bat-
tery adoption in grid applications, battery operations in extreme
temperatures and SoCs are more readily encountered. As such, for

improved model performance, more data points are required at ex-
tremities to capture the precise nature of the nonlinear behaviour.
The  most  widely  adopted  technique  for  estimating  cell  resis-
tance is pulse power testing; the key advantage of this technique
is its simplicity which promotes accessibility and the use of high
currents which mimic real-world scenarios. The pulsed multisine
approach is similar to pulse testing in the sense that it employs
high currents; in addition, the technique attempts to capture the
harmonic  content  of  real-world  usage.  The  motivation  being,  if
the data used for parametrisation are more representative of real-
world applications, model accuracy in real-world simulations will
be more accurate. However, this technique causes the analogy of
the  ECM  components  with  physico-chemical  subprocesses  to  be
0 is no longer well defined. In
undermined and as a consequence R
addition, the multiple RC pairs employed in the technique lead to
a problem of unique identifiability, which means that there will be
an ambiguity between the model parameters identified and their
actual physical values. The latter is a symptom which is persistent
in any model, phenomenological, fundamental or otherwise, which
employs optimisation for parameter estimation and has multiple
unknown parameters.

When using the pulsed multisine technique, it is worth noting
that unless researchers have access to expensive and bespoke test-
ing equipment (such as that employed in [66] ), the bandwidth will
be restricted by the capability of commercial battery cyclers (EIS
equipment cannot be used to generate high-current pulsed mul-
tisine signals). Current cycler capabilities are limited by their re-
spective signal rise and fall times, and therefore there are limits on
current switching (i.e. changes in input current signals). Typically,
the shortest step-size varies from 0.1 s to 0.01 s. For a cycler with
a 0.01 s step-size, the theoretical maximum frequency that can be
achieved is 50 Hz, although the actual frequency is much lower be-
cause more than two steps are required to reliably define a single
period.

Measurement  of  internal  resistance  employing  a  single  sine
wave, such as the 1 kHz impedance test, can be a viable technique
in high-volume manufacturing environments where a cell’s inter-
nal  impedance  is  required  to  be  closely  matched.  In  such  cases,
however, the frequency of the single sine wave should be selected
based specifically on the cell type, ideally considering the points of
interest on a Nyquist plot such as R

0 , R CT or any other point.

EIS can be employed to estimate different cell parameters ac-
curately. To do so, however, necessitates a sophisticated test setup

to ensure accuracy and reproducibility. It is known that the high-
frequency measurements dominated by inductive behaviour can be
affected by differences in the arrangement of the signal and sense
cables as part of the EIS test setup [309] . The reproducibility of
EIS results is also governed by the relaxation period, i.e. open cir-
cuit period after cells are charged/discharged [118,119] . In certain
cases,  EIS  measurements  can  be  localised  as  shown  by  Osswald
et al. [322] . In such cases, rather than measuring the impedance
of the entire cell, EIS measures a part of the cell. To avoid such
localised measurements, attention must be given to the welding
quality  used  to  connect  multiple  layers  (electrodes  inside  pouch
and prismatic cells) or tabs (inside cylindrical cells) and the num-
ber of layers/tabs. Nevertheless, when EIS tests are performed cor-
rectly, it is a powerful technique for characterising Li-ion cells.

Researchers  have  reported  the  dependency  of  internal  resis-
tance  measurements  on  the  technique  used  for  characterisation.
This dependency is governed by the measurement timescales as-
sociated with a technique, i.e. internal resistance values measured
by different techniques are different because of the measurement
timescales involved [47] . Fig. 16 depicts internal resistance values
measured with techniques with a range of associated measurement
timescales. The internal resistance values were found to be in close
agreement when measurement timescales matched [47] . However,
the results reported in [47] were limited by the number of SoCs
and  test  temperatures  and  therefore  need  to  be  validated  for  a
wider range of SoC and temperature.

6. Summary

Test  plans  are  a  function  of  equipment  and  time  availability,
data  requirements  and  associated  drawbacks.  Thus,  there  is  no
‘one-size-fits-all’ test plan. Practitioners should clearly define their
objectives and thus the required data, then identify which char-
acterisation test(s) can best achieve them; this review document
facilitates this process. The spectrum of non-destructive test meth-
ods which are employed for the characterisation of commercial Li-
ion cells is provided below and tabulated in Table 1 . This table is
a summary of the equipment and time requirements of each test.
It includes the types of applications for generated data and pro-
vides a cursory overview of the main benefits and drawbacks of
each test.

A  standard  capacity  test  is  one  of,  if  not  the  most,  common
method of characterisation. The key driving factor for its popular-
ity is simplicity and repeatability, equipment availability and the
speed  at  which  tests  can  be  performed.  However,  high  current
rates can create a capacity value which is the convoluted mixture
of both kinetic-induced and thermodynamic changes. When high-
current tests are unavoidable, active cooling of a cell surface with
strict temperature control (better than ± 1 °C) should be employed
rather than performing the test within a thermal chamber which
only maintains the desired room temperature and does not actively
maintain  the  temperature  of  the  cell.  Unfortunately,  there  is  no
standard to perform this operation. On the other side of the spec-
trum, when low currents are used, the signal-to-noise ratio of stan-
dard commercial battery cyclers (typical accuracy of 20 mA, 5 mV)
is often not sufficient, and therefore the capacity value recorded
can  be  significantly  different.  Therefore,  in  such  instances,  high-
precision battery cyclers, e.g. systems capable of accurately mea-
suring current of 1 mA, a voltage of 1 mV, and an input impedance
for voltage measurement higher than 100 M Ω should be employed
which will subsequently increase the cost of performing this test.
The OCV and subsequent charge–discharge hysteresis measured
in the GITT is particularly important to support the development
of  electrochemical  and  ECMs.  It  can  also  be  employed  to  inves-
tigate cell degradation. Although this test can be performed with
standard battery cycler equipment, the long duration (200 + hours)

limits wide adoption. This  leads to  the use  of  pseudo-OCV  tests
which are comparatively shorter (50 + hours) and provide a larger
number of data points throughout the SoC window. However, this
method relies on very small currents with high accuracy, and thus
the equipment costs rise considerably. In addition, even at very low
currents,  the  voltage/SoC  profiles  contain  a  much  larger  charge–
discharge  dependency  and  introduce  false  higher  levels  of  OCV
hysteresis than those of a pure GITT test. This can introduce errors
into the SoC calculations which the BMS or human analysis might
make.  One  major  advantage  of  the  pseudo-OCV  test  is  that  the
same data can be used for EVS analysis to produce IC/DV curves.
In contrast, because of the limited number of data points from a
GITT test, any IC/DV curve must be calculated separately and thus
would  increase  test  time  and  facility  utilisation.  As  explained  in
Section 4 , IC/DV curves are powerful non-destructive techniques to
identify degradation sources and mechanisms. They provide nearly
analogous information to post-mortem analysis and identify LAM
and LLI.

Pulse power tests can be used to determine the DC resistance
of cells. This is a relatively simple short-duration test that can be
performed with standard battery cycling equipment. Although pre-
viously pure Ohmic resistance was separated from dynamic parts,
typical commercial cell cyclers are usually limited to 10-Hz data
acquisition, whereas much faster ( > 100 Hz) data acquisition is re-
quired  to  capture  pure  Ohmic  resistance.  Therefore,  this  separa-
tion includes a high level of inaccuracy. Accurate separation can
be achieved from EIS test results. EIS allows the separation of ca-
pacitive and inductive behaviour and allows for the development
of an ECM and parameterisation of the model. This separation also
identifies the degradation sources and the contribution of degra-
dation  from  each  source.  This  makes  EIS  a  powerful  technique;
however, EIS requires specialised, high-accuracy equipment. In ad-
dition, it needs a sophisticated test setup to generate accurate test
data with high reliability and reproducibility. If not performed to
a high standard, EIS can produce misleading datasets. Every test
engineer/researcher  may  not  have  access  to  the  equipment  and
test  setup  required  for  an  EIS  test;  therefore,  the  pulsed  multi-
sine test is proposed. This technique can measure impedance with
low  frequency  and  high  current,  and  the  test  can  be  performed
with standard commercial battery cyclers offering the advantages
of both the EIS and pulse power technique. Compared to the pulse
power technique, pulsed multisine offers an additional dataset at
a cost of additional complexity of the test process and data pro-
cessing.  However,  when  compared  to  EIS,  the  accuracy  is  much
lower and, being limited to lower frequency only, pulsed multisine
cannot offer separation of all the dynamic parts of internal resis-
tance/impedance.

From the increasing demand and use of Li-ion cells, it is ex-
pected that application-specific characterisation tests will progres-
sively  become  more  important  for  future  development. We  con-
sider the test procedures reviewed in this review will be of value
to the reader to develop their ideal set of characterisation tests.

changes in the way energy storage systems are charac-
terised. Dr Barai as PI and Co-I previously led research
projects funded by the ‘Research Development Fund’ at
the University of Warwick and the UK Department of Transport. In the past, he
delivered multiple commercial research packages and authored high impact jour-
nal articles in the area of lithium-ion battery characterisation. Dr Barai currently
lead energy storage characterisation related research within the energy innovation
centre (EIC) at WMG, University of Warwick .

Kotub Uddin is Head of Research at OVO Energy. He leads
the identification and integration of exploratory academic
research into the development of commercial products.
He also leads OVO Energy’s electrochemical energy stor-
age strategy and guides the development of smart control
strategies for energy storage devices. Kotub joined OVO
Energy in February 2018, previously leading research on
energy storage technologies at WMG, University of War-
wick. He has nearly 10 years’ experience in collaborative
research specialising in the application of electrochemi-
cal energy storage technologies for low carbon transport
and power-grid decarbonisation which ranges from math-
ematical modelling and fundamental science to systems
engineering and experimental validation. He has published over 20 peer-reviewed
articles and led a wide portfolio of collaborative research projects funded by EPSRC,
Innovate UK and Industry. These projects have been underpinned by significant in-
dustrial and academic collaboration with leading UK and International organisations
(e.g. JLR, ATKearney, Honda, AVL, Peel Group, eCar Club, Arrival, Cenex). Before the
University of Warwick , Kotub held a Visiting Research Fellow position at the De-
partment of Mechanical Engineering, Imperial College (2013–2016). In industry, he
was a Senior Research Engineer at Jaguar Land Rover (2009–2012) and Principal
Technical Consultant in alternative fuels at Ricardo Energy and Environment (2015–
2016).

Matthieu Dubarry (PhD, Electrochemistry & Solid State
Science, University of Nantes), has over 15 years of expe-
rience in renewable energy, with an emphasis in the area
of lithium ion batteries. Following his PhD on the synthe-
sis and characterization of materials for lithium batteries,
Dr. Dubarry joined the Hawaii Natural Energy Institute at
the University of Hawaii at M  ̄anoa as a post-doctoral fel-
low in 2005 to work on the analysis of the usage of a
fleet of electric vehicles. He was later appointed a faculty
position in 2010 with a focus on battery testing, modeling
and simulation. While working for HNEI, Dr. Dubarry pi-
oneered the use of new techniques for the analysis of the
degradation of Li-ion cells and developed numerous soft-
ware tools facilitating the prognosis of Li-ion battery degradation both at the sin-
gle cell and the battery pack level. Current projects include the evaluation of grid
scale Li-ion battery energy storage systems; the evaluation of the impact of vehicle-
to-grid strategies on electric vehicle battery pack degradation; and the testing of
emerging battery technologies for grid-connected and transportation applications.

Dr Limhi Somerville is currently the Advanced Cell De-
sign Manager at Jaguar Land Rover, having also worked as
a lithium-ion cell specialist. He previously worked at Ar-
gonne National Laboratory looking into methods of mate-
rials and electrical characterisation of lithium-ion cells for
lifetime determination. His doctorate, completed at The
University of Warwick was on the same topic and he also
holds a Masters of Science degree in Innovation from The
University of Warwick and a Bachelors of Science degree
in Chemistry from Bangor University.

Andrew McGordon Andrew joined WMG in May 2005
working on the Premium Automotive Research and De-
velopment Hybrid Vehicle projects and developed the hy-
brid powertrain simulation tool, WARPSTAR. Andrew is
currently a Principal Engineer in the Energy Storage and
Management group at WMG, working on energy storage,
vehicle modelling and battery ageing. He currently super-
vises research students working on vehicle energy man-
agement  strategies,  autonomous  vehicle  path  planning
techniques and battery performance in different duty cy-
cles.

Ira  Bloom  (PhD,  Inorganic  Chemistry,  University  of
Chicago) has over 30 years of experience in electrochem-
ical energy conversion devices, with an emphasis lately
on lithium-ion batteries. Following his doctoral work on
the synthesis and characterization of organometallic com-
pounds, Dr. Bloom join Argonne National Laboratory as a
post-doctoral fellow to work on homogeneous catalysis.
He later joined the Argonne faculty in 1984 with an em-
phasis on glass electrolytes for high-temperature, sodium-
ion batteries. While at Argonne, Dr. Bloom developed new
techniques and software for the characterization of bat-
tery degradation. These methods were transparent to bat-
tery technology and to battery scale (cell and pack). His
current interests are the investigation of battery degradation mechanisms, battery
testing, and post-test analysis of aged battery materials.
