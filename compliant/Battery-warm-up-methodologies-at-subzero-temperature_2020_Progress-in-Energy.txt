Preheating strategies

Electric vehicles play a crucial role in reducing fuel consumption and pollutant emissions for more sus-
tainable transportation. Lithium-ion batteries, as the most expensive but least understood component in
electric vehicles, directly affect vehicular driving range, safety, comfort, and reliability. However, the over-
all performance of traction batteries deteriorates significantly at low temperatures due to the reduced
electrochemical reaction rate and accelerated health degradation, such as lithium plating. Without timely
and effective actions, this performance degradation causes operational difficulties and safety hazards for
electric vehicles. Battery warm-up/preheating is of particular importance when operating electric vehi-
cles in cold geographical regions. To this end, this paper reviews various battery preheating strategies,
including external convective and conductive preheating, as well as the latest progress in internal heat-
ing solutions. The effects of low temperature on batteries from the perspectives of cell performance as
well as materials properties are briefly summarized. Thermal science issues involved in warm-up are also
elucidated. The framework of battery management systems (BTMS) at low temperatures, including the
key design considerations at different battery integration levels and the overall classification of warm-up
approaches into external and internal groups, are introduced in detail. Next, a comprehensive literature
review on different warm-up strategies is presented, and the basic principles, advantages, disadvantages,
and potential improvements of each strategy are elaborated. Finally, future trends of battery warm-up
methods are discussed in terms of key technologies, promising opportunities, and challenges.

1. Introduction

With the rapid economic and social development, there is an
ever-growing  need  for  energy  resources,  especially  in  the  trans-
portation  sector.  The  global  demand  for  energy  will  increase  by
nearly  one-third  by  2040,  and  oil  will  still  dominate  the  trans-
port demand [1] . Transportation electrification is a promising tech-
nology to counteract ever-rising energy demands and facilitate a
sustainable energy future [2–5] . In the past two decades, various
electric vehicles (EVs), such as battery electric vehicles (BEVs), hy-
brid electric vehicles (HEVs), and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles
(PHEVs),  have  been  developed  and  deployed  to  replace  the  tra-
ditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles [6–9] . Traction
batteries directly affect the performance, safety, and economy of
these electrified passenger vehicles. However, they have technolog-
ical and cost bottlenecks. Therefore, the development of traction
batteries, in terms of electrode/electrolyte materials, manufactur-
ing techniques, and system integration/controls, is critical to the
large-scale deployment of electrified passenger vehicles in the fu-
ture [10,11] .

Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries, with high power and energy den-
sity, high efficiency, long cycle life, low discharge rate, and environ-
mental friendliness [10,12] , are widely adopted as the energy stor-
age  component  in  current  electric  passenger  vehicles.  Neverthe-
less, the performance of Li-ion batteries is seriously undermined by
cold climates, especially at subzero temperatures. Li-ion batteries
with carbonaceous anodes, which are currently the dominant type
of vehicular traction batteries, are generally known for their poor
performance at such temperatures, caused by reduced conductivity
of electrolyte and solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) [13] , slow solid-
state  lithium  diffusion  [14,15] ,  high  polarization  of  graphite  an-
ode [16] and increased charge-transfer resistance at the electrolyte-

electrode  interface  [17–19] .  Internal  battery  resistance  increases
drastically at extreme conditions below −20 °C, which inevitably
leads to a considerable decrease in power sourcing/sinking capa-
bilities  [17] .  Furthermore,  there  is  a  high  risk  of  lithium  plating
at  the  surface  of  the  anode  when  the  battery  is  charged  at  ex-
tremely low temperatures, resulting in significant capacity loss and
even  internal  short  circuits  once  the  growing  lithium  dendrites
pierce the battery separator [20–22] . For electric passenger vehi-
cles, the risk exists when they require charging operations in ex-
treme weather and the battery temperature is below zero. Also, a
cold start-up is typically needed after parking EV for a long pe-
riod in cold weather. In such cases, the performance degradation
of Li-ion batteries at low temperatures leads to a significant reduc-
tion of the driving range of electric passenger vehicles and brings
potential safety hazards as well. In 2018, the global sales of EVs
were nearly 2 million and the majority of them are distributed in
China (1.1 million), Europe (385 thousand) and the United States
(361 thousand) [23] . The inconvenience brought by frigid weather
would  hinder  the  popularity  of  EVs  and  make  them  less  attrac-
tive in cold geographical regions such as northern China, Europe,
and the United States, where the recorded average winter temper-
atures are often below 0 °C [24] . Therefore, a big challenge for pop-
ularizing electric passenger vehicles is how to ensure normal and
safe battery operations at extreme temperatures, especially below
−20 °C.

To address this problem, many effort s at the battery material
level  have  been  made,  including  the  improvements  in  the  elec-
trolyte,  anode,  and  cathode  materials,  to  improve  Li-ion  battery
performance at low temperatures to some extent [25] . Neverthe-
less, these improvements cannot guarantee promising overall low-
temperature properties of Li-ion batteries in the short term. Other
solutions can be found at the operational level, where the main-

stream methodology in the literature is to preheat batteries from
extremely low temperatures to a pre-specified temperature before
normal operations, especially before fast charging [26,27] . This pro-
cess  can  be  realized  through  BTMS  in  various  ways,  and  batter-
ies can restore the performance as soon as their temperature rises
above zero. In recent years, considerable research efforts have been
dedicated to developing the strategies of warming up Li-ion batter-
ies in cold climate. Different warm-up approaches have their own
merits and weakness. Therefore, the choice of appropriate preheat-
ing method is crucial to the overall performance of electric passen-
ger vehicles at low temperatures.

Traditional  battery  preheating  strategies  typically  work  exter-
nally or internally, as surveyed in [28–30] . The two main strategies
are (1) taking advantage of a specially designed thermal manage-
ment system to transfer the heat generated by an external heat
source, through a heat transfer medium that can be either solid or
fluid, to the battery pack; and (2) applying a current to a battery
and, due to battery internal resistance, generating internal heat to
warm up the battery. Each strategy has limitations. For the first
strategy, the relatively long warm-up time, high energy consump-
tion, and low-temperature uniformity are the main concerns due
to heat loss and limited heat transfer efficiency [31] . For the sec-
ond strategy, current profiles that reduce the preheating time and
minimize battery degradation need to be further explored [32] .

Thermal  management  systems  with  higher  heating  efficiency
have recently been investigated to address these concerns. Inno-
vative ideas, such as incorporating more thermally conductive ma-
terials into BTMS, are likely to become promising solutions in this
research area. More recently, a diversity of improved current pa-
rameters  and  waveforms  are  synthesized  in  internal  preheating,
in  order  to  seek  a  delicate  trade-off between  heating  time  and
concomitant battery degradation [33] . An emerging battery struc-
ture, namely, self-heating lithium-ion battery (SHLB), has provided
a ground-breaking milestone for such a trade-off between preheat-
ing effect, energy consumption, and battery degradation [34] .

The overarching goal of this paper is to provide a timely, com-
prehensive  review  of  the  latest  progress  in  research  and  devel-
opment  of  battery  warm-up  techniques  at  low  temperatures  for
current commercial Li-ion traction batteries with graphite anodes.
This work goes beyond existing relevant survey articles on thermal
management [28,29] . Novel methods recently proposed, as well as
a systematic classification, are explained to better reflect the tech-
nological status and development directions of this ever-evolving
research field. Unlike other studies on this topic, this paper pro-
vides a summary of design considerations of BTMS at low temper-
atures  at  different  battery  integration  levels,  including  cell  level,
module/pack level, and system level. Furthermore, a comprehen-
sive review of various warm-up methods is presented. Various pos-
sible heating solutions for EVs in frigid weather, regardless of their
technique maturity, have been extensively investigated. For exter-
nal strategies, the heat transfer characteristics and heating perfor-
mances are discussed in detail. Improvements on ameliorating the
heat transfer rate and enhancing the heating efficiency in the ex-
ternal preheating systems, including the applications of nanoma-
terials such as nanofluids and nano-enhanced phase change mate-
rials (PCM), the adoptions of novel heating elements such as heat
pumps and film-based panel heaters, are, for the first time, sur-
veyed in the context. As for internal preheating, the latest SHLB
technology  and  its  performance  improvements  are  presented.  In
addition, recent advances in alternating current (AC) heating with
different current waveforms and parameters, as well as their heat-
ing  effects,  are  also  covered.  Both  external  and  internal  heating
strategies  are  discussed  in  terms  of  their  strengths,  weaknesses,
and maturity.

The  remainder  of  this  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  In
Section  2 ,  the  effects  of  low  temperature  on  batteries  from  the

perspective  of  materials  are  summarized,  and  the  thermal  sci-
ence issues involved in warm-up are first elucidated. The key de-
sign  considerations  of  BTMS  at  low  temperatures  and  the  over-
all  classification  for  existing  warm-up  strategies  are  elaborated
in Section 3 . Section 4 introduces the external heating strategies,
while Section 5 elucidates the internal heating strategies. The out-
look and future trends are presented in Section 6 , and the key con-
clusions are given in Section 7 .

2. Key scientific issues

2.1. Low-temperature performance of Li-ion battery

It is well known that the cold climate has a significant impact
on the performance of the Li-ion battery. Thus, it is important to
understand the extent to which this energy storage device suffers
from severe performance degradation.

A notable phenomenon of Li-ion battery at subzero tempera-
tures is the significantly reduced discharge capacity. At −10 °C, a
2.2 Ah 18650 cylindrical cell could only retain about 1.7 Ah dis-
charge  capacity  at  1C  discharge  rate  and  less  discharge  capacity
is obtained using a higher discharge rate (about 0.9 Ah in 4.6C)
[35] . The decreased discharge capacity would lead to a reduction of
the energy provided by the battery. A 100 Ah prismatic LiFeMnPO
4
HEV battery was tested to have an energy delivery of 226 Wh un-
der  1C  discharge  at  −10 °C  while  the  available  energy  could  be
293 Wh at 25 °C [36] . Besides, the cell resistance increases dramat-
ically at subzero temperatures. According to Zhang et al., the total
2 -based 18650 cell at −20 °C could be over
resistance of a LiCoO
than 1 (cid:2) while this value is almost less than 0.1 (cid:2) at 20 °C [17] .
This drastic resistance increase will limit the power delivered by
the battery. Experimental results also show that an 18650 Li-ion
battery could only have 1.25% power density at −40 °C compared
to the obtained values at 25 °C [37] . Meanwhile, charging the bat-
tery at low temperatures is likely to trigger lithium plating, which
often leads to severe battery capacity fade. At −10 °C, an 11.5 Ah Li-
ion cell was detected to have its capacity degradation rate increas-
ing sharply when then charge current exceeds 0.25C and capacity
loss can reach even 25% after 40 cycles at a charge rate of 0.5C
[21] . Higher charge rate would lead to severer capacity loss. Even
at 0 °C, a single charge cycle at 1C current would cause a 3.6% ir-
reversible capacity loss of a 7.5 Ah cell [38] . Therefore, the charge
rate of Li-ion battery is usually small at low temperatures in or-
der to prevent lithium plating, which extends the charge durations
dramatically.

2.2. Effects of cold climates on Li-ion batteries from a materials
perspective

The performance degradation of Li-ion batteries at low temper-
atures is due to the changes in battery materials properties, which
typically occurs on a micro-scale and makes the stored chemical
energy unusable in cold weather. Such microscale changes make
Li-ion batteries exhibit low charging acceptance, reduced discharge
capacity,  and  declined  power  capability  in  a  macroscale  at  low
temperatures.  Therefore,  the  intrinsic  properties  of  main  battery
components, including anode, electrolyte, and cathode, directly af-
fects the battery performance at temperature extremes.

The  main  mechanisms  examined  in  the  existing  reports  in-
clude  [39] :  1)  the  interfacial  phenomena  in  the  anode,  e.g.,  the
SEI  growth  at  a  graphite  anode;  2)  the  sluggish  kinetics  in  the
cathode, like the charge-transfer resistance increase, the inter-grain
resistance  increase,  and  the  slow  solid-state  Li  diffusion;  3)  the
increased electrolyte viscosity. Fig. 1 shows a variety of material
factors  contributing  to  the  declined  battery  performance  in  cold
weather, as summarized by Rodrigues et al. [39] . At the anode, the

material perspective.

passivation layers at the surface of graphite, known as SEI, become
less permissible to lithium ions at subzero temperatures, imped-
ing the motion of lithium ions from the electrolyte into graphite
particles. Specifically, the growing resistance contributed by charge
transfer and SEI leads to a significant increase in cell impedance
[18,40] .  In  addition,  the  solid-state  diffusion  of  lithium  ions  de-
scends drastically, which is more obvious in the lithiation process
(charging) than in the delithiation process (discharging) [15] . All
these phenomena in anode contribute to an increase in cell polar-
ization, making the graphite anode highly susceptible to lithium
plating  during  charging.  For  the  cathode,  the  charge-transfer  re-
sistance can be more than 300% higher than that at room tem-
perature, with much larger value at lithiated state (the discharged
state) [41] . High grain-boundary resistance and slow solid-state dif-
fusion are also regarded as intrinsic limitations. All these three fac-
tors contribute to sluggish lithium transport and poor electronic
conductivity in the cathode. In terms of the electrolyte, both in-
creased viscosity and reduced conductivity result in poor cell per-
formance. The former factor weakens the mobility of lithium ions
in the electrolyte solutions and the wettability of the electrolyte at
electrodes, while the latter one accelerates the lithium-ion deple-
tion near electrodes [40,42] .

Various techniques for improving battery materials can extend
the temperature frontiers of Li-ion batteries to some extent. For ex-
ample, the anode using lithium titanium oxide instead of graphite
or nanoparticle size; the electrolyte using organic solvents and co-
solvents  with  low  melting  point  and  low  viscosity;  the  cathode
using doping or reduced particle size for a shorter ion diffusional
path length [39] . However, commercial adoption of these enhanced
materials to improve the overall cell-level performance at low tem-
peratures constitutes a great challenge since trade-offs must be ex-
amined to balance the strengths and weaknesses of all those ma-
terials, which is difficult to achieve in a short or medium term.

2.3. Thermal science involved in battery warm-up processes

In  addition  to  improvements  of  battery  materials  themselves,
operating strategies can be used to eliminate adverse thermal ef-
fects due to cold weather, by controlling the battery temperature
within a favorable temperature range. In this way, improving the
battery  low-temperature  performance  becomes  a  thermal  issue,
and researchers need to understand the thermal behavior of the
battery and associated heat transfer characteristics in the cell level,
module level, and pack level. To warm up a battery from a subzero
temperature efficiently, the heat generation inside or outside the
battery cell, heat conduction, and heat convection, etc., must be
precisely modeled and controlled so that the temperature rise of
the battery can be regulated well. If an external heat source exists,
heat can be transferred to the battery either convectively or con-
ductively, with some heat losses to the ambient environment on
the heat transfer path.

Fig. 2.  Thermal issues involved in a battery warm-up process at low temperatures.

During battery warm-up, the cell geometry plays a significant
role in the heat transfer from the surrounding environment to the
cell interior, and thus affects the temperature distribution within
the cell as well as the module/pack. Specifically, in cylindrical cells,
the  heat  transfer  process  mainly  occurs  along  the  axial  and  ra-
dial direction. While in prismatic cells or pouch cells, the heat is
usually transferred along the in-plane and through-plane direction.
Besides, the thermal conductivity exhibits anisotropy in both cylin-
drical and prismatic cells in two directions [29] , resulting in non-
uniform temperature distribution within a single cell. In a battery
module/pack, since the heat transfer coefficient is not the same at
each position, the combination of the aforementioned factors con-
tributes to thermal gradients inside the battery pack. Additionally,
if heat generation also exists inside the battery, the battery thermal
behavior (also can be affected by cell geometry [43–45] ) and the
heat  exchange  with  surroundings  need  to  be  meticulously  mod-
eled in order to manage the battery temperature rise, especially
for large-scale integration of batteries.

Monitoring the battery temperature during the battery heating
process is also important. The temperature measurement locations
are  different  in  terms  of  cell  geometry.  For  cylindrical  cells,  the
temperature needs to be measured at different points on the cylin-
drical surface along the axis direction [46,47] . For prismatic cells
or pouch cells, temperature measurement is required at multiple
points on the two largest side surfaces [4 8,4 9] . The cell tempera-
ture is typically represented by averaging the measured tempera-
ture at different points.

Typically, operating such a preheating system requires some en-
ergy. The energy consumption needs to be considered during the
warm-up process. Therefore, heat transfer paths and patterns need
to be comprehensively designed to reduce undesirable heat losses,
for which some improvements can be made based on theories and
methodologies  from  thermal  science.  The  main  thermal  mecha-
nisms for battery preheating are shown in Fig. 2 , in which a cylin-
drical battery cell is used as an example.

3. A framework of battery thermal management system

3.1. Design consideration

The goal of battery thermal management at low temperatures
is  to  restore  the  energy  and  power  capability  of  Li-ion  batteries
as  well  as  eliminate  lithium  plating  through  heating  the  batter-
ies from a subzero temperature before the operation. However, the
preheating process under cold climate typically leads to extra en-
ergy consumption in EV, which makes heating batteries from low
temperatures  more  difficult  than  cooling  the  batteries  from  ele-
vated temperatures [50] . Therefore, energy optimization is needed

in the preheating systems in order to maximize the operating tem-
perature  range  of  batteries  without  reducing  cabin  comfort  and
depleting  the  stored  battery  energy  [31] .  Furthermore,  the  heat-
ing process cannot last too long for practical considerations, with-
out  exacerbating  battery  aging  simultaneously.  Considering  this,
the target temperature of preheating for the cold start-up is usu-
ally set to be above zero where batteries can restore most of their
capacity and power capability. For fast charging with charge rate
higher than 1C, the target temperature of warm-up needs to be
much  higher  than  0 °C  to  prevent  lithium  plating  under  such  a
high  current  rate.  In  addition,  temperature  uniformity  after  the
warm-up process plays a significant role in the performance of the
batteries in both the cell level and module/pack level. For a battery
cell, the uneven temperature distribution within the cell will cause
local deterioration which results in battery performance degrada-
tion and life span reduction [29] . For a battery system, unbalanced
charging  and  discharging  will  very  likely  cause  temperature  dif-
ferences between cells and modules, which will further result in
different cell aging rates and reduced overall capacity of the pack
[51,52] . Therefore, preheating strategies are expected to warm up
the batteries uniformly in a module/pack, with temperature differ-
ence among cells as well as modules less than 5 °C after the heat-
ing process. Other factors, such as the overall cost, system com-
plexity addition, safety, and reliability, should also be considered
when  designing  BTMS  at  low  temperatures.  The  aforementioned
design factors are listed below [28,29] :

(a) The electrical energy consumption;
(b) The preheating duration;
(c) The effect of heating on battery aging;
(d) The temperature uniformity of the battery cell, module, and

pack;

(e) The  overall  cost  including  the  cost  for  the  system,  opera-

tional cost, and maintenance cost;

(f) The complexity addition, such as the extra devices, weight,
and space needed due to the integration of the heating sys-
tem;

(g) The safety and reliability of the heating system.

in which (a)-(d) are treated as the performance metrics of various
preheating strategies in this review while (e)-(g) are only regarded
as extra consideration of the BTMS at low temperatures.

Normally, the performance of Li-ion batteries at low tempera-
tures is decided by the intrinsic material properties. However, ma-
terial improvements (including electrode modification, novel ma-
terials for electrodes and electrolyte) are long-term issues in the
development  of  Li-ion  batteries.  Thermal  management  operation
is demonstrated to be an effective measure to improve the low-
temperature performance of Li-ion batteries. Since the battery sys-
tem in EV consists of batteries at different levels, including the cell
level, module/pack level, and system level, considerations at each
level  are  usually  different  with  particular  focuses  when  design-
ing the battery preheating systems, as shown in Fig. 3 . At the cell
level, it is critical to model the cell behavior precisely at low tem-
peratures since acquiring the cell electrical potential, internal heat
generation,  and  aging  characteristics  accurately  are  essential  to
the development of effective thermal management strategies. Be-
sides, heat transfer between the cell and surrounding environment
should be considered with regard to the cell geometry when de-
signing the heat transfer path. Temperature distribution inside the
cell, which is affected by the anisotropic heat transfer and differ-
ent cell geometry, can become more uneven in large-format Li-ion
automotive batteries. Additionally, energy consumption and heat-
ing time should also be taken into account. For module/pack level,
accurate modeling of the battery module/pack is important to ob-
taining the heat generation, the energy and power capability of the
whole module/pack in cold climate. Unlike the heat transfer of a
single cell, the heat transfer in a battery module/pack is the com-
bination of cell-to-cell interaction and module/pack-to-surrounding
interaction, which could be affected by the cell geometry as well as
the cell configuration inside the module/pack. The uneven temper-
ature distribution inside the module/pack, which could trigger cell-
to-cell temperature and voltage inconsistency, varies with the heat
transfer and cell configuration of the module/pack. When batteries
are integrated into a large-scale energy storage component in EV,
the increased complexity of the low-temperature thermal manage-
ment system in EV needs to be considered. Besides, the heating
operations using battery power, including heating the powertrain

6

and cabin, are expected to have minimized cost. To this end, ex-
ploring effective ener gy management strategies at the system level
is critical in order to achieve cost-effective heating operations, and
these control strategies would vary with different powertrain hy-
bridization and electrification extent. In addition, system heating
strategies should not be at the expense of sacrificing cabin com-
fort of electric passenger vehicles in cold climate.

Despite that the low-temperature operations of battery systems
are emphasized in this paper, the cooling operations of batteries
from elevated temperatures are also critical to the performance of
EV. At high temperatures, Li-ion batteries are susceptible to accel-
erated components decomposition and a series of side reactions,
which inevitably exacerbate the battery degradation process and
increase the risk of thermal runaway [53,54] . As such, the design
and  addition  of  the  battery  preheating  system  should  not  affect
battery  cooling  performance  at  elevated  temperatures  to  ensure
that the same BTMS performs the cooling and heating role effi-
ciently in all climate.

3.2. Classification of battery warm-up strategies

Many battery preheating strategies have been proposed in the
past two decades, and the mainstream approaches are briefly re-
viewed in [29,31,56] . This section gives an overview of the exist-
ing preheating techniques and a widely used classification to reveal
the relationships between such strategies and their common char-
acteristics, which may help readers better understand the state of
the art of this research domain.

Several typical battery preheating techniques were first intro-
duced by Pesaran et al. [57,58] . In their work, two criteria for pre-
heating  batteries,  namely  the  source  of  the  energy/heat  and  the
energy/heat transfer patterns during heating, were identified and
could  be  treated  as  the  classification  standards  for  existing  ap-
proaches. The classification based on these two criteria is shown
in Fig. 4 . According to criterion (a), the heating strategies could be
divided  into  three  groups:  (1)  engine  heat-based  heating  by  us-
ing fluid (air or liquid) as the heat transfer medium; (2) battery
energy-based heating, in which the energy comes from the battery
itself;  (3)  generator/inverter  electricity  based  heating,  which  re-
quires additional hardware. According to criterion (b), those strate-
gies could be categorized into only two groups in terms of their
heat transfer pattern and whether the batteries are heated exter-
nally or internally. Various heating approaches exist in each group.
The two criteria mentioned earlier are applied to different pre-
heating  strategies.  Current  literature  tends  to  focus  on  the  heat
transfer characteristics of the preheating process and thus divide

Fig. 4.  Classification of preheating strategies based on two criteria: (a) the en-
ergy/heat source, and (b) the energy/heat transfer pattern during preheating.

generation.

the heating approaches into external heating and internal heating
[31,59] . However, the words “external” and “internal” were not de-
fined before Wang et al. [31] , who regarded the internal heating
strategies as an alternative where the heat is generated from the
source directly without passing the battery surface. Based on this
definition, “external heating” and “internal heating” can be defined
with respect to the location of heat generation, which is specified
by the battery boundary.

This  review  uses  the  mainstream  criterion,  namely  the  heat
transfer pattern during the preheating process, to identify recently
proposed  warm-up  techniques.  Fig.  5  shows  the  classification  of
preheating strategies and outlines the overall organization of this
review article. The existing strategies are primarily grouped into
external heating and internal heating. In external heating, although
heat is generated outside the battery boundary, it can warm up
the battery either convectively or conductively. Thus external heat-
ing  strategies  are  characterized  by  the  way  in  which  the  bat-
tery is directly heated. Convective heating includes air, liquid, and
heat  pump  heating,  whereas  conductive  heating  includes  resis-
tance, Peltier-effect, heat pipes, PCM, and burner heating. In some
strategies, such as heat pipes and vehicular power system heating,
although fluid is also involved in the warm-up process, the battery
is directly heated through heat conduction, and thus these strate-
gies are considered conductive heating.

Internal heating is generated inside the battery, and different
strategies are distinguished by the preheating circuit. Specifically,
internal self-heating uses the battery and a load to form the circuit.
Mutual pulse heating uses the battery and another energy reser-
voir to realize the charge/discharge process. SHLB does not need
an external circuit component; instead, they use an artificially in-
serted  metal  foil  to  form  the  electric  circuit  that  warms  up  the
battery. AC heating typically makes use of the battery and an AC
source to compose the circuit.

4. External heating

External heating strategies generally use a heat source outside
the battery cells (e.g., an electric heater or a thermoelectric device)
to  generate  the  majority  of  heat  used  for  battery  warm-up.  The
heat is then transferred to the battery cells convectively or conduc-
tively to heat them up to a pre-specified temperature value, where
the  battery  system  can  restore  most  of  their  energy  and  power
capability to meet the mileage and power demand of EV or the
batteries can be charged using high current rate without inducing
lithium plating at the graphite anode. The configurations of BTMS

7

for external heating often vary with respect to warm-up strategies,
in which the mass, geometry, and arrangement of the battery cells,
the  placement  and  the  properties  of  the  heat  sources,  the  heat
transfer characteristics from heat sources to battery cells could be
very different and, thus, the preheating performance would differ
from case to case.

4.1. Convective heating

Convective heating typically uses heat transfer media such as
air or liquid to absorb the heat released from the heat source and
takes advantage of the fluid flow to heat battery cells externally. In
this type of method, an electrical heater or a thermoelectric heater
is always needed, which can be powered either by batteries or ex-
ternal power source, to generate an adequate amount of heat for
warming up the heat transfer medium and the battery cells. To re-
duce the uneven temperature distribution among cells within the
battery pack, the heat transfer medium in the preheating system is
required to be circulated as a way of balancing heat provided for
each cell and increasing the convective heat transfer coefficient. As
such, extra components are needed in this system to reinforce the
circulation process. If air is used as the transfer medium, a fan is
always required, whereas, for liquid, a pump is needed.

4.1.1. Air heating

A typical convective heating strategy using air as the heat trans-
fer medium was proposed by Ji et al. [28] and can be further il-
lustrated in Fig. 6 . This heating system consists of battery cells, a
heater, a fan, an airflow channel, and other control components. At
low temperatures, the heater powered by the battery can produce
a large amount of heat to heat the air in this system, and the warm
air can subsequently heat the battery through convection. In this
battery-powered preheating case, an additional amount of heat can
be  generated  inside  the  battery  owing  to  its  internal  resistance.
This additional amount of heat can benefit the battery warm-up
process  by  accelerating  the  cell  temperature  increase.  Therefore,
precise modeling of heat generation inside the cell and the cell-
to-surrounding heat interaction is critical to the control of battery
temperature in this self-powered heating scenario. Besides, when
EV  has  access  to  external  power sources  (e.g.,  a  charging stand)

during preheating, the fan and heater can be powered by the ex-
ternal power source instead of batteries. In such a case, the heat
generation in this preheating system consumes grid energy rather
than the battery energy so that there is no heat generated inside
the  battery  cells,  and  the  heating  process  becomes  a  pure  heat
transfer problem.

In  [28] ,  the  authors  established  a  cell-level  model  for  the
battery-powered air heating method in an enclosed space, where
the boundary was assumed to be adiabatic. In their study, a single
18650 cell with 2.2 Ah was studied instead of the whole battery
pack, and the heat generation inside the cell was captured by an
electrochemical-thermal (ECT) coupled model. The airflow channel
was designed to be along the axial direction of the cylindrical cell,
and the airflow pattern was assumed to be circular-tube annulus
flow between the channel wall and lateral surface of the cell. Their
simulation results of this battery-powered strategy are presented
in Fig. 7 . There is a voltage decrease of the cell at the beginning
of the heating, but with the cell temperature rise, the voltage be-
gins to increase gradually. Using a heater with resistances of 0.8
(cid:2), the cell can be heated from −20 °C to 20 °C in 201 s. The heat-
ing time can be notably reduced to 85 s using a lower resistance
heater of 0.4 (cid:2) due to the fact that both larger voltage drop inside
the cell and increased current outside the cell contribute to higher
heat generation rate. However, considering the operational safety
of the battery, the resistance of the heater should be carefully de-
signed to limit the discharge rate, because the high discharge rate
and the increased battery resistance at low-temperature extremes
would cause the battery voltage to drop below its lower cut-off
voltage at the beginning of heating, which is most likely to trigger
cell over-discharge. Except for the resistance of the heater, airflow
characteristic also has an impact on the heating performance. Tur-
bulent airflow was pointed out to improve the heat transfer be-
tween  the  heater  and  air  significantly,  thus  making  the  heating
system more efficient.

Wang et al. [60] applied the air heating method to a battery
pack. An air heating box with an inlet and an outlet was designed,
in which 11 sets of resistance wires powered by an external power
source are wound in parallel to heat the air. The heating box is
directly connected in series to the original air cooling system so
that the air flowing to the battery pack can be heated in advance.
Then the warm air could be sent to the battery pack by fans to
heat the low-temperature batteries. The battery pack can be heated
from −15 °C to 0 °C in 21 min.

Song et al. [61] experimentally validated the effectiveness of air
heating using an external power source. A battery, which was fully
charged at room temperature, was placed in a cold environment of

8

X. Hu, Y. Zheng and D.A. Howey et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 77 (2020) 100806

−20 °C. They compared the battery remaining capacity after run-
ning 3 Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) cycles with
four scenarios where the preheating operations with different ex-
tents  were  performed  in  advance.  Their  experimental  results  in-
dicated that a battery can maintain greater discharge capacity if
the  surrounding  air  is  heated  to  room  temperature  level  before
start-up since battery internal resistance decreases when the cell
is heated. The greater rated capacity also suggests a greater driv-
ing range of EV in cold climate.

For actual vehicle applications, air heating can be achieved by
using control components and the heating ventilation and air con-
dition (HVAC) system in EV to form the heating circuit. Chen et al.
proposed  a  heating  strategy  by  using  external  power  [62] .  The
system  consists  of  traction  batteries,  battery  control  unit  (BCU),
charger module (CHM), a direct current-to-direct current (DC/DC)
converter,  a  positive  temperature  coefficient  (PTC)  heater  in  the
HVAC system, a host-positive relay, and a host-negative relay. At
low temperatures, when EV is connected to the charging pile, the
CHM outside the battery pack can supply power to the PTC heater.
A fuzzy controller was designed to restrict the maximum charging
power of CHM to avoid exacerbated battery aging. The batteries
can be then warmed up to a chargeable temperature by the HVAC
system through ventilating warm air to the pack.

In the battery preheating system, heating efficiency plays a cru-
cial  role  in  determining  the  heating  performance.  Higher  heat-
ing efficiency denotes potentially less energy consumption, shorter
preheating duration, and lower system operational cost during the
warm-up process. To evaluate the instant heating efficiency of the
preheating  system,  the  percentage  of  the  consumed  power  used
for the warm-up process is calculated. For battery-powered heating
systems, the heating efficiency can be obtained using the formula
below [28] :

η =

c pC m C d T C /dt
 ̇ q C + P out

(1)

where c pC  is the specific heat of the cell, m C  is the mass of the
cell, T C is the cell temperature, t is the time, the denominator rep-
resents the consumed battery power (  ̇ q C  is the internal heat gen-
eration rate of the cell, and P out is the output power of the cell).
When the heating elements in BTMS are powered by the external
power source such as a charging stand, the heating efficiency can

be calculated as follows:
c pC m C d T C /dt

The air heating system can be treated as a warm-up module in-
tegrated into vehicle powertrain to change the energy management
strategy (EMS) of EV in a cost-optimal way and comprehensively
improve vehicle performance at low temperatures. In EMS, system
operating cost typically consists of battery degradation cost, elec-
tricity cost (only in BEVs and PHEV) and fuel cost (only in HEV
and  PHEV),  which  are  calculated  as  equivalent  economic  cost  in
several driving cycles considering the cost of replacing the battery
pack, charging the battery using grid electricity and the fuel con-
sumption. Exacerbated battery degradation in cold weather would
inevitably  increase  the  EV  operating  cost  since  the  cost  of  bat-
tery replacement in EV is usually expensive and, thus, preheating
the battery before operation becomes beneficial to the cost reduc-
tion of EV. Song et al. [63] analyzed the possible benefits which
could be brought from battery heating operation in a hybrid en-
ergy storage system (HESS) of BEVs at low temperatures. The HESS
consists  of  batteries  and  supercapacitors  (SC).  The  configuration
of  HESS  with  the  air  heating  module  is  schematically  shown  in
Fig. 8 (a), with the average heating efficiency of 75%. An online EMS
for  the  HESS  was  proposed  and  the  minimum  system  operating
cost (the sum of electricity and battery degradation costs) could
be obtained by applying the dynamic programming (DP) approach.
They found that heating the battery pack before vehicle operation
can decrease the system operational cost by up to 12.49% when
the battery price is 400 $/KWh and a more remarkable cost reduc-
tion could be achieved if the battery price is higher. Meanwhile,
they  pointed  out  that  the  reduction  of  system  operational  costs
brought by battery-powered heating operations is trivial but this
benefit becomes more significant if the preheating process can be
powered by an external source such as a charger. This is due to
the fact that only a small heating power is required for maintain-
ing battery temperature once the battery has been warmed up. In
PHEVs,  to  calculate  the  operating  cost,  battery  degradation  cost,
electricity cost, and fuel cost need to be considered simultaneously.
Wang et al. [64] surveyed the potential economic benefits of pre-
heating battery pack in a PHEV by air heating strategy in the pow-

ertrain, with the system configuration illustrated in Fig. 8 (b). They
pointed out that when the ambient temperature was −20 °C, the
preheating strategy could limit the operating cost by up to 22.3% in
40 driving cycles, compared to the case without a preheating pro-
cess. Specifically, they also investigated the economy of preheating
strategies with the choices of power from an engine and the grid
with the conclusion that battery preheating powered by electricity
is much more economical than using fuel.

To summarize, preheating batteries using air as the heat trans-
fer  medium  presents  advantages  such  as  low  system  cost,  small
complexity  addition,  and  high  reliability,  making  this  heating
method easy to be implemented based on the original air manage-
ment system. The weight increase is also small since the weight of
the heater and the fan are trivial. However, the limited heat trans-
fer coefficient of air hampers the heat transfer of the air preheat-
ing system. This makes the heating difficult for large-format auto-
motive Li-ion batteries due to longer heat transfer distance from
the cell surface to its interior, causing notable thermal gradients
inside the cell. Moreover, this could also cause severe cell-to-cell
temperature variation in a module/pack. The heating efficiency re-
ported in [28] ranges between 0.6 and 0.8 throughout the heating
process. However, in real applications, this actual efficiency range
could be lower than 0.6–0.8 due to imperfect thermal isolation of
the system, unsatisfactory electrothermal conversion of the heater,
and lower-than-expected heat transfer coefficient, which results in
prolonged heating duration, increased energy consumption as well
as exacerbated temperature uniformity. Efforts can be made to en-
hance the heating efficiency by optimizing the geometric structure
of the airflow channel, changing the flowing pattern of warm air
(laminar flow or turbulent flow) as well as ameliorating the cell ar-
rangement in a battery module/pack. Furthermore, considering the
safety of the heating system, the current rate in battery-powered
heating operation should be limited to prevent over-discharge of
the battery at the beginning of warm-up. Also, the temperature of
the air and heater need to be controlled below a threshold value
to avoid potential fire risks.

4.1.2. Liquid heating

Compared with air, liquid exhibits a greater heat transfer co-
efficient so that better cell-to-cell temperature consistency could
be achieved. Therefore, liquid is also widely adopted as the heat
transfer medium in BTMS of EV. There are two ways that batteries
can be heated with liquid, i.e., by immersing the batteries in direct
contact with dielectric fluid or by placing jackets/plates containing
liquid channels inside the battery pack [57] . For the latter case, the
commonly used liquid includes water, oil, glycol, acetone, or mixed
solution (e.g., water-glycol).

Luo et al. designed a liquid heating system for a battery pack
consisting  of  16  prismatic  Li-ion  cells  with  a  capacity  of  37  Ah
[65] .  The  whole  battery  pack  was  immersed  in  a  closed  system
filled  with  dielectric  transformer  oil.  Fig.  9  illustrates  the  struc-
ture of the heating system. The electric heating film powered by
the external power source can heat the transformer oil when the
battery temperature is below 0 °C. The battery pack can be heated
from −30 °C and −10 °C to 0 °C in 35 min and 12 min, respectively.
Through circulating the oil in this liquid heating system, the cell-
to-cell  temperature  difference  can  be  controlled  within  3 °C.  For
safety  concerns,  the  maximum  temperature  of  the  electric  heat-
ing film should be far below the flashpoint of the dielectric oil to
avoid the risk of fire, and the flammability of the oil needs to be
considered when choosing this liquid heat transfer medium.

Compared  with  direct-contact  liquid  heating,  indirect-contact
heating  using  jacket/plate  can  significantly  reduce  the  space
needed for preheating systems in EV, though the walls of the heat-
ing jacket/plate might increase the thermal resistance. Yuan et al.
[66] designed a battery cooling/heating jacket and sandwiched ev-

ery line of batteries with the two cooling/heating jackets in the
pack.  The  heated  liquid  stream  was  contained  in  the  jacket  and
flowed in a U-shaped pipe embedded in the jacket. The effects of
pipe  diameter,  the  distance  of  two  adjacent  pipes,  the  inlet  liq-
uid velocity, and the inlet coolant temperature were numerically
investigated. These factors can be optimized to achieve more uni-
form and rapid heating. While the liquid flow rate and the temper-
ature can be controlled during the preheating process, the geome-
try of the internal channels would determine the inherent thermal
properties  of  the  heating  jacket/plate.  Therefore,  optimizing  the
configuration and geometry of liquid channels inside the heating
jacket/plate can augment the heat transfer of the jacket/plate and
realize  uniform  heating,  which  is  beneficial  to  both  heating  and
cooling processes. The improved design of the jacket/plate channel
in battery cooling cases, including parallel channel [67,68] , serpen-
tine channel [69] , and U-shape channel [70] , can also be applied to
battery warm-up in cold climates by substituting the cold coolant
into the heated fluid.

Similar to air heating, liquid heating can also be mounted into
EV to optimize the EMS at low temperatures. Zhu et al. [71] added
three PTC heaters, which can be powered by the charging pile, to
the original pipe-based liquid cooling system of a BEV. The heat-
ing  liquid,  a  mixture  of  glycol  and  water,  is  in  indirect  contact
with the battery pack and can be cycled in the loop by a pump.
They analyzed the liquid heating operation in the BEV by quan-
tifying the vehicle operating cost, which includes vehicle electric-
ity  consumption  cost  (consisting  of  preheating  energy  consump-
tion,  charging energy  lost,  vehicle running  energy  consumption),
and battery fade cost. Their results suggest that the optimal target
temperature of preheating increases when the ambient tempera-
ture becomes lower but decreases when the vehicle driving range
rises since the battery can warm itself during this long-range ve-
hicle operation. Meanwhile, the battery pack can be heated from
−10 °C to 2 °C in 1157s, within the temperature among cells within
3.1 °C.

Enhancing the thermal conductivity of the heat transfer fluid
also  has  great  significance  in  promoting  both  cooling  and  heat-
ing  performance.  At  low  temperatures,  a  highly  conductive  heat
transfer medium enables the heat to be transferred from the heat
sources to batteries more quickly and uniformly, which can effi-
ciently improve the heating efficiency of BTMS. However, the ther-
mal conductivity of traditional heat transfer fluid, such as mineral
oil, water, and water/glycol in liquid BTMS, exhibits some limita-
tions [54] . An effective way of improving the thermal conductivity
of the heat transfer fluid in BTMS is to add thermally conducting
nanoparticles into a base fluid, which could be water, ethylene gly-
col, or glycol-water mixture [72–75] . The application of such fluid,
also called nanofluid, can further improve the cooling and heating
3 nanofluid with a
performance of BTMS. For example, water-Al

volume fraction of 4% was utilized by Huo et al. for the cooling
of 5 cylindrical batteries connected in series [74] , in which the av-
erage cell temperature can be decreased by 7% compared to pure
water-based BTMS. Sefidan et al. [76] submerged each 18650 cell
in the battery pack into a thin cylindrical tank containing water-
3 nanofluid and observed improved temperature uniformity of
Al
the pack. Besides Al
3 , carbon nanotubes (CNT), with high ther-
mal conductivity, large specific surface area, and low specific grav-
ity, can also be added to the base fluid to enhance the thermal
conductivity of the nanofluid in BTMS [77] . Other nanofluids con-
taining metallic (Cu) nanoparticles, metallic oxide (CuO, TiO
2 ), and
nonmetallic oxide (SiO
2 ) can also be seen in the current literature
[78–82] .  The  application  of  these  nanofluids  in  BTMS  is  limited
so far, but the mature technologies in other areas such as engine
cooling using nanofluids may give some reference to the thermal
management of automotive batteries. Other properties of the liq-
uid, such as viscosity, density, and specific heat capacity, could also
affect the heat transfer rate between the wall of the battery mod-
ule and heat transfer fluid. Viscous fluid, such as mineral oil, tends
to have a lower flow rate during the circulation in a BTMS under a
certain pumping power [83] . Therefore, it is likely to have a thicker
boundary layer compared with less viscous fluid (e.g. water/glycol)
flowing with a higher flow rate, leading to a lower heat transfer
coefficient, especially in a narrow channel.

To  summarize,  liquid  has  better  thermal  conductivity  and  a
higher convective heat transfer rate. Both oil and water have nearly
three times larger heat transfer coefficients than air [83] . Thus the
nanofluid would be much more thermally conductive compared to
air. As such, the liquid-based preheating system is able to achieve
better temperature uniformity in the battery pack, with cell tem-
perature inconsistency around 3 °C even using conventional heat
transfer  fluid.  Therefore,  for  the  warm-up  of  large-format  Li-ion
batteries, heating with liquid is more suitable than heating with
air  due  to  the  superior  thermal  attributes  of  liquid.  Weaknesses
of liquid heating strategies also exist. Larger specific heat capac-
ity of liquid requires more energy to warm up the heat transfer
fluid at the beginning of heating, and this would probably drain
the battery energy in a battery-powered heating situation in cold
climates. Compared with air, liquid has much larger density, and
thus, adding too much liquid in BTMS would bring much weight
increase, especially in the direct-contact liquid heating case. In ad-
dition,  liquid  heating  systems  need  careful  (and  therefore  com-
plex) seal design and operation, e.g., to avoid leakage, in contrast
to air counterparts, which inevitably increases the number of con-
trol units as well as the system complexity. Despite this, the liq-
uid management system is still widely adopted in commercial EVs
with high safety and reliability due to its technical maturity.

4.1.3. Heat pump heating

A  heat  pump  is  a  device  that  can  achieve  efficient  heating
through the reversed Carnot cycle. It absorbs heat from the sur-
rounding environment and releases it to the area to be heated. The
coefficient of performance (COP) of the heat pump is defined as
the ratio of the amount of heat provided to the required work. The
COP is typically greater than 1, which means that heat pumps con-
sume less energy than electric heaters when providing the same
amount of heat. Therefore, the application of heat pumps in ther-
mal management systems of EVs may reduce the battery energy
consumption for cabin heating and battery warm-up in cold cli-
mate. Recently, Bosch used heat pumps in EV to capture the waste
heat  from  electric  motors  and  power  electronics,  and  use  it  to
warm up the vehicle cabin and keep the battery at around 35 °C,
which can extend the vehicle driving range by 25% [84] . Lee et al.
applied a heat pump in an electric bus to capture the waste heat
generated by electric devices and reuse it to heat the bus cabin
[85] .  Results  showed  that  the  COP  value  of  the  heat  pump  can

reach 2.4 when the ambient temperature was 10 °C. However, the
heat pump using a single heat source does not work efficiently un-
der the cold condition such as −10 °C ambient temperature, and
the  COP  value  is  close  to  1  (at  0 °C,  the  COP  value  could  range
between 2 and 3 for a heat pump with single heat source) [86] ,
which means heat pumps become less advantageous compared to
electric heaters. The heating performance can be improved by uti-
lizing the heat from multiple heat sources such as air and waste
heat in EV, and the COP value could be increased to higher than 2
at −10 °C [86] .

To summarize, heat pumps can typically achieve higher heat-
ing efficiency than electric heaters with high safety and reliabil-
ity when the same amount of battery energy is consumed. How-
ever, the low-temperature extreme poses challenges to the heating
performance of heat pumps, which requires the investigation and
improvement of heat pump heating technology at extremely low
temperatures  such  as  −20 °C  [87] .  Besides,  the  addition  of  con-
denser,  evaporator,  compressor,  refrigerant,  as  well  as  plenty  of
control  components  to  EV,  would  significantly  increase  the  cost,
weight,  and  complexity  of  this  heating  system.  Despite  the  rel-
atively mature technology of heat pumps in the integrated ther-
mal management of EV, their applications in warming up batteries
have seldom been investigated.

4.2. Conductive heating

In conductive heating, the heat-source elements are placed in
direct  contact  with  Li-ion  cells  or  modules.  Therefore,  the  heat
generated  by  the  heating  elements  can  be  conducted  to  battery
cells and warm them up directly, reducing the amount of heat loss
on the heat transfer path. Conductive heating mainly includes re-
sistance heating, Peltier-effect heating, heat pipes, burner heating,
and PCM heating.

4.2.1. Resistance heating

By placing the electric heaters or heating plates containing elec-
tric heating wires at the surface of battery cells, the heat produced
by the heater can be transferred to the cells in a straightforward
manner with significantly reduced heat transfer distance compared
to convective heating and, thus, the heat loss to the ambient envi-
ronment can be accordingly reduced. The most commonly applied
electric heaters in BTMS include PTC heater and metal resistance
(MR) heater, which could be powered by either the battery or ex-
ternal power source.

PTC  material  is a  temperature-sensitive semiconducting resis-
tive material. The resistance of PTC heater increases significantly
when its temperature exceeds the designed temperature threshold
so that the current flowing through the PTC heater can be regu-
lated  by  itself,  and  the  temperature  of  the  heater  can  be  main-
tained to a certain level [88,89] . Therefore, using PTC heaters with
an appropriate temperature threshold to heat battery cells can pre-
vent battery cells from overheating. Typically, PTC resistance wires
are inserted into or twined around the aluminum plates, and these
plates are placed between every adjacent cell pairs in a prismatic
battery  pack.  The  heat  generated  by  inserted  PTC  wires  can  be
distributed evenly on the aluminum plate due to the plate con-
duction and then warms up the adjacent battery cells uniformly
from  low  temperatures.  For  example,  a  battery  module  (consist-
ing  of  3  LiMn
4  prismatic  battery  cells  with  a  nominal  capac-
ity of 35 Ah for each cell and sandwiched by 4 aluminum heat-
ing  plates)  can  be  heated  from  −40 °C  to  0 °C  in  25 min,  when
PTC heaters were under an external power source delivering the
heating power of 35 W [90] . PTC heating can also be powered by
the  battery  itself,  and  in  this  battery-powered  heating  case,  the
heat generated inside the battery cells and the energy consump-
tion  of  warm-up  should  be  considered.  A  schematic  diagram  of

[102,103] ; (c) Composite film heaters which combine CNT with or-
ganic materials [104] , metallic nanowires [104] , or particles [105] .
These film-based panel heaters usually present better heating per-
formance  than  traditional  heaters  under  a  relatively  low  voltage
excitation. Therefore, the technology maturity of these film-based
panel heaters may give rise to their applications in battery ther-
mal management in cold weather so that the heating efficiency can
be improved without adding too much complexity (control compo-
nents needed and extra weight or space addition) to BTMS.

To sum up, the straightforward heat conduction of resistance
heating enables a shorter heat transfer route and reduced heat loss
to the ambient environment. Hence, high heating efficiency, short
heating time, and low energy consumption can be achieved. How-
ever, this preheating strategy also exhibits limitations. First, the ap-
plication  of  this  warm-up  technique  is  highly  dependent  on  the
geometry of battery cells. For prismatic batteries, the flat and large
side surfaces guarantee good contact between the electric heating
panel and the cell in a module/pack. However, for the cylindrical
battery, the cell geometry does not allow perfect contact between
the cell surface and the heater, which inevitably reduces the effec-
tive heating area and limits the heating efficiency. Therefore, resis-
tance heating is more preferable in a battery module/pack consist-
ing of prismatic cells. In addition, for large-format Li-ion batteries,
increased cell thickness renders larger temperature gradients in a
cell due to massive and quick heat accumulation at the surface of
the cells as well as prolonged heat conduction from the cell surface
to the core. Moreover, massive integration of cells in a battery pack
typically requires plenty of electric heaters, and the installation of
these heaters could take up some space and add much weight, es-
pecially when these heaters are relatively bulky. Since resistance
heating is a direct-contact heating method, for safety concerns, the
power of heating and the temperature of the heaters have to be
limited to prevent the local overheating within the battery mod-
ule/pack.

4.2.2. Peltier-effect heating

The  Peltier  effect  describes  a  heating/cooling  phenomenon  at
the interface between two different conductors when current flows
through  them.  The  direction  of  the  heat  flow  can  be  switched
by  changing  the  direction  of  the  current  [106] .  Peltier  effect-
based devices have been designed and applied to thermal manage-
ment of EV with high reliability and lightweight [107–110] . Alaoui
et al. [108,110] presented a thermal management system based on
Peltier-effect thermoelectric devices to warm up automotive batter-
ies at low temperatures. The basic thermal management unit in the
system is shown in Fig. 11 (a), consisting of 12 Peltier-effect units
sandwiched between two heat sinks. Three similar units were de-
signed for the thermal management of the front battery compart-
ment, the rear battery compartment, and the passenger compart-
ment, as shown in Fig. 11 (b). The temperature in the thermal man-
agement system could be regulated by a thermoelectric controller
by adjusting the current flowing through the unit. A hose system
can distribute the heated air to different compartments. The place-
ment of thermal units in the vehicle is shown in Fig. 11 (c). Exper-
imental  results  indicate  that  the  front  battery  compartment  and
the rear battery compartment can be heated from 17 °C to 37 °C
and 29 °C within 20 min, respectively. The temperature difference
between the front battery compartment and the rear battery com-
partment is due to heat dissipation from the hose system to the
ambient. Besides, this warm-up process consumed 2.5% initial ca-
pacity of the battery pack.

The  Peltier  effect-based  device  can  also  be  applied  in  direct
contact with the battery module in BTMS to realize heating, even
though in the current literature this thermal management system
has been primarily used to cool the battery [111,112] . The temper-
ature at the hot side of Peltier effect-based device can reach above

the  battery-powered  PTC  heating  at  the  pack  level  is  shown  in
Fig. 10 . The aluminum plates with embedded PTC resistance were
also placed between adjacent cell pairs. Jin et al. conducted exper-
iments on this battery-powered PTC heating in a prismatic battery
pack [91,92] . Results show that when the pack is at 100% initial
state of charge (SOC), the batteries can be heated from −19.3 °C
to −2.4 °C in 48 min, with temperature difference among cells less
than 3.506 °C. This battery-powered heating process consumes ap-
proximately 13% of the total pack energy. Besides, the pack with
lower initial SOC value was observed to have longer preheating du-
ration [92] .

Besides PTC, MR materials are also adopted as heat generation
elements in electric heaters. Wide-line metal film, which adopts
copper wire to generate heat, can also be applied in BTMS to heat
the  batteries  [93] .  Similar  to  PTC  heating,  by  placing  wide-line
metal films on the two largest surfaces of prismatic battery cells,
a  battery  pack  could  be  heated.  Experimental  results  show  that
under 90 W heating power, the battery pack can be heated from
−40 °C to restore 80% of the room-temperature discharge capacity
in 15 min [93] .

The placement of the electric heater in a battery pack also has
an impact on heating performance due to the geometric effect of
cells.  Zhang  et  al.  [94]  compared  the  case  of  placing  heaters  at
the side surface of prismatic battery cells with the case of placing
the heater at the bottom of a battery pack. With the same energy
consumption, the side-heating method enabled a battery system to
have a higher temperature rise and better temperature uniformity
compared to the bottom-heating method.

In resistance heating, the heating effect also relies on the prop-
erties of the electric heater. Factors such as heat capacity, electro-
thermal response, electro-thermal conversion capability, and tem-
perature distribution during heating, can affect the heating perfor-
mance of the electric heater. Film-based panel heaters, which are
developed based on CNT, exhibit low weight, low thermal capac-
ity, uniform heating, and quick electro-thermal response time [95] .
Therefore, with these attributes, film-based heaters have great po-
tentials in reducing energy consumption and heating time during
battery  warm-up.  Besides,  compared  with  those  relatively  bulky
conventional  electric  heaters,  the  small  thickness  of  these  film-
based heaters enables a reduction of installation space in a bat-
tery pack. Generally, film-based heaters with high heating perfor-
mance can be classified into several categories: (a) Pure CNT-based
heaters,  including  single-walled  [96,97] ,  double-walled  [98,99] ,
and  multi-walled  [100,101] ;  (b)  Metallic  nanowire-based  heaters

40 °C [111] so that the same system can also be used for battery
preheating at low temperatures by changing the direction of cur-
rent flow.

To summarize, Peltier-effect heating can achieve battery heating
safely and reliably with easy implementation of the Peltier-effect
device.  Nevertheless,  the  highest  COP  value  reported  in  [108]  is
1.036 when the ambient temperature is 17 °C, which suggests that
the heating performance of this Peltier-effect based thermal man-
agement  system  is  close  to  resistance  heating  (COP  is  approxi-
mate to 1). Therefore, the designed thermal management system
in [108] may not work as efficiently as resistance heating does in
cold climates, especially when the ambient temperature drops be-
low 0 °C. This could result in increased battery energy consump-
tion and prolonged preheating duration. Moreover, researches on
heating batteries in direct contact with Peltier-effect devices are
limited, and thus, further investigations are needed in the future.

4.2.3. Heat pipe heating

A  heat  pipe  is  an  efficient  thermal  element  for  heat  transfer
that can be used in battery thermal management for both high-
and low-temperature conditions. It takes advantage of evaporation
and condensation of the internal fluid when circulating inside the
heat pipe to transfer heat between two ends in a spontaneous way.
Wang et al. [113] designed a thermal management system based on
heat pipes to realize both cooling and heating functions, as shown
in Fig. 12 . L-shaped heat pipes were inserted into the cavity be-
tween adjacent pairs of battery cells, with one end each attached
to an aluminum plate. A liquid box with an inlet and an outlet was
placed underneath the battery module, in which the other end of
each l -shaped heat pipe was immersed in the fluid. At low tem-
peratures, the hot fluid flowing through the liquid box was capa-
ble of providing the heat to warm up the batteries. The heat from
the hot fluid could be transferred quickly along the heat pipes and
distributed uniformly on the aluminum plate so that the battery
was able to be heated. Results illustrated that, by using 20 °C hot
fluid, cells can be heated from −15 °C and −20 °C to 0 °C in 1200s
and 1500s, respectively. While, by using 40 °C hot fluid, the cells
can be heated from −15 °C and −20 °C to 0 °C in 300 s and 500 s,
respectively.

Micro heat pipe array (MHPA), a novel heat pipe structure with
high thermal conductivity, can also be applied to improve the heat-
ing performance, as shown in Fig. 13 (a). Each micro heat pipe in
the MHPA runs independently, and multiple pipes working simul-
taneously can greatly enhance heat conduction [114,115] . Ye et al.
[48] applied an MHPA for battery heating at low temperatures. In
the designed thermal management system, the evaporator section
of the MHPA was placed at the cell surface between every two ad-
jacent batteries, while the condenser section was exposed to air. A
heating plate was placed on the evaporator section of the MHPA
so that the heat could be transferred to the battery through the
MHPA, as shown in Fig. 13 (b). The configuration of the MHPA in a

ule. Under a heating power of 30 W, the battery could be heated
from  −10 °C,  −20 °C,  and  −30 °C  to  0 °C  in  approximately  350 s,
780 s, and 1100s, respectively.

At  the  system  level,  Zou  et  al.  [116]  presented  an  integrated
thermal management system for a five-chair EV, including a heat
pipe-based subsystem for battery temperature management and a
heat pump air conditioning system for cabin heating. The whole
thermal  management  system  can  be  used  for  both  heating  and
cooling  purposes  of  the  battery  as  well  as  cabin,  as  shown  in
Fig. 14 . In a preheating mode, the refrigerant valve RV1 and RV4
were closed while RV2 and RV3 were open. The expansion valves
EXV2 and EXV3 could adjust the refrigerant flow rate of the cabin
evaporator and battery chiller. The air heated by the heat pump
can warm the cabin while the coolant heated by a PTC heater can
provide heat for the battery pack through heat pipes. Experimen-
tal results showed that the COP for cabin heating could reach 1.34
when the ambient and in-car temperature was −20 °C and 20 °C,
respectively. The battery pack could be heated from −20 °C to 0 °C
in less than 900 s during the warm-up process.

To summarize, heat pipes, with excellent heat transfer perfor-
mance,  enable  the  heat  from  the  heat  source  to  be  transferred
quickly  to  batteries.  Therefore,  the  battery  warm-up  time  from
−20 °C to 0 °C can be usually controlled within 15 min in the afore-
mentioned researches. In addition, the lightweight, low cost, and
mature technology of the heat pipes allow them to have great po-
tential  in  battery  heating  with  high  safety  and  reliability.  How-

lidification process, a battery module can be heated, and its tem-
perature can be maintained for some time [121] . As a passive ther-
mal management strategy, using PCM to heat batteries can elimi-
nate the need for adding extra control components in BTMS since
the solidification process is merely related to the intrinsic proper-
ties of PCM. Moreover, the phase change process of PCM does not
consume battery energy so that the warm-up process can be com-
pleted without sacrificing the driving miles of EV.

The  temperature-retaining  capability  of  PCM  at  low  tempera-
tures  was  experimentally  investigated  by  Ling  et  al.  [122] .  They
found that the adopted PCM can keep the battery above 5 °C for
about 1 h when it is cooled from 40 °C in a cold environment of
−10 °C. They also pointed out that the thermal mass of PCM im-
pedes the battery temperature from rising rapidly in a single dis-
charge after a long-time soak in a cold environment. However, in
continuous  charge-discharge  cycles,  the  battery  with  PCM  has  a
higher average temperature than the case without PCM and thus
can have better performance.

Zhang  et  al.  [123]  devised  an  active  battery  heating  method
based on a phase-change slurry (PCS) cycle. PCS is a microencapsu-
lated PCM combined with a solution such as water or water-glycol,
in which the PCM was chosen to have a melting temperature of
10 °C.  In  a  PCS  cycle,  the  PCS  absorbs  heat  in  the  vehicle  cabin
with the PCM phase changing from solid to liquid when the cabin
is heated by the air conditioner and transports it to the battery
container by a pump. Then the PCS releases heat with the PCM
phase  changing  from  liquid  to  solid  and  warms  up  the  battery,
which enables the battery to work at 5–10 °C. However, this heat-
ing system  is not applicable in the extremely  cold environment,
such as −30 °C, because of the large heating load. Huo and Rao
[124] constructed a lattice Boltzmann model for battery thermal
management at low temperatures based on PCM. They found that
three factors help to decelerate the solidification process of PCM
and preserve battery temperature in cold climates, namely lower
thermal conductivity, greater latent heat, and higher environmen-
tal temperature. Nevertheless, larger latent heat was pointed out
to cause more severe temperature mal-distribution within the cell,
which is likely to shorten the life span of the battery.

However, the heat released from the natural solidification pro-
cess  of  PCM  can  only  delay  battery  temperature  drop  in  a  cold
climate, which is effective in short-term parking cases of EV but
may not be applicable in a long-term stop situation. The research
of  Ghadbeigi  et  al.  shows  a  tradeoff between  keeping  the  bat-
tery temperature and delaying the battery warm-up when applying
PCMs to manage battery temperature in a cold environment [125] .
Their results indicate that paraffin wax, with low thermal conduc-
tivity, is effective in keeping the battery module warm in a short
stop (10 min) at −17 °C but could slow the battery warm-up pro-
cess after a long cold stop (2 h). Paraffin-graphite composite with
high thermal conductivity, however, could not even keep the bat-
tery temperature during a short stop. Therefore, the net benefits
brought by the natural solidification process of PCM depend not
only on the stop duration but also on the type of PCM utilized.
For  such  passive  thermal  management  strategies  used  for  short
term  parking,  choosing  PCM  with  appropriate  latent  heat,  melt-
ing/solidification temperature and thermal conductivity is critical
to the performance of BTMS in frigid weather since the ability of
PCM in keeping the battery temperature, eliminating the tempera-
ture mal-distribution and facilitating the battery temperature rise
after cold stop should be balanced properly.

There  are  also  cases  where  the  temperatures  of  both  battery
and PCM are close to ambient temperature after a long-term stop
in cold weather so that PCM no longer releases heat to keep the
battery  temperature.  In  such  cases,  a  built-in  heat  source  is  re-
quired to provide adequate heat for the cold start-up of EV. Dur-
ing  this  warm-up  process,  PCM  acts  as  a  heat  transfer  medium

ever, the applications of heat pipes are dependent on the cell ge-
ometry since flat cell surface could ensure better surface contact.
Moreover, temperature difference may exist along the heat conduc-
tion direction of the heat pipe, especially when the heating power
is high, which contributes to thermal gradients inside the battery
pack.

4.2.4. Burner heating

In order to avoid the battery energy consumption during heat-
ing operations in EV, especially when cabin heating is involved, re-
searchers  have  proposed  some  heating  strategies  by  making  use
of other energy sources. Cho et al. [117] presented an integrated
heating system for the thermal management of both the cabin and
the battery in EV in cold climate based on a burner, as shown in
Fig. 15 . Fuel combustion in the burner can generate an adequate
amount of heat, which could be brought out by exhaust gas. The
flow controller, a variable throttle, can control the flow of the ex-
haust  gas  to  the  air  heat  exchanger  (AHE),  the  coolant  heat  ex-
changer (CHE), or both of them. The AHE can deliver the heat from
exhausted gas to the cold air in the vehicle cabin and realize cabin
heating. The CHE, with its working fluid heated by hot exhaust gas,
can warm up the battery pack. Later, Seo et al. [118] systemati-
cally investigated the heat transfer characteristics of this integrated
heating system by considering factors such as heat exchanger ef-
fectiveness, heat transfer rate, temperature distribution, and fluid
flow  characteristics.  Their  simulation  results  validated  the  effec-
tiveness of this heating system.

To sum up, this heating method can realize efficient cabin and
battery heating without depleting the battery energy through fuel
combustion in a burner. However, incorporating such an indepen-
dent heating system to EV would significantly take up space and
increase the cost, weight as well as complexity. Besides, the appli-
cation of this heating system in BEVs is unrealistic due to the lack
of fuel tank in BEVs as well as the great complexity addition. Addi-
tionally, for safety concerns, incorporating a burner in the heating
system would bring potential fire risks to vehicles if the system is
not well designed.

4.2.5. PCM heating

PCM can absorb and release a certain amount of heat through
melting or  solidifying at  a specific temperature.  They are essen-
tially a thermal energy storage device, which can be used man-
agement  battery  temperature  in  BTMS.  The  melting  process  can
be  applied  for  heat  absorption  at  elevated  temperatures,  while
the  heat  released  by  the  solidification  process  can  be  used  for
low-temperature heating. The cooling applications of PCM in bat-
tery systems have been reviewed in [119,120] . For low-temperature
case, a PCM is able to prevent the battery temperature from drop-
ping  significantly  when  the  ambient  temperature  suddenly  de-
creases. By rejecting its latent heat to battery cells during the so-

ture  distribution  cause  a  voltage  difference  up  to  0.1 V  between
battery cells. Moreover, PCM with high thermal conductivity allows
the heat to be transferred to the battery more quickly during pre-
heating, which is able to reduce the warm-up time. However, the
thermal conductivity of conventional PCM is usually limited. In re-
cent years, adding thermally conductive materials to PCM can re-
markably improve their overall thermal performance. These CPCMs
are found to have better performance in BTMS compared to tra-
ditional PCM [130–137] . Although the current literature mainly fo-
cuses on the improved cooling effect on batteries by using these
CPCMs,  the  heating  effect  at  low  temperatures  can  also  be  en-
hanced  when  applying  this  PCM  to  battery  preheating.  In  addi-
tion to  CPCM,  there is also  a research trend of adding nanoma-
terials to PCM, to significantly enhance their thermal conductivi-
ties. Graphene [138] , CNT [139] , and metal nanoparticles [140] are
commonly used as additives in the PCM to significantly improve
thermal conductivities of the PCM.

To summarize, the PCM-based thermal management system can
only benefit batteries in a short cold stop by delaying their temper-
ature drop. For a long cold stop, built-in heat sources are needed
to provide heat for the battery temperature rise. The required ther-
mal  properties  of  PCMs  in  these  two  situations  are  different  or
even contradictory. Greater latent heat and lower thermal conduc-
tivity contribute to slower temperature decrease in a short stop but
may be detrimental in a long cold stop since they would lead to
slower warming up rate and severer temperature mal-distribution.
As such, a tradeoff needs to be made when designing PCM-based
BTMS used for both short-term and long-term parking cases. Be-
sides, since adding PCM would inevitably bring additional weight
to BTMS, PCMs with less mass are pursued as long as their thermal
properties meet the design requirement. In addition, the safety and
reliability of the coupled heating system combing PCM and heat-
ing elements could be higher than the system with pure heating
elements since the addition of PCM can prevent overheating in the
battery pack.

4.3. Summary of external heating strategies

The external heating strategies are summarized in Table 1 , with
some selected cases as the representation of each heating strategy.
The  preheating  systems  are  contrasted  in  detail  by  applying  the
performance metrics of heating.

Typically,  external  heating  methods  need  specially  designed
BTMS  to  transfer  the  heat  from  external  heat  sources  to  bat-
tery  cells  during  the  preheating  process,  where  factors  such  as
the  heat  transfer  patterns  and  routes,  the  geometry  and  layout
of  the  battery  cells,  the  properties  of  heat  transfer  media  could
affect  the  heating  performance.  Conventional  BTMS,  such  as  air
and  liquid  systems,  are  economical  for  commercial  applications
with  high  safety  and  reliability.  However,  the  low  heat  transfer
rate  and  low  heating  efficiency  are  the  main  challenges  in  ex-
ternal heating, leading to a prolonged warm-up duration and in-
creased energy consumption, especially when heating large-format
Li-ion  cells.  Moreover,  temperature  difference  within  the  battery
cell and module/pack, affected by the cell geometry, the placement
of heating elements, and the thermal conductivity of heat transfer
medium, is another critical issue in conventional BTMS.

Effort s can be made in the future to solve the aforementioned
problems  by  enhancing  heating  efficiency  in  external  preheating
systems.  Specifically,  in  convective  heating,  increasing  the  heat
transfer rate in BTMS is of great significance, which involves chang-
ing the flow manner of heat transfer medium to achieve a higher
heat transfer rate, applying novel heat transfer fluid with higher
thermal  conductivity  (e.g.  nanofluids),  as  well  as  optimizing  the
geometry of flow channels of the heat transfer medium. For con-
ductive heating, better performance can be achieved through sev-

to  heat  the  battery  and  would  also  absorb  a  certain  amount  of
heat from the built-in heat source for the use of later short cold
stop.  Rao  et  al.  [126]  compared  the  heating  effect  of  PCM  and
air on a prismatic cell from −30 °C to 10 °C. When the tempera-
tures of the warm air and the PCM are the same (50 °C), the cold
start-up  time  of  air  heating  is  6.4  times  of  PCM  heating.  Zhong
et al. [127] designed a preheating system for battery pack based
on paraffin/graphite composite phase change material (CPCM) and
insulated resistance wires, as shown in Fig. 16 . Battery cells in each
module were first wrapped with parallel resistance wires, and the
remaining space inside each module was filled with CPCM, which
can  prevent  the  temperature  of  resistance  wire  from  being  too
high. Experimental results validated that a battery module (con-
sisting  of  15  cells,  3  cells  in  series  and  5  cells  in  parallel)  can
be heated from −25 °C to 10 °C in 473 s, with 4 strips of parallel
resistance  wires,  and  in  273 s  with  5  strips  of  wires,  consuming
4151 J and 2948 J energy, respectively. He et al. [128] placed two
heat sheets at the top and bottom of a CPCM-filled battery mod-
ule, respectively, to preheat batteries from −15 °C. The heat sheets
were powered by the external power source, and their tempera-
ture could be controlled. Their experiments proved that setting the
temperature of heat sheets to 50 °C is the most energy-saving heat-
ing strategy.

The  thermal  conductivity  of  PCM  plays  a  fundamental  role
in their thermal performance for both battery heating and cool-
ing  cases.  Firstly,  it  affects  the  temperature  distribution  within
a  battery  pack  and  thus  the  battery  performance.  Ling  et  al.
[129] observed a temperature difference of 14.9 °C within a bat-
tery  pack  (consists  of  20  2.6  Ah  18650  cylindrical  cells)  using  a
low thermal-conductivity PCM when batteries were experiencing
charge/discharge cycles at −10 °C and the non-uniform tempera-

eral methods: (a) optimizing the arrangement of battery cells to
increase the effective contact area; (b) applying novel heating el-
ements  with  higher  heating  performance  (e.g.,  film-based  panel
heaters) or coefficient of performance; (c) increasing the thermal
conductivity of the heat conduction medium such as the applica-
tions of nano-enhanced PCM. Besides these, better thermal insu-
lation can also help to reduce the heat loss to the ambient envi-
ronment during the heat transfer process, which can also reduce
energy expenses during warm-up.

5. Internal heating

Internal  heating  typically  takes  advantage  of  high  battery
impedance at low temperatures to generate a large amount of elec-
trochemical heat inside the cells when applying a current. The heat
generated through the electrochemical process can directly warm
up the electrodes and electrolyte of the battery, without passing
through the battery surface from the ambient environment to the
cell interior. This strategy can heat the battery cell quickly and ho-
mogeneously from its interior with reduced heat loss to the ambi-
ent environment. In recent years, a variety of internal heating pro-
tocols have been investigated, and this section systematically ex-
plains these internal heating techniques.

5.1. Internal self-heating

In internal self-heating strategies, batteries generate heat only
through their internal resistances (i.e., ohmic resistance and polar-
ization resistance). Since charging batteries at low temperatures is
likely to incur lithium plating, batteries have to consume a propor-
tion of their stored energy to heat themselves internally through
discharging  [28] .  For  easy  implementation,  constant  current  dis-
charge  (CCD)  and  constant  voltage  discharge  (CVD)  are  the  two
common operation protocols. According to a simulation study us-
ing  ECT  coupled  model,  an  18650  cell  of  2.2  Ah  can  be  heated
from  −20 °C  to  15 °C  within  approximately  420 s  using  CCD  (2C
discharge) while it can be heated from −20 °C to 20 °C within ap-
proximately  360 s  using  CVD  (2.8 V  discharge)  [28] .  Higher  heat
generation rate can be achieved by either improving the discharge
current in CCD or lowering the discharge voltage in CVD to remark-
ably reduce the battery warm-up time. Nevertheless, high current
in CCD and low voltage in CVD should be avoided in case the bat-
tery voltage drops below the lower cutoff voltage, which leads to
over-discharge.  Further  relationships  between  the  discharge  rate,
heating time, and power consumption when using CCD were in-
vestigated by Wu et al. [141] . Their study found that both the heat-
ing time and battery energy consumption decrease exponentially
as the discharge rate increases. Their experimental results revealed
that, when using CCD, a commercial 18650 Li-ion battery of 2.6
Ah could be heated from −10 °C to 5 °C in 280 s and 1080s un-
der 2C and 1C discharge rates, respectively. The energy consump-
tion of 2C-discharge and 1C-discharge situations accounted for 15%
and 30% of the battery rated capacity, respectively. Beside CCD and
CVD, the discharge current curve can be optimized according to
different heating objectives. Du et al. [142] applied a DP approach
to optimize the discharge current in order to find a tradeoff be-
tween  the  heating  time  and  capacity  fade.  Compared  with  CCD,
to heat the battery from −10 °C to 5 °C, this optimized preheating
method using dynamic discharge current could reduce the capacity
fade, heating time, and power consumption by 5.56%, 1.82%, and
3.04%, respectively. However, the value of the dynamic discharge
current is hard to quantify for real implementation because of the
computational burden of the DP algorithm.

Internal self-heating can be combined with other external heat-
ing techniques to make full use of the output power of batteries
during heating [143,144] , sometimes in an energy-optimal fashion

[145] . Mohan et al. [145] numerically investigated the optimal dis-
charge current profile in a combined heating strategy to minimize
the battery energy consumption, where the battery was heated by
both internal heating from the inside and convective air heating
from the outside. The optimal current policy was found to be sim-
ilar to a sequence of constant voltage (CV), constant current (CC)
and  rest  phases.  The  cell  could  be  heated  from  −20 °C  to  20 °C
within 150 s by using the optimal discharge current. However, the
current value is usually uncontrollable in such a battery-powered
heating case, making it difficult to be implemented on-board.

To sum up, the internal self-heating strategy typically does not
need  heating  components  like  external  heating  and,  thus,  it  has
comparably low cost, low complexity and weight addition, high re-
liability. Low heating efficiency (less than 0.4 for CVD [28] ) is the
main limitation of the internal self-heating protocol since the bat-
tery output power has not been fully utilized to generate heat out-
side the battery cell, leading to unwanted additional energy con-
sumption  during  warm-up  process.  Also,  high  C-rate  operations
need to be used carefully to prevent cells from over-discharge as
well as avoid accelerated capacity fade, in that the discharge rate
has an exponential influence on Li-ion battery aging rate [146,147] .
Furthermore, more than 15% battery capacity consumption during
warm-up makes this strategy only applicable when battery initial
SOC is relatively high. Otherwise, the heating operation is likely to
drain the battery energy.

5.2. Mutual pulse heating

Mutual  pulse heating takes  advantage of  the battery  and an-
other energy reservoir (e.g. batteries or capacitors) to form an elec-
tric circuit and realize the charge/discharge process mutually. The
bi-directional current pulses during this process can generate heat
inside two energy reservoirs and warm up both of them from sub-
zero temperatures. In [28] , the cells in a battery pack are classi-
fied into two equal-capacity groups, with one group being charged
and the other group being discharged. When a DC-DC converter is
added between both groups, the discharge voltage of the cells can
be enhanced so that the output power of the discharge group can
be utilized as the input power for the charge group. During charg-
ing, a certain portion of the output power is capable of generating
heat inside the battery due to the existence of internal resistance,
while the remaining power is stored in charged cells and will be
used for discharging later. The charge/discharge roles of the two
battery groups change periodically by using pulse signals so that
both groups can be heated by each other and warmed up mutu-
ally. Simulation results of two battery cells showed that the cell
could be heated from −20 °C to 20 °C within less than 220 s when
setting the discharge voltage level to 2.8 V and the pulse intervals
to 1 s. This warm-up process only consumed 5% of the battery ca-
pacity.

The  current  profiles  in  the  charge/discharge  process  can  also
be optimized to maximize heating efficiency. Mohan et al. [148–
150]  optimized  the  bi-directional  current  profiles  by  using  the
warm-up time and energy consumption as objectives. Instead of
using a target temperature as an indicator of terminating a pre-
heating process, they estimated the battery pulse power capability
to determine when the heating should be ended. Results showed
that the total energy consumption using CVD is 35% more than this
pulse current heating method.

For real EV preheating applications, a Li-ion battery heating sys-
tem was developed by using an inverter and a motor between the
battery and a smoothing capacitor [151] . By adding a relay in the
system, the insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBT) can be con-
trolled to achieve the charging/discharging processes repeatedly to
warm up the battery from low-temperature extreme. This method

can heat the battery from −20 °C to 0 °C in 5 min and extend the
driving range of a PHEV by 13 km.

To  sum  up,  mutual  pulse  heating  makes  full  use  of  the
charge/discharge processes between the  battery  and another en-
ergy storage device to warm up the battery cells. The output power
of the battery and the energy storage device in the heating sys-
tem has not been wasted compared to internal self-heating so that
the energy consumption could be less than 10% of battery capac-
ity, and the warm-up time is usually within 5 min. Moreover, this
heating process is highly efficient, with heating efficiency higher
than  0.7  even  when  the  DC-DC  converter  efficiency  is  only  80%
[28] . Nevertheless, some limitations of this heating technique also
exist [28] . Mutual pulse heating at high initial SOC levels and us-
ing longer pulse intervals are likely to increase the risk of lithium
plating, which gives rise to the preference of heating with high-
frequency pulses. In addition, the mutual pulse operation needs a
complicated circuit and control system, which would increase the
number of components as well as the system cost and complexity,
particularly in a large-scale integrated battery system.

5.3. Self-Heating lithium-ion battery

In  2016,  Wang  et  al.  [34,152]  first  proposed  a  novel  battery
structure by embedding a thin nickel foil with certain electrical re-
sistance as the internal heating element inside the battery to warm
up the cell at low temperatures. The structure of this all-climate
battery (ACB), also called SHLB, is shown in Fig. 17 (a). The nickel
foil has two tabs, one of which is welded together with the tabs
at the anode, being electrically connected to the negative termi-
nal, while the other extends out from the battery to form a third
terminal, the activation terminal (ACT). The working principle of
this ACB is illustrated in Fig. 17 (b) using electric circuit represen-
tation. A switch connecting the ACT with the positive terminal can
be controlled according to the cell surface temperature. The switch
is left closed only when the battery temperature is low, forcing the
current flow through the nickel foil so that large amounts of ohmic
heat can be generated to warm the battery internally. Once the tar-
get temperature is reached, the heating process is completed, and
the switch remains open to make electrons bypass the nickel foil.
In this situation, the nickel foil no longer generates heat, and the
battery can be charged or discharged as a conventional Li-ion bat-
tery with its performance restored.

The activation process allows the temperature of the cell to rise
quickly  within  seconds,  which  creates  favorable  electrochemistry
inside the battery for charge/discharge as well as restores the cell
energy and power capabilities. Results showed that the 7.5 Ah ACB
cell can be heated from −20 °C and −30 °C to a surface tempera-
ture of 0 °C in 19.5 s and 29.6 s, consuming 3.8% and 5.5% of cell
capacity, respectively [34] . Besides, the available 1C discharge en-
ergy of the cell could reach 102 Wh kg −1 after activation at −40 °C
while the cell without nickel foil could only have 0.3 Wh kg −1 and
the discharge power after activation at −30 °C was found to be 5–

6 times than the conventional cell at the same temperature [34] .
Apart  from  discharging,  pulses  of  charge  and  discharge  currents
can  also  be  utilized  during  the  activation  process  for  lower  en-
ergy consumption when the external power source is accessible.
The  ACB  cell  can  be  heated  from  −10 °C,  −20 °C,  and  −30 °C  to
10 °C in 54 s, 77 s, and 90 s using pulse activation, respectively, con-
suming less than 2% battery capacity [152] . The current waveforms
and duration can be further optimized for less activation time and
energy consumption. Furthermore, Zhang et al. [154] proposed an
active control strategy for activation called “battery heating while
driving” during driving cycles, without waiting for battery warm-
up in advance. The control strategy involved heating the battery
internally during regenerative braking and rest periods when bat-
tery temperature was lower than the pre-set temperature. In the
case of braking, the switch was left closed so that the external cur-
rent from regenerative braking can flow through the nickel foil for
heating. During rest periods, the switch still remained closed and
the SHLB can discharge through the nickel foil as a reinforced sup-
plement for previous heating. Results showed that the cell could
be heated from 0 °C, −10 °C, −20 °C, −30 °C and −40 °C to 10 °C in
13 s, 33 s, 46 s, 56 s and 112 s, respectively.

In  SHLB,  the  majority  of  heat  generation  inside  the  battery
comes from the ohmic heat produced by the nickel foil, accounting
for 78% on average during the activation process [155] . After such
intense  heat  generation,  the  temperature  uniformity  of  the  cell,
which could affect cell performance, is much concerned. Along the
in-plane direction, time-sequential images obtained from infrared
thermography shows a uniform temperature distribution over the
active electrode area during activation but also a hot spot on the
ACT  as  well  as  a  large  temperature  gradient  at  the  edge  [156] .
Along  the  through-plane  direction,  a  large  temperature  gradient
exists from the nickel foil to the outer surface due to insufficient
heat transfer. Experimental results showed that when the surface
temperature of the cell rose to 0 °C after activation, the tempera-
ture of the internal nickel foil could reach up to 30 °C [155] . Such a

large through-plane temperature gradient was pointed out to trig-
ger non-uniform current distribution and even affect heating time
and energy consumption [155] .

In order to reduce the temperature gradient inside the SHLB,
considerable effort s have been made either in cell structure and
cell operation. Yang et al. [155] optimized the SHLB structure by
adding more nickel sheets to the battery in the through-plane di-
rection,  instead  of  a  single  foil  in  the  center.  The  structure  of  a
multi-sheet SHLB is shown in Fig. 18 (a) and (b). Results revealed
that the local temperature gradient inside the SHLB during the ac-
tivation process could be greatly reduced by adding more nickel
foils, as shown in Fig. 18 (c) – (e). The maximum temperature dif-
ference inside a three-sheet SHLB could be controlled within 5 °C.
In addition, due to cell structure improvement, higher heating ef-
ficiency could be achieved, with the activation time reduced by up
to 30% and the energy consumption reduced by up to 27%. A de-
tailed comparison of the single-sheet, two-sheet, and three-sheet
SHLB in terms of the heating time and the energy consumption is
listed in Table 2 for a straightforward reference. Other methods,
such as changing the heating protocol of the SHLB, were also re-
ported to reduce the temperature gradient inside SHLB. Lei et al.
[157]  proposed  an  intermittent  heating  method  for  SHLB  at  low
temperatures. Instead of continuous heating, the Li-ion battery was

heated by cycles of heating and rest. A three-dimensional finite el-
ement model indicated that during 30-second heating at −20 °C,
heating for 0.1 s and then rest for 0.3 s can effectively decrease the
temperature difference to 2–3 °C, compared to the temperature dif-
ference of 10–11 °C in continuous heating case.

Although temperature difference exists inside SHLB during the
activation  process,  the  SHLB  heating  method  still  exhibits  better
temperature uniformity than traditional external heating. Lei et al.
[158] compared the two-sheet SHLB heating and wide-line metal
film heating by using transient three-dimensional heating finite el-
ement models. Their results showed that the maximum through-
plane temperature difference using wide-line metal films could be
three times higher than that using SHLB heating. Besides, they also
pointed out that decreasing the heating power and cell thickness
can improve temperature uniformity. For large-size Li-ion batter-
ies, the advantage of SHLB heating becomes remarkable. Yang et al.
[159] compared conventional external heating strategies, using cell
resistance and external electric heater, with the multi-sheet SHLB
heating  of  40  Ah  Li-ion  batteries  with  34 mm  thickness.  Results
showed that the multi-sheet SHLB heating could achieve more uni-
form  temperature  distribution  and  much  less  heating  time  with
comparable battery energy consumption in external heating. More-
over, their study also revealed that increasing the heating power
in conventional external heating would increase the through-plane
temperature gradient and result in local overheating, especially in
thick battery cells.

The  rapid  heating  capability  of  SHLB  enables  the  fast  charg-
ing  with  high  charge  rate  after  the  activation  process  without
lithium plating, which substantially reduces the total time for bat-
tery warm-up and charging [152,160] . Yang et al. [160] leveraged
the  SHLB  structure  to  propose  a  control  strategy  that  can  pre-
heat and charge the cell rapidly. According to the proposed strat-
egy,  the  cell  was warmed up  from an extreme  low temperature
to  a  lithium  plating-free  (LPF)  temperature,  by  applying  an  ex-
ternal  power  source  with  constant  voltage  (slightly  lower  than
cell open-circuit voltage) between the positive and negative termi-
nals of SHLB with the switch keeping closed. Then fast charging
could be fulfilled once the temperature of the cell reached the LPF
value. They demonstrated that a 9.5 Ah SHLB structure cell can be
charged to 80% state of charge (SOC) within 15 min even at −50 °C,
through this process. Therefore, the rapid heating and charging ca-
pability of SHLB exhibits great potential in counteracting the prob-
lems due to low temperatures, facilitating the application of EV in
cold geographical regions.

The cycle life of SHLB has been improved since the internal pre-
heating  procedure  prior  to  operation  can  reduce  lithium  plating
in the later charging process. At low temperatures, the degrada-
tion of SHLB mainly comes from normal electrochemical cycling,
while conventional cells usually suffer from lithium plating so that
their  capacity  decreases  drastically  during  cycling  [152] .  A  well-
controlled preheating-charging process can make SHLB withstand
4500 cycles with high-rate (3.5 C) charging current with reported
capacity fade less than 20% at 0 °C [160] .

To summarize, the rapid heating ability, small energy consump-
tion, extended cycle life, and high charge acceptance make SHLB
a paradigm in low-temperature applications of automotive Li-ion
batteries. However, disadvantages also exist due to cell structural
change.  Invasive  battery  cell  structural  changes  are  required,  as
well as additional controls and switches between battery terminals
needed during the operation. This inevitably increases the cost of
battery and control complexity, especially for the large-scale inte-
gration of SHLBs in EV. Besides, for safety concerns, meticulous op-
eration and precise temperature monitor are essential for the acti-
vation process of SHLB to prevent the cell from being over-heated
due to the large heat generation rate inside the cell. These two un-
favorable factors can reduce the safety and reliability of the BTMS.

5.4. Alternating current heating

AC  heating typically applies an AC  as the input signal at  the
battery terminals to generate heat inside the cell. The fast and pe-
riodical charging/discharging processes enable the battery to keep
its SOC relatively stable. Different from the aforementioned three
internal  preheating  categories,  this  sort  of  strategy  can  be  usu-
ally  achieved  without  extra  battery  energy  consumption  during
warm-up by using an external power source. Moreover, AC heating
was demonstrated to be one of the most efficient preheating ap-
proaches, which can heat the battery quickly and uniformly, com-
pared with external warm-up strategies [57,58] . Among various AC
signals, sinusoidal alternating current (SAC) is the most commonly
used AC heating, and its current amplitude and frequency can be
adjusted for greater heat generation inside the cell.

Hande et al. [161–164] first investigated the feasibility of us-
ing 10–20 kHz AC to heat automotive nickel-metal hydride (NiMH)
at  low  temperatures  and  found  that  the  cells  could  be  heated
from subzero temperature to room temperature within 8 min. Ji
et  al.  [28]  proposed  an  AC  heating  strategy  based  on  the  elec-
trochemistry  of  Li-ion  batteries.  An  ECT  coupled  model  was  ap-
plied  to  investigate  the  characteristics  of  the  warm-up  effect  by
applying  AC.  Their  results  showed  that  using  a  voltage  signal
V ( t ) = 3.8 − cos (2 π ft ), the cell can be heated from −20 °C to 20 °C in
340 s, when the frequency of voltage signal is 0.01 Hz and the cell
surface is assumed to be adiabatic. The warm-up duration can be
further reduced by increasing the signal frequency, and the associ-
ated heating times are 170 s and 80 s with frequencies of 60 Hz and
10 0 0 Hz, respectively. Besides, two frequency regions, namely 0.01–
0.1 Hz and 1–10 0 0 Hz, were recommended to reduce the heating
time at low temperatures.

The  warm-up  time  of  SAC  heating  is  largely  dependent  on
the  current  parameters  such  as  amplitude  and  frequency  since
these  two  parameters  can  affect  the  heat  generation  rate  inside
the battery cell. Specifically, the current amplitude can directly af-
fect the heat generation inside the battery cell, while the battery
impedance often varies with current frequency and cell tempera-
ture [47] . In the current literature, effort s have been made to study
the influence of SAC parameters on the preheating effect. Zhang
et al. [47] revealed the relationship between SAC parameters and
battery warm-up time based on a heat generation model in the
frequency  domain.  The  heat  generation  rate  inside  the  cell  was
calculated based on current amplitude, current frequency and the
impedance of an equivalent electrical circuit (EEC) battery model,
which is shown in Fig. 19 (a). The effect of SAC parameters on heat-
ing effect under different heat transfer conditions was illustrated
with  contours  of  heating  time,  as  shown  in  Fig.  19 (b)–(d).  They
pointed  out  that  the  increase  of  SAC  amplitude,  the  decrease  of
current frequency, and the improvement of thermal insulation con-
ditions could shorten the preheating time. Furthermore, they also
concluded from these contours that the current amplitude has a
greater impact on the preheating time than the frequency in low-
amplitude and low-frequency range, whereas, in the high range of
both parameters, the frequency is more decisive [47] .

To shorten battery warm-up time and maximize heat genera-
tion  inside  the  battery,  the  current  amplitude  and  frequency  of
the  applied  SAC  need  to  be  adjusted  to  suitable  values  accord-
ing to cell temperature. Ruan et al. pointed out that applying SAC
with a constant frequency to warm up the battery is much more
feasible than using varied frequencies for engineering applications
[165] . They investigated the optimal SAC frequency for the max-
imum heat generation rate during the overall preheating process
at different temperatures, based on a reduced electro-thermal cou-
pled  (RETC)  model  [166] .  Li  et  al.  [167]  concluded  from  experi-
ments that low-frequency SAC within 100 Hz could heat the bat-
tery effectively from low temperatures.

Since regulating the current frequency during the AC heating
process is  difficult  to  realize, a mainstream approach to  acceler-
ating the temperature rise of Li-ion battery cells is to adjust the
current amplitude, once the SAC frequency has been determined.
Besides, when the battery temperature is rising, the heat genera-
tion rate inside the cell would gradually decline with the decrease
of its impedance if the current amplitude remains constant. There-
fore, the amplitude of SAC needs to be adjusted during the pre-
heating process. The key issue of this current regulation is to max-
imize the internal heat generation rate without producing detri-
mental effects on battery health. Therefore, constraints are usually
imposed to restrict the maximum current amplitude to guarantee
battery health. Ge et al. [33] adopted lithium plating as the con-
straint to adjust the current amplitude of SAC and proposed a step-
wise preheating method at low temperatures. Through calculating
the over-potential at the anode area of a three-electrode Li-ion bat-
tery and maintaining it positive, the maximum allowable current
amplitude with lithium plating prevention was determined, which
was found to increase with the rise of the current frequency as

well as the battery temperature. The amplitude of the SAC in each
preheating step could be modified according to the battery temper-
ature. Results showed that the 1 Ah pouch cell in the study could
be heated from −20 °C to 5 °C within 80 0 s at a 10 0 Hz frequency.
Ruan et al. used the polarization voltage in the RETC model as the
constraint to restrict the maximum current amplitude based on a
constant SAC frequency [165] . Their results showed that under the
current frequency of 1377 Hz (the optimal frequency for the over-
all preheating process), the battery can be heated from −15.4 °C
to  5.6 °C  in  338 s.  Guo  et  al.  [46,168]  used  the  battery  terminal
voltage as the constraint to develop a preheating strategy based
on amplitude-variable SAC profiles. The dynamic terminal voltage
of the battery, which was described by applying the Butler-Volmer
equation, was restricted between the minimum and the maximum
voltage limits  during  the  preheating process to  prevent the  bat-
tery from over-discharge and over-charge. The optimal input cur-
rent amplitude was calculated in a timely manner to maximize the
heat generation inside the cell after selecting a suitable frequency.
Experimental  results  showed  that  a  single  battery  cell  could  be

heated from −20.3 °C to 10.02 °C in 13.7 min while the battery pack
with four cells in series could be heated from −20.84 °C to 10 °C in
12.4 min, with SAC frequency of 10 Hz.

Apart from SAC, other AC waveforms such as rectangular wave
and  step-growth  wave  were  also  applied  for  battery  preheating.
Zhao et al. [169] excited batteries using current pulses with charge
rates 0.75–2 C and discharge rates 3–4 C before CC –CV charging
at  the  subzero  environment.  The  battery  could  be  heated  from
−10 °C  to  3 °C  in  10  pulse  cycles.  Ruan  et  al.  [170]  synthesized
a  step-growth  charge  current  and  a  constant  discharge  current,
where  the  duration  of  charge  and  discharge  process  was  set  to
be 4 ms, to internally warm the battery up. Specifically, the am-
plitude of the charge current had a stair increase; every time the
battery  temperature  increased  by  2 °C  and  the  amplitude  of  the
discharge current remained unchanged. This method allowed the
battery to achieve an approximately linear temperature rise over
time. Results showed that a 35 Ah battery could be heated from
−10 °C to 2 °C within 18 min. Zhu et al. [171] compared the effects
of current waveforms (sinusoidal and rectangular current profiles)
on  the  temperature  change  of  a  2.3  Ah  18650  battery.  For  both
current profiles (10 A, 30 Hz, and 600 s heating time), the battery
can be heated from −24 °C to 7.79 °C using the sinusoidal current,
and from −24 °C to 25.6 °C using rectangular current. This result
was due to a higher root mean square (RMS) value of the rectan-
gular current profile. Zuniga et al. [172] applied a low-frequency
(0.01 Hz) square-wave current to preheat a 100 Ah prismatic cell
and compared this strategy with an external heating option, i.e.,
sandwiching  the  prismatic  cell  with  two  electric  heating  pads.
Given the same heating power of 50 W and heating time of 1800s,
although both heating strategies exhibited a similar cell tempera-
ture rise (from −20 °C to 14.9–15.9 °C), square-wave current heat-
ing could achieve more quick temperature rise of the battery core
than that in external heating.

While most AC heating strategies typically require EV to have
access to external power sources such as charging stands, there is
a trend to develop onboard AC heating method by designing a spe-
cific electrical circuit to generate AC without external power sup-
ply, which can effectively reduce the inconvenience of AC heating
caused by insufficient external power facilities. Jiang et al. [49] de-
signed a soft-switching resonance circuit to generate AC by using
battery power. This resonance circuit can generate both AC and di-
rect current so that the superimposed current is able to internally
heat  a  large-size  automotive  Li-ion  battery  pack  (12  35Ah  lam-
inated  batteries  connected  in  series)  with  lithium  plating  avoid-
ance, in which the current limitations were developed based on a
battery EEC model. The whole battery pack could be heated from
−20.8 °C to 2.1 °C within 600 s with battery energy consumption
of 6.64%. The maximum temperature difference in the pack was
less than 1.6 °C during preheating. Shang et al. designed various
electric circuits to realize onboard AC heating [173–175] . A peri-
odic ramped discharged current with a certain amplitude and fre-
quency can be generated through the designed circuits and preheat
Li-ion batteries from −20 °C to 0 °C within several minutes, with
less than 5% of battery energy consumption.

Although the AC heating process can warm up the Li-ion bat-
tery  quickly  and  uniformly  from  low  temperatures,  the  effect  of
AC heating on battery aging is still the main concern, yet the re-
lated works are limited. AC parameters, especially the current am-
plitude and frequency, would affect internal electrochemistry of Li-
ion battery and need to be systematically investigated with respect
to  their  effect  on  the  battery  aging  mechanism.  In  most  works,
the current amplitude is the main factor to influence the occur-
rence of lithium plating during AC heating because it directly af-
fects the anode potential [33,49,165] . The current frequency was
found  to  affect  the  kinetic  and  transport  process  of  Li-ion  cells
[28] . Zhu et al. [171] provided a possible model to explain the ef-

fect of AC heating on battery aging. At high frequencies, the charge
transfer and the diffusion process are bypassed due to short exci-
tation duration so that lithium plating does not occur, as shown
in  Fig.  20 (a).  With  the  decrease  of  current  frequency,  both  pro-
cesses become active, but the intercalated lithium ions during the
charging process would de-intercalate during the subsequent dis-
charging period. Thus there is no dead lithium produced, as shown
in Fig. 20 (b). At low frequencies, when the current amplitude be-
comes increases, the produced lithium cannot be fully de-lithiated
during  the  prolonged  AC  excitation  period  due  to  complex  and
nonlinear electrochemical reactions. With some side reactions, the
dead lithium could be created, causing irreversible battery capacity
loss, as shown in Fig. 20 (c).

To experimentally investigate the effect of AC heating on bat-
tery aging, most of the literature focuses on short-term degrada-
tion by examining the battery capacity after tens of heating cy-
cles [46,47,165] . The capacity tests of the battery showed a slight
variation of charge/discharge capacity after AC heating cycles, sug-
gesting no occurrence of apparent battery degradation in the short
term [46,165] . The long-term effect of AC heating on battery degra-
dation  has  not  yet  been  investigated  until  recently.  Guo  et  al.
[176] investigated the aging effect of 210 repeated AC heating cy-
cles (amplitude-varying AC after optimization at a high frequency
of 530 Hz) on a three-electrode Li-ion battery at −20 °C by apply-
ing capacity calibration and incremental capacity analysis, which
show no detrimental effect on cell health. Zhu et al. [32] system-
atically explored the effect of AC heating on the battery state of
health (SOH) at −25 °C through 240 AC heating cycles. Tests of the
battery  capacity,  DC  resistance,  electrochemical  impedance  spec-
troscopy  (EIS),  and  observations  of  battery  internal  morphology
after  disassembly  indicated  that  irreversible  battery  damage  did
not occur after 240 AC heating cycles even with a low frequency
(0.5 Hz), as long as the battery voltage limits (3.7 V/2.5 V) were sat-
isfied. Jiang et al. [49] explored the effect of AC on the lifetime of
a large-format Li-ion battery pack by repeating 600 heating cycles
at −20 °C. Battery consistency variation, capacity loss, and resis-
tance increase were not found to be obvious in such a pack level.
So far, AC heating approaches have been validated to be effective
and  benign  to  Li-ion  batteries  at  extremely  low  temperatures,  if
the current parameters are selected properly.

To sum up, typical AC heating with well-selected current pa-
rameters  can  achieve  safe,  efficient  and  reliable  heating  at  low
temperatures without consuming battery energy. Besides, the heat-
ing  circuit  is  quite  simple,  which  eliminates  the  addition  of  ex-
tra components and thus has low cost and complexity. Neverthe-
less,  the  adoption  of  AC  source  during  heating  requires  the  EV
to have access to external power sources except that the EV has
equipped with an onboard AC generation circuit. More importantly,
until  now,  the  effect  of  AC  heating  on  Li-ion  battery  aging  has
not  been  investigated  thoroughly  from  perspectives  of  the  elec-
trochemical  mechanism  but  only  been  experimentally  examined
through battery capacity analysis after repeated preheating cycles.
Understanding  the  effect  of  AC  current  on  battery  aging  behav-
ior could achieve battery warm-up towards a more efficient and
health-conscious way. Furthermore, for module/pack level, the cell
resistance inconsistency gives rise to different heat generation rate
inside each cell and thus cause a temperature gradient inside the
battery module/pack.

5.5. Summary of internal heating strategies

The internal heating strategies are summarized in Table 3 , with
some selected cases as the representation of each heating strategy.
The  preheating  systems  are  contrasted  in  detail  by  applying  the
performance metrics of heating.

Generally,  internal  heating  strategies  heat  a  battery  quickly
with low system complexity since heat is generated directly inside
the battery, and this process does not need a long heat transfer
route compared to external heating. The heating time of these ap-
proaches varies from tens to hundreds of seconds, which is shorter
than that in most external heating strategies. Among the four types
of internal heating methods, only the AC heating uses an external
power source in most situations, whereas the others need to con-
sume battery energy. One of the main concerns for internal heat-
ing strategies lies in concomitant battery degradation. For internal
self-heating  and  SHLB,  since  the  battery  discharges  during  heat-
ing, direct damage such as lithium plating does not happen, but
high rate operations will aggravate aging in the long term. For the
mutual pulse heating, using a low pulse frequency and heating at
a high initial SOC should be circumvented since both of them in-
crease the risk of lithium plating. For the AC heating, the current
with a low frequency should be used cautiously with additional
limitations (such as voltage bounds) to avoid irreversible damage
to the battery. Using a high frequency in AC heating is conducive
to reducing battery capacity loss.

6. Remarks and future trends

The ultimate goal of battery warm-up is to restore the battery
performance  as  quickly  as  possible  in  cold  climates,  taking  into
account energy consumption, resultant battery aging, temperature
uniformity, overall cost, system complexity, safety, and reliability.
It  is  highly  anticipated  that  the  continual  improvements  of  bat-
tery preheating strategies will help EV to handle various climate
conditions in different regions over the world. As discussed exten-
sively previously, the various battery preheating strategies exhibit

pros and cons. These strategies are qualitatively compared in terms
of meeting design requirements (a)-(g), as listed in Table 4 .

External  heating  strategies  typically  require  a  customized  ex-
ternal thermal management system that considers the cell geom-
etry and arrangement. Their energy consumption, preheating du-
ration, effects on battery aging and temperature uniformity often
vary  from  method  to  method.  Generally,  air  and  liquid  manage-
ment have been primarily adopted in commercial EVs due to their
maturity with relatively low cost, high safety, and reliability. Both
strategies have excellent compatibility with the off-the-shelf cool-
ing systems, so that slight changes are required to be made to the
original system.  Heating methods  with  resistors,  heat  pipes,  and
PCM are still in the laboratory stage and need further investiga-
tions, even though their heating performance sometimes is better
than air and liquid management. Other techniques, such as heat
pump heating, Peltier-effect heating, and burner heating, are three
possible solutions, but their heating performance still remains to
be examined. However, low heating efficiency is the major chal-
lenge for external heating, which leads to increased energy con-
sumption and prolonged heating time. Besides, temperature uni-
formity and weight increase are also inferior, compared to internal
heating.

Internal heating techniques typically warm up batteries faster
and more uniformly, with other advantages in terms of energy con-
sumption, temperature uniformity, cost, and weight increase. How-
ever, all of these heating technologies have not been commercial-
ized due to their immaturity in the battery module/pack level. The
internal  self-heating  can  be  applied  during  the  driving  to  main-
tain the battery temperature, in which the battery output power
can be used for the operation of other onboard electronics. Mutual
pulse heating can be applied in the presence of an ultra-capacitor
to  generate  current  pulses  to  preheat  batteries,  but  pulse  dura-

tion and amplitude need to be modulated to avoid lithium-plating.
SHLB and AC heating could achieve a satisfactory tradeoff in heat-
ing performance. However, for SHLB, different battery manufactur-
ing, packaging, and management techniques are required for large-
scale applications, while for AC heating, insights into the heating
management of the large modules/packs are still lacking.

Despite  the  extensive  research  progress  made  so  far,  how  to
preheat  batteries  from  subzero  temperatures  efficiently  is  still  a
challenge and remains to be unsolved. Thus the future trends are
suggested  from  the  following  aspects  to  encourage  more  break-
throughs in this research area:

• The heat transfer process in the battery preheating system
needs to be comprehensively designed from thermal science
perspectives  to  enhance  the  heating  performance,  particu-
larly  in  external  heating.  The  heat  transfer  path  and  pat-
terns are required to be optimized in order to reduce the
heat transfer distance, enhance the heat transfer coefficient,
and minimize the unwanted heat loss to the ambient envi-
ronment. Therefore, better thermal insulation, adding more
thermally conductive materials (e.g., nanofluids and CPCM),
and applying more thermally efficient heating elements (e.g.,
heat  pumps  and  film-based  panel  heaters)  would  also  be
beneficial to such preheating systems.

• The development of model-based control strategies in BTMS
can achieve optimal battery heating for both external and in-
ternal heating. Current studies primarily focus on the design
of  preheating  systems  and  the  exploration  of  novel  heat-
ing approaches. Although some inherent parameters of such
heating systems have been investigated in terms of their ef-
fects on heating performance, the control optimality, which
helps to achieve better heating performance through heating
process controls, has seldom been studied [144,145,148,150] .
Nevertheless, model-based preheating control strategies typ-
ically  require  applicable  models  that  are  suitable  for  con-
trol and implementation. Therefore, the key challenge is to
develop control-orientated battery preheating models with
adequate accuracy as well as high computational efficiency,
during which precise modeling of battery thermal behavior
(at  the  cell,  module,  and  pack  level), system  heat  transfer
characteristics, and system heat generation are necessary.
• The preheating strategies need to be further explored in a
battery module/pack level since cell temperature homogene-
ity  in  a  pack  is  critical  to  the  overall  performance  of  the
battery pack and would affect its aging processes. If there
is  no  heat  generation  inside  the  battery  pack,  namely  the
battery heating is a pure heat transfer problem, the effect
of surrounding-to-cell heat interaction characteristic on the
temperature uniformity of the pack can be studied. If heat is
generated inside the battery pack, different cell heat gener-
ation amounts caused by cell resistance inconsistency could
contribute to the thermal gradient inside the pack and, thus,
need to be considered.

• The effect of preheating on battery aging remains to be in-
vestigated systematically, especially for AC heating. The ef-
fect of current parameters such as amplitude and frequency
on battery aging needs to be studied from a perspective of
electrochemical mechanisms inside a Li-ion battery. Electro-
chemical  models  governing  the  kinetic  and  transport  pro-
cesses at the anode under an AC signal load can be estab-
lished to reveal the effects of AC parameters on aging in an
explicit manner. In this way, the ultimate current limits in
AC heating could be fully explored to boost heating perfor-
mance  without  harming  the  battery,  making  AC  heating  a
favorable paradigm in battery low-temperature applications.

7. Conclusions

This  paper  presents  the  state-of-the-art  preheating  strategies
for automotive Li-ion batteries at subzero temperatures. First, the
effect  of  low  temperatures  on  battery  performance  and  material
properties  are  reviewed  briefly.  Second,  the  thermal  science  in-
volved in battery warm-up, the key design factors for battery heat-
ing,  as  well  as  the  classification  of  warm-up  methods,  are  elu-
cidated.  Two  categories  of  heating  approaches,  namely  external
heating, and internal heating, are systematically reviewed in terms
of their underlying principle, strengths, weaknesses, and potential
improvements.  Finally,  a  qualitative  comparison  of  these  heating
strategies has been made based on the performance metrics and
their technique maturity. Additionally, some important future re-
search trends are also provided.
