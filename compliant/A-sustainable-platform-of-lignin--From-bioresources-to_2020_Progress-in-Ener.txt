Lignin, as a renewable bioresource, has been widely explored in cellulosic biofuel and several other in-
dustries. There are limited applications of lignin in the energy industry, especially in rechargeable bat-
teries and supercapacitors, even though tremendous research work has been done regarding the use of
lignin in these fields. It is vital to take lignin into consideration because its usage not only improves the
performance of these devices but also reduces the cost, contributing to obtaining more sustainable and
greener energy devices. This paper reviews recent developments of lignin-derived materials in recharge-
able batteries and supercapacitors. It starts with a brief introduction of the benefits of lignin, followed
by the fundamental nature and preparation of lignin-derived materials. Significant attention is paid to
applications of lignin-derived materials in rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors including their use
as binders and electrodes for rechargeable batteries, and electrodes and electrolytes for supercapacitors
with a focus on the mechanisms behind their operation. The goal is to provide a detailed review of the
critical aspects related to lignin utilized as an important resource for researchers working in a diverse
range of fields dealing with energy storage and conversion. Lastly, a future vision on challenges and their
possible solutions are presented.

1. Introduction

Energy storage systems are essential for the extensive research
of  portable  electronic  devices,  electric/hybrid  vehicles,  etc.  due
to  the  continuously  increasing  demand  of  the  world  energy
consumption caused by fast industrial developments and human
population growth [1–8] . However, the intensive use of fossil fuels
has led to environmental issues such as global warming and envi-
ronmental pollution [9–12] . Renewable energy sources, which offer
an alternative to the consumption of fossil fuels while protecting
the environment and resolving these issues at the global level, are
highly demanded in this regard [13–21] .

Lignin,  a  heterogeneous  and  amorphous  polymer  that  consti-
tutes a large portion of plants, is one of the prospective candidates
because  of  its  low  cost  and  bio-renewable  nature  [22–24] .  De-
spite the huge potentials, lignin technologies have not been fully
developed  so  far,  and  lignin-based  materials  are  not  utilized  as
high-value  products  [23,25] .  Only  a  very  tiny  fraction,  less  than
2 wt.%,  of  the  approximately  70  million  tons  of  lignin  produced
during the extraction of cellulose for the paper industry is utilized
as concrete additives, stabilizing agents or dispersants and surfac-
tants [25,26] . The remainder is simply discarded as waste or burnt
as low-grade burning fuel.

Lignin  is  inexpensive  and  possesses  numerous  attractive
properties,  including  high  carbon  content,  high  thermal  stabil-
ity,  biodegradability,  antioxidant  activity,  and  favorable  stiffness
[27–30] . These advantages have motivated interests in developing
lignin into value-added products for various applications in energy
storage  systems.  Comprehensive  research  work  has  been  carried
out  to  concentrate  on  two  imperative  energy  storage  systems,
which are rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors, respectively,
even  though  the  strategy  to  design  effective  energy  storage  de-
vices  with  acceptable  energy  density,  long-term  durability,  and
high safety is a challenging area of research [31,32] .

This review intends to provide an overview of recent research
on the conversion of lignin to high-value products applied in the
fields of rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors. It starts with
a brief introduction of the advantages of lignin, followed by the
fundamental  nature  and  preparation  of  lignin-derived  materials.
The review then highlights the applications of lignin-derived ma-
terials in rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors, focusing on
mechanisms behind their operation. A future vision on challenges
and their possible solutions are presented at the end.

2. Nature of lignin

With the growing crisis of oil resources, lignin, as one of the
main  components  in  biomass,  has  attracted  tremendous  atten-
tion  in  the  last  few  decades  [33,34] .  Fundamental  properties  of
lignin should be comprehensively understood prior to its practical
applications. Therefore, we first introduce the origin and biosyn-
thesis  paths  of  lignin  in  this  section,  then  discuss  its  chemical

structures  including  monolignol,  linkages  between  monolignols
and  functional  groups.  More  details  regarding  the  analysis  of
various  lignin  preparation  methods  are  provided.  At  last,  the
advantages  of  lignin  are  described,  especially  for  applications  in
the area of rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors.

2.1. Origin and synthesis of lignin

Existing  in  most  vascular  plants,  lignin  is  an  amorphous
three-dimensional  (3D)  macromolecule  which  connects  different
kinds of methoxylated phenylpropanoid units by ether bonds and
carbon-carbon  bonds  [35–43] .  As  a  main  component  of  plants,
lignin is interweaved chemically with hemicellulose and wrapped
subsequently outside of cellulose fibers, as shown in Fig. 1 [43] .
The range of lignin content in biomass is 15–30 wt.%, and softwood
is supposed to have the highest lignin content among all the plant
species, which can be up to 30 wt.%  [37,39,40] . The content and
structure  of  lignin  highly  depend  on  the  type  (i.e.,  softwood,
hardwood,  grass  plant,  etc.)  and  the  part  (i.e.,  stalks,  leaves,
husks,  seeds,  etc.)  of  various  plants,  as  well  as  lignin  extraction
methods  [41,42] .  The  functionalities  of  lignin  in  plants  include
structural support with rigidity and strength, transportation corri-
dor of water and nutrient, a recalcitrant barrier against pests, and
microorganisms.

Although lignin stock in biomass ranks second to cellulose, very
less of annual lignin output in the whole world has been commer-
cially  utilized  in  the  area  of  materials  engineering and  chemical
industry  [37,44] .  The  reason  for  this  situation  mainly  attributes
to two sides: one is structural complexity and diversity of lignin
production,  which  exist  in  different  biomass  types  and  pretreat-
ment processes [45,46] ; the other is the limitation of unmodified
lignin in the aspect of broad molecular weight distribution, poor
solubility, and incompatibility with host matrices [38] .

Owing to the aforesaid property of complicated structure, the
biosynthetic  process  of  native  lignin  has  been  studied  for  more
than a century, which is briefly described as follows: first, three
types  of  aromatic  alcohol  precursors,  which  are  sinapyl  alcohol,
coniferyl alcohol, and p -coumaryl alcohol, respectively, are biosyn-
thesized  from  L -phenylalanine  via  catalysis  of  several  enzymes
[44,47] .  These  three  precursors  are  then  transported  to  the  cell
wall with the help of glucosides [48] . Later, lignin is polymerized
on  the  cell  wall  through  the  enzyme-mediated  dehydrogenative
polymerization (namely lignification) of precursors by laccases and
peroxidases  [47] .  Three  types  of  corresponding  monolignols  are
finally formed from abovementioned aromatic alcohol precursors.
Since the biosynthesis of lignin is a synergistic effect with several
enzyme-catalyzed  reactions,  no  artificial  approach  is  applied  to
synthesize native lignin up  to  now  [49] .  Exploring  the complete
synthesis  mechanism  of  native  lignin  is  still  necessary  to  better
understand lignin structure and realize comprehensive applications
of lignocellulosic biomass.

2.2. Fundamental structures of lignin

Lignin  structure  analysis  is  complicated  compared  with  other
polymers  due  to  its  random  chemical  bonding  between  various
monolignols [50–52] . Monolignol types, linkages between mono-
lignols and functional groups in lignin will be introduced in detail.

2.2.1. Monolignols

The  chemical  structures  of  three  monolignols,  which  are  sy-
ringyl  (S  unit),  guaiacyl  (G  unit)  and  p -hydroxyphenyl  (H  unit),
respectively, are shown in Fig. 2 [50–52] . The differences among
them  depend  on  the  methoxylation  degree  on  the  benzene  ring
[51] .  Softwood  lignin  is  mainly  made  up  of  G  units  with  a  per-
centage  of  90–95 wt.%  of  the  total  monolignols,  while  hardwood
lignin includes both G and S units [37,41] . In grass lignin, all three
monolignol types can be observed [53] . The amounts of monolig-
nols in softwood and grass will be greatly different according to
plant species. Besides, the amounts and types of monolignols will
be affected by various pretreatments so that the ratio of S, G and
H units is an important index to analyze lignin properties during
the lignin isolation process.

2.2.2. Linkages between monolignols

During  the  lignification  process,  monolignols  are  connected
randomly  by  ether  bonds  or  carbon-carbon  bonds  at  different
locations,  which  generate  several  types  of  interunit  linkages  in
various  lignin  substructures  ( Fig.  2 ).  β-O-4 (cid:3)  ether  linkage  is  the
most dominant linkage type in lignin, which accounts for 50% of
the whole interunit linkages [38] . Meanwhile, the β-O-4 (cid:3)  linkage
is the most reactive linkage type during the depolymerization pro-
cess, and β-O-4 (cid:3) cleavage is a significant feature during the lignin
fragmentation. Therefore, the content variation of β-O-4 (cid:3) linkage is
a key criterion in most of lignin degradation studies [54] . Besides,
β- β(cid:3) ,  β-5 (cid:3) ,  β-1 (cid:3)  and  5-5 (cid:3)  linkages  also  exit  in  lignin,  but  they
are not as uppermost as β-O-4 (cid:3) linkage. β- β(cid:3) linkage is abundant
in  syringyl-rich  lignin  probably  due  to  the  higher  stability  and
longer  lifetime  of  the  sinapyl  alcohol  radicals  [55] .  β-5 (cid:3)  exists
in  phenylcoumaran  substructure,  which  can  be  obtained  from

dehydrogenation  polymerization  of  coniferyl  alcohol.  In  recent
studies, evidence has shown that rearrangement reaction happens
to form β-5 (cid:3) linkages after steam-explosion pretreatment [56,57] .
5-5 (cid:3) linkage comes from a biphenyl structure and is confirmed as
a native linkage type in the milled wood lignin, reported by Pew
et  al.  [58] .  β-1 (cid:3)  linkage,  mostly  in  spirodienone  substructure,  is
unstable in acidic conditions [59] .

2.2.3. Functional groups

Lignin has abundant functional groups, such as hydroxyl, ben-
zyl,  methoxyl,  ether,  carboxyl,  etc.,  resulting  in  its  amphiphilic
nature  [60] .  Hydroxyl  is  the  most  important  functional  groups
for  lignin  modifications  including  alkylation,  esterification,  phe-
nolation,  hydoxypropylation,  etc.  [37,50] .  There  are  two  types  of
hydroxyl  groups  which  are  aliphatic  hydroxyl  and  phenolic  hy-
droxyl, respectively. Hydroxyl content is a critical parameter to not
only estimate the etherification degree and condensation degree of
lignin but also influence the solubility of lignin [61] . In recent stud-
ies, 31 P NMR has been considered as a powerful method to char-
acterize the quantification of different hydroxyl types [50] . Benzyl
and methoxyl are two kinds of primary functional groups which
constitute the basic structure of monolignol, distinguishing lignin
from other main components in biomass. As mentioned above, the
monolignol type depends on the methoxyl substitution degree on
the aromatic ring. The methoxyl group in lignin is very stable un-
less severe depolymerization happens. For example, demethoxyla-
tion of lignin usually occurs at a high temperature (over 250 °C)
and  high  pressure  (over  5 MPa)  [62] .  Ether  bonds  are  common
bond types connected between monolignols, which mainly form β-
O-4 (cid:3) and α-O-4 (cid:3) linkages. In native lignin, carboxyl is believed to
be present in low concentration which increases significantly after
chemical modification in degradation processes [63] . The diversity
of functional groups shows great potential for lignin modification,
which prompt lignin applications in multiple areas such as mate-
rial synthesis and chemical catalysis, etc.

2.3. Preparation of lignin

As  summarized  in  Fig.  3 ,  based  on  production  scales,  lignin
preparation methods are classified into three sides: (i) laboratory
process,  (ii)  pulping  process,  and  (iii)  biorefinery.  Discussion  in
this  section  focuses  on  lignin  properties  resulted  from  various
lignin isolation procedures.

2.3.1. Lignin preparation in laboratory process

In  laboratories,  lignin  is  mostly  extracted  for  structural  char-
acterization research, and hence most methods are attempted to
maintain structures that are close to those of native lignin with
minimum destruction [46] .

Milled wood lignin (MWL) was first prepared in 1957 by treat-
ing milled biomass stock under reflux reaction using a mixture of
water and neutral solvent like dioxane through extraction system
[64] . This method gives an advantage of relatively complete lignin
structure, which has been considered as a representative of native
lignin for decades [65,66] . However, the lignin yield of the MWL
method  is  less  than  40 wt.%  of  the  entire  lignin  content  and  is
generally limited by milling time for dozens of hours [46,67,68] .
Additionally, MWL reserves certain amounts of carbohydrates due
to  the  unbreakable  lignin-carbohydrate  complex  (LCC)  between
lignin and carbohydrates (mainly hemicellulose) [69,70] .

Cellulolytic  enzyme  lignin  (CEL)  has  been  developed  subse-
quently by using cellulase to hydrolyze cellulose in biomass based
on the procedure of MWL [64] . Compared with MWL, CEL has a
higher lignin yield which is attributed to the removal of cellulose
while  keeping  an  analogous  structure  and  element  constitution
[71–74] .  For  the  viewpoint  of  Niu  et  al.,  the  structures  of  lignin
derived from CEL are close to those of natural lignin, which makes
CEL suitable for green applications such as carbon dot preparation
for  cellular  imaging  [72] .  Additionally,  lignin-based  nanoparti-
cle  preparation  from  CEL  was  reported  by  Tian  et  al.,  which
demonstrated  that  CEL  with  condensed  structure  after  steam
pretreatment performed great potential for the core formation of
lignin  nanoparticles  by  increasing  the  hydrophobic  aggregation

[73] . Moreover, the well-preserved structure and better yield make
CEL competent for lignin structural characterization [75,76] .

Enzymatic mild acidolysis lignin (EMAL) is an improved lignin
product  which  can  be  optimized  based  on  CEL  procedure  by
adding a low concentration of hydrochloric acid to achieve lignin
yield  up  to  70 wt.%  with  a  lignin  purity  around  90%  in  woody
plants, reported by Wu et al. [77] . Compared with MWL and CEL,
EMAL  has  fewer  LCCs  and  higher  molecular  weight,  which  indi-
cates a unique extraction protocol of lignin fractions [78] . Recently,
EMAL is utilized in structural analysis of various plants and is no
longer limited to woody species. With concomitant advantages of
high yield, high purity, and complete structure, EMAL is popular
for lignin structural analysis with diverse treatments. For example,
both Sun et al. [79] and Sathitsuksanoh et al. [80] reported EMAL
characterization  after  ionic  liquid  pretreatment.  Several  other
studies  utilized  EMAL  to  analyze  lignin  change  during  steam
explosion pretreatment [56,59] . Meanwhile, EMAL can be applied
to  accelerate  pyrolysis  processes  to  form  chars  and  tars  under
higher temperatures (from 600 to 900 °C) [81–83] .

2.3.2. Lignin preparation in pulping processes

Distinctive  from  lignin  isolation  in  a  laboratory  scale,  the
extracted lignin product in industrial scale is termed as technical
lignin,  which  was  first  realized  by  the  pulping  process  [84–86] .
Primarily, four different types of lignin are classified according to
various pulping processes, namely kraft lignin, lignosulfonate, soda
lignin, and organosolv lignin.

Most  of  the  lignin  in  the  pulping  industry  is  extracted  from
kraft  pulping  [35] .  Basically,  alkaline  solution  system  (such  as
sodium  sulfide  and  sodium  hydroxide  solution,  etc.)  is  used  in
this process, and lignin depolymerization mainly occurs in ether
linkages connected to α or β position of monolignols [44] . Lignin
polymers  are  broken  into  small  chains  by  ether  breakage  and
dissolved in the alkaline solution to form a lignin solution system
named black liquor [35] . Kraft lignin is then recovered by acidi-
fication of black liquor, which creates advantages of regeneration
and reutilization of Na + and S 2 − in the solution mixture [87] . Hy-
drophobic thiol groups are included in kraft lignin, which makes
the sulfur content of 1–2 wt.% [36] . However, most of kraft lignin
is  sulfur-free,  which can  be  precipitated in  an  acidic  solution  to
isolate lignin [44] .

Sulfite  pulping  process  utilizes  a  similar  process  to  kraft
pulping  but  with  acidic  solution  mediums  [51] .  The  final  lignin
products  are  called  lignosulfonates  because  of  massive  sulfonate
group formation onto the side chains. Lignosulfonates are soluble
in  water  with  hemicellulose,  so  external  technique  should  be
applied  to  remove  hemicellulose  component  [44] .  In  addition,
lignosulfonates  have  both  high  molecular  weight  and  high  ash
content  [35] .  All  these  features  make  lignosulfonates  qualified
for  many  industrial  applications,  such  as  newspaper  production,
adhesives, batteries, dispersants and surfactants [88,89] .

Soda lignin is isolated from soda or soda anthraquinone pulp-
ing process [38] . This method has been performed for non-woody
species since the 19th century [85] . As a catalyst, anthraquinone is
also used to weaken the degradation of carbohydrates and dissolve
lignin  simultaneously  [54] .  Although  soda  lignin  exhibits  very
high purity, its molecular weight is low [44] . Compared with kraft
pulping, soda lignin has no sulfur and is more like native lignin
than  kraft  lignin  and  lignosulfonate,  which  demonstrates  soda
lignin  as  a  good  candidate  for  chemical  modification  [36,90] .  So
far, soda lignin has been modified by a large range of reagents or
polymers, such as polyurethane [91] , hexamethylene diisocyanate
[92] , and ionic liquid [93] , etc.

By  using  organic  solvents  such  as  acetic  acid,  formic  acid,
ethanol, etc., the approach of organosolv pulping fabricates organo-
solv lignin with distinctive properties compared to the above three

lignin types. The most prominent distinction of organosolv lignin
is its excellent solubility. They can be dissolved in alkaline solu-
tions and a wide range of organic solvents [51] . Organocell lignin
and Alcell lignin are two familiar organosolv lignin types for com-
mercial production [94] . Organosolv lignin has a relatively uniform
molecular distribution mainly due to the dissolution effect of sol-
vents, but it contains several condensed structures [35,86] . Lately,
organosolv  lignin  is  attractive  to  biomaterial  synthesis  because
of  its  high  purity,  sulfur-free,  and  less  modification,  reported  by
Asawaworarit et al. [95] and Spiridon et al. [96] .

2.3.3. Lignin preparation in biorefinery

In  recent  years,  biorefinery  has  become  a  new  concept  for
biomass  conversion  to  useful  chemicals  and  fuels,  thus  realizing
part of the replacement of fossil energy and resource [39] . In the
biorefinery process with different biomass, three main components
(cellulose,  hemicellulose,  and  lignin)  are  expected  to  be  isolated
respectively  to  accomplish  complete  utilization.  Biomass  pre-
treatment is the core of biorefinery, which is aiming at reducing
biomass  recalcitrance,  improving  enzyme  digestion,  and  down-
stream product isolation [97] . Due to its irregular structure, lignin
is  commonly  treated  as  a  byproduct  in  a  biorefinery.  Nowadays,
with  improving  understandings  and  ever-growing  applications
of  lignin,  lignin  recovery  concepts,  even  lignin-first  biomass
fractionation strategies, have been gradually developed [98,99] .

It  is  common  that  biomass  pretreatment  technologies  can  be
classified into biological, physical, chemical, and physicochemical
approaches [100] , while it is hard to extract lignin by using either
biological  or  physical  pretreatment  alone.  Here,  the  discussion
aims at lignin extraction by using chemical and physicochemical
pretreatments, as well as combined pretreatments.

In  terms  of  chemical  pretreatment,  the  difference  of  lignin
deconstruction mechanism between alkali pretreatment and acid
pretreatment is apparent. Alkali-based pretreatment utilizes vari-
ous kinds of alkaline (e.g., NaOH, Ca(OH)
2 , ammonia, etc.), causing
effects  of  lignin  solubilization  or  degradation  [39] .  NaOH  is  the
most frequently used chemical for aqueous alkaline pretreatment.
It  is  similar  to  the  soda  pulping  process,  while  the  severity  is
relatively  low.  During  alkali-based  pretreatment,  the  ether  link-
ages  between  monolignols  are  partially  broken  to  obtain  lignin
oligomers, phenolic dimers, and monomers [39] . The degradation
degree of lignin highly depends on the biomass type and pretreat-
ment  conditions.  Another  popular  alkaline  reagent  is  ammonia,
which is combined with several biomass pretreatments like am-
monia  fiber  explosion  (AFEX),  anhydrous  ammonia  pretreatment
(AAP) and ammonia recycled percolation (ARP). Ammonia is good
to  preserve  carbohydrates  while  dissolving/reorganizing  lignin,
which is different from NaOH. It should be noted that ammonia is
easy to recover because of its high volatility [40] . β-O-4 (cid:3) linkages
are  rather  well  preserved,  and  minor  lignin  degradation  occurs
after  all  these  ammonia-induced  pretreatments.  Previous  studies
showed that lignin yields ranged from 31 wt.% to 65 wt.% of overall
lignin  content  by  these  ammonia-induced  pretreatments  with
1–2 wt.% nitrogen in these lignin products [101–103] .

On the other hand, diluted hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and
phosphoric  acid  are  often  applied  in  acid-based  pretreatments.
This  kind  of  pretreatment  can  be  divided  into  two  modes:  one
is  dilute  acid  solution  (0–5 wt.%)  at  relatively  high  temperatures
( > 180  °C),  the  other  is  concentrated  acids  at  low  temperatures
( < 120  °C).  In  most  cases,  dilute  acid  hydrolysis  depolymerizes
cellulose  and  hemicellulose  prior  to  lignin  extraction.  Lignin
transformation during acid hydrolysis has been concluded to three
parts:  lignin  droplet  formation  and  redeposit,  lignin  migrating,
and  pseudo-lignin  formation  [39] .  Moreover,  highly  concentrated
acid  can  be  used  for  acid  hydrolysis  like  Klason  lignin,  which
is  generally  applied  to  quantify  lignin  content  in  biomass  [37] .

However, Klason lignin is highly condensed so that it is difficult
for chemical modification.

Besides alkali and acid pretreatments, organosolv pretreatment
is  also  an  important  technique  for  lignin  extraction  with  two
aspects. On the one hand, organic solvents (e.g., alcohols, ethers,
esters,  ketones,  etc.)  have  excellent  solubility  to  dissolve  lignin
with  slight  chemical  modification.  Thus,  lignin  products  with
lower ash content, lower molecular weight, and higher hydropho-
bic property can be achieved [39,104] . On the other hand, highly
reductive agents (e.g., H
2 -donating solvents, etc.) or oxidants (e.g.,
O
2 , etc.) can be utilized in the organosolv pretreatment,
which  significantly  promotes  cleavage  of  ether  linkages  and  LCC
bonds,  resulting  in  different  lignin  structures  from  native  lignin.
The isolated lignin products also vary with different treating con-
ditions [39,40] . Therefore, organosolv lignin has been considered
as  an  excellent  candidate  for  composite  synthesis  because  of  its
high quality and excellent reactivity [104] .

Ionic liquid (IL) pretreatment is an emerging technique since it
was reported in 2007 [37] . The main advantages of IL include high
thermal  stability,  slight  vapor  pressure,  low  flammability,  and  a
broad liquidus temperature range [104] . Typical ionic liquids show
specific solubility to cellulose and lignin, which can be tuned by
changing viscosity with water or other solvents [105] . Two kinds
of  primary  lignin  extraction  pathway  have  been  proposed.  One
is  complete  biomass  dissolution  in  ILs  with  subsequent  lignin
precipitation by adding antisolvents; the other is a selective dis-
solution by specialized ILs for one of the components in biomass
and concomitant isolation steps [37] . However, the toxic property,
high reagent cost, and recyclability issue are intractable problems
which limit the practical applications of ILs. Recently, deep eutectic
solvent pretreatment regarded as a new class of ILs has become
effective to isolate lignin with high purity [106–108] . The results
showed that this pretreatment could dissolve lignin at about 60 °C
and realized extracted lignin with a purity of over 90% [108] .

Physicochemical  pretreatment  is  popular  in  biorefinery  plants
attributed to combined strengths with physical pretreatment and
chemical  pretreatment.  However,  lignin  extraction  by  physico-
chemical pretreatment has not been fully investigated. Up to date,
aside from the abovementioned AFEX pretreatment, lignin extrac-
tion  research  during  the  steam  explosion  pretreatment  and  hot
water  pretreatment  are  frequently  proposed.  These  two  types  of
pretreatments  are  also  called  autohydrolysis,  which  is  a  typical
kind of acid hydrolysis since water can be treated as an acid at
high temperatures [109] . Hot water pretreatment utilizes vapor at
high temperatures of 160–240 °C and high pressures for hemicellu-
lose hydrolysis [110] . Steam explosion pretreatment, which is also
operated  under  high  temperatures  and  pressurized  steam/water,
mostly  break  cellulose  or  hemicellulose.  During  these  two  pre-
treatments,  part  of  lignin  is  dissolved  in  hydrolysates,  and  the
rest  of  lignin  remains  in  the  pretreated  residues.  Acid-catalyzed
hydrolysis and acid-catalyzed condensation occur on lignin, which
causes the loss of β-O-4 (cid:3) linkages and the formation of condensed
structures [40] .

In order to increase production yield and efficiency to a higher
level,  combined  pretreatments  have  been  applied  in  biorefinery
frequently.  Lignin  isolation  during  combined  pretreatments  has
been  reviewed  by  Wang  et  al.  [39] .  Physical  pretreatment  is
indispensable to treat biomass material into suitable sizes, while
biological  pretreatment  (especially  enzymatic  hydrolysis)  is  an
effective pretreatment to improve hydrolysis yield. These two pre-
treatments are always cooperated in chemical and physicochemical
pretreatments.  Besides,  physicochemical  pretreatment  can  com-
bine  with  chemical  pretreatment.  There  is  no  doubt  that  lignin
extraction in biorefinery is a comprehensive task since a balance
should  be  kept  between  lignin  extraction  and  produced  chemi-
cals/fuels  from  cellulose  and  hemicellulose.  Moreover,  combined

pretreatments  are  also  adopted  during  the  biorefinery  process,
making  lignin  characterization  and  extraction  more  complicated.
Further studies on lignin isolation using different biorefinery pro-
cesses are still necessary to realize the full utilization of biomass.

2.4. Advantages of lignin

Due  to  the  origin  of  a  wide  range  of  plant  resources  and
industrial processes, lignin has with the features of huge reserves,
low cost and favorable renewability, as summarized in Fig. 4 [39] .
These are the most important prerequisites to broaden lignin ap-
plications for substituting other materials. In fact, lignin has been
researched in material science for quite a long time, not merely
because  of  the  abovementioned  features,  but  also  some  unique
properties like antioxidant ability, UV absorbance, biocompatibility,
antibacterial property, and autofluorescence [36,45] . These proper-
ties endow composite polymers with different functional features,
combining  material  science  with  other  disciplines  such  as  bio-
chemistry [52] , medical treatment [38] , artificial intelligence [36] ,
etc. Moreover, lignin depolymerization to high-value chemicals has
attracted lots of attention recently [40,64] ,

In the past few years, lignin application for energy storage de-
vices has developed immensely [51] . As an important component
in  the  preparation  of  rechargeable  batteries  and  supercapacitors,
lignin  and  lignin-derived  materials  have  numerous  strengths.
With  an  increased  output  in  commercial  manufacturing,  lignin
is globally available with low-cost, which effectively induces the
production  costs  of  the  devices  [111,112] .  It  is  noteworthy  that
the  major  element  in  lignin  is  Carbon,  with  a  high  content  of
above  60 wt.%  [113] .  Around  30 wt.%  of  the  organic  carbon  in
the  biosphere  is  originated  from  lignin  which  presents  massive
potential  applications  of  lignin  as  a  promising  carbon  precursor
[44,114] . Functional groups (especially benzyl and phenolic groups)
in lignin provide active reaction sites, enabling the storage of ions
for supercapacitors. In specific conditions, lignin can be transferred
to quinone moieties and presents great redox activity [115,116] .

It  is  obvious  that  different  lignin  types  have  different  func-
tionalities to be applied in energy storage systems. For example,
lignosulfonate  has  a  large  amount  of  sulfur  content,  which  can
be  treated  as  a  sulfur-doped  agent  in  rechargeable  batteries  or
supercapacitors  [117–122] .  Compared  with  lignosulfonate,  alkali

lignin  and  organosolv  lignin  are  good  for  electrospinning  which
has been demonstrated as an excellent method to prepare nano-
materials. In addition, lignin is an environmental-friendly polymer
which is distinctive from traditional additives. Excellent renewable
and biodegradable characteristics of lignin can help solve pollution
issues existed in the manufacturing of energy storage devices, es-
pecially in the fields of rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors.

3. Applications in rechargeable batteries

To  combat  global  warming  and  climate  change,  low  carbon
economy  has  been  raised  with  worldwide  awareness  [123,124] .
Over  the  years,  clean  and  renewable  energy  storage  systems
have  been  rapidly  developed  to  replace  traditional  fossil  fuels
[125,126] . Among them, rechargeable batteries are regarded as the
most important energy storage devices owing to the high energy
density, high output voltage, and long cycle life [126] . To meet the
ever-growing demands in large-scale applications such as electric
vehicles and stationary energy storage grids, tremendous research
efforts  have  been  devoted  to  investigating  the  electrochemical
performance  of  each  component  in  rechargeable  batteries  (i.e.,
anodes, electrolytes, binders, cathode additives, etc.) [127] . Addi-
tionally, the cost and processing method are also critical for the
commercial  implementation  [128,129] .  Herein,  we  provide  a  de-
tailed review of various applications of lignin as a renewable and
low-cost bioresource in recent rechargeable battery technologies,
especially  as  novel  anode  materials  and  promising  additives  in
lithium/sodium-ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs).

3.1. Lignin in lithium batteries

3.1.1. Anodes for lithium batteries

Carbon materials have been extensively studied as anode ma-
terials  for  LIBs due  to  their abundance,  low cost,  good  chemical
stability, and Li + storage ability [130,131] . Biomass-derived carbon
materials have received extensive attention due to their sustain-
ability and extremely low-cost [132–134] . Lignin, the second most
abundant polymer in nature, is a promising renewable carbon pre-
cursor since the large polyaromatic macromolecules of lignin re-
sults in a high char yield (over 50 wt.%) after pyrolysis [135,136] .
Additionally,  the  high  conductivity  and  excellent  mechanical  in-
tegrity of lignin-derived carbon are beneficial for high reversible
Li + storage capacity and fast lithium storage kinetics [137] . Table 1

summarizes  recent  work  on  various  lignin-derived  anodes  in
lithium batteries, including synthesis methods, carbonization con-
ditions, and the corresponding electrochemical performance.

Zhang et al. first introduced a lignin-based hierarchical porous
carbon  (LHPC)  anode  by  facile  preparation  with  alkali  lignin
precursor [138] . A 3D macroporous carbon network ( Fig. 5 a) was
obtained by using KOH as a template and activating agent. With
abundant  mesopores  and  micropores  decorated  on  carbon  walls,
LHPC had a high specific surface area of 907 m 2 g −1 , which effec-
tively enhanced the storage capacity and shortened the diffusion
distance  of  lithium  ions.  Consequently,  a  much  higher  capacity
of 470 mAh g −1  was achieved for the cell with the LHPC anode
compared  to  that  of  pristine  carbonized  lignin  anode  (180  mAh
g −1 ) after 400 cycles at a current density of 200 mAh g −1 .

Later, Xi et al. studied the performance of lignin-based porous
carbon  materials  with  different  activation  processes  [139] .  It  is
found  that  K
3  is  superior  to  KOH  in  promoting  the  rear-
rangement  of  lignin  carbon  atoms  and  increasing  the  degree  of
3  activated  lignin  carbon  (ALC-
graphitization.  In  addition,  K
K
3 ) had a higher porosity and continuous pore size distribution
from micro- to mesopores, leading to a high specific surface area of
2300 m 2 g −1 . The cells with ALC-K
3 anodes could maintain re-
versible capacities of 520 and 260 mAh g −1 after 200 cycles at cur-
rent densities of 200 and 10 0 0 mA g -1 , respectively. It is, therefore,
demonstrated  that  the  multistage  pore  structures  and  graphitic
structure  of  lignin-based  carbon  are  favorable  for  the  intercala-
tion  of  lithium  ions  because  of  the  fast  diffusion  of  ions  in  the
materials. Chang et al. investigated the influence of reduction en-
vironment on lignin-based hard carbon performance in LIBs [140] .
As illustrated in Fig. 5 b, surface defects were created along with
the polymerization of lignin monomers during the carbonization.
Carbonization  under  N
2  flow  leads  to  the  formation  of  dangling
bonds and oxygen-containing covalent bonds, which result in the
irreversible capacities due to the active reaction with lithium ions.
2 reduction process benefits from removing
the surface defects containing O atoms and improving the degree
of  graphitization  through  the  inductive  effect  of  H
2 .  Therefore,
the  cell  with  H-reduced  lignin  carbon  displayed  a  lower  initial
irreversible capacity and higher Coulombic efficiency (62.4%). The
excellent capacity retention of 92.3% was achieved after 200 cycles
at  2  C.  Wang  et  al.  fabricated  the  nitrogen  and  sulfur  co-doped
lignin-based carbon (NS-SFC) using sisal fibers via facile hydrother-
mal  process  followed  by  pyrolyzing  with  sulfamic  acid  [141] .  By

tuning  the  mass  ratio  of  sisal  fibers  to  sulfamic  acid  during
hydrothermal  treatment,  optimum  nitrogen  (4.5 wt.%)  and  sulfur
(0.9 wt.%) doping ratios were determined. High reversible capacity
(525  mAh  g -1 )  and  excellent  cycling  stability  could  be  obtained
for the cell with the prepared NS-SFC anode, which is attributed
to the improved electrical conductivity with nitrogen doping and
increased interlayer distance and micropores with sulfur doping.

Carbon  nanofibers  (CNF)  are  considered  to  have  higher  rate-
capability because the 1D morphology provides extremely higher
surface  area  and  enhanced  electrical  conductivity.  Lignin-based
carbon  nanofibers  (L-CNFs)  have  also  been  studied.  Due  to  its
low  molecular  weight,  lignin  is  usually  blended  with  other
polymers  to  prepare  fiber  materials  [142–144] .  Choi  first  fabri-
cated  the  PAN/lignin  CNFs  through  electrospinning  followed  by
heat-treatments  [142] .  It  is  found  that  the  carbon  structure  and
electrochemical performance of PAN/lignin CNFs were similar with
changing the lignin content from 0 to 50 wt.%. All PAN/lignin CNF
anodes  showed  stable  capacity  retention  ( ∼99%,  150  mAh  g -1 )
after 50 cycles at a high current density of 8.5 C, confirming the
PAN/lignin (1:1 by weight) CNFs are identical to pure PAN CNFs.
It is, therefore, demonstrated that lignin is a promising precursor
for  low-cost  production  of  carbon  nanofibers  for  high-rate  LIBs.
Similarly, PVA/lignin (1:1 by weight) porous CNFs were prepared
by  Stojanovska  et  al.  using  the  electrospinning  method  followed
by  an  activation  process  with  KOH  [143] .  After  10 0 0  cycles  at
a  current  density  of  300  mAh  g -1 ,  the  cell  could  still  deliver  a
specific  capacity  of  110  mAh  g -1  with  the  capacity  fade  of  16%.
Furthermore,  Wang  et  al.  introduced  the  fused  carbon  fibrous
mats  using  electrospun  poly(ethylene  oxide)/lignin  (PEO/lignin)
nanofibers followed by carbonization and thermal annealing with
urea  [144] .  To  further  reduce  the  cost  and  enable  the  ability  in
large-scale  production,  low  content  of  PEO  (10 wt.%)  was  uti-
lized for increasing the viscosity and spinnability of the solution.
After  thermal  annealing  with  urea,  free-standing  fused  carbon
fibrous mats were obtained. A retained capacity of 445 mAh g -1
was  delivered  after  50  cycles  at  a  current  density  of  50  mAh
g -1 ,  which  is  comparable  to  that  of  PAN-derived  carbon  fibers.
In  addition,  N-doped  fused  PEO/lignin  CNFs  exhibited  further
improved  electrical  conductivity  and  specific  capacity  (550  mAh

g -1 )  [144] .  Furthermore,  large-scale  lignin  carbon  fibers  derived
by melt-blowing and LignoBoost industrial Kraft production were
then investigated by Tenhaeff et al. and Nowak et al. [145,146] . A
satisfactory  capacity  of  350  mAh  g -1  was  achieved  at  the  initial
cycles for those large-scale lignin carbon fibers.

Although the carbon materials show good cycling stability and
excellent  rate  capability,  the  relatively  low  theoretical  capacity
(372 mAh g -1 ) prevents their further applications in high energy-
density LIBs. To improve upon the capacity, Li alloys, for example,
Li-Si  (theoretical  capacity  4200  mAh  g -1 ),  are  being  extensively
studied  [147–152] .  Nevertheless,  the  huge  volume  expansion
( ∼400%) and the formation of unstable solid electrolyte interface
(SEI)  on  the  Si  anode  during  lithiation  and  delithiation  lead  to
severe pulverization of Si particles and fast capacity fade [153,154] .
Structural  designs  based  on  carbon-Si  composites  can  poten-
tially  alleviate  or  avoid  the  pulverization  of  Si  particles.  Various
lignin-based composite anodes, including their synthesis methods,
carbonization  conditions,  and  electrochemical  performance,  are
summarized in Table 2 .

Niu et al. utilized biomass lignin to form a functional conformal
network  crosslinking  with  silicon  nanoparticles  (SiNPs)  via  self-
assembly in phytic acid [147] . SiNPs were first treated and func-
tionalized with phytic acid. The plentiful functional groups in pri-
mary  monolignol  precursors  endowed  abundant  action  sites  for
in-situ  modification  of  lignin  with  phytic  acid-treated  SiNPs.
Benefiting  from  the  excellent  mechanical  properties  of  cross-
linked  lignin,  the  novel  lignin/SiNP  composite  accommodated
large  volume  change  during  the  charge/discharge  process.  Dif-
ferent  mass  ratios  of  SiNPs  to  lignin  (SiNPs/lignin = 1:2,  2:1,
5:1)  were  investigated.  It  was  found  that  thin  functional  lignin
coating  (SiNPs/lignin = 5:1)  was  not  sufficient  for  stabilizing  the
Si  electrodes,  while  thick  conformal  lignin  network  coating
(SiNPs/lignin = 1:2) greatly influenced the total electrical conductiv-
ity of the anode, resulting in a lower specific capacity. The opti-
mum mass ratio was determined to be SiNPs/lignin = 2:1, and the
resultant cell exhibited remarkable cycling performance with 89%
capacity retention after 100 cycles at a current density of 300 mAh
g -1 ,  which  was  attributed  to  the  stable  SEI  layer  formed  on  the
lignin/SiNP anode. Pyrolyzed lignin/SiNP composites were also in-

vestigated by Chou et al. [148] . Carbon-coated Si structure (Si-Lig)
was obtained with lignin, while an interconnected carbon structure
with Si particles (Si-LigCel) was formed with lignocellulose precur-
sor. The cell with Si-LigCel anode showed better cycling stability
(capacity retention 83.4%) than that of the cell with Si-Lig anode
(38.5%). As illustrated in Fig. 6 a, the Si-Lig composite with carbon
coating enhanced the overall electrical conductivity and hence im-
proved the initial capacity. However, the repeatedly swelling and
shrinking of Si particles eventually destroyed the electrode struc-
ture, leading to the poor cycle life. In contrast, the Si-LigCel com-
posite  formed  an  interconnected  carbon  network,  and  Si  parti-
cles were embedded on this fibrous carbon structure, which could
accommodate significant volume changes during cycling. Chen et
al. added PEO (1 wt.%) in lignin/Si blend precursor, tuning the Si-
carbon in a core-shell structure with the void ( Fig. 6 b) [150] . Con-
sequently, the synthesized Si-lignin composite anode demonstrated
stable cycling (capacity retention 89.3%) over 100 cycles and high
rate capability up to 1.44 A g -1 . In addition, replacing Si with SiO x
could also improve the cycle life of Li-Si batteries by introducing
the buffer components of Li
4 generated during the first lithi-
ation process between SiO x  and Li. Carbon-coated SiO x  was pre-
pared by Chen et al. using a lignin-based precursor to improve the
electrical conductivity of SiO x [150] . With smaller volume changes
( ∼160%) in SiO x particles, the SiO x -Lignin composite anode exhib-
ited superior cycling stability. A retained capacity of 900 mAh g -1
could be still obtained after 250 cycles at a rate of 200 mAh g -1 ,
corresponding to a nearly 99% capacity retention. The results above
display that low-cost but high-performance electrodes can be pre-
pared via using those biomass derived materials which provide an
environmentally friendly approach for their practical applications.

3.1.2. Gel electrolytes for lithium batteries

The  usage  of  isolated  organic  liquid  electrolyte  in  LIBs  may
cause serious safety problems including leakage, flame, and blast
[155–157] .  Gel  polymer  electrolytes  (GPEs)  with  limited  liquid
electrolyte  uptake,  as  promising  alternatives,  greatly  reduce  the
safety  hazards  of  LIBs,  however,  the  current  polymers  used  in
GPEs are difficult for biodegradation, including polyethylene oxide
(PEO), polyacrylonitrile (PAN), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), and
polyvinyl acetate (PVA) [158–164] . Consequently, the massive use
of GPEs in commercial LIBs and the huge degradation resistance
of these polymer matrixes will eventually result in serious “white
pollution” in  a  natural  environment.  Therefore,  as  the  second
abundant  biopolymer  on  the  earth,  lignin  has  great  potential  as
the GPE matrix for replacing the synthetic polymers.

Gong  et  al.  first  explored  the  lignin-based  GPE  to  develop
truly green and environmental-friendly LIBs [165] . The membrane
shown in Fig. 7 a was obtained by simply drying the suspension
of lignin in distilled water. With high liquid electrolyte upholding
(230 wt.%)  properties,  the  lignin-based  GPE  demonstrated  an  ex-
cellent ionic conductivity of 3.73 mS cm −1  at room temperature.
More importantly, the lignin-based GPE was thermally stable up to
250 °C with a high lithium transference number of 0.85 owing to
the strong interactions between the massive phenol hydroxyl units
in lignin and anions in lithium salts [165] . Moreover, the lignin-
based GPE exhibited favorable compatibility with the lithium an-
ode and outstanding electrochemical stability up to 7.5 V. All these
remarkable properties endow lignin with application potential in
GPEs for LIBs. However, the mechanical property of the pure lignin
membrane is poor, which greatly limits the practical application of
many GPEs. To improve the mechanical properties, Liu et al. intro-
duced PVP/lignin composite membrane, which has enhanced me-
chanical rigidity in terms of Young’s modulus and better thermal
stability with a mass content of PVP (22 wt.%) [166] . As a powerful
viscidity macromolecule polymer, PVP is contributed to obtaining a
dense composite membrane with lignin under the incorporation of
γ -aminopropyltriethoxysilane (KH-550) to improve the compatibil-
ity ( Fig. 7 b). Consequently, the PVP/lignin composite GPE presented
a better mechanical strength and higher safety toward harsh de-
mands for high-performance LIBs with desired sustainability and
environmental protection.  In  addition,  the  Li-ion  cells  assembled
with PVP/lignin composite GPE demonstrated a good capacity re-
tention of 95.3% with a specific capacity of 135 mAh g -1 after 100
cycles at a current density of 0.2 C, which is superior to that of the
cell with commercial Celgard separators. Similarly, PVA/lignin com-
posite GPEs also showed improved mechanical properties [167] .

Xiong et al. further extended the lignin GPE in lithium hybrid
aqueous batteries by using an aqueous solution as the electrolyte
instead of commonly-used, highly flammable organic solvents. The
rechargeable  lithium  aqueous  batteries  (ReLABs)  are  believed  to
be  the  most  attractive  alternatives  for  highly  safe,  low-cost,  and
environmentally friendly energy storage systems [168] . In a typical
ReLAB,  fumed  silica-based  aqueous  gel  electrolyte  is  commonly
used  but  facing  severe  problem  on  the  corrosion  of  zinc  anode
due  to  the  existence  of  ionized  silanol  groups  (Si-O-)  on  the
surface of silica nanoparticles as a solid acid. In Xiong’s work, the
lignin molecules were grafted with cationic quaternary ammonium
groups to provide strong electrostatic interaction with fumed silica
( Fig. 7 c). Since some of the acidic groups (Si-O-) on the surface
of  fumed  silica  were covered  by  lignin molecules,  the  acidity  of
fumed silica was weakened, which fundamentally suppressed the

corrosion of zinc anode. With the optimum coating concentration
of  lignin  molecules  (5 wt.%),  the  cells  exhibited  excellent  cycling
stability for 10 0 0 cycles with 82% capacity retention at 4 C.

3.1.3. Binders for lithium batteries

Polymer binders are another important component in batteries.
Currently, the most frequently used binder, PVDF, is not biodegrad-
able.  This  fluorinated  polymer  can  easily  deteriorate  the  cycling
performance  of  the  batteries  due  to  the  formation  of  stable  LiF
and double bonds (C = CF-) after reacting with lithium metal [169] .
Therefore, lignin has been investigated as an alternative candidate
for a non-fluorinated and environmentally friendly binder.

Lu et al. explored the possibility of using lignin as the binder
material for both the cathode (LiFePO
4 ) and anode (graphite), and
demonstrated  relatively  high  specific  capacity  and  good  stability
[170] .  Reversible  capacities  of  148  and  305  mAh  g -1  could  be
delivered  at  0.1  C  for  the  lignin-binded  cathodes  and  anodes,
respectively.  Noted  that,  the  pretreatment  of  lignin  prior  to  the
slurry preparation is critical to obtain good battery performance,
which  removes  the  low-molecular-weight  lignin  molecules  that
can  be  dissolved  in  electrolytes.  Addition  to  the  benefit  of  sus-
tainability,  electrodes  with  the  lignin  binder  showed  improved
4 as cathode
compatibility in high-voltage LIBs using LiNi
materials [171] .

0.5 Mn

Generally,  carbonate-based  electrolytes  are  prone  to  oxidative
decomposition  when  the  cathode  voltage  exceeds  4.3 V,  which
generates alkyl free radicals and leads to polymerization of solvent
and  formation  of  cathode/electrolyte  interphase  (CES)  [172–177] .
Therefore, biomass-based lignin with predominant phenolic groups
could serve as a free radical scavenger to suppress the electrolyte
decomposition  and  extend  the  battery  lifespan  ( Fig.  8 a)  [171] .
Compared  to  the  cells  using  PVDF  binder  (capacity  retention
46.2%), the cell with the lignin-based binder exhibited significantly

higher capacity retention of 94.1% (110.8 mAh g -1 ) after 10 0 0 cy-
cles, and the overall Coulombic efficiency was maintained at 99.5%.
High performance and durable silicon composite anodes were
developed in which the conventional binder and conductive addi-
tives were replaced by lignin as well [177] . As shown in Fig. 8 b, Si
nanoparticles are uniformly coated with the heavily cross-linked
lignin  that  forming  a  3D  flexible  framework  surrounding  the  Si
nanoparticles.  After  studying  the  structural  and  electrochemical
performance  of  Si-lignin  composites  at  different  heat  treatment
temperatures  ( Fig.  8 c),  Si-lignin  composite  carbonized  at  600  °C
showed  the  balanced  properties  between  high  conductivity  and
retaining  polymer  flexibility,  leading  to  high  initial  discharge
capacity of 3086 mAh g -1 and retaining capacity of 2378 mAh g -1
after  100  cycles  at  a  current  density  of  1  A  g −1 .  In  conclusion,
the aforementioned advantages would rank lignin as a promising
binder  for  renewable  and  high-performance  LIBs,  which  can  not
only  enhance  batteries’  electrochemical  performance  but  also
reduce the manufacturing cost.

3.1.4. Cathode additives for lithium batteries

As  a  renewable  and  low-cost  material  with  abundant  ac-
tive  C = O  functional  groups,  lignin  has  been  studied  in  primary
(disposable)  lithium  batteries  as  cathode-active  materials  [51] .
Bioextracted  lignin  was  developed  in  low-cost  primary  lithium
batteries  since  the  heterogeneous  morphology  of  the  lignin
particles  greatly  facilitated  the  diffusion  of  Li +  [178–180] .  The
oxygen-containing  groups  were  directly  associated  with  the
specific  capacity  of  Li/lignin  cells,  where  the  carbonyl  groups
(C = O), hydroxly groups (-OH), and ether groups (C-O-C) in lignin
demonstrated  strong  electroactive  redox  properties  with  Li +
[178] .  A  maximum  capacity  of  600  mAh  g -1  could  be  obtained
in  practical  Li/lignin  cells.  In  addition,  owing  to  the  availability
of  plentiful  oxygen-containing  functional  groups  in  polymeric

backbones,  lignin  is  also  applied  as  a  preferred  precursor  for
the  fabrication  of  mesoporous  carbons  for  use  as  conductive
additives in cathode materials. For instance, encapsulating sulfur
into  conductive  carbon  materials  has  been  demonstrated  as  an
effective method to improve the cycling stability of Li-S batteries
by improving the electrical conductivity of sulfur and limiting the
diffusion of polysulfides during cycling. Yu et al. synthesized the
sulfur-carbon composite using lignin-derived macro-/micro-porous
carbon [181] . The high specific surface area of 1211.6 m 2 g −1 and
abundant  oxygen-containing  functional  groups  on  the  surface  of
lignin-derived  carbon  framework  functionalized  for  the  chemical
adsorption of polysulfides. Consequently, with the optimum sulfur
loading (50 wt.%), a high reversible discharge capacity of 1241 mAh
g -1  was delivered initially at a current density of 0.5 C, and the
capacity retention was 64% after 100 cycles.

3.2. Lignin in sodium batteries

SIBs have been considered as a promising alternative for LIBs
because of the potentially low-cost and abundant sodium resources
[182–184] .  However,  the  standard  anode  material  (graphite)  for
LIBs displays limited ability to store Na + owing to the larger ionic
size  of  Na +  (55%  larger  than  Li + )  [182] .  Therefore,  the  recent
development  of  SIBs  is  mainly  focused  on  finding  a  suitable
anode material to host Na +  [185] . It is recently found that hard
carbons with hierarchical pore structures and enlarged interlayer
lattice  distance  are  favored  for  Na + storage  and  transport,  and
biomass-derived  hard  carbon  materials  received  much  attention
due to the abundant pore structures and cost-efficiency [185–187] .

As  a  promising  biomass  precursor  for  hard  carbon,  lignin-based
carbon anodes have been extensively studied for SIBs, and Table 3
summarizes  the  work  on  various  lignin-based  carbon  anodes,
including the source of lignin materials, carbonization conditions,
and their electrochemical performance [143,188–198] .

As  shown  in  Table  3 ,  most  lignin-based  hard  carbon  anodes
derived  from  biomass  materials  (rice  rusk,  pitch,  oak  leaves,
peat moss, etc.) or industrial wastes (Kraft black liquor, etc.) could
deliver satisfactory capacities ( ∼300 mAh g -1 ) and exhibit good cy-
cling stability at low current densities. The unique pore structures
of these carbonized lignin-based biomaterials make them promis-
ing candidates for use as the anodes of SIBs. Nitrogen doping can
further  improve  the  cycling  performance  of  lignin-based  carbon
anodes.  Du  et  al.  introduced  the  N-doped  lignin  porous  carbon
2  nanoparticles (100 nm) in the precursor
structure by adding SiO
and etching after pyrolyzation in N
2 ( Fig. 9 a) [196] . The obtained
N-doped carbon materials showed a honeycomb-like morphology
with  uniform  nanopores,  resulting  in  a  high  rate  capability  due
to the low ion-diffusion resistance and the short distance of ionic
migration.  Consequently,  a  high  reversible  capacity  of  100  mAh
g -1  was  achieved  after  1100  cycles  at  a  high  current  density  of
1 A g -1 , and the corresponding capacity fade was only 8%.

Navarro-Suarez et al. investigated the temperature effect on the
synthesis  of  lignin-derived  carbon  anodes  for  SIBs  [197] .  As  can
be seen in Fig. 9 b, hard carbon with a large number of buried mi-
cropores was formed when carbonizing the lignin at above 700 °C,
while  further  increasing  the  carbonization  temperature  led  to  a
decrease  in  interlayer  distance.  At  a  low  temperature  of  400 °C,
the carbonization and activation process occurred simultaneously,

resulting in the increase of porosity distribution (from micro- to
mesopores) because of the natural gas evolution from the potas-
sium  precursor.  Alvin  et  al.  further  established  the  relationship
between the carbonization temperature and Na + storage capacity
of lignin-based anodes [195] . As summarized in Table 4 , the 1st
cycle  discharge  capacity  increased  from  333.52  to  392.27  mAh

L -10 0 0 to L -120 0 indicated the micropore filling mechanism was
not  the  dominant  in  Na + storage  for  lignin-based  anodes,  while
the enhanced storage capacity from L -10 0 0 to L -120 0 was mainly
attributed to the improvement of graphitization degree (decrease

in  I D /I G  ratio),  which  provided  more  active  sites  between  the
interlayer  spacing  of  the  graphitic  regions  for  Na +  intercalation.
However, because of the large radius of Na + , the further increment
of  carbonization  temperature  (L130 0-L150 0)  resulted  in  a  huge
decrease in Na + storage capacity due to the formation of desirable
graphite structure with a reduced interlayer spacing ( d 002 ). In addi-
tion, because of the severe collapse of micropores, the surface area
decreased  at  higher  carbonization  temperatures  (L130 0-L150 0),
which was also not favored in Na + intercalation. The reduction of
surface  area could  improve the initial Coulombic  efficiency  (ICE)
owing to the lower degree of SEI formation on the anode surface.
Therefore,  an  optimized  carbonization  temperature  is  critical  for
lignin-based  anode  to  achieve  high  Na +  storage  capacity  and
Coulombic efficiency. The graphitization degree and lattice spacing
are more important than the surface area for lignin-based anodes.
As  studied,  a  fine  structure  with  microporosity  demonstrated
better cycling performance for lignin-based carbon anodes in SIBs.
Alvin et al. investigated the Na + storage mechanism in hard carbon
in  light  of  the  physicochemical  properties  of  the  lignin-derived
hard  carbon  including  graphitization  degree,  interlayer  spacing,
micropore  size  distribution,  and  specific  surface  area  [195] .  By
carefully tuning the carbonization conditions of lignin-based hard
carbon  materials  and  using  various  electrochemical  analysis  and
ex-situ  experimental  techniques,  a  clear  mechanism  of  sodiation
process was presented with the relationship to carbon structures.
As illustrated in Fig. 9 c, Na ions are adsorbed on surface defects
and edge sites at the initial sodiation process (1–0.2 V), followed
with  micropore  filling  process  in  the  discharge  sloping  region
between  0.2  and  0.1 V.  Then,  Na +  ions  are  intercalated  into  the
graphitic layers in plateau region below 0.1 V. At the final cutoff
potential (0.05 V), Na + ions are further adsorbed and form clusters
in micropores due to relatively high concentration in micropores.
Therefore,  the  physicochemical  properties  of  hard  carbon  mate-
rials directly control the behavior of Na + storage. Similar to LIBs,
fiber-shaped  lignin-based  hard  carbon  materials  show  improved
rate-capabilities [198,199] . Electrospun PAN/lignin (1:1 by weight)
carbon  nanofibers  were  applied  in  SIBs  by  Jin  et  al.  [198] .  At  a
high  current  density  of  1  A  g −1 ,  the  cell  with  PAN/lignin anode
maintained a reversible capacity of 80 mAh g −1 .

4. Applications in supercapacitors

Supercapacitors,  also  known  as  electrochemical  capacitors  or
ultracapacitors, have been widely used in electric/hybrid vehicles
and other devices due to their high power density, long cycle life
( > 10 5 cycle) and broad working temperature range of −40 ∼80 °C
[200,201] .  The  storage  of  energy  for  supercapacitors  is  primarily
achieved  by  electrostatic  adsorption  of  ions  onto  the  electrode-
electrolyte interface or by a faradaic reaction of active materials
[202] .

Among various electrode materials for supercapacitors, porous
carbonaceous materials have received significant attention not only
because of their high surface areas but also due to their superior
electrical conductivity and high chemical stability [203,204] . Lignin
is an abundant aromatic polymer with a carbon content of about

60 wt.%,  which  has  been  considered  as  a  promising  candidate
for  preparing  porous  carbon  materials  [203,205] .  Moreover,  each
structural unit in lignin contains highly reactive hydroxyl groups
which  can  provide  pseudocapacitance  by  reversibly  conversion
between  hydroxyl  and  quinone,  as  shown  in  Fig.  10 .  Therefore,
lignin has been tremendously studied as the carbon precursor and
electrolyte additives for supercapacitors. Here we summarize the
research  and  application  progress  of  lignin-based  electrode  and
electrolyte materials for supercapacitors in recent years.

4.1. Electrode materials for supercapacitors

Structures  and  properties  of  lignin-based  carbon  electrodes
can  be  manipulated  by  tuning  preparation  processes  [206–209] .
Depending on the structures and processing methods, we classify
the  lignin-based  porous  carbons  into  three  categories,  which
are  activated  carbon,  templated  carbon,  and  composite  carbon,
respectively.  More  details  regarding  these  three  types  of  carbon
electrodes are presented in this section.

4.1.1. Activated carbon electrodes

Activated  carbon,  as  a  common  electrode  for  supercapacitors,
is generally fabricated by carbonizing carbon precursors followed
by  activation  processes.  Lignin-derived  activated  carbon  can  be
easily  prepared  by  carbonizing  and  activating  lignin  precursors
[210] .  During  the  carbonization  process,  lignin  is  transformed
into  lignin-based  char  by  pyrolysis  at  a  high  temperature.  Then,
lignin-based  char  is  passed  through  an  activation  process  to
form  porous  activated  carbon  materials.  In  general,  the  activa-
tion  process  of  lignin  is  usually  divided  into  physical  activation
and  chemical  activation.  Physical  activation  is  the  activation  of
2  or  steam.  While
lignin-based  char  at  high  temperatures  by  CO
chemical  activation  is  that  lignin-based  char  mix  with  chemical
activation  agents  (such  as  KOH,  ZnCl
3 ,  etc.)  followed  by
heating  the  mixture  under  an  inert  atmosphere  [211] .  It  should
be noted that both carbonization and activation processes would
influence the structures of activated carbon materials dramatically.
Zhao  et  al.  used  lignin-rich  black  liquor  as  a  carbon  precursor
and  KOH  as  an  activator  to  explore  the  effects  of  carbonization
temperature,  activation  temperature  and  activation  time  on  the
structures and properties of lignin-derived carbon electrodes [212] .
In their study, the carbonization temperature was set between 500

and 900 °C. More components of lignin were thermally degraded
with  the  increment  of  carbonization  temperature,  which  led  to
a  decline  in  the  yield.  Meanwhile,  the  specific  surface  area  of
the  carbon  electrode  also  decreased,  resulting  in  degradation
of  the  capacitance  of  the  prepared  electrodes.  The  increment  of
activation  temperature  and  extension  of  activation  time  would
enhance  the  specific  surface  area  of  the  lignin-based  activated
carbon.  However,  the  high  specific  surface  area  of  an  electrode
does not always lead to high specific capacitance. Moreover, they
found that the material with an average pore size of 1.92 nm could
have  the  highest  capacitance.  Excessive  activation  could  lead  to
too  many  sub-nano  pores,  which  are  unfavorable  for  electrolyte
ions to enter. Eventually, the electrode carbonized at 600 °C with
a  2 h  activation  at  the  same  temperature  possessed  the  highest
specific capacitance of 41.4 F g −1 at 10 mA g −1 .

Currently,  compared  with  physical  activation,  the  chemical
activation process is the main approach for preparation of lignin-
derived electrodes because the temperature for chemical activation
is low and a high carbon yield can be achieved [212] . The activator
is  a  critical  factor  which  significantly  affects  the  specific  surface
area  and  pore  structure  of  the  lignin  carbon  electrode  in  this
process.  Therefore,  it  is  important  to  select  a  suitable  process
condition  and  activator  for  fabricating  lignin-based  activated
carbon electrodes. Fang et al.  explored how the amount of KOH
activator would influence lignin-based electrodes [213] . Elevating
the  amount  of  KOH  would  increase  the  pore  volume  of  carbon
materials, but excessive KOH would cause the mergence of orig-
inal pores. The best performance of a carbon electrode could be
achieved with an optimum weight ratio (KOH/C) of 3. A specific
capacitance  of  267.8  F  g −1  at  50 mA  g −1  and  high  retention  of
83.3% even after 20 0 0 cycles could be obtained. In addition to the
amount of activator, the type of activator is also of concern. Gen-
erally, most activators have catalytic effects on dehydration of the
lignin matrix, which result in forming porous structures of lignin.
However, there are still differences in the activation mechanisms
of  various  activators,  which  contribute  to  different  structures
and  properties.  Wu  and  his  co-workers  selected  three  different
activators (ZnCl
3 ) to study the effect of activators on
lignin-based carbon materials [211] . The basic properties of carbon
electrodes activated by three different activators are summarized
in Table 5 . The specific surface area of lignin-based electrode acti-
vated by ZnCl

catalyzing dehydroxylation and dehydration during the activation

Since  lignin  exists  in  most  plants,  many  researchers  use
lignin-rich  plants  to  synthesize  activated  carbon  electrodes  for
supercapacitors.  The  structures  of  these  activated  carbon  ma-
terials  highly  depend  on  the  structure  and  composition  of  the
precursor  plants.  Recently,  Senthilkumar  et  al.  synthesized  the
activated carbon material from tamarind fruit shell using KOH as

the activator [214] . A high specific surface area of 1042.31 m 2 g −1
with a pore volume of 0.61 m 3 g −1 was achieved. They used this
2 SO
high-surface-area  electrode  with  PVA  (polyvinyl  alcohol)/H

gel  polymer  electrolyte  to  fabricate  a  solid-state  supercapacitor
which  had  no  leakage  and  corrosion  problems  and  possessed
better  cycling  stability.  The  obtained  cell  exhibited  high  specific
capacitance and energy density of 412 F g −1  and 9.166 Wh kg −1 ,
respectively,  at  a  current  density  of  1.56  A  g −1 .  When  sodium
molybdate (Na

density  of  the  supercapacitor  increased  dramatically,  reaching
648 F g −1 and 14.4 Wh kg −1 , respectively.

Due to the diversity of lignin-rich plants, the chemical compo-
sition of the electrode obtained by pyrolysis is also different. For
example,  alginic  acid,  which  is  a  fibrous  material  located  in  the
cell wall of seaweeds, has a large amount of oxygen after pyrolysis,
making it easier for the electrode to adsorb electrolyte ions [215] .
Pintor’s  group  utilized  turbinate  seaweeds  as  a  carbon  source
to  obtain  a  carbon  electrode  by  pyrolysis  at  800  °C  [216] .  The
electrode  with  some  oxygen-containing  functional  groups  had  a
specific surface area of 812 m 2 g −1 . The symmetric supercapacitor
with  the  electrode  could  deliver  a  specific  capacitance  of  74.5  F
g −1  in  1 M  tetraethylammonium  tetrafluoroborate  (TEABF
4 )  not
only due to the increase of active sites of the electrode but also
because  of  the  pseudocapacitance  contributed  by  those  oxygen-
containing  functional  groups.  Other  biomass  resources,  such  as
sisal fiber [217] , eucalyptus leaves [218] , cornstalk [219] , bamboo
[220] ,  coconut  leaves  [221]  and  mung  bean  husks  [222] ,  have
been performed as activated carbon electrodes for supercapacitors
as  well.  This  not  only  resolves  these  bio-wastes  effectively  but
also  provides  renewable,  inexpensive  precursors  for  commer-
cial  activated  carbon  electrodes,  further  enhancing  the  practical
applications of supercapacitors.

In hierarchical porous carbon electrodes, the macroporous core
provides high buffer volume for electrolyte ions, the mesoporous
channels are beneficial to the fast ion transportation, and micro-
pores can further enhance the ion-accessible surface area for the
construction  of  electric  double  layer,  which  helps  them  obtain
excellent  electrochemical  performance  [203] .  Lignin  has  a  loose
structure  which  is  good  for  forming  porous  structures  during
pyrolysis.  Therefore,  many  efforts  have  been  made  on  utilizing
lignin as a precursor to prepare hierarchical porous activated car-
bon electrodes by appropriate pyrolysis and activation processes.
Guo et al. reported a lignin-based 3D hierarchical porous carbon
prepared  via  carbonization  and  activation  processes  [223] .  As
shown in Fig. 11 a, lignin-derived carbon materials with abundant
interconnected  large  pores  were  prepared  by  hydrothermal  car-
bonization, and then 3D porous carbon could be achieved through
the subsequent KOH activation. The porous carbon electrode ex-
hibited a high specific surface area of 1660 m 2 g −1 , good electrical
conductivity  of  5.4  S  cm −1  and  multiple  pore  sizes  (shown  in
Fig. 11 b), which resulted in a high specific capacitance of 420 F
g −1  at  0.1  A  g −1 ,  good  rate  performance  (67%  retention  when
the current density increased from 0.1 A g −1  to 100 A g −1 ), and
excellent  cycle  stability  (99%  capacitance  retention  after  10,0 0 0
cycles at 5 A g −1 ) in 6 M KOH electrolyte. Symmetric supercapac-
itor assembled by using this carbon electrode had an outstanding
energy density of 46.8 Wh kg −1  which could maintain an energy
density of 22.9 Wh kg −1 at an ultrahigh power density of 25,400 W
kg −1 in ionic liquid systems.

In  the  preparation  of  hierarchical  porous  electrodes,  suitable
treatments  create  oxygen-containing  groups  which  could  fur-
ther  enhance  their  electrochemical  performance  as  discussed
previously.  Zhang  et  al.  reported  a  kind  of  hierarchical  porous
carbon  (LHPC)  with  12.27  at.%  oxygen-containing  groups  from
lignin  in  the  existence  of  KOH  [224] .  The  material  delivered  a

the solely carbonized lignin (LC, 25.7 F g −1 ) at 10 mV s −1  in 1 M

4 due to the high specific surface area and the pseudocapac-
itance provided by a redox reaction of oxygen-containing groups
(shown in Fig. 12 a). As can be seen in Fig. 12 b, this porous carbon
electrode  (LHPC)  had  excellent  rate  performance  (a  maintained
capacitance  of  123.5  F  g −1  at  10  A  g −1 )  and  cycling  stability
(capacitance  retention  of  97.3%  after  50 0 0  cycles).  Lignin-based
hierarchical  porous  carbon  electrodes  of  many  other  structures
including hollow spherical carbon and interconnected hierarchical
porous carbon are also reported [225,226] .

4.1.2. Templated carbon electrodes

The templating method has been considered as an effective ap-
proach for designing the pore size, porosity, and other structures of
carbon materials to enhance their electrochemical properties [227] .
A large amount of oxygen-containing functional groups in lignin
and the soft template can self-assemble into precursors through a
hydrogen bond interaction, and finally, form mesoporous materials
by  carbonization.  Moreover,  a  hard  template  can  also  be  well
dispersed in the lignin matrix. Therefore, lignin-derived templated

carbon electrodes can be simply obtained by uniformly filling tem-
plates into the lignin matrix followed by carbonizing and removing
the  templates  through  chemical  or  physical  approaches.  After
removing templates, templated electrodes exhibit uniform meso-
pores which can provide fast-moving channels for electrolyte ions,
endowing excellent rate performance for supercapacitors. Saha et
al. synthesized mesoporous carbon electrodes with a surface area
of 1148 m 2 g −1 and mesoporosity of nearly 66% from lignin by us-
ing Pluronic F127 as a pore-forming agent [228] . The synthesized
mesoporous carbon electrode activated by CO
2 exhibited a capac-
itance of 102.3 F g −1 and excellent rate performance in 6 M KOH.
Multiple templates have also been utilized by others to prepare
lignin  template  carbon  electrodes  since  the  hierarchical  porous
structure can be designed by selecting different templates, which
may realize both high energy density and fast ion transfer prop-
erties of obtained carbon materials. Li and co-workers synthesized
a large-scale hierarchical porous carbon monolith using lignin as a
carbon source via a dual-template approach, as shown in Fig. 13 a
[229] .  Briefly,  the  carbon  monolith  was  obtained  by  carbonizing
the mixture of P123, lignin and mesoporous silica (KIT-6) followed
by  removing  the  templates.  The  symmetric  supercapacitor  with

this carbon electrode had an outstanding areal capacity of 3.0 F
cm −2 and a volume capacity of 97.1 F cm −3 at a current density of
1.4 mA cm −2 even without using a binder and conductive additive.
In addition, the supercapacitor also achieved a high areal energy
density of 0.16 mWh cm −2 at 1.75 mW cm −2 and excellent cycling
performance of ∼95% retention after 10,0 0 0 cycles.

However, most of the templates are too costly to be operated
on  a  large  scale.  Therefore,  selecting  low-cost  and  convenient
materials  as  templates  is  extremely  important  to  minimize  the
total cost of the resultant supercapacitors. Liu et al. performed ice
crystals as a layered template for the synthesis of 2D lignin sheet
using freeze-drying liquid-nitrogen-quenched lignin dispersion, as
shown in Fig. 13 b [230] . The carbonized lignin sheet with a surface
area of 857.4 m 2  g −1  and a high electrical conductivity of 2.5 S
cm −1 could deliver a specific capacitance of 281 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 .
For  lignin,  some  templates  not  only  create  pores  but  play  other
roles (i.e., a catalyst for graphitization [220] , pH regulator and acti-
vator [231] , etc.). Zhang’s group reported lignin-based hierarchical
porous carbon microspheres (HPCM) by inverse phase dehydration
and further K
3 activation, which played three important roles
in  synthesizing  microporous  carbon  microspheres  [231] .  Firstly,
3 acted as a pH regulator to make lignin better dissolved in
K
water. Secondly, K
3 crystals became the hard template to form
3 , acting
uniform mesopores in the carbon spheres. Thirdly, K
as an activating agent, promoted the formation of a large number
of  micropores  with  a  size  around  4 nm  ( Fig.  14 a),  which  served
as  channels  for  connecting  mesopores  to  reduce  the  movement
distance  of  electrolyte  ions.  The  performance  of  the  electrode
3  to
(HPCM-0.75)  was  the  best  when  the  mass  ratio  of  K

lignin was 0.75. Due to the structure design of hierarchical porous
electrodes, the supercapacitor assembled by HPCM-0.75 achieved
a high capacitance of 140 F g −1  and retention of 70%, when the
current density increased from 0.05 A g −1 to 10 A g −1 , as shown in
Fig. 14 b. Even though large-scale applications of template carbons
are  limited  due  to  the  complexity  of  the  process  and  expensive
templates,  lignin-based  template  carbon  is  very  promising  for
preparation through selecting proper low-cost templates [227,232] .

4.1.3. Composite electrodes

Pure lignin-derived materials have been performed as electric
double  layer  electrodes,  whose  electrochemical  performance  is
mainly affected by their specific surface areas and pore structures.
Besides  that,  some  materials  with  pseudo-capacitive  properties
(such  as  metal  oxides,  heteroatoms,  etc.)  or  high-performance
carbon  materials  (such  as  graphene,  carbon  nanotubes,  etc.)
have  been  introduced  into  lignin-derived  electrodes  to  fabricate
composite electrodes with improved performance [233–237] .

Inspired from recent research [238] which demonstrated that
introducing nitrogen into activated carbon could induce additional
pseudo-capacitance via reversible redox reactions and improve the
wettability between the electrodes and electrolytes, Jurewicz et al.
employed a lignin-containing coconut shell as a carbon source and
melamine as a nitrogen source [239] . The prepared electrode could
have a high nitrogen content of up to 5.9 at.% with a surface area
of 30 0 0 m 2 g −1 and outstanding total pore volume of 2 cm 3 g −1 ,
respectively. The cell with such electrodes owning excellent struc-
tural properties and abundant nitrogen and oxygen atoms achieved
high capacitance of 368 F g −1 at a current density of 0.2 A g −1 and

low leakage current in the alkaline solution. Urea-modified lignin-
derived carbon electrodes were obtained by Wang and co-workers
to obtain a uniform distribution of nitrogen ( Fig. 15 a) and a large
number of mesopores ( Fig. 15 b) [240] . The symmetric supercapac-
itor fabricated by the electrodes exhibited specific capacitances of
273 F g −1  and 306 F g −1  at 0.1 A g −1  in 6 M KOH solution and
KOH-PVA  gel  electrolyte,  respectively.  In  addition  to  the  above-
mentioned  natural  nitrogen-containing  materials,  PPy  [241]  and
nitrogen-containing organic salts [242] are also effective nitrogen
sources. The addition of nitrogen-rich materials not only introduce
nitrogen into the electrodes but also help control the structure of
the electrodes. Through controlling the conditions of synthesizing
aniline  and  carbonization  temperatures,  N-doped  rod-shaped
porous lignin-based carbon was fabricated by Wang’s group [243] .
This material had a specific capacitance of 336 F g −1  and a tiny
resistance of 0.9 (cid:5) in a 6 M KOH solution since the N-doped ma-
terial had a large specific surface area, providing more active sites
to improve the wettability between the electrode and electrolyte.

N-doping  has  been  demonstrated  as  an  effective  way  to  im-
prove  the  capacitance  of  electrodes,  but  the  basic  properties  of
lignin may change when introducing nitrogen-rich materials which
can interact with lignin. This change is beneficial to the molding
process  of  lignin-derived  materials.  Yang  et  al.  produced  the  N-
doped carbon fiber electrode by pyrolysis of plant protein −lignin
electrospun fibers [244] . Due to the low molecular weight and low
viscosity of lignin solution, it was easier to create "beading" during
electrospinning, while the addition of protein was able to promote
the lignin to form better electrospun fibers and provide nitrogen
source.  The  prepared  electrode  possessed  a  high  capacitance  of
410 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 in 6 M KOH with a 95% capacitance retention
after  30 0 0  cycles.  In  addition  to  simple  physical  interactions,
highly  reactive  hydroxyl  groups  of  lignin  can  react  with  some
nitrogen-containing  functional  groups  of  nitrogen-rich  materials.
These  nitrogen-doped  materials,  as  nitrogen  sources  and  cross-
linking agents, not only provide nitrogen contents but also regulate
the  structure  of  lignin  by  a  suitable  crosslinking  process.  Zhang
et  al.  fabricated  a  3D  nitrogen-doped  hierarchical  porous  carbon
through  pyrolysis  and  activation  of  crosslinked  carbon  precursor
formed by crosslinking lignin with 1.6-hexanediamine [237] . The
N-doped  hierarchical  electrode  obtained  a  large  specific  surface
area of 1867.4 m 2  g −1  and a nitrogen content of 3.6 wt.% with a
structure that contained a large amount of micropores, favorable
mesopores,  and  interconnected  macropores.  Benefiting  from  this

unique structure, a high specific capacitance of 370 F g −1 at 0.5 A
g −1  and excellent capacitance retention of ∼95.1% retention after
30 0 0 cycles could be achieved.

Although transition metal oxides can provide high capacitance
through  redox  reactions,  they  generally  have  low  electrical  con-
ductivity, poor cycle stability, low rate performance, and high cost,
which  limit  their  applications for  high-performance supercapaci-
tors. An effective method is to incorporate transition metal oxides
with nanostructures into the conductive matrix. The lignin-based
carbon  material  is  such  an  excellent  conductive  matrix  with  a
low cost for this purpose. Chen et al. reported a liquid-crystalline
phase-templating approach to obtain NiO-containing mesoporous
carbon  materials  [245] .  Fig.  16 a  shows  the  process  of  preparing
NiO/lignin composite electrode (G-NiO/C) by in-situ carbonization
of nickel salt and lignin crosslinked with glutaraldehyde. As shown
in  Fig.  16 b  and  c,  the  NiO/lignin  composite  (G-NiO/C)  exhibited
a high specific surface area of 802 m 2  g −1  with a uniform hole
size of ∼3.7 nm and 70.6 wt.% metal oxide contents, which led to
an outstanding specific capacitance of 880.2 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 and
good rate performance (retention of 90.9% when the current den-
sity is from 1 A g −1 to 10 A g −1 ). Additionally, Xu and co-workers
prepared Cu-doped hierarchical porous carbon aerogels materials
2 activation of Cu-doped lignin-based aerogels
by pyrolysis and CO
[246] . The results showed that the incorporation of Cu played an
important role in improving the performance of the electrode. Cu
could produce a redox reaction in KOH solution to provide faradic
pseudocapacitance, which delivered a high specific capacitance of
285.97 F g −1 at 0.5 A g −1 . The redox reaction could be expressed
using the following Eqs. (1) , (2) :

In addition to the abovementioned composite electrodes, some
other  transition metal  oxide  modified lignin-based carbon mate-
rials, such as iron oxide decorated lignin-based carbon nanofibers
[247]  and  hollow  carbon  nanofibers  [234] ,  NiCo
4  modified
PAN/lignin-based  carbon  nanofiber  [248]  have  been  studied,
which  all  have  shown  better  electrochemical  performance  than
their  unmodified  counterparts.  For  example,  Yu  et  al.  fabricated
lignin-based  hollow  carbon  nanofibers  decorated  by  iron  oxide
using  poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile)  solution  as  the  core,  acetic
acid lignin as the shell and iron (III) acetylacetonate as the iron

oxide-precursor  additive  in  the  shell  [234] .  The  obtained  iron
oxide/hollow  carbon  nanofiber  composite  exhibited  a  specific
capacitance of 121 F g −1 at 0.5 A g −1 , which was 2.18 times that
of unmodified hollow carbon nanofibers.

As mentioned previously, lignin is rich in phenol groups which
can  store  energy  through  a  reversible  faradaic  redox  reaction.
However,  the  insulating  nature  of  lignin  hinders  the  utilization
of these functional redox groups. Similar to the strategy of metal
oxides/carbon  composite  electrodes,  some  scholars  have  tried  to
prepare composite electrodes with lignin and conductive polymers.
The conductive polymers can transport charge to lignin where the
charge could be stored by a reversible redox reaction of the phenol
groups.  Meanwhile,  lignin  sulfonates  contained  sulfonate  groups,
which play a similar role to the sulfonate groups in PSS and could
improve the electrical conductivity of poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythio-
phene) (PEDOT) [249] . Ajjan et al. synthesized PEDOT/lignin com-
posite electrodes by using PEDOT as a conductive network [249] .
Due to the contribution of pseudo-capacitance, the PEDOT/lignin
composite electrode had a capacity of 170.4 F g −1 which was twice
that of the PEDOT electrode (80.4 F g −1 ). Later on, Navarro-Suarez
et al. fabricated full-cell supercapacitors by using PEDOT/lignin as
the positive electrode and reduced graphite oxide as the negative
electrode to explore the application of electrode of PEDOT/lignin
in the device [250] . The asymmetric supercapacitor had a capac-
itance  of  34.6  F  g −1  at  0.1  A  g −1 .  However,  the  supercapacitor
maintained  52.2%  of  its  initial  capacitance  after  10 0 0  cycles,
which  was  explained  by  the  consumption  of  quinone  groups.
Then they prepared a composite electrode with PEDOT/lignin and
reduced  graphite  oxide.  Since  the  addition  of  reduced  graphite

oxide retarded the oxidation of quinone groups and improved the
electrical  conductivity  of  the  electrode,  the  symmetric  superca-
pacitor  assembled  by  this  electrode  had  a  higher  capacitance  of
36 F g −1 at 0.1 A g −1 and superior cyclability (maintain 79% of its
capacitance after 10 0 0 cycles). Moreover, the composite electrode
of  lignin/conductive  polymer  could  increase  the  capacitance  by
introducing a third component which can provide more pseudo-
capacitance  as  studied  by  Ajjan’s  group  [251] .  They  prepared  a
trihybrid electrode composed of poly(aminoanthraquinone) (PAAQ),
lignin, and PEDOT, which had an excellent specific capacitance of
418 F g −1 at a current density of 1 A g −1 .

Graphene and carbon nanotubes are excellent carbon materials
for energy storage systems because of their high electrical conduc-
tivity, large specific surface area, and excellent chemical stability.
However, it is extremely difficult to realize such high capacitance
for  the  reason  that  single-layer  graphene  and  carbon  nanotube
are  prone  to  restack  with  each  other  via  strong  Van  der  Waals
interactions [252] . Lignin consists of phenylpropanoid subunits in
3D spatial structure, which helps prevent the irreversible agglom-
erates of graphene and carbon nanotubes by the π –π interaction
[236] . Therefore, the combination of lignin with graphene and car-
bon nanotubes is an effective strategy to improve the performance
of lignin-based electrodes. Ye et al. utilized lignin as the reductant
and  morphology  directing  agent  to  obtain  lignin/RGO  composite
aerogel  electrode  through  hydrothermal  carbonization  [236] .  The
prepared lignin/RGO composite electrode had a high surface area
of  1804  m 2  g −1  and  exhibited  a  good  rate  capability  with  a
specific capacitance of 190 F g −1 at 0.5 A g −1 and 133.9 F g −1 at
10 A g −1 . Peng et al. fabricated a flexible solid supercapacitor by

gel as the electrolyte [235] . The Lignin/SWCNT
HNO3  gel electrode
exhibited a 3D network structure due to hydrogen and π –π in-
teraction between lignin and SWCNT. Moreover, the high electrical
conductivity  and  capacitance  of  SWCNT  and  the  electrochemical
activity  of  lignin  equipped  the  electrode  with  superior  electro-
chemical  performance.  The  assembled  supercapacitor  achieved  a
high specific capacitance of 292 F g −1 at 0.5 A g −1 , excellent rate
capability, and outstanding energy density of 17.1 Wh kg −1 with a
power density of 324 W kg −1 .

4.2. Electrolyte materials for supercapacitors

Few studies regarding the application of lignin as electrolytes
for supercapacitors have been reported. Currently, lignin is mainly
studied as an additive in electrolytes. Milczarek et al. found that
lignosulfonate  could  be  adsorbed  on  the  surface  of  the  carbon
electrode,  and  the  lignosulfonate  exhibited  redox  characteristics
after the initial redox reaction [253] .

2 SO

Meanwhile, the lignosulfonate could promote the movement of
electrolyte ions due to the presence of a sulfonic acid group. Lota
4 electrolyte
et al. added lignosulfonates as an additive to the H
[254] . The addition of lignosulfonates increased the specific capac-
itance by 33%, which was resulted from the redox reaction. As an
electrolyte additive, lignin can effectively increase the capacitance
of the supercapacitor through the faradaic reaction. However, the
solubility of  lignin in water limits the content  of phenol groups
contributed  by  pseudocapacitors  since  it  has  been  demonstrated
that lignosulfonates, which could be adsorbed on various carbon
electrodes, can form a redox active biofilm, resulting in an increase
in the pseudocapacitance [254–256] . More work regarding how to
increase the contents of pseudocapacitors through the addition of
lignin should be further explored.

5. Conclusions and perspectives

We have thoroughly reviewed and discussed the benefits, the
nature and production, and the recent progress in lignin-derived
materials for advanced rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors.
The  renewable  bioresource,  lignin,  is  considered  as  one  of  the
most  promising  candidates  for  high-performance  energy  storage
system due to its low cost and environmental-friendly nature. Un-
fortunately,  the  practical  application  of  lignin-derived  high-value
materials  is  still  greatly  limited  owing  to  some  obstacles  and
challenges.

Firstly,  applications  in  the  area  of  lignin-based  rechargeable
batteries and supercapacitors will significantly improve complete
high-value utilization of biomass, which can realize seamless joint
to the biorefinery. So far, only limited lignin sources (mostly alkali
lignin,  lignosulfonate,  and  organosolv  lignin)  have  been  investi-
gated in these areas. Therefore, it is crucial to research intensively
on lignin products of various plant types in different biorefinery
processes, especially for energy storage applications.

Secondly,  lignin  is  mainly  utilized  as  anode  materials  in  LIBs
and  SIBs.  As  a  promising  hard  carbon  precursor  derived  from
biomass,  lignin-based  anodes  exhibit  high  specific  capacity  and
good cycling stability. Because of the intercalation mechanism, the
storage capacities of lignin-based anodes by controlling the surface
area, morphology, and crystallinity of the lignin derived materials.
However, the high surface area of lignin derived material resulted
in a low initial Coulombic efficiency due to the closed micropores
in the hard carbon matrix. Therefore, optimum carbonization con-
ditions with high electrical conductivity and limited surface area
are favored in providing high storage capacity and high Coulombic
efficiency.  Additionally,  the  accessible  and  low-cost  prelithiation
approach  can  also  be  a  practicable  technique  to  compensate  for

the  initial  irreversible  capacity.  Fibrous-shaped  carbon  anodes
are  favored toward  high power  and  high-energy-density devices.
However,  the  fabrication  cost  of  lignin-based  carbon  nanofibers
is  high  due  to  the  addition  of  high  content  ( > 50 wt.%)  of  other
synthetic  polymers.  High-performance  biomass-derived  carbon
anodes with industrial-capable manufacturing process are required
to enable the further application of lignin in large-scale produc-
tion. Additionally, the rate capability of lignin-based anodes needs
to  be  further  improved  to  achieve  a  remarkable  breakthrough
in  LIBs  and  SIBs.  On  the  other  hand,  composite  anodes  with
alloying materials can provide even higher capacity but poor cycle
life.  Therefore,  advanced  and  sophisticated  carbon  structures  are
mostly required to overcome the huge volume expansion during
the lithiation process. An inexpensive and effective method for the
mass  production  of  these  composite  carbon  anodes  is  necessary
to  realize  the  true  benefits  of  biomass  materials  and  industrial
wastes. As a non-fluorinated and environmentally friendly binder,
lignin  displays  a  great  applied potential  as  binders  and  polymer
electrolytes.  While  the  broad  molecular  weight  distribution  and
low mechanical strength of lignin remain the major challenges for
use in recharge batteries. Efficient pretreatments to remove low-
molecular-weight lignin molecules are required to be developed to
improve the viscosity of lignin-based binder. In addition, structural
modification of lignin with synthetic polymers (e.g., PVA, PVP, etc.)
or inorganic particles (e.g., SiO
2 , etc.) can efficiently improve
2 , TiO
the mechanical strength of composite lignin membrane, which is
critical for its practical application as a robust matrix for polymer
electrolytes [166,168] .

Thirdly,  the  plentiful  oxygen  atoms  in  lignin  are  beneficial
for  increasing  electrolyte  ions  adsorption  and  producing  redox
reactions  for  supercapacitors.  Nevertheless,  lots  of  oxygen  atoms
in lignin would be lost during the pyrolysis at high temperatures.
Therefore, it is important to develop optimum carbonization and
activation  processes  which  can  provide  lignin  derived  electrodes
with  high  degree  of  carbonization  and  appropriate  amount  of
oxygen atoms. Appropriate amount of oxygen atoms can not only
enhance  the  compatibility  between  the  lignin  derived  materials
and other functional additives, but also increase electrolyte ion ad-
sorption and produce redox reactions for supercapacitors, making
lignin  a  useful  material  for  preparing  composite  electrodes  with
high  performance  [254–256] .  Though  there  are  several  reports
about  lignin  being  used  as  redox  additives  for  electrolytes,  its
limited  performance  contribution  makes  this  approach  be  im-
practical in a short term unless if its solubility in water could be
tremendously improved.

Overall,  the  progress  achieved  during  the  past  decades  has
been  significant,  even  though  there  are  still  many  challenges  to
overcome before realizing the commercial application of lignin in
the energy storage field. Major advances have been made in both
enhancing  the  performance  and  understanding  the  mechanisms
of using lignin-derived materials. We believe that further studies
by the research community will lead to more exciting results and
eventually practical high-value lignin-derived materials.
