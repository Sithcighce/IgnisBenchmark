Developing green energy solutions has become crucial to society. However, to develop a clean and
renewable energy system, significant developments must be made, not only in energy conversion
technologies (such as solar panels and wind turbines) but also regarding the feasibility and capabilities of
stationary electrical energy storage (EES) systems. Many types of EES systems have been considered such
as pumped hydroelectric storage (PHS), compressed air energy storage (CAES), flywheels, and electro-
chemical storage. Among them, electrochemical storage such as battery has the advantage of being more
efficient compared to other candidates, because it is more suitable in terms of the scalability, efficiency,
lifetime, discharge time, and weight and/or mobility of the system. Currently, rechargeable lithium ion
batteries (LIBs) are the most successful portable electricity storage devices, but their use is limited to
small electronic equipment. Using LIBs to store large amounts of electrical energy in stationary appli-
cations is limited, not only by performance but also by cost. Thus, a viable battery technology that can
store large amounts of electrical energy in stationary applications is needed. In this review, well-
developed and recent progress on the chemistry and design of batteries, as well as their effects on the
electrochemical performance, is summarized and compared. In addition, the challenges that are yet to be
solved and the possibilities for further improvements are explored.

1. Introduction

1.1. Need for electrical energy storage systems

Current oil- and nuclear-based energy systems have become
global issues. Recent news headlines are evidence of this, from the
BP-Gulf oil spill and nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi
Nuclear Power Plant to global demands for reduced greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions [1e3]. These challenges can be addressed by
developing smart cities that use a stable smart grid with a clean
energy power system [4]. Harnessing green energy from renewable
energy sources and storing it in electrical energy storage (EES)
systems for electrical power supply have been widely considered an
optimal solution for future smart city power systems. In such sys-
tems, energy can be generated from clean and renewable energy
resources such as solar, wind, and wave, but it is not constant and
reliable owing to its dependence on the weather, causing output
fluctuations, unavailability, and unpredictability [5]. Hence, the use
of large-scale stationary EES systems, combined with energy-
generation systems (solar panel, wind turbine, and water tur-
bine), has been considered to improve the reliability and overall
usefulness of the power systems, since they provide various kinds
of grid services such as frequency regulation, spinning reserve, and
improved power quality [6].

EES can be highly practical for load leveling services, which store
electrical energy whenever the renewable system generates too
much energy for a given demand, and supplies electrical energy to
the grid system when it generates too little energy, as shown in
Fig. 1 [7]. For the best impact of EES on smart cities, it should
provide grid stability through flexibility, fast energy injection, and
extraction, as well as enhance the power quality by supply security.
To meet the above requirements, many types of ESS systems have
been extensively investigated, which are described based on how
the electrical energy is stored (Fig. 2) [8,9]. Among them, potential
energy storage systems such as commercial pumped hydroelectric
storage (PHES) and compressed air energy storage (CAES) have
been conventionally considered, because their power can reach up
to GW levels for bulk energy storage, with a low life-cycle capital
cost ($50e200/kWh) [10]. PHES uses stored water at a relatively
high elevation (water potential) to produce electricity. When the
electricity demand is low, the extra electrical energy is used to
pump water back to the upper reservoir, and then the stored water
is allowed to activate a turbine, generating high-value electricity (a
few tens of GW to MW) for peak hour supply [11]. This system has a

conversion efficiency of 65e80%, and its capacity is dependent on
the elevation and the volume of the stored water. CAES has also
been considered as a good candidate for an EES system because it
can store a large amount of electrical energy at more than 100 MW.
This system has a fast energy conversion and storage process, and
therefore, it is suitable for daily operations under partial and rapid
load conditions [12,13].

Compressed air energy storage (CAES)

is the only other
commercially available technology capable of providing very large
energy storage deliverability (above 100 MW with single unit),
except Pumped Hydroelectric Storage (PHS). CAES works on the
basis of conventional gas turbine generation. It decouples the
compression and expansion cycles of a conventional gas turbine
into two separated processes and stores the energy in the form of
elastic potential energy of compressed air. CAES consists of five
classifications on components, which is motor (generator), air
compressor, turbine train, cavity (container) and equipment con-
trols. The motor/generator that employs clutches to provide alter-
nate engagement
to the compressor or turbine trains. Air
compressor with intercoolers and after-coolers is to achieves
economy of compression and reduce the moisture content of the
compressed air. Turbine train contains both high and low pressure
turbines. A cavity/container for storing compressed air, which can
be underground rock caverns created by excavating comparatively
hard and impervious rock formations, salt caverns created by so-
lution of salt formations, and porous media reservoirs made by
water-bearing aquifers gas fields, e.g. sandstone and fissured lime.
Equipment controls are like fuel storage and heat exchanger units
[12,13]. CAES stores the energy by compressing air as an elastic
potential energy. It has separate compression and expansion pro-
cesses. During low demand, the extra electrical energy is stored in
the form of compressed air in air storage vessels. When the demand
is high, the compressed air is converted to electrical energy through
an energy conversion process using a high-pressure turbine. CAES
has an eco-friendly system, long storage period (>1 year), low
capital cost ($50e110/kWh), and a storage efficiency of 70e89%.

In kinetic energy storage systems, flywheel technologies have
been attractive, over the past few decades, for bulk energy storage
applications [14]. This system utilizes the energy in the angular
momentum of a spinning mass. The energy is stored by spinning
the flywheel using an electric motor. When needed, the motor
generates electrical energy from the rotational energy of the
flywheel. The overall system is dependent on the size and speed of
the rotor, and the power rating is determined by the motor-

generator. The main advantage of a flywheel is its long lifetime
(several hundreds of thousands of full cycles), and additionally it
has a high storage efficiency (up to 90e95%). This system is mainly
applied to the high power/short duration EES applications (e.g.,
100s of kW/10s of seconds), which provide support power during
interruptions, for short time periods or when shifting from one
power source to another. The disadvantages of the flywheel tech-
nology are a high rate of self-discharge caused by a high frictional
loss, a high initial cost, and a low energy density [15]. These
drawbacks of the above systems make them useful in only a limited
range of applications.

Table 1 describes EES technologies that have been commonly
considered. Depending on the application of the system, each
storage design is more suitable in terms of the efficiency, lifetime,
discharge time, and weight and/or mobility of the system. The
limitations for each type of technology are also summarized. For
examples, PHES requires available sites for two large reservoirs
with different elevations and a long lead time (>10 years) and in-
volves a high cost for the construction, as well as environmental
considerations [16]. CAES's main barrier is to find a favorable
geographical location, as it requires a gas turbine system, involving
combustion of fossil fuels, resulting in contaminating emissions
[16,17]. Among these various energy storage systems, electro-
chemical storage systems such as batteries have the advantage of
being more efficient compared with PHES and CAES storage, as
described below. They can be located anywhere, without
geographical considerations, which allows them to be installed
near residential areas. Its size can be designed for applications
ranging from a few kWh to several MWh. It can be simultaneously
applied to both power and energy management applications [9,18].
A battery works by directly converting chemical energy into
electrical energy by employing various chemical reactions. The LIB

is based on a cathode and an anode, which has the property of
reversible insertion and extraction of ions. Transfer of ions is
enabled by the addition of an organic liquid electrolyte and a me-
chanical separator between the anode (negative electrode) and the
cathode (positive electrode). When the ion is inserted and extrac-
ted in the cathode and the anode, electrical energy is generated by
electrochemical oxidation and reduction. The wide range of
different combinations of anode, cathode, and electrolyte materials
available for different cell chemical reactions can be used to
develop numerous types of batteries such as Li-ion, lead-acid,
NaeS, and vanadium redox batteries.

Presently, the rechargeable Li-ion battery is the most common
type of battery used in consumer portable electronics due to its
high energy density per weight or volume and high efficiency.
However, the Li-ion battery for use in stationary energy storage
applications is limited owing to its high cost (>$1000/kWh). For
renewable energy to be stored without government subsidy, the
cost of storage process must be kept below $200/kWh [19].
Considering many aspects, including cost, life-time, efficiency, po-
wer, and energy density, many battery systems have been applied
for large-scale energy storage applications. In this review, we
categorized battery systems according to their degree of develop-
ment
for stationary applications and offer a comprehensive
description of each battery to provide a better understanding of
how it works. More specifically, the principle of operation of each
system will be demonstrated, along with its status and the chal-
lenges regarding applied chemistry.

the two half-cell reactions:

O þ R / Onþ þ Rn(cid:2)

In the electrochemical cell, if a current of I (A, ampere) flows
through external circuit for a time of t (s, second), the amount of
transferred charge, Q (C, coulomb), is equal to It. Also, the number
of moles, Nm, of the reactants, O or R consumed by the applied
charge is given by:

Nm 1⁄4 It

where n is the number of electrons given or accepted by O or R, NA
is Avogadro's number, e is the charge on an electron, and F is the

The driving force to work an electrochemical cell is the decrease
in the standard free energy, DG0, of the cell reaction, which is given
by:

DG0 1⁄4 (cid:2)nFE0

where E0 is the potential difference between the cathode and the
anode. Here, a positive value of E0 indicates that the cell reaction
occurs spontaneously. However, when current I is applied to the
cell, an irreversible energy loss, as waste heat, is induced by the
polarized resistance components [20]. The polarizations can be
classified into three types: activation polarization that is related to
the kinetics of electrochemical reaction at the interface between
electrode and electrolyte, concentration polarization that is caused
by mass transport limitation, and ohmic polarization that is related
to contact resistance within cell. These different polarization losses
lead to a voltage drop as a function of operating current, as shown
in Fig. 3b, and the operating voltage, Eop, is given by:

conductor. At the electrode faced with electrolyte, electron transfer
causes oxidation or reduction to occur, which the amount of
chemical reactions caused by the flow of current is proportional to
the amount of electricity passed. This charge transfer reaction is
governed by Faraday's law, and the rate of current flow (i) in
charge-transfer reaction can be controlled by ButlereVolmer
formulation as:

where Eoc is the open-circuit voltage (i.e., the potential difference
between the electrodes) and h is the overvoltage (i.e., a deviation in
the equilibrium open-circuit voltage from its theoretical value,
caused mainly by polarization). Therefore, the available energy can
be maximized, when the cell is close to the open-circuit voltage,
because its value is associated with the cell capacity and average
operating voltage:

During the discharge reaction, an anode, O, is oxidized and

electrons are delivered to an external circuit:

The cathode, R, accepts electrons from the external circuit,

resulting in a reduction reaction:

(cid:2) / Rn(cid:2)

Meanwhile, the electrolyte provides a pathway for ionic trans-
port, as the medium for charge transfer, and a separator gives a
physical barrier to prevent electrical shorting between the anode

where ε is the available energy, and Qsp is the specific capacity
obtained by dividing the capacity, Q, by the mass, m, or volume, V,
of the cell.

For energy determination, the equilibrium voltage, Eoc, and the
capacity of the cell, Q, are very important parameters, which are
mainly determined by the intrinsic properties of the electrode
materials. Thus, a cell with a maximized energy can be designed by
selecting anode materials with a smaller work function, FA, and
cathode materials with a larger work function, FC [21]. The sche-
matic energy diagram is illustrated in Fig. 4. The open-circuit

considered extensively in electrochemical systems to decrease
ohmic polarization (or IR drop). Moreover, to decrease activation
polarization, the electrode should be designed as a porous structure
that can reduce the local current density by its enhanced surface
area and facilitate mass transport while minimizing concentration
polarization.

2. Batteries for EES applications

2.1. Lead-acid battery

Since the development of an original lead-acid battery by Gas-
ton Plant(cid:1)e in 1859, it has been adapted for use in various applica-
tions, from starting engines in electric vehicles (EVs) to EES in
renewable energy systems [20,22e25]. This system consists of lead
dioxide (PbO2) as a positive electrode and metallic lead (Pb) with
high surface area as a negative electrode. Its discharge mechanism,
called the double-sulfate reaction, is illustrated in Fig. 5 [26,27]. It
(cid:2)
utilizes the electrode reactions of Pb oxidation (Pb / Pb2þ þ 2e
)
and PbO2 reduction (Pb4þ þ 2e
) during discharge,
resulting in the formation PbSO4 product at both electrodes. This
process is reversible under charging/discharging conditions. The
reactions are described below:

(cid:2) / Pb2þ

Negative electrode:

Pb # Pb2þ þ 2e

(cid:2)

Pb2þ þ SO4

2(cid:2) # PbSO4

Positive electrode:

PbO2 þ 4H

þ þ 2e

(cid:2) # Pb2þ þ 2H2O

Pb2þ þ SO4

2(cid:2) # PbSO4

Overall reaction:

Pb þ PbO2 þ 2H2SO4 # 2PbSO4 þ 2H2O

As shown in this process, sulfuric acid (H2SO4) in an aqueous
electrolyte is consumed to produce PbSO4 and H2O during the
discharge; H2SO4 can be an additional active component that limits
the electrochemical performance of the lead-acid battery system.
The overall reaction in the cell provides a standard voltage of 2.1 V,
and an acceptable end-voltage on a moderate discharging is 1.75 V
per cell. The open circuit voltage changes, depending on an elec-
trolyte concentration, which indicates that the state of charge in the
lead-acid battery system can be determined by measuring the
relative density of the sulfuric acid. However, when the cell is
overcharged, at a higher value than ~2.39 V, the aqueous electrolyte
(cid:2) / H2) at the
decomposes by evolution of hydrogen (2H
negative and oxygen (H2O (cid:2) 2e
) at the positive
electrodes, respectively. This leads to loss of water in the electro-
lyte, requiring maintenance by adding water.

Lead-acid batteries have been introduced in various electrical
power applications due to their advantage of ease of manufacture,
from 1 Ah to ~1000 Ah-sized products. This battery type can also
provide a moderate range of power from kWs to a few ten's of
MWs, a moderate electrical efficiency (>70%), and a long lifetime
(3e12 yr), as well as a relatively low-cost range [22,28]. In addition,
the cell components (especially lead) can be efficiently recycled, at
a high rate of 97% from used batteries. However, the cycle-life of the
lead acid battery can be limited. A lead sulfate layer can form on the
surface of the negative electrode during period of high discharge
rate, which is not completely reversible during the recharging
process [29,30]. This eventually reduces the electrode area for the
electrochemical reactions, resulting in poor cycle life performance.
In addition, charging of the cell at a high current induces hydrogen
generation, which also leads to poor cycle efficiency and an ex-
plosion hazard [29,31].

To improve the cycle-life extension of a lead acid battery, carbon
has been tested for use in negative electrodes, because a small
concentration (0.15e0.25 wt%) in the negative electrode was re-
ported to reduce the PbSO4 accumulation on the electrode surface
[32e34]. When the negative lead electrode is completely replaced
by high-surface-area carbon, called the leadecarbon (PbC) asym-
metric system, nucleation and growth of PbSO4 are eliminated due
to that absence of any chemical reaction taking place on the negative

electrode, which greatly enhances the cycle-life performance [35].
On the other hand, an advanced lead acid system, with a split design
for the negative electrode (known as ultra-battery), is demonstrated
as shown in Fig. 6. This system uses a Pb electrode connected in
parallel with a modified carbon electrode as the negative electrode,
with one PbO2 electrode as the positive electrode. This configuration
provides a high capacity and significantly longer cycle-life compared
to the traditional lead acid battery; the split design of the ultra-
battery system exhibits an improvement of 50% in discharge po-
wer, 60% in charge power, and ~17000 cycles [36].

Regardless of improvements such as the lead acid ultra-battery
system, lower cost and higher discharge durations are still required
for stationary EES applications. In the case of capital cost, the value
for the ultra-battery system ($500/kWh) is higher than that for a
valve-regulated lead-acid system ($200/kWh), but it is possible to
reduce the cost by increasing the scale of production. Even though
the lead acid battery system is only used in EES applications that
require relatively short discharge durations, the lead acid ultra-
battery system could be available for large-scale energy storage
with a high power and energy if the cost and discharge duration
issues can be overcome.

2.2. NaeS battery

Since the introduction of the sodiumesulfur (NAS) battery sys-
tem in the 1970s, this technology is considered an attractive
candidate for large-scale EES application due to the abundance of
Na and its low redox potential, high theoretical specific energy
(cid:2)1), and cycling flexibility [9,37,38]. The NAS system is
(~760 Wh kg
constructed in a tubular design, as shown in Fig. 7. This system is
composed of Na as an anode, S as a cathode, and beta-alumina
(Al2O3) as a solid electrolyte and a separator. The cell needs to be
operated at high temperatures, between 300 and 350 (cid:3)C, which are
required to maintain Na and S in molten states and ensure efficient
Na ion transportation through the ceramic solid electrolyte [39].

ions. These Na

During the discharge process, Na at a negative electrode is
oxidized, giving Na
ions move through the solid
electrolyte and react with S at the positive electrode, forming
disodium pentasulfide (Na2S5). Na2S5 separates from the remaining
S and yields a two-phase liquid mixture. However, the two-phase
liquid mixture is gradually transformed to the single-phase so-
dium polysulfide with higher sulfur content (Na2S5(cid:2)x) until the
remaining S is completely consumed. The above chemical reactions
are reversible during the charge process, and the overall reactions
are as follows:

Positive electrode:

xS þ 2Na

þ þ 2e

(cid:2) # Na2Sx

Overall reaction:

2Na þ xS # Na2Sx

At 350 (cid:3)C, the NAS battery exhibits a constant voltage of 2.07 V
until 60e75% of the discharge process has taken place, representing
a two-phase mixture of S and Na2S5. Next, the voltage starts to
decrease linearly (corresponding to the formation of single-phase
Na2Sx), and approach 1.78 V at the end of the discharge [40]. For
the NaeS system, the level of cell voltage and energy efficiency
(75e90%) is similar to that of the lead-acid system, but it shows an
enhanced cycle-life (2500 yr) with five times higher energy density
than the lead-acid system.

In this battery system, the solid state electrolyte that is mainly
used is based on beta-alumina ceramic (bʺ-Al2O3) due to its
(cid:2)1 at 300 (cid:3)C [41e43].
adequate ionic conductivity of 0.2e0.4 S cm
The high ionic conductivity of bʺ-Al2O3 is the result of an unusual
structure in which blocks of closely packed Al-O are separated by
conduction planes. The conduction planes are loosely packed layers
ion along with O2-ions that bridge
that contain the mobile Na
adjacent blocks. Ion motion occurs in the two-dimensional hon-
eycomb-like pathway around the bridging oxygen. The crystal
structure and electrochemical behavior of bʺ-Al2O3 have been
further stabilized and improved by introducing Li
ions
into the structure to yield an ideal composition [44].

This solid electrolyte is one of the key elements, which deter-
mine both the battery performance and cost. The sealing material
for the solid electrolyte also has very important elements for the
NAS battery system. If both the electrodes, in the liquid state, come
into direct contact with each other at a high temperature, severe
fires and explosions occur. For instance, a NAS battery incident
occurred in 2011 because the molten active materials flowed over
the sealing materials between blocks, causing a continuous short-
circuit between the battery cells [45]. Glass-ceramic sealants
based on borosilicate have been widely considered to prevent the
direct contact between two molten electrodes. These have high
strength and chemical stability, no phase transformation, little
stress variation during thermal operations, and controllable ther-
mal expansion displaying a favorable performance [46,47]. Bi-
doped borosilicate has also been introduced as an attractive
sealant due to its well-matched thermal expansion between glasses
and solid electrolytes [48].

Another major issue for NAS batteries is that the discharged

materials as electrical conductors to provide efficient electron-
transport. Additionally,

required [44,49].

the highly corrosive behavior of

The use of the NAS battery has been considered for load-leveling
or peak shaving in large-scale EES applications with ~65% market
share [50]. However, this system still requires further safety pre-
cautions and initial cost-reduction (currently about $350/kWh),
along with improved cell engineering [10]. Moreover, one of the
main issues is to reduce the operating temperature, which allows
one to select more cost-effective materials for the cells, with better
material durability and the ability to handle thermally efficient
management. To solve the high operation temperature problem,
extensive work has been performed to decrease the operating
temperature by the use of polymers or organic solvents as the
catholytes [51e55]. For example, the utilization of a solid electro-
lyte with a catholyte solvent enhanced the interfacial conduction
and the mobility of components in the cathode at lower tempera-
ture [56]. Since the NAS battery has been widely applied in large-
scale EES applications, the advanced technology to devise protec-
tive layers for electrodes, and the development of improved elec-
trolytes hold promise for the future of the lower-temperature NAS
cell for large-scale EES.

2.3. Li-ion battery

Among various rechargeable batteries, lithium ion batteries
(LIBs) have been considered for use in the large-scale EES market
because LIBs show the highest energy density, cycle stability, and
energy efficiency. Conventionally, this battery system uses Li tran-
sitional metal oxides as the cathodes, carbon as the anodes, and
non-aqueous carbonated liquids as the electrolytes, as shown in
Fig. 8 [57]. During the charging process, the Li ion is transferred
across the electrolyte from the anode host structure to the cathode
electrode, and these chemical reactions are highly reversible. For
example, the Li1(cid:2)xCoO2/LixC6 configuration has been widely stud-
ied, which has led to it being commercially applied in mobile
equipment. The overall reaction is as shown below:

Positive electrode:

Negative electrode:

energy densities of 75e200 Wh kg

The Li-ion battery system can operate at ~3.7 V, while exhibiting
(cid:2)1 or
high specific
(cid:2)1. This high energy density performance makes it
150e315 Wh l
attractive for use in weight or volume sensitive applications [58].
Also, the Li-ion battery exhibits a low self-discharge rate of below
8% per month, a long cycle-life (>1000 cycles), and wide operating
temperature ranges ((cid:2)20 to 60 (cid:3)C for charge and (cid:2)40 to 65 (cid:3)C for
discharge) [59]. Its main drawbacks are high cost, limited thermal
tolerance, and requirement for a protective system against cell
degradation and thermal runaway due to electrolyte decomposi-
tion [57]. Although the use of a solid polymer as the electrolyte in
Li-ion battery systems enabled enhancement of safety and more
flexibility, the design cost increased, which lead to a decreased
scope for scalability.

Nowadays, although Li-ion batteries have taken over a large
proportion of the field of portable electronic devices, stationary EES
applications still face several challenges. The first consideration is
its high energy cost (>$500/kWh), which is 2e5 times higher than

Fig. 8. The schematic view of Li-ion battery consisting of intercalation compounds
during discharge.

91

the required cost for stationary applications [10,60,61]. Also, ther-
mal management needs to be efficiently operated in a large-scale
application with MW levels, which is closely related to safety
considerations and the extension of cycle-life. The heat generated
from the Li-ion battery has induced thermal instability of a flam-
mable organic electrolyte, and this issue would become more
important in a large-scale EES application [62].

Recently, to meet the cost and safety requirements for EES ap-
plications, Li-ion batteries have been designed using LiFePO4 as the
cathode and Li4Ti5O12 as the anode [63e65]. Li4Ti5O12 shows zero
straining Li-intercalation/de-intercalation behavior with a specific
(cid:2)1 and exhibits a voltage plateau at 1.55 V vs.
capacity of 175 mAh g
Li. Although the voltage of Li4Ti5O12 is relatively high for anode
applications, it shows an excellent cycling stability and safety
compared to those of the commercially used carbon anode (0.2 V
vs. Li), because the operating voltage for Li4Ti5O12 is beyond the
electrolyte decomposition voltage (<0.8 V vs. Li). As a cathode,
LiCoO2 is still used in most lithium batteries due to the high energy
density and the good cycle performance. In the layered structure of
LiCoO2, the oxygen anions form a close-packed fcc lattice with
cations located in the six coordinated octahedral crystal site. The
CoO2 slabs and Li layers are stacked alternatively. However, Co of
LiCoO2 is relatively expensive and toxic. Moreover, O2 induced ex-
plosion could be easily evaluated in the CoO2 slab with undesirable
condition such as overcharge and high temperature.

LiFePO4 is considered a promising candidate due to its low cost
and the inclusion of many environmentally benign elements. In
addition, LiFePO4 has a durable crystal structure comprising
bonding between iron and oxygen, leading to stable and reversible
electrochemical performances for many cycles of Li intercalations
into its structure, as well as avoiding thermal runaway at high
temperatures [66e69]. LiFePO4 is olivine, which is the hexagonal
analog of spinel, containing a slightly distorted hcp anion array with
half of the octahedral sites and one edge of octahedral occupied by
cations. In the olivine, two types of octahedral sites are energeti-
cally distinguishable, possibly leading to an ordering of different
cations between them (ordered olivine), as in LiFePO4. The struc-
ture is composed of PO4 tetrahedra and FeO6 octahedra. Thus, Li
atoms occupy chains of edge-shared octahedra running parallel to
the c-axis, in alternate aec planes, while the Fe atoms occupy zig-
zag chains of corner-shared octahedra running parallel to the c-axis
in the other aec planes [69]. The aec planes containing the Li atoms
(cid:2)1),
are bridged by PO4 tetrahedra. Its capacity is good (~170 mAh g
but its working voltage is relatively low (~3.45 V vs. Li). So, LiMnPO4
and LiCoPO4 attract attention due to their high operation potential
(Mn 1⁄4 4.4 V, Co 1⁄4 4.9 V). The Li-ion battery system can be used as a
large-scale EES system, provided further requirements can be
accommodated within a cost-effective range.

2.4. Redox flow battery: all-vanadium

For large-scale EES systems with power 10 kWe10 MW, the
redox flow battery (RFB) is an attractive candidate when consid-
ering its cost, mobility, depth of discharge, fast response, and safety,
and comparing them to those of LIBs and the NAS system [70]. RFB
stores electrical energy, typically in two soluble redox couples
contained in external electrolyte tanks sized in accordance with
application requirements. Liquid electrolytes are pumped from
storage tanks to flow-through electrodes where chemical energy is
converted to electrical energy. The RFB has exhibited a high energy
efficiency that is induced by electrochemical reactions of redox
couples in liquid solutions. Among the various redox couples, the
all-vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) shows an excellent elec-
trochemical performance [71]. A typical VRFB system consists of
two external reservoirs, containing soluble electroactive species

/V5þ

(V4þ
as the positive electrode chemicals and V2þ
as the
negative electrode chemicals) and two stacked electrodes. These
two sections are separated by an ion-exchange membrane and have
a pumped circulation system (Fig. 9). The electrochemical reaction
described below occurs:

The standard open circuit voltage (OCV) is 1.26 V, and the
voltage is increased to 1.6 V in the fully charged state for the cell
system with 2 M VOSO4 in 2.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte [72]. The VRFB
system can be applied in the temperature range varying from 10 to
~40 (cid:3)C [73]. The solubility of VOSO4 has been confirmed to decrease
with increasing H2SO4 concentration. The solubility of VOSO4
increased with temperature, and the effect was more significant at
a lower H2SO4 concentration. Generally, this system can achieve an
energy efficiency of up to 85%, with a 12,000 year cycle-life. Since
the same vanadium species with different oxidation states is used
in each cell, the VRFB system does not have cross-contamination
problems. This enables the electrolyte to be recycled in the cell,
leading to a long cycle-life and a reduction in the cost of the battery
system. Also, the fast electrochemical reactions of vanadium redox
couples allow the VRFB to become highly discharged/charged in a
short time period [71]. However, VRFB has several drawbacks for
practical applications. The main problem is its low specific energy
(cid:2)1). The energy density of the VRFB is
density (10e30 Wh kg
strongly related to the concentration of vanadium ions in the liquid
H2SO4 solution, and its maximum concentration is limited by the
precipitation of solid vanadium compounds [74e77]. For example,
increasing the concentration over 2 M in anH2SO4 supporting
electrolyte led to the formation of V2O5 precipitates in the V(V)
electrolyte at a temperature above 40 (cid:3)C and VO in V(II) or V(III)
solutions below 10 (cid:3)C. Several approaches have been tried to in-
crease the stability and solubility of vanadium in the liquid solution.
The stability of vanadium with sulfuric acid could be improved to
some extent by adding some organic or inorganic chemicals as
stabilizing agents. However, the vanadium concentration in the
electrolyte and its effect on the electrochemical performance (such

as state of charge and energy density) still remain as the main
challenges in VRFB.

The high oxidizing ability of V5þ

should be addressed to main-
tain the overall system for the fully charged positive electrode
electrolyte, because it easily degrades the membrane and the
positive electrode materials [18,78]. The V5þ
oxidizing ability limits
the choice of materials for the membrane and the positive elec-
TM
trode. New types of Selemion
anion exchange membranes or
®
Nafion
cation exchange membranes are used, and carbon or
graphite felt is used as the electrode.

At present, although the all-VRFB system has been widely used
in applications for load-leveling and investigated for unin-
terruptible power supply (UPS) use due to its excellent electro-
chemical reversibility, cost reduction is still essential for stationary
EES applications. Vanadium is still expensive ($7e$14 per pound).
Moreover, the membrane is the highest priced component of the
VRFB system, therefore, low-cost alternatives should be considered
[39]. A modified perfluorinated membrane has been developed to
reduce the cost, with an energy efficiency of 80% in 5e10 kW bat-
tery stacks [79]. If ion exchange membranes are continuously
developed with enhanced electrochemical properties such as low
vanadium ion permeability, good chemical stability, and oxidation
resistance toward V5þ
, their use can further reduce the cost of VRFB
and improve its performance. Another issue for the further devel-
opment of VRFB relates to the carbon-based electrode materials
[80e82]. The current electrode materials can generate a current
(cid:2)2 with good energy efficiency, but
density of up to 100 mA cm
further improvements are needed to increase stack power density,
combined with reduction of stack cost per kW power output [83].
In addition to the electrode/membrane materials, the design of the
overall system is also important to improve electrochemical per-
formance and build cost-effective systems [39]. For optimized
performance, the electrodes are required to have a high surface
area, suitable porosity, low electronic resistance, and high electro-
chemical activity toward the reactions. To minimize resistance and
power loss, the membrane is required to have a high ionic con-
ductivity and the fast ionic transport must be highly selective about
vanadium cations. Also, low cost of membrane is critically impor-
tant for commercializing the technology.

In the present design, a parasitic current appears because the
electrodes in the stack cells are fed with pumped electrolyte in par-
allel, which leads to self-discharge and energy loss. The shunt current
is also lost due to the voltage difference between stack cells, inducing
corrosion of materials of the cell stack with associated capacity loss
[84]. Accordingly, if a VRFB system is designed to eliminate electrical
leakage currents with the improvements of other components, it can
further improve the electrochemical performance as well as incur
cost reductions for stationary EES applications.

3. Recent progress in battery for EES applications

Although the commercialized batteries are widely installed in
stationary applications, their energy density is still insufficient for
large-scale EES systems due to the intrinsic limitations such as low
capacity and low operation voltage in the currently used electrode
materials for batteries. A major research trend is moving to
potentially high-capacity electrodes such as metal anodes and air
cathodes. Additionally, to be competitive for EES systems, the cost
of batteries should be reduced while maintaining or enhancing
their electrochemical performances. Therefore, new battery tech-
nology is highly important to provide successful EES requirement
parameters such as high energy density, low cost, high safety, and
environmental compatibility. In this chapter, we review the sug-
gested battery technologies, including their principles and com-
ponents developed, for stationary EES systems.

3.1. Metal-air battery: Zn-air

Metal-air batteries have attracted attention due to them having
higher theoretical energy densities than other battery systems
mentioned in Chapter 2 (Fig. 10). Metal-air batteries generally
consist of a metal anode, air-cathode, a separator, and metal-ion
conducting electrolyte (Fig. 11). A critical component of all metal-
air batteries is the air cathode. Typically, it consists of a nano-
porous carbon network immersed in a liquid electrolyte with
interpenetrating gas phase. The liquid electrolyte can be aqueous or
non-aqueous, and this choice has a large influence on the reaction
pathways and products. During the discharge process, the metal
anode is oxidized, which provides free electrons, and the oxygen
accepts the released electrons at the cathode electrode, forming
oxygen-containing species as the reduction products. The oxidized
metal ions and oxygen-reduced species migrate through the elec-
trolyte, and they are combined to form metal oxides. These reactions
are reversible, by forming metal at the anode and generating oxygen
at the cathode, during charging of the battery. The main consider-
ations for metal-air batteries are the low efficiency of the anode
utilization and the slow kinetics of the cathode reaction [85,86]. For
the air cathode, the use of a catalyst is required to improve the ox-
ygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the liquidegasesolid interfaces.
Due to the low solubility of oxygen in the liquid electrolyte, the
degree of oxygen transport in the electrolyte also plays a key role in
improving electrochemical performance [87,88]. For the metal
anode, the precipitation of metal oxides, hydroxides, or other spe-
cies on the metal anode surface impedes the discharge process due
to the decrease in electrolyte contact [85].

Recently, among the various metal-air batteries, the Zn-air
battery system has been considered for a stationary EES applica-
tion due to the abundance resources, low cost, and environmental
compatibility of Zn. In the Zn-air battery, the air cathode electrode
consists of a catalytic active layer and a gas diffusion layer as
schematically illustrated in Fig. 12. When oxygen is introduced into
the porous electrode, the catalyst of the electrode accelerates the
ORR to form hydroxyl ions in the alkaline electrolyte. The hydroxyl
ions move to the zinc anode and contribute to the formation of zinc
oxides (the final product) during the discharge process. An addi-
tional chemical reaction possibly occurs, leading to the evolution of
hydrogen gas at the negative electrode; therefore, the suppression
of hydrogen evolution is needed to increase the capacity of this
system [89,90]. The overall
reactions during discharge are
described below:

Fig. 10. The comparison of theoretical specific energy density of electrochemical en-
ergy storage system [71,156,157].

93

theoretical specific energy density of
the Zn-air battery is
(cid:2)1, but the operating voltage is less than the theoretical
1350 Wh kg
value due to internal polarization of the cell [91,92]. There are
several challenges such as the electrochemical stability of the
cathode during charging, dendrite formation at the zinc electrode,
zinc dissolution, limited oxygen solubility in the electrolyte, and the
higher value of polarization when charging than discharging [93].
Therefore, these challenges should be addressed before using Zn-
air battery systems in EES applications. Each part of this chal-
lenge and its solution is discussed below.

Negative Electrode: Pure Zn metal is utilized as the negative
electrode in Zn-air battery systems, where Zn metal is oxidized and
transformed to zinc oxide when discharging. The morphology of
the Zn electrode is transformed during cycling of the battery due to
the uncontrolled dissolution of Zn in the electrolyte. The contin-
uous precipitation of ZnO forms and grows a dendrite, that even-
tually touches the positive electrode, which results in a short-
circuit [94]. In order to efficiently utilize the zinc electrode, modi-
fication of its surface area has been mainly considered in order to
optimize the reaction rate with an alkaline electrolyte [95e97]. In
addition to Zn's precipitation problem, the evolution of hydrogen
(H2) gas, caused by the corrosion of Zn, is also a major drawback,
resulting in an increased pressure in the battery during cycling. To
overcome these problems, use of a zinc alloy with other metals has
been attempted [98,99]. However, because some of the possible
introduced metals such as Hg and Pb are toxic and can cause
environmental problems, only Ni- or In-based alloys have been
used to fabricate a zinc alloy electrode with high electrochemical
performance [100]. Also, a method of coating the Zn surface with
other materials has been introduced to prevent direct contact be-
tween Zn and the electrolyte, which can increase discharge ca-
pacity with low gas evolution [101,102].

(cid:2)

Separator: A separator plays a key role in allowing transport of
solely hydroxyl ions (OH
) from the air electrode to zinc electrode.
It should have a high ionic conductivity, a suitable porosity, not be
electrically conductive, high absorption of electrolyte, stability in
alkaline solution, and the ability to retard of ZnO dendrite forma-
tion. Among the various kinds of separator candidates, poly-
ethylene oxide and polyvinyl alcohol have been widely used due to
their appropriate properties in alkaline-based applications. A
membrane based on the mesoporous molecular sieve MCM-41 has
recently been developed [93,103e106]. Use of the mesoporous
molecular sieve MCM-41 membrane increases the power density
and volumetric energy density of the Zn-air cell, which are com-
parable to commercial values, such as for Duracell's DA 675 model,
which has high energy density of 442 Wh/kg with 600 mAh
capacity.

Electrolyte: Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is widely used as the
electrolyte for the Zn-air battery due to its high ionic conductivity,
which can be further improved by increasing the concentration of
KOH [107]. However, the use of more than the critical concentration
(~30% of KOH) can lead to a viscosity increase for the electrolyte and
ZnO formation. The hydroxyl ions in the electrolyte are highly
reactive with carbon dioxide, which contributes to the formation of
carbonates. This results in capacity loss for the battery. Hence, the
use of absorbents in a cell has been considered to reduce the CO2
concentration [108e110], significantly reducing the CO2 concen-
tration to below 20 ppm for compact device designs [107e110].

Positive Electrode: The air cathode in a Zn-air cell comprises a
catalyst for ORR and a porous carbon structure. The porous struc-
ture of the electrode can provide a high diffusion pathway for ox-
ygen in air and houses the catalyst materials. However, when the
cell operates, the porous electrode structure can be clogged or
collapsed by the discharged or decomposed products such as po-
tassium carbonate, resulting in capacity loss [94]. For the air

The service life of the zinc air battery is significantly affected by
pressure differences between the vapor pressure of the electrolyte
and the ambient air. In low humidity environments, there can be
excessive water loss that can increase the electrolyte concentration
and eventually cause the cell to fail. In high humidity environments,
excessive water gain dilutes the electrolyte and can reduce the
electrochemical activity and eventually cause cell failure. Zinc air
batteries operate most effectively in the range of 0 (cid:3)Ce50 (cid:3)C. The

electrode substrate, a variety of carbon materials have been
investigated. Carbon black is widely considered as the most con-
ventional support. Carbon nanostructures such as 1D-nanotubes or
nanofibers and 2D-graphene nanosheets are also introduced due to
their efficient electron transport, structural integrity with the well-
dispersed catalyst, and facile diffusion of oxygen [110e112]. It is
also known that electrode kinetics is dependent on the degree of
site defect for the electrode materials. For example, structures with
large numbers of edge-plane sites such as pyrolytic graphite and
multi-walled carbon nanotubes exhibit high activity toward ORR
[113]. Furthermore, surface treatment or doping processes on car-
bon substrates can also improve their electrochemical behavior
[114e117]. In particular, for nitrogen doping on carbon, this dopant
can increase the degree of defect with more exposure of the edge
sites in graphitic carbon, highly influencing the stability and ac-
tivity of the ORR catalyst. Based on density functional theory (DFT)
calculations for high performance induced by doping, it has been
suggested that the edge sites of carbon can lower the barrier of
oxygen adsorption and electron transport [118].

Another approach to improve the electrochemical behavior of
Zn-air cell is the use of secondary oxygen evolution electrode which
effectively decouples the air electrode when the zinc-air battery is
charged. This has the advantage that standard air electrodes using
cheaper catalysts such as MnO2 can be used. The air electrode is
used for what it was designed for and optimized, and its lifetime is
not affected. Light oxygen evolution electrode was used made of a
metallic grid, which does not add any significant weight to the
battery.

Catalyst: The catalyst is an essential element in an air electrode.
It reduces oxygen reduction polarization for sluggish ORRs. For
potential catalysts, noble metals such as Pt and Pt-alloys have
played a role in contributing to high ORR activity. However, due to
the high cost of noble metals, a carbon-based catalyst has been
investigated [119e122]. In addition, the transition metal oxides
with various structures such as spinel and perovskite have also
been widely investigated for use as potential catalysts [123e126].
Among these candidates, Mn-based oxides of the thin-film type
produce an improved ORR activity, which is comparable to that of
the noble metal catalysts, but they exhibit low electrical conduc-
tivity and instability in alkaline solution, especially at 2 V, for the
oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during charging [127]. To over-
come these problems, the addition of nitrogen-doped carbon
nanotubes is introduced, which leads to 96% retention in the OER
current density after 50 cycles, as well as an increase in the elec-
trical conductivity [128].

3.2. Advanced redox flow battery

Although continuous attention has been paid to redox flow
batteries for stationary EES applications, their poor electrochemical
performances (low voltage and low energy density) have remained
one of the main challenges. To overcome this problem, the use of
advanced RFB systems has been researched, which is discussed in
this section.

Organic-Inorganic Aqueous System: The scalability and cost of
active materials are one of the main issues for their choice in EES
applications. For this reason, a metal-free organic-inorganic
aqueous flow battery system has recently been proposed [129]. This
system comprises 9,10-anthraquinone-2,7-disulfonic acid (AQDS)
in sulfuric acid as the negative electrode, Br2 in HBr as the positive
®
electrode, and a Nafion
carbon
paper. This battery system exhibits a relatively low open-circuit
potential of 0.92 V at a 90% state of charge. However, it shows not
only highly reversible electrochemical performance but also an
excellent galvanic discharge maintained at >99% over a long time

212 membrane between Toray

TM

(cid:2)2. These remarkable results are attributed to
scale, even at 0.5 A cm
the high reversibility of reactions involving the aromatic p-system
of AQDS, its high rate kinetic properties, and stability. Moreover, the
addition of a hydroxyl group to AQDS can increase cell voltage and
solubility as well as density [130]. Therefore, a metal-free flow
system can provide a low capital cost of storage chemicals per kWh,
with enhanced electrochemical performances, which is attractive
for cost-effective and large-scale energy storage applications.

Non-Aqueous System: Conventional aqueous-based RFB sys-
tems have a low energy density due to the small electrochemical
windows of the aqueous electrolytes and the low concentration of
redox species in the electrolytes. When the electrolytes have wider
electrochemical windows, there would be a greater choice of redox
couples, including high voltage redox couples and multi-electron
transfer redox species. This would be possible in non-aqueous
RFB (NRFB) systems [131]. The main difference between aqueous
and non-aqueous RFB systems is the electrolyte and the supporting
ions. In aqueous RFB, strong acids such as H2SO4 and HCl are used as
the electrolyte, and protons migrate across the membrane to
maintain electrical neutrality. In NRFB systems, an organic solvent
is utilized to dissolve redox species (metal-ligand complexes), and
ionic liquids are added to increase the ionic conductivity of the
electrolyte [132e134]. In general, NRFB systems exhibit higher
operating voltages (>2 V) than aqueous-based RFB. However, since
the solubility of redox species in a non-aqueous electrolyte is lower
(<0.1 M) than that of the aqueous-based electrolytes, the NRFB's
other electrochemical performances
capacity and
coulombic efficiency are not satisfactory even at low current den-
sity. To overcome these drawbacks of the NRFB system, many
research studies have been conducted. Two major approaches,
based on these studies, are discussed below.

such as

The first approach is to use a metal-ligand complex as the
electrolyte in NRFB. In a complex, metal takes part in a redox re-
action, and the ligand determines its solubility in the organic sol-
vent. Thus, if the combination of metal and ligand is well optimized,
it can provide a high operating voltage with sufficient solubility,
resulting in a higher energy density. Among various candidates, the
vanadium complex redox system has been widely studied
[135e137]. Single vanadium metal is coordinated with acetylacet-
onate (V(acac)3) in an electrolyte that consists of acetonitrile
(CH3CN) as the organic solvent and tetraethylammonium tetra-
fluoroborate (TEABF4) as the supporting electrolyte. Since the same
electrolytes are used in both electrodes in the above system, its
energy efficiency can be improved. The redox reaction is as follows
during an electrochemical reaction:

Overall reaction:

þ þ VII(acac)3

(cid:2)

The theoretical operating voltage is 2.18 V, which is ~60% higher
than that of aqueous vanadium RFBs that use 2 M H2SO4. If either of
the charged complexes migrates to the opposite electrode, this
cross-over can induce self-discharge by formation of a neutral in-
termediate, leading to a loss of charge-efficiency. It is not necessary
to regenerate the electrolyte solution in this battery system.
However, the levels of water and oxygen contamination are critical
for the battery's performance [137]. When the system contains

oxygen, the reduction ability of V(acac)3 is decreased, accompanied
by the degradation of the solvent and the supporting electrolyte.
Moreover, because V3þ
is easily converted to the double-bonded VO
species in water, V(acac)3 transforms to vanadyl acetylacetonate
(VO(acac)2), as shown in the following equation:

V(acac)3 þ H2O / VO(acac)2 þ Hacac þ H

(cid:2)
þ þ e

where Hacac is a protonated acetylacetonate. Therefore, the
membrane should be immersed in the electrolyte for a long time to
remove all water and oxygen before cell fabrication.

A redox-flow system using M(acac)3 (M 1⁄4 V, Cr or Mn, and
acac is acetylacetonate) with at least three different oxidation
states was also demonstrated by Thompson et al. [137]. The va-
nadium and chromium acetylacetonate systems showed higher
open-circuit potentials, 2.2 and 3.4 V, respectively, compared to
around 1.26 V for the aqueous VRB system. However, crossover
and ohmic losses, which is caused by the large distances between

positive and negative electrodes,
ciency. The Mn(acac)3 system exhibits better reversibility both
for Mn(II)/Mn(III) and Mn(III)/Mn(IV) redox couples with a
Columbic efficiency approaching 97%, although it shows a lower
open-circuit potential (1.1 V) than that of V(acac)3, Cr(acac)3, and
aqueous VRB.

The second approach to overcome the limitations of non-
aqueous system such as complex preparation and low solubility
of redox species is an all organic redox system [138]. This system
comprises 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (TEMPO) as the
catholyte, N-methylphthalimide as the anolyte, and NaClO4 as the
charge carrier dissolved in acetonitrile. For this system, the elec-
trochemical window is evaluated to be ~1.60 V, and the coulombic
efficiency (CE) is ~90% after 20 cycles. Another all-organic RFB is
also reported, which consists of 2,5-di-tert-butyl-1,4-bis(2-
methoxyethoxy) benzene (DBBB) as the catholyte,
the de-
rivatives from quinoxaline as the anolyte, and lithium salt in the
organic solvent as the electrolyte [139]. Both systems provide a
moderate voltage of <2.0 V, but the value still remains as limita-
tions including a solubility of active materials in the all-organic
system.

3.3. Aqueous lithium flow battery

Aqueous lithium batteries are promising alternatives for large-
scale applications which resolve several challenges of conven-
tional LIBs. The safety of flammable organic electrolytes is funda-
mentally resolved, the rigorous manufacturing conditions are
avoided, and the prices of the electrolyte solvent and salts are
relatively low, and the ionic conductivity of the aqueous electrolyte
is higher than those of organic electrolytes. In addition, they are
based on the environmental friendly, associating with the aqueous
electrolyte.

In the aqueous lithium battery, lithium is the most attractive
anode for batteries because Li metal has the highest specific charge
(cid:2)1), but the efficient utilization of Li is still the
capacity (3860 mAh g
main challenge to obtain a high energy density in the battery.
Instead of using oxygen as the cathode for the Li-air battery, the use
of water as the cathode in Li-water battery system has been also
considered. However, the Li-water battery is not rechargeable
because water loss occurs by the evolution of H2 and O2 during the
discharge and charge processes, respectively. Recently, an aqueous
Li-flow battery has been introduced, which uses water-soluble
redox couples in the positive electrode, as shown in Fig. 13
[140,141]. The electrochemical reactions are as described below
during discharge:

stored in a tank. To achieve high working voltages in a cell, it is
necessary to select high redox potentials for the positive electrode.
Possible candidates for the positive electrode are suggested in
Fig. 14 [140].

4(cid:2)

3(cid:2)

/Fe(CN)6

Among the various candidates of water-soluble redox species,
the Fe(CN)6
(aq) redox couple has been tested as the
cathode for the aqueous Li flow battery [142]. This battery system
uses a Li super ionic conductor ceramic as the solid-electrolyte,
which physically separates the anode part (containing Li metal
and non-aqueous liquid electrolyte) and the aqueous liquid cathode
containing 0.1 M K3Fe(CN)6, but allows Li-ion transportation be-
tween them. This configuration provides a working voltage of
(cid:2)2. Its cycle retention is
~3.40 V at a current density of 0.5 mA cm
maintained at 99% coulombic efficiency after 20 cycles, expecting a
good reversibility with high charge/discharge efficiency during
further cycles, due to an efficient flow-through mode. The battery
system offers two valuable properties, which is enhancement of Li
ion transport in solution and the absence of structural changes
during electrochemical reaction, allowing long term cycling.
However, the cell performance is limited by the use of the solid
electrolyte at high current density, which is attributed to a rela-
(cid:2)1) of the solid ceramic
tively low Li ion conductivity (1 (cid:4) 10
electrolyte compared to the mass transport rate of aqueous cathode
species.

(cid:2)4 S cm

The Fe3þ

/Fe2þ

(aq) redox couple in aqueous solutions has been
also investigated for its use as the cathode in aqueous Li flow bat-
tery systems [143]. This battery system has a working voltage of
(cid:2)2. However, the working
~3.35 V at a current density of 0.2 mA cm
voltage gradually drops to below 3 V at the end of the discharge,
because insufficient reduction of Fe3þ
occurs, which was caused by
the formation of b-FeOOH via slow hydrolysis of dilute FeCl3 by
aqueous species in the storage tank [144,145]. To overcome this
problem, HCl is added to adjust the acidity to an initial value
(pH 1⁄4 1.7) in the stock solution, and (NH4)2S2O8 is added as an
oxidizing agent to quickly and easily oxidize Fe2þ
, as in the
following reaction:

to Fe3þ

2 Fe2þ þ S2O8

2(cid:2)
2(cid:2) / 2 Fe3þ þ 2 SO4

As a result, the working voltage and capacity are significantly

improved.

The aqueous Li flow battery is promising for stationary EES
applications due to its high voltage and flexibility of a large-scale
design, but the selection of the solid-electrolyte remains as the
main key challenge. If the solid electrolyte possesses high con-
ductivity, stability, and scalability with a low cost, this system can
be more attractive for future large-scale EES applications.

3.4. Waste-Li-liquid flow battery

To respond to the requirement for a cost-effective system
(<$150/kWh), a new battery system, named the waste-Li-liquid
(WLL) flow battery, was recently proposed, as shown in Fig. 15
[146]. In this system, the Li metal is harvested from waste Li-ion
batteries, and the harvested Li metal (anode) is discharged with
the liquid solutions (cathodes) to produce electrical energy. In the
WLL battery system, the charged cathode and discharge cathode
sections are separated by a solid/liquid hybrid electrolyte to extend
the choices for electrode materials, including a liquid phase, a solid
phase, or a combination of both the liquid and solid phases. In the
charged cathode section, there are three options for supplying the
Li metal to the anode section: (a) using waste Li-ion battery ma-
terials containing Li ions such as the graphite anodeeLixC6, cath-
odes made of LixFePO4, or the organic liquid electrolyte, 1 M LiPF6 in
ethylene carbonate/diethylcarbonate (EC:DEC), (b) using the dis-
charged products such as LiOH (aq) created by discharging the
battery, or (c) simultaneously collecting Li from both sources. As for
the discharged cathode section, by using the harvested lithium
metal as the anode, water and other liquid solutions containing
aqueous, non-aqueous, and mixed solvents can be used as cathodes
to produce electrical energy.

It was reported that by using a hybrid electrolyte strategy, Li
metal was harvested by charging the liquid solutions containing
waste Li-ion battery materials, and the harvested Li metal was

used as the cathodes for the WLL battery system, and their voltage
versus Li metal can be tuned by combining various solvents, solutes,
redox couples, and counter anions.

The cell performances can be limited by the low Li-ion con-
ductivity of the solid electrolyte. Li1þxþyTi2(cid:2)xAlxP3(cid:2)ySiyO12 is a
commercially available solid electrolyte that provides Li-ion con-
(cid:2)1 [146]. Further development of
ductivity in the range of 10
solid electrolytes is required not only for WLL battery systems but
Li-liquid
also for other batteries
[140,142,143,148,149], and Li-air [150e152]. When using the Li

[147],

metal as the anode, the formation of Li dendrite and its chemical
instability has been an issue, which causes safety problems in
battery systems. To address this point, the Li metal anode in WLL
batteries can be replaced by Li intercalation compounds such as
graphite and Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) [153]. When LTO is adapted as the
anode in the WLL battery, the working voltage is relatively low at
~1.8 V, but it exhibits good cycle retention, with 91.2% Coulombic
efficiency. The low operation voltage is due to the LTO's high
oxidation potential of ~1.5 V vs. Li, which eliminates the possibility
the
of decomposition of

the organic electrolyte. Therefore,

electrochemical properties such as cycle ability and efficiency will
be improved by prevention of the electrolyte decomposition, which
occur undesired reaction on the surface of anode.

The proposed WLL battery system enables the harvesting of Li
metal on the surface of anode part from waste LIBs at room tem-
perature and produces electricity, by using the harvested Li metal
as the anode and the liquid solution as the cathode. In addition,
those particular liquid chemistries to be used as cathodes, which
were found to be most effective (higher discharge voltage at higher
current rate) for the proposed battery system, can be selected from
various combinations of solvents, redox couples, and counter an-
ions. Furthermore, if these types of batteries are to be successful, in
terms of using liquid state as cathodes, one should eliminate the
complicated, expensive solid electrode manufacture processes that
are required when using solid state materials as electrodes for LIBs.
Hence, the use of battery waste as electrode could have cost
effective and could easily make its entry into the large-scale battery
market for stationary electrical energy storage devices. The scale-
up for EES be challenging but, along with the fundamental
studies on liquid solutions as cathodes, the results of the other
studies on the WLL battery system (including the solid electrolyte,
the cell components, overall system design, and the battery pro-
totype) are expected to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Waste-
Li-Liquid (WLL) flow battery for stationary energy storage
applications.

4. Conclusions

A clean and renewable energy system that is completely inde-
pendent of fossil fuels may not be possible within 20 or 30 years,
but society must move in this direction in order for future gener-
ations to inherit a cleaner Earth. Achieving successful stationary
EES technology is essential for a renewable energy system. Among
the many candidates for EES system, batteries are attractive tech-
nology because they are more suitable in terms of their applica-
bility at various geographical locations, power and energy density,
efficiency, weight, and mobility of the systems. To commercialize
batteries in the stationary EES market, the key parameter is the
capital cost, which is defined as the cost per unit energy divided by
the cycle life. Additionally, the long cycle performance of the bat-
tery is another key parameter for successful EES applications. The
required EES parameters for many types of battery systems are
summarized in Table 2. Unfortunately, there is no single battery
technology that meets all the EES requirements. There always exists
trade-off between one parameter and another. Hence, detailed
analysis of the candidates should be carried out to select an
appropriate energy storage system in terms of mature technologies,
lifetime, cost, energy density, and cycle efficiency.

The appropriate selection of batteries for EES applications can be
mainly determined by the scale. For example, LIB is suitable for

small-sized EES applications such as mobile phones, while RFB are
more appropriate for large-scale applications. The Department of
Energy (DOE), USA, has reported the cost and performance targets
for near-term and long-term EES systems for large-scale electricity
applications [154]. In the near term, the developed battery tech-
nologies such as RFB, NaeS, leadecarbon, and LIB need to be further
developed with a capital cost of <$250/kWh and system efficiency
of >75%. In the long term, the new battery technologies based on
advanced systems and materials are required to be developed with
the cost of <$150/kWh and efficiency of >80%. Also, the abundance
of the electroactive materials used in batteries is another key factor
for its application in stationary EES systems. For example, when
considering the present estimate of the global extractable Li
reserve, the amount of Li may be enough to produce LIB for electric
vehicles [155]. However, when LIB starts to be applied in stationary
EES systems, tremendous amounts of Li resources will be required,
which will make the LIB less available. Furthermore, it is essential
to understand and identify the electronic and chemical properties
of the electroactive materials and their effects on the battery per-
formances for utilizing batteries in stationary EES applications.

In conclusion, large-scale batteries have been gradually imple-
mented in the stationary EES application field. However, the
increased use of the batteries in the EES system is limited owing to
their high costs and unsatisfactory electrochemical performances. If
new battery systems or further developments of present battery
systems can be introduced with suitable characteristics for large-
scale EES systems,
it will bring society one step closer to
achieving successful stationary energy storage technology for use
in renewable energy systems.
