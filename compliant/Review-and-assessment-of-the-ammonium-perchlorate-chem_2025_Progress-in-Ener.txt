Physical and chemical processes of ammonium perchlorate and hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (AP/HTPB)
composite propellant combustion have been studied for several decades, and more than 50 years of model
development can be reported. Computational methods focus on the heterogeneous aspects—the solid-phase and
its decomposition—whereas AP self-deflagration and burning characteristics should be seen as a multi-step,
physiochemical process. There has been a lack of systematic studies on the gas-phase chemical kinetics mech-
anisms for AP combustion, with emphasis on the starting gas-phase species NH3 and HClO4. Only three recent
detailed gas-phase mechanisms with sufficient detail in terms of the number of chemical reactions and number of
species are currently available in the literature prior to 2023, and simulations are carried out within the present
review to assess the state of their current performance and to highlight potential knowledge gaps that should be
filled. Given the importance and prevalence of AP in modern propellants, it is surprising that the chemical ki-
netics of AP combustion are very much understudied. The authors highlight the fact that the few existing AP
mechanisms have never been fully vetted against an applicable database of experimental results, certainly not in
the manner that mechanisms are typically validated within the combustion science community for fuels such as
hydrogen and various hydrocarbons. This review does not put forward such a mechanism, but rather 1) brings to
light the limitations of current AP kinetics mechanisms in predicting some limited, available kinetics data, and 2)
underlines the need for additional, fundamental data that can be used to calibrate an AP kinetics model. A
limited gas-phase experimental database was identified from currently available sources for two main compound
families: ammonia (NH3) and perchloric acid (HClO4). The decomposition of AP is initiated by NH4ClO4 → NH3
+ HClO4 and leads to these two rather complex molecules that differ strongly in their nature and consequently in
their reaction schemes for combustion processes. On the one hand, existing measurements of ignition delay
times, laminar flame speeds, and speciation were collected for NH3, N2O, and NO2, and on the other hand, a
similar albeit much smaller body of experimental results was assembled for HClO4, ClO2, and Cl2. These global
kinetics data were used to evaluate modern AP/HTPB propellant models. We observe that there is much room for
improvement regarding models’ performance. Significant improvements in our ability to model the gas-phase
chemical kinetics of AP combustion can be made by taking advantage of recent developments in ammonia
oxidation chemistry modeling. However, additional, fundamental data are needed before similar strengthening
of the perchlorate-related chemical kinetics as well as for cross-system reactions involving both N- and Cl-based
species can be made.

1. Introduction

AP/HTPB (ammonium perchlorate/hydroxyl-terminated

poly-
butadiene) is a composite propellant used in aerospace propulsion ap-
plications, such as solid propellants for rockets. Both fuel and oxidizer
are mixed together homogeneously, where AP serves as the oxidizer and
HTPB plays the roles of both binder and fuel [1]. The distribution of the
AP particles in the propellant is of importance for the burning process, as
the AP is the dominant source that tailors the final strength of the
monopropellant [2]. Multimodal propellants are more challenging to
comprehend, as different rates can be initiated by the particles,
increasing the complexity of the flame interactions [3]. Therefore, the
appropriate loading of propellant grains ensures the required burning
characteristics of AP/HTPB for military and other purposes. Fig. 1 il-
lustrates the chemical structures of the main propellant ingredients, AP
and HTPB.

1.1. Background

While AP/HTPB is currently the most widely used propellant com-
bination, its combustion processes are not fully understood and are
difficult to model over a wide range of conditions. This situation is due
to the rather complicated, heterogeneous nature of AP-based composite
propellant combustion, and research is ongoing in the propellant com-
munity to better understand its overall combustion behavior and to
develop robust models. Predictive models that can accurately reproduce
the complicated combustion process of a solid propellant are valuable

bustion process that in turn can be used for the development of advanced
additives and new propellant formulations.

As can be seen in the study of Dennis and Bojko, five important steps
characterize AP/HTPB propellant combustion [1]. First, it begins with
the dissociative sublimation of the AP complex, spreading through a
solid-to-gas phase, named AP “melting layer”, obtained by the endo-
thermic decomposition of the solid oxidizer. Similarly, the HTPB poly-
mer also decomposes (Step 1). Exothermic, condensed-phase reactions
driven by the AP decomposition products follow (Step 2). Then, the
gases produced by the condensed-phase reactions react exothermically
in the “AP monopropellant flame” (Step 3). Interactions at the bind-
er/oxidizer boundaries form the fuel-oxidant “primary diffusion flame”
(Step 4). Lastly, the “final diffusion flame” represents the reactions be-
tween the product gases of the “AP monopropellant flame”, the “primary
diffusion flame”, and any remaining fuel pyrolysis products (Step 5). The
basic heterogeneous composition and resulting flame zones are illus-
trated in Fig. 2.

Of primary importance to the study of AP-based composite propel-
lant combustion is the prediction of a formulation’s overall burning rate,
in mm/s, which represents the regression velocity of the solid-propellant
surface during burning. Numerous studies are available on the empirical
measurement of burning rates for various formulations of ingredients
and also on the theoretical and numerical modeling of the heteroge-
neous combustion zone. However, the present review focuses only on
the gas-phase combustion chemistry, which arguably plays a key role
within several of the burning regimes shown in Fig. 2 but alone does not

necessarily dictate the overall burning rate of the propellant. The
chemical kinetics of AP combustion in particular can be considered a
sub-model within a larger analysis of the flame zone. A brief summary
follows, to provide context for the AP chemical kinetics and references
for the interested reader on the other aspects of AP-based propellant
combustion.

The physical and chemical processes of AP/HTPB composite pro-
pellant combustion have been studied over the years, and modeling
approaches can be found in the literature. Typical computational
methods focus on the heterogeneous aspects related to the solid phase
and its decomposition, whereas AP self-deflagration and burning char-
acteristics should be seen as a multi-step, physico-chemical process. As
shown in this paper, there have been very few systematic studies on the
gas-phase mechanisms and on condensed-phase reactions of AP. For the
purposes of the present review paper, the decomposition of ammonium
perchlorate is initiated by R1 and leads to two main compounds:
ammonia and perchloric acid [1,4,5].

however that many of the available AP models were indeed designed
with the latter perspective in mind, so they may not have all the
predictive capability expected in a detailed mechanism.)

2. Assess current AP gas-phase mechanisms and their sub-mechanisms
against fundamental data and contrast them with modern developments
from the combustion kinetics community. Emphasis is placed on the
ammonia sub-mechanism in light of recent progress both in
modeling and in the available experimental database, which is in
stark contrast to the current deficiencies in available data and
modeling for the perchloric acid sub-mechanism and for an overall
AP kinetics database.

3. Uncover strengths and weaknesses in AP chemical kinetics modeling to
date and to present a methodology for developing a robust, comprehensive
mechanism in the near future. A comprehensive AP kinetics mecha-
nism is perhaps the overarching, ultimate goal of this work, although
achievement of this goal is beyond the scope of this review paper.
This paper should serve as a good starting point toward that goal.

These molecules are rather complex and differ strongly by two
chemical elements, nitrogen and chlorine, subsequently impacting their
reaction schemes. Throughout this review paper, we hence divide the
discussion of the AP chemical kinetics on the basis of these two sys-
tems—one based on nitrogen chemistry through ammonia, and one
based on hydrogen-chlorine chemistry through perchloric acid. Note,
however,
this paper is on the ammonium
perchlorate combustion chemistry and therefore is not intended to be a
comprehensive review of HTPB-related chemical kinetics. Such a study
on HTPB and the resulting interactions between hydrocarbons and the
NH3/HClO4 systems, ultimately toward an overall model of AP/HTPB
propellant combustion chemistry,
is more suitable for a separate,
comprehensive study of its own. Arguably, the combustion kinetics of
hydrocarbons such as butadiene are much further developed due to the
interest in such fuels by the larger combustion community.

1.2. Motivation and objectives

Given the importance of AP in modern rocket propellants and en-
ergetic materials, accurate insight into AP chemical kinetics and its role
in propellant combustion is crucial for fully understanding and pre-
dicting propellant burning behavior. A primary motivation for this re-
view paper is the community’s need for a detailed AP chemical kinetics
mechanism. Ideally, a robust, comprehensive mechanism will give
insight into AP gas-phase chemistry over a wide range of temperatures,
pressures, and mixture compositions. From this reliable, detailed
mechanism, one can then derive various intermediate and reduced
mechanisms for use in comprehensive, physical models of the compli-
cated combustion processes in an AP-containing composite propellant. A
secondary motivation for this review paper is to bring to light an
apparent disconnect between the development of currently available AP
kinetics models and the development of modern, detailed kinetics
models in the fuel combustion community. By doing so, we hope to
demonstrate an approach for mastering the problem of AP kinetics by
using fundamental kinetics data (most of which are not currently
available) and methodology that has been refined for common fuels such
as methane, hydrogen, and various hydrocarbons.

This review paper therefore has three main objectives.

1. Perform a review of the current state of the art of AP chemical kinetics
this review is from the perspective of a
modeling. Note that
comprehensive, detailed kinetics modeling approach with a focus on
just the chemistry, rather than an AP kinetics model that is designed
as part of a model for predicting physical parameters such as burning
rate, which arguably involve additional physics such as heat transfer,
transport phenomena, and bulk fluid mechanics. (We realize

This paper is organized as follows: a summary of available gas-phase
AP chemical kinetics models is first provided. Then, a meaningful gas-
phase experimental database is collected for AP constituents. Suitable
measurements for the tuning of chemical kinetics mechanisms include
ignition delay times, laminar flame speeds, and species concentrations.
Such data were assembled from the literature for NH3, N2O, and NO2;
analogously, a similar body of experimental results was compiled for
HClO4, ClO2, and Cl2. Therefore, not only the direct constituents NH3
and HClO4 are considered, but the major intermediate species as well,
which is common for the comprehensive validation of detailed chemical
kinetics models. The resulting database is focused on global kinetics data
that are useful to tune the reactivity of models and are used herein to
evaluate the accuracy of existing AP chemical kinetics models. Note that
most of these kinetics models were originally designed as an integral
part of larger, comprehensive, multi-physics models of composite pro-
pellant burning. The goal of these larger models typically was the pre-
diction of burning rate, which in itself is not a very precise metric for
evaluating the detailed gas-phase chemistry behavior and the accuracy
of a kinetics mechanism. Hence, it is not surprising that comparing the
predictions of existing AP mechanisms to the available kinetics data-
base, as we do herein, leads to large differences between experiments
and models. Finally, the last section presents and discusses the findings
from this study with respect to the various sub-mechanism chemistries
and suggests future research directions for obtaining an improved AP
chemical kinetics model.

2. Fundamentals: mechanisms and database

Provided in this section are summaries on AP chemical kinetics
modeling and related experimental kinetics data. In the first section, the
history of AP kinetics modeling is presented, leading to a short list of the
models on which a large part of the paper is based, Sections 3 and 4
specifically. In the second half of this section, available literature data-
—from the standpoint of fundamental kinetics model validation for the
ammonia and perchloric acid sub-mechanisms—are summarized and
discussed. As further elaborated upon, target kinetics data are those that
can be used to validate only (or primarily) the combustion chemistry.
These types of data tend to come from canonical experiments with very
well-controlled environments. Nevertheless, such experiments and the
data therefrom are commonplace in the combustion kinetics community
but have arguably been underutilized or are lacking entirely when
developing AP kinetics mechanisms for the prediction of composite
propellant burning rates.

2.1. AP/HTPB gas-phase chemical kinetics models

2.1.1. Chronological modeling work

A very recent detailed review of the AP/HTPB gas-phase chemical
kinetics models has been performed by Dennis and Bojko [1]. In their
review, recommendations on future research were provided based on
their assessment of the state of the art. They concluded that the com-
bustion of ammonium perchlorate (AP) and hydroxyl-terminated poly-
butadiene (HTPB) composite propellant is a multiphase process, and
experimental data are required to refine computational models, espe-
cially in the condensed phase. However, the emphasis of the Dennis and
Bojko review paper was on understanding and predicting the overall
composite propellant burning behavior and not necessarily on the
comprehensive validation of the detailed reaction chemistry. Certainly,
the primary goal should be predicting AP/HTPB burning behavior, but
validation of the gas-phase kinetics should be done separately and in a
thorough manner, as has been done for hydrogen, methane, and other
fuels. Global metrics of reactivity such as ignition delay times and
laminar flame speeds are examples of preferred data for mechanism
validation. Species concentrations at reduced and elevated pressures
will also be extremely useful, and novel diagnostics are needed for HNO,
HCl, and ClO2, among others. The authors strongly believe that such
species play important roles in modeling AP combustion chemistry, as
seen later in this paper. Table SM1 in the Supplementary Material pre-
sents a chronological summary of the modeling work on AP/HTPB
gas-phase chemistry to date [4,6–56].

There is a large number of studies developing modeling approaches
for AP/HTPB composite propellants that present very distinct tech-
niques, widely varying from statistical models, Petite Ensemble Model
(PEM), Finite Element Method (FEM), Monte Carlo simulation, quantum
chemical prediction, classical phase-field theory, and ray-tracing algo-
rithms, to cite only a few. These existing models regroup both condensed
and gas-phase regions and are absolutely valuable for obtaining burning
rates from the overall, heterogeneous problem. Nonetheless, studies
encompassing a chemical kinetics reaction mechanism that crucially
attempt to describe the relevant elementary steps during the combustion
process of the AP/HTPB are limited. With a reasonable number of re-
actions and species, a list of elementary reaction equations is defined
with rate coefficient parameters A, b, and Ea, and can be calibrated
based on standard procedures developed within the larger combustion
kinetics community over the last four decades. The reaction rate co-
efficients are written under the form of the modified Arrhenius equation
as follows

k = ATb exp((cid:0) Ea / RT)

(Eq. 1)

5

In this expression, Ea is the activation energy (J/mol or cal/mol), T is the
temperature (K), R is the universal ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol-K),
and A and b are empirical fitting constants. The constants in Eq. (1) are
typically obtained from direct measurements or theoretical calculations
available in the literature, and a detailed mechanism will often have a
combination of both types of rate coefficients over the many dozens of
possible elementary reactions. When the reaction rate constants are not
known from measurement or theory, they are often estimated based on
certain rules, when appropriate, or are adjusted to fit experimental data.
Ultimately, mechanisms are evaluated using fundamental data
available from the literature, as mentioned previously. In most cases, for
common systems such as H2 and CH4, the mechanisms are continuously
improved over a period of many years and is often a community-wide
effort involving dozens of datasets of various types by many different
researchers [57,58]. In the present paper, we analyze the state of AP
chemical kinetics with this historical approach taken by the larger
combustion community in mind.

2.1.2. Selection of the gas-phase mechanisms

From Table SM1 (see Supplementary Material), it was possible to
characterize a chronological framework of the gas-phase mechanism
development, which is presented as Fig. 3. Three recent models with a
sizeable number of chemical reactions and species as to be considered
comprehensive are visible. First, the Giovangigli et al. model [37], based
on the Guirao and Williams efforts [8] and developed in collaboration
with the Smooke et al. [31] work, consists of 215 reactions and 37
species. Second, the Gross model [39], based on the Beckstead et al.
endeavors [7,12,13], contains 127 reactions and 37 species. Third, the
Chen and McQuaid model [50], a reduced version of McQuaid and Chen
(2014) [48], has 100 reactions and 81 species. Guirao and Williams have
also inspired the research group from the Indian Institute of Science with
work from Narahari et al. in 1985 [21], but very rapidly, in 1990, Sahu
et al. [23] presented their last mechanism version with 22 reactions and
18 species. Note that the models in Fig. 3 are for AP and HTPB kinetics,
although the present paper focuses primarily on their ability to predict
AP combustion chemistry, as aforementioned.

Overall, two main families of mechanisms can be observed: (i) a
collaborative effort from Yale University, Princeton University, the
Naval Air Warfare Center, Pennsylvania State University, Ecole Poly-
technique, and French Aerospace Laboratory; and (ii) a Lockheed Pro-
pulsion Company and Brigham Young University (BYU) collaboration.
Both families have incorporated the detailed kinetics reaction rate
constants from the Russian Academy of Sciences for gas reactions.
Nevertheless, the last versions of their mechanism remain distinctly
different, e.g. 215 versus 127 reactions (this point is further clarified in

C.M. Gr ́egoire et al.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 106 (2025) 101195

Sections 3 and 4). It is important to point out that the Chen and McQuaid
work was performed by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL), but
very little to no information about their model development is available
in the open literature.

In this paper, only the three most-recent mechanisms (the Gio-
vangigli et al. [37], Gross [39], and Chen and McQuaid [50] models) are
used, and it is important to note that each of these mechanisms has been
somewhat reduced from larger detailed kinetics mechanisms. Since the
AP/HTPB composite propellant is used for solid rocket propulsion for
modern-day missiles [59], and much of the military-critical technical,
sensitive, and classified data are not openly shared in the literature, our
work followed the three main objectives presented in Section 1.2. Some
additional details regarding the model development for the 3 main
mechanisms utilized herein are provided as follows.

The Gross model was first developed by Beckstead et al. [60] at BYU
and is based on the nitramine chemistry of RDX (cyclonite) from Yetter
et al. [61] and then was combined with GRIMech 3.0 for methane
combustion [62], the Miller et al. mechanism for nitroglycerine com-
bustion [63], and other sources [39]. Collaboration with Lin’s Chemical
Kinetics Research Group [41] at Emory University provided ab initio
calculations of kinetic pathways for propellant combustion. Note that no
modification was permitted on the reaction parameters, so that the
gas-phase mechanism remains theoretically based. The hope was to
obtain accurate numerical predictions to limit the amount of experi-
ments in many critical conditions. Moreover, the objective was also to
use this updated version of the AP model to develop a two-dimensional
to examine the flame structure above an
diffusion flame model
AP/HTPB composite propellant. The transport equations using the
Navier-Stokes equations were replaced with a vorticity formulation for a
more stable and faster solution. The particle size, pressure, and
composition effects on the flame structure were observed and were
found consistent with experiments. Gross mentioned that experimental
data for the temperature and species profiles are not often available, but

when possible, give a more comprehensive validation of the model. The
model was validated against AP/HTPB propellant with different particle
size for AP from 12 μm to 400 μm, and the calculated results agreed
qualitatively with the BDP model, and were consistent with experi-
mentally observed trends. A range of pressure from 1 to 100 atm was
tested, and an inverted “S” shaped curve is calculated at pressures
greater than 1 atm. However, the final temperature and species are still
slightly off, and these deficiencies are attributed to the chlorine-nitrogen
chemistry of the gas-phase mechanism. Gross suggested that work was
still necessary to address this shortcoming in future detailed kinetic
studies.

Secondly, the Giovangigli et al. mechanism combined GRIMech
version 2.11 [64] with the AP mechanisms reported in Refs. [18,26,65]
and the nitrogen-chlorine sub-mechanisms from Refs. [66,67]. The
model was used to understand the effects of solid propellant heteroge-
neity on combustion zone microstructure as well as the location and the
structure of the heat release zones that control the propellant ballistic
properties. A series of experimental measurements were compared with
this model; it consists of the temperature measured with OH rotational
population distribution, and the transient species OH, CN, and NH
measured using PLIF and emission spectroscopy. While good results
were observed, the differences were attributed to several approxima-
tions in the model, e.g., the surface decomposition of AP is defined only
with the surface products, and the laser-heated surface experiments may
not adequately describe the pressure of 0.92 atm.

Thirdly, Chen and McQuaid started their effort in 2012 and found
that the finite-rate chemical kinetics mechanisms currently available for
gas-phase AP chemistry were questionably parametrized for sensitive
reactions. The development of the mechanism in Ref. [50] with updated
combustion of HTPB (R45 polymer) in a NOx-rich environment [68,69]
has the reaction-rate expressions and thermochemical property esti-
mates reviewed in Ref. [70], whereas the AP chemistry is from BYU. The
deflagration of AP/HTPB was of interest, as was the underlying mech-
anism of
the burning
rate-versus-pressure ballistics curve. Atwood et al. showed that this
phenomenon typically occurs around 3000 psi (200 bar) [71] and is
referred to as an “exponent break”, limiting the performance potential of
this propellant [72].

Initially designed for inclusion in burning rate models, the use of the
reduced versions instead of otherwise detailed mechanisms should not
prevent their usage for gas-phase purposes because post-reduction
analysis was carefully carried out to not disqualify them by their
research groups. Moreover, it was observed that the Giovangigli et al.
[37] model contains 215 reactions that are all dedicated to AP com-
bustion alone. The Gross model [39] includes 127 reactions, and 78 of
them are dedicated to AP chemistry. Lastly, Chen and McQuaid [50]
allocated 59% of their reduced model to focus on AP. For comparison, an
ammonia combustion-related mechanism from Mathieu and Petersen
[73] (more details on this model and others are discussed in the Results
section as well), has a total of 278 reactions, with 159 of them for NH3
sub-mechanisms. When the initial/full mechanisms started with 2627
(McQuaid and Chen [48]), 506 (Smooke et al. [31]), and perhaps 611
reactions for Gross [39], we can suppose that the reduction was per-
formed mostly on the HTPB portion and that the intent of the

It should also be mentioned that it is purely a model-availability
limitation that led the authors to select these three models for the
comparisons to follow. These models were also, in large part, not vali-
dated against the types of data to which they are compared in this paper
in the following sections. This situation is partly because much of those
data did not exist at the time the mechanisms were originally assembled.
Nonetheless, the point of this paper is to bring to light the need for a
stringent validation plan for developing a comprehensive AP chemical
kinetics mechanism, and showing where the models are lacking is a good
starting place.

Additionally, these three models can arguably still be considered as
being of moderate-to-large size, such that adding a few key reactions or
species that are otherwise absent would not have greatly increased their
practical size. Thus, the authors believe that the comparisons made to
the available, detailed data in the remainder of this paper are appro-
priate. Of course, the results should not reflect negatively on the work
supporting the three models. They are each of major importance, but, as
shown in the present review paper, more work is needed to further
develop AP kinetics models by continuous validation against appro-
priate,
fundamental kinetics data as they become available. The
currently available database for such validation is summarized in the
following subsection.

2.2. Compilation of a relevant experimental database

The experimental measurements available within AP/HTPB-related
studies in a burning propellant environment are reported in Table 1
and represent a variety of diagnostics, such as Mass Spectrometry (MS),
Planar Laser-Induced Fluorescence (PLIF), Emission Spectroscopy (ES),
and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR). Detailed measurements such as
these are useful for the calibration of burning-rate and multi-physics
models of AP/HTPB combustion in general. A detailed chemical ki-
netics model that is well validated over a similar range of conditions
(pressures,
temperatures, stoichiometry, etc.) will contribute to a
multidimensional model’s ability to reproduce such laboratory data. In
the present context, a well-validated kinetics mechanism is one that uses
rate coefficients that have been validated against global kinetics data
involving many reactions.

However, some of the types of data from experiments and methods
such as those in Table 1 should arguably not be used as a first step to
validate the gas-phase chemistry due to the complexity of the combus-
tion environment. That is, while the goal should ultimately be a model,
containing both physical and chemical aspects, that can accurately
reproduce data such as those in Table 1, such data should (ideally) not
be used to fine tune the chemical kinetics portion alone or at least when
assembling an initial, core mechanism. Ideally, a detailed chemical ki-
netics model should first be validated separately against fundamental
kinetics data; it will then be more reliable when integrated into the
thermal-fluid aspects of a complete model (even if the detailed model
required some reduction in size, for computational constraints).

It is, therefore, preferable to instead carry out targeted experiments
to develop and improve the detailed kinetics models using known
techniques within the combustion kinetics field. However, it is impor-
tant to mention that there is currently no such fundamental study for AP
or HTPB combustion chemistry. Thus, the authors resorted to compiling
data and comparing models for individual components of the composite
propellant of interest, such as NH3 and HClO4 for AP, as seen later. While

NO2, HClO4, ClO2, and Cl2 from 1965 to 2022 (exponential increase of NH3
studies in 2023). The ammonia-related studies are limited to pure-NH3 systems
only; there are many more studies of NH3 blends with other fuels.

this approach is not totally satisfactory to thoroughly assess AP/HTPB
kinetic mechanisms, it is however convenient (and necessary) to assess
the different (i.e., two) primary sub-mechanisms involved in the AP/
HTPB combustion chemistry. It is necessary since sub-mechanisms
within a full, detailed mechanism should be able to reproduce an
array of fundamental data involving the various species in the sub-
mechanisms.

To compile a dataset that could be better used to validate the AP
kinetics mechanism, the authors conducted a survey of the literature for
fundamental kinetics data typical of what are commonly used for cali-
brating kinetics mechanisms in the combustion field. This gas-phase
database of experimental validation results was assembled from the
limited sources available for related molecules. This database is used
herein to evaluate the gas-phase chemical kinetics sub-mechanisms of
the AP models presented above (again, there are no experimental data
available to assess the full AP combustion chemistry model yet). This
step is necessary to assess the accuracy of (and validate) the chemistry of
AP models in the same manner that detailed kinetics models of common
fuels are extensively validated. Some examples are given shortly. Several
types of experiments are typically used for this purpose, such as 1)
ignition delay times, 2) shock-tube species time histories, 3) laminar
flame speeds, 4) jet-stirred reactor speciation, 5) flame species profiles,
and 6) flow-tube speciation.

As mentioned above, well-validated, detailed kinetics mechanisms
have their performance extensively tested; for example, AramcoMech
1.3 [80] has been validated against a large array of experimental mea-
surements, where data from shock tubes, rapid compression machines,
flames,
jet-stirred and plug-flow reactors were included. While
continuing their development efforts, the same procedure was used for
AramcoMech 2.0 [57], AramcoMech 3.0 [81], and NUIMECH 1.1 [82].
Similarly, GRIMech 2.11 added 102 nitrogen-chemistry-relevant re-
actions in their previous version GRIMech 1.2 [64] to reach a total of
277 reactions. After further optimization using ignition delay times,
species profiles in a shock tube, laminar flame speeds, laminar flame
species profiles, flow reactor experiments, and stirred reactor mea-
surements, GRIMech 3.0 was validated to model NO formation and
reburning chemistry, compiling a final reaction number of 325 [62].
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) has worked on
numerous compounds, and they have also calibrated chemical kinetics
mechanisms with a similar methodology. For instance, n-heptane has
been numerically investigated and updated more than once over the past
25 years [83–86]. Model validation included combining experiments in
shock tubes and rapid compression machines [84], covering experi-
mental pressures from 3 to 50 atm, temperatures from 650 to 1200 K,
and equivalence ratios from 0.3 to 1.0.

Ignition delay times, laminar flame speeds, and species time histories
constitute useful data for improving chemical kinetics mechanism ac-
curacy and increasing their reliability. The ignition delay time (or IDT) is
a key, fundamental combustion characteristic, and this parameter can be
measured in a shock tube (or rapid compression machine, RCM) with
many experimental diagnostics. One of the most common techniques to
obtain the ignition delay time is to measure the OH* chemiluminescence
emission during combustion under both diluted and undiluted condi-
tions. When models do not include this chemistry, a very common set of
10 reactions associated with OH* can be implemented. For our modeling
purposes, the OH* chemistry was added to each AP/HTPB model, using
the chemistry proposed in Hall and Petersen [87] and as updated in
Mathieu and Petersen for NH3 oxidation [73].

Laminar flame speed is another very important property of a
combustible mixture because it provides chemical information about the
mixture’s diffusivity, chemical reactivity, and exothermicity. In funda-
mental combustion, it is used for the validation of chemical kinetics
mechanisms and in their development, in conjunction with ignition
delay times and species time histories. Donohoe et al. is a good repre-
sentation of the combination of ignition delay times with laminar flame
speeds to validate mechanisms; in this case, for natural gas/hydrogen

blends at elevated pressures [88].

A meaningful gas-phase experimental database was assembled for
the two main compound families: ammonia (NH3) and perchloric acid
(HClO4). Measurements of ignition delay times, laminar flame speeds,
and speciation were collected for NH3, N2O, and NO2, for the ammonia
family, and a similar albeit smaller body of experimental results was
found for HClO4, ClO2, and Cl2 for the perchloric acid family. The lack of
studies for the perchloric acid compounds and their major intermediates
was discovered, as can be seen in Fig. 4, where, compared to NH3, N2O,
and NO2, only 20% of studies report on HClO4 and its intermediate
species. Simulations using each of the three kinetics models selected
were performed for these datasets to evaluate their performance. With
an eye toward eventual model improvement, the procedure used herein
highlights several opportunities for improving the reaction mechanisms.
However, it is not the intent of the present work to provide such an
updated model, as discussed in more detail later in this paper. As a
minimum, the results in this subsection provide a framework for sys-
tematically assessing the performance of the models as new experi-
mental data and reaction rate evaluations become available.

It is well accepted in the scientific literature [89,90] that charge
transport is the initial step in AP decomposition. These processes are the
condensed-phase reactions mentioned within this manuscript. The
process is believed to be initiated by proton transfer from the ammo-
nium ion to the perchlorate ion. In addition to the charge transfer,
Politzer and Lane [91] suggested that an intermediate complex on the
surface may exist based upon reaction energetics. Still, the calculations
in that work indicate the formation of NH3 and HClO4. Desorption re-
actions of NH3 and HClO4 are likely the next steps. Direct observations of
NH3 and HClO4 are noted by Boldyrev. Brill et al. [92] observed HClO4
and intermediates of NH3 oxidation (no NH3 directly) early in fast
heating rate experiments. Those authors postulated that the positive
oxygen balance of AP enabled NH3 to be oxidized relatively quickly and
resulted in remaining HClO4. The kinetics of the adsorption/desorption
reactions, to our knowledge, are not well-known or available.

The products of this reaction are NH3 and HClO4 which subsequently
gasify. The current state-of-the-art suggests these two molecules are the
primary gas-phase species from the AP surface. With that being said,
experimental evidence indicates that intermediate species (e.g., NH,
NH2, NOx) related to the oxidation of NH3 are present near the surface as
well [92]. Even if NH3, for example, is not present or at least very
short-lived, the NH3 oxidation mechanism will still contain appropriate
species and potential chemical pathways. A detailed chemical kinetics
mechanism that contains all related, intermediate species and appro-
priately updated elementary reactions should be flexible enough to
model the AP flame if, for example, future studies reveal that species
other than or in addition to NH3 and HClO4 are the initial gas-phase
decomposition species of AP.

There are numerous comprehensive reviews on the condensed-phase
reactions (e.g., Boldyrev, Jacobs and Whitehead), but that portion is
beyond the scope of the current review which focuses on the gas-phase.
As noted in the prior paragraphs, the previous evidence suggests NH3
and HClO4 as primary gases. There is evidence that the solid-phase
chemistry of AP is not a rate-limited step, although one could argue
that at very high pressure it may be limiting. Previous work observed
that different formulations reach the same burning rate in the high-
pressure limit (for the experiments) [93] and were believed to be due
to an ‘AP barrier’ as mentioned in the literature [72]. Pressures more
commonly used for solid rocket motors (≈6–7 MPa) are below those
high-pressure conditions, and the limiting step may be different. For
example, large AP in propellants is observed to burn faster than neigh-
boring binder mixtures [94]. In that scenario, it is unlikely the AP
decomposition kinetics are limiting.

Heterogeneous reactions have not received much attention to the
best of our knowledge aside from low-temperature, isothermal decom-
position below the AP phase transition temperature (e.g., Tolmachoff
et al. [95]). Previous work did observe a change in decomposition rates

8

when the gaseous atmosphere was changed from Ar to NH3 [96], for
example. The increased vapor pressure of NH3 likely reduced the
desorption reaction rate of surface NH3, which would limit the decom-
position rate of the solid. Even though that observation may be more of a
thermodynamic effect, it identifies that under some conditions hetero-
geneous reactions may be important. The heterogeneous reaction
mechanisms require further investigation to quantify how important
they are in different scenarios. Since gas-phase reactions are certainly
important, the focus of this review regarding AP combustion kinetics
will be on the reaction of the main two gas-phase decomposition prod-
ucts, NH3 and HClO4.

2.2.1. NH3-related experimental measurements

As seen in Fig. 4, there has been much more research done with re-
gard to studying NH3 and related nitrogen chemistry than for chlorine
compounds. A considerable percentage of this work has come over the
past decade or so as a result of the increased interest in ammonia as a
hydrogen source and a fuel in its own right. Hence, there are several sets
of data that can be used to help validate the ammonia-related chemical
kinetics. Measurements of ignition delay times, laminar flame speeds,
species-concentration time histories, and speciation for ammonia (NH3)
were identified from the literature, summarized as follows.

Ammonia pyrolysis was studied in Alturaifi et al. [97], and NH3
time-history profiles can be found for temperatures ranging from 2096
to 2487 K at near-atmospheric pressure. Moreover, Davidson et al. [98]
performed NH3 pyrolysis in Argon (Ar) at 1 atm and 2000–3000 K, and
obtained NH2 and NH time histories. Ignition delay times for NH3
oxidation highly diluted in Ar can be found in Fujii et al. [99], Mathieu
and Petersen (2015) [73], and Chen et al. [100] with pressures ranging
from 1.2 to 30 atm, temperatures ranging from 1020 to 2455 K, and φ =
0.5–2.0. Shu et al. [101] worked with NH3 in air with high-pressure
shock-tube experiments (20–40 atm), for temperatures between 1100
and 1600 K, and equivalence ratios of φ = 0.5–2.0. Laminar flame speeds
for NH3 have been extensively studied, and one condition among others
has been thoroughly covered by several groups: 1 atm, 298 K, and φ =
0.7–1.3 [102–113]. Finally, speciation data via flow reactors [114–118]
and jet-stirred reactors [115,119,120] are available in the literature. A
summary of the main experimental studies for NH3 can be found in the
Supplementary Material (Table SM2). Two reviews on the recent ad-
vances on ammonia combustion from fundamentals to applications can
also be found in Kobayashi et al. [121] and Elbaz et al. [122]. With the
current interest in using ammonia as a carbon-free fuel over the past few
years, ammonia combustion has become one of the main research topics
[123], and the number of specialized scientific journal is exponentially
growing. In 2023, the journals Combustion and Flame [124–132], Pro-
ceedings of the Combustion Institute [133–143], and Fuel [144–156]
encompass more than thirty articles (alone or in mixtures with another
fuel such as hydrogen and methane, to cite a few.

2.2.2. N2O-related experimental measurements

Nitrous oxide has been investigated in shock tubes [157–164],
combustion vessels [165–171], a flat flame burner [172], and two types
of reactors: a micro flow reactor [173] and a jet-stirred reactor [174].
This experimental database covers a wide range of temperatures
(1200–2476 K) and pressures (1–28 atm) behind reflected shock waves,
and Mulvihill et al. worked with tunable laser absorption diagnostics
that permit the monitoring of N2O [164] and H2O [162], respectively.
Both H2/N2O and CH4/N2O systems are available in the literature and
provide laminar flame speeds for a large equivalence ratio span (φ =
0.11–2.33/3), and pressures from 70 torr to 2 bar at 335 and 293 K,
respectively. Lastly, the speciation in Cornell et al. [174] shows N2O,
NO, and NH3 quantification from an NH3/N2O/N2 mixture using a
residence time of 1.2 s, T = 850–1180 K, and near-atmospheric pressure.
Individual details about N2O-related data are presented in the Supple-
mentary Material (see Table SM3).

2.2.3. NOx-related experimental measurements

The NOx-related experimental measurements regroup NO2 and NO
involved in systems with CH4 or H2. Initially, the CH4/NOx was
employed to understand the NOx effects for potential renewable biogas,
in which the main compound present is ammonia, which converts easily
to NOx with oxygen [175]; and the H2/NO2 kinetics was important in
rocket propellant applications [176]. These experimental measurements
can now be used as part of a meaningful database for AP/HTPB
gas-phase mechanism validation. Ignition delay times of CH4/NO2 and
H2/NO2 were performed at different mixture conditions (pyrolysis, in O2
or in air) and dilutions (N2 or Ar) over temperatures ranging from 1200
to 2455 K, pressures from 1.1 to 33 atm and equivalence ratios from 0.5
In addition, H2O time-history profiles
to 2.0 [159,163,177,178].
measured in a shock tube were carried out in 0.98–0.994 Ar between
917 and 1782 K and at 1 atm. Since the focus of this paper ultimately is
on AP chemical kinetics, a thorough review of all NOx/HC-related ki-
netics studies is not done here; such data of course would be of interest
when modeling a complete AP/HTPB system, which is beyond the pre-
sent scope.

Flow reactor speciation for NH3/NO can be found in Kasuya et al.
[179]. Species such as H2O, NO2, and NO were measured in jet-stirred
reactors encompassing temperatures from 950 to 1450 K, and lean
NH3/NO/O2 mixtures for atmospheric [180] and lower pressures [181].
In a similar device (jet-stirred reactor), Song et al. determined the mole
fractions of NH3, NO, and N2O for CH4/NO2 mixtures at φ = 0.5–2.0, T
= 650–1200 K, P = 1 atm, and a residence time, τ, of 1.5 s [175]. A
summary of the NOx-related experimental measurements is provided in
the Supplementary Material (Table SM4).

2.2.4. HClO4-related experimental measurements

As outlined in Fig. 4, the high-temperature chemical kinetics of
perchloric acid and related chlorine oxidation has been much less
studied than for the NH3- and NOx-related molecules. The perchloric
acid combustion kinetics have been studied individually only in Com-
bourieu et al. [182] in 1969, to the best of our knowledge. Burning
velocities were measured for the decomposition of HClO4, more pre-
cisely HClO4/2.17H2O at 298 K, and atmospheric pressure in 0.14–0.37
N2. Therefore, a very limited database is available in the literature, even
if one were to include the properties of premixed flames of perchloric
acid with various hydrocarbons such as methane [182–185], ethane
[186], ethylene [187,188], and mixed fuels [189] in rich conditions.
Although the models selected in this review primarily focus on AP

chemistry, the Gross model [39] does contain a CH4 sub-mechanism, so
it can be tested against at least the HClO4/CH4 mixtures. With the scarce
amount of HClO4-related experimental measurements, the Gross model
permits this work to extend our examination with this alternative:
HClO4-CH4-rich flames. Consequently, the three following studies —that
include clear, useable burning velocities— were selected to investigate
HClO4 reaction sub-mechanism performance with the addition of
methane: Pearson [183], Combourieu et al. [182], and Hall and Pearson
[184], as reported in the Supplementary Material (Table SM5).

2.2.5. ClO2-related experimental measurements

Chlorine dioxide chemical kinetics has also a limited amount of
experimental data, focused primarily on laminar flame speeds in low-
pressure burners [182,190] and induction periods [191,192]. Blends
with ClO2 —either CH4 or NH3— were performed for the flame speeds.
However, Combourieu and Moreau [190] give three data points for pure
ClO2 at 295 K for the following low pressures: 10 torr, 30 torr, and 50
torr. The induction-period work was carried out for three different
mixtures: pure ClO2, ClO2 in N2, and ClO2 in air with a range of tem-
peratures and pressures of 293–407 K and 0.2 torr to 1 atm, respectively.
On a side note, theoretical flame temperatures were addressed [193]
and appear to be relevant for our model evaluation to assess funda-
mental mechanism features. The Supplementary Material (Table SM6)
discloses the experimental condition details for ClO2.

2.2.6. Cl2-related experimental measurements

While chlorine (Cl2) ignition delay time measurements and laminar
flame speeds can be found in the literature, there are still only a scarce
number of results available, especially when compared to NH3. Lifshitz
and Schechner [194] evaluated Cl2/H2 mixtures in Ar using a shock tube
between 1 and 4.6 atm, 780 and 1260 K, and φ = 0.5–2. Also, Corbeels
and Scheller [195], and Leylegian et al. [196] offered laminar flame
speeds from their combustion chambers for Cl2/H2 mixtures in N2 at 1
atm, 298 K, and φ = 1–2. On the other hand, Vandooren et al. [197]
studied the structure of one rich, premixed flat flame of H2/Cl2 in Ar.
The speciation of H2, Cl2, and HCl was possible using a Molecular Beam
Sampling Mass Spectrometry (MBMS) technique. Table SM7 in the
Supplementary Material summarizes this collection of data that are of
crucial interest in evaluating AP/HTPB chemical kinetics model per-
formance using relevant gas-phase experimental data.

2.3. HTPB-related kinetics and experimental measurements

3.1. Ammonia kinetics

Pyrolysis and oxidation of polybutadienes (and other polymers used
for solid/hybrid propulsion) have been widely studied over the last 50+
years. An earlier review of polymer pyrolysis is given by Beck, although
detailed chemistry is not included [198]. The detailed kinetics of these
processes are beyond the scope of this manuscript, but it is worth a brief
discussion since the gaseous pyrolysis products will mix and react with
AP decomposition products and intermediates. As such, this discussion is
not meant to be exhaustive.

◦

◦

Experiments using slow heating rates (e.g., differential scanning
calorimetry) have been well-documented, although the heating rates are
orders of magnitude slower and result in much different kinetics and
species. For example, Chiaverini et al. observed only 1,3 butadiene (BD)
and 4-vinyl-cyclohexane (VCH) at low temperatures (~500
C) from
HTPB pyrolysis [199]. The pyrolysis products favored C2 at higher
C). A similar trend was observed elsewhere
temperatures (up to 800
[200,201], where the microstructure of the polybutadiene influenced
the ratio of the product mole fractions [200]. The limiting step of py-
rolysis under fast heating rates and the higher temperatures referenced
is the desorption from the bulk polymer surface. The rapid oxidation of
these polymers is often studied in a counterflow configuration or
laser-assisted deflagration [202–205]. However, these experiments are
primarily interested in the linear regression rate and similar bulk
quantities, not detailed chemical kinetics. The oxidation of primary
pyrolysis products (e.g., BD, C2 hydrocarbons, etc.) are well studied in
the kinetics community.

3. Nitrogen-based sub-mechanisms

In this section, the experimental kinetics data obtained from the
literature, introduced in the previous section, are compared against the
predictions of the three AP chemical kinetics mechanisms of interest
herein. Nitrogen-related cases are covered first, where these nitrogen
species originate from the gas-phase ammonia present initially, directly
from the AP. For several sets of data, the authors found that one or more
of the mechanisms could not even generate results due to missing
chemical reactions or species that are necessary to produce some of the
results contained in the compiled database. In some cases, minor mod-
ifications were made to the mechanisms so they could even be used to
make such predictions (or in some cases to make drastic improvements
over original predictions). These modifications are not intended to offer
an improved mechanism in the present paper but rather to show the
impact of and need for the AP mechanism validation methodology
outlined herein. Also, throughout this section, applicable discussion and
analysis material is integrated within the presentation of the comparison
results.

3.1.1. NH3 pyrolysis in Ar using a shock tube: NH3 profiles

The first study presented in this section is of interest because Alturaifi
et al. [97] focused on a very simple system: NH3 pyrolysis. The devel-
opment of a laser absorption diagnostic permitted them to obtain NH3
time-history profiles behind reflected shock waves for 2.5 ms. An
assessment of 15 detailed NH3 chemical kinetics mechanisms with re-
gard to their capabilities of predicting these new pyrolysis data showed
that the literature mechanisms yield poor predictions and significantly
different predictions amongst each other, with the possible exception
from the model of Otomo et al. [206] which produced decent overall
agreement with the experimental data. None of the AP mechanisms was
designed to specifically model ammonia pyrolysis, so it should not be
expected that they perform well at all. The intent of such a comparison
with detailed NH3 pyrolysis data is to demonstrate a method for vali-
dating a full AP kinetics mechanism while also showing the state of the
art currently with regard to AP kinetics mechanisms and where im-
provements can be made (and in most cases how easy it is to make
decently improved predictions by just having a few extra, key reactions
included).

NH3 pyrolysis measurements are naturally the best candidates to
observe the first chemical step in ammonia decomposition. Since
ammonia is one of the primary species from AP monopropellant com-
bustion to start the gas-phase reaction process, NH3 pyrolysis at high
temperatures certainly is a feature that is present in AP-based propellant
combustion. As a result, the performance of the three models of interest
herein —Giovangigli et al. [37], Gross [39], and Chen and McQuaid
[50]— are also tested for ammonia decomposition. Representative
experimental NH3 profiles for NH3 pyrolysis in 0.995 Ar are shown in
Fig. 5, and both the Giovangigli et al. and Chen and McQuaid models are
compared with these 6 profiles, where the NH3 mole fraction decrease is
exacerbated as the temperature increase. While neither of these models
can predict NH3 decomposition in this simple system within an accept-
able margin, the Chen and McQuaid model is somewhat closer to the
experimental profile until ~2200 K; the Giovangigli et al. model rapidly
provides a better estimate for higher temperatures.

From the modeling perspective, the Gross model was unfortunately
not able to provide solutions within a time frame of 30 ms (about 20
times longer than the actual experimental observations). The lack of
results from this model likely comes from missing reactions within its
NH3 sub-mechanism: an analysis performed in Alturaifi et al. [97]
showed that the reactivity of NH3 pyrolysis is first initiated by R2 and
R3, and these two reactions provide the main channels for NH3
consumption

Looking closely at the thesis of Dr. Gross, three models are discussed.

1) The Universal Gas-Phase Mechanism: it includes the Puduppakkam
comprehensive mechanism [40], Lin’s Cl-containing reactions [41],
and the 12 additional reactions added to model of AP mono-
propellant combustion. The final numbers of species and reactions
are 106 and 611, respectively.

2) The ADN (Ammonium DiNitramide) Gas-Phase Mechanism, consid-
ering only H, N, and O as atomic elements. This model consists of 33
species and 173 reactions.

3) The AP/HTPB Gas-Phase Mechanism: 37 species and 127 reactions.

According to Gross, the attempts to utilize the Puduppakkam
comprehensive mechanism to model AP resulted in poor burning rate
and final species calculations. Nevertheless, the reactions R2 and R3 are
listed in the ‘Universal Gas-Phase Mechanism’ but unfortunately are not
present in the final AP/HTPB mechanism utilized in their work to

simulate AP combustion, likely due to size constraints (37 species and
127 reactions). Fig. 6 presents the predictions of an NH3 profile for NH3
pyrolysis in Ar at 2328 K, 1.16 atm [97] compared with the Pudup-
pakkam mechanism and the Gross model with the addition of R2, and
both R2 and R3. The Gross model was finally able to simulate some NH3
decomposition thanks to the addition of R2, but is much closer to the
data when both R2 and R3 are implemented. On the one hand, this
minor change is incredibly important when compared to the experi-
mental measurements and, on the other hand, is very insightful when
compared to the Puduppakkam comprehensive mechanism. This
demonstration suggests that omitting these two key reactions has a
dramatic impact on the predictions obtained from the gas-phase reaction
mechanism.

Another important conclusion that can be drawn from the results in
Figs. 5 and 6 is that none of the models can suitably reproduce ammonia
decomposition, so there is room for improvement in the future. Of

course, the experimental NH3 time histories shown in these plots were
only recently available, so older models could not naturally benefit
therefrom. Finally, all the profiles compared with the two models of
Giovangigli et al. [37] and Chen and McQuaid [50] can be found in the
Supplementary Material (SM#3). Moreover, the Gross model + R2 + R3
is also compared to the same sample of temperatures presented in Fig. 5,
and is available in the SM#4.

3.1.2. NH3 pyrolysis in Ar using a shock tube: NH2 and NH profiles

Measurements of the NH2 and NH concentration profiles were per-
formed using narrow-linewidth laser absorption diagnostics in Davidson
et al. [98]. The measured concentrations were used to derive the rate
coefficients for the reactions NH2 + H → NH + H2, NH2 + NH → N2H2 +
H, and NH2 + NH2 → NH + NH3. NH3 pyrolysis data in 0.997 Ar can also
be found in the study from Davidson et al. [98], where they shared four
very useful profiles. Fig. 7 (a) and Fig. 7 (b) show two NH2 profiles at

2301 K, 1.028 atm, and 2781 K, 0.902 atm, respectively. The Gio-
vangigli et al. [37] model matches fairly well with the data in Fig. 7 (a)
and is in excellent agreement in Fig. 7 (b), whereas the Chen and
McQuaid [50] model predicts a significantly larger amount of NH2 that
still increases within the timeframe considered (red dashed lines). The
reason for this behavior is that their mechanism does not include the NH
species, which should be considered as a major intermediate in NH3
chemistry, and the absence of NH prevents the NH2-to-NH conversion in
the model. The Gross [37] model does not produce any NH2 and NH at
these specific conditions, limited by the missing reactions R2 and R3, as
previously discussed. Fig. 7 (c) and Fig. 7 (d) represent two NH profiles
at 2294 K, 0.986 atm, and 2652 K, 0.876 atm, respectively. As
mentioned above, only the Giovangigli et al. [37] model can be tracked.

The work from Davidson et al. [98] did not provide all the profiles
they collected for different Ar concentrations (99–99.9 %) at 1 atm and
temperatures ranging from 2000 to 3200 K; however, the experimental
measurements were extrapolated into two single points: one represent-
ing the NH2 or NH mole fraction when the profile reaches its maximum
(cid:0)
, and the other representing the time when the
Xmax,NH2 or Xmax,NH
profile reaches its maximum
. Fig. 8 summarizes
the performance of the Giovangigli et al. and Chen and McQuaid models
with these two, single-point physical representations for NH2 in Fig. 8
(a) and Fig. 8 (b). As already visible in Fig. 7 (a) and Fig. 7 (b), the
Giovangigli et al. model has good agreement with the Davidson et al.
data, but the Chen and McQuaid model is not able to reproduce accu-
rately Xmax,NH2 and τXmax,NH2. Similarly, Xmax,NH and τXmax,NH are well

3.1.3. NH3 oxidation in Ar using a shock tube: ignition delay times

Research into ammonia combustion and oxidation is currently
receiving much interest, and there are many studies that have generated
ignition delay times in shock tubes and RCMs for NH3 and NH3/fuel
blends over the past few years. Some examples just since 2021 include
the work of Chen et al. on blends of H2 and NH3 [100]; Shu et al. on
blends of NH3 and CH4 [207]; and Dong et al. on blends of NH3 with
n-C7H16 [85], to name a few. Most if not all of these studies can be used
for validating the NH3 sub-mechanism chemistry within the larger AP
mechanism. In the present paper (Sections 3.1.3 and 3.1.4), the authors
have selected just a few representative cases for just pure NH3 for the
sake of conciseness but without losing sight of the end result that AP and
AP/HTPB kinetics mechanism developers need to consider recent data
coming out of all the ongoing ammonia research.

Ignition delay times were performed for the oxidation of NH3 in
diluted mixtures (NH3/O2 in 0.92–0.99 Ar) in three studies: Fujii et al.
[99], Mathieu and Petersen [73], and Chen et al. [100]. The ranges of
experimental conditions covered are the following: pressures between 1
and 30 atm, temperatures ranging from 1020 to 2455 K, and equivalence
ratios between 0.5 and 2.0. Fig. 9 regroups the entire set of data from the
three above mentioned articles, where they are compared to the three
AP/HTPB models. The Giovangigli et al. [37] model overall un-
derestimates the ignition delay times, even more drastically at higher
pressures and colder temperatures. Also, the predicted ignition delay
times at 1 atm are 30 % too short contrasted to the experimental mea-
surements and are two times lower at colder-range temperature condi-
tions. Overall, the higher-pressure numerical results (10 and 20 atm) are
systematically three times below those of the Mathieu and Petersen [73]
data, except at the rich equivalence ratio φ = 2.0 for which the averaged

difference is estimated at 80 %.

It is noteworthy to point out that the Giovangigli et al. [37] kinetics
model is in excellent agreement with results from Fujii et al. [99]. A
possible explanation could be the method to post-process the ignition
delay times. In fact, the OH* peak can be well-predicted by the model,
but the rise of OH* excitation is more challenging. Mathieu and Petersen
[73] defined the ignition delay time as the intersection of the ‘steepest
rate-of-change’ of OH* and the zero-concentration level lines, taking
into account the peak shape. Therefore, these data contain extra infor-
mation, and so the model is lacking in that regard, more importantly at

colder temperatures. The authors would like to also remind the readers
that the set of data from Fujii et al. suffers from inaccurate pressure
definition (a range of 2.5–7.5 atm is provided in the paper, so an average
of 5 atm was used for the modeling), leading to some additional un-
certainty in the model calculations. Lastly, the comparison of the mea-
surements from Chen et al. [100] and the model are showing the largest
discrepancies, where the Giovangigli et al. [37] model is at least three
and up to five times lower than the experimental ignition delay times.

3.1.3.1. Gross model issue: understanding and correction. While the Gross
model is not visible in Fig. 9, it is worth mentioning that the Chen and
McQuaid mechanism was not able to provide results either. Alturaifi
et al. [97] suggested that the effect of the NH3 pyrolysis sub-mechanism
on the performance of detailed ammonia oxidation chemical kinetics
models during both NH3 pyrolysis and oxidation should be taken into
consideration. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis in Mathieu and Petersen
revealed that reactions R4, R5, and R6 play major roles in the reaction
pathways used during ammonia oxidation, and neither of R4 and R5 is
implemented in the Gross model. No addition of R6 was needed, as this
reaction was present in the Gross reaction mechanism.

Fig. 10 aims to show that while the incorporation of R2 and R3 in the
Gross model (discussed above) is already helping the numerical pre-
dictions (dashed lines), the further addition of just R4 and R5 leads to
very good agreement with the experimental data (solid lines).

issue: understanding. Mathieu and
3.1.3.2. Chen and McQuaid model
Petersen also mentioned that the reaction R6 is sensitive under their
conditions; however there is no NH included in the Chen and McQuaid
mechanism, as discussed previously with regard to the results from
Davidson et al. [98]. We suspect that the chemical kinetics in this model
require more attention, as reactions R2, R3, R4, and R5 alone were not
enough to help the Chen and McQuaid model to converge to a solution

for describing ammonia ignition delay times.

This problem with predicting any IDT at all likely comes from
missing reactions within the NH3 sub-mechanism. It is not clear how this
lack of important reactions impacts the AP/HTPB combustion pre-
dictions without further analysis, but it likely limits the proper modeling
of AP reactivity from any gas-phase chemistry due to the NH3.

3.1.4. NH3 oxidation in air using a shock tube: ignition delay times

Ignition delay times have also been measured for NH3/air mixtures.
The data presented herein are from Shu et al. [101], and the experi-
mental conditions are: P = 20 and 40 atm, T = 1100–1600 K, and φ = 0.5
to 2.0. Once again, it has been found that only the Giovangigli et al. [37]
model can provide results within a reasonable time frame, as shown in
Fig. 11. However, the mechanism from Giovangigli et al. underestimates
the ignition delay times for the conditions tested by factors of 2–5. In this
context and as seen in Section 3.1.3, the Gross [39] and Chen and
McQuaid [50] models do not show any reactivity at all for NH3 oxidation
in air.

The NH3 oxidation in Ar is less complex than NH3 in air due to the
number of reactions involved in the process in addition to the level of
dilution, with the third body species Ar compared to N2 (3 reactions
versus 11 reactions in the Gross model). Similar to the previous section,
the Gross model with the addition of R2, R3, R4, and R5 was tested, and
results can be seen in Fig. 12 (dashed lines): the accuracy is still unsat-
isfactory. Interestingly, Kohno et al. studied the enhancement of NH2 +
NO → OH + H + N2 by vibrational excitation of NH2 [208], and the
characterization of the reaction NH2 + NO was also theoretically
investigated [209,210]. Walch considered the two most important
channels NH2 + NO → N2 + H2O (R7) and NH2 + NO → NNH + OH
[209] (R8), and Diau et al. focused on the same reactions [210].

NH2 + NO ⇆ N2 + H2O

NH2 + NO ⇆ NNH + OH

(R7)

(R8)

Additionally, the kinetics of the two following reactions starting with
NH2 + NO2 giving N2O + H2O (R9) or H2NO + NO (R10) were inves-
tigated by estimating their branching ratios within three different works
[211–213].

Shu et al. indicated that NH2 + NO = NNH + OH (R8) is crucial
within their experimental conditions, as well as the chain branching
reaction with H2NO + O2 to form HNO + HO2 (R11). We observed that
the Gross model does not include either NNH or H2NO in its listed
species.

Finally, two suspicious reactions are present in the model: NH2 +
NO2 ⇆ 2 HNO (R12) and NH2 + NO ⇆ H + N2 + OH (R13), as never
determined to be important previously. Actually, removing the reactions
R12 and R13 in the Gross model showed a noticeable improvement, as
seen in Fig. 12, since the model is now able to predict that ignition does
indeed occur at these conditions. Nevertheless, the model results (like
those in Fig. 11 as well) are very much faster than the data, and the
chemistry still needs to be explored further. Interestingly, the omission
of R12 and R13 does not impact the performance of the Gross model in

3.1.5. NH3 oxidation in air using a combustion chamber: laminar flame
speeds

The laminar flame speeds for NH3 in air have been extensively
studied in the literature, and one condition among others has been
thoroughly performed at 1 atm, and 298 K with the range of equivalence
ratios φ = 0.7 to 1.3 [102–113]. Although there is still some discrepancy
in the literature with regard to the scatter in the measured laminar flame
speeds at this condition, the collection of data is sufficient to gauge the
accuracy of the ammonia portion of the AP kinetics mechanisms. As seen
in Fig. 13, neither the Giovangigli et al. [37] or Chen and McQuaid [50]
models could converge to a solution for laminar flame speed at this
significantly
condition. Nevertheless,
over-reactive for this mixture. Room for improvement is visible for these
predictions. For instance, the aforementioned four key reactions (R2-5)
were added to the Gross model [39], and Fig. 12 compares the Gross
model [39] (solid line) to the modified Gross model (dashed lines). It is
encouraging to depict an average decrease of 29 % in the laminar flame
speeds, hence getting closer to the range of experimental data. A flame
speed sensitivity analysis for ammonia-air is provided in Section 5.1.

3.1.6. NH3 oxidation in Ar using a jet-stirred reactor: speciation

Manna et al. [114] studied NH3 pyrolysis and oxidation, φ = 1.0, in
0.86–0.92 Ar for a residence time (τ) of 0.25 s, at 1.2 atm and tested the
effect of a small addition of water. This work regroups speciation of O2,
H2, N2, and NO, whereas Stagni et al. [115] recorded two species: NH3
and NO. Their experimental conditions are defined as follows: NH3
oxidation for very lean mixtures in He, with τ = 1.5 s at 1.05 atm.
Representative species evolution according to temperature is shown in
Fig. 14, and none of the models could accurately reproduce the expected
shape or magnitude of each species.

Zhang et al. [119] and Osipova et al. [120] both operated jet-stirred
reactors for NH3 oxidation at 1 atm and τ = 1 s. Zhang et al. diluted their
mixtures in N2, while Osipova et al. diluted theirs in Ar. A large body of
species (NH3, O2, N2, H2O, NO, N2O) was monitored, and a good sample
is visible in Fig. 15. Unfortunately, similar conclusions can be made for
the models.

3.1.7. Representative modeling using an NH3-related mechanism

Needless to say, significant improvement can be made to the AP ki-
netics mechanism by simply incorporating the extensive results of recent
ammonia kinetics research. Most of the modern NH3 kinetics models will
be able to reproduce the bulk of the data presented above with a high
level of accuracy. Although it is not the intent of the present work to
propose an updated AP model or even to determine which NH3 sub-
mechanism to employ in an improved AP model, it is important to at

least show the predictive difference between a current AP mechanism
and a validated ammonia mechanism; any of the modern NH3 models
would be sufficient for this purpose.

In fact, He et al. [214] compiled 14 studies presenting experimental
measurements for ammonia and, while describing the important con-
clusions, they acknowledged which of several detailed NH3 chemical
mechanisms are validated for the experimental conditions that they
examined. For future reference, Table 2 summarizes the recent

assessment of the ammonia combustion mechanisms, based on He et al.
and restricted to the latest studies. To demonstrate the accuracy of a
modern ammonia kinetics model that has been validated with funda-
mental kinetics data, the Mathieu and Petersen model [73] was
employed to simulate the literature data presented in the previous few
sections. Fig. 16 shows the relatively high accuracy that the ammonia
mechanism has when predicting ignition delay times, species time his-
tories, laminar flame speeds, and jet-stirred reactor speciation data. The
results in Fig. 16 can be compared to the corresponding predictions
shown in Figs. 9(b)–Figs. 13 and 7 (a), and Fig. 15 (a). More comparisons
can be found in the Supplementary Material.

3.2. Nitrous oxide kinetics

3.2.1. N2O in 0.8 Ar using a shock tube: N2O profiles

The study from Mulvihill et al. [164] presented in this section
focused on a simple system: N2O pyrolysis. Again, the development of a
laser absorption diagnostic permitted them to obtain N2O time-history
profiles behind reflected shock waves within a shock tube for 2.5 ms.
The nitrous oxide predictions are of major importance during ammonia
combustion, as N2O is an important combustion intermediate during
NH3 oxidation [121]. The N2O pyrolysis measurements were carried out
at temperatures ranging from 1546 to 2476 K and pressures from 1.08 to
1.43 atm in 0.998 Ar. Representative experimental N2O profiles are
visible in Fig. 17 along with two models: Giovangigli et al. [37] and

17

Gross [39]. As one can see, there is fair agreement between the Gio-
vangigli et al. model and the data. Unfortunately, the Gross model
predicts the N2O decomposition to be very fast, almost instantaneous at
the conditions of the study, leading to a large disagreement over the
entire set of experimental data. Finally, all the profiles compared with
the two models of Giovangigli et al. [37] and Gross [39] can be found in
the SM#7.

Mulvihill et al. determined the three most sensitive reactions that
dominate the N2O decomposition at these experimental conditions as
follows

N2O (+M) ⇆ N2 + O (+M)

N2O + O ⇆ N2 + O2

N2O + O ⇆ NO + NO

(R14)

(R15)

(R16)

A simple replacement of the reaction R14 in the Gross model using
the parameters A, b, and Ea from Giovangigli et al. leads to significant
improvement in reproducing the N2O profiles with a high level of ac-
curacy, as can be seen in Fig. 18. Their rate constants are defined as
follows, with units of cal, mol, cm, K, s.

on N2O only, it is a good alternative to also consider these blends for our
AP chemistry modeling efforts.

Note that Mulvihill et al. validated a low-pressure limit rate constant

et al. [174] conducted jet-stirred reactor experiments of an NH3/N2O/N2
mixture over a temperature range of 850–1180 K at near atmospheric
pressure. Four measurement methods were employed to detect the mole
fractions of NH3, N2O, and NO for a residence time of 1.2 s: gas chro-
matography,
electrochemical detection, and
infrared absorption. While proving excellent agreement among the
different diagnostics, they addressed a gap between experimental data
and the kinetics models: many submodels rely on rate constant estimates
that likely have not been tested or validated with this type of experi-
mental study [174].

articles, and results from the Giovangigli et al. model show fairly good
agreement for this wide scope of experimental conditions.

On the contrary, the Gross model displays some interesting behavior:
a non-linear phenomenon usually occurring at lower temperatures for
common hydrocarbons, visible in Fig. 21. Typically, experiments in
shock tubes do not exhibit such behavior; however, ignition delay times
carried out in an RCM are captured for temperatures below 1000 K and
depict non-linear events. A nice example can be found in the literature
for simple saturated hydrocarbons, namely the pentane isomers [223].
Additionally, the Gross model overpredicts the ignition delay times:
when compared to the data from Mulvihill et al. [163] for the lowest and
highest temperatures (1447 K and 1775 K, respectively), the model is 28
and 275 times higher than the measured delay, respectively.

3.2.2.3. N2O/H2 in 0.98 Ar using a shock tube: H2O profiles. Quantita-
tive H2O time histories behind reflected shock waves for 2.5 ms were
recorded using laser absorption diagnostics. Four H2O profiles are pre-
sented in Mulvihill et al. [162] and constitute measurements between
1414 and 1757 K, 1.13 and 1.22 atm in rich conditions, as H2 is very
dominant in the mixture (N2O:H2 is 1:8), and in 0.98 Ar. These experi-
mental measurements are shown in Fig. 22 with the Giovangigli et al.
[37] model that does not reproduce the water time-history profiles with
great accuracy. Numerical predictions obtained with the Gross model
started the induction of water at around 20 ms and reached a plateau
after 50 ms when tested at 1757 K, 1.13 atm. Similar results are observed
for the lower-temperature samples, also considered out of the reasonable
time frame.

3.2.2.4. N2O/H2 in diluent: laminar flame speeds. Laminar flame speeds
for the N2O/H2 system were obtained at quite different experimental
conditions, offering low (0.1 atm), intermediate (0.2 atm), and near-
atmospheric pressures (0.8–1 atm), temperatures ranging from 298 to
335 K, and equivalence ratios of φ = 0.11–2.20. Two experimental
methods, a combustion vessel and a flat flame burner, were used by Gray
et al. [166] and M ́evel et al. [169] (former), and Bane et al. [170] and
Powell et al. [172] (the latter). A summary of their experiments is
is close to the
illustrated in Fig. 23, where the Gross model

lower-pressure data from Gray et al., but is having difficulties for the
three other types of mixture, for example in Fig. 23(b)–Fig. 23 (c), and
Fig. 23 (d). Numerical predictions performed for the Bane et al. work
gave flame speeds up to 5 times higher than the measurements at the
very lean conditions. A large decrease is observed for flame speeds when
the pressure augments to 0.8 or 1 atm, determined to be 5 to 9 times less
than the ones described at 0.1 and 0.2 atm. Nevertheless, the Gross
model continues to overpredict the laminar flame speeds by up to 3 and
2.7 times at rich conditions for the Powell et al. and M ́evel et al. data,
respectively.

The Giovangigli et al. model did not converge to a solution: even if
the N2O profiles and the ignition delay times were overall well under-
stood previously, the water profiles, supposedly a final product in the
combustion process, revealed a very fast reactivity, strongly suggesting
that the laminar flame speeds could be extremely high, above our nu-
merical capabilities. This remark emphasizes the need of multiple
diagnostic techniques and experiment platforms to verify the fidelity of a
chemical kinetics mechanism. The validation of a gas-phase model re-
quires a body of experimental results,
from global kinetics data
involving many reactions (ignition delay times or laminar flame speeds)
to speciation and rate coefficient measurements.

3.2.2.5. N2O/CH4 in Ar using a shock tube: ignition delay times. Ignition
delay times were performed for the oxidation of N2O/CH4 in diluted
mixtures, varying from 1220 to 2336 K, 1.2–10 atm, φ = 0.5 to 2.0 in
0.89–0.96 Ar, and can be found in these two studies: M ́evel et al. [160]
and Deng et al. [161]. The average pressure selected for the M ́evel et al.
work was assumed to be 2.7 atm (initially ranging from 2.2 to 3.2 atm),
as not each data point was individually characterized in their manu-
script. The comparison with the models only includes the Gross model
[39] because both the Giovangigli et al. [37] and Chen and McQuaid
[50] models do not incorporate CH4 in their chemical reactions. Fig. 24
shows the experimental data from the literature and, surprisingly, the
Gross model displays unusual behavior, similar to the N2O/H2 ignition
delay times case presented in Fig. 21. To further investigate the nu-
merical predictions, and for a better overview, the temperature range
has been extended to lower values, reaching almost 700 K. A non-linear

3.2.2.6. N2O/CH4 in N2 using a combustion vessel: laminar flame speeds.
Finally, laminar flame speeds have been recorded for N2O/CH4 diluted
in N2 by Mitu et al. [171] over pressures from 0.5 to 2 bar, at 293 K and
φ = 0.8 and 1.0. The Gross model over-predicts the results (see Fig. 26),
in correlation with the over-reactive behavior observed for ignition
delay times in Figs. 24 and 25.

3.3.1. NO2/H2 in 0.994 Ar using a shock tube: ignition delay times

Mulvihill et al. performed shock-tube experiments to measure igni-
tion delay times for H2/NO2 in 0.994 Ar, covering temperatures from
1535 to 2003 K at 1.1 atm [163]. Additionally, the peaks of OH* were
normalized to the maximum peak obtained at the highest temperature:
2003 K. Results are compared to the models from Giovangigli et al. [37]
and Gross [39] in Fig. 27, where the Giovangigli et al. model [37] is
displaying fair agreement with the data, as opposed to the Gross model
being almost out of the experimental time frame. The Chen and
McQuaid model [50] did not display any ignition for these cases.

Fig. 33. Burning velocities of xCH4, HClO4, 2.17 H2O, yN2/Ar mixtures at 1 atm, 293 K [182] compared with the Gross model [39].

According to Mulvihill et al. [224], the important route of NO2

decomposition takes place primarily through the reaction

2 NO2 ⇆ NO3 + NO

(R17)

Reaction R17 is only implemented in the Giovangigli et al. [37]
chemical kinetics mechanism because the NO3 species was not consid-
ered by the two other models, although NO2 also decomposes due to R18
and R19. A rapid verification of the Gross model performance using
these two additional reactions shows that improvements can be made,
see Fig. 28, where the initial Gross model was twenty times higher than
the experimental ignition delay times, but the modified version varies
between five and ten times larger.

where the model does not capture the H2O production within a
reasonable time frame. Finally, the Gross model does not perform well,
and a brief example is visible in Fig. 29 (a) with the dashed blue line. The
induction delay time only starts at 6 ms, but when R18 and R19 are
incorporated into the model, H2O is produced around 3.5 ms instead.

As mentioned earlier, significant complications are observed for the
Giovangigli et al. model at φ = 1.25 or higher, indicating that H2 is a
limiting factor. Mulvihill et al. emphasized an additional reaction
pathway at fuel-rich conditions [224], via R20 and R21.

NO2 + H2 ⇆ HONO + H

NO2 + H2 ⇆ HNO2 + H

(R20)

(R21)

NO2 + M ⇆ NO + O + M

NO2 + O ⇆ NO + O2

(R18)

(R19)

This pathway prevents HNO2 isomerization to HONO, and then a

portion of HONO decomposes via R22.

HONO (+M) ⇆ OH + NO (+M)

(R22)

3.3.2. NO2/H2 in 0.994 Ar using a shock tube: H2O profiles

Mulvihill et al. continued the investigation on H2/NO2 using a laser
absorption diagnostic to obtain H2O time-history profiles [224], same as
in Mulvihill et al. [162] for the H2/N2O study. The experimental con-
ditions cover temperatures ranging from 917 to 1782 K, a pressure of 1
atm, and a dilution of 0.994 Ar. Representative H2O profiles are shown
in Fig. 29 for lean, near stoichiometric, and fuel-rich mixtures. The
comparison with the Giovangigli et al. model demonstrates fairly good
agreement in Fig. 29 (a), (b), and (c), representing the lean-fuel blend (φ
= 0.3), but the performance drastically decreases at φ = 1.25 and 5.29,

3.3.3. NO2/CH4 in Ar using a shock tube: ignition delay times

Aside from NO2/H2 experimental investigations, the NO2/CH4 sys-
tem has also been studied: Mathieu et al. used two different blends
[159], CH4/NO2/O2 and CH4/NO2 in air, both diluted in Ar, to obtain
ignition delay times at φ = 0.5–2.0, T = 1200–1800 K, and P = 1–29
atm. Again, comparisons with the available models are limited by the
presence of CH4 in this work, so only the Gross model [39] was tested.
Overall, the model over-predicts the entire set of results on a logarithmic
scale, but when the reactions R18 and R19 are implemented, some
improvement is observed: the numerical ignition delay times decrease
from twenty-four times higher than the experimental measurements to
only three times higher in Fig. 30 (a), (b), and (c). The effect of these two
reactions is not as great for CH4/NO2 in air with some Ar, but the

Cl2 kinetics modeling. As in Section 3, minor modifications are made to
the mechanisms so they could even be used to make such predictions for
existing data (or in some cases to make drastic improvements over
original predictions). Again, such modifications are not intended to offer
an improved mechanism herein, but rather to show the impact of and
need for the AP mechanism validation methodology demonstrated
herein. Also, applicable analysis and discussion materials are integrated
within the comparison of results.

4.1. Perchloric acid kinetics

Laminar flame speeds for systems that include HClO4 are scarce, and
as shown in Fig. 4, there are few fundamental data for this system that
can be used for validating a mechanism. Combourieu et al. [182] offer
mixtures that combine HClO4 diluted in 2.17 H2O with a certain amount
of methane and balanced with either N2 or Ar, such as xCH4, HClO4, 2.17
H2O, yN2/Ar. Unfortunately, both the Giovangigli et al. [37] and Chen
and McQuaid [50] models do not incorporate CH4 in their chemical
reactions. Fig. 33 represents the experimental measurements at 298 K
and 1 atm in which various compositions for CH4, N2, and Ar are carried
out. The numerical predictions obtained with the Gross model [39]
agree rather well with the data for these conditions. Data points for
HClO4, 2.17 H2O, yN2 in Fig. 33 (a) cannot be well-seen in the current
scale, therefore Fig. 34 focuses on these results, that constitute the only
laminar flame speeds with no methane. Hence, all the mechanisms
available can be tested for this condition.

Fig. 34 shows the Gross model compared to the HClO4, 2.17 H2O in
0.14–0.37 N2 mixture: there is an acceptable agreement. Neither Chen
and McQuaid nor Giovangigli et al. converged to a solution. A closer
look at the model from Chen and McQuaid [50] showed that a key re-
action is missing and would certainly improve the predictions for HClO4
combustion chemistry. As such, the HClO4 first steps of decomposition
are:

HClO4 ⇆ ClO3 + OH

ClO3 ⇆ ClO + O2

(R23)

(R24)

It was noticed that the reaction R24 does not appear in the Chen and

McQuaid model, preventing major reactions to follow, such as:

2 ClO ⇆ Cl2 + O2

Cl2 + O2 + M ⇆ ClO2 + Cl + M

2 ClO ⇆ Cl + ClO2

(R25)

(R26)

(R27)

The Chen and McQuaid model with R24 added into the mechanism is
indeed able to give results for the laminar flame speeds from

predictions did reduce by 23 %, 15 %, and 11 % for φ = 0.5, φ = 1.0, and
φ = 2.0, respectively (Fig. 30 (d), (e), and (f)).

3.3.4. NO2/CH4 and NO/CH4 using a jet-stirred reactor: speciation

Finally, speciation was carried out by Song et al. [175] for mixtures
of CH4/NO2/O2 and CH4/NO/O2 in Ar at φ = 0.5–2.0, temperatures
ranging from 650 to 1200 K at atmospheric pressure. Overall, it was not
possible for the Gross model to reproduce the data with much accuracy
at all for H2O, NO2, and NO (see Fig. 31).

3.3.5. NO/NH3 oxidation in Ar using a jet-stirred reactor: speciation

This section presents the last set of data used herein to evaluate the
sub-mechanisms of ammonia, analyzing the NO effect on NH3 diluted in
N2 at low pressure (30 torr) from Dagaut and Nicolle [181] and for at-
mospheric pressure from Rota et al. [180]. Representative profiles on
NH3 and NO reduction along with N2O formation are visible in Fig. 32.
Interestingly, both Dagaut and Nicolle [181] and Rota et al. [180] car-
ried similar mixtures at their pressures, and Fig. 32 (a) shows 2 NH3/NO
vs. 2.4 NH3/NO in N2 at 30 torr and 1 atm, respectively. While the
Giovangigli et al. and Chen and McQuaid models did not converge to a
solution, the Gross model does not contain reaction pathways for all the
species considered. Fig. 32 (a) also shows that the model was unable to
capture the pressure dependence.

4. Chlorine-based sub-mechanisms

In this section, we continue the kinetics analysis and comparison of
the AP mechanisms with existing data for the Cl-based species, origi-
nating via the initial gas-phase HClO4 from the AP. While there has been
significant progress in the past decade or more on ammonia chemical
kinetics, there has been comparatively little research done on chlorine-
based combustion chemistry in the literature. This situation is reflected
in the limited data sets available for the validation of detailed mecha-
nisms as well as in the slow progress of developments in HClO4, HCl, and

Combourieu et al. [182], as can be seen in Fig. 34. In the reaction
pathways observed for HClO4, the reactions R25–27 and R26 exposed
that the ClO produced by ClO3 continues to react, creating ClO2. This
chemical species plays a major role in the perchloric acid combustion
process, but Giovangigli et al. did not incorporate ClO2 in their mech-
anism. The confusion may have come from ClO2 versus ClOO, named
chlorine dioxide and chlorine superoxide, respectively. While the Gross
and the Chen and McQuaid models contain both ClO2 and ClOO, the
Giovangigli et al. model includes solely ClOO, and the absence of ClO2 is
likely responsible for the lack of performance of this model, as the au-
thors believe ClO2 has a significant impact on HClO4 chemistry.

4.2. Chlorine dioxide kinetics

4.2.1. Pure ClO2 and exotic blends: laminar flame speeds

Combourieu and Moreau studied the laminar flame speeds of ClO2/
C2H2 mixtures at 295 K for pressures ranging from 10 to 50 torr [190].
While none of the models were able to reproduce the results because of
the presence of C2H2 (which is not present in the AP models), three
measurements are still available when pure ClO2 is not mixed with C2H2.
Table 3 reports these data along with the numerical predictions from the
Gross [39] and the Chen and McQuaid [50] models, except the Gio-
vangigli et al. [37] mechanism that does not have ClO2 species included
in their reactions, as already mentioned. Additionally, flames were
stabilized at a pressure of 100 torr on a Pyrex burner to record the
burning velocities of two mixtures that are also of interest herein: 0.7
ClO2/0.3 CH4 and, using the same proportions between ClO2 and CH4
with an addition of 25 % NH3, meaning 0.56 ClO2/0.24 CH4/0.2 NH3
[193]. For these couple of velocities, only the Gross model is compared,
as CH4 is only included in their reaction set, and can be seen in Table 3.
Lastly, Combourieu et al. [182] worked with blends of CH4/ClO2 in
yN2 (y = 2–10) at 295 K and 100 torr, and the experimental measure-
ments are compared with the Gross model in Fig. 35. The detailed
chemical kinetics mechanism performs poorly for the laminar flame
speeds for pure ClO2, ClO2/CH4 and ClO2/CH4 in N2. The smallest
discrepancy is visible for the ClO2/CH4/NH3 case, in which the effect of
NH3 is mostly responsible for this 12% difference between the experi-
mental measurement and the predicted value.

It is also noteworthy to emphasize the lack of variable test conditions
and the difficulty in experimentally manipulating ClO2. In fact, Com-
bourieu and Moreau prepared the gaseous ClO2 in the dark by the re-
action of concentrated sulfuric acid on potassium chlorate, and
Combourieu et al. mentioned that simultaneous condensation of
ammonia and chlorine in a liquid nitrogen trap downstream of the low-
pressure burner can create violent explosions (due to the presence of
nitrogen trichloride, NCl3), therefore stringent precautions to prevent
dramatic complications were mandatory in these literature works.

4.2.2. ClO2/NH3: theoretical flame temperatures

Interestingly, Combourieu et al. provide the theoretical flame tem-
peratures of ClO2/NH3 at 100 torr [193]. This parameter provides a
good opportunity to verify if the two models from Gross [39] and Chen
and McQuaid [50] compute the flame temperatures at equilibrium in a
similar manner. Fig. 36 illustrates their results, with the predictions
matching the flame temperatures from Combourieu et al. very well.

Agreement amongst the models in calculated flame temperature is
not surprising and is expected. Any disagreement would be attributed to
differences in the thermodynamics data for the species. To further
explore the ability of the mechanisms to predict the flame temperatures
for common ingredients, four typical mixtures based on results pre-
sented in this review were tested with the three models. Mix A represents

is an example of realistic AP decomposition conditions.

atm [102–113].

4) Mix D: AP (NH3:HClO4) at 298 K for pressures: 1, 10, and 100 atm

In the four different cases presented in Table 4, the Giovangigli et al.
systematically have identical

[39] models

temperatures at equilibrium. The Chen and McQuaid model remains the
same for Mix B, but shows temperature differences of ±2 K, ±16 K, and
±10 K for Mix A, Mix C, and Mix D, respectively.

4.2.3. ClO2/N2: induction periods

McHale and von Elbe observed the explosive characteristics of ClO2
over a pressure and temperature range of 0.2–20 torr and 327–407 K,
respectively [191]. After a modeling investigation, the Gross model [39]
uniquely converges to a solution and shows reasonable agreement for
pure ClO2, 15 torr in Fig. 37 (a). On the contrary, a very high divergence
is seen for ClO2 in N2 at all the experimental conditions available in this
study, as in Fig. 37 (b). In the same line, Jin et al. tested ClO2 in air
[192], and there is a large, three orders of magnitude difference between
the experiments and the Gross model [39], reported in Table 5.

4.3. Chlorine kinetics

4.3.1. Cl2/H2 in Ar using a shock tube: ignition delay times

Lastly, ignition delay times of Cl2/H2 mixtures in 0.68–0.79 Ar are
presented in this section. Lifshitz and Schechner [194] carried out py-
rolysis experiments at pressures from 1 to 4.6 atm, temperatures from
780 to 1260 K, and Cl2 mole fractions from 0.1 to 0.216. The Gross [39]
and Giovangigli et al. [37] models were able to predict these data within
a reasonable time frame; however, the Chen and McQuaid model [50]
did not predict any ignition delay times, as visible in Fig. 38. The Gross
[39] model over-predicts the ignition delay times, and the Giovangigli
et al. [37] model is extremely under-reactive, with predicted ignition
delay times that are 47 times longer than the experimental data. No neat
mixtures focusing on Cl2 were found in the literature, to the best of the
authors’ knowledge.

It was found that the reaction H + H + M ⇆ H2 + M (R28) is missing
from the mechanism of Chen and McQuaid [50], which disables the
overall functioning and hidden secondary-step key reactions, such as
R29 and R30.

H + H + M ⇆ H2 + M

Cl + Cl + M ⇆ Cl2 + M

H + HCl ⇆ Cl + H2

(R28)

(R29)

(R30)

The addition of these three reactions (R28-R29-R30) within the Chen
and McQuaid model enables the ignition delay times of Cl2 to be
modeled, as visible in Fig. 39 (a). The results show predictions that are
close to the Gross model, suggesting that these three above-mentioned
R28, R29, and R30 reactions are among the most significant ones to
describe the pyrolysis of the H2/Cl2 system in Ar. The reactions R28-30
are already implemented in the Giovangigli et al. model, however R29
and R30 have very different reaction rates, mostly coming from the
parameter A in the Arrhenius equation. Therefore, the reactions R29 and
R30 were replaced in the model with the rate constants from the Gross
model, and the results in Fig. 39 (b) depict significant improvement for
the Giovangigli et al. model when compared with its performance in
Fig. 38.

4.3.2. Cl2/H2 in Ar using a flat flame: speciation

Vandooren et al. [197] studied the structure of one rich premixed flat
flame of 0.35 H2/0.23 Cl2 in 0.42 Ar at low pressure (42 torr) and 298 K.
The speciation of H2, Cl2, and HCl was possible using a MBMS technique.
Numerical predictions are commonly shifted, e.g. 1 mm in Pelucchi et al.

[225], to match the initial downstream mole fraction of the study. While
the Chen and McQuaid model [50] did not converge to a solution, the
Gross [39], and Giovangigli et al. [37] models give profiles with a shift
of 8.5 mm and 43 mm, respectively. The Gross model agrees well with
the data (Fig. 40 (a)), but the Giovangigli et al. model does not repro-
duce these speciation measurements with much accuracy in Fig. 40 (b).
Again, the Chen and McQuaid model modified with the addition of R28,
R29, and R30 estimates H2, Cl2 and HCl correctly with a shift of 8.7 mm,
as can be seen in Fig. 41 (a). Similarly, the Giovangigli et al. model +
R29 + R30 shows better results in Fig. 41 (b).

4.3.3. Cl2/H2 in N2 using a combustion chamber: laminar flame speeds

Cl2/H2 mixtures in 0.45–0.6 N2 have been experimentally investi-
gated as well for laminar flame speeds. Corbeels and Scheller [195] and
Leylegian et al. [196] studied Cl2 in 0.45–0.5 N2 and 0.5–0.6 N2,
respectively. These experiments were performed under the following
conditions: P = 1 atm, T = 298 K, and Cl2 mole fractions from 0.16 to
0.28. Interestingly, Cl2/H2 in 0.5 N2 data were obtained from both
Corbeels and Scheller [195] and Leylegian et al. [196], but Fig. 42
demonstrates large differences in the flame speeds’ values between these
two studies. One can observe that this divergence could be the conse-
quences of the experimental procedure applied; i.e. a burner tube versus
a counterflow twin-flame. The Gross model [39] is visible in Fig. 42 and
is underpredicting the laminar flame speeds. On the contrary, Chen and
McQuaid [50] is limited by the H2 chemistry and did not converge to a
solution; however, the Chen and McQuaid model + R28 + R29 + R30
gives laminar flame speeds slightly below the results from the Gross
model. Furthermore, the Giovangigli et al. [37] model cannot be rep-
resented in Fig. 42 due to its lack of performance, even with the addition
of R29 and R30. Further investigation is needed in the submechanism of
Cl2, and Pelucchi et al. presented 61 reactions for the chlorine subset
that may need to be examined in future work to identify the missing key
reactions [225].

5. Toward a comprehensive AP mechanism

In this section, some detailed discussion and analysis are presented,
with emphasis on summarizing the state of AP chemical kinetics and on
what the community should focus on in future work. We first discuss the
ammonia kinetics modeling, followed by the perchloric acid kinetics. A
recently developed AP mechanism, based on a similar approach to that
outlined herein, is then discussed in light of the past and future di-
rections on AP kinetics modeling. As a capstone analysis, this recent AP

sensitivity and reaction pathway analyses for ammonia oxidation, to
serve as guides for identifying important reactions for continued
consideration.

5.1.1. Advancements in ammonia kinetics modeling

Table SM15 in the Supplementary Material summarizes the extensive
effort for the NH3 modeling from the chemical kinetics community over
the past several years along with the experimental targets used to vali-
date the models’ performance [73,80,87,97,98,101–117,157,158,162,
169,170,172,173,175,178,180,181,206,214–221,226–319]. At the time
of this article, the status of ammonia combustion research is so rapidly
advancing that the reader should use this table only as a starting point
and be aware of future improvements which will likely be available
shortly after the date of this publication.

It is beyond the scope of this paper to extensively discuss and
compare the models, but it is provided as a resource in the Supple-
mentary Material for future researchers to use in the formulation of an
AP kinetics model. With regard to the NH3-related analyses and

model is used to predict the important reactions and reaction pathways
for a mixture of NH3 and HClO4, so that the cross chemistry between the
two sub-mechanisms could be highlighted for future focus. Lastly, some
comments summarizing the future direction for AP kinetics develop-
ment and some words on HTPB kinetics are provided.

5.1. NH3 kinetics modeling

As previously mentioned, there has been significant activity in recent
years on NH3 combustion. Activity has included the generation of
fundamental chemical kinetics data, the improvement of kinetics
models, and ultimately applications of ammonia and NH3/fuel blends in
flames and combustors. Of interest to the present paper is the progress
made in the understanding of ammonia combustion chemistry and the
parallel development of chemical kinetics mechanisms. A brief summary
of the many available mechanisms to date is provided below, with the
intent for the community to take advantage of this progress in NH3
combustion chemistry with an eye toward the ammonia sub-mechanism
(s) in a comprehensive AP model. Also provided in this subsection are

comparisons presented above, the Mathieu and Petersen study from
2015 [73] offers strong validation targets that have been used by many
of the most-updated models for fine tuning for almost a decade. It
therefore seemed fair to the authors to use their own model for com-
parisons with AP mechanisms in the present paper, as even an “early”
mechanism from 2015 predicts ammonia chemistry better than the
existing AP models. Basically, any of the recent models would show
similar results when compared to the available AP mechanisms. Of
course, again, these prior AP modelers did not have access to such
ammonia chemistry data and reaction rate improvements, so poor
agreement with those AP models is not unexpected. In fact, advances in
NH3 chemistry have already been used to generate a next-generation AP
model over the past year, which is the subject of Section 5.3.

5.1.2. Ammonia sensitivity and reaction pathway analyses

One important application of a kinetics model is that it can be used to
analyze a combustion system to assess the primary reaction pathways
and to identify the rates to which parameters such as IDT and laminar
flame speed are most sensitive. Such analyses can then be used to
identify the reactions that are most critical for further study and
improvement of individual rate coefficients, toward the betterment of
the overall mechanism. We have performed such analyses for ammonia
flames taken from the available database discussed above. The results in
themselves help to show the important reactions in ammonia oxidation
in a N/H/O environment, and in general it serves as an example for the
process moving forward in the development of a final AP mechanism.
Certainly, additional analyses would be appropriate for a system where
chlorine-based species are present, as broached in Section 5.4.

Using the Gross AP model, Fig. 43 shows the most sensitive reactions
for NH3 flames in air at 1 atm and 298 K, in correspondence with Fig. 13,
for three different equivalence ratios, ɸ = 0.7, 1.0, and 1.3. The major
reaction is of course H + O2 ⇆ O + OH (R31), closely followed by the
reactions NH3 + OH ⇆ NH2 + H2O (R32) and NH + OH ⇆ H2 + NO
(R33). The main outcome of this plot is that the flame sensitivity is
affected by several competing reactions and some nonlinear de-
pendences on equivalence ratio. For example, the reaction (R32) pro-
motes the flame speed at lean conditions. On the contrary, the sensitivity
coefficient reaches the value of (cid:0) 0.48 for ɸ = 1.3; as in rich conditions,
the combustion is lacking of oxygen, therefore of OH radicals available
to react with NH3. Similarly, it is observed that a few reactions linearly
increase in sensitivity when the equivalence ratio increases, such as: NH
+ OH ⇆ H2 + NO (R33), NH + OH ⇆ H2O + N (R34), NO + H + M ⇆
HNO + M (R35), and N2H2 + NO ⇆ N2O + NH2 (R36). Conversely, the
sensitivity decreases when the equivalence ratio increases for the re-
actions NH2 + O2 ⇆ HNO + OH (R37), NH2 + NO ⇆ H2O + N2 (R7), NH
+ NH2 ⇆ N + NH3 (R38), and NH + NO ⇆ N2+ OH (R39). The two

reactions NH + NO ⇆ H + N2 + O (R40) and N2O + H ⇆ N2 + OH (R41)
are also important for ammonia laminar flame speeds.

After further examination, the Giovangigli et al. and Chen and
McQuaid models were missing 19% and 76% of the reactions presented
in Fig. 43, where eight reactions involved NH in the latter one. Fig. 44
shows the major reactions (R31, R37, and others (NH2 + O ⇆ H + HNO
(R4), and R42-44), also visible in Fig. 43) that experience a significant
reduction over the complete range of equivalence ratio, leading to the
29% decrease in the laminar flame speeds, observed in Fig. 13.

(R44)

It is noteworthy to mention that a sensitivity analysis will not help to
fully understand what is missing in the mechanisms, even in the Gross
model that converged to solution. Of course, the results of a sensitivity
analysis are limited to what is already in a given model. If a major re-
action were missing in the model, making the predictions poor, then this
reaction will not show up during the sensitivity analysis, making the
analysis somewhat irrelevant in such a case. Revisiting the sensitivity
analyses is necessary once improved versions of an AP mechanisms are
available.

Additionally, Fig. 45 presents a comparison for reaction pathways
using the same analytical procedure from Fig. R6 and involving two
mechanisms used in this study, the Giovangigli et al. [37] and Mathieu
and Petersen [73] models, applied to the experimental conditions from
Mathieu and Petersen (2100 K, 1 atm, and ɸ = 1.0). Besides the path-
ways giving N2H2 and N2H3 for Giovangigli et al., the overall reaction
channels NH3 → NH2 → NH and sub-mechanisms seem similar. How-
ever, the distribution of each reaction flux is drastically disparate, which
creates unbalanced proportions of species and radicals taking place
during the NH3 combustion, hence responsible of the difference in
performance between these two mechanisms where the Mathieu and
Petersen model predicts the NH3 results with much higher accuracy.

5.2. HClO4 kinetics modeling

As eluded to several times prior, the state of perchloric acid chemical
kinetics is not as strong as for ammonia, based on the low level of ac-
tivity in the literature and the limited kinetics data that are available. To
further examine the important elementary chemical reactions for
perchloric acid combustion, the Gross model was used in a sensitivity
analysis, based on existing HClO4 flame experiments. Such a sensitivity
analysis can be used as a starting point to focus on the key reactions in a
modern HClO4 sub-mechanism.

To this end, the burning velocities of HClO4 in Fig. 34 were analyzed
to obtain the sensitivity coefficients for key reactions. Nine reactions can
be reported and are depicted in Fig. 46. As one can see, the addition of
N2 has a small influence on the sensitive reactions, with the reaction
HClO4 ⇆ ClO3 + OH (R23) exhibiting the largest impact overall, plus a
growth of 16% between yN2 = 0.48 and 1.9. Interestingly, only a few
intermediate species are needed in the combustion of HClO4 (mainly Cl
and HCl), but admittingly the relevant reactions are not well represented
by any of the mechanisms presented herein.

The effect of methane when added in the system HClO4-2.17H2O-N2
is compared by replacing 50% of the HClO4 with CH4, and the results are
illustrated in Fig. 47. Eight reactions are shared between the two sys-
tems, and the reactions ClO + O ⇆ Cl + O2 (R45), HCl + O ⇆ Cl + OH
(R46), Cl + HO2 ⇆ HCl + O2 (R47), and HCl + OH ⇆ Cl + H2O (R48), as
well as (R23) were also quite sensitive in Fig. 46. The sensitivities of
three reactions were notably increased thanks to CH4 sub-mechanisms,
namely 2 OH ⇆ H2O + O (R49), HCl + HO2 ⇆ ClO + H2O (R50), and

(R31), accelerating a burning velocity of 5 cm/s to an extremely rapid
velocity of 158 cm/s.

The above reactions in the HClO4 system could serve as a good
starting set of important reactions to study when assembling an updated
HClO4 sub-mechanism. A closer look at the existing rates, with an
emphasis on the most-important ones such as HClO4 ⇆ ClO4 + OH and 2
Cl + M ⇆ Cl2 + M, among others, is needed. Improvements can be made

through new measurements of the rate coefficients at high temperatures,
coupled with theoretical estimates when appropriate. Targeted kinetics
data of the types discussed in this paper should be generated to use as
validation for the next-generation HClO4 kinetics model.

While recent NH3 work can immediately help in identifying missing
reactions, the HClO4 chemistry is sorely lacking of gas-phase experi-
ments, see Fig. 4; therefore, an entire study to uncover the missing re-
actions for HClO4 has never been explored before, and this review paper
is claiming the need of new measurements for HClO4 and the charac-
terization of the sequence HClO4 → ClO3 → ClO → Cl → HCl → Cl2, as
well as HClO4-CxHy interactions for AP/HTPB applications.

5.3. Recent progress on AP mechanism development

A revised model of ammonium perchlorate combustion is now
available in the literature: Bernigaud et al. proposed a model for AP,
leveraging solely the recent advances in the modeling of ammonia and
NOx chemistry [320]. While the experimental database collected key
test cases to validate the mechanism, Bernigaud et al. highlighted that
the solid propellant community rarely used them, as Sections 3 and 4
aimed to demonstrate; therefore, they stated that no significant revision
or improvement was seen in more than a decade, in line with our own
observations. Fig. 48 (a–j) shows the performance of the new Bernigaud
et al. model compared with the Mathieu and Petersen chemical detailed
kinetics mechanism using a representative sample of experimental data
from the ammonia investigation section.

The NH3 profile in Fig. 48 (a) shows that the updated mechanism
accelerates the NH3 decomposition (note that the work from Alturaifi

et al. presented a list of 47 reactions capable of reproducing the NH3
time histories with high accuracy from the entire set of experiments).
Consequently, the ignition delay times obtained in highly diluted con-
ditions in Fig. 48 (b) are underpredicted by Bernigaud et al., and the
solid gray lines represent the numerical predictions found within their
work. The differences between the new modeling results (the dashed-
double-dot lines) from the authors and the solid gray lines come from
the discrepancies in the IDT definition: Bernigaud et al. seem to
extrapolate the IDTs using the max-to-peak OH* timing, while Mathieu
and Petersen presented their definition of IDTs as the intersection of the
‘steepest rate-of-change’ of OH* and the zero-concentration level lines.
Conversely, excellent agreement was denoted for the NH2 and NH pro-
files in Fig. 48 (c) and (d), respectively.

Fig. 48 (e) illustrates the performance from the Bernigaud et al.
model on IDTs of NH3 in air at high pressure (40 atm), which is not
satisfactory at these conditions. The laminar flame speed results were
greatly improved when compared to Gross model; however, both pre-
dictions from the two models in Fig. 48 (f) still show poor predictions of
the laminar flame speed compared with results from twelve studies.
Lastly, speciation in jet-stirred reactors, see Fig. 48 (g–j), deserve some
more attention for better improvements overall.

Similarly, Fig. 49, Table 6, and Fig. 50 summarize experimental
measurements constituting a good representation of the perchloric acid
results available in the literature that fit the methodology to finely tune
the reaction mechanisms. Note that results in Fig. 50 were the only
targeted perchloric acid data assembled to improve the model in Ber-
nigaud et al. In Fig. 49 (a), the unique flame speeds for HClO4, 2.17 H2O
in N2 are compared with the Gross and Bernigaud et al. models: it

appears that the values from the latter one are very similar to the Chen
and McQuaid mechanism with the addition of the reaction R25 (see
Fig. 34), significantly below the 2.5 cm/s for the full range of N2 con-
centrations. For the speciation of Cl2, H2, and HCl from Vandooren et al.,
shown in Fig. 50 (b), a modern Cl-related reaction mechanism from
Pelucchi et al. [321] and the Gross model are included as references. The
Bernigaud et al. mechanism behaves like the Pelucchi et al. model,
which surprisingly is somewhat worse than the Gross mechanism.

The following results focus on ClO2 laminar flame speeds and in-
duction periods, where no improvement/change is observed between
the Gross and Bernigaud et al. mechanisms. Nevertheless, the lack of
new data for the perchloric acid chemistry leads to almost-impossible
development and amelioration of any mechanisms. There is an urgent
need of new experimental measurements to tackle the HClO4 sub-
mechanisms.

Lastly, fundamental global kinetics data, namely ignition delay times
and laminar flame speeds, for H2/Cl2 systems are shown in Fig. 50 (a)
and (b), respectively. Reasonably good results are obtained for IDTs with
both models, similar to the Gross mechanism, see Fig. 38, and improved
numerical predictions were gained for LFS.

In summary, the recent work of Bernigaud et al. in producing an
updated AP chemical kinetics mechanism represents the first test case
for the approach that is being championed by the present authors
throughout this review. That is, an updated AP mechanism should be
produced using recent chemical kinetics modeling (and data) for the
nitrogen-based chemistry. A similar update is needed for
the
perchlorate-based chemistry, but new, fundamental data and updated
chemical kinetics modeling are required for the HClO4 sub-mechanism
before any real improvements can be made. The Bernigaud et al. work
shows the benefits of incorporating improved ammonia chemistry, but
the final AP mechanism from that study is still relatively weak for the Cl/
H/O-based chemical kinetics. One important segment of the chemical
kinetics space is the interaction between the N/H/O system and the Cl/
H/O system, for which there are even fewer data and much less focus,
despite their potential importance to the overall AP combustion mech-
anism. This topic is addressed in the next section.

5.4. Nitrogen/chlorine/hydrogen reactions

Of high importance—but with relatively little study from the kinetics
community—are fundamental data and kinetics modeling of the com-
bined NH3-HClO4 system. A starting gas-phase mixture of these two
should be an ideal starting point for mimicking the AP combustion

chemistry. To this end, the chemistry of AP flames was investigated by
carrying out a sensitivity and rate-of-production analysis on the HClO4-
NH3 system at 293 K and two pressures: 1 and 15 atm. The analysis was
possible by monitoring the key intermediate species ClO, so that the
reactions involved during the perchloric acid combustion along with its
interactions with ammonia would be highlighted.

With the challenges to obtain solutions for HClO4 and NH3 from
previous data, the numerical predictions for the HClO4-NH3 system were
performed using the more-recent AP mechanism of Bernigaud et al.
[320]. Fig. 51 shows that despite the change of pressures, the same top
eight sensitive reactions can be reported. Amongst these 8 reactions, six
are clear interactions between the two very different chemistries of
either HClO4 or NH3. For instance, HClO4 reacts with the intermediate
species from NH3, such as NH2 and NH (HClO4 + NH2 ⇌ H2O + HNO +
ClO2 (R51); HClO4 + NH ⇌ ClO2 + HNO + OH (R52)) as well as HNO
and NO that contain the nitrogen from ammonia and the oxygen from
HClO4. The parent species NH3 also reacts with ClO, such as NH3 + ClO
⇌ NH2 + ClOH (R53), where ClOH provides more chlorine in-
termediates (ClO and HCl, more on that later). Note that the results at 1
atm exhibit the reaction ClO + NH2 ⇌ HNO + HCl (R54) that does not
appear at 15 atm (vice versa for H2NO + NO2 ⇌ HNO + HONO (R55)).
Hence, even from this first attempt at analyzing the combined chemis-
try, the impact of elevated pressure can be seen to alter the important
chemical reactions.

HClO4 + NH2 ⇌ H2O + HNO + ClO2

HClO4 + NH ⇌ ClO2 + HNO + OH

NH3 + ClO ⇌ NH2 + ClOH

ClO + NH2 ⇌ HNO + HCl

H2NO + NO2 ⇌ HNO + HONO

(R55)

Note that the reactions R51 and R52 are likely not elementary re-
actions and should not be written as reversible. The probability of three
molecules colliding at an instant is very low (less than 0.1 % of the
probability of two particles colliding [322]): 1) achieving the necessary
energy distribution is difficult, hence trimolecular reactions are not the
preferred path; 2) the activation energy is generally higher, which
promote bimolecular reaction with lower activation barriers; and 3)
there are some spatial arrangement constraints.

Fig. 52 presents the rate-of-production results obtained for the
HClO4-NH3 system, with a focus on ClO. The first five reactions reported

34

in Fig. 52 illustrates how ClO is consumed to give the following in-
termediates: Cl, HCl, Cl2, and ClOH. Moreover, the presence of NO,
HNO, NH2, and NH3 allows the formation of unique species that would
not have been encountered without NH3 in the system, namely NO2.
Additionally, the last four reactions provide insight on the main for-
mation of ClO from ClO3 ⇌ ClO + O2 (R24), ClOH + OH ⇌ ClO + H2O
(R56), HCl + HO2 ⇌ ClO + H2O (R50), and HClO4 + NO ⇌ ClO + NO2 +
HO2 (R57). Overall, 56% of the reactions presented in Fig. 52 are
directly impacted by the combination of NH3 with HClO4.

ClOH + OH ⇌ ClO + H2O

HClO4 + NO ⇌ ClO + NO2 + HO2

(R56)

(R57, forward)

Finally, Fig. 53 summarizes the reaction pathway analysis with the
help of earlier sensitivity and rate-of-production analyses. As one can
see, the decomposition of HClO4 and NH3 via the sequences HClO4 →
ClO3 → ClO → HCl → Cl and NH3 → NH2 → NH are depicted with red and
blue lines, respectively. The interactions between HClO4 and NH3 are
represented with the active radical species using the same color code,
namely red and blue, respectively, e.g., NO, Cl, and ClO, as well as some
specific species products, such as NO2, HCl, and more importantly ClOH.
It is noteworthy to emphasize the reaction (R53) again here, as it is
enhancing the ClO, HCl, and Cl2 opportunities to increase during the
HClO4-NH3 combustion. Furthermore, the pressure effect observed on
the reactions (R53), (R24), and (R50), as well as HCl-related reactions is
significant.

The analysis in this section demonstrates the critical need for further
studies to validate the aspects of the combustion chemistry where inter-
system reactions comprise a significant percentage of the important
reactions and reaction pathways. The rate coefficients currently being
used in the latest AP mechanisms require closer review in light of any
recent developments with regard to measured or calculated rates. The
most-important reactions should be identified and re-assessed, and
fundamental chemical kinetics data using well-designed initial condi-
tions and mixtures are required for model validation—both for
improving individual reaction rates and in optimizing the larger mech-
anism. Intermediate species such as Cl, HCl, NO, NH, NH2, OH, and NO2
are just as important in the cross-system kinetics (Figs. 51–53) as they
are for the individual NH3 and HClO4 sub-mechanism chemistry (Sec-
tions 5.1 and 5.2).

5.5. Challenges and future prospects for AP kinetics modeling

From the results outlined in the previous section, one can conclude
that, except for a few specific cases, none of the AP kinetics models prior
to 2023 can adequately simulate the types of fundamental data that are
normally utilized by the combustion kinetics community to build and
validate detailed kinetics mechanisms. While for some cases a particular
model is able to predict experimental results to a reasonable level of
accuracy, that same model might be unable to provide results for a
different type of data or different range of conditions. Given the
importance of AP as a widely used oxidizer in composite propellants and
as a monopropellant on its own, an updated chemical kinetics mecha-
nism that describes its high-temperature, gas-phase chemistry is defi-
nitely needed. However, the prior sections do more than just point out
deficiencies in the existing mechanisms—they provide a methodology
and a starting database of fundamental kinetics data that can be used for
future validation while also demonstrating the usefulness of
the
approach in vetting the high-temperature oxidation chemistry of AP
decomposition products, NH3 and HClO4.

An updated mechanism for ammonium perchlorate could be
approached by considering it to be a combination of three sub-
mechanisms that center on the 1) ammonia-related chemistry, 2)
perchloric acid-related chemistry, and 3) well-established hydrogen
chemistry. One can take advantage of the considerable work that has
been done to date on these sub-mechanisms, namely the H2 and NH3

branches. A good example for a hydrogen sub-mechanism that has been
fully developed over a range of fundamental kinetics data is that of
K ́eromn`es et al. [57]. As mentioned above, there has been much activity
in the past few years with respect to ammonia chemical kinetics, and
several possible models could be used as a starting point for an NH3
sub-mechanism (or, more broadly, a general mechanism for nitrogen
species, including NOx chemistry). Some examples include the models of
Mathieu and Petersen [73], Otomo et al. [206], and Alturaifi et al. [97].
The recent work of Bernigaud et al. used this approach very recently,
with much success.

Concerning ammonia, despite the flurry of kinetics studies and sig-
nificant progress made over the past five years alone, recent results
suggest that much work remains to be done. In general, global kinetics
data such as ignition delay time [119,323,324] and laminar flame speed
[119,324,325] are now well predicted, and the latest models also
manage to capture the results of most speciation studies relatively well
[323,324,326,327]. On the other hand, recent work from our group has
shown that time-history profiles of various species during ammonia
pyrolysis (NH3) [97] and combustion (NH3, H2O, N2O) [317,318] were
poorly predicted by most (if not all) models, showing that considerable
room for improvement remains. As a result, it is the authors’ opinion
that, to better validate ammonia models, time histories of key radicals
such as NH2 and NH need to be measured. Indeed, since the number of
stable species to measure during ammonia combustion is much smaller
than for hydrocarbons [123], being able to experimentally follow —and
then numerically predict— the formation and consumption of reactive
species like radicals during combustion would allow for a significantly
higher level of constraint for the models, leading to more accurate
predictions once these results are used to validate the models. Ab-initio
calculations for reactions involving these key radicals would also be
helpful, with the understanding that radical-radical reactions are prob-
ably still too challenging from a theoretical and computing power
standpoint.

Suitable sub-mechanisms for the perchloric acid branch and Cl-based
chemistry in general will need to be identified from the literature. Based
on the results in Fig. 4, there are much fewer existing data sets for cal-
ibrating the HClO4 chemistry at combustion conditions, and it is likely
that any available sub-mechanism would need to be further vetted using
new data. Interactions between the HClO4-related species and the
nitrogen-based species could also be important to AP combustion
chemistry, and ultimately a comprehensive mechanism would include
such elementary reactions and corresponding rate coefficients. These
types of reactions are (likely) not as well studied or have been consid-
ered at all within the more-developed chemical kinetics of the main sub-
mechanisms.

While the reaction rates and corresponding rate coefficients of
elementary reactions have been the primary focus of this article and in
the AP mechanism validation and future development discussions, one
cannot ignore the thermodynamic and transport database for the species
involved in the chemical reactions. One can argue that the thermo and
transport data for the species in the hydrogen and nitrogen-based sub-
mechanisms are reasonably well known at present, as a result of
extensive scrutiny within the combustion kinetics community. However,
it is likely that the Cl-based species are not as developed over the
applicable temperature range needed for combustion applications. Some
targeted research into the related thermo and transport database for Cl-
based species is warranted.

Validation of an updated AP kinetics mechanism will of course need
to come from fundamental data, some of which are assembled above.
However, much more data are needed, particularly at elevated pressures
and for vetting the high-temperature oxidation chemistry of the HClO4-
sub-mechanism. In contrast, there is arguably a large variety of data
available to vet the ammonia chemistry. Such data both new and old
should include shock-tube experiments (ignition delay times, stable
species concentrations, and species time histories). Species of interest
would include, in addition to the parent NH3 and HClO4 molecules,

35

C.M. Gr ́egoire et al.

species such as NH, NH2, HCl, Cl2, ClO2, and OH; as well as final
products like H2O, NO, and NO2. Complementary data from RCMs at
lower temperatures (<1000 K) are also necessary, as are laminar flame
speeds over a range of stoichiometry and initial conditions. Additional
validation should come from canonical reactor-based experiments like
speciation from JSRs and laboratory flames. Finally, data from these
same fundamental experiments but starting with mixtures containing
both nitrogen and Cl-containing species (rather than from single-
component mixtures) could be used to test the final mechanism over
initial mixtures and conditions that begin to approach those seen in an
AP flame.

5.6. Consideration of HTPB chemistry

In many aspects, modern chemical kinetics mechanisms for hydro-
carbons are much more developed than the oxidation chemistry of NH3
and HClO4 considered in this paper. At their core, robust kinetics
mechanisms for hydrocarbon fuels are rooted in H2 and CH4 chemistry,
which has been very well studied over the past few decades [62,84,328].
As a result, we anticipate that assembling a draft model for HTPB
combustion can be accomplished without rigorous background study by
relying on the large body of existing work already available in the
literature. For example, the 1,3 butadiene kinetics mechanism published
by Zhou et al. in 2018 [81] is based on a wide-ranging dataset by several
research groups and includes a number of different experimental tech-
niques. The new data in the Zhou et al. work focused on 1,3 butadiene
oxidation over a range of pressures up to 40 atm and temperatures be-
tween 600 and 1600 K, while the modeling built upon the C1-C4
chemical kinetics mechanisms previously generated by the University
of Galway group over a number of years (i.e., AramcoMech 2.0). This
detailed reaction mechanism for C4 species contains 3037 elementary
reactions and 581 species. Hence, one would expect the complete,
detailed HTPB sub-mechanism for modeling composite propellant
combustion would be of similar or larger size.

Ultimately, a modern, detailed mechanism for HTPB should be
combined with a detailed one for AP to allow for the modeling of
composite AP/HTPB propellants burning in the gaseous phase. Such a
combined mechanism should then in turn be validated with funda-
mental kinetics data that are based on mixtures of NH3, HClO4, H2, and
hydrocarbons in various combinations. Such data would be from the
same types of experiments as those presented and utilized above, such as
shock tubes, RCMs, flames, and reactors. Sensitivity analyses using the
combined model will identify the reactions and reaction pathways that
emerge as being important for the AP/HTPB system at realistic condi-
tions and mixtures. Basic understanding and avenues for further im-
provements of the detailed chemistry will result.

While the two fully validated sub-mechanisms should, when com-
bined, provide reasonably accurate simulations of composite propellant
combustion chemistry, the community would need to determine the
effect of
interactions between: 1) NH3 (and nitrogen-based in-
termediates) and hydrocarbons, and 2) perchloric acid (and Cl-based
compounds) and hydrocarbons. For example, binary reactions be-
tween NOx and key hydrocarbons should be considered. Since the C4
base hydrocarbons are known to break down quickly into C2 compounds
such as acetylene and ethylene [329], reactions such as NO2 + C2H4,
N2O + C2H2, ClO2 + C2H4, and HCl + C2H2, etc., are all potential can-
didates for future study. Theoretical modeling and shock tubes would be
ideal for obtaining the required rate coefficients. Shock-tube experi-
ments would be designed to isolate these reactions and make direct
measurements of their rate coefficients, concentrating on those that are
found to be more important on driving the AP/HTPB chemistry.

[50] models) were carefully evaluated against a meaningful experi-
mental database containing NH3-, N2O-, and NOx-related measure-
ments, but also via HClO4-, ClO2-, and Cl2-related measurements. It is
suggested that the experimental database assembled in Table 2 is only
useful for the calibration of overall propellant burning rate from
multi-physics models. To summarize, none of the three models can
accurately simulate the type of chemical kinetics data assembled herein,
aside from some particular cases. For example, the NH3 pyrolysis at high
temperature (>2700 K) studied in Davidson et al. [98] provides NH2
profiles that the Giovangigli et al. [37] model reproduces with good
agreement. Similarly, the Giovangigli et al. model agrees with N2O py-
rolysis measurements from Mulvihill et al. [164] with acceptable ac-
curacy. Finally, the Gross model predicts the HClO4 flame speeds from
Combourieu et al. [182] and the production of H2, Cl2, and HCl mole
fractions of a premixed H2/Cl2 flat flame at room temperature found in
Vandooren et al. [197]. Because of the lack of comprehensive validation,
one can conclude that the available mechanisms for AP gas-phase
combustion serve as good starting points, but relative to the state of
the art
in current combustion chemistry remain only marginally
acceptable. Moreover, the lack of experiments for HClO4 and its inter-
mediate species is also of concern (52+ studies for NH3 and its
sub-species versus 12 in total for HClO4, ClO2, and Cl2). It was shown as
an example that modern ammonia sub-mechanisms (as seen in Fig. 16)
can certainly provide the level of precision expected in this field.

Importantly, various reactions are highlighted to significantly
improve the models’ performance: the addition of the reactions (R2) and
(R3) for NH3 pyrolysis, (R19) and (R20) for NOx-related experiments,
(R25) for HClO4 laminar flame speeds, and the sequence (R29), (R30),
and (R31) for H2/Cl2 systems. Additionally, modification of the rate
coefficients of (R15) using N2O time histories during its pyrolysis also
indicate the need to investigate direct measurements of reaction rates
whenever possible. From the results of sensitivity and reaction pathway
analysis for the combustion of a combined mixture of NH3 and HClO4, it
was shown that cross-system reactions are extremely important for
modeling AP kinetics. Such reactions between N/H/O and Cl/H/O
species require future study, including the assembly of a relevant
chemical kinetics experimental database. New data from the literature
and advances in experimental diagnostics and facilities should be uti-
lized in the continuous development of a detailed AP kinetics mecha-
nism. Subsequent improvements in the AP kinetics modeling, and
ultimately for AP/HTPB, will greatly increase the community’s confi-
dence in predicting the effects of gas-phase chemistry within the larger
framework of burning rate simulations for composite propellants.

Claire Marie Gr ́egoire is a doctoral researcher in the J. Mike
Walker ‘66 Department of Mechanical Engineering at Texas
A&M University within the Turbomachinery Laboratory under
the supervision of Prof. Petersen. Her research entails the
experimental study of combustion processes. Her Ph.D. work
focused on combustion chemistry, with projects on pentene
isomers and lithium-ion battery electrolytes, with laser
methods that enable insight into the complex and detailed ki-
netic modeling. The development of a HCl laser absorption
diagnostic to investigate the combustion kinetics of solid rocket
propellants was her final thesis’ project. Her Ph.D. work has led
to the publication of 22 peer-reviewed scientific articles, and
she is firmly determined to continue contributing to the

Mike Walker ‘66 Department of Mechanical Engineering at
Texas A&M University. He received his Ph.D. in Physical
Chemistry from the University of Orl ́eans, France, in 2006,
following an M.Sc. from the University of Pierre and Marie
Curie, Paris, in 2003. Dr. Mathieu developed expertise in
combustion chemistry starting from his M.Sc., through various
positions at IFP Energies Nouvelles (France) and Saudi Aramco
(Saudi Arabia), before joining Texas A&M University in 2011.
His research encompasses multiple aspects of combustion
chemistry, including pollutant formation (soot, NOx, SOx),
fuels for energy production (hydrogen, ammonia, syngas, nat-
ural gas), and transportation (gasoline, jet, and diesel fuels).
His work also covers related topics such as the thermal destruction of chemical weapons of
mass destruction, fire suppressants, and the combustion properties of lithium-ion battery
electrolytes. He has authored over 90 peer-reviewed journal articles, 100 conference pa-
pers, one book chapter, and one book on those topics.

Joseph Kalman is currently an associate professor of mechan-
ical and aerospace engineering at California State University,
Long Beach where he has been since 2018. He received his
bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Rutgers University in
2008 and 2010, respectively. His Ph.D. was awarded from the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2014. All three
degrees are in mechanical engineering. Following graduate
school, Dr. Kalman was previously the lead researcher in the
Combustion Sciences Lab within the Combustion Science and
Propulsion Research Branch at the Naval Air Warfare Center
Weapons Division-China Lake. His research is primarily moti-
vated by solid propulsion applications and focuses on aspects of
multiphase combustion and energetic materials with an
emphasis on applying non-intrusive diagnostics to these challenging systems and envi-
ronments. Dr. Kalman has published 28 peer-reviewed articles and over 50 conference
papers on those topics.

Dr. Eric Petersen is presently a Professor and holder of the
Nelson-Jackson Chair in the J. Mike Walker ‘66 Department of
