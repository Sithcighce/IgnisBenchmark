Progress in recent years has opened the door for yet another area of application for the lattice Boltzmann
method: Combustion simulations. Combustion is known to be a challenge for numerical tools due to, among
many other reasons, a large number of variables and scales both in time and space. The present work aims to
provide readers with an overview of recent progress and achievements in using the lattice Boltzmann method
for combustion simulations. The article reviews some basic concepts from the lattice Boltzmann method and
discusses different strategies to extend the method to compressible flows. Some of the lattice Boltzmann
models developed to model mass transport in multi-species system are also discussed. The article provides
a comprehensive overview of models and strategies developed in the past years to simulate combustion with
the lattice Boltzmann method and discuss some of the most recent applications, remaining challenges and
prospects.

1. Introduction

The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), proposed as an improve-
ment over the lattice Gas automata [1] in the early 80’s has grown
popular over the past decades [2,3]. The rapid emergence of this
numerical method is mainly due to the simplicity and locality of the
involved time-evolution operators [4,5]. The locality of the operators
and intrinsic coupling between the pressure and velocity fields through
the distribution function (as opposed to pressure-based incompress-
ible or low Mach solvers) allow for better performances on parallel
clusters and a much more efficient treatment of flows in complex
geometries [5]. During the past decade, the LBM, originally proposed
for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been extended to many
complex flow configurations ranging from non-Newtonian [6–10], to
multi-phase [11–23], and multi-component flows [24–26]. Although
initially limited to low-Mach isothermal flows with an ideal gas equa-
tion of state, the lattice Boltzmann (LB) approach was later modified
to lift many of these restrictions. Releasing the restriction on thermo-
compressibility is an essential step to develop LB solvers for many
applications such as combustion. The topic of combustion modeling
with the LBM was first touched upon in 1997 in an article by Succi
et al. [27]. Since then, and up until the late 2010’s, a limited number
of publications had appeared on the topic, all limited to simplified 1-D
and 2-D test-cases, see for instance [28–34]. The limited progress of
the LBM during that period might be attributed to a number of factors
such as the absence of a good compressible realization, persistent issues

with stability of solvers and the absence of multi-species formulations.
During the past years a considerable amount of research work has been
conducted to extend the LBM to compressible flows, which has led to
a number of stable and efficient realizations, see for instance [35–38].
In parallel, the stability domain of LB solvers both for incompressible
and compressible flows has been considerably expanded through more
advanced collision models, see for instance [39–44]. These two factors
along with the development of models for species transport and the idea
of hybrid solvers taking advantage of numerical methods for the species
and energy balance equations led to considerable progress in combus-
tion simulation with the LBM in recent years. Contrary to the first
wave of models, the more recent efforts have been extended and used
for many complex configurations involving thermo-acoustics, complex
geometries and turbulent flows. It has to be noted that in parallel with
efforts to develop LB-based models – which stricto sensu are Lagrangian
solvers for the discrete velocity Boltzmann equation as detailed in
2.2.2 – for combustion simulations, a number of attempts at developing
discrete velocity Boltzmann-based models with Eulerian discretization
in physical space have also been reported, see for instance [45–50].

In the present contribution we will review developments in the area
of LB simulations of combustion. Different challenges, solutions and
models developed in that area in the past years will be presented and
discussed. The review starts with a brief overview of basic concepts,
i.e. target macroscopic system and basic concepts from the LBM. In the

Here uα is the αth component of the fluid velocity, ρ is the mixture

Kronecker symbol (1 if α = β, 0 else). Note that since ∑Nsp−1

It is worth noting that in the context of most – if not all – density-
based mixture-average LBM models for combustion, a redundancy in
the number of conservation laws emerges as the momentum LBM solver
also recovers a mixture continuity equation. The redundancy can be
removed, for instance, by explicitly solving species equations (3) for
Nsp − 1 species, the last one – usually the inert species – being obtained
as Yn = 1 − ∑Nsp−1
Yk [51]. More details are provided later in Eq. (88).

2.2. Isothermal LBM for incompressible flows

The LBM finds its starting point in the Boltzmann–Bhatnagar–Gross–
Krook equation which is a balance equation for a probability distribu-
tion function, f (v, x, t), expressing the probability of finding particles
moving at velocity v at position x in space and t in time. The distribu-
tion function is tied to more classical macroscopic variables through its
moments defined as:

For instance, the conserved moments, i.e. density, momentum and total
energy are computed as

On the left hand side are the classical advection terms. The term
on the right hand side is the Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook (BGK) collision
term [52], which is an approximation to the full Boltzmann collision
kernel valid in the vicinity of the local equilibrium state, i.e. f eq.
For more detailed discussion on the collision kernel, different approxi-
mations and shortcomings interested readers are referred to [53–55],
among other sources. The local equilibrium state, f eq, is found via
minimization of the entropy under conservation of mass, momentum
and energy resulting in the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution function:

The construction of the LBM from the Boltzmann–Bhatnagar–Gross–
Krook equation has two main ingredients: (a) Reduction of the particles’
speed, v, continuous space to a discrete set, and (b) discretization of the
resulting system of hyperbolic equations in physical space and time. In
this section these two components will be briefly reviewed.

2.2.1. Discrete velocity system and discrete equilibrium state

The rationale behind the construction of the LBM consists in us-
ing a truncated version of the Boltzmann equation with the BGK
approximation to the collision term to recover the dynamics of the
macroscopic equations of interest, here the isothermal Navier–Stokes
(NS) and continuity equations.

From Boltzmann-BGK to the discrete velocity Boltzmann equations. Con-
sistent with the terminology of the early literature, in the context of the
present work we will refer to all methods using a form of the Boltzmann
equation with a discrete set of particles’ velocities as discrete velocity
models (DVM). In recent years interest in such models has been revived
in the form of numerical methods such as the LBM. DVMs generally
aim at approximating the distribution function with quadrature rules
or similar integral approximations and using a discrete set of velocities:

Fig. 1. Illustration of the tensorial product process to build D2Q9 lattice from D1Q3.

where P M (v, ρ, u) is a polynomial of order M and w(v) is the weight
function:

w (v) = (2π)−D∕2 exp

(

−

v2
2

)

.

(16)

For the quadrature to be applicable the distribution function must
be expanded as the product of a polynomial series and w(v) and the
integration variable, i.e. v normalized via the reference temperature,
i.e. ̄rT0. The constant reference temperature, as will be seen next, is the
results of the Lagrangian nature of the scheme. A change of variable
as v′ = (v − u)∕
̄rT as first used in Grad’s seminal work introducing
his moments method, see [56], is not possible here as it would lead
to changing discrete particle velocities that are also not necessarily
space-filling.

nomial of order Q and the weights as:

,

(17)

results in the maximum algebraic degree of precision, i.e. 2Q − 1. This
means that the quadrature guarantees exact recovery of moments up to
order 2Q−1

.

In the case of the classical LB stencil, a third-order quadrature is

used, i.e. Q = 3 in 1-D, with:

meaning that for the system of interest one needs to correctly recover
moments of orders zero through three of the equilibrium distribution
function

In the specific context of the LBM, the Gauss–Hermite quadrature
is utilized to satisfy most of the above-listed conditions on the discrete
distribution functions, i.e.

The simplest multi-dimensional extension of this quadrature can be ob-
tained by operating a tensorial product of the 1-D lattice. For instance,
in 2-D as illustrated in Fig. 1, this leads to the D2Q9 lattice with:

√

3̄rT0 ∈ {0, 1, 0, −1, 0, 1, −1, −1, 1},

A similar procedure is used to obtain the D3Q27 lattice for 3-D simu-
lations.

Discrete equilibrium: polynomial form. A number of different ways for
constructing the discrete equilibrium have been proposed over the
years. One of the early approaches, first discussed in [57] was to
re-write the equilibrium as:

One of the most interesting feature of this equilibrium, contrary to
polynomial equilibria is that, as demonstrated in [18,65], it guarantees
unconditional linear stability. For a more detailed discussion on the
entropic method we refer readers to a recently published review [66].

(25)

An alternative construction based on an expansion of the distribution
function with Hermite polynomials was proposed, which led to the
following final form [58,59]:

√

Alternatively the polynomial equilibrium can also be constructed
via the product form [60,61]. The product form of the equilibrium
distribution function is a special realization of the moments matching
approach. Considering the standard discrete velocity set D3Q27, where
D=3 stands for three dimensions and Q = 27 is the number of discrete
velocities [60,62],

ci = (cix, ciy, ciz), ciα ∈ {−1, 0, 1},

(27)

one first defines a triplet of functions in two variables, ξα and ζαα [37,
60,62],

Ψ0(ξα, ζαα) = 1 − ζαα,
ξα + ζαα
2

Ψ1(ξα, ζαα) =

,

Ψ−1(ξα, ζαα) =

−ξα + ζαα
2

(28)

(29)

(30)

and considers a product-form associated with the discrete velocities ci
(27),

Ψi = Ψcix

(ξx, ζxx)Ψciy

(ξy, ζyy)Ψciz

(ξz, ζzz).

(31)

All pertinent populations below are determined by specifying the pa-
rameters ξα and ζαα in the product-form (31). The two-dimensional
version of the model on the D2Q9 lattice is obtained by omitting
the z-component in all formulas. After matching moments with their
continuous counter-parts the parameters are set as,

2.2.2. The LBM equation
From discrete velocity Boltzmann to the lattice Boltzmann equations. To
get to the final form of the LB equations, two main ingredients are
to be used: (a) integration of the discrete velocity Boltzmann equation
along their constant characteristics and (b) a re-definition of the discrete
distribution functions. The former step results in:

(x + ciδt, t + δt)

fi

− fi (x, t) = ∫

t

t+δt

(x(t′), t′) dt′.

Ωi

(37)

Note that up to this point, Eq. (37) is an exact integration of Eq. (12)
as characteristics, i.e. ci, are constant. The term on the right-hand
side however, representing collision, has to be approximated. Simply
approximating the integral via Ωi (x, t) δt would obviously lead to a
first-order approximation. Instead, to get a second-order approximation
one can use the trapezoidal rule:

t+δt

∫
t

(x(t′), t′) dt′ =

Ωi

δt
2

Ωi (x, t) +

δt
2

(x + ciδt, t + δt)

Ωi

+  (δt3) .

(38)

However, as observed here, application of the trapezoidal rule would
make the scheme implicit and therefore not attractive regarding effi-
ciency. The second ingredient, i.e. redefinition of the discrete distribu-
tion function as [67]:
δt
2

̄fi = fi −

(39)

Ωi,

changes the discrete system of equations solving Eq. (12) into a fully
explicit scheme:
(x + ciδt, t + δt)

α (x, t) − ̄fi (x, t)

− ̄fi (x, t) =

(f eq

(40)

) ,

̄fi

̄τ

where ̄τ is now defined as:

̄τ = τ + δt∕2.

(41)

ξα = uα,
ζαα = c2

s + u2
α,

(32)

(33)

Eq. (43) forms the basis of the now-famous automata of the LBM,
referred to as the collision-streaming algorithm, where distribution func-
tions first relax through collision,

and the local equilibrium populations are represented with the product-
form (31),

̄f ∗
i (x, t) = ̄fi (x, t) +

δt
̄τ

(f eq

α (x, t) − ̄fi (x, t)

f eq

(34)

and then stream
(x + ciδt, t + δt)

̄fi

= ̄f ∗

i (x, t) .

(42)

(43)

This form of the discrete equilibrium populations is equivalent to third-
order quadrature-based scheme with a full expansion of the distribution
function.

Alternative to polynomial equilibria: Entropic equilibria. As an alternative
to the classical discrete equilibrium construction approach where all
degrees of freedom are used to fulfill moments constraints, the en-
tropic approach adds minimization of an entropy functional to the list
of constraints, changing the equilibrium construction problem into a
constrained minimization problem. The discrete entropy functional is
defined as [63,64]:
( fi
wi

Hwi,ci

Q−1
∑

fi ln

(35)

)

=

.

i=0

Minimization of this functional under constraints on moments of order
zero and one, leads to the following well-known entropic equilib-
rium [64]:

The above-presented discrete system, i.e. (43), is overall a second-
order approximation to Eq. (12) where errors come exclusively from
the trapezoidal approximation to the collision integral. Note that this
system could be equivalently written as a Strang splitting coupling of
the streaming and collision operators where the change of variable
and trapezoidal rule used to approximate the collision contribution are
exactly equivalent to a second-order Crank–Nicolson approximation,
leading to an overall accuracy of order two. Further details and proof
can be found in [68].

system of equations shows that it recovers the isothermal continuity
plus NS system of equations for an ideal equation of state at reference

where the coefficient 1∕3 is specific to the third-order quadrature. Note
that the recovered system of macroscopic equations further admits a
defect in the viscous stress tensor; For the classical second-order poly-
nomial expansion defects are present both in shear and bulk viscosity

scaling in both cases as ∝  2
α is the character-
istic velocity along the α-axis. For the full polynomial expansion or
product-form equilibria, this defect is only present in the bulk viscosity.
This means that under acoustic scaling, i.e. δx∕δt = const the
solver converges to the compressible isothermal NS equations, as for
a fixed characteristic velocity  the Mach number remains constant
in the limit δt → 0. Furthermore, under acoustic scaling the defects
in the effective viscosities do not vanish. Under diffusive scaling on
the other hand, i.e. δx2∕δt = constant, the solver converges to the
incompressible NS equations, as  ∕cs → 0 in the limit of δt → 0 and
the defect in the effective viscosities also goes to zero. This approach
to the incompressible limit has two well-known implications: (a) A
fully hyperbolic system of equations which is advantageous for par-
allel processing and (b) a finite propagation speed for normal modes,
i.e. acoustics, which has to be kept one order of magnitude higher
than the convective modes characteristic speed-equivalent to keeping
the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) number low, which leads to smaller
time steps.

3. LBM for compressible reacting flows

We have now introduced the main ingredients of classical LBM, and
shown that it allows to recover the continuity (4) and momentum (1)
equations of a weakly compressible gas at constant temperature T0. This
is indeed not sufficient for combustion applications, where energy (2)
and species (3) are absolutely required.

This Section is divided into three main subsections. First, we shall
explore different alternatives for the resolution of the additional equa-
tions (energy and species) in Section 3.1. Second, we will detail the
required changes to the LB formulation in Section 3.2. Finally, we
will list the reactive flow configurations successfully simulated by LBM
solvers and discuss their performance in Section 3.4.

3.1. Energy and species balance equations

3.1.1. Energy balance for thermal flows: Double distribution function

While, as further discussed in Section 3.2.1, the isothermal LBM can
be extended to recover the energy balance equation by increasing the
number of moments constraints in the discretization, the Boltzmann–
BGK model of Eq. (9) comes with a number of shortcomings, i.e. fixed
heat capacity ratio due to mono-atomic consideration and fixed Prandtl
number.

General framework. Alternatives such as Holway’s ellipsoidal statis-
tics [69] or Shakhov’s model [70] allow for variable Prandtl numbers.
However note that each one of these realizations only admits an H-
theorem in a limited range of Prantl numbers, i.e. for Shakhov’s model
Pr ≤ 1 and for Holway’s model 2∕3 ≤ Pr ≤ ∞. For a detailed discussion
and corresponding proofs we refer interested readers to [18,71].

Furthermore, these models do not address the issue of specific
heat capacities ratio. A solution to that issue was proposed in Rykov’s
pioneering work in [72] where he introduced a second distribution
function carrying roto-vibrational contributions to internal energy. A
variety of LBM models for thermal flows referred to as double distribu-
tion function (DDF) find their root in Rykov’s work [72]. In the context
of LBM, the DDF can be represented through the following general form
of the evolution equation:

̄fi(x + ciδt, t + δt) − ̄fi(x, t) =

δt

(f eq

i (x, t) − ̄fi(x, t)

where Eq. (46) governs the evolution of the second distribution func-
tion, ̄gi, with:

Quasi-equilibrium formulation. Here, noting that all extensions to the
Boltzmann–BGK equation discussed above can be re-written as special
realizations of a more general class of models called quasi-equilibrium
models, see [18,73–75] for more details, the discrete system has been
recast into that form. More specifically, here we have a two relaxation
time quasi-equilibrium model where the relaxation towards the local
equilibrium state {f eq
i } is decomposed into a ‘‘fast’’ relaxation from
i
the current state {fi, gi} to an intermediate quasi-equilibrium {f ∗
i , g∗
i }
followed by a ‘‘slow’’ relaxation from there towards the local equilib-
rium. The relaxation rate in each one of these processes is controlled by
an independent coefficient, i.e. δt∕ ̄τ for the slow process and δt∕ ̄τ+δt∕ ̄τ1
for the fast process. Note that the fast–slow decomposition implies:

where the first term is the Fourier diffusive flux while the second
term is viscous heating. Note that the Fourier term is only correctly
recovered for H = H(T ). For dependence on additional variables such
as species mass fractions corrections are discussed at the end of this
section. The double distribution function approach in combination with
a proper LBM solver for density and momentum balance, detailed in
next sections, has been used to model trans- and supersonic flows, for
instance in [37]. A few results are illustrated in Fig. 2.

Other variants and realizations. A wide variety of realizations are pos-
sible and have been proposed over the past decade to recover different
forms of the energy balance equation. For instance, one possible change
̄gi which can be changed from total
is the zeroth-order moment of
energy as used in Eq. (47), to internal energy or non-translational
internal energy, see for instance [78,79]. However, note that each
one of these approaches come with their own additional issues. For
example, the first documented use of the DDF in the context of the
LBM transported only internal energy with ̄gi which led to non-local
coupling terms – both in space and time – in the LB equation [67].

Multi-species flows. For the extension of this model to the case of multi-
species flows in the context of a mixture-averaged formulation a few
points must be noted:

• In all models discussed here, at the ε2 order a Fourier flux of this

form is recovered, see Eq. (59):

where Hk is the enthalpy of the kth species.

• In multi-species flows, diffusive mass flux leads to a net transport

of enthalpy which is absent in single-component flows.

A solution to both these shortcomings was proposed in [80] to recover
consistent hydrodynamics, where the multi-species quasi-equilibrium
g∗
i is amended with two additional terms, one neutralizing the error in
the Fourier diffusion and one introducing enthalpy flux through mass

The next section will discuss models to recover the species balance
equations.

3.1.2. Kinetic models for species balance equations

Over the past decades and starting in the early 2000’s [81,82] vari-
ous attempt at developing LB-based models for mixtures have been doc-
umented, see for instance [83–87]. Some of these models are reviewed
in this section.

Thermal mixture-averaged model of kang et al.
In [88], the authors
proposed a multi-component thermal model for catalytic systems. The
model is an extension on previous work documented in [89–92]. It
consists of Nsp sets of LB solvers, i.e. one per species:

̄gki(x + ckiδt, t + δt) − ̄gki(x, t) =

δt
̄τk1

(g∗

)
ki(ρk, uk) − ̄gki(x, t)

+

(geq

δt
̄τk2
The first point to note in this model is that post-streaming discrete
distribution functions migrate to x + ckiδt meaning each species’ lattice
have different discrete velocity sizes. As discussed in previous sections,
in LB time-step, grid-size and reference sound speed are tied through:

)
ki (ρk, u) − ̄gki(x, t)

+ ψki.

(63)

T0
W

δx2

which in the context of this model where W = Wk is different for each
species, and assuming that the time-step size is the same for all solvers,
would mean:

(64)

‖ckiα‖ =

δt

√

T0
Wk

(65)

i.e. species will not propagate on the same grid. To overcome this issue,
and following [93] the authors proposed to set the grid-size to that
needed for the lightest species in the system, and for other species to
use interpolation in order to reconstruct distribution functions on the
grid. The equilibrium, geq
ki (ρk, u) follows the product-form equilibrium
of Eq. (34) with a few differences, namely:

ξkα = uα

The term ψki in Eq. (63) is a correction term accounting for: (a) a
correction velocity ensuring that the global diffusive mass flux is null,
and (b) corrections for equilibrium moments of order three and four
not recovered by the first-neighbor lattice. The latter terms allow the
scheme to recover the proper viscous stress tensor and non-equilibrium
heat flux. In this model the macroscopic properties are computed as:

A multi-scale expansion of the model shows that it recovers the mixture-
averaged multi-species equations and the Hirschfelder–Curtiss approx-
imation with the mass corrector.

Force-based approach of Vienne et al.
In [94], following the kinetics
model of [95], Vienne et al. proposed a LBM for isothermal multi-
species mixtures recovering the Maxwell–Stefan diffusion mechanism.
Considering a mixture made up of Nsp individual species, they proposed
a coupled system of Nsp LB solvers:

̄gki(x + ciδt, t + δt) − ̄gki(x, t) =

where 

authors used Guo’s approach [96] to introduce the body force into

ki. As noted by the authors, the circular inter-dependence between
the force of Eq. (77) and the momenta of individual species make the
scheme implicit. A multi-scale analysis shows that this model recovers
the following multi-component isothermal mass

fingering instability for a system with two species.

The model has been successfully used to study miscible multi-compo-
nent flow behaviors such as viscous fingering, see Fig. 3.

An extension of this model to thermal and reacting cases is yet to

be done.

Model of Sawant et al.
In Refs. [80,98], the authors proposed a LBM
for compressible reacting multi-species flows recovering the Stefan–
Maxwell diffusion closure together with barodiffusion. The model uses
Nsp + 1 LB equations: a solver for the mixture-averaged mass and
momentum balance, a solver for the mixture-averaged energy balance
and Nsp − 1 solvers for the species. The species balance equations are
defined as in Eq. (76) with the non-homogeneous term, 

Different from [88], this model does not need additional interpolation
steps as all distribution functions propagate on-lattice. Furthermore,
to eliminate the over-determination of the system when coupled to
mixture mass, momentum and energy balance the distribution functions

This model, in combination with compressible LBM for momentum and
energy balance equations, has been successfully used for a variety of
cases involving combustion applications with detailed chemistry, as
illustrated in Fig. 4. Models discussed here and in the previous section
were all based on consistent kinetic models. Another, more simplistic,
approach to solve the additional energy and species balance equations
is to use a simple LB solver for an ad-hoc advection–diffusion–reaction
equation and add correction terms as needed. While the approach is
less advantageous than kinetic models and even hybrid approaches, it
is discussed next for the sake of completeness.

3.1.3. Advection–diffusion–reaction LBM

which would lead to the following shortcomings:

Advection–diffusion–reaction LB solvers are models where only con-
servation of the zeroth-order moment of the distribution function is en-
sured by the collision operator. In such models, to solve an advection–
diffusion–reaction partial differential equation for a field Ψ , a distribu-
tion function ̄gi is defined such that:

• An error of the form T ∂uα∕∂xα in the convection term.
• An error of the form:

in the Fourier diffusion term.

(89)

• The enthalpy flux due to species mass diffusion is missing.

where S is the source term. A classical non-homogeneous collision-
streaming equation of the form:

(93)

On that note, let us now discuss this approach in the specific context of
the species mass and energy balance equations. Although a number of
different works have presented modified models for non-linear depen-
dence of the diffusion driving force on the zeroth-order moment even in
the context of multi-species flows, see for instance [100,101], here we
will limit our discussion to models that have been used for combustion
simulation.

Energy balance equation. The energy balance equation can be written
in a variety of different ways, see [51]. Here we will only discuss the
form involving temperature:

(94)

The simplest approach to recover this balance equation is to set Ψ = T .
In doing so at the first two orders in the smallness parameter, ε, of the
perturbation analysis one recovers the following balance equation [5]:

∂T

(95)

While one can overcome these issues via alternative forms of the
equilibrium distribution function, see for instance [102], the simplest
way to circumvent these issues is to define the source term S in Eq. (93)
as:

S = −

̇ωT

(96)

Such an approach, among others, has been used in [103,104] specifi-
cally targeting combustion. Note that in [103,104] the last term was not
considered. A similar approach can be undertaken for the case where
the enthalpy or energy balance equation is targeted [103,104].

Species mass balance equations. For the sake of simplicity let us assume
that the species mass fraction balance equation is targeted. Taking the
zeroth-order moment of the distribution function to be mass fraction, Yk
and neglecting for the time being leading-order errors in the multi-scale
analysis one would recover a diffusion term of the form:

−

∂
∂xα

[( 1
2

−

̄τ
δt

) ∂Yk
∂xα

]

,

which using ̄τ∕δt = Dk∕c2
s + 1∕2 in Eq. (90) recovers the generalized
Fick approximation. That approach is confronted with a number of
issues [100]:

• This form of diffusion is only valid in the limit of vanishing

density changes as the recover diffusion term is

−

∂
∂xα

[

Dk

]

,

∂Yk
∂xα

instead of
[

−

1
ρ

∂
∂xα

Dk

]

.

∂Yk
∂xα

• The form of the convection term as recovered in Eq. (93) ad-
mits an error of the form Yk∂uα∕∂xα, which only vanishes for
incompressible flows.

• It is well known that the generalized Fick approximation does
not conserve overall mass, unless either Nsp = 2 or Dk = D,

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience102(2024)1011408

S.A. Hosseini et al.

∀k [105,106]. To deal with that issue there are two approaches;
If mass fraction of one particular species is dominant everywhere,
e.g. that of N2 in combustion with air, the balance equation for
that species is not explicitly solved and one sets YN2
= 1 −
∑Nsp−1

. A more general approach, valid also for non-dilute

k=0,k≠N2

mixture is to introduce a mass corrector [105,106].

• In cases where the driving force of the diffusive flux is a lin-
ear function of the variable for which the balance equation is
solved, for instance the Fick approximation, the passive scalar
model can be used as is. However, for models where the driving
force of diffusive flux is a non-linear function that depends on
variables other than the zeroth-order moment, for instance the
Hirschfelder–Curtiss approximation [107], one would have errors
of the same order as the diffusive flux itself.

A number of different approaches have been proposed in the literature
to account for these shortcomings, see for instance [100,101]. One
of the most straightforward approaches, as used in [103,104], is to
put all corrections into a source term. For instance, assuming one
targets the mass fraction balance equation with the generalized Fick
approximation, the source term S would be:

S = Yk

∂uα
∂xα

+

Dk
ρ

∂Yk
∂xα

∂ρ
∂xα

.

(97)

Note that this approach as used in [103,104] recovers the Fick ap-
proximation to diffusion which is different from the widely used
Hirschfelder–Curtiss approximation [107] and which does not guaran-
tee overall mass conservation when all species do not have the same
diffusion coefficient [106].

As discussed earlier, an alternative to using tailored advection–
diffusion–reaction LBM for the energy and species mass balance equa-
tions, is to directly discretize the macroscopic balance equations. This
approach is discussed next.

3.1.4. Hybrid models: Finite difference and finite volume solvers for energy
and species

Hybrid models are closest to multiple distribution functions ap-
proaches. In multiple distribution functions, let us remind that ρE (or
an alternative energy form) and ρYk correspond to the zeroth order of
separate distribution functions.

When the number of species to be considered becomes large —
typically (10 − 100), the memory required to solve all scalars increases
very quickly, which may become prohibitive for detailed chemistry
descriptions. Hybrid models reduce the memory load by introducing a
single scalar for (ρE, ρYk) instead of the number of discrete velocities.
Each additional conserved scalar ρφ (where φ may represent E or Yk) is
solved by classical finite-difference or finite-volume (FD/FV) schemes,
while continuity (4) and momentum (1) equations are still solved via
their associated distribution function ̄fi.

Let us now list the main advantages of the hybrid method:

1. The memory footprint is reduced, as only one additional scalar
needs to be stored for each energy or species equation, vs. 27 for
a D3Q27 distribution.

2. They are by construction free of Prandtl, Schmidt or γ numbers
limitations, since energy/species resolution is tackled separately.
3. Since they use the same formalism as classical reactive flow
solvers for energy and species equations, it is straightforward to
take into account combustion-specific terms (turbulent combus-
tion closures, advanced transport models, Soret effect or multi-
component diffusion etc.), based on the experience accumulated
over many decades using FD/FV solvers.

In turn, hybrid methods suffer from the following drawbacks:

1. Ensuring consistency between the LBM scheme (for continuity
and momentum equations) and FD/FV schemes is not straight-
forward (at the opposite of, e.g. multi-speed or multiple distribu-
tion approaches). This can typically lead to disastrous spurious
currents.

2. FD/FV schemes based only on nearest-neighbor stencils (as used
in most LBM solvers) are typically much more dissipative than
LBM schemes [108].

The first point is crucial in designing hybrid LBM schemes, and is
therefore discussed at length hereafter. The impact of the second point
is limited for most applications as long as the vortical and acoustic
modes are left within the LBM part of the solver.

Which form to use for species/energy equations in a hybrid LBM scheme?
Energy and species equations may be written in a variety of forms
(based on total energy, internal energy, temperature, . . . ). While these
forms are indeed equivalent for a continuous formulation, their cou-
pling under discrete form with the LBM scheme may be very different.
Let us recall that for small perturbations and neglecting all dis-
sipation terms (reducing to the multi-component Euler equations),
the system (4)–(3) may be linearized, and each perturbation can be
decomposed into the so-called Kovasznay modes [109,110] (acoustic
mode, 3 components of the vorticity modes, entropy mode, and 1 per
species).

For instance, the entropy mode of the Euler system follows the

equation

∂s
∂t

+ uα

∂s
∂xα

= 0,

and is only weakly coupled with the rest of the system.

For this reason, hybrid methods using an entropy equation were
shown to provide reasonable results for moderately compressible flows
[111–113] using several classical convective numerical schemes a pri-
ori unrelated with LBM:

• Second-order central difference schemes, potentially blended with

upwind, [114–117]

• Lax–Wendroff scheme [118,119]
• MUSCL schemes [111–113]
• Heun scheme [120],
• . . .

Indeed, for reactive flows, the entropy equation is complex to
derive in its general case. However, the enthalpy equation under non-
conservative form

is also a characteristic mode of the system — provided the pres-

Species also directly follow characteristic equations, provided they

It is clear that this equation is the sum of the non-conservative form
(a system characteristic) and the continuity equation. Therefore, any
numerical error between the continuity equation solved by LBM and
the one hidden into the conservative form leads to an inconsistency.

To summarize, provided the equations to be solved using FD/FV are
only weakly coupled with the rest of the system, the resulting hybrid

corresponding total energy equation scheme [119]. Shown are the density fields for configuration 3 at time t = 0.3.

LBM solver has been shown to provide reasonable results for a wide
number of cases. This minor shortcoming has since been corrected by
the development of adequate numerical schemes to directly solve total
energy and species equations under conservative form, as explained
hereafter.

Restoring the conservativity of hybrid LBM. Eqs. (98), (99) are equivalent
to the initial total energy and species Eqs. (2), (3), but the discrete
formulation is not. This has two disadvantages:

• Global energy conservation is not numerically enforced (while the
LBM scheme is numerically mass and momentum preserving).
• Rankine–Hugoniot relationships are not satisfied across disconti-

nuities.

The latter is clearly visible in Fig. 5, which presents a reference 2-D
Riemann problem and the solution as obtained with hybrid LBM using
Muscl-Hancock scheme to solve the entropy equation.

Wissocq et al. [119,120] recently presented a method to construct
a linearly equivalent total energy scheme from any FD/FV scheme that
is linearly stable for hybrid LBM (e.g., for the entropy equation). This
results in a numerically conservative scheme for mass, momentum,
total energy and species.

3.2. Compressible continuity and momentum balance equations

All strategies presented above for the resolution of the additional
energy and species equations coupled to a LBM solver require modifi-
cations to the LBM core. The major options are presented hereafter.

3.2.1. Lattices with higher-order quadratures
Standard approach with polynomial equilibria. As discussed in Section 2.2
the Maxwell–Boltzmann phase-space continuous equilibrium can be
matched at the discrete level via a number of methods following the
same general principle, matching the different moments of the con-
tinuous equilibrium with the discretized version. As such the classical
moment-matching method routinely used for Eulerian discrete velocity
Boltzmann models and truncated Hermite expansion approach both
fall into that category. In the case of the former, once the number of
constraints on moments of the equilibrium and degrees of freedom in
the form of number of discrete velocities have been set, construction of
the discrete equilibria boils down to solving the following linear system:

M f eq = Π MB,

(101)

where Π MB is a vector of size 1 × Q, Q being the number of constraints
on moments, with moments of the Maxwell–Boltzmann continuous
distribution corresponding to the targeted constraints with:

Π MB

n = ∫ vp

xvq

(102)

equilibria to moments. For instance, in 1-D, for a solver targeting the
Navier–Stokes–Fourier dynamics a minimum of five discrete velocities
are needed as one must correctly recover moments of order zero to
four. This approach to construct a discrete solver, while being quite
flexible has a number of shortcomings, namely: The matrix M is not
necessarily invertible for any choice of moments and discrete velocities
as illustrated by the introduction of so-called anti-symmetric discrete
velocities in some higher-order discrete velocity Boltzmann models,
see for instance [122]; while the number of velocities is set by the
constraints the sizes and size-ratios of these velocities have no a priori
closures and are usually tuned via trial and error. A possible closure for
the size of the discrete velocities would be to use Hermite polynomials
roots of the corresponding order. The only issue with that choice is that
above order three Hermite roots do not guarantee space-filling lattices
and therefore on-lattice propagation.

Nevertheless, a large number of publications using larger discrete

velocity sets are documented in the literature:

• A group of these publications do not rely on Lagrangian ap-
proaches to discretize physical space and time and use Eulerian
approaches such as FD or FV to discretize the coupled system
of hyperbolic equations of the discrete velocity Boltzmann equa-
tions. In doing so the sizes of discrete velocities can be freely
tuned to stabilize the simulation for a specific test-case, see [123]
for a review.

• Another group of publications use Lagrangian approach to dis-
cretize physical space and time and overcome the issue of non-
space-filling lattices by supplementing the collision-propagation
step with an interpolation step to bring back post-streaming
discrete velocities on lattice. These approaches are sometimes
referred to as semi-Lagrangian, see for instance [124,125].

• Another category of publications, relying on the classical on-
lattice method, proposes to stabilize multi-speed LB solvers for
compressible flows through different collision models, such as
multiple-relaxation time or regularized, see for instance [126,
127].

All of the previously-listed models have had limited success in mod-
eling generic high-speed compressible flows with large temperature
variations in the domain. A number of alternatives have been proposed
since then to considerably widen the stability domain of multi-speed
LB solvers. They will be discussed next.

Extension of stability domain: Entropic equilibria. The entropic construc-
tion of the discrete equilibrium state introduced for isothermal models,
can be reformulated in a more general form as a minimization problem
subject to M constraints:

with n = p+q +r. The quantity f eq is the vector of sizes 1×Q containing
discrete equilibria and M the transformation matrix from discrete

(103)

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience102(2024)10114010

S.A. Hosseini et al.

The formal solution of this constrained minimization leads to a function
of the following form:

f eq
i = ρwi exp

{[ M
∑

(Q−1

.

(104)

Note that other form of the minimizer without the weights wi have
also been proposed and used in the literature [128], most notably
for entropic Grad moments methods [128,129]. For instance, a model
imposing only constraints on collisional invariants would lead to the
following discrete equilibrium [130]:

f eq
i = ρwi exp

{[λ0 + λαciα + λ2c2

i

]} .

(105)

It is interesting to note that while, for the most part, entropic equilibria
construction has been done by enforcing constraints on collisional
invariants, one may reduce higher-order moments error by adding
corresponding constraint in Eq. (103). This is sometimes referred to
as guiding the equilibrium and corresponding discrete equilibria are
referred to as guided equilibria [60,131]. In the context of the LBM,
this extension of constraints was discussed for the first time in [132]
through the concept of auxiliary and target equilibria. There, auxiliary
equilibria were constructed by enforcing constraints on collisional in-
variants and target equilibria, a combination of auxiliary equilibria and
additional degrees of freedom, by enforcing constraints on higher order
moments.

Once the form of the equilibrium distribution function has been
determined, its construction consists of finding the expression of the
different Lagrangian multiplicators. This is done by introducing back
the discrete equilibrium into the set of constraints which would lead to
a system of M equations with M unknowns, i.e. the Lagrange multipli-
ers, to be determined. While an analytical expression was derived for
the isothermal case with D + 1 constraints, for larger systems no such
closed-form solutions exist. In the absence of a closed form solution
one can use numerical methods such as Newton iterations to find the
Lagrange multipliers at every grid-point and every time-step [133].

As shown in previous sections, one systematic approach to choose
an optimal set of discrete velocities is to rely on the Gauss–Hermite
quadrature and roots of Hermite polynomials. However, apart from
the third-order quadrature leading to the DdQ3d lattices, all other
higher order quadratures result in off-lattice propagation of some of
the discrete distribution functions. In [61], starting from a set of
discrete velocities the authors proposed an approach to find a reference
temperature and corresponding weights. This is achieved through the
closure relation and matching conditions. For a set of discrete velocities
 with Q vectors ci, the Qth power of ci can be written as a linear
combination of lower order odd-powers from Q − 2 to 1, i.e.

i

+ ⋯ + a1ci.

+ aQ−4cQ−4

i = aQ−2cQ−2
cQ
For instance, in the case of the D1Q3 lattice one has c3
i = ci. This essen-
tially means that the moment of order Q is not an independent moment
and cannot be set at one’s will. The only possibility is to set the linear
in u term of the Qth order to its Maxwell–Boltzmann counter-part and
in doing so determine the reference temperature, which is referred to
as the matching condition. Consider for instance the D1Q3 lattice again.
The third-order moment is going to be ux while the Maxwell–Boltzmann
distribution leads to u3
x + 3T0ux. To match the linear term one must
have 3T0 = 1. Note that not any choice of lattice admits a reference
temperature. For example the velocity set  = {−2, −1, 0, +1, +2} will
lead to a closure relation of the form c5
i − 4ci and a matching
condition, 15T 2
0 − 15T0 + 4 = 0, which does not admit any real-valued
solutions. This explains why the shortest admissible five-velocity lattice
is  = {−3, −1, 0, +1, +3} with T0 = 1 ±
2∕5. Once the reference
temperature is determined, the weights are readily found by matching
the moments of the discrete equilibrium at ρ = 1 and ux = 0 to
their Maxwell–Boltzmann counter-parts. Considering the condition of
positivity of the weights one also find the range of temperature that

relations and reference temperatures of a number of 1-D lattice are
summarized in Table 1.

One successful example of such lattices is the D2Q49 shown in

Fig. 6.

which lead to Tmin = 1 −
2∕5. Note that the
range of accessible temperatures can be further extended by changing
the ratio of the largest and shortest discrete velocities, here ±3 and
±1. In [133] the author also proposed pruning strategies to reduce the
number of discrete velocities in 2-D and 3-D, leading to the D3Q39
lattice, which reduces the discrete velocities by one order of magnitude
compared to the tensor product of the D1Q7, i.e. D3Q343.

Adaptive reference frame models. As observed for both isothermal and
compressible models, errors in higher-order moments scale with the
deviations of local temperature and velocity from the lattice reference
temperature and velocity. For all symmetric lattices considered up to
that point the lattice reference velocity is U = 0. In [134] the authors
proposed to challenge the idea of a reference frame at rest by introduc-
ing a non-zero shift U . It was noted that the discrete entropy functional
is uniquely defined by the weights wi. The weights of a lattice with Q
discrete velocities, as shown in the previous section, are determined by
matching the first Q moments of the Maxwell–Boltzmann equilibrium
distribution function at temperature T and ux = 0:

Q−1
∑

i=0

φ(ci)wi(0, rT ) = ∫ φ(v)f MB(0, rT )dv.

(109)

It was shown through the Galilean-invariance of the moments of the
Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution function and the binomial theorem
that the weights are also Galilean-invariant and therefore untouched
by the change of reference frame. The immediate consequences of that
observation are: (a) construction of 3-D lattices via tensorial product
of the 1-D lattice remains as before, (b) assuming U = kδx∕δt with
k ∈ Z the propagation remains on-lattice and (c) the discrete entropy
functional is Galilean invariant and therefore equilibrium populations

are form invariant under the shift of reference frame. This point along
with the effect of the shift on operation range has also been discussed
for standard isothermal lattices [135]. The process of changing the
reference frame and resulting discrete lattice is illustrated in Fig. 7
through the D2Q49 lattice. The use of the shifted lattice along with
the entropic equilibrium has been successfully used to model a wide
variety of high Mach number flows as illustrated in Fig. 8. The idea of
shifted reference frames was later generalized to local adaptive refer-
ence velocity and temperature through the particles on demand (PonD)
method [38]. In this approach the collision streaming operation is
performed on a reference frame corresponding to the local velocity and
temperature. This allows to minimize higher-order moments deviations
of the discrete equilibrium from the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution
function and in doing so allows for arbitrarily large variations in speed
and temperature. The particles on demand method has been used
to model high Mach number cases in recent years [136]. It is also
currently used in combination with a Lee–Tarver reaction model to
simulate detonation at high Mach numbers, see [137] (see Fig. 9).

3.2.2. Standard lattice density-based solvers
Coupling to temperature field. As discussed in Section 2.2, the original
LBM was targeting the incompressible limit as the asymptotic behavior
of the isothermal NS equations. To that end the temperature appearing
in the equilibrium distribution function was that of a reference state
guaranteeing validity of the low Mach assumption. The compressible
NS equations can be recovered by replacing the reference temperature
with the local fluid temperature obtained from the second distribution
function or the FD/FV solver used for energy balance; Considering for
instance Eq. (33) it changes into:

ζαα = c2

3.2.3. Pressure-based solvers

While the density-based model detailed in the previous section was
successfully used for a number of applications, see [115,140], it was
observed that it led to spurious currents near curved flame interfaces,
see Fig. 11 for a circular flame. A detailed study of numerical properties
of the model showed that this is a result of a non-physical coupling
between entropic and vorticity mode, see [141]. A pressure-based
formulation was then proposed [111] to cure the problem, the detailed
reason only being understood later [112]. The pressure-based algorithm
is presented hereafter.

parameter, it will inevitably deviate from the reference temperature,
i.e. θ = 1 which is the optimal operation temperature of the third-
order quadrature-based LBM. Deviation from the reference temperature
comes with a number of difficulties. The first one is the reduced domain
of stability, illustrated best by the linear stability domain shown in
Fig. 10. The second is that to properly recover the full NS viscous
stress tensor a number of additional considerations have to be taken
into account. These are discussed in the next paragraph.

Galilean-invariance of third-order moments and corrections. A simple
multi-scale analysis shows that at the NS level, moments of orders two
and three of the EDF must be correctly recovered. Diagonal components
of the third-order moments tensor, i.e. moments of the form Πααα,
cannot be correctly recovered due to the c3
iα = ciα bias of the third-order
quadrature-based lattice. While the continuous Maxwell–Boltzmann
equilibrium distribution leads to:

any of the discrete equilibrium distribution functions discussed here
recovers:

Π eq

ααα = 3ρc2
s ,

(113)

which for θ = 1 introduces a cubic-in-velocity error and for θ ≠ 1 a
linear one. As such the issue of Galilean-variance of the third-order
moments becomes quite critical in the case of compressible flows where
θ ≠ const. To account for this error, corrections in the form of source
terms are usually introduced. Consider the following non-homogeneous
LBM equations:

where Si is a yet-to-be determined non-homogeneous term accounting
for third-order moments errors. The form of the source term, 

This second point was presented by the authors as a predictor–corrector
procedure, close to early artificial compressibility methods [146,147].
It is important to note, however, that despite being pressure-based, the
algorithm is mass conserving globally, as density-based methods.

Link between pressure-based and density based formulations. Since many
mesh transition algorithms, boundary conditions, etc. were initially
developed for density-based algorithms [148], there is an interest in
establishing a rigorous link between pressure-based and density-based
algorithm.

This can be obtained noting that the correction ρ(t, x)[1 − θ(t, x)] in
the macroscopic reconstruction can be equivalently embedded directly
in the f0 term corresponding to the stationary discrete velocity by
introducing the density-based function:

3.2.4. Low mach thermo-compressible pressure-based solver

In 2019, Hosseini et al. proposed a low Mach LB scheme for simu-
lations of combustion, and more generally of dilatable flows [152]. A
low Mach reduction of the fully compressible models of the previous
section was also proposed in [153]. The scheme is categorized as low
Mach in the sense that it follows the philosophy of Majda’s zero-Mach
model [154] where after a Helmholtz decomposition of the velocity
field, the divergence-free part is obtained via Poisson’s equation and
the curl-free part from the species and energy fluxes. At the difference
of Majda’s zero-Mach model, here the divergence-free component solver
allows for a certain level of compressibility, i.e. spurious acoustic
waves. To recover this modified set of macroscopic equations the model
makes use of the following modified kinetic system [152]:

While only the most basic single relaxation time form of this model
is introduced here, interested readers can readily get access to more
advanced realizations, for instance via the Cumulants-based multiple
relaxation time collision operator in [42,155].

Over the past couple of years this low Mach LB solver, in combi-
nation with shock-capturing FD schemes like the weighted essentially
non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme have been used to model a variety of
complex reacting flow configurations, including

• Direct numerical simulation of turbulent combustion [156];
• Large eddy simulation of combustion in swirl burner using the
Smagorinsky subgrid-scale model and the thickened flame ap-
proximation [157,158], see [155] for details;

Some of these applications are illustrated in Fig. 13. A simpler form
of this model was also used in [160] to model droplet combustion. In
terms of limitations, the model is – as obvious by its name – limited to
the low Mach regime. Furthermore, as mentioned previously, the NS
level viscous stress tensor admits deviation, for which corrections are
to be published in an upcoming article. Finally, exact conservation is
a topic that needs improvement here as the form of the energy and
species balance equations along with the FD discretizations and curved
boundary treatment all lead to loss of exact conservation.

3.3. Closure models for turbulent flames

We have now covered the different alternatives to solve a set of
conservative Eqs. (4)–(2). Therefore, the models are applicable for
direct numerical simulations DNS, where every flow scale is resolved
(see, e.g. [116,156] for 3-D reactive DNS LBM benchmarks).

As for classical CFD methods, high Reynolds reactive flow simula-
tions require turbulent closure models [161], which may be categorized
in to Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS), or large eddy simula-
tions (LES). The authors are unaware of LBM steady RANS simulations
for combustion, so the remainder of the discussion focuses on unsteady
RANS (uRANS) and LES.

When a uRANS or LES approach is adopted [51], the main terms
requiring closure are unresolved Reynolds stresses, unresolved enthalpy
turbulent fluxes, unresolved species turbulent fluxes, and species chem-
ical reaction rate.

Regarding unresolved Reynolds stresses, most classical closure mod-
els can be straightforwardly adapted in the LBM framework [162,163]
simply by substituting the viscosity ν appearing in the collision charac-
teristic time τ (111) by ν + νt (or harmonic average as in [162]), where
νt is the effective turbulent subgrid viscosity. Most classical LES closure
models were successfully adapted: Smagorinsky in [164], Vremann
in [113], shear-improved Smagorinsky in [165]. Similarly, application
of classical uRANS closures to LBM are also found, e.g. Spalart-Almaras
in [166], k − ε and k − ω among others. Indeed, hybrid RANS-LES
approaches are also accessible [167,168].

The literature on LBM of turbulent reactive flows is relatively scarce,
stability in high Reynolds flow having only been achieved recently. The
closure of the enthalpy and species (enthalpy, species) may be straight-
forwardly implemented using a classical gradient assumption [51],

specifying turbulent Prandtl and Schmidt numbers to modify the effec-
tive diffusion coefficients in the respective equations (appearing again
in a relaxation time for double distribution method, or as a classical
diffusion operator for hybrid method).

Finally, the closure of the chemical source term is local and there-
fore presents no difference as compared with the existing literature.
Most of the turbulent reactive flow simulations encountered are ei-
ther implicit LES [150] (e.g. no closure model), or thickened flame
model [157,158] in [117,149,155].

3.4. Performance of multi-physics LBM solvers

Let us now provide details regarding the advantages and limita-
tions of multi-physics LBM solvers, and how they compare to classical
LBM solvers targeting mainly low-Mach aerodynamic and aero-acoustic
applications.

Classical LBM solvers have found their success due to three main
reasons: (i) ability to tackle complex geometries in a simple way,
(ii) low dissipation owing to the streaming step, and (iii) a reduced
computational cost due to the stencil compactness and octree structure.
These advantages come at the cost of a heavier memory load (with
more degrees of freedom), a complex treatment of boundary condi-
tions (owing to the non body-fitted mesh), and filtering problems in
grid refinement areas where both spatial and time discretizations are
halved/doubled.

Let us now consider the three aforementioned advantages and see
if they apply to LBM multiphysics solvers. (i) Ability to tackle complex
geometries is preserved, as the discretization remains identical. (ii) The
low dissipation property is more model dependent. For multiple distri-
bution functions, each distribution is solved using the same algorithm
so that dissipation is supposed to remain identical. For hybrid ap-
proaches, however, a separate numerical scheme is used for energy and
species equations, which may lead to additional dissipation [111] on
the entropy/enthalpy Kovasznay modes. Comparing the computational
cost (iii) between LBM and NS solvers is a long standing issue. While a
thorough comparison is still lacking, some LBM studies report reduced
computational times (RCT), consistently below 5 μs per time step and
grid point for relevant combustion problems [116,117,149,169].

We list in Table 2 different references tackling combustion problems
using multi-physics LB solvers (regardless of the strategy). This fast-
expanding list is a clear indication that multi-physics LBM solvers have
now reached sufficient maturity for combustion applications.

4. Conclusion and discussion

Extension of the LBM to the simulation of combustion happened
slower than other areas of application such as incompressible and
multi-phase flows. Nevertheless the progress documented in recent
years laid the ground and provided guidelines for widespread use and
application of LB to combustion. The complex simulations reported
in the literature, see for instance [120,149,155,159], show that the
numerical approach has reached a level of maturity allowing it to be
applied to realistic configurations. In this contribution we focused on
the development of LB-based approaches to model combustion and
discussed some of the most pressing challenges and solutions proposed
in the literature.

The evolution of the literature shows that one of the major chal-
lenges preventing progress in that area was the development of stable
and efficient solutions to extend the LB solvers to compressible regimes.
Stability has been one of the most restricting issues in that area. While
use of higher order lattices is one straightforward approach to move
up to compressible flows, it has been observed that apart from the
additional memory and computation costs stemming from the larger
number of discrete velocities, higher-order quadrature are subject to
more restrictive stability conditions, especially on the temperature. This
has led the community to opt for approaches relying on low-order

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience102(2024)10114016

quadratures, i.e. third-order, which had shortcomings regarding the NS-
level viscous stress tensor due to insufficient degrees of freedom in the
model. Introduction of correction terms for the viscous stress tensor
along with more robust collision operators has now paved the way for
simulations involving large temperature variations.

Other issues specific to the simulation of combustion in the con-
text of the LBM are tied to additional balance equations for species
and energy. A number of different strategies have been devised for
these additional fields. Some rely on developing kinetic models and,
therefore, LB solvers for multi-species fluids, while others prefer ei-
ther LB-based passive scalar solvers or classical FV/FD solvers for the
balance equations, leading to a hybrid formulation.

While state-of-the-art LB solvers are now increasingly used for
complex combustion configurations involving complex geometries and
turbulent flows, a number of technical challenges still persist:

• One aspect of LBM not discussed in details in the present con-
tribution – as it is not specific to LBM simulation of reacting
flows – is the topic of boundary conditions. In LBM the topic
of boundary conditions consists in providing closure for discrete
distribution functions coming into fluid nodes from neighboring
solid nodes. A large number of approaches have been proposed
in the literature; These include heuristic approaches such as the
well-known bounce back scheme [171,172] or hydrodynamic
constraint-based closures for reconstruction of missing popula-
tions, see for instance [173–175]. As for FD or FV solvers dealing
with complex geometries, stability, accuracy and conservation
properties have been a topic of discussion and improvement. For
instance, accuracy consideration prompted the development of
curved boundary bounce back models such as [176]. Since then
a number of boundary treatments have shown to maintain the
second-order accuracy of the LBM, see for instance [175]. One
of the remaining challenges is to get exactly conservative curved
boundary conditions for the LB solver. While the bare half-way
bounce-back method resulting in a stair-case approximation to
the geometry [171,172] ensures mass conservation, all curved
treatment presented in the literature, see for instance [176–178],
result in loss of conservativity of the boundary condition. For a
more detailed discussion on conservation issues for curved bound-
ary treatment interested readers are referred to [39,179,180]. A
number of routes can be taken to overcome this issue such as
the use of immersed boundaries which would come at the cost of
diffuse interfaces, or the use of volumetric/flux based boundary
treatments, see for instance [181,182].

• Development and implementation of conservative and efficient
dynamic grid-refinement strategies is also another topic to be
further developed in the future. Although grid-refinement in the
context of the LBM has been developed and used since the late
90’s, see for instance [183–188], mass-conservation, spurious
currents at refinement interfaces and dynamic refinement are still
topics of discussion in the literature.

At the end of this detailed review regarding past achievements obtained
for combustion thanks to LB simulations, it is now time to look briefly
to the future. This work is obviously not the first review concerning LB
simulations, and previous studies have sometimes included long-term
perspectives, most prominently in the work by Succi [189] – recently
updated in [190]. It is obviously necessary to evaluate again recent
evolutions in the light of those predictions. One must keep in mind
that applications are in the focus of the present review, as stated in
the title, so that it does not appear meaningful to include exceedingly
exotic concepts here.

In the same manner, the future of high-fidelity combustion simula-
tions has been discussed in previous reviews, for instance [191–193].
Here also, reflecting on the corresponding statements will be useful.
Of course, the aspects already discussed at length in the core of the

present article will not be repeated here in the interest of space. Since
the focus has been placed on important methodological aspects of LB in
this review, a bird’s view seems more appropriate to finish. As such, the
main points emerging for the foreseeable future would read as follows.

• Coupling of different model approaches: even after having re-
viewed the many advantages of LB in this article, it remains
clear that alternative model formulations may be very attractive
from a numerical or an algorithmic point of view for specific
applications. The coupling of LB to FD or FV has been extensively
described in the section concerning hybrid models. In a similar
manner, coupling LB to a variety of other approaches is feasible
and attractive for corresponding problems, also when involving
reacting flows. Integrating the Immersed Boundary Method (IBM)
within a LB framework is particularly relevant for reactive par-
ticles [194]. To take into account even more complex physical
interactions within particulate flows, a coupling of LB with the
Discrete Element Method (DEM) is the next logical step [195]. For
configurations involving clearly separated fluid regions, adding
a Volume of Fluid (VOF) approach – or related methods like
Volume of Pixel – appears as a promising solution [196].

• Multi-physics and multiscale applications, adaptivity: the growing
performance of existing computational platforms coming with
the ever-increasing complexity of the target applications, prob-
lems involving a variety of physical and chemical processes –
mostly coupled in a strongly non-linear manner – and taking place
over a broad diversity of scales in time and space progressively
become the rule. While concentrating here on combustion ap-
plications, it must still be recognized that LB has now virtually
been used successfully for almost any kind of flows (and even
beyond fluid mechanics). The next step – certainly soon to be
reached – will for example involve accurate LB simulations of
turbulent multiphase reacting flows including realistic chemistry,
thermodynamics, and transport models for species and heat, up
to radiative heat transfer.
Such multi-physics configurations typically involve a broad range
of relevant scales in time and space [197], from micrometers to
centimeters for living beings [198], or even ‘‘from inside protons
to the outer Universe’’, citing the optimistic statement of [190].
In that case, an optimal combination of different numerical ap-
proaches will become necessary to allow for a numerical solution
of the full configuration, for instance by coupling LB to Molecular
Dynamics simulations [199–201]. Multiscale issues can be partly
mitigated by using adaptivity — in particular in space for LB
(local grid refinement/coarsening), a solution that has already
been discussed in this review [149,202], and also using adaptive
lattices, see for instance [203].

• Integration of Machine Learning: the incredibly fast development
of Machine Learning (ML) approaches will obviously not leave
LB untouched, since it is increasingly supporting all approaches
used for flow simulations. Regarding more specifically LB for
combustion applications – usually taking place in the turbulent
regime – two lines of research will certainly be followed in the
near future. One will concentrate on the thermoreactive part of
the problem, for instance using Deep Neural Networks to describe
kinetics, potentially leading to very large savings in computing
time and memory [204]. The other line will concentrate on ML
at subgrid scale (SGS) when using LB for Large-Eddy Simulations
(LES) of turbulent reacting flows [149,155]. In that case, either
the behavior of the pure turbulent flow will be described by a SGS
model based on ML [205] – an approach now well established in
conventional CFD [206]; or ML could be used to represent directly
turbulent/combustion coupling at subgrid scale, an even more
challenging but potentially more rewarding solution, for which
much remains to be done [207].

• New computational architectures: Though this might not be im-
mediately clear for young scientists, the performance of a nu-
merical approach is not constrained only by considerations from
applied mathematics (stability, convergence, dissipation, disper-
sion), but is also directly impacted by the details of the compu-
tational architecture on which large-scale simulations are carried
out. As discussed on multiple occasions in the present contribu-
tion, the major advantage of LBM lies in the hyperbolic nature of
all equations and the discretization scheme resulting in compact
stencils, lower communication overhead – due to the explicit
nature of the scheme – and low intensity of discrete opera-
tions. Compared to projection-based zero Mach number solvers
for NS, this constitutes a major advantage for vector computing
and parallelization. The advent of low intensity many-arithmetic-
unit processors such as Graphical Processing Units (GPU) further
stresses on this advantage. However, it might be argued that
hyperbolic nature, compactness of stencil and low communica-
tion overhead in fully explicit FV or FD solvers of order two
for NS models not relying on projection is similar to LBM. For
instance, even in the low Mach regime, a number of studies have
reported computation times comparable to LBM with the artificial
compressibility method – and more efficient variants such as the
kinetically reduced local NS equations [208] – on parallel CPU
systems, see for instance [209,210]. However, the same studies
report that while the latter had performances similar to LBM on
CPUs, LBM was faster on GPUs — probably due to the much
lower complexity of discrete operations [209,210]. Furthermore,
a number of studies have observed that LBM introduces consid-
erably less numerical dissipation into the numerical solution as
compared to equivalent order FV or FD solvers [116,209,210].
Since no formal large-scale studies, especially on GPUs, have
been reported this is still a topic of discussion and debate in the
literature. In his review from 2015, Succi [189] mentioned the
suitability of LB for Quantum Computing (QC). Indeed, porting
high-order CFD methods involving unstructured grids on QC sys-
tems sounds like a nightmare, and LB could here again profit from
its apparent simplicity and locality. LBM on Quantum Computers
is a subject of current research [211,212]. Still, QC systems being
currently barely available for researchers, the impact of Quantum
Computing on future LB simulations cannot be reliably estimated.
The same applies to even more exotic architectures like biological
computers, that have not even entered a preliminary test-phase.
