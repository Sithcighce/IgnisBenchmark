This article covers key and representative developments in the area of high efficiency and clean internal
combustion engines. The main objective is to highlight recent efforts to improve (IC) engine fuel effi-
ciency and combustion. Rising fuel prices and stringent emission mandates have demanded cleaner
combustion and increased fuel efficiency from the IC engine. This need for increased efficiency has placed
compression ignition (CI) engines in the forefront compared to spark ignition (SI) engines. However, the
relatively high emission of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) emitted by diesel en-
gines increases their cost and raises environmental barriers that have prevented their widespread use in
certain markets. The desire to increase IC engine fuel efficiency while simultaneously meeting emissions
mandates has thus motivated considerable research. This paper describes recent progress to improve the
fuel efficiency of diesel or CI engines through advanced combustion and fuels research. In particular, a
dual fuel engine combustion technology called “reactivity controlled compression ignition” (RCCI), which
is a variant of Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI), is highlighted, since it provides more
efficient control over the combustion process and has the capability to lower fuel use and pollutant
emissions. This paper reviews recent RCCI experiments and computational studies performed on light-
and heavy-duty engines, and compares results using conventional and alternative fuels (natural gas,
ethanol, and biodiesel) with conventional diesel, advanced diesel and HCCI concepts.

1. Introduction

Diesel engines are widely used for transportation and power-
generation applications because of their high fuel efficiency.
However, diesel engines can cause environmental pollution owing
to their high NOx and soot emissions. Considerable effort has thus
been devoted toward reducing these pollutant emissions as these
have adverse effects on the environment and human health [1].
Revolutionary in-cylinder combustion strategies and exhaust
emission aftertreatment systems are required to meet stringent
emission regulations. Emission aftertreatment devices, however,
have problems in terms of their cost and durability. Since emission
aftertreatment systems such as Diesel Particulate Filters (DPF), Lean
NOx Trap (LNT) and Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems also
in-cylinder technologies for
often increase fuel consumption,
emission reduction have therefore been the focus of
intense
research [2]. Indeed, the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and
Department of Energy (DOE) have formed a partnership for a
program targeting a 25e40% improvement in fuel economy in light
duty vehicles and the attainment of 55% brake thermal efficiency in
heavy-duty engine systems. Developing engine technologies to
achieve these targets while meeting emission mandates will
require substantial research progress, even beyond that made so
far. The NSF/DOE program solicitation [3] provides more informa-
tion on “big picture” challenges that may be the focus of research in
the next few years.

From the above discussion it is inferred that to maximize overall
engine efficiency, an engine should minimize the need for after-
treatment emission reduction. Accordingly, reduction of NOx and
soot in-cylinder has been investigated by many researchers. Most of
the current strategies can be placed in the category of premixed
Low Temperature Combustion (LTC). Lower combustion tempera-
tures result in NOx reduction due to the high activation energy of
the NO formation reactions [4]. In addition, utilizing long ignition
delay times allows adequate time for mixing prior to the start of
combustion; thus, rich regions in the combustion chamber are
reduced and soot formation is inhibited.

In an effort to reduce NOx and soot emissions in-cylinder, while
maintaining high thermal efficiency, many new compression igni-
tion combustion strategies have been proposed. One of the simplest
methods of achieving low NOx and soot emissions in a CI engine is
HCCI combustion. Although HCCI combustion appears to be

thermodynamically attractive, the controllability challenge (igni-
tion timing control and rate of heat release control) raised by the
HCCI concept over conventional engines, which results from the
near constant volume combustion, leads to very rapid rates of heat
release and hence a very rapid rates of pressure rise. In order to
maintain control over the combustion process on a cycle-to-cycle
basis, coupling between the fuel injection event and the combus-
tion event is desired [5]. This has prompted a trend in the engine
research community to study PCCI combustion, which is a hybrid
between HCCI and conventional DICI combustion. In order to
maintain the coupling between the start of fuel injection and the
start of combustion, in the case of PCCI the fuel is injected early
during the compression stroke to promote fuel-air mixing before
ignition and thus can avoid high NOx and soot formation rates.

Many researchers have shown that HCCI and premixed charge
compression ignition (PCCI) concepts are promising techniques for
simultaneous NOx and soot reduction [6e12]. In addition to sig-
nificant NOx and soot reductions, premixed LTC operation can
provide fuel efficiency advantages due to reduced combustion
duration and lower heat transfer (HT) losses. But HCCI and PCCI
combustion generally suffer from high levels of carbon monoxide
in
(CO) and unburnt hydrocarbon (UHC) emissions. However,
recent years several researchers have demonstrated that boosted
HCCI and PCCI combustion can exhibit nearly 100 per cent com-
bustion efficiency [13,14]. These improvements came through the
use of piston designs featuring minimum crevice volumes, as well
as use of high intake pressures.

A recent review of the fundamental phenomena governing HCCI
operation is given by Saxena et al. [15] who placed particular
emphasis on high load conditions. Emissions characteristics were
discussed, with suggestions on how to inexpensively enable low
emissions of all regulated emissions. First, a review of hydrocarbon
fuel decomposition was presented, including the chemical path-
ways for low and intermediate temperature chemistry and hot
ignition. The characteristics of different fuels were discussed, with
focus on single- and two-stage ignition, the influence of molecular
structure on fuel vaporization, and the fuel characteristic referred
to as F sensitivity. Next, the importance of the in-cylinder charge
conditions was discussed. This included a review of different types
of EGR and its effects, and the importance of thermal and mixture
stratification. The operating limits that govern high load operation
were also discussed in detail, and finally a review of recent

research, which expands the high load limits of HCCI, was dis-
cussed. Although this article focused on the fundamental phe-
nomena governing HCCI operation,
for
understanding the fundamental phenomena in other kinetically
controlled combustion concepts, including reactivity controlled
fuel stratification (PFS),
compression ignition (RCCI), partial
partially premixed compression ignition, spark-assisted HCCI, and
all forms of low temperature combustion (LTC).

it was also useful

Saxena et al. [15] systematically identified the fundamental
phenomena influencing operation at high load and concluded that,
despite the substantial improvements to LTC engines in recent
years, additional research challenges still remain. They pointed out
that more research is required to translate promising high load
operating strategies to cover the full engine load and speed ranges,
while simultaneously addressing the control complexities that
occur in multi-cylinder engines. Better understanding is required of
the chemical kinetic processes leading to intermediate temperature
heat release with certain fuels, and better explanations are required
to understand the reported qualitative observation that fuels that
exhibit Low Temperature Heat Release (LTHR) tend to be more
sensitive to equivalence ratio (F-sensitivity). As ringing (large
amplitude pressure oscillations) is one of the principal constraints
that dictate high load limits, better fundamental understanding is
required of this phenomena. Research efforts to improve the ring-
ing intensity correlation are underway, and better quantitative
understandings of how ringing impacts heat loss being obtained.
Unburned hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions from
certain LTC operating regimes are also a problem that requires
further research, and aftertreatment technologies must be devel-
oped to address this problem while considering the lower exhaust
gas temperatures from LTC and HCCI engines. Finally, Saxena et al.
[15] concluded that beyond simply expanding the load limits,
better integration of LTC engines in power generation or vehicle
powertrain systems is required. To cite a specific example, practical
deployment of high load LTC or HCCI engines will require turbo-
chargers that are designed for the unique operating conditions of
these engines.

Musculus et al. [16] described recent research in optically
accessible engines and combustion chambers, and proposed con-
ceptual models for low temperature combustion (LTC). The models
are based on multiple optical diagnostic observations and homo-
geneous reactor simulations using detailed chemical kinetic
mechanisms. The models describe low-load, single-injection,
partially premixed compression ignition conditions with high EGR
rates (oxygen concentrations in the range of 10e15%), and consider
the spray formation, vaporization, mixing, ignition, and pollutant
formation and destruction mechanisms that are consistent with
experimental observations in LTC diesel engines. Two separate
subcategories were offered for either heavy-duty, large-bore or for
light-duty, small-bore engines. Relative to the conventional diesel
conceptual model of Dec et al. [17], the features of LTC conceptual
models include longer liquid-fuel penetration, an extended ignition
delay that allows more premixing of fuel, a more distinct and
temporally extended two-stage ignition, more spatially uniform
second-stage ignition, reduced and altered soot formation regions,
and increased over-mixing, leading to incomplete combustion.

Extensive research has also been conducted on diesel PCCI at
Lund University [18], which has revealed that the traditional NOx e
soot trade-off that exists in conventional diesel combustion can be
defeated by diesel PCCI with high EGR rates in excess of 65% and use
of a reduced compression ratio (e.g., 12.4). The high levels of EGR
required the reduced compression ratio and, in addition, wall
wetting issues associated with early injection of diesel fuel (due to
its high boiling point) showed that diesel fuel is not an ideal
candidate for PCCI operation. Kalghatgi et al. [19] discovered that,

for a given set of operating conditions and the same combustion
phasing, operation with less reactive gasoline produced a much
longer ignition delay, which facilitates premixed combustion,
resulting in lower NOx and soot emissions. Accordingly, gasoline
PCCI has been studied by many engine researchers (e.g., Dec et al.
[20], and Dempsey and Reitz [21]).

Indeed, experiments conducted by Bessonette et al. [22] sug-
gested that the best fuel for HCCI-type operation may have auto-
ignition qualities between those of diesel fuel and gasoline. Gaso-
line's resistance to auto-ignition can be exploited to extend the pre-
combustion mixing time, but at low load the poor auto-ignition
qualities of gasoline can make it difficult to achieve combustion.
Conversely, diesel fuel has better auto-ignition qualities, but re-
quires high levels of EGR for appropriate combustion phasing as the
engine load increases.

Similarly, Park et al. [23] also investigated the effect of blending
gasoline with diesel on fuel properties, droplet atomization, com-
bustion performance, and exhaust emission characteristics of gas-
olineediesel direct blended fuels in a four-cylinder diesel engine
with a common rail system. In this study it was found that the
gasoline fraction decreased the fuel density, kinematic viscosity,
and surface tension. The droplet size of the fuel was measured
using a phase Doppler particle analyser (PDPA). Park et al.'s inves-
tigation revealed that addition of gasoline reduced the temperature
of the 10% distillation point and decreased the droplet size due to
increased droplet instability due to decreased surface tension. The
results also indicated that the addition of gasoline extended the
ignition delay and thus provided a more homogeneous mixture.
These combustion characteristics caused the simultaneous reduc-
tion in NOx and Soot emission. Thus, the investigation provided
valuable insights about the effect of blending gasoline with diesel.
An experimental investigation was carried out by Valentino
et al. [24] to study the performance and emissions of a high speed
diesel engine fueled with n-butanol/diesel blends on a turbo-
charged, water cooled, DI diesel engine, equipped with a common
rail injection system. This work aimed at achieving simultaneous
reduction in NOx and smoke emissions, without significant pen-
alties on engine efficiency using fuel blends with a low cetane
number and high resistance to auto ignition under premixed low
temperature combustion conditions. In that context, n-butanol was
identified as a fuel for blending with diesel. The higher volatility
and high resistance to auto ignition quality of n-butanol-diesel (20%
and 40% of n-butanol by volume) blends improved engine emis-
sions with a low penalty on fuel consumption.

Inagaki et al. [25] investigated dual-fuel (premixed iso-octane
and direct injected diesel) premixed compression ignition (PCI)
operation with the objective of reducing the EGR requirements of
PCI strategies. In that investigation, they were able to operate up to
12 bar IMEP in the PCI mode. From these studies it can be concluded
that different fuel blends could be required at different operating
conditions, i.e., a high cetane fuel at light load and a low cetane fuel
at high load. Thus, it is desirable to have the capability to operate
with fuel blends covering the spectrum from neat gasoline to neat
diesel fuel, depending on the operating regime. Accordingly, one
strategy proposes the injection of low cetane number (CN) fuel (low
reactivity fuel) in the intake port, and early cycle DI of high cetane
number fuel (high reactivity fuel). This has been called RCCI by
Kokjohn et al. [26]. RCCI is a dual fuel engine combustion tech-
nology that uses in-cylinder fuel blending with at least two fuels of
different reactivity, and multiple injections to control the in-
cylinder fuel reactivity to optimize the combustion phasing, dura-
tion and magnitude. The process involved in RCCI includes the
introduction of a low reactivity fuel into the cylinder to create a
well-mixed charge of low reactivity fuel, air and recirculated gases.
The high reactivity fuel is then injected before ignition of the

16

R.D. Reitz, G. Duraisamy / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 46 (2015) 12e71

premixed fuel using single or multiple injections directly into the
combustion chamber.

The RCCI concept has been shown to provide better control of
combustion compared to other strategies, such as dual fuel HCCI,
dual fuel PCCI and single fuel PPC, and high thermal efficiencies
approaching 60% have been demonstrated with this concept. Thus,
the present review emphasizes experimental and computational
works on RCCI using a variety of fuel combinations, including
gasolineediesel (G/D), ethanolediesel (E/D), gasolineebiodiesel
and gasolineegasoline with small additions of cetane number
improver (2-EHN and DTBP). In this paper gasolineegasoline doped
with 2-EHN or DTBP is also referred to as a “single fuel” strategy
since so little additive is required, and other fuel combinations are
referred to as dual-fuel strategies.

2. Experimental engine and computational models

RCCI combustion has been investigated on Heavy-Duty (HD) and
Light-Duty (LD) engines at the Engine Research Center (ERC) of
UW-Madison and at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The
heavy-duty engine is a 2.44 L Caterpillar 3401 single cylinder oil
test engine (SCOTE) and the light-duty engines include single cyl-
inder and four-cylinder General Motors (GM) 1.9-L common rail
diesel engines. The HD engine EGR system comprises an electrically
driven supercharger and a diesel particulate filter (DPF), to prevent
fouling of the EGR cooler and supercharger. The EGR supercharger
was implemented as a pump to maintain constant EGR levels with
constant surge tank pressures as the DPF fills. Conversely, the use of
the supercharger in this manner allows experimentation with more
than practical turbocharger efficiency levels, especially if the
pressure difference between the intake and exhaust surge tanks is
small. However, effort was made to avoid such conditions. The
multi-cylinder LD engine is also equipped with a variable geometry
turbocharger (VGT), and an electronic EGR valve with a high
pressure loop EGR cooling system. The HD and LD engine geome-
tries are shown in Tables 1 and 2 and the experimental set ups are
shown in Figs. 1 and 2.

2.1. ERC engine specifications

2.1.1. Heavy-duty engine data acquisition systems and hardware

In the ERC's heavy duty engine the cylinder pressure was
measured with a Kistler model 6043 Asp/6061C water-cooled
pressure transducer in conjunction with a Kistler model 510
charge amplifier. Acquired cylinder pressure traces were averaged
for 500 cycles. Intake air flow was measured using choked flow
orifices. To obtain choked flow for a variety of engine operating
conditions, combinations of six different sized orifices were used to
gain the desired intake air flow rate. The intake air was heated with
two immersion-style heaters with PID control to ±1 (cid:2)C. Both the
intake and exhaust system surge tank pressures were equipped
with PID control to ±0.7 kPa. PM measurements were performed
with an AVL model 415S smoke meter. PM measurements of FSN,
mass per volume (mg/m3), and specific emissions (g/kWh) were
related with the factory AVL calibration and averaged between five
samples of a 2 L volume each with paper-saving mode off. All
gaseous emissions measurements were performed with a five gas
emissions bench. The EGR rate was determined through the ratio of
intake CO2 to exhaust CO2 levels. Gaseous emissions were averaged
for 30 s after attaining steady state operation.

2.1.2. Light-duty engine data acquisition systems and hardware

In the ERC and ORNL LD engines high speed combustion data
was acquired using Kistler model 6058A pressure sensors installed
in the glow plug ports of all 4 cylinders. Individual Kistler type 5010

dual-mode amplifiers were used to process the pressure signals
and a combustion package from National Instruments (Drivven)
was used to process the data. Cylinder pressure was pegged to the
intake manifold pressure near the end of the intake stroke. Pressure
was taken at 0.2(cid:2) crank angle intervals and resolved for 500 cycles.
Engine performance and emissions data were sampled at 1 Hz
within the Dyne Systems Cell Assistant data acquisition program.
Diesel fuel flow measurement was carried out using a Micro Motion
CMF type Coriolis mass flow sensor. Gasoline fuel flow was
measured gravimetrically using a Sartorius CP34001S weighing
balance connected to the low speed data acquisition system. Steady
state engine-out carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), hy-
drocarbon (HC), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and oxygen (O2) con-
centrations were measured using California Analytical gas
analyzers. PM emissions were monitored by measuring the filter
smoke number (FSN) using the AVL model 415s smoke meter.

The engine and injection controls were managed using the
National Instruments Labview based Drivven control unit, which
was equipped with the injector drivers for both direct injection (DI)
of diesel fuel and port fuel injection (PFI) of gasoline. The same
controller was able to simultaneously manage both injection sys-
tems while running the engine map. The Drivven system allows for
full user control over engine parameters and was programmed to
allow individual
for start-of-injection (SOI)
timing, number of injection events and injection duration for each
DI diesel injector, as well as injection duration for each PFI gasoline
injector. This setup allowed the operator to manually adjust the
fueling duration and timing for cylinder-to-cylinder balancing. This
setup also allows for dual-fuel operation in a single or a few cyl-
inders, while traditional diesel-only operation can be maintained in
the other cylinders, aiding in diagnostic and troubleshooting. Boost
pressure was controlled by demanding a boost set point using vane
position controls on the variable geometry turbocharger. The intake

charge temperature was controlled by adjusting the amount of
process water to an air-to-water charge air cooler. This was done
manually using a ball valve on the inlet side of the charge air cooler
allowing the intake temperature to be controlled to within a few

degrees. The test engine was equipped with a variable swirl actu-
ator in one of the intake ports. A fully open swirl valve (minimum
swirl ratio) and a fully closed valve (maximum swirl ratio) corre-
spond to a swirl valve angle of 0(cid:2) and 90(cid:2), respectively.

The intake manifold was modified to allow the PFI injectors to
spray directly into the non-swirl actuated intake port of the engine.
The gasoline PFI injectors at cylinders 2, 3 and 4 were positioned
similar to traditional PFI installations, however, the position of the
cam-driven high pressure fuel pump necessitated the installation
location of the PFI injector for cylinder 1 to be on top of the intake
manifold and aimed at the intake port as shown in Fig. 3. This was
preferred rather than modifying the high-pressure fuel pump for
the diesel fuel injection system, since cylinder 1 is located at the
end of the intake manifold and the PFI injector has a narrow spray
angle such that the fuel should get into the port without much mass
transfer to the other cylinders.

An automotive fuel pump and a custom fuel rail were installed
to meet the needs of the PFI gasoline system. The fuel rail was
mounted on a support near the engine and connected to each
injector with braided metal covered fuel lines. An automotive
pressure regulator was used to maintain the correct rail pressure of
380 kPa. Fig. 4 shows the installed gasoline fuel system. The return
flow from the gasoline fuel rail was cooled and returned to the
supply line downstream of the fuel flow meter.

2.1.3. ERC computational models

Engine combustion simulations were performed using the
KIVA-3v release 2 code [27] with improvements to many physical
and chemistry models, which have been developed at the ERC
[28e31]. The KIVA-3v code was coupled with the CHEMKIN II
solver for detailed chemistry calculations.
In the models the
chemistry of gasoline and diesel fuel were represented by iso-
octane and n-heptane, respectively. A reduced reaction mecha-
nism made up of 45 species and 142 reactions [32] described the
combined oxidation of n-heptane and iso-octane, since many
studies (e.g., Ra and Reitz [33]) have shown that the combustion
characteristics of gasoline and diesel are closely represented by iso-
octane (i.e., PRF 100) and n-heptane (i.e., PRF 0), respectively. This
approach has also been shown to yield acceptable agreement for
blends of gasoline and diesel fuel (e.g., Kokjohn et al. [8], Hanson
et al. [34], and Splitter et al. [35]).

The physical properties of diesel fuel for spray and mixing
processes were represented by tetradecane. Of course, the multi-
component vaporization of the actual diesel fuel used in the ex-
periments was not captured by this approach (i.e., the distillation
curve of diesel fuel is not reproduced). Therefore, it is possible that
differences between single and multicomponent vaporization
result in differences in the fuel distribution prior to and during
combustion. Indeed, PCCI combustion has been shown to be very

sensitive to the mixture preparation details (e.g., Opat et al. [12]);
therefore, the use of simplified fuel models should be borne in mind
when assessing observed differences between simulations and
experiments.

Soot was predicted using a phenomenological soot model based
on the approach of Hiroyasu and Kadota [36]. The soot model used
acetylene as an inception species, which allows the soot model to
be coupled to the chemistry solver through the addition of 13 re-
actions involving acetylene. NOx emissions were predicted using a
reduced NO mechanism [37] consisting of four additional species
and 12 reactions. The spray model used the Lagrangian-drop and
Eulerian Fluid (LDEF) approach. In order to reduce the grid size
dependency of the LDEF spray model and to allow accurate spray
simulation on a relatively coarse grid, the gas-jet model of Abani
et al. [29,30] was used to model the relative velocity between the
droplets and gas phase in the under-resolved near-nozzle region.
Their approach assumes that the relative velocity between a
droplet and the gas phase is equal to that between the droplet and a
turbulent gas-jet with the same mass and momentum of that of the
injected fuel.

Droplet breakup was modeled using the hybrid KHeRT model
described by Beale and Reitz [28]. The droplet collision model was
based on O'Rourke's model [38]; however, a radius of influence
method is used to determine the possible collision partners to
further reduce mesh dependency [39]. In addition, the collision
model was expanded by Munnannur [40] to include a more
comprehensive range of collision outcomes. The implementation of
the droplet collision model considered the effects of bounce, coa-
lescence, and fragmenting and non-fragmenting separations.
Droplet interactions with the wall were considered through a wall

spreading, and motion due to inertia. The simulations were per-
formed using the three-dimensional computational grids shown in
Fig. 5. To reduce the computational burden, a 60(cid:2) sector mesh that
considers a single nozzle hole of a six nozzle hole injector with
periodic boundaries was used. Notice that the region above the top
piston ring is resolved; however, ring motion and flows past the
compression rings are not included.

2.1.4. Fuel and injector details

The ERC and ORNL RCCI engine experiments were performed
using port fuel injection of gasoline/ethanol and early direct in-
jection of diesel/B20/gasoline-with-DTBP/and gasoline-with-2-
EHN using a conventional (i.e., wide angle, large nozzle hole)
common-rail injector and a GDI injector. The properties of the fuels
and specifications for the port fuel, common rail and GDI injectors
used in the engines are given in Tables 3e7, respectively.

2.1.5. Fuel introduction strategies

The RCCI engine experiments were performed using port fuel
injection of a lower reactivity fuel and early direct injection of a
higher reactivity fuel with a conventional solenoid operated com-
mon rail injector. A lubricity additive was added at around 500 ppm
to the common rail fuel system during “single fueling” strategies
(i.e., gasoline and gasoline doped with 2-EHN/DTBP) to provide
adequate injector lubrication. In the RCCI studies, gasoline was
injected very early in the cycle and the reactive fuel was injected
using a double injection strategy later in the cycle. An example of
the injection timing windows of the DI event is shown in Fig. 6. The
DI strategy utilized only early injection to raise the reactivity of the
fuel in the squish region near the cylinder liner and a second in-
jection closer to top dead center (TDC) to increase the reactivity in
the center of the cylinder. The timings, duration and fuel quantity
varies with the operating conditions.

3. Results and discussion

Low Temperature Combustion investigations carried out on the
ERC and ORNL engines described above over wide ranges of oper-
ating conditions are reviewed. The use of CFD modeling to guide
the experimental work is also discussed.

reactivity was investigated by Kokjohn et al. [26]. In-cylinder fuel
blending was proposed as the fuel delivery and blending strategy to
adjust the fuel reactivity on a cycle-to-cycle basis by changing the
injected quantities of gasoline and diesel fuel to optimally accom-
modate engine load and speed changes. A preliminary experi-
mental study at an engine load of 6 bar IMEP was performed in the
HD engine using port fuel injection of gasoline and direct injection
of diesel fuel near BDC using a low pressure GDI injector. The
operating conditions are given in Table 8. Fig. 7 shows the cylinder
pressure and heat release rates over an EGR sweep at 6 bar IMEP
and 1300 rev/min. The simulations were run from IVC to EVO using

a two-dimensional sector grid representation of the combustion
chamber. At IVC a homogeneous mixture of iso-octane, n-heptane,
residuals/EGR, and air was assumed. The simulations captured the
combustion characteristics reasonably well. However, the peak
cylinder pressure and AHRR were slightly over predicted due to the
neglected spatial inhomogeneity in fuel/EGR/air mixture. But, the
results were extremely useful to provide guidelines for the selec-
tion of combustion strategies, as described next.

3.1.1. Selection of baseline fuel reactivity and EGR

The KIVA-CHEMKIN code and a reduced PRF mechanism were
used to find optimized fuel blends and EGR combinations for HCCI
operation at several engine loads. The study found that a minimum
fuel consumption could not be achieved using either neat diesel
fuel or neat gasoline alone, and that the optimal fuel reactivity
required decreased with increasing load [13,14]. Fig. 8 shows the
simulation results at 6 bar IMEP, and it is seen that when PRF 70
was used, the optimal combustion phasing could be achieved with
no EGR. Thus, the reduced fuel reactivity could significantly reduce
the burden on the air handling system. Furthermore, the ability to
operate at low EGR rates may be beneficial for combustion phasing
control during transient LTC operation. The optimal CA50 com-
bustion phasing for 6 bar IMEP operation was found to be between
4 and 6(cid:2) aTDC. Similarly, Fig. 9 shows simulation results at 11 bar
IMEP that indicates that low ISFC can be achieved using PRF blends
ranging from 60 to 90, depending on the EGR level. The minimum
ISFC coincided with a CA50 of ~6(cid:2) aTDC. Furthermore, as load was
increased, operation had to be shifted to higher EGR levels in order
to reduce the rate of heat release and to meet the PPRR constraint. It
was observed that, even with combustion phasing after TDC, the
PPRR was excessive (~20e30 bar/deg) due to the volumetric heat
release, and it was inferred that stratification may be useful to
control the rate of heat release.

3.1.2. Dual-fuel operation

The outcome of the preliminary study conducted to select
baseline PRF and EGR levels indicated that it is possible to improve
fuel economy by optimizing the fuel reactivity for each specific
operating condition. The investigations assumed a perfectly

homogeneous mixture, which is likely to be unrealistic. However,
similar results were achieved using production-type hardware for
this engine. Dual-fuel operation was explored using port fuel in-
jection of gasoline and early multiple injection of diesel fuel with a
conventional diesel injector. The experimental results confirmed
that an extension of the PCCI operating regime was possible when
optimized fuel blends were used. The operating conditions for the
dual-fuel PCCI operation at 6 and 11 bar IMEP are shown in Table 9.
Fig. 10 shows the measured and simulated cylinder pressure and
heat release rate for dual-fuel PCCI operation at 6 bar IMEP. It is
seen that the model predicted the combustion characteristics well
at this condition. It was thought that the over prediction of the
ignition delay was due to uncertainties in the initial and boundary
conditions, rather than due to short comings of the physical
models. The performance and emissions results are shown in
Table 10. Comparisons of the predicted and measured emissions
show that the models were able to predict NOx, CO and ISFC
extremely well. However, significant under prediction of soot was
observed due to the inhomogeneities at IVC (not modeled), which
may have contributed to the differences in the predicted and
measured soot levels. Note however that the soot levels are
extremely low.

The results confirmed that the use of optimized fuel reactivity
provides control of the combustion phasing and spatially stratified
reactivity extends the combustion duration. Thus, the ability of the
strategy to extend the operating range of low emission, high effi-
ciency PCCI combustion to higher engine loads (e.g., 11 bar IMEP)
was explored. Fig. 11 shows the cylinder pressure and heat release
rates over a gasoline percentage sweep. The simulations agree very
well with the experimental cylinder pressures and heat release
rates. The heat release rate curves show evidence of a cool flame
reaction from the diesel fuel, followed by two distinct bumps on the
high temperature heat release. It was thought that the first bump
corresponds to high temperature oxidation of CO formed from
oxidation of the diesel fuel and the second bump corresponds to
oxidation of CO formed from the gasoline breakdown.

The performance and emissions of dual-fuel operation at 11 bar
IMEP is shown in Fig. 12. The simulations were able to predict NOx
emissions very well, but soot was significantly under predicted.
However, the soot levels in the experiments were well below US
2010 heavy-duty limits. The CO prediction shows reasonable
agreement, but HC was slightly overpredicted. However, the trend

of increasing HC with increasing gasoline percentage was captured.
The increase in HC emissions with increasing gasoline percentage
may be due to the increase in fuel trapped in the piston liner crevice
as more gasoline is premixed.

The key feature of the dual fuel approach is the ability to control
the combustion process by optimizing the reactivity of the blended
fuels. This led to the terminology “reactivity controlled compres-
sion ignition” or RCCI, to differentiate the combustion process from
HCCI or PCCI.

3.1.3. Comparison of dual fuel combustion modes

Yu et al. [41] compared their so-called Gasoline Homogeneous
Charge Induced Ignition (HCII) combustion and Gasoline/Diesel
Blend Fuels (GDBF) combustion modes. In the HCII mode port fuel
injection of gasoline was used to form a homogeneous charge and
direct injection of diesel fuel served as the ignition source, while in
the GDBF mode a premixed blend of diesel-gasoline was directly
injected into the cylinder for combustion. The results of this study
demonstrated that the above two methods may integrate the ad-
vantages of gasoline and diesel fuels to achieve high thermal effi-
ciency and low emission targets. Yu et al. investigated these two

combustion modes on a high-pressure common rail single-cylinder
diesel engine. The results show that both HCII and GDBF modes can
achieve higher thermal efficiency than gasoline SI combustion and
a similar or even higher thermal efficiency than diesel CI combus-
tion due to near constant volume combustion. It was noticed that
an increase in gasoline ratio improved the fuel-air mixing and
shortened the combustion duration significantly in both the HCII
and GDBF modes, which, in turn, resulted in a 90% reduction in soot
emissions. Overall, the study demonstrated that in both HCII and
GDBF combustion modes extremely low soot and NO emission is
possible with use of large amounts of EGR.

Yang et al. [42] performed numerical simulations and experi-
ments to explore the differences in combustion and emissions
characteristics between dual-fuel Highly Premixed Charge Com-
bustion (HPCC, including Early-HPCC and Late-HPCC) and blended-
fuel Low Temperature Combustion (LTC) modes with gasoline and
diesel. Their results illustrate that most of the mixture in E-HPCC is
uniform in both concentration and reactivity, while there are
various degrees of mixture stratification in Late-HPCC and LTC.
Based on the in-cylinder charge distributions, the combustion oc-
curs in the very center area of the combustion chamber and in the

area closer to the piston bowl wall in the two HPCCs and LTC
respectively, and then the flame spreads to peripheral regions. In
the two HPCCs, substantial heat release was noticed due to the
oxidation by the OH radical that derived from low temperature
reactions of the diesel fuel, and reasonable MPRR values were
observed due to the staged reactions of diesel and gasoline. The fuel
stratification in the LTC mode resulted in a rapid heat release rate
and high MPRR because of the coupled combustion reactions of
gasoline and diesel in regions of higher fuel concentration. Yang
et al. found that, compared to LTC, the two HPCCs produce more
incomplete combustion products, and consequently lower com-
bustion efficiencies, which could be improved by increasing the
gasoline-diesel fuel ratio.

3.2. Comparison of low temperature combustion strategies

Comparisons of various low temperature combustion strategies
were investigated by Dempsey et al. [5] with focus on engine per-
formance and emissions, combustion sensitivity to intake condi-
tions, and the ability to control observed sensitivities through the
fuel injection strategy. The combustion strategies that were inves-
tigated were fully premixed dual fuel HCCI, dual fuel RCCI, and
single fuel PPC. The study investigated each combustion strategy's
controllability on a cycle-to-cycle basis. The three combustion
strategies were first operated using the primary reference fuels: n-

heptane and iso-octane, to remove fuel effects from comparisons.
In addition, dual fuel RCCI and single fuel PPC were investigated
using commercial pump gasoline and diesel fuel to investigate if
the findings with the reference fuels were transferable to fuels used
in the transportation market today.

The experiments were carried out on a single-cylinder version
of the LD diesel engine shown in Fig. 2. The stock-re-entrant piston
bowl geometry was replaced with a modified piston that featured a
wide shallow bowl, which is shown Fig. 13. In the study the pre-
mixing of fuel and air was accomplished with two port fuel in-
jectors mounted in the intake runner upstream of the intake valves.
For RCCI and PPC operation, a portion of fuel was injected directly
into the cylinder via the centrally mounted common rail injector.
During the HCCI experiments, the injector was replaced with a solid
plug that had the same dimensions as the injector, so as to maintain
the same geometric compression ratio. The specifications of the
injectors used are given in Tables 3 and 4. Table 11 shows the
physical and chemical properties of the fuels used. The different
fueling strategies used in the study are described in Table 12. Prior
to the sensitivity study, the engine's response to changes in the
input fuel system parameters, such as the global fuel reactivity,
premixed fuel amount, and DI timing were studied. First the effect
of varying the premixed fuel amount was demonstrated.

As shown in Fig. 14, when operated on primary reference fuels,
both HCCI and RCCI have a very pronounced ability to target a given
CA50 via slight changes of the global fuel reactivity in the com-
bustion chamber. Single fuel PPC operated on PRF 94 gasoline
demonstrated some level of control, but over a much wider range of
premixed fuel percentage. In addition, when the premixed fuel
percentage was low, the NOx emissions began to increase due to the
existence of high equivalence ratio regions in the combustion
chamber at the start of combustion. PPC and RCCI displayed very
similar trends with pump fuels compared to the primary reference
fuels, as shown in Fig. 14. However, pump fuel RCCI showed less
controllability and increased NOx emissions compared to operation
with the primary reference fuels due to the reduced reactivity
gradient between the premixed and direct injected fuels.

combustion strategies allow combustion phasing control via the
fuel delivery details, and the results obtained from the study were
used as a guide to control combustion phasing via intake
conditions.

3.2.1. Baseline operating conditions

The investigations of Dempsey et al. [5] were continued to study
the sensitivity and controllability of HCCI, RCCI and PPC combustion
for engine conditions. A mid-load operating condition of 5.5 bar
gIMEP and 1500 rev/min was chosen. This condition is represen-
tative of an operating condition that would be experienced in an LD
diesel engine application (Kokjohn, Reitz, [82]), and at this oper-
ating condition the NOx target was ~0.1 g/kWh (0.6 g/kg-fuel). An
intake pressure of 1.3 bar absolute was used for all three combus-
tion strategies and a intake temperature of 50 (cid:2)C was used for HCCI
and RCCI, whereas a slightly higher intake temperature of 70 (cid:2)C was
used for PPC to achieve the target combustion phasing of interest
0 to 5(cid:2) aTDC. Fig. 15 shows the cylinder pressure and apparent heat
release rate and Table 13 summarizes the performance of all the
three baseline operating points shown in Table 14.

RCCI operation with the primary reference fuels yielded a longer
combustion duration and lower peak pressure rise rates compared
to HCCI and PPC. The combustion efficiency of RCCI was the lowest
among the three strategies when operated with PRF fuel. However,
despite the lower combustion efficiency, the gross indicated effi-
ciency (GIE) of RCCI was slightly higher due to lower heat transfer
losses stemming from the lower PPRR. As could be noticed from the
pump fuel results, when the reactivity of the premixed fuel was
increased via the 87 AKI gasoline, the combustion efficiency for
RCCI operation was improved to the same level as for PPC. Fully
premixed HCCI and single fuel PPC displayed very high PPRR. This is
somewhat surprising, but a similar observation was explained by
Dec et al. [17] at low intake pressures (~<1.6 bar) when comparing
fully premixed HCCI with partially stratified charge. They found
that the ignition delay of these fuels (conventional gasoline, iso-
octane, and PRF 94) has very little sensitivity to the mixture
equivalence ratio for equivalence ratios less than 0.5. Thus, for even
relatively large amounts of direct injected fuel, the combustion

One of the major advantages of a partially premixed combustion
strategy is the added control flexibility allowed by varying the
direct fuel's injection timing. For both single fuel PPC and dual fuel
RCCI with pump fuel, a single direct injection with DI timing closer
to TDC was used, which resulted in an advance in combustion
phasing at the cost of increased NOx emissions due to the lower
volatility of gasoline compared to diesel fuel. As the DI timing was
advanced beyond (cid:4)50(cid:2) aTDC, combustion phasing control was
diminished with the PRF fuel for both combustion strategies. This
finding was very consistent for single fuel PPC operation with pump
gasoline. However, for RCCI operation with pump fuels, the com-
bustion phasing continued to respond to changes in DI timing for
timings earlier than (cid:4)50(cid:2) aTDC, most likely due to the low volatility
of diesel fuel. The study clearly demonstrated that the three

operating condition.

Intake temperature sensitivity and controllability: primary

reference fuels

The three strategies displayed significant combustion sensitivity
to changes in the intake temperature. This was expected consid-
ering that the strategies are sufficiently premixed and predomi-
nantly controlled by chemical kinetics, which is driven by the
mixture temperature. Fig. 16 shows the intake temperature sensi-
tivity for the primary reference fuels. An intake temperature
sensitivity correction for dual fuel HCCI was done by varying the
fuel reactivity using the two port injectors, and the baseline com-
bustion phasing was easily recovered for both hotter and colder
intake temperatures through slight modifications of the global fuel
reactivity the DI timing was kept constant). The major difference
with dual fuel HCCI and RCCI was the resulting PPRR. RCCI yielded
significantly lower PPRR than HCCI.

In the case of single fuel PPC with PRF 94 gasoline, for the hotter
intake temperature the baseline combustion phasing was unre-
coverable, despite increasing the premixed fraction from 79.1% to
95.2%. As mentioned before, the baseline operating condition for
single fuel PPC yielded approximately the same combustion

duration as fully premixed HCCI. This suggested that the equiva-
lence ratio distribution created by the baseline injection strategy
was not broad enough to produce a range of ignition delays. Thus, it
was expected that if changes were made to the injection strategy to
create a more premixed charge, the ignition delay will be relatively
unaffected, as observed for the increased intake temperature case.
On the contrary, for the colder intake temperature, by using a
combination of more direct injected fuel and a retarded timing, the
baseline combustion phasing was reasonably recovered. However,
this came at the cost of increased NOx emissions.

Intake pressure sensitivity and controllability: primary

3.2.3.
reference fuels

In addition to intake temperature variations, the sensitivity of
the combustion process to the intake pressure also was investigated
by Dempsey et al. [5]. This is extremely important for the devel-
opment of transient operation of a turbocharged engine, because
under a speed and load transient, the intake pressure changes more
rapidly than the intake temperature. Fig. 17 shows the results of
changing the intake pressure by approximately ±0.1 bar for all
three strategies. The same order of sensitivity to the intake pressure
was observed for HCCI and PPC as there was to the intake tem-
perature. Interestingly, when the intake pressure was reduced, the

PPC with PRF 94 were also extremely consistent with the findings
of intake temperature perturbations.

3.2.4. Combustion phasing sensitivity and controllability: pump
fuels

In order to confirm that the findings were transferable to readily
available market fuels, which contain numerous classes of hydro-
carbon species that may not respond in the same fashion as the
primary reference fuels, Dempsey et al. [5] investigated all the three
strategies in the same manner with pump fuels.

Fig. 18a shows the results of correcting for the observed intake
temperature sensitivity for RCCI operation on pump fuels. The
baseline combustion phasing was reasonably recovered for both
the increased and decreased intake temperature cases. Due to the
small gradient in reactivity between the two pump fuels as
compared to the primary reference fuels, changes to the DI timing
were employed along with changes to the premixed fuel percent-
age in order to recover the baseline phasing for the increased
temperature case. In addition, Fig. 18b also shows the results of
perturbing the intake pressure for RCCI operation on pump fuels
and subsequently correcting the observed sensitivity. The results
were very consistent with the findings for the primary reference
fuels, however, pump fuels and the primary reference fuels display
slightly different sensitivities, both of which, however, were readily
corrected through changes in the fuel injection details.

Fig. 19a shows the results of perturbing the intake temperature
approximately ±10 (cid:2)C for single fuel PPC operation on pump gas-
oline and subsequently attempting to correct for the observed
sensitivity. As can be seen, the sensitivity was very similar between
the pump 87 AKI gasoline and PRF 94, and the results were very
consistent with the findings for PPC operation with PRF 94. For the
increased intake temperature condition, the premixed fuel per-
centage was increased to 91.5% and the DI timing was advanced to
(cid:4)70(cid:2) aTDC, and yet the baseline combustion phasing was unre-
coverable. For the decreased intake temperature condition, the
baseline combustion was recovered by increasing the level of fuel
stratification (i.e., decreased premixed fuel percentage and
retarded DI timing), but the NOx emissions increased to 4.3 g/kg-
fuel, which is significantly above the target level of 0.6 g/kg-fuel. As
can be seen from Fig. 19b, PRF 94 and the 87 AKI gasoline displayed
the same level of sensitivity to the increased intake pressure, but
responded somewhat differently to the decrease in intake pressure.
The ability to correct the combustion phasing sensitivity is very
similar to that of PRF 94. With increased intake pressure it is not
possible to correct for the advancement in combustion phasing. On
the contrary, with decreased intake pressure it is possible to
advance the combustion phasing back to the baseline condition, but
again with a significant increase in the NOx emissions.

The results discussed in this section demonstrated that all three
advanced low temperature combustion concepts, HCCI, PCCI and
RCCI, are sensitive to the intake conditions. This is an expected
result because each strategy is governed by chemical kinetics,
which is known to be controlled by the mixture temperature and

combustion phasing retard for PPC operation was greater than that
observed for HCCI. In addition, RCCI is not as sensitive to the intake
pressure as the other strategies.

For the fully premixed HCCI combustion case, the intake pres-
sure sensitivity correction was again done, just as with the intake
temperature compensation, by simply varying the port fuel injec-
tion percentage with a fixed DI timing. The baseline combustion
phasing was recovered and NOx emissions remained well below the
target level. The results of intake pressure sensitivity for single fuel

global fuel reactivity (i.e., by using dual fuels) could be an enabler
for the control of premixed combustion concepts that yield high
thermal efficiency and near zero NOx and soot emissions, at least at
operating conditions considered in the referenced study.

ings of (cid:4)85, (cid:4)115 and (cid:4)143(cid:2) ATDC.

3.3. Fuel reactivity controlled RCCI combustion e HD engines

Hanson et al. [34] investigated the potential of controlling RCCI
combustion strategies by varying the fuel reactivity. The parame-
ters used in the study were steered from KIVA-CHEMKIN simula-
tions made with a reduced PRF mechanism, which included
injection timing, PFI fuel percentage and intake valve closing (IVC)
timings. The engine experiments were conducted on the engine
shown in Fig. 1 with a conventional common rail injector, and the
results demonstrated control and versatility of dual-fuel RCCI
combustion with proper fuel blends, SOI and IVC timings. The
objective of the study was to explore fuel blending as a means for
extending the RCCI operating regime.

To lower peak cylinder pressures and to aid in combustion
phasing control, different methods of modifying IVC timings were
implemented by Nevin et al. [43], who used four different custom
manufactured camshafts with IVC timings ranging from (cid:4)143(cid:2)
aTDC (stock) to (cid:4)85(cid:2) aTDC in order to lower the effective
compression ratio. The intake valve lift profiles are shown in Fig. 20.
Initial CFD modeling results suggested that the IVC timing of (cid:4)85(cid:2)

3.3.1. Effect of first and second main injection timings (SOI-1 and
SOI-2)

The first engine experiments were conducted at 9 bar IMEP and
1300 rev/min with injection timing (SOI-1) sweeps from (cid:4)55 to
(cid:4)62(cid:2) aTDC. In this case 73% (by mass of total fuel) gasoline was
injected in the intake port and the remaining 27% of diesel fuel was
injected into the cylinder. The diesel fuel was injected in two in-
jections with 62% of the diesel fuel quantity in the first injection.
The diesel injection durations for first and second pulses were
5.47(cid:2)CA and 3.12(cid:2)CA, respectively. The second injection timing, was
varied from (cid:4)29 to (cid:4)48(cid:2) aTDC, and the first injection quantity and
durations were the same as used in the first case.

As the SOI-1 timing was advanced, it was noticed that com-
bustion phasing was retarded, NOx and peak pressure rise rates
were reduced, and an increase in CO was observed. It is very
interesting to note that HC emissions remained relatively flat. The
reason for the reduced HC was thought to be due to less spray
impingement on the liner with an advance in SOI-1 timing, and this
was analysed in detail in the study of Kokjohn et al. [8]. From
Figs. 21 and 22 [34], it is noticed that, as SOI-1 timing was advanced,

the peak pressure decreases and the combustion phasing is
retarded. This results in reduced in-cylinder temperatures, whereas
in the case of SOI-2 timings, when the injection timing was
retarded, the combustion phasing advanced and peak pressure
increased. Due to the advanced combustion phasing and increased
peak pressure, the cylinder temperature is high. This increased
cylinder temperature is mainly due to the retarded injection timing,
since when the time available for mixing is less, fuel rich regions
result, which causes increased NOx and PM emissions. But HC and
CO remained unchanged with variation in SOI-2 timings. Fuel
consumption (i.e., net ISFC) was also constant due to the similar
combustion phasing and combustion efficiency.

The low ISFC of ~170 g/kWh seen in the experiments correlates
to a net thermal efficiency of 50%. As SOI-2 was advanced, the
pressure rise rates increased due to less mixture stratification,
resulting in a more homogeneous charge, which then delayed
ignition. Although some differences in the simulated and measured
results exist (e.g., HC is over predicted and soot is under predicted,
as was explained in the SOI-1 sweep) the agreement in NOx and
combustion phasing provided confidence that
the models
adequately described the physical processes.

3.3.2. Effect of SOI-1 fuel quantity

After investigating the effects of SOI-1, SOI-2 and IVC timings,
the next parameter investigated by Hanson et al. [34] was the fuel

quantity split between the two diesel injections. The percentage of
fuel in the first injection was varied, but the overall gasoline/diesel
fuel split was kept constant. The fraction of diesel fuel in SOI-1 was
varied from 36% to 62% (by mass) of the total fuel injected. From the
results of the SOI-1 fuel quantity sweep it was found that CO and HC
were relatively unaffected by the first injection fuel quantity.
However, NOx and PM increased significantly with the additional
second fuel injection. Similar to the results of the SOI-1 and SOI-2
timing tests, when more diesel fuel was injected later in the cy-
cle, a more stratified mixture was provided, which increased the
fuel reactivity. These richer and more reactive regions are likely to
ignite earlier, increasing cylinder temperatures, and thus cause NOx
and PM to increase. Fig. 23 shows the measured and simulated
pressure traces and heat release rates for SOI-1 fuel fractions of 36,
50 and 62%. As can be seen, a lower percentage of fuel in the first
injection advances the High Temperature Heat Release (HTHR) and
even gave a distinct two stage HTHR. With additional fuel injected
in SOI-1, the two stage HTHR is reduced and combustion phasing is
retarded.

3.3.3. Effect of IVC timings (effective compression ratio)

Hanson et al. [34] also investigated the effect of IVC timing on
dual fuel operation. First, dual fuel operation was investigated at
the three IVC timings, (cid:4)143(cid:2), (cid:4)115(cid:2) and (cid:4)85(cid:2) aTDC, while the
combustion phasing was held fixed by varying the gasoline

pressure of the (cid:4)85(cid:2) cam and to deliver the same trapped air mass
of 5 g/cycle.

Fig. 24(a) shows the measured cylinder pressure and heat
release results for a constant combustion phasing using three
different IVC timings and the resulting gasoline percentages. For
the different IVC timings, CA50 was kept constant by varying the
gasoline percentage. The increased TDC temperatures from the
earlier IVC timings of (cid:4)143 and (cid:4)115(cid:2) aTDC demanded higher
amounts of gasoline to maintain the combustion phasing over
the (cid:4)85(cid:2) aTDC IVC timing case. Also interesting to note, is the
difference in the shape of the heat release, as shown in the
expanded plot of Fig. 24(b). As the amount of gasoline injection
was increased, the magnitudes of the high temperature heat
release (HTHR) increases accordingly. Consequently, less diesel
fuel was injected for the earlier IVC timings. This decreased
amount of diesel fuel then released less energy, which reduced
the low temperature heat release (LTHR), as seen at ~ (cid:4)12(cid:2)
aTDC. As is well known, gasoline typically does not exhibit an
LTHR.

percentage. Further optimization of the global fuel reactivity was
performed at an IVC timing of (cid:4)143(cid:2) aTDC through a gasoline
percentage sweep. For each study the IVC pressure was adjusted
with the (cid:4)143(cid:2) and (cid:4)115(cid:2) cams to match the peak motored

Fig. 24(c) shows measured cylinder pressure and heat release
data for gasoline percentages of 82, 86 and 89% at a constant IVC
timing of (cid:4)143(cid:2) aTDC, which corresponds to the highest effective
compression ratio case of 16:1. The additional gasoline percentage
is seen to phase combustion later in the cycle by reducing the global
fuel reactivity. This later phasing of combustion drops cylinder
temperatures, which slows NOx formation rates and lowers heat
transfer [44]. HC and CO were seen to increase slightly due to the
slower oxidation rates at these cooler temperatures.

Pressure rise rates were also decreased with the additional
gasoline as the heat release rate reduced due to the increased
combustion duration. The later combustion phasing also helped to
decrease fuel consumption due to the lower rates of heat transfer
from reduced injection-generated turbulence and reduced soot
radiation. The combination of optimal combustion phasing, com-
bustion duration and lower heat transfer achieved a net indicated
thermal efficiency of 53% for the 89% gasoline and 11% diesel fuel
case, while meeting US EPA 2010 on-highway NOx and PM emis-
sions in cylinder. It is noteworthy that the study used an inexpen-
sive automotive-style port
injector and a low pressure
(800 bar) large hole nozzle diesel injector, which is a very cost
effective fuel injection system compared to current 2000 bar or
higher common-rail-systems.

fuel

Ma et al. [45] also investigated the effects of diesel injection
strategies on gasoline/diesel dual fuel combustion mode. They used
single and double injection strategies (similar to the ERC experi-
to achieve the required charge distribution. The
ments)

experimental results confirmed that this type of combustion mode
yields high efficiency with near zero NOx and soot emissions at
early injection timings and high gasoline ratios in the case of a
single injection strategy. Operating parameters such as injection
timing, diesel mass split between two injections and gasoline ratio
were also optimized for a double injection strategy. Based on the
optimized results, it was found that late second injection timing is
an effective approach to expand the operational range to higher
loads. However, the maximum load was limited by higher soot
emissions. Ma et al. [45] expanded the operating range to a
maximum IMEP of 13.9 bar by using a late second injection strategy
with increased fuel mass, while still maintaining good emissions
and MPRR within a given criteria (Fig. 25).

3.3.4. Mixing and auto-ignition processes in RCCI combustion

Understanding the mixing and auto-ignition process of RCCI
combustion is very important in order to obtain the required fuel
reactivity distribution in the cylinder. In this connection, recently,
Benajes et al. [46] reported an experimental and numerical study to
understand mixing and auto-ignition processes in RCCI combustion
using diesel and gasoline as the high and low reactivity fuels,
respectively. In their work a single-cylinder four stroke, compres-
sion ignition research engine representative of a commercial truck
engine was used for studying RCCI combustion. The data obtained
from the test engine were used as the input to an in-house 1-D
spray model, DICOM [47e49]. The code was focused on clarifying
the mixing process with respect to variations of the in-cylinder fuel

blending ratio and injection timing. The numerical study revealed
that combustion starts with the auto-ignition of the diesel fuel,
followed by entrainment of gasoline. The subsequent increase in
temperature and pressure was thought to initiate flame propaga-
tion across the lean diesel and gasoline regions of the combustion
chamber. The energy release rate pattern obtained from the test

engine showed that the combustion behavior was changed when
the diesel fuel was injected into a gasoline-air environment.

Once the effect of adding gasoline port injection to neat diesel
combustion was understood, the study focused on varying the in-
cylinder fuel blending ratio to understand the influence of global
fuel reactivity on the combustion and engine-out emissions for
staged RCCI combustion. The diesel fraction was reduced to 10% of
the fuel mass and the fraction of gasoline was increased, while
keeping the total amount of fuel supplied constant. The tests were
conducted at a constant speed of 1200 rev/min with fixed diesel SOI
of (cid:4)24 CAD aTDC and EGR rate of 45%. An important change was
noticed when the D/G ratio was reduced from 50/50% to 25/75%.
The ignition delay increased, extending the mixing time and the
first stage of combustion was lowered while the second was
enhanced. Further tests with varying injection timing revealed that
the advanced diesel SOI further increased the second stage com-
bustion process.

3.4. RCCI combustion using fuel additives (single fuel strategy)

Splitter et al. [50] demonstrated a “single fuel” strategy (PFI
fuelegasoline, DI fuel e Gasoline doped with a small quantity of di-
tertiary butyl peroxide (DTBP)) at a mid load condition on the HD
diesel engine shown in Fig. 1. They found that a very small per-
centage of an appropriate additive could be used to establish a
sufficient large reactivity gradient to match the performance of a

dual fuel strategy when operated in the RCCI regime. They used
DTBP as a cetane improver for the pump gasoline. The study
focused on investigating the feasibility of using a single fuel as both
the high and low reactivity fuels. The strategy involved PFI of gas-
oline and DI of gasoline doped with 0.75%, 1.75% and 3.5% DTBP by
volume, which accounts approximately 0.2% of the total fueling.
DTBP was selected based on research by Tanaka et al. [51]. In that

research, rapid compression machine experiments demonstrated
that for gasoline-like fuels, 2% DTBP addition provided a greater
effect in decreasing ignition delay than 2% addition of 2-EHN.

The single fuel results with DTBP were compared to previous
high-thermal efficiency, low-emissions results with port injection
of gasoline and direct injections of diesel. The comparison between
the fueling strategies found that the higher volatility of gasoline
enabled a reduction in the direct injection pressure from 800 (bar)
with diesel to 400 (bar) with gasoline. At the tested conditions, the
peak gross indicated based thermal efficiency was over 57%. The
emissions trends and magnitudes of the single fuel strategy were
also comparable to those of the diesel/gasoline dual-fuel strategy,
and both engine-out NOx and PM met EPA HD 2010 emissions [52]
mandates without aftertreatment. Also, the decreased low tem-
perature heat release with the single fuel strategy was found to
lower compression work and increased the thermal efficiency by
approximately 1% over the diesel/gasoline case.

In these experiments at 6 bar IMEP load and at 1300 rev/min
operation, the intake temperature, PFI percentage, port injection
pressure, port injection timing, direct injection pressure, direct
injection timings were maintained as 40 (cid:2)C, 90%, 4.14 bar, (cid:4)320 (cid:2)CA

aTDC, 400 bar, (cid:4)55 and (cid:4)36 (cid:2)CA aTDC, respectively. From Fig. 26(a)
it is noticed that the combustion is phased later in the cycle as the
percentage of DTBP is decreased, and as the DTBP percentage de-
creases, the reactivity gradient of the in-cylinder blended fuel is
decreased. This results in a globally and locally higher octane
mixture, which resists combustion more than more reactive

mixtures. The combustion timing and patterns of the DTBP sweep
in Fig. 26(a) were consistent with those of Eng et al. [53] who
considered HCCI with cetane improvers.

Splitter et al. [50] also compared 9 bar IMEP doped single fuel
strategy operation with 9 bar IMEP gasoline/diesel dual fuel work
by Hanson et al. [54]. The operating conditions for this test were

maintained as those of Hanson et al. [54]. It is clear from Fig. 26(b)
that 9 bar IMEP operation was possible with the single fuel strategy
using DTBP dosing. Furthermore, when operated with identical
conditions to those of the gasoline/diesel dual fuel strategy, the
single fuel strategy exhibited similar high temperature combustion
behavior and phasing. At the 9 bar IMEP condition, the PFI fraction
was varied using 89% 91% and 92% for each dosing percentage and
RCCI performance, emissions and combustion were analyzed.

In summary, the experiments performed by Splitter et al. [50]
demonstrated that relatively small amounts of cetane improver
could successfully be used to increase the fuel reactivity of the DI
fuel fraction, thus enabling use of a single low reactivity fuel stock
supplemented with a small quantity of additive.

3.5. Comparison of single and dual fuel strategies

Hanson et al. [55] conducted additional RCCI experiments on the
heavy-duty 2.44 L Caterpillar 3401 of Fig. 1. The primary objective of
the investigation was to study low load RCCI operation. The fueling
strategy selected for low load RCCI operation included both dual-
fuel and single fueling strategies. In-cylinder fuel blending for
RCCI operation was achieved using port fuel injection (PFI) of gas-
oline and early cycle, DI of diesel fuel in the case of the dual-fuel
injection strategy, and PFI of gasoline and DI of gasoline doped
with 3.5% by volume of the cetane improver 2-ethylhexyl nitrate
(2-EHN) in the case of the single fuel injection strategy. The se-
lection of 2-EHN as the cetane improver was made based on the
studies of Thomson et al. [56], and rapid compression machine
(RCM) experiments with and without CN improved PRF90 (primary
reference fuel) [57] and other studies [58e60].

Hanson et al. [55] investigated RCCI operation at loads 2 and
4.5 bar gIMEP at engine speeds between 800 and 1700 rev/min.
This load range was selected to cover the low load operational

range. At these loads, the engine operating conditions such as inlet
air temperature, port fuel amount and the engine speed were
varied to investigate their effects on combustion. The DI injection
strategy utilized one early injection to raise the reactivity of the fuel
in the squish region near the cylinder liner, and a second injection
closer to top dead center (TDC) to increase the reactivity in the
center regions of the cylinder. The injection timings were fixed for
all cases, with the squish conditioning pulse at (cid:4)62(cid:2) aTDC and the
ignition pulse at (cid:4)37(cid:2) aTDC. Fig. 1 shows the experimental set up
and Fig. 6 explains the injection timings, while Fig. 27 elucidates the
injection strategies.

3.5.1. Dual fuel e gasoline/diesel light load operation

Hanson et al. [55] conducted the initial experiments at 4.5 bar
IMEP with gasoline as the low reactivity fuel and diesel as the high
reactivity fuel and investigated the effect of engine speed on
combustion phasing, the ratio of the high reactivity to the low
reactivity fuel (PFI fraction), thermal efficiency, as well as losses due
to heat transfer, incomplete combustion, pumping, exhaust and
emissions. Experiments with different PFI fractions at 1300 and
1700 rev/min showed that the AHRR and cylinder pressure
decreased with increases in engine speed. Also, it was observed
that the low temperature reaction (LTR) profiles for these speeds
were similar, and the same characteristics were seen even at
800 rev/min. While the LTR profiles were similar at these speeds, it
was observed that the high temperature reaction (HTR) became
significantly shorter when engine speed was reduced from 1700 to
800 rev/min. Also, it was noticed that variation in the ratio of high
reactivity to low reactivity fuel was required to maintain the
desired combustion phasing (5 (cid:2)CA aTDC). Another significant
observation from the experiments was an evident decrease in
thermal efficiency at higher engine speeds due to increased

combustion and pumping losses. The increased combustion losses
were due to the fact that increased engine speed lowered the
equivalence ratio (due to decreased volumetric efficiency), and the
decreased equivalence ratio caused a larger decrease in combustion
efficiency at higher speeds. However, NOx and soot emissions were
within the EPA limits (0.27 g/kWh and 0.013 g/kWh, respectively)
at all speeds. The gross thermal efficiencies were near 50% for most

cases. The combustion phasing was well controlled and thus the
results demonstrated successful light load gasoline/diesel RCCI
operation. Figs. 28 and 29 show the results obtained at 4.5 bar IMEP
at various speeds.

3.5.2. Comparison of injection strategies

Hanson et al. [55] also compared “single fuel” strategy results
with the dual-fuel strategy results.
In that study, the cetane
improver 2-EHN was used at a doping percentage of 3.5% by vol-
ume with the gasoline in the DI fuel stream, and un-doped gasoline
in the port fuel stream (flow rate of 2-EHN was 0.4% of the total
fueling rate). Identical experiments were performed with the single
fuel strategy. Similar to the dual-fuel tests, the combustion phasing
was found to be easily controlled by adjusting the ratio of the high
reactivity to the low reactivity fuel. In this case, the HTR was faster
than the dual-fuel strategy, and significant differences were noticed
in the LTR too, due to the addition of 2-EHN with gasoline in DI
stream. Since gasoline typically does not exhibit a two stage heat
release, the LTR reactions occurred from the decomposition of the
2-EHN in the DI fuel stream (Tables 15e17).

Similar findings were also observed by Eng et al. [53] in HCCI
experiments, and Splitter et al. [35] in RCCI experiments, where
both studies concluded that the earlier and more gentle LTR of
cetane-improved gasoline was primarily responsible for radical
generation and heat generation. In the engine speed sweep, the
single fuel strategy also showed similar trends in combustion and
HTR duration at constant combustion phasing to that of the dual-
fuel results. In the cylinder pressure history shown in Fig. 30 it is
observed that the compression pressure was increased with in-
crease in engine speed, even though the engine load and com-
bustion timings were fixed for both strategies, which resulted from
the change in equivalence ratio with engine speed.

The single-fuel strategy showed similar HC, CO and NOx trade-
offs as the dual-fuel tests. With both strategies, it was observed
that as combustion was retarded, HC and CO increased, while NOx
decreased. It is interesting to note that although 2-EHN is an N-

containing compound, the measured engine-out NOx emissions
were still very low, with CA50 timings after 1(cid:2) ATDC passing EPA
2010 mandates in-cylinder. Furthermore, PM emissions were very
low for all cases, with all tested speeds and CA50 timings passing
the EPA 2010 mandates in-cylinder. The thermal efficiency and
indicated specific fuel consumption (ISFC) trend with combustion
phasing showed higher efficiency at high speeds due to lower heat
transfer to the cylinder walls. However, as expected the higher
engine speed had higher pumping and heat losses to the exhaust,
but these additional losses were less than the efficiency gains from
the decreased heat transfer. Although 2010 US EPA HD PM and NOx

3.5.3.

Intake temperature effects

Fig. 31 shows that a wide range of

intake temperatures
(40e70 (cid:2)C) could be used with similar combustion phasings for
both strategies. As the intake temperature was increased, the
combustion tended to have a shorter duration, which was thought
to be caused by the required higher ratio of PFI fuel (used to
maintain constant combustion phasing), which tends to ignite
more volumetrically. This can also be seen in Fig. 31, where com-
bustion duration differences over the entire intake temperature
sweep are seen for both fuel injection strategies. Specifically, the
HTR event is more rapid with 2-EHN, displaying a slow ramp fol-
lowed by a rapid HTR. The emissions and performance results of the
intake temperature sweep for both the dual-fuel and single-fuel
results can be seen in Tables 18 and 19. The HC and CO emissions
from the single fuel case were lower than those of the dual-fuel
case, resulting in increased thermal efficiencies across all intake
temperatures. Here, the energy losses from heat transfer, pumping
and exhaust were similar between the fueling strategies. Since the
losses were similar, all of the thermal efficiency gains were due to
improved combustion efficiency alone. The decreased combustion
duration and increased port-fuel-fraction seen in the speed sweep
was also seen in the temperature sweep. PM emissions between the
two fuel injection strategies were also similar. The slight increase in
PM was thought to be caused by increased PM formation rates from
the increased intake temperatures and the results are summarized
in Tables 18 and 19.

3.5.4. RCCI operation at idle

Additional tests were conducted at a very light load of 2 bar
gross IMEP [55]. Here it can be seen that at both engine speeds the
combustion phasing was easily adjustable, with low pressure rise
rates and a low ringing intensity (pressure rise rate) of between 0.5
and 1 (MW/m2). The ringing intensity (RI) was obtained using the
Eng et al. [53] correlation,

Similar to the results at 4.5 bar gross IMEP, the combustion
duration and PFI fuel fraction were seen to increase with engine
speed and retarded combustion phasing. HC, CO and NOx also fol-
lowed a similar trade-off to that seen at 4.5 bar IMEP, with HC and
CO increasing as combustion is retarded and NOx tending to
decrease with later phasing. The soot concentration was also
weakly affected by phasing, but is still very low, even with a large

percentage of DI fuel. The differences in thermal efficiency between
1300 and 800 rev/min are likely due to the increased time for heat
transfer from the slower engine speed.

Thus, RCCI operation was demonstrated successfully experi-
mentally at loads as low as 2 bar gross IMEP. By keeping the global
equivalence ratio above 0.3, HC and CO emissions were found to be
similar to those at the 4.5 bar IMEP condition. From the results it
was noticed that, for particular cases NOx and PM could be below
US 2010 EPA levels with thermal efficiencies of 44%.

3.6. RCCI- A pathway to controlled high efficiency and clean
combustion

Kokjohn et al. [60] used the same HD engine shown in Fig. 1 and
the only modification made for their work was that two of the cam
shafts shown in Fig. 20 were used. As discussed above, the stock
cam shaft of the HD test engine had an IVC timing of (cid:4)143(cid:2) aTDC
and the modified camshaft with an IVC timing of (cid:4)85(cid:2) aTDC was
also used. However, both the cams had the same IVO timing of
(cid:4)335(cid:2) aTDC. Kokjohn et al. [60] demonstrated RCCI combustion
over a range of loads from 4.6 bar IMEP to 14.6 bar IMEP.

Simulations were also performed using the computational grid
shown in Fig. 5. Notice that the region above the top piston ring was
resolved in this study; however, ring motion and flows past the
compression rings were not included. From the CFD modeling,
operation at 9 bar was selected for further analysis.

The injection strategy was same as shown in Fig. 3. The results
focused on high efficiency cases from a number of experiments.
Thus, the operating parameters and variables were not fixed over
the load sweep, and the port fuel fractions and EGR combinations
were selected based on chemical kinetic simulations of Kokjohn
et al. [8]. The gross indicated efficiency was found to be 49% at the
low load condition, and peaked at 56% at 9.3 bar IMEP, and then
leveled out near 52% for the higher loads. The optimization was

done at the 9.3 bar IMEP operating point. The operating conditions
for the dual-fuel RCCI load sweep from 4.6 to 14.6 bar IMEP are
given in Table 20.

Fig. 32 shows the measured and predicted cylinder pressures
and AHRR over the load sweep. The simulations were able to
accurately capture the combustion characteristics over the range of
loads. Comparing the predicted and measured values in Fig. 32, it
can be seen that the models do a reasonable job in capturing the
emissions and engine performance over the load sweep. However,
at the 4.6 bar IMEP condition NOx was over predicted by the model,
but for the remaining load sweep NOx was predicted reasonably
well (for these cases both the measured and predicted NOx levels
are very low; thus slight differences are not of significant concern).
Comparing the measured and predicted soot emissions, it can be
seen that the models did a reasonable job capturing the soot trends;
however, soot was significantly over-predicted at the 14.6 bar IMEP
operating point. It should be noted that the soot model constants
were held fixed over the load sweep (i.e., no attempts were made to
‘tune’ the soot model to each specific operating condition). Recall
that the 14.6 bar IMEP operation point is near stoichiometric and
some portions of the combustion chamber could be expected to
undergo slightly rich combustion. The over-prediction of soot as
rich combustion is encountered may suggest that different soot
model constants are required for rich and lean combustion. How-
ever, since the primary focus of the work was fuel consumption,
adjustments to the soot model parameters were not explored. More
importantly, it can be seen that both the trends and magnitudes of
the gross indicated efficiencies were closely captured by the
models. Furthermore, because PRR and combustion noise were
major limiting factors for premixed operation, it is important to
note that the simulations did an excellent job capturing both the
trends and magnitudes of the RI (Tables 21 and 22).

Fig. 32 and Table 23 also explain the location and formation of
UHCs over the load range from 4.6 bar to 14.6 bar IMEP. Considering
Fig. 10, the trend in combustion efficiency and gross indicated ef-
ficiency is clear. At the lightest loads, operation borders on the lean
limit for the premixed gasoline and complete oxidation of UHC and
CO are difficult. At higher engine loads, as stoichiometric operation

is approached, the DI event must be carefully controlled to avoid
rich regions and incomplete combustion due to insufficient oxygen.
It is likely that at the highest engine loads the UHC and CO emis-
sions could be reduced by increasing the boost pressure to elimi-
nate the regions undergoing rich combustion. However, this was
not been explored. Finally, the peak in gross indicated efficiency
and combustion efficiency at 9.3 bar IMEP is evident as the result of
operation that avoids both the lean and rich oxidation limits.

Although low temperature combustion of in-cylinder blends of
diesel e gasoline offers low NOx and soot emissions with improved
engine efficiency and extendable load range, however this type of
combustion can produce high unburned hydrocarbons (UHC) and
carbon monoxide emissions. De Ojeda et al. [61] studied the
chemical origins of the key hydrocarbon species detected in the
engine exhaust under diesel-gasoline operation and further
developed strategies to lower UHC emissions with low NOx, low

soot, and efficiency benefits. The tests were conducted on a single
cylinder research engine based on Navistar MAXFORCE 6L engine at
a constant load of 10 bar nIMEP with a fixed engine speed of
1600 rev/min. The engine exhaust was analyzed with an FTIR
analyzer for species investigation. In their investigation, HC species
were categorized as (1) Non-oxygenated species: C1eC3 hydrocar-
bons (methane, ethylene, acetylene, and propylene), C4eC7 alkanes
(butane, pentane and heptane), and mono-aromatics (toluene), and
(2) Oxygenated species: aldehydes (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde,
and benzaldehyde).

It was found that C1eC3 hydrocarbons were the dominant hy-
drocarbon species in the engine exhaust of diesel-only operation
with EGR, whereas in diesel-gasoline operation UHC appeared as
mono-aromatics and C4eC7 alkanes, which are mainly formed due
to the partially oxidized gasoline constituents. These results helped
to suggest suitable strategies for reducing hydrocarbon emissions

from dieselegasoline operation. The results revealed that an in-
crease in diesel fraction in dieselegasoline operation reduced UHC
emissions with an increase in soot emissions due to enhanced
overall fuel reactivity. The results also indicated that advanced

diesel SOI also significantly reduced the UHC emissions without
compromising the simultaneous low reduction in NOx and soot
emissions. Since one of the reasons for the higher UHC emissions in
dieselegasoline operation is due to the presence of partially
oxidized gasoline constituents, the advanced diesel SOI overcomes
this by enhancing the reactivity homogeneity of the in-cylinder
charge, which in turn minimizes low reactivity regions in the en-
gine, and there by the UHC emissions were significantly reduced.
The overall UHC reduction observed was 65% with an 8%
improvement in engine cycle efficiency (Figs. 33 and 34).

3.6.1. Dual direct injection RCCI combustion to control UHC and CO
emissions

Prior work on RCCI used port injection of the low reactivity
fuel and direct injection of the high reactivity fuel. In an effort to
decrease UHC and CO emissions while retaining the benefits of
RCCI, Wissink et al. [62] explored the direct, separate injections
of both the low and high reactivity fuels. With port fuel injection
the reactivity gradient in the cylinder is directly proportional to
the equivalence ratio gradient. By direct injecting both fuels
these gradients become decoupled and independent stratifica-
tion of reactivity and equivalence ratio becomes possible. By
direct injecting both fuels, a more controlled distribution is
possible through spray targeting, potentially reducing the

amount of unburned fuel in crevice regions. The experimental
results showed that direct injection of both fuels provides per-
formance at least as good as the standard port-fuel strategy, but
with significantly less NOx and similar HC and CO. The direct
injection of diesel through use of a low pressure the GDI injector
rather than the common rail system also resulted in significant
PM reduction. This clearly indicates that the injector hardware
requirements for RCCI may be substantially different from those
of CDC, and that further investigation into optimum diesel
injector design for RCCI will be worthwhile. Also, from compu-
tational studies it understood that piston-liner crevice flows are
the primary source of UHC and that proper spray targeting can
reduce UHC and CO [60].

Due to the scale of the variable space, further optimization of
this strategy will require a continued collaboration between
experimental and computational studies.
Important variables
include the nozzle included angle, the quantity, timing and number
of the gasoline and diesel injections, the ratio of gasoline to diesel,
the temperature and pressure boundary conditions and EGR levels.
The modeling study of Lim and Reitz [63] investigated these
parameters with use of dual direct injectors for combustion phasing
control of high load RCCI combustion. This work demonstrated that
21 bar gross IMEP RCCI was achievable using dual direct injections.
The study used an NSGA II algorithm for finding optimum injection
strategies. The goal of the optimization was to find injection tim-
ings and mass splits among the multiple injections that simulta-
neously minimized six objectives, including such as soot, NOx, CO,
UHC, ISFC and RI. The simulations were performed for a 2.44L, HD
engine with 15:1 compression ratio at a speed of 1800 rev/min. Two
iso-octane injections were used with one targeting the squish re-
gion and the other targeting the bowl. The single n-heptane in-
jection was the ignition source for the entire charge. The results
indicated that the n-heptane injection mass and timing was most
effective for combustion control. The optimum injection strategy
resulted in a reasonable 158 bar maximum in-cylinder pressure,
12.6 bar/deg peak pressure rise rate, and 48.7% gross thermal

The study concluded that understanding the effect of increased
squish land length on the combustion control is of future interest
due to the increased heat transfer in that region local surface to
volume ratio.

3.6.2. Comparison of conventional diesel and RCCI combustion

Direct comparisons were made by Kokjohn et al. [60] between
conventional diesel operation and RCCI operation at the 9 bar IMEP
operating point (see Fig. 35). The conventional diesel case was
taken from Ref. [64]. There were small differences in the operating
conditions (see Table 24) between the RCCI and conventional
diesel. The speed differed by less than 100 rev/min, and it was
thought that these would not influence the findings of the RCCI

demonstrated three orders of magnitude lower NOx, a factor of six
lower soot levels, and 16.4% higher gross indicated efficiency.
However, RCCI showed increased PRR, RI and combustion losses.

rapid. This is due to the elimination of cool regions near the cyl-
inder liner where reaction rates are relatively low and combustion
struggles to reach completion.

From the combined effort of the experiments and CFD modeling,
it was understood that the observed NOx and soot reductions are
due to the avoidance of high equivalence ratio and high tempera-
ture regions in the combustion chamber, as shown in Fig. 36(a).
Two factors were found to explain the improved thermal efficiency.
First, RCCI combustion avoids the high temperature regions that are
located near the piston bowl surface, as observed in the compari-
sons with the conventional diesel combustion case shown in
Fig. 36(d). Thus, the HT losses are reduced by nearly a factor of two.
Second, RCCI combustion shows improved control over the start-
and end-of-combustion. This improved combustion control al-
lows the combustion timing and duration to be optimized for
minimum compression work and maximum expansion work (i.e.,
maximum indicated efficiency). The improved control over the
start- and end-of-combustion was highlighted by exploring adia-
batic operation with the CFD modeling. It was found that when
consideration of HT is removed, the RCCI combustion process
converted 14% more of the recovered HT energy into useful work
than conventional diesel operation (Table 25).

3.7. RCCI operation toward 60% thermal efficiency

Splitter et al. [66] explored methods to obtain the maximum
practical cycle efficiency with RCCI. The study used both zero-
dimensional computational cycle simulations and engine experi-
ments. The experiments were conducted using the single-cylinder
heavy-duty research diesel engine shown in Fig. 1 adapted for dual
fuel operation, with and without piston oil gallery cooling. In pre-
vious studies, RCCI combustion with in-cylinder fuel blending using
port-fuel-injection of a low reactivity fuel and optimized direct-
injections of higher reactivity fuels was demonstrated to permit
near-zero levels of NOx and PM emissions in-cylinder, while
simultaneously realizing gross indicated thermal efficiencies in
excess of 56%. The present study considered RCCI operation at a
fixed load condition of 6.5 bar IMEP at an engine speed of 1300 rev/

But the ringing intensity was still within the limit (5 MW/m2)
suggested by Dec and Yang [13].

Fig. 35 shows comparisons of cylinder pressure and AHRR for
cases with and without heat transfer (HT) included in the simula-
tions. In the adiabatic cases, the IVC temperatures were adjusted
slightly to provide the same combustion phasing as the cases
considering HT. For the RCCI case, in the model the IVC temperature
was reduced by 7 K and for the conventional diesel case the initial
temperature was reduced by 5 K. Notice that, since the HT is
eliminated, the peak AHRR for the RCCI case increases significantly.
However, since the rate of heat release for conventional diesel
combustion is controlled by transport (i.e., the transport of reactive
material to the reaction zone) the combustion rate for the con-
ventional diesel case is relatively insensitive to the elimination of
HT. However, the RCCI case shows that, aside from an increase in
the peak heat release rate, the end of combustion is much more

temperatures, reducing the driving potential for heat transfer, and
increasing the expansion g, both increasing work potential. How-
ever, to capitalize on these advantages the combustion event must
be knock-free, as it is well known that combustion knock increases
engine heat transfer. For example, Grandin et al. [68] using in-
cylinder Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy (CARS) laser
diagnostics coupled with in-cylinder thermocouples demonstrated
that during knocking conditions the thermal boundary layer thins,
and heat losses increase.

compression ratio and its properties and profile are shown in
Table 26 and Fig. 37, respectively.

The results demonstrated that the indicated gross thermal ef-
ficiency could be increased by not cooling the piston, by using high
dilution, and by optimizing in-cylinder fuel stratification with the
two fuel technique using large reactivity differences. The best re-
sults achieved gross thermal efficiencies (GTE) near 60%. By further
analyzing the results with zero-dimensional engine cycle simula-
tions, the limits of cycle efficiency were investigated. The simula-
tions demonstrated that RCCI operation without piston oil cooling
rejected less heat, and that ~94% of the maximum cycle efficiency
could be achieved while simultaneously obtaining ultra-low NOx
and PM emissions.

HCCI relies on the autoignition of a fully premixed air-fuel
charge, affording operation with very lean mixtures (F < 0.3). As
noted by Foster [67], the lean charge reduces combustion gas

show that partial fuel stratification can increase engine efficiency
at high loads by reducing engine knocking and enabling more
efficient combustion phasing. Alternatively, fuel stratification can
be compounded by introducing simultaneous reactivity and F
stratification through the use of dual-fueling. Modeling results by
Kokjohn and Reitz [75] have shown that F plus reactivity strati-
fication further enhances the ignition gradient within the charge,
enabling knock-free autoignition combustion phasings near TDC at
mid-high load operation. In-cylinder planar laser induced flores-
cence (PLIF) measurements by Kokjohn et al. [76] supported
earlier emissions spectroscopy work by Splitter et al. [77], which
demonstrated that this dual-fuel combustion event is controlled
by zones of reactivity sequentially igniting from the most to least
reactive.

In Splitter et al. [66] the fuels used were splash blended on site.
The low reactivity fuel used was E85, determined through blending
a measured volume of 85% ethanol with a separate measured vol-
ume of 15% gasoline, and the blend comprised the port injected
fuel. The high reactivity fuel was cetane improved gasoline. 3% by
volume of 2-Ethylhexyl-Nitrate (EHN) was added to gasoline, and

(1 (cid:4) EGR)) operation. However, without piston oil cooling (red
markers) the tradeoff in these losses is reduced, enabling good
combustion efficiency at leaner operation, thus compounding in-
creases efficiency. The results of Fig. 40 clearly demonstrate that
without piston oil gallery cooling, RCCI can exhibit an improved
maximum efficiency of approximately 1% point higher. The reasons
for this are surprisingly not from improved combustion efficiency,
as there is actually a 0.5% point decrease without cooling, but are
from reduced heat transfer and exhaust losses of over 1% point.
Also, it is clearly demonstrated that without piston oil gallery
cooling GTE can be increased, however it was not demonstrated if
the increases were from leaner operation, or the change in piston
cooling. Therefore, to explore these relations, further analysis was
performed. Fig. 41 displays the F0 associated with maximum effi-
ciency for the four conditions presented in Table 27.

The results illustrated that without piston oil cooling efficiency
was maximized at leaner conditions. Therefore, the reductions in
heat transfer in Fig. 40 are likely partially dependent on reduced in-
cylinder temperatures associated with leaner operation. Thus, to
better isolate the trapped mass effects on losses, matched F0
operation was compared. The results are presented in Fig. 41.
However, as seen in Fig. 42, without piston oil gallery cooling the
volumetric efficiency of the engine was reduced. This has an indi-
rect impact on gross efficiency. With piston oil gallery cooling, the
highest GTE coincides with high volumetric efficiency and low heat
transfer (HX). That is, improved engine breathing and thus trapped
mass improve GTE.

Conversely, without piston oil gallery cooling, the highest GTE
values coincided with the lowest HX and intermediate volumetric
efficiency. This suggests that decreased engine breathing may
enable improved GTE and reduced HX. However, the relations be-
tween breathing and net efficiency were strongly linked, and thus
careful and well-engineered air handling systems are required.
Additionally, the effect of reduced volumetric efficiency was found
to be strongly linked to piston cooling and not to differences in the
fueling (PFI/DI ratio), suggesting that piston cooling is primarily
responsible for the reduced volumetric efficiency. To understand
the reasons for this volumetric efficiency and HX trend reversal,
select cooled and uncooled cases were compared. Fig. 42 also

losses and increase in GTE were possible. The tested conditions can
be seen in Table 26 with all 102 data points graphically shown in
Fig. 38.

The results of Fig. 39 show that for low heat transfer and exhaust
losses, lean operation is required. This competes with incomplete
combustion losses, which were less at intermediate F0 (F0 1⁄4 F

3.8. RCCI operation with conventional and alternative fuels (mid
and high loads)

Splitter et al. [78] investigated the effect of fuel properties on
RCCI combustion by considering gasoline-diesel dual-fuel opera-
tion, ethanol (E85)-diesel dual fuel operation, and a “single fuel”
gasolineegasoline þ DTBP. Remarkably high gross indicated ther-
mal efficiencies were achieved, reaching 59%, 56%, and 57% for E85-
diesel, gasoline-diesel, and gasolineegasoline þ DTBP, respectively.
Splitter et al. performed the engine experiments using conditions
based on CFD simulations for the heavy duty engine shown in Fig. 1
and modeling was further used to explain the experimentally
observed trends. To examine the differences between the three
fueling strategies, the results of the E85-diesel and gasoline-
diesel dual-fuel
results were compared to the single fuel
gasolineegasoline þ DTBP results at 9.6 bar IMEPg load. Compared
to gasolineediesel, significantly higher quantities of diesel fuel
were required to maintain optimal combustion phasing with the
E85-diesel fuel blends. This is because of the combination of
lower
reactivity and higher enthalpy of vaporization of
ethanol (compared to gasoline) and combustion chemistry effects
of
fuel
gasolineegasoline þ DTBP yielded near identical emissions and
ISFC results to gasolineediesel operation. Although the emissions
and ISFC of all three strategies were similar, the LTHR were different
with all three fuels, and the HTHR was different with the E85-
diesel blends. Fuel chemistry effects for all three fuels were inves-
tigated and their effect on the reactivity gradient was found to be
responsible for the combustion differences, as discussed next.

3.8.1. Reactivity reduction and enhancement strategies

Splitter et al. [78] adopted ethanol as the fuel reactivity reducing
agent for several reasons. First, ethanol has a very high resistance to
auto-ignition [79]. Second, ethanol is commercially available in
blends with gasoline in ratios as high as 85% by volume. Third,
research by Hashimoto [80] has demonstrated that ethanol/n-
heptane mixtures exhibit significantly different low temperature
chemistry. To explore the effect of a greater reactivity gradient,
port-fuel-injection of E85 was used instead of gasoline port fuel
injection.

The RCCI experiments are summarized in Fig. 43. The only dif-
ference between gasoline-diesel, E85-diesel dual fuel operation
and single fuel operation is that the DI pressure was reduced from
800 bar to 400 bar. The reduction in injection pressure was done to
account for the volatility differences of gasoline and diesel fuel.
Because gasoline vaporizes much faster than diesel fuel, a lower
injection pressure was used to produce larger, less easily vaporized
droplets, as discussed by Shi et al. [81].

Srinivas et al. [82] investigated the effect of ethanol energy
injection timing on engine efficiency and
fraction and diesel
emissions. Their study was conducted on a single cylinder
common-rail diesel engine which was modified to adopt dual
fueling technology. In the investigation ethanol was introduced
into the intake manifold using a port fuel injector, while diesel was
injected directly into the cylinder. Srinivas et al. found that with
increased ethanol energy fraction at fixed diesel injection timing

illustrates the trends in bulk gas in-cylinder temperature at
matched conditions.

Based on the experimental results, 0-D GT-Power simulations
were used to help analyze the experimental findings and to
determine cycle efficiency limits. The simulations were conducted
using the experimental inputs for the initial conditions, and were
used to assess pathways for achieving 50% BTE or greater in an HD
engine. The simulations suggested that gross thermal efficiencies
upwards of 60% would be required, with simultaneous low
pumping and frictional losses. The results show that with opti-
mized combustion management and thermodynamic conditions,
60% gross engine efficiencies are possible with RCCI,
thus
providing a pathway to meet the DOE Super Truck 50% BTE engine
efficiency goal, as well as a pathway for reaching 55% BTE. How-
ever, the results have also shown that improvements to boosting
system efficiencies for low exhaust temperatures and overall re-
ductions in friction are required to best capitalize on the high
gross efficiencies.

the engine efficiency increased until the engine operation became
limited by misfire due to over-retarded combustion phasing. Also it
was noticed that energy share up to 60% of diesel by ethanol ach-
ieved a 10% efficiency gain compared to diesel-only operation. The
results indicated that the decreased burn duration was the primary
cause for the efficiency gain. The engine emissions shows that HC,
CO and NOx emissions were increased with increase in ethanol
fraction, which raises a question on the advantages of utilizing
ethanol in a diesel engine. Moreover, negligible smoke emissions
were measured at ethanol energy ratios of 20% or higher, sug-
gesting that optimization of these emissions would be much easier
compared with conventional diesel combustion.

3.8.2. Engine operating condition and charge preparation strategies

During the ethanolediesel engine tests of Splitter et al. [78] the
total fueling was progressively increased to increase engine load,
and the thermodynamic conditions and fuel reactivity were altered
to maintain operation under the operator-imposed cylinder pres-
sure and PPR limits. For all these tests and fuels the engine was
operated with the injection strategy described in Table 28.

3.8.3. Gasolineediesel (G/D) and E85-diesel (E85/D) strategies

Table 29 shows the tested loads, where at each operating con-
dition exhaust emissions were sampled, and indicated cylinder
pressure measurement were acquired. While changing load the
50% mass fraction burned combustion timing (CA 50) was allowed
to adjust as needed to retain the PRR below the imposed 10 bar/(cid:2)CA
and 150 bar peak cylinder pressure limits. Select indicated cylinder

pressure and apparent heat release rate (AHRR) traces of this load
sweep can be seen in Fig. 43.

It is important to note that for E85-diesel testing a similar port
fueling mass was used as with the previously demonstrated gaso-
lineediesel testing, but due to the reduced lower heating value of
ethanol, the distribution of energy between the port and direct
injection streams was not the same. Fig. 44 demonstrates the
relation between mass and energy between the two port fuels. The
E85-diesel operation was performed at engine loads between 9.6
and 16.5 bar IMEPg, and cylinder pressure and AHRR are shown in
Fig. 43.

The increase in port fuel percentage and EGR rate were such as
to phase combustion later and to allow low pressure rise rate
operation at high loads. Furthermore, the combustion duration of
E85-diesel displayed extended HRR compared to gasoline-diesel
operation.

3.8.4. Mid load G/D and E85/D comparisons

Fig. 45 compares E85-diesel to gasoline-diesel operation at the
lowest and highest comparable loads, where the extended com-
bustion duration of E85-diesel at both engine loads is more
apparent. Fig. 46 shows a comparison of the measured and simu-
lated cylinder pressure and apparent heat release rates for opera-
tion at the nominal 9 bar IMEPg and 1300 rev/min using both E85-
diesel and gasolineediesel fuel blends.

It can be seen that the simulations do an excellent job in
capturing the combustion characteristics for both blends. More
specifically, notice that the change in combustion characteristics
between gasolineediesel and E85-diesel is captured well by the
simulations. For instance, dual-fuel PCCI combustion using a blend
of E85 and diesel fuel shows a nearly “triangular shaped” HTHR
profile and a very broad combustion duration, quite different from
the more symmetric Gaussian-like gasolineediesel result. Also the
magnitude of the LTHR is significantly reduced in the E85-diesel

case, as compared to the gasoline-diesel case. This is somewhat
counterintuitive considering that the LTHR is dominated by the
diesel fuel, and the mass fraction of diesel fuel with E85-diesel
operation is nearly twice that with gasolineediesel operation
(11% vs. 21%). These results differ from those by both [34] and [25],
where increased reactive fuel fraction corresponded to an increase
in LTHR magnitude.

To understand the noted differences in the LTHR and HTHR
combustion characteristics between E85-diesel fuel blends and
gasolineediesel fuel blends, CFD simulations were used. Fig. 46
shows the CFD-predicted evolutions of several key species for
both fueling strategies. It can be seen that, in general, the com-
bustion processes between gasolineediesel fuel and E85-diesel fuel
blends are very similar. Reactivity enhancement results were also
discussed in Section 3.2.2 [50].

3.8.5. Combustion and emission comparisons

Quantitative comparisons of combustion and emissions trends
for each fueling strategy are plotted as a function of load in Fig. 47.
Although there are many similarities in the combustion trends
between the fuels, there are differences, specifically in the HTHR
combustion duration, which with E85-diesel operation is approx-
imately 50% longer. As previously discussed, when operating with
E85-diesel both the LTHR and HTHR events were quite different,
and the lengthened HTHR is thought to occur from the greater RON
stratification and the ethanol inhibitor effect. Since the combustion

Fig. 62. Effect of swirl on efficiency [90].

phasing of all fuels is similar for a given load, fuel chemistry effects
should be better isolated between the fuels. However, there is a
benefit in thermal efficiency and thus gasoline equivalent ISFC
when operating with E85-diesel. This is primarily thought to be an
effect of both the fast transition from the LTHR to HTHR and the
improved expansion gamma caused by the EGR-free or reduced
EGR requirements of E85-diesel as compared to the other fuels.

Furthermore, with all the tested fuels the indicated specific fuel
consumption trends demonstrated a local minimum, of approxi-
mately 150 g/kWh (gross), at the 6e12 bar IMEPg operating con-
ditions. The low fuel consumption at these loads is believed to be
due to the more extensive optimization that was performed at
these loads. Further optimization of the higher load operation
points could possibly yield further fuel consumption gains, for
instance by lowering the CO emissions at the high equivalence
ratios through leaner operation (Fig. 47a and b demonstrates stoi-
chiometric operation at the higher loads). Another operating con-
dition that was not optimized for performance was the lowest load
operating condition of 5.2 bar IMEPg.

(CR) of 16 to a lower compression ratio of 14. It was found that
compared to a compression ratio of 16, a compression ratio of 14
required lower G/D ratio and provided improved fuel consumption.
At the CR of 14 suitable air system targets were identified first
through simulations and subsequently further optimization of
fueling strategies was performed. The air system targets were
identified based on NOx and soot targets. Additional simulations
were performed at EGR rates of 40%, 45% and 50% with single and
double injection strategies. The required EGR rate was optimized by
observing NOx and MPRR targets. In both injection strategies EGR
rates of 45 and 50% met the NOx and MPRR targets, but a 50% EGR
rate is an aggressive target for a practical air system to deliver in HD
engines. Therefore, an EGR rate of 45% was identified as a reason-
able air-system target. The subsequent simulation results indicated
that at a CR of 14 the fuel consumption was improved by 11e13%
over baseline diesel combustion for both single and double in-
jections and 85% PFI was appeared to be optimal at the speed of
1531 rev/min. The study also demonstrated that the computational
tools can be successfully used to develop viable dual fuel strategies
for HD engine applications.

In continuation of the work, Zhang et al. [84] at the Argonne
National Laboratory performed a low temperature combustion
experimental study of in-cylinder blending of fuels on a Navistar
MaxxForce 13 heavy e duty compression ignition engine. The
modified heavy-duty engine had a geometric compression ratio of
14 and used sequential, multi-port-injection of low reactivity fuels
(Gasoline and E85) with in-cylinder direct injection of diesel. The
tests were conducted at 1200 rev/min and varying loads from
5.5 bar BMEP to 19 bar BMEP. The engine operation was optimized
within the constraints of NOx < 0.2 g/bhp-h and pressure rise rate
<15 bar/deg, (similar to the constraints used by the ERC group for
optimizing RCCI operation) by adjusting the diesel injection strat-
egy, fraction of port fuel supplied, and air intake conditions
(Table 30). The tests were conducted in two modes, namely CM1,
CM2 where the primary difference between the modes was the
injection strategy. The CM1 mode was extended up to
diesel
11.6 bar BMEP when compared to the 9.9 bar BMEP of CM2, because
of the more robust combustion control provided by its near TDC
diesel injection timing, which provided a more stratified reactivity
distribution. CM2 used early diesel injection and a lower diesel
injection pressure compared to CM1 operation due to the sufficient
time available for the air and fuel to mix. The maximum PFI per-
centage recorded for CM2 operation was 93% compared to 82% for
CM1 operation for stable engine operation. Two major factors
limited the extension of load with CM1 beyond 11.6 bar BMEP; (1)
excessively high pressure rise rates and (2) deteriorated combus-
tion stability. The best BTE recorded for CM2 was 42.1% at 9.9 bar
BMEP while it was 43.6% for CM1 at 11.6 bar BMEP. The study also
tested E85/diesel dual operation and demonstrated maximum load
operation of 19 bar BMEP. The reduced reactivity of E85 was
effective in extending the load range and required less EGR, lower
PFI fractions compared to gasoline/diesel combustion. The best BTE
of E85/diesel combustion was 45.1% and the maximum PRR reached
was 14 bar/deg at 19 bar BMEP.

3.8.6. Methanol/diesel reactivity controlled compression ignition
(RCCI) engine

Methanol/diesel reactivity controlled compression ignition en-
gine combustion and its emission characteristics were investigated
by Li et al. [85]. In this study the effect of the mass fraction of
methanol, SOI and intake temperature was investigated. The results
show that both the amount of premixed methanol and SOI have a
significant impact on the reactivity distribution. It was also noticed
that, when the methanol mass fraction was increased from 0 to 80%
i.e.,
the peak pressure and heat release rates were retarded,

Fig. 64. Effect of SOI on HC and CO [90].

This operating condition was also explored in Ref. [50], where
optical tests of the combustion process were conducted. In that
research optics were installed into a modified cylinder head that
was limited to low PRR (~4 bar/(cid:2)) and peak cylinder pressure for
structural considerations. In that case the combustion timing was
adjusted from the optimal efficiency timing to maintain the PRR.
More recent results by Hanson et al. [55] have demonstrated
improved operation with low pressure rise rates at the lighter
loads, with a gross based ISFC of 155 g/kWh and corresponding
gross thermal efficiency of 54%. This study demonstrated that with
an injection strategy optimized for mid-load, good results are
possible at both low and high load operation. It has also been
demonstrated that fuel effects and the resulting reactivity gradients
are responsible for controlling the combustion event.

Model-based dual fuel combustion optimization was performed
by Zhang et al. [83] on a Navistar 12.4 L HD truck engine at 11 bar
BMEP and 1531 rev/min. Design of Experiments (DOE) was used to
explore various engine operating parameters such as compression
ratio, A/F ratio, EGR rate, G/D ratio, single and double diesel in-
jections, split ratio between two diesel injections and injection
timings. The optimization recommended suitable diesel injection
strategies and air system targets that were required for stable en-
gine operation. The KIVA-3V release 2 code coupled with CHEMKIN
II was used for the combustion optimization. In the study iso-
octane and n-heptane was used as gasoline and diesel surrogates.
A reduced PRF mechanism that consists of 45 species and 142 re-
actions was used to simulate the gasoline and diesel fuel chemistry.
The combustion optimization was done from compression ratio

combustion was phased closer to TDC due to improved charge
homogeneity and reactivity distribution (see Fig. 48).
It was
observed that while increasing methanol fraction, the high CN
diesel fuel ignited first followed by the low CN methanol which
shortened the combustion duration compared to premixed com-
bustion of methanol instead of mixing controlled combustion of
diesel. Addition of methanol was also beneficial in terms of HC and
CO emissions, especially at less than 60% PFI fraction. Li et al. [85]
inferred that compared to a PCCI strategy with diesel, methanol/
diesel RCCI combustion with higher intake temperatures provides a
beneficial path for fuel efficiency and emission reductions. Overall,
it was demonstrated that methanol/diesel combustion is capable of
reducing emissions and improving fuel efficiency.

As a follow up study, Li et al. [86] performed an optimization of
an RCCI engine fueled with methanol and diesel using a non-
dominated sorting genetic algorithm II
(NSGA-II) modeling
approach. Parameters included the mass fraction of methanol,
EGR rate, IVC pressure, IVC temperature and SOI. The sensitivity of
fuel efficiency, emissions, ignition timing and RI these parameters
was analyzed. The investigation confirms that IVC temperature
and EGR rate were the most significant operating parameters for
overall engine performance and emissions due to their influence
on the in-cylinder gas temperature. Also, it was noticed that
higher energy fractions of methanol, namely more than 70% (refer
to Fig. 49) with advanced SOI provided higher fuel efficiency and
lower emissions. The study also revealed that adjusting the
methanolediesel ratio is the only feasible solution to control the
ignition timing and to have acceptable levels of RI and CA50.

3.8.7. Hydrogen addition to DME/CH4 dual fuel RCCI engine

The effect of hydrogen addition to a DME/CH4 dual-fuel RCCI
engine was investigated by Liu et al. [87] using three dimensional
calculations coupled with chemical kinetics. Their study also pro-
posed a new reduced DME (Dimethyl Ether) oxidation mechanism.
Addition of hydrogen was seen to advance the ignition timing and
increase the peak cylinder pressure. The simulations showed that
hydrogen addition has a greater effect on the early stages of com-
bustion, which resulted in low CH4 and CO emissions. Addition of
hydrogen increased the NO emissions, but this trend depended on
the injection strategy and quantity of pilot fuel used. From the
simulations it was inferred that by optimizing these two parame-
ters the NOx emissions could be controlled.

3.9. Extension of RCCI to LD engines

Based on the results from the ERC heavy-duty (HD) engine RCCI
studies, Kokjohn et al. [88] applied the RCCI concept to a light-duty
(LD) engine, and comparisons were made between the LD and HD
engine platforms. The light-duty engine was the single cylinder
version of the GM 1.9 L diesel and is typical of an automotive
application. The light-duty engine displacement volume is ~5 times
smaller than the heavy-duty engine and its specifications were
given in Table 2.

3.9.1. Comparisons of RCCI combustion between HD and LD engines

As discussed earlier, most of the optimization work in the HD
engine was performed at 9.3 bar IMEP. Hence, 9.3 bar IMEP oper-
ation was also the focus of comparisons between the LD and HD
engines in Ref. [89].

The operating conditions for the two engines are presented in
Table 31. If the sizes of the engines were perfectly scaled [88], the
LD engine would need to be operated at around 3800 instead of
1300 rev/min to scale the heat transfer losses. To make a compro-
mise between the kinetics (which should be same) and heat
transfer timescales, an intermediate speed of 1900 rev/min was
selected. The premixed gasoline fraction was used to control the
combustion phasing and to account for the differences in the
speeds between the two engines. The quantity of premixed gaso-
line in the HD engine was swept from 82 to 89% by mass and the
quantity of the premixed gasoline in the LD engine was swept from
81 to 84% by mass. Note that the range of the premixed gasoline
fraction sweeps for the LD and HD engines are different due to
several factors. First, since the engine speed of the light-duty en-
gine is higher than that of the HD engine, and the LD engine has less
time available for ignition, and for a given fuel blend, the LD engine
will ignite later than that of the heavy-duty engine. Furthermore,
the heat transfer differences between the two engines may result in
differences in the thermal conditions.

Fig. 50 shows cylinder pressure and apparent heat release rates
for the light-and heavy-duty engines over the premixed gasoline
percentage sweeps. Note that to facilitate comparisons between the
two engines operating at different speeds, the heat release rates are
normalized by the fuel energy and shown as time derivatives (i.e., 1/
ms), rather than crank angle derivatives. It can be seen that in both
engines the combustion phasing is easily controlled by adjusting
the premixed gasoline percentage. That is, increasing the gasoline
mass percentage in the fuel results in a very predictable delay in the
combustion phasing.

The predictable dependence of combustion phasing on the pre-
mixed gasoline percentage has several implications for practical
application of the RCCI combustion concept. First, an engine oper-
ating in the RCCI combustion mode must have accurate control over
the fuel quantity delivered in each of the two fuel streams. Second,
the RCCI combustion process regains the coupling between the in-
jection and the combustion events that is lost with traditional HCCI
or early injection PCCI combustion. Notice that the dependence of
combustion phasing on the premixed gasoline percentage is
different for the two engines; however, recall that the two engines
were operated at different speeds. For the LD engine a percent in-
crease in the premixed gasoline and corresponding decrease in the
direct injected diesel quantity resulted in a retard in combustion
phasing of 2(cid:2) CA at 1900 rev/min or 175 ms, while for the HD engine a
percent increase in the premixed gasoline percentage resulted in a
retard in combustion phasing of 0.6 (cid:2)CA at 1300 rev/min or 78 ms.
The increase for the LD engine is likely due to the increased
expansion rate due to the higher engine speed. Thus, it appears that
at higher engine speeds the combustion phasing becomes more
sensitive to changes in the premixed gasoline percentage.

load traces are on the right [91].

From Fig. 50 it is noticed that the NOx levels are significantly
below the 2010 HD limits. However, it can be seen that for similar
combustion phasing the NOx emission for the LD engine is slightly
higher than the limits. NOx decreased significantly as the com-
bustion phasing was retarded further. Soot emissions were nearly
identical for the two engines and, similar to the NOx both engines
had soot levels below the 2010 HD limit. In addition, both engines
had acceptable ringing intensities (RI). More importantly the en-
gines show significant control over the RI via changes in the pre-
mixed gasoline percentage. Comparing gross indicated efficiencies
it can be seen that the HD engine showed ~7% higher indicated
efficiency than the LD engine. This difference in gross indicated
efficiencies (see Figs. 51 and 52) was found to be due to increased
combustion losses, i.e., higher HC and CO and increased heat
transfer.

3.9.2. Methods to reduce heat transfer losses in LD engines

From Fig. 53 it was observed that the heat transfer losses are
higher for the LD engine. This could be due to several reasons. First,

the swirl ratio of the LD engine was more than three times higher
than that of the HD engine. Next, the LD engine operates at a lower
mean piston speed than the HD engine. Finally, the two engines
have different combustion chamber and injector geometries. The
combustion chamber geometry influences heat transfer losses
directly through the amount of wall surface area. In this case the
surface-to-volume ratio of the LD engine was more than two-times
higher than that of the HD engine. Furthermore, the combination of
combustion chamber and injector geometry can also play a role in
heat transfer losses via the fuel distribution.

In a comparison between heat transfer losses in RCCI and con-
ventional diesel combustion, Kokjohn et al. [60] showed that heat
transfer losses were reduced for RCCI combustion not only through
reductions in the peak temperature, but also by keeping high
temperature regions away from the piston surface. Thus, it is of
interest to apply the combustion chamber and injector geometry of
the heavy-duty engine to the light-duty engine. Accordingly, the
heavy-duty engine geometry was scaled down to the light-duty
displacement by applying a scaling factor defined as the cube

root of the ratio of the light-duty to heavy-duty TDC volumes. The
specifications of the heavy-duty engine, baseline light-duty engine,
and scaled geometry light-duty engine are shown in Table 32 and a
comparison of the three combustion chamber geometries is shown
in Fig. 53.

Table 33 shows the high and low levels of swirl ratio, engine
speed and combustion chamber geometry that were investigated
to study their effects. The range of swirl ratios investigated was
bounded by the swirl ratios of the LD and HD engines, respec-
tively. The engine speed increase was considered by increasing the
speed to give the scaled geometry of the LD engine the same mean
piston speed as that of the heavy-duty engine (note that this is a
relatively small increase in engine speed). Finally, the effect of
combustion chamber geometry was investigated by considering
the piston geometries of both the HD and LD engines, as

previously discussed. Note that the scaled light-duty combustion
chamber has a geometric compression ratio of 16.1:1. In this study
meticulous steps were taken to isolate the influences of the varied
parameters and combustion phasing. The combustion phasing
(CA50 1⁄4 2(cid:2)CA aTDC) was selected in such a way that the cases with
low engine speed and high compression ratio operated with
premixed iso-octane (PRF 100). Tables 34 and 35 show the results
of the heat transfer reduction investigation at a constant CA50 of
2(cid:2)CA aTDC (Fig. 54).

A final comparison was made between the LD and HD engines
and it was found that with the improved parameters the LD engine
was able to achieve 53% gross indicated efficiency, while main-
taining near zero NOx and soot and an acceptable ringing intensity,
which is comparable to the performance of the HD engine, as
shown in Table 35.

4. RCCI For improved efficiency and low emissions on a multi-
cylinder LD diesel engine

specifications are given in Table 2, and a schematic diagram of the
test engine was shown in Fig. 2.

Curran et al. [90] investigated in-cylinder blending of gasoline
with diesel fuel on a multi-cylinder LD diesel engine as a strategy to
control in-cylinder fuel reactivity for improved efficiency and the
lowest possible emissions. The objective of their study was to
develop better understanding of the potential and challenges of
RCCI on a multi-cylinder engine. More specifically, the effect of
cylinder-to-cylinder imbalances and in-cylinder charge motion as
well as the potential limitations imposed by real world turbo-
chargers were investigated on a 1.9 L four-cylinder engine that is
similar to the ERC LD engine. The investigation focused on one
engine operating condition 2300 rev/min, 5.5 bar net mean effec-
tive pressure (NMEP).

Parameter sweeps in the investigation included variations of the
gasoline-to-diesel fuel ratio, intake charge mixture temperature,
in-cylinder swirl level and diesel start-of-injection timings. In
addition, engine parameters were trimmed for each cylinder to
balance the combustion process for maximum efficiency and
lowest emissions. An important observation was the strong influ-
ence of the intake charge temperature on the cylinder pressure rise
rate. The work was guided by the dual fuel modeling and experi-
ments of Refs. [8,34]. The operating point mentioned was chosen
such that no EGR would have to be used to allow simplified
cylinder-to-cylinder balancing and to avoid thermal management
of the EGR cooler. To further simplify the multi-cylinder engine
experiments, a single direct injection of diesel fuel was used instead
of a split injection strategy. The engine operating parameters were
based on the multi-dimensional CFD modeling and single cylinder
experiments performed by Kokjohn and Reitz [88]. The test engine

The goal of the work was to provide a roadmap of how to ach-
ieve improved efficiency with the lowest possible emissions with
dual-fuel RCCI in a multi-cylinder LD diesel engine. To this end, the
dual-fuel RCCI performance and emissions were compared against
conventional diesel combustion at the 2300 rev/min, 5.5 bar NMEP
modal point. Diesel SOI timing sweeps were performed to compare
multi-cylinder dual-fuel performance against the model pre-
dictions. No manual cylinder balancing was done for the conven-
tional diesel combustion mode and the natural cylinder-to-cylinder
imbalances are obvious in the graphs of NMEP and MFB50 for each
cylinder in Figs. 54 and 55. These imbalances clearly show the need
for control over each cylinder in the RCCI combustion mode. The
performance and emission data for the CDC condition are shown in
Table 36.

4.1. Dual fuel modeling and experiments

The experimental and modeling study of dual fuel RCCI is
summarized in Table 37 [90]. Predicted ISFC maps over the diesel
fuel SOI timing sweep, NOx, HC, CO, cylinder pressure and heat
release rates are shown in Figs. 56e59 [90].

4.1.1. RCCI multi-cylinder experiments

The effects of intake charge temperature, swirl and diesel SOI
timing are presented in Figs. 60e65 [90]. The effect of intake charge
temperatures on cylinder pressure rise rate and combustion
phasing is shown in Fig. 60. It can be seen that, at a fixed gasoline
and diesel fuel ratio, as the intake temperature was varied from 39(cid:2)
to 44 (cid:2)C, CA 50 advanced by 2(cid:2) CA. The advanced CA 50 resulted in

an increase in MPRR by nearly a factor of two. These results show
the importance of controlling the combustion phasing to control
the MPRR and the need for precise control for intake charge vari-
ations. Like intake temperature, during the course of the experi-
ments it was found that adjusting the swirl ratio had a significant
effect on both thermal efficiency and emissions for dual-fuel RCCI
operation, as shown in Fig. 62. Fig. 61 shows a representative
pressure and heat release rate plot from the 81% gasoline case for
various swirl ratios, demonstrating that, as the swirl level increases,
the heat release rate is reduced while the peak cylinder pressure
and the area under the pressure curve increase. To find the opti-
mum swirl ratio for each ratio of gasoline-to-diesel fuel tested, a
sweep of swirl valve position (i.e., swirl ratio) was performed for
the 77%, 81% and 85% gasoline cases at a diesel SOI timing of (cid:4)60(cid:2)
ATDC (swirl valve angles of 0(cid:2) and 90(cid:2) correspond to the lowest and
highest swirl ratios, respectively).

Fig. 62 shows the effect of swirl ratio on BTE and net and gross
ITE for the 77% gasoline case. It was found that thermal efficiency
is strongly affected by changing the swirl ratio. The thermal effi-
ciency was found to increase with a more open swirl valve, indi-
cating that better in-cylinder mixing is needed to realize the
maximum thermal efficiency with the current multi-cylinder
configuration (i.e., single diesel
injector technology,
compression ratio).

Fig. 63 shows cylinder pressure and heat release rates for the
diesel fuel SOI timing sweep from (cid:4)30(cid:2) to (cid:4)60(cid:2) ATDC at a swirl
valve angle of 65.7(cid:2). When the diesel SOI timing was advanced
to (cid:4)70(cid:2) ATDC, combustion was found to be unstable. The trends of
pressure and heat release from the multi-cylinder engine experi-
ment agreed well with the modeling predictions, as shown in
Fig. 63. The two peaks for the case with a diesel SOI timing of (cid:4)30(cid:2)
seem to indicate two-mode combustion. These trends also held for

different swirl ratios and for the 85% gasoline case, as explained in
the dual-fuel RCCI work of Hanson et al. [34]. The HC and CO
emissions trends for the diesel SOI sweeps are shown in Fig. 64, and
the NOx trends for 81% and 85% gasoline are shown in Fig. 65.

This work successfully demonstrated the application of dual-
fuel RCCI operation on a multi-cylinder LD engine and the model
results were valuable in directing the experiments. The work also
showed the relationship between intake and temperature and
gasoline-to-diesel fuel ratio during dual-fuel operation. The need
for
turbo-
machinery for
low temperature combustion also became
apparent due to the observed importance of boost pressure.

4.2. Effect of alternative fuels on RCCI performance and emissions

4.2.1. Heavy-duty engine natural gas e diesel RCCI operation

To operate at moderate to high loads with gasoline/diesel dual
fuel, high amounts of EGR or an ultra-low compression ratio had
been found to be required. Considering that both of these ap-
proaches inherently lower thermodynamic efficiency, Nieman et al.
[91] replaced the gasoline with natural gas as the low reactivity fuel
and examined the sensitivity of RCCI combustion at high load to
injection system parameters. Due to the lower reactivity of natural
gas compared to gasoline, it was proposed to be a better fuel for
RCCI combustion to control the maximum pressure rise rate by
using the large reactivity gradient that exists between these two
fuels.

A nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) along with
the CFD code described in 2.1.3 was used to perform optimization
for a wide range of engine operating conditions. Engine design
parameters that were controlled by the genetic algorithm included
the fraction of total fuel that was premixed (methane), the timing of
the two diesel injections, the amount of diesel in each injection, the
diesel fuel injection pressure, and the EGR percentage. The objec-
tive of the optimization was to simultaneously minimize soot, NOx,
CO, and UHC emissions, as well as ISFC and ringing intensity.
Typical heavy-duty engine load/speed combinations at six oper-
ating points from 4 to 23 bar IMEP and 800e1800 rev/min were
investigated on the test engine shown in Fig. 1 and optimized. The
results emphasized that precise injection control was needed for
combustion control. The load speed combinations, which ranged
from low-load/low-speed to high-load/high-speed, proposed by
Dempsey et al. [21] were selected for the optimization of natural
gas/diesel operation [91]. At each operating condition, the engine

speed, fuel energy introduced into the cylinder, and intake pressure
were fixed throughout the optimization. The conditions, the cor-
responding IMEP values, and variable design parameters are listed
in Table 38.

As indicated in Fig. 66, efficient combustion strategies were
achieved over the entire load/speed range. NOx and soot emissions
regulations were met across the entire range with the exception of
soot at high load. However, high EGR levels at the 23 bar IMEP
condition reduced combustion efficiency, and at the 4 bar IMEP
condition, the ultra-low reactivity of methane caused the com-
bustion efficiency to be relatively poor. However, the low load and
high load case employed a later second injection, which occurred at
approximately (cid:4)20(cid:2) aTDC and acted as a strong ignition source. The
13.5 bar IMEP case required the least amount of diesel fuel (on
percent basis) and it was noticed that the diesel fraction decreased
as load was increased, because the background equivalence ratio of
methane was increased, thus increasing its reactivity and less diesel
fuel was needed to ignite the mixture. This trend continued until
16 bar IMEP.

A comparison between the optimum 9 bar IMEP gasoline/diesel
HD RCCI strategy developed by Kokjohn et al. [8,26,34,33] and the
9 bar IMEP natural gas/diesel strategy described in Fig. 66 is seen in

Fig. 72. BTE for G & E85 compared to CDC [93].

Fig. 67. The gasoline/diesel strategy was optimized at a relatively
high intake pressure of 1.75 bar absolute, while the natural gas/
diesel strategy utilized 1.45 bar intake pressure. The combustion
event of the gasoline/diesel strategy was retarded with lower
intake pressure, whereas the natural gas/diesel strategy was un-
affected by the changed intake pressure.

The use of natural gas as the low-reactivity fuel in the RCCI
combustion strategy is seen to be able to yield clean, quiet and
efficient combustion throughout the entire tested load/speed
range. Additional work by Nieman [92] has shown that the use of
triple injections is effective to further reduce NOx and PM at high
and low loads, as shown in Fig. 68 and Table 39.

4.2.2. Use of E85-diesel in a light-duty multi-cylinder engine

The effect of alternative fuels, i.e., E85 on load expansion and
Federal Test Procedure (FTP) modal point emissions indices under
RCCI operation has been investigated by Curran et al. [93]. The GM
1.9L four-cylinder engine shown in Fig. 2 was modified to allow
port fuel injection and operated with E85. The effect of E85 on the
Ad-hoc FTP modal points was explored, along with the effect of
load expansion throughout the LD diesel engine's speed range.
Previous results [90] with gasoline-diesel dual-fuel operation
showed that with the stock hardware, the 2600 rev/min, 8.8 bar
BMEP modal point was not obtainable due to an excessive cylinder
pressure rise rate and unstable combustion both with and without

EGR. In this experiment the performance and emissions of RCCI
operation with E85 and diesel was explored and compared against
CDC and RCCI operation with gasoline and diesel. The use of
for
renewable fuels such as E85 not only has the potential
expanding the operating load of RCCI, but also is effective for
decreasing petroleum energy use through a combination of direct
petroleum displacement and increased efficiency, as well as a
reduction in life-cycle emissions.

Formaldehyde emissions were not examined by Curran et al.
[93], but a previous study [94] revealed increased HCHO production
compared to CDC and PCCI with RCCI operation. It was concluded
that a diesel oxidation catalyst could be effective in controlling the
tailpipe emissions. RCCI operation with E85 was achieved through
early DI (single or double pulse) of diesel fuel (between 30 and 70(cid:2)
bTDC) and port fueling of E85 onto a closed intake valve. The fuel
rail pressure was decreased to 500 bar as the diesel fuel start of
injection was advanced to avoid spray impingement on the cylinder
walls. For RCCI operation with the stock piston geometry and stock
DI diesel injectors, it was found that increased swirl intensity is
needed to create a well-mixed cylinder charge [93] for the highest
BTE and lowest possible emissions, and the mass ratio of premixed
fuel to direct injected fuel varied depending on engine speed and
load. As the load increased, the premixed fuel ratio was required to
increase and SOI was advanced toward 60(cid:2) bTDC for both gasoline
and E85, as shown in Fig. 69.

Previous studies [90] have shown that the maximum BTE was
obtained with a minimum amount of pre-mixed fuel, but enough to
control the pressure rise rate. The same holds true with keeping the
diesel SOI as retarded as possible since, as the diesel SOI becomes
more advanced, the mixture is more premixed and less stable, and
more HCCI-like combustion occurs. The combined effect of higher

octane and intake cooling effects made higher load operation
difficult with E85, namely, the stability of combustion was reduced.
The effect can almost be described as self-extinguishing. Higher
boost pressures were needed, but the stock VGT was not suited for
supplying the requisite boost pressure with the low exhaust tem-
peratures associated with RCCI operation. To combat this effect, a
split injection technique was used for the 2600 rev/min, 8.8 bar
BMEP operating point. This point was not reachable with RCCI
operation using gasoline even with EGR. The sensitivity of higher-
load RCCI operation to intake temperature makes the use of high-
pressure EGR difficult in terms of cooling the EGR sufficiently
without condensing HC in the EGR cooler. In order to reach the
2600 rev/min, 8.8 bar BMEP operating point with E85 RCCI, the
intake temperature had to be lowered to approximately 40 (cid:2)C in
order to keep the cylinder pressure rise rate under the self-imposed
limit of 10 bar/deg. However, the use of E85 in RCCI operation
allowed the amount of DI diesel fuel to be increased. The cylinder
pressure and heat release rate traces for RCCI operation over the
speed and load range of the Ad-hoc modal points is shown for
gasoline and E85 in Figs. 70 and 71, respectively. The peak cylinder
pressure for higher load RCCI operation was increased and there
was a slight increase in NOx emissions, as discussed next. It is also
apparent from the heat release traces that combustion phasing is
generally advanced with E85.

From Fig. 72 it can be seen that the BTE of CDC is higher than
gasoline-diesel RCCI operation and E85-diesel operation at 1 bar
and 2.6 bar BMEP (at 1500 rev/min) and 2 bar BMEP (at 2000 rev/
min). But, at 4.2 bar BMEP, 2300 rev/min and 8.8 bar BMEP,
2600 rev/min the efficiency of E85-diesel RCCI
is more than
gasoline-diesel RCCI and CDC operation. It is clearly seen that E85-
diesel RCCI operation provides better BTE at higher loads than at
lower loads, and the improvements in BTE of E85/D with CDC at
4.2 bar BMEP and 8.8 bar BMEP are 8.8% and 6.9% respectively. The
higher BTE at the higher loads with RCCI operation with E85 is
attributed to the lower premixed fuel amount allowed by the use of
E85.

The NOx emissions of RCCI operation with E85 are marginally
higher than for RCCI operation with gasoline at almost all loads and
speed, but lower compared to CDC operation at all load and speeds.
The lower premixed fuel-to-diesel ratio with E85 leads to slightly
higher NOx mass emissions at the lowest loads since much more
is required to maintain stable operation. The NOx
diesel fuel
emission trends for CDC, G/D RCCI and E85/D RCCI operation are
depicted in Fig. 73 [93].

PM emissions estimated from the soot concentration correlation
from the filter smoke number (FSN) are shown in Fig. 74. The results
indicated that engine-out PM emissions from RCCI operation were

with both the PFI fuels were higher than with CDC operation. The
brake specific CO emissions ranged from 10 to 63 g/kWh for RCCI
operation compared to 0.55e25 g/kWh for CDC operation. The CO
emissions averaged around 3800 ppm for RCCI with gasoline and
3300 ppm for RCCI with E85. At the 2300 rev/min, 4.2 bar point,
E85 RCCI CO emissions were below 1500 ppm.

The exhaust temperatures as measured at the turbocharger
outlet are shown in Fig. 77. The exhaust temperatures for RCCI
operation range from 22% to 35% lower than that of CDC operation.
This correlates to around a 20 (cid:2)C difference at the lower loads and
up to a 112 (cid:2)C difference at the higher loads. The exhaust temper-
atures for E85 RCCI are slightly higher than RCCI with gasoline by an
average of approximately 6%.

Curran et al. [93] concluded that, despite successful RCCI with
the stock engine configuration, hardware challenges still exist,
especially in the turbo machinery and the HP EGR system. In the
case of the stock VGT, the higher load operation demanded more
boost, which was not possible with the exhaust temperatures that
existed in RCCI operation. Similarly, at lower loads increased boost
levels are required to improve BTE. In addition, due to the limitation
of the VGT to drive the EGR and due to condensation of the hy-
drocarbons in the EGR cooler with low intake temperatures, it is
difficult for HP EGR to provide the high dilution levels demanded by
higher load RCCI operation. Thus, it was suggested that future study
should focus on using mixed LP and HP EGR systems.

4.2.3. Effect of DI fuel (diesel & 3% 2-EHN doped gasoline)
properties on engine gross thermal efficiency

The effect of dual fuel and single fuel strategies on gross thermal
efficiency of RCCI engines has been studied by various groups.
Splitter et al. [95] studied the effect of direct-injected fuel proper-
ties on gross thermal efficiency with respect to intake pressure and
temperature, and equivalence ratio as function of engine operating
parameters, such as fuel reactivity, CA50 and load. In Splitter et al.
the gross thermal efficiency of the engine was maximized at
approximately 67% of premixed fuel and 33% of DI fuel. In this
investigation two fuels namely, #2 ULSD and 3% 2-ethylhexyl ni-
trate doped gasoline were used as the DI fuel to study fuel property
effects on RCCI efficiency. The experiments were conducted in the
heavy-duty single-cylinder engine shown in Fig. 1 at constant net
IMEP of 8.45 bar, 1300 rev/min engine speed, with 0% EGR, and a
CA50 combustion phasing of 0.5 (cid:2)CA ATDC. The engine was port-
fueled with E85 for the low reactivity fuel and direct-injected

nearly zero. Though these PM emissions are nearly zero, previous
work has shown that the apparent mass of RCCI PM as collected on
filter paper can be higher than CDC or PCCI due to the amount of
soluble organic fraction (SOF) present. The FSN for RCCI operation
with both E85 and gasoline averaged at 0.01, which indicates very
little opacity in the exhaust. The FSN for CDC operation varied from
as low as 0.23 for the 2300 rev/min, 4.2 bar BMEP case to as high as
1.66 for the 1500 rev/min, 2.6 bar BMEP case.

The hydrocarbon emissions for G/D RCCI and E85/D RCCI were
higher than for CDC operation (see Fig. 75). RCCI with E85 provided
decreased HC emissions compared to RCCI with gasoline and this
decrease in HC was observed with increases in load and speed. The
reason for the reduction in HC emissions for E85 RCCI was arranged
to be due to the decreased premixed fuel ratio, which is enabled by
the higher octane, as well as due to the intake cooling effect of E85.
Brake specific HC emissions were found to decrease with increasing
load for both PFI fuels. Brake specific hydrocarbons varied from as
low as 10 g/kWh for E85 RCCI to as high as 48 g/kWh with RCCI with
gasoline for the 2000 rev/min, 2.0 bar BMEP case. RCCI HC emis-
sions averaged around 2600 ppm for E85 RCCI and 3200 ppm for
RCCI with gasoline.

The CO emissions followed the same trends as seen for the HC
emissions, as shown in Fig. 76. At lower load, CO emissions for RCCI
with E85 were higher than RCCI with gasoline and vice versa at the
higher load, but at all the loads and speed CO emissions of RCCI

with either #2 ULSD or 3% 2-ethylhexyl nitrate doped into gasoline
for the high reactivity fuel. The experimental results showed that
fuel reactivity differences affect engine efficiency magnitudes, and
also the findings demonstrated that losses could be minimized
through proper balancing of the intake pressure and temperature,
as a function of the fuel reactivity differences. In their study the
intake pressure and temperature were swept independently of
each other while combustion phasing and load were maintained by
adjusting the global fuel reactivity and DI fuel timing as required.
Particularly with the EHN þ Gas/E85 strategy, at reduced high and
low reactivity fuel differences, it was noticed that combustion was

more abrupt due to reduced effectiveness of the DI fuel. The results
demonstrated that through proper optimization of both engine
conditions, and the fuels, further increases in engine efficiency
were possible with RCCI.

4.3. Piston bowl optimization for RCCI combustion in a LD multi-
cylinder engine

Based on the above RCCI studies, in order to reduce unburned
fuel emissions and the piston bowl surface area (to reduce heat
losses), improved pistons were designed by Hanson et al. [96]
with assistance of the KIVA 3V CFD code and genetic algorithm
optimization. The piston bowl profile was optimized for dedicated
RCCI operation and it was tested in the test engine shown in Fig. 2
at three operating points. These operating points were chosen to
cover the range of conditions seen in the US EPA LD FTP tests. The
operating points were those chosen by an Ad Hoc working group
to simulate operation in the FTP test [97,98]. Hanson et al. [96]
found that the thermal efficiency of the optimized engine was
improved, while maintaining low NOx and PM emissions. The
results showed that with the new piston bowl profile and an
optimized injection schedule, RCCI brake thermal efficiency was
increased from 37% with the stock EURO IV configuration to 40% at
the 2600 rev/min, 6.9 bar BMEP condition, and NOx and PM
emissions targets were met without the need for exhaust after
treatment.

4.3.1. Cylinder balancing with RCCI

In a multi-cylinder engine there are significant variations in the
initial conditions, i.e., cylinder temperature, EGR, trapped mass, fuel
rail pressure, etc., from cylinder-to-cylinder. These imbalances can
lead to decreased performance due to overly advanced or delayed
combustion in each cylinder in a kinetically controlled combustion
strategy like RCCI. Exhaust emissions can also vary significantly
from each cylinder with corresponding variations in combustion
phasing. To adjust for these variations, the total fueling and ratio of
gasoline-to-diesel for each cylinder can be varied to match the
IMEP and combustion phasing over all 4 cylinders (see Fig. 78).

The balancing was accomplished by Hanson et al. [96] using the
Drivven code by applying an “adjustment factor” multiplier to the
PFI and DI duration commands for each cylinder. First, for each
cylinder, the DI and PFI adjustment factors were tuned to vary the
ratio of gasoline-to-diesel fuel to match CA50 over all 4 cylinders.
Next, once the combustion phasing was balanced, the PFI and DI
adjustment factors were then raised or lowered in equal amounts
to match the IMEP over all 4 cylinders. Typically, the PFI and DI

adjustment factors needed to be varied by ±10% from cylinder-to-
cylinder. Sample results of the cylinder balancing for a typical
operating condition are shown in Fig. 78.

4.3.2. RCCI piston design

Conventional diesel engines are designed for non-premixed fuel
burning in a mixing-controlled combustion mode. This type of
combustion uses the piston geometry to assist fuel/air mixing and
ensure complete combustion. Additional mixing from piston-bowl-
generated flows is not required in RCCI combustion due to the early
fuel injections, which allow additional time for sufficient mixing
before combustion. Therefore, a dedicated RCCI engine requires a
bowl shape that is optimized for RCCI operation to fully realize the
benefits of this premixed combustion strategy. An optimized RCCI
piston was used in the multi-cylinder engine and the LD RCCI piston
design was based on Refs. [99,100]. CFD engine simulations using
the KIVA code were used to examine bowl shape parameters to
increase thermal efficiency and reduce emissions of RCCI operation
in the LD engine.

The two parameters varied in the piston design were the bowl
diameter and compression ratio in order to determine the limits of
the design parameters through modeling. The bore radius was
varied from a narrow, diesel type bowl to nearly flat piston
(48e98% of the piston radius). The specific conditions for the CFD
simulations were chosen from previously tested RCCI cases (see
Table 40). From the CFD simulations it was found that, when bowl

radius was varied from 2 to 4 cm, the gross indicated thermal ef-
ficiency increases with increase in bowl radius, as seen in Fig. 78.
Based on this result, the bowl radius was fixed close to 4 cm. This
resulted in a wider bowl that covered most of the piston. Next, the
compression ratio selection was made through further CFD simu-
lations at a constant radius of 4 cm and constant combustion
phasing, as discussed in Refs.
[8,17,26,76] with increase in
compression ratio from 15.25 to 18.1 (Fig. 79).

As expected, the higher compression ratio led to higher gross
indicated thermal efficiency and a decrease in HC emissions, as
shown in Fig. 80. HC emissions could also be decreased at lower
compression ratios by increasing the intake temperature from 40
to 55 (cid:2)C. The combustion efficiency improvements can make up
about half of the efficiency gain from increasing the compression
ratio alone. Based on these results, a compression ratio of 16.1:1
was selected to allow for improved low load operation with
acceptable high load operation, keeping in mind that the LD
vehicle would operate more exclusively at light loads. Based on the
selected compression ratio (16.1:1) and bowl radius (4 cm) the HD
RCCI piston (CR 1⁄4 14.88:1) was directly scaled to fit the LD piston
blank, but due to structural concerns over the bowl-to-ring land
clearance; the bowl radius was reduced to 3.721 cm. Finally, it must
be noted that, while the piston was designed to be 16.1:1
compression ratio, the compression ratio of the final machined
RCCI piston was measured in the engine to be ~15.1:1. (This dif-
ference was thought to be caused by machining errors to the piston

4.3.3. Experimental results of optimized LD RCCI pistons

Experiments were conducted by Hanson et al. [96] on the multi-
cylinder test engine at the three operating points mentioned earlier
with the optimized RCCI piston. The details of the operating

conditions at each point are given in Table 41. Hanson et al. [96]
conducted the test with three different engine configurations of
Fig. 81 and compared the results. The 1500 rev/min operating point
is a typical light-load cruising point in the LD FTP test. Hanson et al.
used a single injection strategy for the RCCI OEM piston double
injection strategy and the OEM injection strategy for the CDC OE
piston. Combustion phasing for all cases was advanced as far as

possible to reduce HC and CO emissions while keeping the
maximum PRR below 10 bar/degCA and maintaining the highest
possible brake thermal efficiency. Comparisons of heat release rate,
cylinder pressure traces and rail pressure at all three speeds are
given in Fig. 82.

From Fig. 82a,b,c it is noticed that the combustion is faster and
occurs earlier for the RCCI piston than for CDC combustion. The CDC
case has late combustion, which resulted in reduced cylinder
pressure and heat release rates compared to the RCCI combustion
case. The combustion phasing is observed to be same for all three
speed conditions. The rail pressure used in the three cases is also
shown in Fig. 82(d). It is interesting note that the OEM case actually
uses lower rail pressure than for the RCCI at 1500 rev/min case.
Engine-out emissions for all the cases are shown in Fig. 83. As ex-
pected, HC and CO were higher with NOx and PM being lower than
CDC with RCCI operation. This is in agreement with previous RCCI
studies [8,26,29,99].

As seen in the previous RCCI studies, the increased HC and CO
emissions were thought to be caused by a combination of the low
combustion temperatures and crevice volumes that can trap un-
burned PFI fuel. The custom RCCI piston was designed to lower HC
emissions by reducing the squish area and crevice volume. How-
ever, the RCCI piston was unable to significantly reduce HC
compared to RCCI operation with the OEM piston in the MCE. This
suggests that the squish area may not be the main source of HC
emissions. The next possible source of HC is likely to be the piston-
to-liner crevice volume.

More work is needed to definitively determine the source of HC
emissions. CO emissions from RCCI generally follow the peak
combustion chamber temperature, and this is seen by the reduction
of CO with increased load. HC emissions were not found to be as
sensitive to the combustion chamber temperature (i.e., load) as CO,
again suggesting they are mainly a function of unburned fuel
escaping combustion in the engine crevices. The temperature effect

was also seen with the RCCI piston having higher CO than the OEM
piston due to the lower in-cylinder temperatures with the reduced
compression ratio of the custom piston.

In summary, Hanson et al. [96] demonstrated that RCCI com-
bustion can be operated in multi-cylinder engines over a wide
speed/load range, and that RCCI optimized pistons offer emissions
and efficiency benefits compared to operating with a piston
designed for CDC. In the experiments it was proved that the RCCI
piston was successful in reducing NOx and PM emissions, but the
efficiency gains were lower than expected based on the single
cylinder engine results.

4.4. Efficiency and emissions mapping of RCCI in the LD diesel
engine

Curran et al. [101] explored the efficiency, emissions and com-
bustion characteristics of RCCI with gasoline and diesel fuel over a
wide speed and load range in the LD multi-cylinder diesel engine
leading to the creation of an RCCI engine map. The RCCI map was
developed under self-imposed constraints, which included a
maximum cylinder pressure rise rate of 10 bar/deg CA and a CO
emission limit of 5000 ppm. The RCCI map was developed using a
mix of single and split diesel injections without the use of EGR for
best brake thermal efficiency with the lowest possible NOx emis-
sions. The engine used for this study was shown in Fig. 2. The
original equipment manufacturer (OEM) pistons were replaced
with pistons modified for RCCI [101], shown in Fig. 84.

For the RCCI map exploration, the maximum cylinder pressure
rise rate and CO constraints were observed during the RCCI oper-
ating procedure. RCCI operating points at intervals of 500 rev/min
and every 1 bar BMEP were explored. The engine speed and load
points explored are shown in Fig. 85, along with the constraints for
MPRR and CO. The DI injection strategy varied between a single DI
pulse at the lower engine loads and lower speeds, and a split pulse
at higher engine loads. The different injection strategies were
implemented to minimize the NOx and HC emissions tradeoffs. The
split strategy was characterized by the majority of fuel in the pilot
pulse occurring between 1.75 and 1.9 ms before the main injection,
which varied between 28 and 61 CAD before TDC. The DI injection
strategies are also shown in Fig. 84.

The contour plots presented for BTE, NOx and Soot as function
of engine load and speed shown in Fig. 86 were created using
steady-state experimental data from the multi-cylinder engine
(MCE). The maximum RCCI BTE for this map was 40.6% at

3000 rev/min, 8 bar which is 5% better than CDC operation at the
same point with BTE of 38.6%. RCCI NOx emissions were very low
over the explored RCCI operating map and are approximately an
order of magnitude less than CDC for all but the lowest engine
loads. The engine performance and emission trends also show
clear benefits and challenges for the application of RCCI on LD
diesel engine in a road application.

4.5. Use of low pressure direct injection for RCCI LD engine
operation

Walker et al. [102] used a single cylinder version of the same GM
1.9 L DI single-cylinder, four stroke diesel engine to improve effi-
ciency and emissions via in-cylinder fuel blending with low pres-
sure GDI technology and compared it against high pressure
injection RCCI experiments. The experiments were carried out to
examine the performance and emission characteristics of the base
engine under the RCCI combustion strategy. Most previous RCCI
studies used higher injection pressures greater than 500 bar with
Common Rail Injection (CRI) hardware. Considering the broad
market adoption of Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) fueling systems,
and the cost and weight of the hardware when compared to CRI
hardware, a market type GDI injector was chosen for the study.

Diesel and gasoline were used as the high reactivity and low
reactivity fuels, respectively. The low reactivity fuel gasoline (85%)
was delivered by an automotive type Port Fuel Injection (PFI) sys-
tem at (cid:4)200 (cid:2)CA aTDC during the intake stroke for the premixed
charge. The high reactivity fuel diesel (15%) was delivered using the
CRI system or the GDI system. Since the in-cylinder fuel distribu-
tions are the key factors for RCCI operation, the high reactivity fuel
injection timing, pressure, spray angle, piston geometry, type of
injector and the type of fuel play a vital role in the proper mixing of
the premixed fuel and Direct Injected fuel.

Two injectors (the CRI (for 250 bar and 500 bar) and the GDI (for
150 bar and 200 bar)) were used for delivering the high reactivity
fuel with injection sweeps from (cid:4)115 degCA aTDC to (cid:4)35 degCA
aTDC. It was found that the GDI Injector provided a broader SOI
range compared to the CRI injector. Nevertheless the CRI Injector
offered a longer achievable combustion phasing range. The overall
combustion efficiency was in the range of 90e93% and the CRI
injector provided a 1% increase in combustion efficiency over the
GDI Injector. From close observation of the results it was argued
that deposition of unburned premixed gasoline in the squish and
crevice regions of the cylinder was the major contributor to the

relatively low combustion efficiency. This was resolved by opti-
mizing the piston geometry for RCCI operation.

The modified RCCI piston had a TDC combustion chamber sur-
face area of 152.5 cm2 compared to the conventional diesel com-
bustion piston's surface area of 174.01 cm2. The reduction in piston
surface area indeed helped resolve the low combustion efficiency
issues. NOx and soot levels were found to be within the US EPA 2010
limits (0.27 g/kW-h and 0.013 g/kW-h). It was noticed that at late
injection timings only the CRI injector with 500 bar met the NOx
limit, but at the earliest injection timings both injectors met the
limits. HC was higher with the GDI injector compared to the CRI
injector. CO levels were high for the 500 bar CRI injector sweep and
the combustion stability was reduced slightly at the boundaries of
proper mixture preparation and led to incomplete combustion.

To understand the results, a CFD investigation of the in-cylinder
fuel distributions was conducted and it was found that with a given
injection pressure, a wider spray angle increased the mixing of the
direct injection fuel spray. For a given spray angle, use of a higher
injection pressure also increased the mixing of the direct injection
fuel spray. Further experiments were carried out with the opti-
mized piston geometry (TDC surface area reduction of 12.45 cm2
with the RCCI piston), wider spray angle (142(cid:2)) and the GDI low
injection pressure (150 bar) injector, which yielded a 5% (absolute)
increase in thermal efficiencies compared to the CRI injector. In the
final stage of the work, high-load RCCI engine operation was
explored with the use of low-pressure direct-injection, and at 9 bar
IMEP, equivalent performance and emissions characteristics were
seen. Gross indicated thermal efficiencies greater than 47% and
combustion efficiencies in excess of 95% were observed.

4.6. Effect of biodiesel blends on RCCI combustion in an LD multi-
cylinder diesel engine

Hanson et al. [103], performed additional experiments in the
GM 1.9 L light duty, multi-cylinder diesel engine shown in Fig. 2 to
study the effects of biofuel blends on RCCI combustion. Previous
RCCI experiments used petroleum-based fuels, such as diesel
(ULSD) and gasoline and some work was done with high percent-
age biofuels, namely E85. Hanson et al. chose E20 and B20 to
examine RCCI performance. The RCCI engine experiments were
performed using intake port fuel-injection of gasoline, E20 or E85
and direct-injection of ULSD or B20.

Hanson et al. compared the results with CDC in the 2007 model
year Opel Astra, which features the same 1.9 L engine and a manual
transmission. In order to show the impact of using E20 in place of
gasoline, the operating map results obtained from the GM 1.9 L
light duty, multi-cylinder diesel engine were compared using a
similar engine mapping exercise with gasoline and diesel fuels
[101]. The high load performance of E20 was the primary focus of
the work and hence loads below 3 bar BMEP were not extensively
studied, as was also discussed in detail by Curran et al. [101]. The
experiments were conducted following the US EPA FTP75 cycle
with E20/ULSD with the specific operating points shown in
Table 42.

Hanson et al. replaced the diesel with B20 and conducted their
experiments with gasoline as the PFI fuel and B20 as the direct
injection fuel. Also, by using E85 as the PFI fuel instead of E20, it
was possible to increase the peak load and stay within the MPRR
limits. Table 43 shows the operating conditions of G/B20 RCCI
operation (Fig. 88).

The E20/D RCCI results show that the MPRR and HRR were
reduced, which allowed for a 2 bar increase in peak load (from 8 to
10 bar BMEP), while the use of E85 (E85/B20) allowed for an
additional 1 bar increase in load (from 10 to 11 bar BMEP). An in-
crease in combustion efficiency and decrease in heat transfer and

exhaust losses was also observed. On average, the net gain in
reduced heat transfer, pumping and exhaust losses, allowed for
increased BTE, by up to 1.33% when using E20. Also, it was noticed
that the required PFI fraction decreased with E20/D operation,
which, in turn, increased NOx emissions. Increased volumetric ef-
ficiency was observed with E20, which led to lower pumping losses.
A reduced PFI-to-DI fuel amount was observed with G/B20 RCCI
operation, but unlike with the use of E20, this decreased NOx
emissions. G/B20 RCCI operation also increased combustion effi-
ciency due to reduced UHC, but had higher CO. The gain in com-
bustion efficiency helped to increase BTE by up to 1.68%. The
reduced PFI fraction in case of G/B20 operation increased the DI fuel
fraction, which increased the MPRR similarly to the E20 results.
E85/B20 RCCI operation allowed the peak BTE of RCCI to increase
from 40% to 43% compared to gasoline/diesel RCCI operation.

4.7. RCCI combustion phasing control during load transitions

The effect of transient intake manifold conditions on RCCI
engine combustion phasing control during load transitions was
studied by Wu et al. [104]. The multi-dimensional computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) code coupled with detailed chemistry, KIVA-
CHEMKIN, was applied to develop a strategy for phasing control
during load transitions. Steady-state operating points at 1500 rev/
min were calibrated from 0 to 5 BMEP. The load transitions
considered in the study included a load-up and a load-down load
change transient between 1 bar and 4 bar BMEP at 1500 rev/min.
Experimental results obtained using a fast response dynamometer
system and combustion fast response HC and NOx instrumenta-
tion showed that during the load transitions, the diesel injection
timing responded in 2 cycles, while around 5 cycles were needed
for the diesel common-rail pressure to reach the target value.
However, the intake manifold pressure lagged behind the pedal
change for about 50 cycles due to the slower response of the
turbocharger.

The effect of these transients on RCCI engine combustion
phasing was studied. Strategies for phasing control were adopted
that changed the direct port fuel injection (PFI) amount during the
load transitions. Specific engine operating cycles during the load
transitions (6 cycles for the load-up transition and 7 cycles for the
load-down transition) were selected based on the measured
change of intake manifold pressure to represent the transition
processes. Each cycle was studied separately to find the correct
PFI-to-diesel fuel ratio for the desired CA50 (the crank angle at

which 50% of total heat release occurs). The simulation results
showed that CA50 was delayed by 7e15(cid:2) for the load up transition
and advanced by around 5(cid:2) during the load-down transition if the
pre-calibrated steady-state PFI table was used. By decreasing the
PFI ratio by 10%e15% during the load-up transition and increasing
the PFI ratio by around 40% during the load-down transition, the
CA50 could be controlled at a reasonable value during transitions.
The proposed control strategy can also be used for closed-loop
control during engine transient operating conditions (Hanson
et al. [105]).

5. Conclusions and scope for future work

A review of experimental and modeling work in the field of high
efficiency, low emissions engines has been conducted. Dual fuel

reactivity controlled compression ignition combustion in HD and
LD diesel engines was focused on, due to its demonstrated superior
control, compared to other strategies with discussion of the oper-
ating range, thermal efficiency and emission benefits. Experimental
work on a single-cylinder HD diesel engine with the dual fuel
strategy and a “single fuel” strategy (with the use of an additive)
were presented, including low load to high load operation. Next,
RCCI combustion in LD and HD engines was compared and com-
bustion in an LD multi-cylinder diesel engine was discussed. Finally,
RCCI combustion in an LD single-cylinder engine was reviewed.

In each section, the effects of fuel, injection pressure, injection
timings, IVC timings, PFI fractions, piston geometry, intake tem-
perature and intake pressure on heat transfer, combustion timing,
thermal efficiency, combustion efficiency and emissions were dis-
cussed in detail. It was observed that simulation and modeling

works were extremely effective to guide the experimental studies
work in order to achieve high efficiency and high load operation.
CFD studies have been used to optimize the piston geometry for
both HD and LD RCCI applications and have yielded further
improved results. An optimized piston, which had less surface area
compared to the stock piston, that minimized heat transfer losses
and improved combustion efficiency, was described. The new pis-
ton design also helped in reducing HC emissions.

In summary, the experiments conducted using the RCCI strategy
on the HD and LD diesel engines revealed the following
achievements,

(cid:5) The studies demonstrated that RCCI is a promising strategy to
meet current and future emissions regulations without relying
on NOx and soot after-treatment.

(cid:5) Gasoline/diesel RCCI provided high thermal efficiency over a
wide range of engine loads, with a peak gross indicated effi-
ciency of 56% at a 9.3 bar IMEP operating point on an HD engine.
Operation over the load range from 2 bar IMEP to 14.6 bar IMEP
(i.e.,
load to mid-high-load operation) operation at
1300 rev/min was demonstrated.

light

(cid:5) The HD engine experiments also clearly explained the reasons
for the improved performance of RCCI combustion over con-
ventional diesel combustion. The improved efficiency was
found to be largely due to reduced heat transfer losses. Nearly
three orders of magnitude of NOx reduction, six times lower
soot, and 16.4% higher gross indicated efficiency were also
achieved using RCCI compared conventional diesel combustion
without EGR.

(cid:5) CFD modeling was used to compare RCCI and high EGR diesel
combustion. In agreement with the experiments, it was found
that at identical operating points, NOx was reduced by two or-
ders of magnitude, soot was reduced by factor of ten, and gross
indicated efficiency was improved by 11.5%.

(cid:5) RCCI experiments using a “single fuel strategy” (gasoline plus
gasoline doped with a small amount of DTBP/2-EHN) exhibited
nearly identical emissions to those obtained by the gasoline/
diesel dual-fuel strategy. The comparison of the “single fuel”
strategy with the dual
fuel strategy also revealed that a
decreased low temperature heat release magnitude decreased
compression work, and resulted in approximately a 1% gain in
gross indicated thermal efficiency.

(cid:5) RCCI experiments on the HD engine demonstrated that ~60%
gross engine efficiencies were possible through optimized
combustion management and thermodynamic conditions, and
thus provides a pathway to meet the DOE Super Truck 50% brake
thermal efficiency goal, as well as a pathway for reaching the
55% brake thermal efficiency goal. These ultra-high efficiencies
were reached by operating with a higher compression ratio
(18.7) and without piston oil cooling.

(cid:5) Natural gas/diesel RCCI operation on HD engine yielded clean,
quiet, and efficient combustion throughout the tested load and
speed range. Very low NOx and soot emissions up to 13.5 bar
IMEP load were attained without use of EGR, and with use of
EGR up to full load. Also the study suggests that different
injector configurations could allow further improvements for
RCCI operation (e.g., smaller hole diameters, and use of opti-
mized triple injections).

(cid:5) The use of natural gas as the low reactivity fuel allowed
extending the load limit and the combustion process, and
emissions results were found to be sensitive to the injection
mass split. The results showed that by equalizing the mass split
in double injections, the peak pressure rise rate and ringing
intensity were decreased substantially. Therefore, to properly
condition the squish region with diesel fuel from the first

injection while maintaining reasonable combustion noise, pre-
cise injector control is needed, especially at high load.

(cid:5) RCCI operation with E85-diesel was successful at engine loads as
high as 16.5 bar IMEPg. E85-diesel operation also enabled lower
rates of EGR use at all engine loads. The lower EGR rates were
found to be more beneficial for increasing thermal efficiency.
The maximum thermal efficiency measured with E85-diesel
fueling was 59% compared to 56% of gasoline-diesel.

(cid:5) Low emissions RCCI operation (without the need for NOx and
PM after-treatment) was successful in a production type multi-
cylinder engine utilizing the OEM diesel injection system and
turbo-machinery over the engine speed and load range typical
of light duty vehicles.

(cid:5) RCCI operation was successful with both the stock high
compression ratio OEM piston and an optimized RCCI piston.
The brake thermal efficiency of RCCI was equal to or higher than
the OEM brake thermal efficiency at three representative steady
state operating conditions studied using the optimized RCCI
piston. NOx and PM were reduced by at least one order of
magnitude compared to the OEM EURO IV calibration. However,
HC and CO were increased by one order of magnitude over the
OEM calibration indicating the need for an oxidation catalyst.
(cid:5) Use of E20 as a low reactivity fuel in the LD multi-cylinder en-
gine allowed for a 2 bar increase in the peak load from 8 to
10 bar BMEP, while the use of 85 allowed for an additional 1 bar
increase in load from 10 to 11 bar BMEP.

(cid:5) Use of B20 as the high reactivity fuel increased combustion ef-
ficiency due to reduced HC, but had higher CO. This gain in
combustion efficiency increased the brake thermal efficiency by
up to 1.68%. In addition, the use of B20 reduced the required PFI
fuel fraction. However, unlike with the use of E20, this reduced
NOx emissions. The use of E85 and B20 allowed the peak brake
thermal efficiency of RCCI with the OEM piston to be increased
from 40% with gasoline-diesel operation to 43%.

5.1. Scope for future work

The present review demonstrates that achieving high efficiency
and low NOx and soot emissions in-cylinder is possible using the
low temperature combustion RCCI strategy. From the presented
literature it is inferred that there is scope for further improvements
in RCCI, as listed below.

(cid:5) Further optimization of engine parameters is needed to fully
realize the potential of dual-fuel RCCI operation. Of paramount
interest is the feasibility of cycle-to-cycle control of dual fuel
RCCI operation over a wide range of loads and during transient
operation. The next steps in operating parameter optimizations
should include other load points.

(cid:5) The need for increased understanding of the performance of
turbo-machinery for low temperature combustion is also
apparent. The relatively low exhaust temperatures imply that
high turbocharger efficiencies will be needed.

(cid:5) Future work will help define the level of after-treatment
required for meeting LD federal-emission standards and will
need to address other design elements of interest, including the
relative sizes of the direct-injected diesel fuel tank and the PFI
fuel tank needed in a vehicle.

(cid:5) The lower exhaust temperatures with RCCI also offer challenges
for after treatment systems. Developments in oxidation catalyst
after-treatment systems are required to treat HC and CO emis-
sions at the available exhaust temperature. More research is
required in the direction of low temperature catalysts.

(cid:5) Fuel injection strategy modifications may be required. In the
current injection strategies: 70e90% of the total fuel mass was

injected in the intake port and the remaining 10% was injected
into the cylinder with the help of GDI or CRI injectors at pres-
sures of 150e800 bar. Instead, the order of blending could be
changed/optimized,
i.e., inject a certain portion of the low
reactivity fuel first, followed by the high reactivity fuel and then
inject the remaining low reactivity fuel. This could help in
controlling the combustion phasing at higher load operation,
but will require two in-cylinder direct injectors, as described by
Wissink et al. [62] and Lim and Reitz [63].

(cid:5) Choosing an inferior low reactivity fuel compared to gasoline
may also be advantageous. Experiments conducted with ethanol
as the low reactivity fuel show that it requires more high reac-
tivity fuel at high load operation. This was also utilized to extend
the load range in the LD multi-cylinder RCCI engine. Other po-
tential of low reactivity fuels could also be investigated. Simi-
larly, instead of diesel, biofuels (including neat biodiesel) could
also be used as the DI fuel.

(cid:5) More experiments are needed at higher speeds and loads to
transfer the RCCI concept toward other applications (e.g., auto-
motive/stationary).
