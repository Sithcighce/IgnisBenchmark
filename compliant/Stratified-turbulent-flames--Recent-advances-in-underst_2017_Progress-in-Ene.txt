The goals of the present review paper are; (i) to introduce experimental facilities and numerical tools
applied to investigating inhomogeneously premixed flames, (ii) to summarize recent progress in revealing
and understanding local phenomena (e.g. back-supported combustion or generation of flame surface area)
that stem from the influence of mixture inhomogeneities on flame propagation through flammable reac-
tants, (iii) to show state-of-the-art of unsteady multidimensional RANS and LES research into inhomogene-
ously premixed turbulent flames and to discuss models invoked for this purpose, and (iv) to highlight issues
that still challenge researchers who develop such models.

1. Introduction

PBecause burning of fuels is the primary technology for energy
conversion in transportation and stationary power generation world-
wide, automotive, aviation, marine, and stationary power plant
industries have a significant need for development of a new genera-
tion of highly efficient internal combustion engines capable of satisfy-
ing stringent emission requirements. Among various solutions
proposed to address this need, unconventional modes of burning of a
gaseous or liquid fuel received much attention recently and were
widely used e.g. in modern Diesel and spark ignition (SI) piston
engines or in lean premixed (LP) or lean premixed prevaporized
(LPP) combustors in gas turbines. For instance, the unconventional
modes of burning play an important role in energy conversion in the
following three types of modern engines.

P1. Low-temperature combustion (LTC) of lean fuel(cid:1)air mixtures is
considered to be a promising technological solution capable of
significantly reducing NOx emissions from gas turbines used for
propulsion and stationary power generation. To develop this
technology and to safely operate future ultra-clean aircraft and
power-generation gas turbines, the problem of thermo-acoustic
instability of LP or LPP combustors should be solved. This prob-
lem is beyond the scope of the present review paper and the
interested reader is referred to [1(cid:1)3]. For the subject of the pres-
ent paper, it is of importance that, due to rapid advection of a
fuel from a nozzle to flame-stabilization zone in a typical LP or
LPP combustor, mixing time is sufficiently short and the flame is
fed with inhomogeneous fuel(cid:1)air mixture.1 As noted by Bilger
et al. [5], even in a lean combustor, rates of fuel evaporation and
fuel(cid:1)air mixing are limited and do not allow us “to eliminate
localized fuel-rich and stoichiometric pockets left by the evapo-
ration of liquid fuel droplets”.

P2. In a conventional SI engine, fuel injected into the intake manifold
evaporates and mixes with air well before spark discharge and,
therefore, combustion occurs in the premixed mode, i.e. burning
rate is controlled by propagation of a flame through the homoge-
neous mixture of the fuel and air. On the contrary, direct injec-
tion (DI) of a liquid fuel into the combustion chamber of an SI
engine is considered to be a promising technological solution
aimed at decreasing fuel consumption and improving efficiency
[6(cid:1)8]. In such a DI SI engine, the time interval between injection
of a fuel into the engine cylinder and subsequent spark discharge
may be too short for the mixture composition to be homoge-
neous at the spark-discharge instant. While the mixture compo-
sition averaged over the cylinder volume is often lean (and may
even be beyond the lean flammability limit), the mixture is
locally rich in the vicinity of the spark electrodes at the spark-
discharge instant. Accordingly, a flame kernel created by the
spark propagates through a highly inhomogeneous mixture and

1 In particular, thermo-acoustic oscillations may be caused by variations in the mix-

ture composition [4].

Pis subject to significant spatial and temporal variations in the
local mixture composition. Moreover, because the local mixture
composition may be well beyond the rich or lean flammability
limit in some volumes for a sufficiently long time, an amount of
the fuel may be consumed in the non-premixed mode after the
flame kernel envelopes locally flammable volumes. Furthermore,
products of incomplete combustion of locally rich volumes mix
with excess oxygen coming from locally lean products and are
also consumed in the non-premixed mode.

P3. While conventional Diesel engines operate in the non-premixed
combustion mode (i.e. burning rate is controlled by mixing of a
fuel and air, which are separated in the largest part of the engine
cylinder), modern Diesel engines can also operate in a partially
premixed mode [9]. The point is that exhaust-gas re-circulation
(EGR), which is widely used to significantly reduce NOx emis-
sions by burning a fuel under low-temperature conditions at
low engine loads, increases ignition delay time, thus, allowing
the evaporized fuel to partially mix with air in a zone of the
combustion chamber of the engine.

PThus, in a modern gas turbine combustor or piston engine, locally
lean, stoichiometric, and rich reaction zones can be observed in dif-
ferent parts of the combustion chamber at the same instant. Accord-
ingly, both inhomogeneously premixed and non-premixed modes of
burning may simultaneously contribute to the total heat release,
with the contribution from the former (or latter) mode dominating
e.g. in DI SI (or Diesel) engines, respectively. Following Bilger et al.
[5], such a subregime of partially premixed combustion may be
called “premixed/non-premixed” burning. A lifted jet flame [10,11],
i.e. a flame stabilized at certain distance from a nozzle when a fuel
(or a very rich mixture) jets from the nozzle into surrounding quies-
cent air, is a well-known simple test case for investigating pre-
mixed/non-premixed turbulent burning. Triple flames [12,13], i.e.
burning in the mixing layer of rich and lean fuel(cid:1)air streams and
edge flames [14] are other well-known simple test cases.

PIn a general case, premixed/non-premixed burning may be con-
sidered to be a superposition of two subregimes; non-premixed
combustion and propagation of a premixed flame through inhomo-
geneous2 reactants. The scope of the present paper is solely
restricted to discussing the latter subregime, i.e. inhomogeneously
premixed or stratified burning.

PIt is worth noting that term “stratified burning” may have differ-
ent sense in the literature. In a wide sense, this term is used in the
SI-engine literature and assumes the entire combustion process in a
DI SI engine, i.e. both flame propagation through inhomogeneously
premixed reactants and mixing-controlled after burning of lean and
rich products. In a narrow sense, the term “stratified burning” was
introduced by Bilger et al. [5] in order to refer to combustion of

2 Henceforth, words “homogeneous” and “inhomogeneous” refer to mixture com-
position, rather than flow field. Moreover, if the opposite is not stated, terms “inho-
mogeneous reactants” and “inhomogeneous fuel(cid:1)air mixture” also mean that the
composition of the reactants or the mixture, respectively, is within the flammability
limits.

Peither solely lean or solely rich inhomogeneous reactants under con-
ditions of vanishing probability of finding stoichiometric mixture. In
the present paper, the term is used in a medium sense, i.e. following
Masri [15], stratified burning is considered to be propagation of a
flame “through a range of compositions within the flammable lim-
its”. In other words, terms “stratified burning” and “inhomogene-
ously premixed burning” will be equivalent in the following.

PPremixed/non-premixed burning (i.e. mixture composition is
inhomogeneous, is inflammable in some regions, but is flammable in
other regions) is always accompanied by inhomogeneously premixed
or stratified burning (i.e. mixture composition is inhomogeneous and
is within the flammability limits everywhere), which occurs in
regions of the premixed/non-premixed flame that are characterized
by locally flammable mixture composition. On the contrary, the strati-
fied burning can occur independently of the premixed/non-premixed
burning. For instance, the purely stratified flames can be studied in
laboratory experiments, as will be discussed later. Combustion in
modern engines is premixed/non-premixed, with inhomogeneously
premixed burning playing either a major (DI SI engines and LPP com-
bustors) or a minor (Diesel engines) role. Accordingly, Reynolds-aver-
aged Navier(cid:1)Stokes (RANS) and large eddy simulation (LES) studies
of premixed/non-premixed burning in such engines should always
invoke a model of inhomogeneously premixed flames in addition to a
model of mixing-controlled combustion. For these reasons, numerical
research into premixed/non-premixed burning will be addressed in
the following, but the focus of discussion will be placed on phenom-
ena associated with the inhomogeneously premixed flames.

PIt is also worth noting that partially premixed combustion is not
reduced to premixed/non-premixed and stratified burning modes.
For instance, combustion in a mixing layer of two inflammable (very
lean and very rich) jets is partially premixed, but differs from both
premixed/non-premixed and stratified burning modes. In the rest of
the present paper, partially premixed flames will be mentioned
when discussing points relevant to all types of such flames.

PBecause the stratified burning plays a role not only in LP or LPP
combustors and DI SI engines, but also in modern Diesel engines, the
paper contents could be of interest for students, researchers, and
engineers who deal with all these combustion technologies. While
the contribution of this burning mode to the total Heat Release Rate
(HRR) may be considered to be of secondary importance in Diesel
engines, the stratified burning mainly controls total heat release in
LP or LPP combustors and DI SI engines. However, it is worth stress-
ing again that the non-premixed mode of turbulent burning also
plays a role in such combustors and engines (e.g. it controls soot
emissions from DI SI engines), but the latter mode is beyond the
scope of the present review article. Therefore, the paper should not
be considered to be a complete introduction in premixed/non-
premixed flames in LPP combustors and DI SI engines.

PThe restriction of the paper scope to the stratified mode of
premixed/non-premixed burning stems from a fact that recent
advances in understanding the non-premixed mode of premixed/
non-premixed burning were already discussed in detail in a couple
of papers that reviewed results of investigations of simple test cases
such as lifted jet [10,11], triple [13], and edge [14] flames, as well as

Pextinction of them [16]. On the contrary, important peculiarities of
premixed flame propagation through inhomogeneous reactants,
revealed in recent experimental and numerical studies, have yet
been addressed briefly in a single review paper [15] and definitely
deserve further discussion. Accordingly, the focus of the present
paper is placed on (i) recently revealed basically new effects specific
to flame propagation through inhomogeneous reactants and (ii)
modeling challenges that stem from these effects. On the contrary,
an extensive review of applied research into flame propagation
through inhomogeneous reactants is beyond the major scope of the
paper. In particular, while a number of RANS and LES studies of pre-
mixed/non-premixed turbulent flames, which in particular involved
the inhomogeneously premixed burning mode, were performed
over the past decade, a small part of such studies will be discussed
in order to (i) demonstrate mainstream approaches to allowing for
certain effects that stem from the mixture inhomogeneity and (ii) to
highlight other basic effects that should be taken into account by
future high-fidelity models of inhomogeneously premixed turbulent
combustion. The reader interested in Computational Fluid Dynamics
(CFD) applications of various available models of stratified turbulent
flames is referred to other papers. For instance, LES studies of pre-
mixed/non-premixed turbulent flames associated with combustion
in gas turbines were recently reviewed by Gicquel et al. [17]. who
cited as many as 410 contributions.

PThe present paper aims at discussing basic peculiarities of flame
propagation through inhomogeneously mixed reactants when com-
pared to a reference case of flame propagation through a homoge-
neous fuel(cid:1)air mixture, with detailed discussion of the reference case
being beyond the scope of the present article. Accordingly, the reader
interested in fundamentals of the homogeneously premixed3 and
non-premixed turbulent combustion is referred to textbooks [18(cid:1)24],
series of review chapters [25(cid:1)28], and review papers [29(cid:1)78].

PNevertheless, because mathematical background and nomencla-
ture used in studies of stratified flames are strongly based on the
mathematical background and nomenclature developed by investigat-
ing premixed and non-premixed burning, it is worth beginning the
present review article with a short introduction in the latter mathe-
matical background and nomenclature. Such an introduction is given
in Section 2. Experimental facilities and numerical simulations that
were applied to reveal basic peculiarities of stratified combustion are
reviewed in Section 3. Subsequently, these peculiarities are discussed
in detail in Section 4 and modeling challenges that stem from such
recent findings are emphasized in Section 5, followed by conclusions.

2. Mathematical background

PA general set of transport equations that model reacting flows is
discussed in detail elsewhere [19]. Here, we will restrict ourselves to
a less general set of equations that is commonly used to model com-
bustion of gases. The latter may be obtained from the former by
assuming that [26]

and Fourier’s laws, respectively.

where p, r, and T are the pressure, density, and temperature,
respectively, M is the molecular weight of the mixture, and Ro is
the universal gas constant.

homogeneously premixed turbulent combustion.

PSuch a research method is known as Direct Numerical Simulation
(DNS).

t

PDNS is a very expensive numerical tool and its applications
are mainly limited to simple model problems. Even in a constant-
density non-reacting case, the size of numerical mesh required for
performing 3D DNS of a turbulent flow scales as Re3
t [82], because
(i) a ratio of length scales of the largest and smallest eddies in such a
flow is on the order of Re3=4
and (ii) time step Dt in such simulations
is typically proportional to the mesh step Dx / Re3=4
. Therefore, a
DNS of a flow characterized by a really high turbulent Reynolds
number Ret 1⁄4 u0L=n is still a very challenging task. Nevertheless,
Reynolds numbers as large Reλ (cid:4) 1300 were reached in a recent
DNS study using a mesh of 81923 (i.e. 239) nodes [83]. Here, u0 and L
designate rms velocity and an integral length scale of turbulence,
respectively, Reλ 1⁄4 u0λ=n / Re1=2
; and the Taylor microscale λ is

on the order of
in homogeneous isotropic turbulence
[82,84,85].

PIn the case of combustion, the main challenge consists not only
of a significant increase in a number of transport equations to be
solved, but also in an extension of the range of spatial scales to be
resolved. Accordingly, the majority of contemporary DNS studies
of turbulent flames deal with moderate Ret (typically, well below
1000) and with comparable values of L and laminar flame thick-
ness in order for ranges of spatial scales associated with combus-
tion and turbulence to well overlap. Examples of advanced DNS
studies of premixed turbulent flames can be found in recent
papers [86(cid:1)92], with DNS of laboratory flames becoming possible
[93(cid:1)99]. Nevertheless, 3D, complex-chemistry (i.e. N (cid:5) 1) DNS
of turbulent flames characterized by a large (when compared
to the laminar flame thickness) length scale L and, hence, by
Ret 1⁄4 Oð1000Þ or higher is still an unfeasible task. Accordingly,
such flames are numerically modeled invoking simplified
approaches that are discussed below.

PA temperature transport equation can be obtained by substitut-

ing Eq. (7) into Eq. (5) and using Eq. (8).

PEqs. (1)(cid:1)(8) supplemented with expressions for the rates _vm
(e.g. see Ref. [19]) can be solved numerically to simulate a laminar
flame and such a research method is routinely used today, with
a number of advanced software packages being available on the
market.

PIf Eqs. (1)(cid:1)(8) are numerically integrated to study a turbulent
flow, such computations should be performed using a fine mesh that
allows to resolve both the smallest turbulent eddies and rapid spa-
tial variations of intermediate species within thin reaction zones.

PThe most affordable approach to modeling turbulent flames by
using the unsteady 3D transport Eqs. (2), (3), (5), and (8) deals with
mean flame characteristics such as r; e
h; p; eu; etc., which are
Y k
determined by averaging fields q(x, t) over time (e.g. in a statistically
stationary case), spatial regions (e.g. planes parallel to the mean
flame surface in a statistically 1D case), or an ensemble of statisti-
cally equivalent events [82,84,85]. Such a technique is known as
RANS approach.

PWhen invoking the RANS approach to modeling turbulent
combustion, transport equations are commonly averaged using
the so-called Favre method, i.e. a quantity q is decomposed into
its mass-weighted mean eq (cid:6) rq=r and fluctuation q00 (cid:6) q(cid:1)eq;
where overbars denote the standard Reynolds average, i.e. q. Such
a method yields transport equations with a smaller number of

mean rate of production (or consumption) of m-species, respec-
tively. The molecular transport term B is typically much less than
term A and, therefore, is often neglected.

PThe major challenge of turbulent combustion consists in averag-
ing reaction rates that depend on the local temperature T in a highly
non-linear manner, with T exhibiting strong fluctuations in a turbu-
lent flame. The reader interested in various approaches suggested to
resolve this problem in cases of premixed or non-premixed combus-
tion is referred to the literature listed in the beginning of Section 1,
in particular to [5,22(cid:1)28,44,59,63,66]. The contents of the present
paper will mainly be restricted to new challenges associated with
mixture stratification, see Section 5.

PModeling of other aforementioned unclosed terms is also a diffi-
cult task, as reviewed elsewhere [54,65,78]. For instance, while
the following gradient-diffusion closure

is widely used in RANS simulations of turbulent burning via an anal-
ogy with turbulent mixing in constant-density non-reacting flows
[82,84,85], the scalar product of vectors ru00 Y 00
Y may be posi-
tive in flames, thus, implying a negative turbulent diffusivity Dt. Such
a phenomenon known as countergradient transport was theoretically
predicted [100,101] and experimentally found [102,103] in premixed
flames almost 40 years ago and was well documented in various
experimental and DNS investigations of turbulent combustion, e.g.
see a recent review article [65] that addresses the premixed mode of
burning. In the present paper, this phenomenon is not discussed,
because (i) almost all RANS or LES studies of the stratified turbulent
flames were so far performed invoking Eq. (14) or its filtered counter-
part, respectively, and (ii) the present author is not aware on a
basically new effect that stems from interaction between the counter-
gradient transport and mixture inhomogeneities in the case of the
stratified burning. The latter claim does not mean that such new
effects cannot exist. The claim means solely that such new effects
have not yet been observed. Accordingly, the reader interested in
physical mechanisms and models of the countergradient transport is
referred to recent articles [65,78] where results of investigations of
premixed turbulent flames are reviewed.

PAnother effect that plays a very important role in premixed tur-
bulent combustion, but is beyond the scope of the present paper,
consists of the well-documented [64] strong dependence of mean
burning rate on differences between molecular diffusivities of fuel
and oxygen and the molecular heat diffusivity of the mixture. Such
preferential diffusion and Lewis number effects will not be discussed
in the following for the same two reasons; (i) almost all RANS or LES
studies of the stratified turbulent flames were so far performed by

Pneglecting these effects, and (ii) the present author is not aware on a
basically new phenomenon that stems from interaction between
mixture inhomogeneities and the aforementioned differences in
molecular transport coefficients in the case of the stratified turbu-
lent burning. Accordingly, the reader interested in manifestations,
physical mechanisms, and models of the preferential diffusion and
Lewis number effects is referred to a recent book [24] and an article
[64] where results of investigations of premixed turbulent flames
are reviewed. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that, because differen-
ces in molecular transport coefficients of various species play
a substantial role in the stratified flames, as will be discussed in
Section 4.1, the preferential diffusion and Lewis number effects in
such flames appear to be important subjects for future research.

2.3. Filtered transport equations for LES

PToday, RANS computations are often claimed to be inferior to LES,
because the latter numerical technique offers an opportunity to
straightforwardly resolve eddies of large and medium scales and
requires solely modeling of small-scale processes, which are com-
monly considered to be more universal and less sensitive to bound-
ary conditions. Nevertheless, it is worth remembering that, because
the most heat is released in thin reaction zones in a typical premixed
turbulent flame [24,74], the most important effects associated with
flame(cid:1)turbulence interaction are small-scale effects, which are not
resolved and require modeling even in LES [104]. Accordingly, as
far as LES of turbulent burning is concerned, the vast majority of
available combustion models stem straightforwardly from their
RANS predecessors, i.e. a typical LES model of that kind invokes
equations developed for RANS applications, but substitutes mean
e
T; with the counterpart filtered quantities, e.g.
quantities, e.g. r and
(cid:2)
br and
T ; respectively. However, such LES combustion models have
not yet contributed4 significantly to better understanding of flame(cid:1)
turbulence interaction at small scales when compared to the RANS
predecessors. For this reason, the RANS models will be discussed in
more detail in the rest of the present paper whose focus is placed on
basic issues associated with flame(cid:1)turbulence interaction. Never-
theless, it is worth remembering that LES approach has a potential
to significantly improve predictions of phenomena controlled by
resolved large-scale eddies, e.g. development of turbulent diffusivity
in a premixed flame [24,63], large-scale fluctuations of the mixture
composition in a non-premixed or stratified flame, thermo-acoustic
instabilities [3], etc. Moreover, there are a few models of flame(cid:1)tur-
bulence interaction that were specifically designed for LES and such
models will be addressed in Section 5.

PTo conclude this brief introduction in LES background, it is worth

noting that a typical LES deals with transport equations for filtered

domain. In order to resolve large-scale phenomena, the filter func-
tion P(r, t) should be localized either in the physical or in the wave-
number space, with the filter size D being much smaller than the
integral turbulence length scales. The so-called box filter PðrÞ 1⁄4 D(cid:1)1
Hð0:5D(cid:1)jrjÞ and the sharp spectral filter PðrÞ 1⁄4 sinðpr=DÞ=ðprÞ
are 1D examples of the two types of filters, respectively [82]. Here,

a filter function P(r, t), followed by integration over r, yields

evaluate model parameters following ideas by Germano et al. [105,106].

Janicka and Sadiki [68] and by Pitsch [70], as well as to a profound
discussion of certain important issues by Pope [104]. Applications of
LES to applied combustion research were recently reviewed e.g. by
Poinsot [3], Masri [15], Gicquel et al. [17], and Rutland [107].

2.4. Single-scalar models of premixed and non-premixed turbulent
combustion

PIn addition to considering mean or filtered quantities, another
important simplification widely invoked to model non-premixed or
premixed turbulent combustion consists in describing the state of
reacting mixture with a single scalar variable, thus, strongly reduc-
ing the number of transport equations to be solved. In order for such
a simplification to be fully justified, (i) combustion chemistry should
be reduced to a single irreversible reaction
YF þ StYO ! YP;

(ii) burning should be adiabatic and non-premixed or premixed, (iii)
diffusivities Dm should be equal to the same D for the fuel and oxy-
gen, and, moreover, (iv) the Lewis number Le 1⁄4 a=D should be equal
to unity. Nevertheless, models developed within the framework of
the single-scalar paradigm of non-premixed or premixed combus-
tion are widely applied to analyzing data obtained from laboratory
complex-chemistry flames, which are neither adiabatic nor equidif-
fusive. Thus, even if the focus of contemporary CFD research into tur-
bulent combustion is shifted to the use of complex chemistry,5 e.g.
see Table 6 in Section 5, consideration of the simplified single-scalar
paradigm is necessary, because a large amount of experimental data
were reported and discussed in terms that pertained to such a para-
digm. Moreover, it is a valuable research tool for revealing basic
physical mechanisms of flame(cid:1)turbulence interaction. Furthermore,
even in RANS and LES studies that allow for complex combustion
chemistry, the chemistry is often addressed by tabulating results
pre-computed by simulating simple laminar flames, with the mix-
ture composition being characterized with either a single or two
scalar variables in such tables. The use of a flamelet library [22,33]
discussed in the next subsection is an example of such an approach.

P2.4.1. Non-premixed flames

PIn a non-premixed flame, the mixture state is often characterized

with a single mixture fraction Z, which may be defined as follows

Z 1⁄4

StðYF (cid:1)YF;1Þ(cid:1)YO þ YO;1
StðYF;2 (cid:1)YF;1Þ(cid:1)YO;2 þ YO;1

ð17Þ

in the case of burning of two streams 1 and 2. Here, St is the mass
stoichiometric coefficient, subscripts F and O designate the fuel and
oxygen, respectively. Eq. (17) yields Z1 1⁄4 0 and Z2 1⁄4 1.

PIf combustion chemistry is reduced to a single irreversible reac-
tion and molecular diffusivities of the fuel and oxygen are assumed
to be equal to the same D, then, the transport equation for the mix-
ture fraction reads [29,33]

in RANS framework. Thus, the use of the mixture fraction offers an
opportunity to significantly simplify modeling of flame(cid:1)turbulence
interaction by circumventing a problem of averaging highly non-
linear function _vmðTÞ. It is worth noting that, under invoked simplifi-
cations (qR 1⁄4 0 and Scm 1⁄4 Pr), the field of the normalized enthalpy
ðh(cid:1)h1Þ=ðh2 (cid:1)h1Þ is also modeled by Eq. (18) with the same boundary
e
conditions of Z1 1⁄4 0 and Z2 1⁄4 1. Therefore, the enthalpy h or
h is
known if the mixture fraction Z or

e
Z; respectively, is known.

PIn order to determine the mean density, temperature, and mix-
e
Zðx; tÞ to Eq. (19), one of the
ture composition using a solution
following two methods is often used. The simplest one is based on
an assumption that burning rate is controlled by mixing, because the
reaction rate is very high in the vicinity of the stoichiometric surface,
where StYF 1⁄4 YO and Zðx; tÞ 1⁄4 Zst. Due to Eq. (17), the stoichiometric
value of the mixture fraction is as follows

Zst 1⁄4

1
1 þ ðStYF;2 (cid:1)YO;2Þ=ðYO;1 (cid:1)StYF;1Þ

:

ð20Þ

If the reaction rate is considered to be infinitely fast at Zðx; tÞ 1⁄4 Zst;
then, the knowledge of Z allows us to find the local density, tempera-
ture, and mixture composition. Indeed, if Z < Zst, then, the mixture is
locally lean and consists of the stoichiometric combustion products
mixed with the air. If Z > Zst, the mixture is locally rich and consists
of the stoichiometric combustion products mixed with the fuel.

PA more advanced method is based on invoking a flamelet library
[22,33], i.e. a set of dependencies of Ym(Z, xZ,st) and T(Z, xZ,st), pre-
computed by simulating laminar diffusion flames subject to various
scalar dissipation rates
xZ 1⁄4 D r Z ¢ r Z
ð21Þ
evaluated at the stoichiometric surface Zðx; tÞ 1⁄4 Zst. Such simulations
can be performed by solving N (cid:5) 1 Eqs. (8) and invoking a suffi-
ciently detailed chemical mechanism.

e
Y m and

PBoth approaches yield dependencies of local Ym and T on the local
Z. To average such dependencies and to allow for the influence of
e
fluctuations in Z on the mean values of
T; the so-called pre-
sumed Probability Density Function (pPDF) approach pioneered
by Janicka and Kollmann [108] is commonly used. The approach
consists in invoking a canonical PZð&; y; ZÞ or mass-weighted
e
PZð&; y; ZÞ 1⁄4 rðZÞPZð&; y; ZÞ=r Probability Density Function (PDF),
which involves two parameters & and ythat control the PDF shape.

P2.4.2. Premixed flames

PIn the case of single-step chemistry and adiabatic, premixed, and
equidiffusive (Lem 1⁄4 Pr=Scm 1⁄4 1 for all reactants) burning, the state
of the mixture may be described using a single combustion progress
variable c, which is commonly defined as follows

and, therefore, is equal to zero and unity in fresh reactants and
equilibrium combustion products, respectively. Here, subscripts
u and b designate unburned and burned gas, respectively, and Y
is the mass fraction of fuel or oxygen in the case of lean or rich
(5)(cid:1)(8)
respectively. Under such assumptions, Eqs.

where the mass rate _vc of product creation depends on c in a highly

molecular weight of the mixture are commonly neglected when
evaluating the temperature within a turbulent flame so that Eq. (1)
reduces to
rT 1⁄4 ruTu:

PEqs. (29)(cid:1)(33) hold both in a premixed flame and in a non-pre-
mixed flame. However,
in the latter case, the mixture-fraction
approach is commonly used, because the problem of averaging the
highly non-linear function _vcðcÞ can be circumvented by character-
izing the mixture state with Z, which varies in space and time. On
the contrary, the mixture-fraction approach is useless in the case of
premixed burning. Indeed, because the field of Z is spatially uniform
and steady in a premixed flame, the mixture fraction cannot describe
the location or motion of the flame. Accordingly, in the rest of the
present subsection, application of Eqs. (29)(cid:1)(33) to modeling pre-
mixed combustion is discussed.

Tðx; tÞ; e

PSimilar to the case of non-premixed burning, discussed earlier,
the knowledge of the mean field ecðx; tÞ in a premixed turbulent
flame is not sufficient to precisely calculate other mean fields such
as erðx; tÞ; e
Y mðx; tÞ in the flame even if local dependencies
of r(c), T(c), and Ym(c) are known. The point is that fluctuations in c
make f ðcÞ different from f ðcÞ for any non-linear function f(c) such
as r(c), T(c), etc. In the case of the non-premixed burning, a similar
problem is resolved either by considering a PDF transport equation
Z; rZ00 2 =rÞ; as discussed

e
PZðZ; e

[21,42(cid:1)44,75] or by invoking a pPDF
earlier.

PAs far as the former approach is concerned, the major challenge
consists of the following. A term that describes molecular mixing
plays an important role in a PDF transport equation, but requires
modeling. While certain relevant models were well validated
against experimental data obtained from non-premixed flames
[21,42(cid:1)44,75], such models seem to require more validation against
experimental data obtained from premixed flames, even if encourag-
ing results were recently reported [109]. Moreover, the present
author is aware on a single application of this approach to simula-
tions of stratified turbulent flames [110]. For these reasons and
because evaluation of the mean density or reaction rate is straight-
forward if the relevant PDF is found by solving a transport equation,
further discussion of models that deal with PDF transport equations
is beyond the scope of the present article and the reader interested
in this approach is referred to book [21] and review papers
[42(cid:1)44,75].

e
Pcðc; ec; rc00 2 =rÞ were invoked to evaluate _vc in premixed tur-
various
bulent flames in recent papers, e.g. see Refs. [113(cid:1)124].

t

PIn the case of premixed combustion, there is one more widely
e
Pcðc; ecÞ. The approach has clear physical
used approach to modeling
meaning and clear limitations. It addresses propagation of a pre-
mixed flame in large-scale weak turbulence characterized by a high
Damk€ohler number Da 1⁄4 tt=tc (cid:5) 1 and a low Karlovitz number
Ka 1⁄4 ðdL=hÞ2 / Re1=2
=Da (cid:7) 1. Here, tt 1⁄4 L=u0 and tc 1⁄4 dL=SL 1⁄4 Du=S2
L
are turbulent and laminar flame time scales, respectively, dL 1⁄4 Du=SL
and SL are the laminar flame thickness and speed, respectively, h / L
Re(cid:1)3=4
is the Kolmogorov length scale, i.e. the length scale of the
smallest turbulent eddies. Under such conditions, the influence of
turbulence on combustion consists mainly in wrinkling thin (dL < h)
inherently laminar burning zones [22(cid:1)26], which are often assumed
to have the same local structure as a stretched laminar flame and,
accordingly, are called flamelets [34]. Turbulent eddies move flame-
lets within a thick zone called turbulent flame brush, with the mean
flame brush thickness dt being much larger than dL.

t

PWithin the framework of such a flamelet paradigm, substantial
simplifications may be accepted when investigating the influence of
turbulence on premixed combustion. First, the mean mass rate of
product creation may be modeled as follows [23,66]
_vc 1⁄4 ruucS;
ð42Þ
where S 1⁄4 j r cj is the mean Flame Surface Density (FSD), i.e. the
mean area of flamelet surface per unit volume, ruuc is the mean
mass rate of product creation per unit area of flamelet surface, and
the mean consumption velocity uc is often assumed to be equal to
the unperturbed laminar flame speed SL, u with respect to fresh reac-
tants. In LES studies of premixed turbulent flames, a closure relation
similar to Eq. (42) is widely invoked for filtered quantities, with the
filtered FSD being evaluated as follows
bS 1⁄4ξj r (cid:2)cj:
ð43Þ
Here, a wrinkling factor ξ allows for contribution of unresolved (sub-
grid) scales to production of flamelet surface area and requires
modeling. In subsequent sections, we will see that quantities S; uc;
bS; and ξ, as well as flamelet curvature
k 1⁄4 r ¢ n;

ð44Þ

where

n 1⁄4 (cid:1)

r c
j r cj

ð45Þ

is the unit vector locally normal to flamelet surface, are also used to
characterize turbulent stratified burning.

PSecond, within the framework of the flamelet paradigm, the
probability g(x, t) of finding intermediate states (i.e. 0 < c < 1) of
the mixture may be hypothesized to be low, because such states are
localized to thin (dL (cid:7) dt) zones. Consequently, the conventional PDF
Pc(c) can be modeled as follows
Pcðc; x; tÞ 1⁄4 aðx; tÞdðcÞ þ bðx; tÞdð1(cid:1)cÞ þ gðx; tÞPc;f ðc; x; tÞ;

ð46Þ

where a(x, t) and b(x, t) are the probabilities of finding the
unburned and burned mixture, respectively, in point x at instant

Pt, and Pc,f(c, x, t) is the contribution from flamelets to the PDF
Pc(c, x, t). In the following, dependencies of P, a, b, g, etc. on t
and x will not be specified for the sake of brevity.

PTo the best of the author’s knowledge, the first model of pre-
mixed turbulent combustion that invoked such a PDF was put for-
ward by Prudnikov [125(cid:1)127] in the sixties. Subsequently, the
approach was substantially developed by Bray, Moss, and Libby
[128(cid:1)132]. Accordingly, it is called BML approach today.

PUsing Eq. (46), one can easily show that

q 1⁄4 aqu þ bqb þ OðgÞ
ð47Þ
for any bounded quantity q, provided that qu, qb, and q(0 < c < 1)
are of the same order of magnitude.6 In the following, asymptotically
(g ! 0) small terms O(g) will not be specified for the sake of
brevity. Application of Eq. (47) to q 1⁄4 1 and q 1⁄4 c results in b 1⁄4 c
and a 1⁄4 1(cid:1)c; because cu 1⁄4 0 and cb 1⁄4 1. Therefore, the Reynolds-
averaged combustion progress variable is equal to the probability of
finding combustion products. Subsequently, application of Eq. (47)
to q 1⁄4 rc and q 1⁄4 rð1(cid:1)cÞ results in brb 1⁄4 rec and aru 1⁄4 rð1(cid:1)ecÞ;
respectively. Therefore,

;

eq 1⁄4 ð1(cid:1)ecÞqu þ ecqb
q 1⁄4 ð1(cid:1)cÞqu þ cqb
for quantities q such as r, T, Ym, etc. In particular,
r 1⁄4 ð1(cid:1)cÞru þ crb 1⁄4 ru (cid:1)ðs (cid:1)1Þrec
and, hence,

ð48Þ

ð49Þ

;

r 1⁄4

ru
1 þ tec
=rb is the density ratio and t 1⁄4 s (cid:1)1 is a heat-release
where s 1⁄4 ru
factor. Thus, the BML approach yields the first order (with respect to
g (cid:7) 1) solution to the problem of averaging density, temperature,
and mass-fraction fields.

ð50Þ

PStrictly speaking, the BML approach deals with a pPDF. However,
e
Pcðc; ec; rc00 2 =rÞ; which is commonly set
contrary to a presumed PDF
based on reasoning of numerical efficiency and simplicity, e.g. see
e
Pcðc; ecÞ is based on a clear
the aforementioned beta PDF, the BML PDF
physical hypothesis of g (cid:7) 1. From this perspective, the BML PDF
e
Pcðc; ec; rc00 2 =rÞ whose shape is

seems to be superior to a fully pPDF
arbitrarily selected.7

POn the contrary, other features of the pPDF might be claimed to
e
Pcðc; ecÞ involves
make it superior to the BML PDF. First, the BML PDF
e
a single parameter ec; whereas the shape of a pPDF
Pcðc; ec; rc00 2 =rÞ
is controlled by two parameters, i.e. ec and rc00 2 =r. At first glance, this
feature of the latter PDF is an advantage, because the use of an extra
parameter offers an opportunity to extend the model capabilities.
Second, a pPDF allows us to easily average the rate _vc; see Eq. (41),
_vc
whereas the BML PDF does not yield a closure relation for
unless term gPc,f (c) in Eq. (46) is modeled. However, these two
e
Pcðc; ec; rc00 2 =rÞ should not be
apparent advantages of a pPDF
overestimated for the reasons discussed in Section 5.1.2.

PWhen g is increased and the segregation factor egc is decreased,
the basic assumption of the BML paradigm ceases to be valid8. Nev-
ertheless, because a dependence of r(c) is weakly non-linear when
compared to _vcðcÞ; the mean density may be evaluated using the
mean value of the combustion progress variable, i.e. rðcÞ (cid:4) rðcÞ; if
the segregation factor egc is significantly less than unity. Accordingly,

6 Because such a constraint does not hold for the rate _vc; pressure gradient rp, and
dilatation r ¢ u, which vanish both in unburned and burned gases, the BML PDF Pc
does not help us to average these quantities. In particular, the BML PDF Pc does not
yield a closure relation for the mean rate _vc.

7 In the rest of the present paper, word “fully” will be skipped when discussing such
a PDF, whereas word “presumed” will be skipped when discussing the BML PDF given
by Eq. (46) with unknown g (cid:7) 1.

8 A recent DNS study [133] shows that various BML expressions hold at least at

egc 1⁄4 0:8.

accuracy seems to be at least consistent with the accuracy of
_vc in premixed turbulent flames.
the most advanced models of
The matching function F may simply be proportional to egc and vari-
ous closure relations for the segregation factor are discussed else-
where [134,135]. Alternatively, F may be a function of Ka or Da, e.g.
F 1⁄4 expð(cid:1)KaÞ or F 1⁄4 1(cid:1) expð(cid:1)DaÞ.

PFinally, it is worth noting that the BML approach appears to be
sufficiently accurate for the most important branch of applications
of models of stratified turbulent flames, i.e. numerical simulations
of burning in a DI SI engine. Indeed, compression of a mixture in a
cylinder of a SI engine results in increasing SL, but decreasing dL.
For instance, approximations by Metghalchi and Keck [136] and
by G€ulder [137], which are widely used in CFD research into
burning in piston engines, yield SL 1⁄4 1:2 and 1.0 m/s, respectively,
for the stoichiometric iso-octane/air mixture at
temperature
Tu 1⁄4 750 K and pressure p 1⁄4 1:5 MPa. More recent correlations by
M€uller et al. [138], Marshall et al. [139], and Galmiche et al. [140]
yield SL 1⁄4 1:0; 1.0, and 0.9 m/s, respectively, under the same condi-
tions. These values are comparable with the values of u0 1⁄4 1(cid:1)2 m/s
measured in research piston engines at instants associated with
combustion phase, e.g. see Fig. 11 in [141] or Fig. 13 in [142]. More-
over, the laminar flame thickness dL 1⁄4 Du=SL estimated under
the same conditions is significantly smaller than dL at room condi-
tions. Indeed, both Du and SL depend similarly on Tu, but a decrease
in Du / p(cid:1)1 with increasing p overwhelms a weak decrease in
SL / p(cid:1)q; because q is close to 0.25 for heavy paraffins. Therefore,
Da (or Ka) is expected to be substantially larger (smaller) than
unity under conditions associated with burning in SI engines, thus,
justifying application of the BML paradigm to combustion in such
engines.

2.5. Two-scalar approach to modeling stratified turbulent combustion

PBased on the above discussion, one may suggest that the simplest
approach to modeling inhomogeneously premixed turbulent com-
bustion consists in characterizing the state of a mixture in a strati-
fied flame with two scalar variables, mixture fraction Z and a
combustion progress variable c. However, even such a “simplest”
approach faces at least two new fundamental challenges specific to
stratified burning.

POne challenge consists of the following. Even if the mean
e
Zðx; tÞ and ecðx; tÞ are known, one cannot average the
fields of
density, temperature, etc. by invoking a single PDF PZ(Z) as in
the non-premixed case or a single PDF Pc(c) as in the premixed
case. A joint PDF P(Z, c) should be employed for these purposes.
Then, a simplest assumption consists in substituting this joint
PDF with a product of two independent PDFs, but this simplifica-
tion does not have a fundamental justification. For instance, if
e
PðZ; cÞ is modeled by invoking a product
the mass-weighted PDF

ent author is not aware on a solid argument that explains why the

then,

and combustion progress variable PDFs is not invoked, then, the

PAnother fundamental challenge consists of the following. The defi-
nition the combustion progress variable given by Eq. (29) should be
revisited in the case of stratified burning [143]. In particular, Yu should
be substituted with mass fraction Yu(Z) associated with pure mixing
without combustion and Yb should be substituted with mass fraction
Yb(Z) of the considered species in equilibrium combustion products
corresponding to the local Z. In the case of lean or rich burning,
Yb(Z) vanishes if the mass fraction Y is associated with the deficient
reactant (fuel or oxygen, respectively), but such a simplification does
not hold in a general case. To find Yu(Z), it is worth remembering
_vm 1⁄4 0; Eq. (8) written for
that, in the case of pure mixing, i.e.
ðYm (cid:1)Ym;1Þ=ðYm;2 (cid:1)Ym;1Þ reduces to Eq. (18) with the same boundary
conditions of Z2 1⁄4 1 and Z1 1⁄4 0. Therefore, solutions to the two trans-
port equations should be the same and, hence, YuðZÞ 1⁄4 Y1 þ ZðY2 (cid:1)Y1Þ
for the mass fraction Y of a fuel or oxidant. Accordingly, Eq. (29) reads

at high Reynolds numbers. However, as discussed in Section 5, other
modeling issues should be addressed if c is substituted with YF in
order to characterize the state of the mixture.

PMoreover, it is worth remembering that certain models of pre-
mixed turbulent combustion do not associate c with the normalized
temperature or mass fraction, but consider c to be an indicator vari-
able, which has solely two values, either zero in unburned mixture
or unity in equilibrium combustion products. Accordingly, instanta-
neous and Favre-averaged transport equations for c read

respectively, with the RHSs involving Dirac delta function. Within
the framework of such an approach, which was introduced into the
turbulent combustion literature by Prudnikov [125(cid:1)127], (i) fresh
reactants and equilibrium combustion products are assumed to be
separated by an infinitely thin self-propagating interface, (ii) c is
considered to be the probability of finding the products, and (iii) the
BML Eqs. (47)(cid:1)(50), and (74) hold with g ! 0. Contrary to Eq. (59),
Eq. (69) does not involve an extra term in a stratified flame when
compared to a premixed flame, but the term ruSL;uj r cj could be
affected by eventual correlation between SL, u(Z) and |rc|. To the best
of the present author’s knowledge, such a correlation has not yet
been investigated.

PModels developed to close the RHS of Eq. (69) in the case of pre-
mixed turbulent combustion are reviewed elsewhere [24,63], while
recent applications of this approach to simulations of stratified
turbulent burning will be discussed in Section 5.

3. Tools for basic research into stratified combustion

PBefore discussing various basic effects revealed by investigating
stratified flames, it is worth briefly introducing research tools that
were utilized in those studies. In the present paper, both experiment
and DNS are considered to be equally valuable tools for revealing
such effects and for developing, assessing, and validating theoretical
and numerical (RANS or LES) models of stratified turbulent burning.
Accordingly, experimental and DNS setups applied to research into
stratified combustion are reviewed in the present section, whereas
various RANS and LES models of stratified turbulent flames will be
discussed in Section 5.

PIt is worth stressing that the present section is mainly restricted
to summarizing research tools that were developed for investigating
stratified flames. Results of these investigations will be discussed in
Section 4.

PIt is also worth stressing that the contents of the present section
are restricted to experimental and DNS studies that aimed at

Pinvestigating the influence of mixture inhomogeneities on major
combustion characteristics. Accordingly, studies of partially pre-
mixed flames that addressed other issues are beyond the scope of
the present paper, even if stratified mode of burning existed locally
in those flames.

3.1. Experimental facilities and techniques

P3.1.1. Laminar flames

PExperiments performed with stratified laminar flames by various
research groups are summarized in Table 1, where a type of
steady stratification is characterized with a scalar vector product of
rF ¢ rc. A positive (negative) value of this product indicates that the
equivalence ratio F is higher (lower) in burned mixture when com-
pared to reactants. If a mixture is lean and rF ¢ rc is positive, such a
stratified combustion is known as back-supported burning, because
fluxes of heat and active species from the products support flame
propagation to the leaner mixture, as further discussed in Section 4.1.
In the case of a rich mixture, the sign of rF ¢ rc is insufficient to
decide whether combustion is back-supported or front-supported,
because directions of fluxes of heat and certain radicals may be
opposite in such a case.

PGirard et al. [145] studied growth of a laminar hemispherical
flame kernel in a lean propane(cid:1)air (0.65 (cid:2) F (cid:2) 0.8) or hydrogen(cid:1)air
(0.12 (cid:2) F (cid:2) 0.4) mixture in a vessel. The mixture stratification was
created by filling a soap bubble with a richer mixture (F 1⁄4 1:1 and
0.9 for C3H8 and H2, respectively), followed by spark discharge in
the center of the bubble. An increase in the pressure in the vessel
was recorded and the flame kernel was visualized using Schlieren
technique. A significant acceleration of burning due to mixture

Pstratification was documented by measuring combustion time tc,
i.e. time required for the pressure p to reach its maximum value pm
(at t > tc, the pressure was decreased due to heat losses). The values
of pm and tc were increased and decreased, respectively, when the
radius of the bubble was increased. Moreover, an extension of the
lean flammability limit was obtained for hydrogen in the stratified
cases. These findings are associated with back-supported combus-
tion, which will be discussed in Section 4.1.

PIshikawa [146,147] built a diffusion combustor where a mixing
layer, characterized by 1D gradient of the equivalence ratio, devel-
oped between top and bottom layers of fuel (CH4) and oxidant,
respectively, due to molecular diffusion after withdrawing a plate
that separated the fuel and oxidant layers initially. Propagation of a
stratified laminar flame (i) was triggered by a line igniter, which was
installed parallel to the direction of rF, and (ii) was visualized using
Schlieren technique. Due to dependence of the local flame speed on
the local equivalence ratio, the flame advanced the furthest in the
vicinity of the stoichiometric layer and the mean flame surface
attained a curved shape.

PRa and Cheng [148] experimentally investigated the influence
of mixture stratification on expansion of spherical
laminar
methane(cid:1)air flames in a confined vessel. The stratification was
created by placing a small spherical soap bubble in the center of
the vessel, with the equivalence ratio F1 (cid:2) 1.0 within the bubble
being larger than or equal to the equivalence ratio 0.5 (cid:2) F2 (cid:2)
0.7 in the remaining of the vessel. The mixture in the center of
the bubble was ignited by a laser beam and the growth of the
flame kernel radius Rf(t) was recorded using high speed Schlieren
movies. Subsequently, the flame speed was evaluated as follows

an opposed jet flame stabilized in the vicinity of a stagnation plane
created due to collision of (i) a flow of hot products of combustion a
lean (F 1⁄4 0:4) hydrogen-air mixture and (ii) a rich (F 1⁄4 1:25) or
lean (F 1⁄4 0:64 or 0.60) propane(cid:1)air flow. Such a flame configura-
tion, sketched in Fig. 1a, is known as Products-To-Reactants (PTR)
flame. If both counter-flows supply reactants, see Fig. 1b, such a
flame configuration is known as Reactants-To-Reactants (RTR) flame.
In the paper by Wehrmeyer et al. [149], the measured spatial profiles
of temperature and mole fractions were compared with results of
numerical simulations.

PXiong and Roberts [150] reported images of a lean (F 1⁄4 0:6)
methane(cid:1)air flame kernel interacting with a toroidal vortex with a
different equivalence ratio (pure air, F 1⁄4 0:3; 0.6, 1.0, 1.5, or pure
CH4). The images were captured by recording CH*-chemilumines-
cence from the kernel.

PKang and Kyritsis [151(cid:1)153] studied propagation of a 1D planar
laminar flame in the direction z of a stationary spatial gradient of
the equivalence ratio. In order to create such a stationary 1D strati-
fication of reactant composition, Kang and Kyritsis [151(cid:1)153]
metered two CH4-air mixtures of different F through the top and
the bottom of a vessel, with the velocities of the two counter-flows
being very low (less than 1 cm/s). Accordingly, due to such low
flow velocities, a stationary balance between the vertical convec-
tion and diffusion fluxes of the fuel was established, with various
local values of both F(z) and dF/dz being obtained by changing the
relative velocity of the two flows and their compositions. The distri-
butions of the equivalence ratio in unburned gas along the vertical
axis of the vessel were measured using planar laser induced fluo-
rescence (PLIF) of acetone.

PIn each case, stratified mixture was ignited by a spark in the cen-
tral part of the vessel. Subsequent downward propagation of the
flame was monitored using a high speed camera and the flame speed
SL was evaluated. Upward propagation of the flame was bounded by
placing a screen immediately above the spark plug. A number of
dependencies of SL(z) were reported [151(cid:1)153] for different F(z)
and dF/dz.

PDegardin et al. [154] experimentally investigated stationary
2D laminar methane(cid:1)air V-shaped flames stabilized behind a
wire, with the mixture stratification being created using nine
fuel(cid:1)air streams through nine parallel compartments. The equiv-
alence ratio was decreased from the flame axis (stream no. 5) to
the side streams nos. 1 and 9. Locally normal (to the flame)
spatial profiles of F and T, obtained simultaneously using ace-
tone PLIF and Rayleigh scattering, respectively, were reported.

PFlow velocity was measured using Laser Doppler Anemometry
(LDA) technique.

PTo study propagation of an oblique unconfined flame in a strati-
fied mixture, Galizzi and Escudi(cid:3)e [155] performed experiments with
rod-stabilized laminar premixed V-shaped flames and injected pure
methane into lean (F 1⁄4 0:58) CH4(cid:1)air mixture through a small orifice
placed upstream of the rod at fixed distances from the nozzle exit and
centerline. The velocity field in unburned gas was characterized using
both LDA and particle image velocimetry (PIV) techniques. Flame was
visualized using laser tomography and CH* chemiluminescence was
also recorded. Temperature was measured using thermo-couples. The
concentration of methane was determined using a sampling probe
connected to a gas analyzer. Under conditions of this experiment, a
peninsula of burned gas, separated from the main oblique flame front
by a strip of stratified reactants, appeared. Accordingly, in the vicinity
of the peninsula, different branches of the flame front experienced dif-
ferent types of stratification, i.e. F changed not only in the direction
locally normal to the flame front, but also in the direction locally paral-
lel to the front. The focus of the study was placed on the shape of the
peninsula and velocity field in its vicinity, with the transverse profiles
of the temperature and intensity of CH* chemiluminescence being
also reported.

PBalusamy et al. [156] investigated three stratified laminar flames
propagating in a constant volume chamber. In order to create strati-
fication of reactant composition, a rich propane(cid:1)air mixture was
injected into a quiescent lean (F0 1⁄4 0:6) C3H8(cid:1)air mixture, followed
by (i) spark ignition 215 ms after the injection and (ii) propagation
of a richer flame kernel into the lean reactants. The local equivalence
ratio Fi near the spark plug at the ignition instant was changed by
varying the composition of the rich mixture. Three cases character-
ized by Fi 1⁄4 1:24 § 0:06; Fi 1⁄4 0:95 § 0:06; and Fi 1⁄4 0:79 § 0:03
were studied. The local equivalence ratio in unburned gas was char-
acterized using anisole PLIF. The local flame speeds conditioned to
the local stretch rate and equivalence ratio were measured using a
combined PIV-PLIF technique. The focus of the study was placed
on the evolution of the flame speed during expansion of the flame
kernel.

PAx and Meier [157] experimentally investigated lean methane(cid:1)
air laminar Bunsen flames subject to oscillations of the equivalence
ratio in the incoming flow of unburned mixture. The experiments
were performed under a low pressure of 0.07 bar. The shape and
position of the flame were visualized using OH* chemiluminescence.
Spatial profiles of CH4, O2, N2, CO2, H2O, CO, H2, OH*, and tempera-
ture along the flame centerline were measured using Raman scatter-
ing. The focus of the study was placed on the response of these
profiles to oscillations of different frequencies varied from 5 to
50 Hz.

P3.1.2. Turbulent flames

PExperiments performed with stratified turbulent flames by vari-
ous research groups are summarized in Table 2. It is worth noting
that the content of the present subsection is not restricted to a
brief overview of experimental facilities and diagnostic techniques,
but certain measured results will also be addressed. However,
experimental findings relevant to back-supported combustion and
generation of flame-surface area due to inhomogeneities of
unburned mixture will mainly be discussed in Sections 4.1 and 4.2,
respectively.

PCho and Santavicca [158] investigated growth of a weakly turbu-
lent (u0 1⁄4 0:25 m/s) flame kernel in a globally stoichiometric, but
locally inhomogeneous propane(cid:1)air mixture. The mixture inhomo-
geneities were created by injecting a small amount of fuel into
homogeneous fuel(cid:1)air mixture 10 mm upstream of test section of
the burner, where the mixture was ignited by a spark. The extent of
the inhomogeneities was varied by changing the amount of the
injected fuel. Turbulence was characterized using LDA techniques.
The degree of fuel(cid:1)air mixing in the test section was evaluated using
NO2 laser induced fluorescence (LIF) technique, i.e. the fuel was

Preplaced “with an equivalent volume flow rate of nitrogen” doped
with 6500 ppm of NO2 and the concentration of NO2 was measured
using LIF. The growth of the flame kernel was recorded using high

PTo study weakly turbulent (u0 (cid:2) 0.289 m/s) stratified burning,
Zhou et al. [159,160] injected propane into a cylindrical vessel filled
with air, followed by (i) a few cycles of reciprocating movement of
two identical perforated plates in the vessel and (ii) subsequent
spark ignition of the nonuniform C3H8(cid:1)air mixture in the center of
the vessel. At the ignition instant, (i) the degree of the mixture inho-
mogeneity, i.e. the magnitude of fluctuations in the equivalence
ratio, and (ii) the rms turbulent velocity were independently varied
by changing (i) the number of cycles of the reciprocating movement
of the plates and (ii) the time interval between the end of the last
cycle and the spark discharge, respectively. The degree of the mix-
ture inhomogeneity was quantified by measuring the fuel concentra-
tion using Rayleigh scattering techniques. Expansion of the flame
kernel was visualized using high-speed Schlieren technique. The

PThe so-called ORACLE burner, see Fig. 2(a), was designed by Besson
et al. [162(cid:1)164] in order to study statistically stationary, 2D stratified
turbulent flames stabilized due to an abrupt expansion of a channel. In
this burner, mixture stratification was created using two lean propane-
(cid:1)air streams characterized by different F and separated by a plate,
with the plate edge being installed at a distance of 70.4 mm upstream
of the channel expansion. Data obtained from ORACLE-burner flames
were widely used in subsequent numerical simulations of stratified
turbulent combustion, as will be discussed later.

PMansour [165,166] designed a concentric flow conical nozzle
burner for studying statistically stationary, confined, partially pre-
mixed, highly turbulent flames. In this burner, mixture stratification
was created using two concentric jets of air (inner jet) and very rich
methane(cid:1)air mixture (outer jet). By changing the distance between
the jet exits and the inlet of the conical nozzle, the level of premixing
at the inlet was varied. Flame stabilization was achieved due to a
decrease in the mean axial flow velocity in the conical nozzle.

PRenou et al. [167] studied expansion of weakly turbulent flame
kernels in inhomogeneous propane(cid:1)air mixture. Stratification of the
mixture composition was created using nine streams to supply
fuel(cid:1)air mixtures characterized by various F, with j r Fj reaching
70 m(cid:1)1 at the ignition plane, see Fig. 5 in the cited paper. The mixture
was ignited by a spark located near the exit of the central stream,
through which the stoichiometric mixture was supplied. Subse-
quently, a flame kernel was advected by mean flow and propagated
to leaner mixture. Flow field was characterized using LDA in the
non-reacting case. Local mixture composition was monitored using
acetone PLIF. 2D images of expanding flame kernels were obtained
using laser tomography. By processing such images, the equivalent
flame radius and local curvature k of the flame contour were evalu-
ated.

PPasquier et al. [168] simultaneously applied PIV and LIF of anisole
to weakly (u0 » 0.3 m/s) turbulent homogeneous or stratified pro-
pane(cid:1)air flames propagating in a constant volume chamber. In a
stratified case, pure propane was injected into a lean (F 1⁄4 0:6) qui-
escent mixture, with turbulence being generated by the fuel jet.
After some delay required for properly mixing the fuel with lean
reactants in the vicinity of a spark plug, a flame was ignited by the
spark in a near-stoichiometric mixture and, then, propagated to the

Plean mixture. By processing simultaneous PIV and LIF images, an
area Af enveloped by the instantaneous flame front was determined
ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi
and the equivalent flame radius Rf 1⁄4

was evaluated. The

observed turbulent flame speed was equal to dRf

PRobin et al. [169] experimentally investigated statistically sta-
tionary weakly turbulent (u0 < 0.24 m/s) CH4(cid:1)air V-shaped flames
stabilized behind a wire, with the mixture stratification being cre-
ated using nine premixed fuel(cid:1)air streams through nine parallel
compartments, see Fig. 2(b). This setup was similar to a burner used
by Degardin et al. [154] to study laminar stratified flames, but Robin
et al. [169] used grids to generate turbulent flows. The equivalence
ratio was decreased from a maximum value (0.8, 1.0, or 1.2) reached
at the flame axis (stream no. 5) to zero in the side streams nos. 1 and
9. The flow was characterized using LDA and PIV. The temperature
and fuel mole fraction were simultaneously measured using Ray-
leigh scattering and acetone PLIF, respectively. Reported in the paper
are transverse profiles of the mean equivalence ratio, its variance,
mean longitudinal and transverse velocities, and mean combustion
progress variable, measured at different distances from flame holder.
Such data are of particular interest for model validation and a single
RANS model was assessed in the cited paper. Moreover, a particular
emphasis was placed on measuring the local and instantaneous
flame thickness, with a decrease in the thickness due to mixture
stratification being noted.

PIn the experiments by Bonaldo and Kelman [170], open turbulent
flames were stabilized using weak swirl and annular stratification
was created using two co-axial round jets fed with methane-air
mixtures characterized by two different F < 1, with j r Fj reaching
10 m(cid:1)1 at distance of 30 mm downstream of the nozzle, see Fig. 4a
in the cited paper.

PThree components of velocity vectors were measured using
stereoscopic PIV on a vertical plane at the point of flame stabili-
zation. The instantaneous 2D fields of temperature and fuel con-
centration were obtained using laser induced Rayleigh scattering
and acetone PLIF,
respectively. Bonaldo and Kelman [170]
reported transverse profiles of the mean equivalence ratio, mean
components of velocity vector and their rms values, measured at
two different distances from the nozzle exit. Moreover, axial pro-
files of the mean velocity were measured. The focus of the study
was placed on obtaining PDFs for local flamelet displacement
speed Sd, thickness, and curvature k.

PDreizler et al. [171(cid:1)174] designed a so-called Darmstadt burner,
see Fig. 2(c), to study the influence of shear and stratification on lean
combustion in moderate and intense turbulence. The burner consists
of three concentric slots surrounded by a slow co-flow of air. The
central slot is fed with hot combustion products and serves to stabi-
lize a stratified flame at the exit of the slot. Two other concentric
slots are fed with lean fuel(cid:1)air mixtures characterized by either the
same or different equivalence ratios.

PThe velocity field was characterized using both LDA and PIV
[171]. Flame front and mixing field were visualized using PLIF of OH
and acetone, respectively [172]. Instantaneous profiles of tempera-
ture and concentrations of CH4, O2, N2, CO2, and H2O were measured
using 1D Raman/Rayleigh scattering [173].

PBecause the Darmstadt-burner flames were well characterized
using various advanced laser diagnostics techniques and the flame
configuration is relatively simple, these experiments are widely
used to test various RANS and LES models of stratified turbulent
combustion. In flame A, which is most often addressed in numerical
simulations, F 1⁄4 0:9 and 0.6 in the medium and outer slots, respec-
tively, and j r Fj reaches 100 m(cid:1)1 at distance of 5 mm downstream
of the nozzle, see Fig. 18 in [173].

PRecently, Stahler et al. [174] applied CO LIF and crossed-planar
Rayleigh imaging to a single stratified Darmstadt flame A. The
latter diagnostic techniques allowed the authors (i) to measure

Pthe local flame structure, e.g. (i) an increase in the slope of the locally
normal profiles T(r*) by the stratification level, and (ii) an increase in
the local YH2 ðTÞ and rT(T) by DF/Dr* on the reactant side of the
flame. Moreover, the authors stressed an important role played by
molecular diffusion of light species such as H2 under conditions of
their experiments.

PVarious turbulent stratified flames were investigated in great
details exploiting Cambridge slot [175(cid:1)177] and swirl [178(cid:1)184]
burners, see Fig. 2(d) and 2(e), respectively. The slot burner [176]
consists of six parallel 2D slots supplied with air (the left and right
slots), leaner (the second and third slots from the left in Fig. 2(d))
and richer (the second and third slots from the right) methane(cid:1)air
mixtures. A level of stratification is varied by changing the equiva-
lence ratios F1 and F2 in the leaner and richer slots, respectively,
with j r Fj reaching 150 m(cid:1)1 at distance of 25 mm downstream of
the nozzle, see Fig. 3 in [175]. A stratified statistically 2D V-shaped
flame is stabilized by a rod set 10 mm downstream of the slot exits
and 2 mm to the right of the centerline. Flow and mixture character-
istics were measured in a rectangular area that contained the left
flame wing. Accordingly, the equivalence ratio was statistically
higher (lower) in combustion products (reactants).

PThe swirl burner [178], see Fig. 2(e), consists of two concentric
tubes surrounded with a co-flow. A leaner mixture (F1 (cid:2) F2) is sup-
plied through the outer tube. A level of stratification is varied by
changing F1 and F2, with j r Fj reaching 300 m(cid:1)1 at distance of
10 mm downstream of the nozzle, see Fig. B.12 in the cited paper. A
flame is stabilized by a bluff body placed at the center of the nozzle
exit, see yellow disk in Fig. 2(e). Accordingly, the equivalence ratio is
statistically higher (lower) in combustion products (reactants).
Swirled flow can be generated in the outer tube, but the burner can
also be operated without swirl [179].

PMeasurements were performed using two advanced optical diag-
nostic systems developed at University of Cambridge and Sandia.
The Sandia diagnostics included simultaneous line Raman/Rayleigh
scattering, two-photon LIF of CO, crossed planar LIF of OH [175,178].
The Cambridge diagnostics included PIV, LDA, and acetone and OH

PGalizzi and Escudi(cid:3)e [185] performed experiments with rod-stabi-
lized, weakly (u0 1⁄4 0:2 m/s) turbulent, lean (F 1⁄4 0:61) methane(cid:1)air
V-shaped flames. To create mixture stratification, CH4 was injected
into the main flow through a small orifice placed upstream of the
rod at fixed distances from the nozzle exit and centerline. Accord-
ingly, one wing of the V-shaped flame was stabilized in the homoge-
neous mixture, while the opposite wing was stabilized in a stratified
mixture, with j r Fj reaching 100 m(cid:1)1 at the nozzle, see Fig. 2 in the
cited paper. The velocity field in unburned gas was characterized
using both LDA and PIV techniques. Flame was visualized using
laser tomography and CH* chemiluminescence was also recorded.
Temperature was measured using thermo-couples. The concentra-
tion of methane was determined using a sampling probe connected
to a gas analyzer. Galizzi and Escudi(cid:3)e [185] reported radial profiles
of rms values of two components of velocity vector, mean equiva-
lence ratio, mean temperature, and mean intensity of CH* chemilu-
minescence, measured at different distances from the rod that
stabilized the flame.

PCoriton et al. [186] simultaneously applied OH and CO PLIF to
three highly turbulent (Ret 1⁄4 1050; u0/SL (cid:4) 7.5) stratified CH4/O2/N2
flames stabilized in the PTR stagnation-point configuration, see
Fig. 1a and note that the mean flame brush is thick in the case of tur-
bulent combustion. In all three cases, one stream consisted of the
equilibrium products of combustion of a stoichiometric CH4/O2/N2
mixture, with the product temperature being equal to 1850 K due to
a larger amount of N2 than in air. In the reactant stream, not only the
equivalence ratio (Fr 1⁄4 1:0; 0.70, or 0.575), but also a ratio of mass
fractions of O2 and N2 were varied in order for the laminar flame
speeds to be approximately the same in the three cases. The focus of
the study was placed on the extinction of the flames at a sufficiently
high bulk strain rate 2U=d 1⁄4 1:55 ms(cid:1)1; where U is the bulk velocity
at the burner outlet and d is the distance between the two nozzles. It
was shown that the CO+OH reaction was completely extinguished at
Fr 1⁄4 1:0; but was active in the two other cases. The authors attrib-
uted the extinction of this reaction at Fr 1⁄4 1:0 to “diffusion of OH
radical in the counter-flowing products of combustion” [186]. These
experimental data were supplemented by results of numerical simu-
lations of three similar, but laminar stratified flames, which (simula-
tions) also showed extinction of the oxidation layer (the CO+OH
reaction) in the case of Fr 1⁄4 1:0.

PIn subsequent studies of highly turbulent stratified CH4/O2/N2
flames stabilized in the PTR stagnation-point configuration, the
same group experimentally investigated the response of such
flames (i)
to independent variations in the bulk strain rate
2U=d 1⁄4 1:4(cid:1)2:24 ms(cid:1)1; turbulent Reynolds number Ret 1⁄4 470(cid:1)1050;
reactant composition (0.5 (cid:2) Fr (cid:2) 1.2 with O2/N2 mole ratio of
30/70), and the temperature Tp 1⁄4 1700(cid:1)1950 K of the stoichiometric
combustion products [187] and (ii) to independent variations in
0.5 (cid:2) Fr (cid:2) 1.2 (with O2/N2 mole ratio of 30/70) and Fp 1⁄4 0:7; 1.0,

P1.2 with Tp 1⁄4 1850 K (due to variations in O2/N2 mole ratio in the
products), Ret 1⁄4 1050; and 2U=d 1⁄4 1:4 ms(cid:1)1 [188].
In the latter
work, simultaneous OH and CO PLIF were supplemented with simul-
taneous OH and CH2O PLIF in order to obtain 2D images of the local
CO+OH and CH2O+OH reaction rates.
It was shown that these
reactions were more readily quenched due to the depletion of OH
radicals in the case of Fp 1⁄4 1:0 when compared to Fp 1⁄4 1:2 and,
especially, 0.7.

PVena et al. [189(cid:1)191] simultaneously applied OH and CH2O PLIF
techniques in order to obtain 2D images of instantaneous HRR (a
product of pixel-by-pixel intensities of OH and CH2O images) from
stratified, V-shaped, weakly turbulent (0.5 < u0/SL < 1.1) isooctane/
air flames. The stratification of the reactant composition was
obtained (i) using two streams of isooctane/air mixtures character-
ized by different F and (ii) allowing the streams to mix before a
flame holder. Exploiting a specially designed mixing facility, almost
linear dependence of the mean F on the transverse coordinate y
was obtained. Accordingly, the degree of mixture inhomogeneity
was quantified with the transverse gradient r yF of the mean
equivalence ratio, which was measured using PLIF of 3-pentanone
seeded in the fuel. Positive values of r yF were obtained from
flames associated with richer products and leaner reactants. Under
conditions of the experiments, r yF was varied (i) from -1 m(cid:1)1 (a
reference premixed case) to 29 m(cid:1)1 in five different near-stoichio-
metric 0:95(cid:2)F(cid:2)1:05 cases, (ii) from (cid:1)14 to 12 m(cid:1)1 in five different
rich 1:15(cid:2)F(cid:2)1:25 cases, and (iii) from (cid:1)1 to 24 m(cid:1)1 in three differ-
ent lean 0:85(cid:2)F(cid:2)0:95 cases.

PThe focus of the study was placed on small regions within the
mean flame brush that were characterized by weak variations in the
local equivalence ratio. In addition to 2D images of the instantaneous
HRR and its PDF, dependencies of the mean FSD S 1⁄4 j r cj and the
mean HRR on the mean combustion progress variable were also
reported, as well as PDF of the local curvature k of the heat release
zone and dependencies of the local HRR and the local thickness dr of
reaction zone on the local curvature. The thickness was equal to the
width of the local profile of HRR, evaluated at its half maximum. The
velocity field was characterized using LDA in non-reacting cases.

PMeares and Masri

[192] modified the well-known Sydney
piloted burner [193,194] in order to investigate inhomogeneously
premixed turbulent flames, see Fig. 2(f). The modified burner
known as Sydney inhomogeneous piloted burner is assembled of
three concentric tubes. The outer tube serves to create a pilot
stream required to stabilize burning of a fuel and air, which are
separately supplied through the two other, medium and inner
tubes. The degree of the mixture inhomogeneity in the flame can
be varied by changing the distance between the exit of the inner
central tube and the exits of the two other tubes. When this dis-
tance is large, a homogeneous premixed flame is stabilized. When
the exits of all three tubes belong to the same horizontal plane, a
non-premixed flame is stabilized. Partially premixed combustion
occurs in intermediate cases.

PMeares and Masri [192] characterized the velocity field in the
Sydney inhomogeneous piloted burner using LDA and measured
instantaneous 2D fields of the mixture fraction using Rayleigh scat-
tering. They reported improvement of stability limits of piloted jet
flames due to stratification of the mixture composition at the
medium nozzle (when compared to both non-premixed and homo-
geneously premixed flames, with all other things being equal) when
the fuel was supplied through the inner jet. On the contrary, when
the fuel was injected from the medium tube, the stability limits
were not improved. The point is that the bulk equivalence ratio at
the medium nozzle was well above the rich flammability limit in the
latter case. Therefore, the probability of finding flammable mixture
in the vicinity of the pilot stream, i.e. at the outer exit boundary of
the outer medium tube, was low when the fuel was injected from
the medium tube.

PStabilization of a single premixed turbulent flame and a single
stratified methane(cid:1)air turbulent flame using the Sydney inhomoge-
neous piloted burner was compared by Meares et al. [195] exploiting
line Raman(cid:1)Rayleigh scattering and CO-LIF diagnostics developed
at Sandia, as well as OH-diagnostics developed in Sydney. Under
conditions of those measurements, the mixture inhomogeneities
improved the flame stability when combustion occurred in multiple
modes, i.e. in a near-stoichiometric stratified mode of burning in the
vicinity of the medium nozzle and in a diffusion mode of burning at
ten jet diameters from the nozzle.

PStabilization of stratified turbulent flames using the Sydney inho-
mogeneous piloted burner was intensively investigated over the
past years. In particular, Barlow et al. [196] reported a large amount
of experimental data obtained using the aforementioned advanced
optical diagnostic tools from four stratified flames, as well as a single
premixed flame. Cutcher et al. [197] complemented the study by
Barlow et al. [196] by increasing resolution of measuring the scalar
dissipation rate for the mixture fraction. Guiberti et al. [198] com-
pared flame stabilization for three different fuels (compressed natu-
ral gas CNG, liquefied petroleum gas LPG, and di-methyl ether DME)
and complemented the set of laser diagnostic tools with simulta-
neous OH and CH2O PLIF 2D images “collected at a repetition rate of
10 kHz”.

PIt is worth remembering that, in all the aforementioned experi-
ments with the Sydney inhomogeneous piloted burner, the bulk
equivalence ratio at the exit of the medium tube was well above the
rich flammability limit. Most experiments with methane and CNG
[192,195(cid:1)197] were performed at the bulk F 1⁄4 4:79; while compar-
ison of the CNG, LPG, and DME flames [198] was done at the bulk
F 1⁄4 2:9. Therefore, from the global perspective, all these flames are
similar to lifted jet flames rather than inhomogeneously premixed
flames even if the stratified mode of burning is responsible for the
improved stability of the flames.

3.2. Direct numerical simulations

P3.2.1. Laminar flames

PSimulations of stratified laminar flames, performed by various

research groups, are summarized in Table 3.

PLauvergne and Egolfopoulos [199] numerically studied two iden-
tical unsteady 1D propane(cid:1)air flames stabilized using the RTR
counter-flow configuration, see Fig. 1b. Mixture inhomogeneities
were created due to oscillations of the inlet equivalence ratio with
time around unity. The magnitude and frequency of the oscillations
were varied from 0.22 to 0.42 and from 100 to 2000 Hz, respectively.
The computations were performed using a detailed chemical mecha-
nism that contained 38 species and 220 reactions.

PSteady and unsteady 1D methane(cid:1)air flames were simulated by
Marzouk et al. [200] using the PTR counter-flow configuration, see
Fig. 1a. In the steady case, the equivalence ratio Fr of the reactants
was set equal to 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, or 1.0, whereas the
equivalence ratio Fp of the products was either the same (premixed
burning) or equal to unity (stratified burning). In the unsteady case,
Fr decreased linearly with time from 1.0 to 0.3 over four spans
(1.75, 3.5, 17.5, and 35 ms), whereas FpðtÞ 1⁄4 Frðt(cid:1)DtÞ with Dt 1⁄4 1
ms. The computations were performed using a detailed chemical
mechanism that contained 16 species and 46 reactions.

PPirez da Cruz et al. [201] simulated propagation of an 1D adia-
batic methane(cid:1)air flame subject to a step change of the equivalence
ratio Fðx; t 1⁄4 0Þ in unburned gas. The following four cases were
studied; (i) a drop in Fðx; t 1⁄4 0Þ from 1.0 to 0.35, (ii) a jump in
Fðx; t 1⁄4 0Þ from 1.0 to 2.5, (iii) a drop in Fðx; t 1⁄4 0Þ from 1.5 to 1.0,
and (iv) a jump in Fðx; t 1⁄4 0Þ from 1.0 to 2.5 at x1 followed by a drop
in Fðx; t 1⁄4 0Þ from 2.5 to 0.0 at x2, and a jump in Fðx; t 1⁄4 0Þ to 1.0 at
x3. Due to molecular diffusion, such discontinuities in Fðx; t 1⁄4 0Þ
were smoothed out when a flame reached the region of

Pinhomogeneous F. The computations were performed using a
detailed chemical mechanism that contained 32 species and 177
reactions.

PSankaran and Im [202] numerically studied two identical
unsteady 1D lean methane(cid:1)air flames stabilized using the RTR
counter-flow configuration, see Fig. 1b. Mixture inhomogeneities
were created due to oscillations of the inlet equivalence ratio with
time around unity. The maximum inlet equivalence ratio was close
to unity, while the minimum value of F(t) was varied. The frequency
of the oscillations was also varied from 10 to 1000 Hz, respectively.
The computations were performed using GRI-3.0 chemical mecha-
nism [203].

PA similar problem was numerically investigated by K€onig et al.
[204], but the strain rate also oscillated with time at the same fre-
quency, which was varied from 20 to 1000 Hz both for the inlet
equivalence ratio and strain rate. The equivalence ratio oscillated
around F 1⁄4 1:0 and the amplitude of the oscillations in YCH4 was
equal to 10% of its mean value. The computations were performed
using a detailed chemical mechanism that contained 34 species and
159 reactions.

PRichardson et al. [205] simulated (i) steady 1D stratified combus-
tion of lean methane(cid:1)air mixtures in the PTR counter-flow configu-
see Fig. 1a, with either Fr 1⁄4 0:6 and Fp 1⁄4 0:9 or
ration,
Fr 1⁄4 0:9 and Fp 1⁄4 0:6; and (ii) unsteady 1D identical RTR flames
subject to oscillations in the equivalence ratio with time at fre-
quency f 1⁄4 10(cid:1)200 Hz. The amplitude of the oscillations was varied
from 0.28 to 0.90, with the highest (lowest) amplitude being set for
the highest (lowest) frequency, respectively. The computations were
performed using GRI-3.0 chemical mechanism [203].

PCoriton et al. [206] also simulated steady 1D stratified combus-
tion of lean and stoichiometric methane(cid:1)air mixtures in the PTR
stagnation-point configuration, see Fig. 1a. Contrary to computations
by Marzouk et al. [200] or by Richardson et al. [205], the focus of the
study by Coriton et al. [206] was placed on effects caused by varia-
tions in the composition of the products. Both 0.35 (cid:2) Fr (cid:2) 1.0 and
0.73 (cid:2) Fp (cid:2) 1.0 were varied independently from one another, with
the product temperature being always kept equal to 1800 K by
changing the concentration of nitrogen in the products of combus-
tion of CH4/O2/N2 mixtures. Simulations were also performed in the
case of a “product” stream that contained solely N2. The computa-
tions were performed using a detailed chemical mechanism that
contained 46 species and 235 reversible reactions.

PZhou and Hochgreb [207] also simulated steady 1D stratified
combustion of methane-air mixtures in the PTR stagnation-point

Pconfiguration with Fr 1⁄4 0:6 or 0.9 and Fp 1⁄4 0:6 or 0.9. The compu-
tations were performed using GRI-3.0 chemical mechanism [203].

PShi et al. [208] simulated 1D planar laminar flames that propa-
gated from a homogeneous hydrogen(cid:1)air mixture characterized
with F1 1⁄4 0:5 or 2.0 to a homogeneous hydrogen(cid:1)air mixture char-
acterized with F2 1⁄4 2:0 or 0.5, respectively. By changing a distance
between the initial flame kernel and a point where a step change in
F from F1 to F2 was set at t 1⁄4 0; a time tm required for the flame to
move to the mixing layer was varied. Accordingly, the magnitude of
the local gradient of F experienced by the flame when crossing the
mixing layer at t 1⁄4 tm was also varied. The computations were per-
formed using a 9-species detailed chemical mechanism. Two sets of
simulations were performed either setting Lek 1⁄4 1 for all species or
invoking an approximation of mixture-averaged diffusivities.

P3.2.2. Turbulent flames

PDirect Numerical Simulations of stratified turbulent flames, per-

formed by various research groups, are summarized in Table 4.

PH(cid:3)elie and Trouv(cid:3)e [209] performed a 3D DNS study of highly tur-
bulent (u0=SL 1⁄4 7:5 at t 1⁄4 0) statistically planar flames that propa-
gated in temporally decaying,
isotropic turbulence. In order to
mimic mixture inhomogeneities, the initial field of Fðx; t 1⁄4 0Þ was
specified so that (i) the PDF PðF; t 1⁄4 0Þ was a sum of two Dirac delta
functions peaked at F § F0
and (ii) an integral scale of that field was
equal to LF. Under conditions of the simulations, F 1⁄4 1:0; LF=L 1⁄4
1:0 or 2.0, and F0
1⁄4 0:06; 0.3, or 0.6. Combustion chemistry was
reduced to a single irreversible reaction between a generic fuel and
oxygen.

PHaworth et al. [210] performed a 2D DNS study of moderately
turbulent (u0=SL 1⁄4 4:7 at t 1⁄4 0) statistically planar propane(cid:1)air
flames subject to harmonic spatial variations of the equivalence
ratio (from 0.5 to 2.7 with F 1⁄4 1:0) in the transverse direction in
the incoming flow. The computations were performed using a
semi-detailed chemical mechanism that contained 29 species and
73 reactions.

PJim(cid:3)enez et al. [211] performed a 2D DNS study of highly turbulent
(u0=SL 1⁄4 11:6 at t 1⁄4 0) statistically planar propane(cid:1)air flames that
propagated in temporally decaying, isotropic turbulence. Mixture
inhomogeneities were simulated by prescribing spatial variations in
F in the transverse direction. Both the magnitude and length scale
of these variations were varied. The computations were performed
using a semi-detailed chemical mechanism that contained 28 spe-
cies and 73 reactions.

PGarrido-L(cid:3)opez and Sarkar [212] performed a 2D DNS study of
lean (F 1⁄4 0:8) laminar and turbulent statistically planar flames sub-
ject to mixture-fraction fluctuations that were imposed using a sca-
lar spectrum. Five laminar and 11 turbulent cases were investigated
by varying (i) the amplitude ðZ02 Þ1=2=Z of the mixture-fraction fluctu-
ations from 0 to 0.3 and (ii) a ratio of u0=SLðF 1⁄4 0:8Þ from 0 to 2.67.
Moreover, the Taylor microscale λ was varied by 40% in the turbulent
cases. Accordingly, the microscale Reynolds number Reλ 1⁄4 u0λ=nu
was varied from 16 to 58 in those 11 cases. Combustion chemistry
was reduced to a single irreversible reaction between a generic fuel
and oxygen.

PGrout et al. [213] performed a 3D DNS study of a single stratified
methane(cid:1)air flame (0.4 (cid:2) F (cid:2) 1.2, F 1⁄4 0:74) that propagated in
weak (u0=SLðF 1⁄4 0:74Þ 1⁄4 0:7) turbulence. To mimic mixture inho-
mogeneities, fluctuations in F were imposed, with particular
emphasis being placed on initializing the velocity and scalar fields in
a consistent manner. For this purpose, a laminar flame was embed-
ded into a quiescent gas, followed by the propagation of the flame

Ptowards inhomogeneous turbulent flow that entered the computa-
tional domain through the inlet boundary. Combustion chemistry
was modeled invoking a two-step reduced mechanism.

PMalkeson and Chakraborty [214(cid:1)222] and Malkeson et al. [223]
performed a 3D DNS study of four statistically planar stratified
flames that propagated in temporally decaying small-scale turbu-
lence, with a ratio of u0/SL being substantially larger than unity
at t 1⁄4 0. Inhomogeneities of the composition of reactants were
prescribed using a pseudo-spectral method, with (i) a bimodal
PDF P(F), (ii) mean F 1⁄4 0:7 or 1.0, (iii) rms 1⁄2ðF(cid:1)FÞ2 (cid:8)1=2 1⁄4 0:6; and
(iv) an integral length scale LF 1⁄4 2:2L of spatial variations in F being
specified. Combustion chemistry was reduced to a single irreversible
reaction between a generic fuel and oxygen.

PIn the cited papers, various approaches developed for modeling
premixed or non-premixed turbulent combustion were assessed
using the DNS data obtained from the four stratified flames. In
particular, statistics and models of the following quantities were
addressed;

PHesse et al. [224] performed a 3D DNS study of open oblique
flames that propagated to lean and rich reactants in small-scale tur-
bulence. A rich mixture was supplied through a rectangular slot and
was enveloped by a slower co-flow of a lean mixture. The reactants
were locally ignited in a single point in the mixing layer. Combustion
chemistry was reduced to a single irreversible reaction between a
generic fuel and oxygen. The focus of the study was placed on statis-
tics of the local displacement speed Sd.

PIn order to study behavior of (i) dissipation rates xc

; and xY;Z
and (ii) PDFs P(c), P(Z), and P(|rc|, |rZ|) in partially premixed flames,
Ruan et al. [225] processed 3D DNS data obtained by Mizobuchi
[226,227] from a highly turbulent hydrogen lifted jet flame. In those
DNS, a detail chemical mechanism consisting of 9 species and 17
reactions was invoked. The DNS data were analyzed at three differ-
ent distances from the jet nozzle. At the smallest distance (5.75 noz-
zle diameters), computed dependencies of
local mass rate of
hydrogen consumption or mole fractions of OH and H2O on the local
temperature were close to the counterpart dependencies calculated
for laminar premixed flames characterized with the local F. Accord-
ingly, at this distance, combustion mode is clearly associated with
inhomogeneously premixed burning and, therefore, the reported
results are of interest for developing models of stratified turbulent
flames.

PRamaekers et al. [228] performed a 3D DNS study of three open,
weakly turbulent (u0=SL 1⁄4 1:6), stratified Bunsen flames stabilized at
the exit of a rectangular channel. Stratification of the composition of
preheated (Tu 1⁄4 800 K) methane(cid:1)air mixture was simulated by
imposing periodic 1D spatial variations in F at the burner nozzle,
with two different amplitudes and two different wavelengths of
these periodic variations being addressed. Combustion chemistry
was modeled using Flamelet Generated Manifold (FGM) method
[229,230]. The focus of that study was placed on assessing the appli-
cability of FSD approach, developed for premixed combustion
[23,66], to LES of stratified flames. Ramaekers et al. [228] did not
observed any effect of the imposed large-scale spatial variations in
F on the local flame structure.

PPera et al. [231] performed a 2D DNS study of the influence of tem-
perature and mixture composition fluctuations on the growth of a
small flame kernel in the stoichiometric isooctane/air mixture under
elevated temperatures and pressures associated with combustion in
a conventional SI engine under low loads. Both laminar and weakly
“turbulent” (a narrow spectrum of velocity fluctuations, Ret 1⁄4 22)
conditions were simulated, with the turbulence decaying. It is worth

Pstressing that, in order to mimic the influence of EGR on the flame-
kernel growth, the mean mixture composition was homogeneous,
but fluctuations in local mixture composition and temperature “were
generated with a prescribed amplitude and a characteristic size”, which
was equal to the integral length scale of the velocity fluctuations [231].
The computations were performed using a semi-detailed chemical
mechanism that contained 29 species and 48 reactions.

PRichardson and Chen [232] performed a 3D DNS study of three
open stratified Bunsen flames stabilized in small-scale turbulent
flow at the exit of a rectangular channel. Stratification of the compo-
sition of preheated (Tu 1⁄4 800 K) lean (0.41 (cid:2) F (cid:2) 1.0) methane(cid:1)air
mixture was simulated by imposing 1D spatial variations in the
equivalence ratio at the burner nozzle, with the local gradient of F
being either tangential to a c isosurface (flame C2) or normal to it
(flames C4 and C5). In the case of the normal stratification, F was
higher either in the products (flame C4) or in the reactants (flame
C5). The computations were performed using a reduced chemical
mechanism that contained 13 species and 9 steps.

PRecently, Proch et al. [98,99] reported results of a “flame-resolved
simulation” of a single lean methane(cid:1)air flame, which was experi-
mentally investigated [179,182] using the Cambridge swirl burner,
but without swirl. In the numerical study, combustion chemistry
was tabulated by applying the FGM techniques [229,230] to data
computed from 1D planar laminar flames. Those data were obtained
by using GRI-3.0 chemical mechanism [203] and by setting Lek 1⁄4 1
for all species. The major difference between the discussed flame-
resolved simulation and a DNS consists of different resolutions of
the smallest eddies in unburned gas and flame preheat zone. In the
former case, a ratio of grid resolution to the Kolmogorov length scale
reached values up to four and three at c < 0.02 and 0.02 < c < 0.6,
respectively. On the contrary, in the reaction zone (0.6 < c < 0.8)
and products (0.8 < c), the Kolmogorov eddies were well resolved,
because the Kolmogorov length scale was increased due to an
increase in the molecular viscosity with the temperature. As far as
the fields of c(x, t) and Z(x, t) are concerned (these fields characterize
the state of the mixture within the framework of the FGM approach),
they were well resolved, thus, making the simulation “flame-
resolved”.

PAn impressive quantitative agreement between the simulation
results and the experimental data was obtained for the radial pro-
files of the mean radial velocity, temperature, equivalence ratio, CO
mass fraction, and their rms values, measured at different distances
from the nozzle [98]. Moreover, Proch et al. [98] reported a large
amount of numerical data on (i) strain rates normal and tangential
to the local flame, (ii) angles between the normal vector n and local
eigenvectors of the rate-of-strain tensor, (iii) local curvature k, (iv)
local FSD |rc|, (v) local displacement speed Sd, (vi) joint PDFs for k or
|rc| and the tangential strain rate or Sd, etc., with all these numerical
data being conditioned on five different ranges of the local c(x, t).
While the simulated case was premixed, i.e. two flows of reactants
had the same F 1⁄4 0:75 at the nozzle, mixture stratification was gen-
erated due to entrainment of surrounding air at larger distances
from the nozzle. While this effect was studied in the simulation,
Proch et al. [98] did not find a significant influence is this mixture
stratification on the investigated flame characteristics.

4.1. Back-supported combustion

PIf a stratified laminar flame propagates from a stoichiometric to
a lean mixture, then, such a combustion can be described as back-
supported. Indeed, due to an increase in the equivalence ratio F
behind the flame, the adiabatic combustion temperature Tb(F) also
increases in the products with distance from the flame, see red solid
line in Fig. 3. Consequently, there is an extra heat flux from the

lines) laminar flames.

Pproducts to the reaction zone when compared to the case of a homo-
geneous mixture, see black dashed line in Fig. 3. Moreover, due to a
higher concentration of radicals, e.g. OH, in the stratified products,
radical fluxes from the reaction zone to the products are lower than
in the case of a homogeneous mixture. Therefore, the temperature T
[F(x)], radical concentrations, and HRR _vc1⁄2FðxÞ(cid:8) in the reaction zone
of the stratified flame are higher than the temperature T(F0), radical
concentrations, and HRR _vcðF0Þ in the reaction zone of the homoge-
neous flame even if the local equivalence ratios are approximately
the same in the two reaction zones. As a result, the speed SL[F(x)] of
the stratified flame is higher and the lean flammability limit is
extended. Both the increase in the local combustion rate and the
extension of flammability limits due to the back support have been
documented in experimental and numerical investigations of lami-
nar stratified flames, as well as in experimental studies of turbulent
stratified flames.

P4.1.1. Experiments with laminar flames

PBy experimentally investigating the influence of mixture stratifi-
cation on expansion of spherical laminar methane(cid:1)air flames in a
confined vessel, Ra and Cheng [148] found that relaxation of the
measured flame speed from a higher value9 SL(Fi) to a lower value
SL(F0) was sufficiently slow and took a longer time interval when
the difference in SL(Fi) and SL(F0) was larger. To explain they exper-
imental findings, Ra and Cheng [148] performed unsteady 1D simu-
lations of stratified flame propagation using a reduced chemical
mechanism of methane(cid:1)air combustion and attributed the findings
to “back-support”, i.e. “the heat and radicals transfers from the
burned region behind the flame front”.

PA sufficiently slow relaxation of the local flame speed from a
higher value SL(Fi (cid:3) 0.79) to a lower value SLðF0 1⁄4 0:6Þ was also
documented in a recent experimental study [156] of expanding
stratified laminar propane(cid:1)air flames in three different cases; (C1)
Fi 1⁄4 1:24 § 0:06; (C2) Fi 1⁄4 0:95 § 0:06; and (C3) Fi 1⁄4 0:79 § 0:03.
The relaxation took a longer time interval when Fi was larger, see
Fig. 4. Moreover, sensitivity of the local flame speed to the local
stretch rate was reduced when increasing Fi. These results were
interpreted to indicate the back-supported combustion.

PIn line with the concept of back-supported combustion, an
increase in the temperature behind an oblique flame propagating to
a leaner methane-air mixture was documented by Degardin et al.
[154] in experiments with stratified V-shaped laminar flames. More-
over, obtained dependencies of the thermal laminar flame thickness
DL 1⁄4 ðTb (cid:1)TuÞ= maxfj r Tjg on the local mole fraction XCH4 of meth-
ane were significantly smoother than in the counterpart premixed
flames, cf. stars with other symbols in Fig. 5. It is also worth noting
that squares, circles, and triangles in Fig. 5 indicate substantial

the fresh gases. From the paper by Degardin et al. [154] (cid:1)2014 by Springer, repro-

Pextension of the lean-flammability limit, again in line with the
concept of back-supported combustion.

PGalizzi and Escudi(cid:3)e [155] noted “the support of flame propaga-

tion by parallel equivalence ratio gradient”.

PBy experimentally studying propagation of

laminar flames
through steadily stratified either lean or rich methane-air mixtures,
Kang and Kyritsis [151(cid:1)153] have shown that the flame speeds
SL(F) obtained from stratified mixtures, e.g. see open symbols in
Fig. 6, are typically10 higher than the speeds of premixed flames
characterized by the same F, see filled symbols. The effect is more
pronounced if |dF/dx| is higher, cf. squares and triangles associated
with jdF=dxj 1⁄4 3:2 and 3.8 m(cid:1)1; respectively. In particular, near
the rich flammability limit associated with the homogeneous mix-
ture (F 1⁄4 1:36), the stratified flame speed may be higher than the

characterizes homogeneous unburned reactants at a long distance from the kernel.

10 Fig. 5a in Ref. [153] indicates that, in the case of weak stratification, the stratified
flame speed may be both higher and lower than the homogeneous SL evaluated at the
same F.

Fig. 6. Laminar flame speeds obtained by Kang and Kyritsis [153] from stratified
(open symbols) methane(cid:1)air mixtures in two cases; 1 - F 1⁄4 1:2 þ 3:2ðx(cid:1)0:05Þ and 2
- F 1⁄4 1:37 þ 3:8ðx(cid:1)0:05Þ; where x is measured in meters. Filled symbols show speeds
of homogeneously premixed laminar flames characterized by the equivalence ratio
equal to F(x) obtained in the two stratified cases.

Pcounterpart (the same F) homogeneous SL by a factor of about three,
cf. open and filled triangles at x (cid:4) 0.05 m in Fig. 6. In a lean mixture,
“flames in the stratified medium can reach speeds up to a factor of
two higher than the laminar flame speed corresponding to the local
equivalence ratio” [152].

PMoreover, under conditions of those experiments, back-sup-
ported stratified flames sustained themselves in very lean or very
rich mixtures, whose composition was well beyond the flammability
limits of the homogeneous methane-air mixture under the same
temperature and the same pressure. For instance, open triangles in
Fig. 6 show that a laminar flame propagates through a stratified rich
mixture even if F > 1.36 (x (cid:3) 0.05 m), whereas a homogeneous mix-
ture is flammable if F < 1.36 [153]. In the lean case, the stratified
flame propagated at F as low as 0.35 [152].

PKang and Kyritsis [152,153] attributed the aforementioned
experimental findings to the back support of stratified flame propa-
gation by heat flux from products whose composition was more
close to the stoichiometry and whose temperature was, therefore,
higher. Subsequently, Kang and Kyritsis [233] extended the classical
theory of laminar premixed flame [234] by assuming “that composi-
tional stratification is equivalent to spatially varying adiabatic flame
temperature” and showed that the use of the local equivalence ratio
was insufficient in order to quantitatively predict the speed of a
stratified flame. Quantitative agreement between the theoretical
and experimental [152,153] results was significantly improved by
accounting for the history of stratified flame propagation. However,
this method involved “a curve-fitting parameter” that was “specific
to the particular combustion configuration” [233]. Accordingly, the
present author is not aware on the use of the cited theoretical results
when modeling stratified combustion.

PIt is worth also stressing that the data by Kang and Kyritsis [152]
imply that the knowledge of the local values of the equivalence ratio
and its spatial gradient is not sufficient to quantify stratified flame
speeds. Indeed, filled circle in Fig. 7 indicates that approximately the
same SL (cid:4) 0.15 m/s may be obtained at approximately the same F (cid:4)
0.55, but two different spatial gradients of the equivalence ratio, i.e. j
dF=dxj 1⁄4 10 and 12.5 m(cid:1)1; see dashed line with squares and dotted-
dashed line with diamonds, respectively.

P4.1.2. Simulations of laminar flames

PThe back-supported stratified combustion was also investigated
in numerical studies of 1D laminar methane(cid:1)air flames by invoking
complex combustion chemistry [200,201,205(cid:1)207].

PMarzouk et al. [200] addressed methane(cid:1)air flames stabilized in
the PTR stagnation-point configuration, see Fig. 1a, with the product
equivalence ratio Fp being equal to or larger than 0.3 (cid:2) Fr (cid:2) 1.0 in
the reactants. In all steady cases characterized by Fr < Fp (cid:2) 1,

legends.

Pcomputed HRR was higher than in the case of the same Fr and
Fp 1⁄4 Fr; with the flux of OH radicals from the products contribut-
ing more to this effect than the heat flux. Moreover, extension of
the lean flammability limit was reported in the case of the back
support (Fr < Fp (cid:2) 1). An increase in HRR and extension of
the lean flammability limit were also studied by reducing Fr(t)
from Frðt 1⁄4 0Þ 1⁄4 Fp 1⁄4 1:0 to 0.3 and setting various rates of the
decrease in Fr(t) [200].

PPirez da Cruz et al. [201] simulated propagation of an adiabatic
flame subject to a spatial gradient of F. In order to characterize
the instantaneous mixture composition,
the equivalence ratio
F*(t) evaluated “at the point of maximum heat release” was used.
Subsequently, results computed at each instant t were compared
with results obtained in the homogeneous cases characterized by
F 1⁄4 F(cid:9)
ðtÞ; i.e. at two different instants, two different reference cases
were chosen.

PWhen Fðx; t 1⁄4 0Þ was decreased from unity to 0.35 (this value
is below the lean flammability limit), both an increase in the local
SL[F*(t)] when compared to the homogeneous case characterized
by F 1⁄4 F(cid:9)
ðtÞ and an extension of the lean flammability limit was
documented, with the effects being attributed to an increase in
the local temperature and mass fractions of H and H2 due to the
back support from the stoichiometric products. When Fðx; t 1⁄4 0Þ
was decreased from 1.5 to 1.0, the stratified SL[F*(t)] was also
higher than the counterpart homogeneous SL, with the effect
being attributed to an increase in the local concentrations of H
and H2 in the stratified case due to the flux of unburned H2 from
richer products, see Fig. 8. However, when Fðx; t 1⁄4 0Þ was
increased from 1.0 to 2.5, SL[F*(t)] was lower than the counter-
part homogeneous SL. The effect was attributed [201] to a signifi-
cantly higher concentration of H2 in the reaction zone of the
homogeneous flame due to a stronger (weaker) flux of unburned
hydrogen from richer (leaner) products in the homogeneous
(stratified) case, respectively.

PRichardson et al. [205] simulated steady stratified combustion of
methane(cid:1)air mixtures in the PTR stagnation-point configuration,
see Fig. 1a, with both back (Fr < Fp < 1) and front (Fp < Fr < 1)
supported flames being addressed. In the former (latter) case, HRR
was higher (lower) than in the counterpart premixed flame provided
that the local equivalence ratios F* evaluated at the peak heat
release were the same in the stratified and premixed flames. This
effect was attributed to local changes in concentrations of highly
reactive species (H, H2, and OH) due the radical fluxes from (to)
richer (leaner) products, whereas the heat flux from (to) the prod-
ucts played a secondary role. Due to such local changes in the radical
concentrations, knowledge of the local values of F and combustion
progress variable c is insufficient to evaluate the local HRR, i.e.
dependencies _vcðc; FÞ obtained from the stratified and premixed
laminar flames were different, see Fig. 5b in Ref. [205]

PSecond,

in the cases of the same maxfj r xujg 1⁄4 50 s(cid:1)1; but
(i) Fr 1⁄4 0:54 and Fp 1⁄4 0:44; (ii) Fr 1⁄4 Fp 1⁄4 0:50; and (iii) Fr 1⁄4 0:4
and Fp 1⁄4 0:70; the reaction zones were subject to negative, vanish-
ing, and positive gradient of F, evaluated in direction from reactants
to products, with the local equivalence ratio F(cid:9)
1⁄4 0:5 being the
same at the peak heat release in all three cases. The highest HRR
was obtained from the back-supported flame (iii), with the effect
being attributed to the heat flux from richer combustion products.
The lowest HRR was obtained from flame (i), i.e. the front support
did not enhance heat release in this lean case.

PThird,

in the cases of the same maxfj r xujg 1⁄4 50 s(cid:1)1 and
(i) Fr 1⁄4 1:59; Fp 1⁄4 1:20; and F(cid:9)
1⁄4 1:50; (ii) Fr 1⁄4 Fp 1⁄4 1:50; and
(iii) Fr 1⁄4 1:46; Fp 1⁄4 1:90; and F(cid:9)
1⁄4 1:50; the highest HRR was
obtained from (iii), with the effect being attributed to species fluxes
from richer combustion products, in particular, to the diffusion flux
of H2, cf. black solid lines in Fig. 9a, b, and c. Thus, in this case, com-
bustion was back-supported due to the diffusion flux of H2. The low-
est HRR was obtained from flame (i).

PMoreover, Zhou and Hochgreb [207] simulated back-supported
lean flames characterized by various F* < 1 and either (i) various
Fp/Fr, but the same gradient |rF|* within the heat-release zone or
(ii) various |rF|*, but the same Fp/Fr. Such simulations were per-
formed at three strain rates, maxfj r xujg 1⁄4 50; 300, and 500 s(cid:1)1. In
these computations, the peak heat-release rate Q normalized using
the counterpart quantity obtained from the premixed flame charac-
terized by the same F* was larger than unity and was increased
either (i) by |rF|* or (ii) by Fp/Fr, respectively.

PAs far as the extension of flammability limits (0.45 < F < 1.90
under conditions of the cited study) due to mixture stratification is
concerned, combustion at F* < 0.45 or F* > 1.90 was computed
not only in the case of Fr 1⁄4 0:10 and Fp 1⁄4 0:50 or Fr 1⁄4 1:90
and Fp 1⁄4 2:15; but also in the case of Fr 1⁄4 0:50 and Fp 1⁄4 0:35
or Fr 1⁄4 2:10 and Fp 1⁄4 1:90; see Table 4 and Fig. 15 in [207].

PFinally, the simulations by Zhou and Hochgreb [207] have shown
that the peak scalar dissipation rate depends linearly on the peak
HRR at maxfj r xujg 1⁄4 50; 300, or 500 s(cid:1)1; with data obtained from
premixed and stratified flames collapsing to the same straight line at
each strain rate, see Fig. 20 in the cited paper.

PIn the case of

lean stratified hydrogen(cid:1)air mixtures and
rF ¢ rc > 0, Shi et al. [208] computed a higher local fuel consump-
tion velocity than in the homogeneous mixture characterized with
the same F*, cf. lines with symbols at F < 1.0 in Fig. 10. Thus, com-
bustion was back-supported in such a lean case. The opposite effect
was simulated in the case of rF ¢ rc < 0, i.e. when the flame propa-
gated from a lean to a rich mixture. The magnitudes of both effects
were increased by the local |rF|, e.g. cf. lines in Fig. 10, and were
shown to be mainly controlled by the local variations in the mole

Fig. 8. Profiles of temperature and mole fractions of H2 and H, computed by Pires da
Cruz et al. [201] for premixed (solid lines) and stratified (dashed lines) flames, with
the latter flame propagating from rich to stoichiometric methane(cid:1)air mixtures. In
both cases, peak HRR is calculated at F(cid:9)
1⁄4 1:3. From the paper by Pirez da Cruz et al.
[201] (cid:1)2000 by the Combustion Institute, reproduced with permission.

PResults obtained by Coriton et al. [206] by simulating a similar
PTR flame configuration show that a lean stratified flame is abruptly
quenched by a relatively low strain rate if Fp 1⁄4 1:0 or the hot stream
contains N2 only, but the flame can sustain itself at significantly
higher strain rates if the composition of the hot stream corresponds
to lean products. The effect was attributed to an excess of oxidizing
species such as O2 in the hot stream, thus, clearly indicating an
importance of combustion chemistry and molecular diffusion in the
products for predicting extinction of stratified flames.

PZhou and Hochgreb [207] also simulated stratified combustion of
methane(cid:1)air mixtures in the PTR stagnation-point configuration
with Fr 61⁄4 Fp. Depending on the set values of Fr and Fp, different
effects were computed. First, in the cases of a low strain rate
maxfj r xujg 1⁄4 50 s(cid:1)1 and (i) Fr 1⁄4 0:6 and Fp 1⁄4 0:9 when compared
to Fr 1⁄4 Fp 1⁄4 0:6 or (ii) Fr 1⁄4 0:9 and Fp 1⁄4 0:6 when compared to
Fr 1⁄4 Fp 1⁄4 0:6; the stratification did not affect combustion, because
the flame was stabilized in the lean reactants where F 1⁄4 Fr.

Pfraction of H (“chemical effect”) due to its high diffusivity. For
instance, such effects were not observed in the case of Lek 1⁄4 1 for all
species.

PShi et al. [208] have also noted that “no significant lean flamma-
bility extension is observed” under conditions of their simulations.
More precisely, Shi et al. [208] did not determine a lean flammability
limit. By referring to old experimental data, they considered
F(cid:9)
1⁄4 0:356 to be the lean flammability limit in the premixed case.
Moreover, they found that, in the vicinity of the heat-release zone,
spatial profiles of the mole fraction of H2, O2, H2O, OH, or H were
very close to one another in the following two cases; (i) premixed
combustion at F(cid:9)
1⁄4 0:356 and (ii) back-supported stratified com-
bustion at F(cid:9)
1⁄4 0:346. Spatial profiles of the rates of heat release in
the most important reactions were also close in the two cases.
Accordingly, Shi et al. [208] considered F(cid:9)
1⁄4 0:346 to be the lean
flammability limit in the stratified case. A result that difference in
F(cid:9)
1⁄4 0:346; associated with the same spatial pro-
files in the homogeneous and stratified cases, respectively, is small
could be attributed to rapidly (when compared to slow propagation
of near-limit flames) smearing the mixture inhomogeneities due to
molecular diffusion in the latter case [208].

1⁄4 0:356 and F(cid:9)

PIn addition to the aforementioned studies of laminar premixed
flames subject to spatial inhomogeneities of the mixture composi-
tion, response of strained premixed laminar flames to temporal
oscillations of the equivalence ratio was also studied by (i) simulat-
ing two identical opposed propane(cid:1)air [199] or methane(cid:1)air
[202,204,205,207] flames in the RTR counterflow configuration
and (ii) imposing periodic temporal oscillations of F at the inlet
boundary. In such cases, the instantaneous mixture composition
was spatially uniform at the initial instant t 1⁄4 0; but was non-
uniform at t > 0 due to a finite time tc required for a gas volume to
move from the inlet boundary to the flame.

PLauvergne and Egolfopoulos [199] and Sankaran and Im [202]
have shown that the time-dependence of the burning rate is sensi-
tive to the frequency of the oscillations of F(t) at the inlet, e.g. see
Fig. 11a and c. Moreover, the latter authors have stressed that the
“flame can actually sustain itself, even if the equivalence ratio falls
far below the steady flammability limit” [202], with the equivalence
ratio Fu being locally evaluated at temperature T 1⁄4 302 K. It is also
worth noting that the largest difference between the instantaneous
and steady lean flammability limits Fu was obtained by Sankaran
and Im [202] at an intermediate frequency f 1⁄4 400 Hz of the

Fig. 11. Dependencies of the total fuel consumption rate on oscillating (a) and (c)

point of the peak fuel consumption rate, computed by Lauvergne and Egolfopoulos
[199]. A is the amplitude of oscillations of the inlet equivalence ratio, K 1⁄4 maxf

Poscillations, whereas too fast (1000 Hz) or too slow (10 Hz) oscilla-
tions weakly affected the limit.

PLauvergne and Egolfopoulos [199] have stressed that response of
a RTR flame to oscillations of F at the inlet is substantially attenu-
ated due to molecular diffusion if the oscillation frequency is suffi-
ciently high, i.e. if time 1/f is significantly shorter than “the time that
is required for a perturbation to propagate through a flame layer”.
Accordingly, Lauvergne and Egolfopoulos [199] (i) have proposed to
characterize local mixture composition within the flame using the
equivalence ratio F* evaluated locally at the point of the peak fuel
consumption rate and (ii) have shown that computed dependencies
of the total fuel consumption rate on F* are weakly affected by the
oscillations of F(t), cf. Fig. 11b and d with Fig. 11a and c, respec-
tively. Therefore, Lauvergne and Egolfopoulos [199] have concluded
that “instantaneous flame properties ... can be derived from the time
history of the flame and through the use of the steady flamelets
libraries” [199] computed in premixed cases using the equivalence
ratios equal to F*(t).

PLauvergne and Egolfopoulos [199] have also shown that flame
extinction due to a low local equivalence ratio is controlled by the
local conditions within the layer of the main branching reaction
[199]. Sankaran and Im [202] have also noted that the local extinc-
tion is “primarily determined by the instantaneous branching-termi-
nation balance at the reaction zone”.

PZhou and Hochgreb [207] have drawn a conclusion that “the heat
release rate is primarily a function of” F* and |rF|*, “with insignifi-
cant unsteady effects” at f 1⁄4 50 Hz.

PK€onig et al. [204] have shown that spatial variations in F are
weakly pronounced in the vicinity of the reaction zone if the oscilla-
tion frequency is either too low (e.g. f 1⁄4 20 Hz) or too high (e.g.
f 1⁄4 1000 Hz). In the former case, the aforementioned convection
time tc is much less than the period of the oscillations and the com-
position of unburned mixture is spatially uniform. In the latter case,
the oscillations are rapidly dissipated as a fluid particle moves from
the inlet boundary to the flame [204].

PThe numerical results cited above appear to be consistent with
recent experimental data by Ax and Meier [157], which indicate that

POH*-chemiluminescence and, thus, heat release at the tip of a lami-
lean methane-air, Bunsen flame well follow low-frequency
nar,
(5(cid:1)50 Hz) oscillations in the inlet equivalence ratio. However, Ax
and Meier [157] have also reported a phase lag between oscillations
in mole fractions of CH4 and H2, measured 4 mm upstream of the
flame tip. Therefore, even in this case, knowledge of the local F
does not seem to be sufficient in order to describe the local flame
structure.

PAll in all, the above review of results of simulations of (i) simple
laminar flames subject to spatial inhomogeneities of mixture compo-
sition and (ii) counterflow laminar flames subject to temporal oscilla-
tions of the inlet equivalence ratio implies that burning rate and
flammability limits are stronger affected by the spatial variations of
F in the former case than by temporal oscillations of the inlet equiva-
lence ratio in the latter case. It is worth remembering, however, that
such a conclusion could be limited to investigated flame configura-
tions, large magnitudes of the spatial variations of F in case (i), the
lack of oscillations in the direction of rF in case (i), etc.

P4.1.3. Turbulent flames

PBy simultaneously measuring the local flame speeds and local
equivalence ratios, Pasquier et al. [168] documented “an enhance-
ment of flame propagation thanks to the large-scale” stratification of
propane(cid:1)air mixture in a constant volume chamber when compared
to the homogeneous case. Moreover, in the stratified cases, the mea-
sured PDFs of local flame speed were shifted to higher values of Sd
than in the counterpart premixed cases. In particular, the mean local
flame speed conditioned to F 1⁄4 0:8 was equal to 0.5 m/s at 1 ms
after spark ignition, whereas the counterpart flame speed was equal
to 0.4 m/s in the homogeneous case (F 1⁄4 0:8). Pasquier et al. [168]
concluded that their experimental data confirmed numerical results
by Pires da Cruz [201], see the previous subsection.

PExperiments by Coriton et al. [186(cid:1)188], which were already dis-
cussed in Section 3.1.2, showed significant influence of mixture
stratification on (i) diffusion of OH radicals in combustion products
and, therefore, (ii) flame resistance to local quenching due to high
turbulent stretch rate. These findings appear to be consistent with
the concept of back-supported burning.

PSweeney et al. [179,180] did not observe an extension of the lean
flammability limit in their experiments with globally lean stratified
turbulent flames stabilized using the Cambridge swirl burner. Never-
theless, Sweeney et al. [179(cid:1)181] have reported that stratification
increases mass fractions of CO and H2 conditioned to the local tem-
perature, i.e. hYCO|T i and hYH2|T i, respectively, but weakly affects the
conditioned mass fractions of CH4, O2, CO2, and H2O. In non-swirling
flows, the influence of stratification on hYCO|T i and hYH2|T i is only
observed at high T [179], but the effect is pronounced even at low
T in swirling flows [180,181]. Conditioned gradients h|rT| |T i and
h|rc| |T i are also enhanced by stratification, with the effect being
increased by the stratification level [181].

PSubsequently, Kamal et al. [183] reported joint PDFs for T and
mass fractions of the aforementioned species, with the PDFs being
(i) conditioned to the local equivalence ratio and (ii) measured at dif-
ferent distances from flame-holder. In line with the previous studies
[179(cid:1)181], the doubly-conditioned mass fractions hYCO|T, F i and
hYH2|T, F i in the preheat zone of a stratified flame are larger than the
values of YCO(T, F) and YH2(T, F), respectively, obtained by simulat-
ing the counterpart laminar premixed flame, i.e. a premixed flame
characterized by F that the data measured in the stratified flame are
conditioned to. However, the difference between hYCO|T, F i and
YCO(T, F) or hYH2|T, F i and YH2(T, F) “is relatively minor, suggesting
that the flame micro-structure is largely controlled by the local stoi-
chiometry, with only minor effects of strain and stratification” [183].
Swirl increases the aforementioned difference, but does not change
the cited conclusion [184]. No effect of stratification on doubly con-
ditioned FSD h|rc| |T, F i and scalar dissipation rate hxc|T, F i were

Pfound by Kamal et al. [183] when comparing data obtained at the
same local F.

PBy investigating small regions within stratified weakly turbulent
(0.5 < u0/SL < 1.1) V-shaped flames, Vena et al. [190,191] reported (i)
a decrease in the mean local HRR with increasing positive r yF in
near-stoichiometric (0:95(cid:2)F(cid:2)1:05) regions, with the effect magni-
tude being about 3.5% at the highest r yF 1⁄4 29 m(cid:1)1; (ii) a decrease
in the mean local HRR with increasing positive r yF in rich
(1:15(cid:2)F(cid:2)1:25) regions, with the effect magnitude being about 5.2%,
but (iii) an increase in the mean local HRR by the magnitude of the
negative r yF in the rich regions, with the effect magnitude being
about 10.1% at r yF 1⁄4 (cid:1)14 m(cid:1)1; and (iv) an increase in the mean
local HRR by positive r yF in lean (0:85(cid:2)F(cid:2)0:95) regions, with the
effect magnitude being about 3.8% at the highest r yF 1⁄4 24 m(cid:1)1.
Because the products (reactants) were richer (leaner) in the case of a
positive r yF; trend (iv) is well associated with the back support.
Trend (iii) might also be attributed to back support, e.g. due to heat
flux from the products to the reaction zone.

PVena et al. [191] did not emphasize a notable effect of mixture
stratification on the dependence of the local HRR on the local flame
curvature. Nevertheless, they noted that experimental data obtained
from the rich regions indicated that an increase in the magnitude of
the negative r yF; resulted in increasing peak HRR in reaction zones
characterized by the negative local curvature, see Fig. 5a in the cited
paper.

PExperimental data reviewed in the present subsection appear
to be somehow controversial and do not allow us to draw solid
conclusions regarding (i) conditions under that the back support can
significantly affect characteristics of stratified turbulent flames and
(ii) turbulent combustion characteristics that are most susceptible to
such effects. For instance, as pointed out by a reviewer, a role played
by the back support in stratified turbulent flames may depend on
u0/SL, presence of mean shear, etc. Further research into these issues
is definitely required.

PDNS data obtained by Richardson and Chen [232] in case C2 of
tangential stratification with respect to the mean flame brush indi-
cate, see Fig. 12, that the displacement speed of a locally back-
supported (dξ/dn < 0) reaction surface cðx; tÞ 1⁄4 0:65 is statistically
higher than the speed of the front-supported (dξ/dn > 0) surface.
Moreover, the cross-dissipation rate hDrZrc|Z i conditioned to
the local value of a mixture fraction Z is positive (negative) at
locally back-supported
indicating that
lower (higher) Z,

P(front-supported) burning statistically dominates in leaner (richer)
mixture, respectively.

PIn addition to these locally conditioned results obtained in case
C2, Richardson and Chen [232] also compared mean flame charac-
teristics computed at various distances x from the nozzle of a
Bunsen burner in cases C4 and C5, associated with back-supported
and front-supported, respectively, stratification with respect to
the mean flame brush. They found that a “burning intensity”
IðxÞ 1⁄4 ruðFÞUt =fdA 1⁄2ruðFÞSLðFÞ(cid:8)f g was significantly higher in the
globally back-supported flame C4 than in the globally front-sup-
ported flame C5. Here, ruðFÞUt is the mass burning rate averaged
over the transverse plane at a distance x from the nozzle, dAðxÞ is a
mean increase in the flame surface area when compared to the lami-
nar case, averaged over the same plane, and the consumption rate
1⁄2ruðFÞSLðFÞ(cid:8)f is determined (i) using results of simulations of a lami-
nar premixed flame characterized by the equivalence ratio equal to
F(x, y, z) evaluated locally in the reaction zone of the turbulent strat-
ified flame and (ii) averaging the obtained data on ru(F)SL(F) over
the same transverse plane, i.e. over y and z. Thus, these DNS data
appear to indicate a substantial effect of mixture stratification on the
local burning rate.

P4.1.4. Summary

PA significant role played by the back support in stratified laminar
flames has been shown in a number of experimental and numerical
studies. Due to the back support, local heat release rate may be
increased in such flames and flammability limits may be extended.
These phenomena stem not only from the heat flux to the reaction
zone from the combustion products, but also from the molecular
transport of active species between the products, reaction and pre-
heat zones [174,186,201,205(cid:1)208], with differences in molecular
diffusivities of the species playing a role.

PAccordingly, the back support, at least in part, appears to be mani-
festation of preferential diffusion effects. Another manifestation of
such effects is well known to consist of significant local variations
in the burning rate in curved and strained (stretched) premixed
flames, with such variations playing an important role not only
in laminar, but also in highly turbulent premixed combustion
[21,24,64,235,236]. Therefore, research into interaction between the
former (stratification-induced) and latter (stretch-induced) preferen-
tial diffusion effects in inhomogeneously premixed flames appears to
be of great interest, but the present author is not aware on such a
study. Such an interaction may be of paramount importance if strati-
fied turbulent burning rate is controlled by characteristics of highly
stretched inherently laminar reaction zones that advance the furthest
into unburned gas, as hypothesized by the leading point concept of
premixed turbulent combustion. The reader interested in this concept
is referred to [21,24,64,134,135,234(cid:1)236].

PAs far as stratified turbulent flames are concerned, available
experimental data are controversial. A role played by the back sup-
port and conditions under that this role may be substantial definitely
require further research.

4.2. Generation of flame surface

PWhen a laminar flame propagates through a quiescent, spatially
uniform mixture, the flame surface is planar, as sketched in Fig. 13a.
However, if the mixture composition varies in space, then, different
elements of the flame move at different speeds and an initially pla-
nar flame becomes wrinkled, see Fig. 13b. Therefore, mixture inho-
mogeneities may increase the flame surface area. Accordingly, in a
turbulent flow, flame surface may grow not only due to turbulent
stretching, but also due to turbulent fluctuations in F.

PIt is worth noting, however, that an increase in the flame surface
area due to mixture inhomogeneities does not necessitate an
increase in the burning rate due to turbulent fluctuations in F. For

Fig. 13. Increase in the instantaneous flame surface due to the mixture inhomogene-
ity. (a) homogeneous case and (b) inhomogeneous case.

Pinstance, dashed lines in Fig. 14 show an initial position of a laminar
flame at instant t0 and subsequent position of the flame in a homo-
geneous case at instant t1, whereas solid lines show subsequent
positions of initially the same flames in two inhomogeneous cases.
Even if the lengths of the inhomogeneous flames are larger than the
length of the homogeneous flame in both cases, the latter flame con-
sumes (a) equal or (b) even larger amount of reactants than in the
inhomogeneous flames, cf. areas of brown and orange filled triangles
in Fig. 14a or see filled orange area in Fig. 14b, respectively. There-
fore, in two considered cases, an increase in flame surface area
due to mixture inhomogeneities is (a) counterbalanced or (b) over-
whelmed by a higher consumption velocity uc, i.e. burning rate per
unit flame surface area, in the homogeneous case.

PIn a turbulent flow, the overall effect of mixture inhomogeneities
on burning rate is controlled not only by an increase in the area of
the flame surface, but also by variations in uc, caused by variations in
the local equivalence ratio F(x, t) due to the inhomogeneities.
Accordingly, even if the mean flame surface area is increased by mix-
ture inhomogeneities, fluctuations in the equivalence ratio F (or
mixture fraction Z) may reduce the mean rate _vc of product creation
by decreasing the mean local consumption velocity ucðFÞ when
compared to the case of F02
1⁄4 Z02 1⁄4 0.

PVarious scenarios of the influence of F02

on ucðFÞ are sketched in
the simplest case of ucðFÞ 1⁄4 SLðFÞ in Fig. 15. If the mean value of the
equivalence ratio is equal to a value FSL;max associated with the peak
SL(F), see insert (a) where the mean F is shown in red circle, then,
both positive and negative fluctuations in the local F reduce the
local burning rate. Therefore, ucðFÞ is decreased with an increase in
F02 ; see solid curve.

Fig. 14. An increase in the flame surface due to mixture inhomogeneity may be
accompanied by (a) weak variations in overall burning rate or (b) even reduction in it.
The filled brown area shows reactants consumed by an inhomogeneous flame (solid

Pthe mean burning rate could be much more sensitive to the back
support in the vicinity of the leading points. The issue seems to
deserve a study.

P4.2.1. Experiments

PCho and Santavicca [158] reported that an increase in the magni-
tude of fluctuations in F in a globally stoichiometric propane(cid:1)air
mixture increased wrinkling of the surface of an expanding, statisti-
cally spherical, weakly turbulent (u0 1⁄4 0:25 m/s) flame kernel when
compared to the homogeneous case. Nevertheless, the fluctuations
=dt of the kernel with exception
weakly affected the growth rate dRf
of a single case characterized by the highest F02
and notably lower
=dt. Thus, under conditions of these experiments, the aforemen-
dRf
tioned decrease in ucðFÞ; see solid curved and insert (a) in Fig. 15,
appears to either counterbalance or overwhelm (in the case of the
highest F02
) the production of flame surface area due to mixture
inhomogeneities.

PSchlieren images obtained by Zhou et al. [159,160] from weakly
turbulent (u0 (cid:2) 0.289 m/s) flames expanding in a stratified propane(cid:1)
air mixture clearly show wrinkling of the flame front surface due to
mixture inhomogeneities. Accordingly, a substantial increase in the
observed turbulent flame speed dRf
=dt by the degree of the mixture
inhomogeneity was found in rich (F 1⁄4 1:6) and, especially, lean
(F 1⁄4 0:7) mixtures, see squares in Fig. 16. This increase in dRf
=dt is
associated with combustion acceleration due to production of
flame-surface area due to the mixture inhomogeneities, whereas the
influence of moderate fluctuations in the mixture composition on
ucðFÞ appears to be of minor importance in these two cases, because
positive and negative fluctuations counterbalance each other after
averaging, as sketched in Fig. 15, see the horizontal branch of dashed
curve and insert (d).

POn the contrary, in a near-stoichiometric mixture characterized
by F 1⁄4 1:1; both positive and negative fluctuations in F reduce
ucðFÞ; see solid curve and insert (a) in Fig. 15. Because this mecha-
nism appears to counterbalance the increase in the flamelet surface
area, the overall influence of the mixture inhomogeneities on the
normalized flame speed is weak, see stars in Fig. 16, provided that
the degree of the mixture inhomogeneity is sufficiently small. An
increase in the degree of the mixture inhomogeneity seems to make
the former effect (the decrease in uc) stronger and results in signifi-
cantly decreasing the flame speed, see the right star in Fig. 16.

PMoreover, magenta squares indicate that the same mechanism
(the decrease in uc) overwhelms the production of flame surface
area due to the mixture inhomogeneities also at F 1⁄4 1:6 if the
degree of the mixture inhomogeneity is sufficiently strong. This find-
ing is associated with a significant reduction in ucðFÞ due to an
increase in the probability of finding inflammable mixture, see
insert (b) in Fig. 15.

Fig. 16. Flame propagation speeds measured by Zhou et al. [159,160] at various
degrees of mixture inhomogeneity, various F specified in legends, and u0 1⁄4 0:13 m/s.
Flame speeds are normalized using their values obtained from the premixed flames
characterized by F 1⁄4 F.

Fig. 15. Effects of fluctuations of local mixture composition on a ratio of the mean
local consumption velocity ucðFÞ to the local consumption velocity ucðFÞ evaluated
at the mean local equivalence ratio F.

PIf F is significantly larger or lower than FSL;max and the ampli-
tude of fluctuations in F is so high that the probability of finding
very rich or very lean, respectively, inflammable mixture is signifi-
cant, see inserts (b) and (c), respectively, where the flammability
limits are shown in red crosses, then, an increase in F02
reduces
ucðFÞ; see dashed curve in the range of large F02 ; due to an increase
in the probability of vanishing local burning rate.

PIf the amplitude of fluctuations in F is sufficiently small and the
mean F is sufficiently far from both FSL;max and the flammability
limits, see insert (d), then, the dependence of uc on F may be close
to a linear one and the influence of positive and negative fluctuations
in F on ucðFÞ may be negligible after averaging even if the ampli-
tude of fluctuations in uc is significant. Under such conditions, a
dependence of ucðFÞ on F02
may be weakly pronounced, see the
horizontal branch of the dashed curve, while the bulk burning rate is
expected to be increased by F02
due to an increase in the flame sur-
face area. However, contribution from the latter mechanism to the
total production of a flame surface area may be weak in sufficiently
intense turbulence, which may control the area to the leading order.
PIn summary, based on the aforementioned simple reasoning, one
may expect (i) an increase in the weakly turbulent burning rate of a
lean or rich mixture due to an increase in the flamelet surface area
caused by moderate mixture inhomogeneities, but (ii) a weak effect
of such inhomogeneities on the burning rate in highly turbulent lean
or rich flames. Moreover, a decrease in the burning rate by strong
fluctuations in F seems to be possible due to a decrease in ucðFÞ if
the probability of finding locally inflammable reactants is significant.
A similar reduction effect may be observed due to fluctuations in the
equivalence ratio around FSL;max. Indeed, different effects of mixture
inhomogeneities on the mean burning rate were reported in the lit-
erature, as discussed in the rest of the present subsection. It is worth
remembering, however, that the above discussion is simplified and
the influence of mixture stratification on ucðFÞ and mean burning
rate may depend not only on F02
and F; but also on other mixture
and flow characteristics, e.g. the mixture-fraction gradient.

PIt is also worth noting that the focus of the above discussion of
the influence of mixture stratification on turbulent burning rate was
placed on processes within the entire flame brush. At the same time,
there are reasons for hypothesizing that premixed turbulent burning
rate is controlled by the propagation of the leading points of the
flame into unburned gas [21,24,234]. If such a leading point concept
is applied to stratified turbulent combustion, then, the inner struc-
ture of a stratified flame should adjust itself to the propagation of its
leading points. Consequently, influence of mixture stratification on
ucðFÞ and flame surface area appears to be of more importance for
predicting the mean flame brush thickness and structure, whereas

PBy investigating expansion of weakly turbulent flame kernels in
lean inhomogeneous propane(cid:1)air mixtures, Renou et al. [167] have
reported an increase in the rms value of the local curvature of flame
front due to stratification. They attributed this finding to additional
wrinkling of flame surface due to the local fluctuations in mixture
fraction. Broadening of curvature PDFs was also documented in
weakly turbulent stratified flames stabilized using Cambridge slot
burner [177], but mixture stratification weakly affected curvature
PDFs obtained from highly turbulent flames stabilized using
Cambridge swirl burner [179(cid:1)181]. These results support a hypoth-
esis that the generation of flame surface area due to mixture stratifi-
cation is of statistical importance at weak turbulence only.

PBonaldo and Kelman [170] reported a moderate increase in tur-
bulent burning velocity due to stratification of the composition of
lean methane(cid:1)air flames stabilized by a weak swirl. They attributed
the effect to the stratification-induced wrinkling of the instanta-
neous flame surface. They have also noted that “the formation of
flame front shapes with small positive radius of curvature is more
probable with stratified flames” [170].

PA moderate increase in the mean FSD S due to mixture inhomo-
geneities was also documented in V-shaped lean methane(cid:1)air
flames by Anselmo-Filho et al. [176] and by Sweeney et al. [177], e.g.
see Fig. 17. In the latter paper, an increase in the 3D scalar dissipa-
tion rate xc by stratification was also reported. Contrary to those
weakly turbulent (Ret 1⁄4 38 [176]) flames, B€ohm et al. [172] did not
find a notable effect of mixture inhomogeneities on “small scale
flame wrinkling” in lean, stratified CH4(cid:1)air jet flames stabilized in
significantly more intense turbulence. Moreover, by investigating
turbulent flames stabilized with a bluff body (Cambridge swirl
burner) and characterized by u0=SL 1⁄4 Oð10Þ; Sweeney et al. [179,180]
did not find a notable effect of stratification on scatter plots of the
local FSD |rc| or scalar dissipation rate xc vs. c. Similarly, under con-
ditions of those experiments, stratification weakly affected PDF for
the local curvature k of flame front. Furthermore, Sweeney et al.
[181] obtained very similar dependencies of the mean FSD on c from
both premixed and stratified highly turbulent flames. The notable
(negligible) effect of stratification on FSD in weak (intense) turbu-
lence is consistent with a standpoint that intense turbulence wrin-
kles flame surface much stronger than mixture inhomogeneities do.
PIt is worth noting that the SðcÞ-curves plotted in Fig. 17 show
non-monotonic dependence on stratification level. The highest peak
S is observed at a medium stratification level (curve 3). The lowest
(in the stratified cases 2(cid:1)6) peak S is observed at the highest strati-
fication level (curve 6), with the mixture composition being inflam-
mable in the leanest fuel(cid:1)air streams in this case. These results may
in part be explained by assuming that, in case 6, the increase in FSD
due to mixture stratification is bounded, because the flame cannot

Penter volumes where the local mixture composition is outside the
lean flammability limit.

PBy simultaneously recording OH and CH2O PLIF signals in order to
evaluate the local HRR, Vena et al. [190] documented local extinction
events in small near-stoichiometric regions of a stratified flame
brush at the highest degree of mixture inhomogeneity obtained in
the experiments, i.e. at j r yFj 1⁄4 29 m(cid:1)1. When applying the same
diagnostic tools to a significantly wider region of the flame brush,
where F was varied from 0.74 to 1.2, a well pronounced (up to
22.5%) reduction effect of j r yFj on the mean local HRR per flame
length was measured, but the effect was in part counteracted by an
increase (up to 17.2%) in the mean length of flame contours
extracted from the instantaneous 2D images of the HRR [190]. These
results imply that, under conditions of those experiments, both a
reduction in the mean local consumption velocity and an increase in
flame surface area due to mixture inhomogeneities play a role, but
the former mechanism overwhelms the latter.
P4.2.2. Direct numerical simulations

PBy performing 3D DNS of single-step-chemistry highly turbulent
(u0=SL 1⁄4 7:5) flames subject to fluctuations in the equivalence ratio
around F 1⁄4 1:0; H(cid:3)elie and Trouv(cid:3)e [209] reported that the fluctua-
tions reduced burning rate, with the effect being claimed to be “a
direct consequence of the nonlinear, laminar-like variations of mass
burning rate with mixture composition”. In other words, the effect
was attributed to a decrease in ucðFÞ; as sketched in Fig. 15, see solid
curve and insert (a).

PResults obtained by Haworth et al. [210] in 2D complex-chemis-
try DNSs of moderately turbulent (u0=SL 1⁄4 4:67) premixed flames
subject to harmonic spatial variations of the equivalence ratio (from
0.5 to 2.7 with F 1⁄4 1:0) in the incoming flow indicate weak influ-
ence of such mixture inhomogeneities on the flame length, which is
2D counterpart of flame surface area in 3D case.

PIn a subsequent study, Jim(cid:3)enez et al. [211] did not find a notable
effect of mixture inhomogeneities (0.03 (cid:2) F (cid:2) 2.06 and F 1⁄4 0:6)
on flame length. Nevertheless, in very intense [u=SLðFÞ 1⁄4 11:6] turbu-
lence, an increase in the total HRR was documented and was attrib-
uted to a stronger resistance of the local consumption velocity uc
to turbulent straining in locally near-stoichiometric flames, which
existed in the stratified case, but did not exist in a lean (F 1⁄4 0:6)
homogeneously premixed flame.
In particular, a ratio of uc=SL
was equal to 0.7 and 1.0 in the homogeneous and stratified cases,
respectively.

PGarrido-L(cid:3)opez and Sarkar [212] compared results of 2D DNSs of
lean laminar and turbulent flames subject to imposed mixture-
fraction fluctuations. In the laminar case, those fluctuations signifi-
cantly increased the mean length of the instantaneous flame, see
squares in Fig. 18, but the effect was significantly reduced with
increasing u0=SLðFÞ; see circles and triangles. It is worth stressing
that Garrido-L(cid:3)opez and Sarkar [212] simulated not only single-step
chemistry flames with heat release and density variations, but also
the progress of a reaction in the case of a constant density, with all
other things being equal. In the latter case, a much weaker effect of
mixture inhomogeneities on the flame length and burning rate was
found and the instantaneous flame front looked like a weakly wrin-
kled, almost planar surface. On the contrary, large-scale distortions
of the front were well pronounced in the case of variable density,
with these distortions significantly increasing the flame length, see
Fig. 19. Accordingly, Garrido-L(cid:3)opez and Sarkar [212] have concluded
that, in the laminar case, “the hydrodynamic instability11 caused by
gas expansion, catalyzed by the composition fluctuations interacting
with the flame, is found to be responsible for the flame length
enhancement.” This interesting hypothesis definitely deserves

11 As theoretically shown by Darrieus [237] and Landau [238], an infinitely thin
premixed flame front is unstable with respect to infinitesimal perturbations if the
density of products is lower than the density of reactants, e.g. see [19,20,234,239].

Pfurther study and development. It is worth remembering, however,
that, in the case of premixed turbulent combustion, the hydrody-
namic instability of laminar flame fronts is commonly considered to
play an important role only at low u0/SL [64,78,240,241]. Accordingly,
the instability is not expected to be of importance in highly turbu-
lent stratified flames and the data by Garrido-L(cid:3)opez and Sarkar [212]
seem to support such a standpoint, cf. squares and triangles in
Fig. 18.

PGrout et al. [213] performed a DNS study of a single premixed
flame (F 1⁄4 0:74) and a single stratified flame (0.4 (cid:2) F (cid:2) 1.2,
F 1⁄4 0:74) propagating in statistically the same weak (u0=SL 1⁄4 0:7
in the homogeneous case) turbulence and reported that mixture
stratification increased the flame surface area and, therefore, burn-
ing rate.

PMalkeson and Chakraborty [214] performed 3D DNS study of pre-
mixed flames subject to random fluctuations in the equivalence
ratio. In the case of F 1⁄4 1:0; they did not observe any notable effect
of the fluctuations in the bulk burning rate, cf. filled diamonds and
open circles in Fig. 20, whereas the burning rate was increased by
the fluctuations when F 1⁄4 0:7; cf. open squares and filled triangles.
At first glance, the latter result might be associated with an increase
in flame surface area due to mixture inhomogeneities, whereas this
effect is expected to be counterbalanced by a decrease in ucðFÞ in
the case of F 1⁄4 1:0. Indeed, in the latter case, mixture inhomogenei-
ties reduced the mean value of the local displacement speed,
whereas such an effect was less pronounced at F 1⁄4 0:7 [215]. More-
over, dependencies of the mean FSD j r cj on ec; reported in Fig. 2 in
[221], indicate an increase in j r cj due to the mixture inhomogenei-
ties in case F (F 1⁄4 0:7; u0=SLðFÞ 1⁄4 8).

PPera et al. [231] noted that mixture composition and temperature
inhomogeneities enhanced wrinkling of the instantaneous flame

Psurface in a weak turbulence, with the temperature inhomogeneities
playing a more important role. However, the influence of the inho-
mogeneities on the flame-kernel growth was much weaker than the
influence of turbulence even in the case of u0/SL < 1, addressed by
Pera et al. [231]. In particular, the bulk (i.e. integrated over the
computational domain) HRRs averaged over an ensemble of statisti-
cally equivalent runs were almost the same in homogeneous and
inhomogeneous cases. Nevertheless, the inhomogeneities (primarily,
the temperature inhomogeneities) notably (about 10%) increased
the rms of fluctuations in the global HRR from run to run. Such
fluctuations are of importance for understanding cycle-to-cycle
variations in SI engines.

P4.2.3. Summary

PIn laminar and weakly turbulent flows, variations in local flame
speed due to mixture stratification result in increasing the flame
surface area.

PA role played by the stratification-induced generation of flame
surface area is reduced with increasing u0/SL and generation of flame
surface is mainly controlled by turbulent stretching at high u0/SL.

PMoreover, in weakly turbulent flames, the stratification-induced
generation of flame surface area may be counterbalanced or over-
whelmed by a decrease in the mean local consumption velocity due
to fluctuations in the mixture composition.

PAccordingly, the net effect of mixture stratification on turbulent
burning rate may be either positive or negative depending on F;
F02 ; u0/SL, etc.

5. RANS And LES models of stratified turbulent flames

PCertain models of the influence of turbulence on combustion,
which were developed for RANS and LES research into stratified burn-
ing, are briefly summarized in Tables 5 and 6, respectively. In addition
to studies addressed in Table 6, it is also worth mentioning a recent
paper by Fiorina et al. [266], which reports results of application of
five different numerical platforms to LES of a single non-adiabatic
stratified turbulent flame TSF-A, which was experimentally investi-
gated using the Darmstadt burner [171,172]. Four of these five plat-
forms are based on models addressed in Table 6, see papers by Duwig
and Fureby [254], Auzillon et al. [257], Trisjono et al. [260], and Proch
and Kempf [262]. The fifth platform does not invoke a model of the
influence of turbulence on combustion, i.e. contributions of unre-
solved subgrid scales to the filtered reaction rates are neglected.

PIt is worth stressing that Tables 5 and 6 and subsequent discus-
sion do not aim at comparing validation of various models or ranking
them. On the one hand, almost all RANS and, especially, LES models
listed in Tables 5 and 6, respectively, yielded good agreement with
experimental data obtained from some stratified turbulent flames,
e.g. see very impressive Figs. 21(cid:1)24 and note that these encouraging
results12 have been computed using detailed chemical mechanisms.

12 As noted by a reviewer, “most of the comparisons were done upstream of the
region where stratification would be expected to have an effect on flame propaga-
tion”. For instance, Fig. 18 in [173] shows that mixing layer and mean flame brush
overlap substantially at distances larger than 50 mm from the nozzle of the Darm-
stadt burner in the case of flame A (F1 1⁄4 0:6 and F2 1⁄4 0:9).

POn the other hand, the number of substantially different stratified
flames simulated invoking any of these models is still small. More-
over, different models, which are based on different and sometimes
opposite (e.g. see two models tested in Ref. [256]) assumptions, are
unlikely to be valid together under the same conditions. Therefore,
the turbulent combustion community has a significant need for
further testing advanced models of stratified burning under a signifi-
cantly wider range of conditions. The present author does not con-
sider a RANS or LES model of stratified turbulent combustion to be
well validated today.

PFurthermore, Tables 5 and 6 do not aim at encompassing all RANS
and LES studies of stratified turbulent flames. Instead of this, the
tables aim at (i) showing the state-of-the-art in the field of

5.1. Regime-independent models

P5.1.1. Presumed PDF models. State of the art

PMost of the regime-independent models that have yet been
invoked in simulations of stratified turbulent flames are based on a
joint pPDF for mixture fraction Z and combustion progress variable c
or mass fraction YF of the deficient reactant (fuel in a lean mixture).

PFor instance, Darbyshire and Swaminathan [250] introduced a

correlated joint pPDF

PPðc; Z; ec; e

Z; rc00 2 =r; rZ00 2 =r; rc00 Z00 =rÞ; which was reduced to a
product of beta-function approximations of Pcðc; ec; rc00 2 =rÞ and
PZðZ; e
Z; rZ00 2 =rÞ in the case of rc00 Z00 1⁄4 0; but offered also an oppor-
tunity to study a case of rc00 Z00

61⁄4 0.
PTo use this approach, knowledge of the correlation rc00 Z00
is of
crucial importance. Grout et al. [213] reported that while correlation
between the mixture fraction and combustion progress variable did
not vanish under conditions of their DNS, the correlation was “rea-
sonable weak” so that approximation of the joint PDF P(Z, c) to be a
product of statistically independent PZ(Z) and Pc(c) did “not intro-
duce a significant error in approximation of the reaction rates.”

PMalkeson and Chakraborty [214] reported that the correlation
rc00 Z00 did not vanish under conditions of their DNS. The correlation

Pchanged its sign from positive at small c to negative at large c within
the globally stoichiometric flame brush, but was “mostly negative”
in the globally lean case.

PThe correlation rc00 Z00 could be evaluated by solving the transport
Eq. (52). However, Malkeson and Chakraborty [214] have found that
“none of the existing algebraic models” for the cross-scalar dissipa-
tion rate xc;Z in that transport equation is supported by their DNS
data obtained at low Damk€ohler numbers (0.05 (cid:2) Da (cid:2) 0.51). In
order to investigate behavior of various terms in transport equations
F Z00 ; the same
for cross-scalar dissipation rate xY;Z and correlation rY 00
authors [218,222] analyzed two sets of instantaneous fields obtained
in DNS of globally lean and stoichiometric stratified turbulent
flames. However, much more studies are definitely required in order
to elaborate closure relations for these terms that could predict
experimental or DNS data obtained in a wide range of substantially
different conditions.

PDovizo and Devaud [253] invoked the b-pPDF, see Eqs. (23)(cid:1)(25),
e
Pðc; ec; rc00 2 =rÞ proposed

It

PTo complete this brief review of approaches that are based on
Eq. (70), it is worth noting that, first, Ribert et al. [245], Robin et al.
[246], and Darbyshire et al. [247] invoked the RHS of Eq. (70) to model
e
PðYF ; Z; x; tÞ 1⁄4 rðYF ; ZÞPðYF ; Z; x; tÞ=rðx; tÞ
the mass-weighted PDF
instead of the conventional PDF P(YF, Z, x, t) introduced by Libby
and Williams [268].

PSecond, Robin et al. [169,246] proposed to use the following

joint 6d-pPDF
e
PðYF ; Z; x; tÞ
1⁄4 aðx; tÞffðx; tÞd1⁄2YF (cid:1)Y11ðx; tÞ(cid:8) þ 1⁄21(cid:1)fðx; tÞ(cid:8)d1⁄2YF (cid:1)Y12ðx; tÞ(cid:8)gd1⁄2Z(cid:1)Z1ðx; tÞ(cid:8)

supplemented with a transport equation for rY 00
additional closure relations, which are required, because Eq. (72)
involves nine unknown parameters; a, f, c, Y11, Y12, Y21, Y22, Z1, and
Z2.

PThird, in order to evaluate the first and second moments on the
LHS of Eq. (71) by solving the transport Eqs. (19), (26), (32), (35),
(52), (63), (64), and (65), the following turbulent fluxes ru00 Z00 ;

where Dt is turbulent diffusivity and the same value (typically 0.7
[247,250,253]) of the turbulent Schmidt number Sct is commonly
used for various fluxes. However, such closure relations are well
known to fail in predicting even the direction of a turbulent scalar
flux in various flames due to the phenomenon of countergradient
transport, as reviewed elsewhere [41,54,65,78]. Moreover, eventual
influence of mixture stratification on these fluxes can bring extra
errors, especially as fluxes ru00 c00 Z00 and ru00 Y 00
F Z00 are specific to par-
tially premixed burning. The present author is aware on a single
target-directed DNS study [220] of the behavior of the turbulent
scalar fluxes in stratified flames, with the results reported in the
cited paper revealing substantial limitations of Eq. (73). A further
research into the issue is definitely required.

should be modeled, because the last term on the RHS of Eq. (35)
or (64), respectively, is approximately equal to (cid:1)2rexc or (cid:1) 2rexY
;
respectively, at high Reynolds numbers. Algebraic closure relations
for exc or exY that allow for the influence of mixture stratification on
the mean scalar dissipation rate were invented by Mura et al. [269]
and by Darbyshire et al. [247] by extending models developed earlier

Pby Borghi et al. [270(cid:1)272] and Swaminathan et al. [273,274], respec-
tively, for simulations of premixed turbulent combustion at high Da.
The former and latter closure relations were used in RANS computa-
tions of stratified burning in Refs. [169,247] and [247], respectively.
However, by analyzing DNS data, Malkeson and Chakraborty [214]
have noted that an algebraic closure of exY or exc
“may not be suffi-
cient” for “low Damk€ohler number combustion” investigated by
them. Nevertheless, Malkeson and Chakraborty [214] have found
that their DNS data on exY agree reasonably well with the aforemen-
tioned model developed by Kolla et al. [274] for premixed combus-
tion at high Da.

PMoreover, in order to investigate behavior of various terms in
=r and scalar dissipation
transport equations for the variance rY 002
F
; Malkeson and Chakraborty [216,217] analyzed two
rates xY and xZ
sets of instantaneous fields obtained in DNS of globally lean and stoi-
chiometric stratified turbulent flames. However, much more studies
are definitely required in order to elaborate closure relations for
these terms that could predict experimental or DNS data obtained in
a wide range of substantially different conditions.

PThus, a number of issues associated with modeling stratified tur-
bulent flames by invoking a joint pPDF for Z and c or YF should be
resolved.

P5.1.2. Presumed PDF models. Pro et contra

PNevertheless, at first glance, such regime-independent pPDF
models might appear to be superior to an extended model of pre-
mixed turbulent combustion, as far as research into stratified burn-
ing is concerned. Therefore,
further development of the pPDF
approach might appear to be fully justified. However, such a stand-
point may be disputed. Although applicability of a regime-indepen-
to premixed, non-premixed, and partially
dent pPDF model
premixed turbulent flames is an obvious important advantage, it
does not seem to overwhelm basic limitations of the model referred
to.

PTo clearly show such limitations, let us consider the simplest par-
adigm of stratified turbulent combustion, i.e. propagation of a pre-
mixed turbulent flame through inhomogeneous mixture, with the
influence of the inhomogeneity on the flame being solely reduced to
spatial (or temporal) variations in the mean (ensemble averaged)
equivalence ratio. To predict the burning rate in such a hypothetical
stratified flame, a model should be able to well predict the influence
of F on the premixed turbulent burning rate. In other words, the
model should perform well in the case of premixed turbulent com-
bustion. Such a demand appears to be the major requirement to any
model of stratified burning.

PHowever, the regime-independent models that are based on a
joint pPDF for Z and c or YF do not seem to be capable to satisfy this
key requirement. In particular, because substitution of q 1⁄4 rc2 into
Eq. (48) results in

1⁄4 rbc(cid:1)rec2

rc00 2 1⁄4 rc2 (cid:1)rec2
1⁄4 recð1(cid:1)ecÞ;
ð74Þ
the segregation factor given by Eq. (40) tends asymptotically (g ! 0)
to unity within the framework of the BML approach. Therefore,
Eq. (34) involves a single independent constraint and, hence, do not
allow us to evaluate two independent parameters y and &. For
instance, Eq. (39) cannot be used if egc

! 1.

PIn a practical situation associated with a small, but non-zero 1(cid:1)

; Eq. (34) or (39) allows us to simulate
the pPDF approach is invoked to evaluate the mean rate _vc using
Eq. (41), then, the obtained value of _vc will be highly sensitive both
to a choice of the shape of the pPDF and to small errors in evaluation
of ec and rc00 2 =r. Such errors are inevitable not only due to a limited
accuracy of numerical integration of partial differential equations,
but also and mainly due to the lack of sufficiently accurate closure
relations for the flux ru00 c00 in Eq. (32) or the fluxes ru00 c00 and ru00 c00 2 ;

1(cid:1)egc (cid:7) 1 and, finally, the mean reaction rate averaged by invoking
a joint pPDF. Even if the problem of evaluating a small difference in
unity and the segregation factor egc may be circumvented by solving
a transport equation for this difference,13 such an approach does not
resolve other fundamental issues associated with using Eq. (41) and
a pPDF

e
Pcðc; ec; rc00 2 =rÞ for averaging the mean rate _vc.

PIndeed, the strong sensitivity of _vc given by Eq. (41) to the shape
e
Pcðc; ec; rc00 2 =rÞ and, hence, to the values of ec and rc00 2 =r
of pPDF
was pointed out by Bilger (see discussion on p. 38 in Ref. [112])
immediately after the first application [112] of this approach to
modeling premixed turbulent combustion in the BML limit, i.e. at g
(cid:7) 1. Due to this fundamental flaw, the approach was beyond the
mainstream research into premixed turbulent flames for about two
decades. However, the approach is in use today [113(cid:1)124], even if
nobody (to the best of the present author’s knowledge) has yet prop-
erly responded to the solid criticism by Bilger.

POn the contrary, the criticism by Bilger was supported in a couple
of papers. For instance, Huang and Lipatnikov [276] compared
dependencies of _vcðcÞ obtained by averaging _vcðcÞ invoking two dif-
e
Pcðc; ec; rc00 2 =rÞ and (ii)
ferent pPDFs, i.e. (i) the beta-function pPDF
the following three-parametric pPDF Pc(c, a, c1, c2)
PcðcÞ 1⁄4 adðc(cid:1)c1Þ þ ð1(cid:1)aÞdðc(cid:1)c2Þ;
ð75Þ
where 0 (cid:2) c1 < c2 (cid:2) 1. Even if not only the first c and second c02
moments, but also the third c03 moments were equal for the two
compared pPDFs, the obtained dependencies of _vcðcÞ were signifi-
cantly different at egc 1⁄4 c02 =1⁄2cð1(cid:1)cÞ(cid:8) as low as 0.25, cf. curves 1 and 3
in Fig. 25b. At egc 1⁄4 0:9; the peak values of _vcðcÞ differ by a factor of
about seven, cf. curves 1 and 3 in Fig. 25c.

PLipatnikov et al. [279] analyzed DNS data obtained under condi-
tions that are well associated with the validity of the BML paradigm,
as shown elsewhere [133], and compared _vcðcÞ extracted straight-
forwardly from the DNS with _vcðcÞ computed by invoking the beta-
e
Pcðc; ec; rc00 2 =rÞ or the three-parametric pPDF Pc(c, a,
function pPDF
c1, c2), with the first three moments being extracted from the same
DNS. Moreover, Lipatnikov et al. [279] computed _vcðcÞ by testing
various recent extensions [113,114,117] of the BML PDF, i.e. (i) by
invoking a model expression for the flamelet PDF Pc, f in Eq. (46) and
(ii) by evaluating g using the DNS data on ec and rc00 2 =r. While the
DNS dependencies of r on c were equally well predicted by all tested
Pc, including the BML PDF given by Eq. (46) with g 1⁄4 0; the studied

13 A transport equation for this difference was introduced by Bray et al. [275], but
has not yet been applied to simulating an experiment, to the best of the present
author’s knowledge.

PpPDFs significantly overpredicted _vcðcÞ. While the extended BML
PDFs [113,114,117], which all reduced to the same pPDF under con-
ditions of those DNSs, performed slightly better than the beta-func-
tion pPDF, the former pPDF failed in predicting _vcðcÞ even in the
case of a low g, i.e. in the case that the PDF was designed for. In par-
ticular, the peak values of _vcðcÞ were overpredicted by a factor of
about two in flames characterized by s 1⁄4 7:53 and 5.0 and by a fac-
tor of about 1.4 in a flame characterized by s 1⁄4 2:5. Moreover, Lipat-
nikov et al. [279] showed that small (15%) variations in the DNS data
on ec or rc00 2 =r resulted in significant (100%) variations in _vc yielded
by the pPDFs.

PIn addition to the sensitivity problem pointed out by Bilger and
discussed above, application of the pPDF approach to evaluating _vc
in the case of a low g does not seem to be self-consistent. Indeed, in
e
Pcðc; ec; rc00 2 =rÞ; Eq. (35) should be solved, but
order to model a pPDF
the scalar dissipation rate exc should be closed for the latter purpose.
However, if g (cid:7) 1, then, the following linear relation

derived theoretically by Bray [111] holds, with cm varying weakly in
the largest part of the mean flame brush [133]. Therefore, if a closure
of exc is invoked to solve Eq. (35), then, the mean rate _vc may be eval-
uated using Eq. (76), whereas Eq. (41) appears to be redundant. If,
_vc is determined using Eq. (41), then, the consistency
nevertheless,
of the obtained rate with Eq. (76) and the invoked model of exc
should be checked. However, the present author is not aware on a
study that reports results of such a test of self-consistency of a
model that invokes Eqs. (35) and (41) in order to average _vcðcÞ.
Alternatively, one could use Eqs. (41) and (76) in order to close exc in
Eq. (35), but the present author is not aware on such a study either.

PAll in all, at least in the case of a low probability g, the pPDF
approach to averaging _vcðcÞ appears to be basically flawed due to
the sensitivity and self-consistency problems discussed above. The
point is that, within the framework of the considered approach, the

Pcombustion stems from the following two basic differences between
the two modes of burning. First, a Z-field varies relatively smoothly
in a non-premixed flame when compared to highly localized jumps
in c from 0 to 1 in a premixed flame. Second, because Eq. (18) does
not involve a counterpart of the highly non-linear source term _vcðcÞ
in Eq. (30), the problem of averaging such a source term is circum-
vented by the Z-pPDF approach to modeling non-premixed combus-
tion. On the contrary, such a problem is of paramount importance
for modeling premixed turbulent flames, but it has not yet been
responded properly by the c-pPDF approach.

PSome DNS data [122] indicate that the b-pPDF approach to aver-
aging _vcðcÞ works well at low Damk€ohler and high Karlovitz num-
bers, when the probability g and the difference in unity and gc
_vc to the shape of a
are not small. Nevertheless, sensitivity of
e
Pcðc; ec; rc00 2 =rÞ is significant even at egc as low as 0.25, see
pPDF
Fig. 25b. Moreover, as discussed above, Eq. (41) does not allow us to
predict _vc at g (cid:7) 1, because the probability g r < g is low if the latter
probability g (cid:7) 1. This basic problem may not vanish even if g is
comparable with the probabilities a and/or b, because the probabil-
ity g r required to evaluate _vc may still be small even in such a case.
Indeed, recent experimental and DNS data reviewed elsewhere
[24,74] show that heat release is localized to thin zones, thus imply-
ing a sufficiently low g r, even in intense turbulence characterized by
a high Ka.

PIn summary, the use of a pPDF Pðc; ec; rc00 2 =rÞ for averaging the
mass rate _vcðcÞ of product creation in an inhomogeneously pre-
mixed turbulent flame appears to be a fundamentally flawed
approach, because (i) the mean rate _vc is controlled by a low proba-
bility g r of finding thin reaction zones, whereas (ii) the values of ec
and rc00 2 =r; which are invoked to model the pPDF, depend weakly
on g r, but are mainly controlled by the probabilities a and b of find-
ing fresh reactants and products, respectively. Consequently, even
small variations in computed values of ec and rc00 2 =r; caused e.g. by a
limited precision of relations invoked to close some terms in the
considered set of transport equations, can strongly change g r and
_vc averaged using the pPDF.

P5.1.3. Other approaches

PThe above critical comments on the pPDF approach do not mean
that regime-independent models should not be developed or used.
There are promising approaches that could result in elaborating a
predictive regime-independent model
in foreseeable future. For
instance, models that deal with a transport equation for PDF P(Z, x, t)
were successfully applied to simulations of non-premixed turbulent
flames, as reviewed elsewhere [42(cid:1)44,75]. Recently, transport equa-
tions for PDFs P(c, x, t) and P(Yk, x, t) were successfully applied to
simulations of highly turbulent premixed counterflow flames [109]
and, respectively, four flames (2 PF + 2 SF) [110] investigated experi-
mentally using Cambridge swirl burner [179,180]. Therefore, the
PDF transport equation approach appears to have a significant
potential to yield a predictive regime-independent model of turbu-
lent combustion. However, much more tests (and eventual develop-
ment) of this approach against experimental data obtained from
various premixed turbulent flames under substantially different
conditions are definitely required to fulfill its potential.

PMoreover, it is worth remembering that even a multi-species PDF
P(Yk, x, t) does not describe non-local phenomena such as back-sup-
ported combustion. In order to allow for such phenomena, the list of
sample variables that the PDF depends on should involve rZ at least.
PThere are other promising approaches to elaborating a predictive
regime-independent model of turbulent combustion, e.g. the Linear
Eddy Model (LEM) by Kerstein [62], a sparse-Lagrangian Multiple
Mapping Conditioning (MMC) model developed by Klimenko et al.
[280(cid:1)283], or recently introduced transport equations for instanta-
neous and mean (or filtered) reaction rates in a turbulent flow

P[284,285]. However, these approaches also require further tests and
eventual development.

5.2. Extended models of premixed flames

PLet us now consider models of stratified burning that extend pre-
decessor models of premixed turbulent flames. Extension of a latter
model is typically performed in two major directions. First, the
transport Eq. (19) for the Favre-averaged mixture fraction is solved
in order to allow for stratification-induced variations of mixture
characteristics (SL, dL, etc.) that the model involves as input parame-
e
ZÞ;
ters. If, subsequently, constant SL, dL, etc. are substituted with SLð
e
ZÞ; etc., such a simple extension of the model offers an opportu-
dLð
nity to simulate effects caused by variations in the mean equivalence
ratio, as further discussed in Section 5.2.1. All premixed flame mod-
els addressed in Tables 5 and 6 are extended in this way. Second, to
allow for effects caused by fluctuations in mixture fraction, the vast
majority of extended models of premixed turbulent combustion
invoke a pPDF for mixture fraction, as further discussed in Sec-
tion 5.2.2. Moreover, a few extended models address other effects,
as discussed in Section 5.2.3.

P5.2.1. Variations in the mean equivalence ratio

PAs stated above, the major requirement to a model of stratified
turbulent combustion consists in ability of the model to well predict
the influence of the local mean (ensemble averaged) equivalence
ratio on the burning rate. Advanced models of premixed turbulent
flames allow for dependence of St or _vc on SL(F) and dL(F) and,
fulfilling this requirement.
therefore, aim straightforwardly at
Accordingly, when compared to the regime-independent models
addressed in the previous subsection, the major advantage of the
extended models of premixed combustion is expected to consist of
capabilities of such models to well predict influence of spatial or
temporal variations in F on the local St or _vc .

PSuch expectations appear to be justified for models developed for
RANS simulations. For instance, as reviewed elsewhere [24,63], pre-
dictive capabilities of (i) the so-called Turbulent Flame Closure (TFC)
model [286(cid:1)288] of the influence of turbulence on premixed com-
bustion and (ii) its extension known as Flame Speed Closure (FSC)
model [289,290] were well documented in simulations of various
premixed turbulent flames under a wide range of substantially dif-
ferent conditions (various fuels, various equivalence ratios, various
pressures, various flame configurations, etc.), see also the latest rele-
vant papers [291,292]. Moreover, these models were successfully
applied to compute stratified burning rate in DI SI engines [243,252]
or an industrial combustor [244], see Table 5.

PAs far as models of premixed turbulent combustion that are
extended for LES of stratified burning are concerned, the aforemen-
tioned advantage is still mainly hypothetical, because any LES model
of premixed turbulent flames has yet been validated within a signifi-
cantly narrower range of substantially different conditions than the
aforementioned RANS models.14 On the one hand, the cause of so
big difference in the numbers of substantially different experiments
that the RANS and LES models have been applied to is clear. First,
RANS simulations of turbulent combustion were performed by vari-
ous research groups over decades, whereas LES is a significantly
younger and much more expensive research tool. Second, a LES of a
flame requires significantly longer time than RANS computation of
the same flame. For instance, within the RANS framework, an
expanding statistically spherical turbulent premixed flame can be
modeled by numerically solving 1D transport equations using a
coarse mesh, whereas 3D transport equations should be integrated
using a fine mesh in order to simulate the same flame within the LES

14 On the contrary, for several single flames or sets of similar flames, e.g. see

Figs. 21(cid:1)24, validation of LES models is far superior than validation of RANS models.

Pframework. Accordingly, the significantly smaller number of sub-
stantially different (various fuels, F, p, T, flame configurations, etc.)
tests of a LES model of premixed turbulent combustion when com-
pared to the aforementioned RANS models does not devaluate the
former approach (especially, bearing in mind very impressive valida-
tion results obtained in some cases, e.g. see Figs. 21(cid:1)24) and the dif-
ference in the numbers of validation studies is likely to be
substantially reduced in foreseeable future.

POn the other hand, the fact that a widely used experimental con-
figuration such as an expanding statistically spherical turbulent pre-
mixed flame is beyond the focus of LES research into turbulent
combustion, with a few exceptions [293,294], should not be
neglected, especially as (i) a great number of data were obtained in
experiments with such flames, including effects of fuel formula,
equivalence ratio, pressure, temperature, etc. on burning rate, and
(ii) such a laboratory experiment is the simplest well-defined case
for investigating flame propagation in a SI engine.
It is worth
remembering that combustion in a DI SI engine is one of the two
major areas of utilization of the stratified burning mode.

PMoreover, foundations of certain models of the effects of subgrid
turbulence on the filtered burning rate in LES appear to require fur-
ther study. For instance, within the framework of thickened flame
approach [295], which is widely used in LES of turbulent combustion
[3,17], see also simulations by Kuenne et al. [173], Ketelheun et al.
[258], and Proch and Kempf [262] in Table 6, the aforementioned
effect is taken into account by invoking an efficiency function
[295(cid:1)297], which parameterizes results of 2D DNSs of the influence
of a pair of counter-rotating vortices on a laminar premixed flame.
However, (i) such a simple 2D model is unlikely to properly repre-
sent all admissible scenarios of local interaction of turbulent eddies
with reaction zones within a mean flame brush and (ii) the afore-
mentioned simulations were performed for limited ranges of Uu/SL
and Rv/dL. Here, the velocity Uu and length Rv scales characterize the
vortices. Furthermore, at least three substantially different efficiency
functions were proposed to be used [295(cid:1)297], with none of them
being supported by results of a recent experimental study of the
influence of a toroidal vortex on a laminar premixed flame [298], cf.
symbols with lines in Fig. 26. Therefore, if effects of subgrid turbu-
lence on the filtered burning rate are of statistical importance when
invoking the thickened flame approach to LES of a premixed or strat-
ified turbulent flames, then, the use of an efficiency function for
modeling such effects requires further investigation.

P5.2.2. Mixture fraction fluctuations

PWhile a number of substantially different approaches to simulat-
ing the influence of spatial and temporal variations in F on the local
mean burning rate in a stratified flame were proposed to be used,
as illustrated in Tables 5 and 6, the influence of fluctuations in the
equivalence ratio F or mixture fraction Z on the burning rate is

Pcommonly addressed using a single approach, which consists in
Z; rZ00 2 =rÞ given by Eqs. (23)(cid:1)(25) or its
invoking the b-pPDF
d
rZ00 2 =brÞ. Even if this
LES counterpart,
approach is widely accepted, certain relevant issues require further
studies.

often assumed to vanish. However, such a simplification is definitely

wrong at least for the latter correlation [214], because rY 00
(cid:1)YF;1ÞrZ00 2 as c ! 0; see Eq. (56). Accordingly, if the state of a reacting
mixture is characterized with YF in order to bypass the problem of
closing the last two terms on the RHS of Eq. (58), then, another prob-
lem should be resolved, i.e. a model capable for predicting the corre-

ing rate when applying the G-equation [22], TFC [287], FSC [289],
Weller [299], or Muppala et al. [300] model, to simulations of a strat-

PTypical results shown in Fig. 27 indicate that the difference
in the canonical and mass-weighted PDFs may be neglected
when averaging S1=2
the performed
tests, thus, significantly simplifying modeling the influence of
fluctuations in the mixture fraction on the mean burning rate.
However, that single test cannot justify such a simplification in
a general case. Therefore, the discussed issue should be borne
in mind when invoking Eq. (77) or (78) in order to model
stratified turbulent combustion under conditions that differ sub-
stantially from the conditions of the study by Lipatnikov and
Huang [301].

PWhen averaging _vcðcÞ in a premixed turbulent flame, a similar
Taylor expansion (TE) method is well known to perform poorly
[23,24] for the following two major reasons. First, the magnitude of
fluctuations in c is large in many premixed turbulent flames, i.e. the
segregation factor egc is sufficiently close to unity, as reviewed else-
where [65]. Second, a dependence of the rate _vc on the combustion
progress variable c is strongly non-linear. However, similar reasons
do not hold when averaging hr|Z i(Z) or St(Z) in many stratified
turbulent flames, because (i) the segregation factor egZ defined by
Eq. (25) is often low in such flames and (ii) typical dependencies
of the conditioned density hr|Z i, turbulent flame speed St, the
conditioned reaction rate h _vcjZ i; etc. on the mixture fraction Z
are substantially less non-linear than a typical dependence of _vcðcÞ.
PFor instance, in multidimensional numerical simulations of com-
bustion in a DI SI engine, (i) the dependence of turbulent flame
speed on Z is mainly controlled by SL(Z), as reviewed elsewhere
[63], but (ii) the dependence of SL on the equivalence ratio F is
commonly approximated with a second order polynomial following
the work by Metghalchi and Keck [136], and (iii) the mixture frac-
tion depends almost linearly on F. In such a case, the dependence

P5.2.3. Other issues

PAs discussed in Sections 2.5, 4.1, and 4.2, three basic peculiarities
of stratified burning consist of (i) straightforward influence of cross-
dissipation xc, Z and mixture fraction dissipation rate xZ on the
transport of the Favre-averaged combustion progress variable, see
the last two terms on the RHS of Eq. (58) or the last term on the RHS
of Eq. (59), (ii) back-supported combustion and extension of flam-
mability limits, and (iii) an increase in flame surface area due to mix-
ture inhomogeneities.

PIn certain studies [164,250,253], the last term on the RHS of
Eq. (59) was simply neglected. Nevertheless, this term was addressed
in a few papers. In particular, Duwig and Fureby [254] and Cavallo
Marincola et al. [261] invoked the following closure relation

for the filtered cross dissipation term within LES framework. Here,
DD appears to be a subgrid turbulent diffusivity. The present author
is not aware on target-directed assessment of this closure relation.

PIt is also worth noting that the cross dissipation term may be sig-
nificantly smaller than the largest terms on the RHS of Eq. (58) or
(59). For instance, Malkeson and Chakraborty [215] found that (i)
the contribution Sd, Z of mixture inhomogeneity to the local displace-
ment speed Sd, see Eq. (62), was negligible and (ii) mixture stratifica-
tion weakly affected dependence of Sd on the local curvature and

Pstrain rate under conditions of their DNS. Hesse et al. [224] did not
find a notable contribution of Sd, Z to Sd either. Nevertheless, a few
cases studied in the cited papers cannot warrant that the cross dissi-
pation term may be neglected in a general case.

PAs far as back-supported combustion and the increase in flame
surface area due to mixture inhomogeneities are concerned, these
phenomena are commonly ignored by closure relations invoked for
mean quantities in RANS computations or for filtered quantities in
LESs of stratified turbulent flames.

PIt is worth noting, however, that back-supported combustion
might somehow be addressed by models that retain the cross dissi-
=Z on the RHS of Eq. (59). Indeed, the three last
pation term rxc;Z
terms on that RHS may be modeled as follows [254]

Accordingly, if rcrZ > 0, then, the mean burning rate is increased
due to mixture stratification. Because the back support of locally
lean burning causes a similar effect, the cross dissipation term might
be hypothesized to simulate the back support. However, even in this
case, there is no solid reason to assume that terms ru00 c00 and _vc are
not affected by the back support. Moreover, if the mixture is locally
rich, then, the aforementioned increase in the local burning rate due
to rcrZ > 0 is hardly associated with the back support, at least in
the simplest case of single-step combustion chemistry, which (case)
is consistent with Eq. (93).

PEq. (93) also shows that a role played by the cross dissipation
term can be estimated using a ratio of the following length
scales rD=ðruSLÞ 1⁄4 OðdLÞ and dZ 1⁄4 Z=j r Zj [254]. If the mixture frac-
tion gradient is small and the length scale dZ (cid:5) dL, then, the cross
dissipation term may be neglected. Such conditions are associated
with the DNS by Malkeson and Chakraborty [215] and Hesse et al.
[224], cited above. However, the same simplification can result in
significant errors if the length scales dZ and dL are comparable with
one another.

6. Conclusions

PThe following two well-documented small-scale effects are spe-

cific to stratified flames.

PFirst, molecular fluxes of heat and active species (H2, OH, H, etc.)
through the product side of a reaction zone play an important role in
stratified laminar burning and, in particular, can cause (i) a higher
local burning rate than in the counterpart premixed flame (back-
supported combustion) or (ii) extension of the lean flammability
limit. Due to the importance of such fluxes, the knowledge of the
local values of the combustion progress variable c and equivalence
ratio F (or mixture fraction Z) is not sufficient to predict the local
burning rate, temperature, and concentrations in the reaction zone
of a laminar stratified flame. Moreover, even the knowledge of the
local gradient rF in addition to the local c and F may be insufficient
to predict the local burning rate in a general case.

PAs far as stratified turbulent combustion is concerned, statistical
importance of local effects caused by the aforementioned fluxes defi-
nitely requires further study, even if such effects were noted in a few
papers.

PSecond, area of a flame surface may be increased due to stratifica-
tion-induced differences in the speeds of self-propagation of differ-
ent elements of the surface. Such phenomena play a role in laminar
and weakly turbulent stratified flames, but, if a ratio of u0/SL is suffi-
ciently high, the discussed increase in the flame surface area appears
to be of less importance than an increase in the flame surface area
due to turbulent stretching.

PEven in weakly turbulent flames, the considered generation of
flame surface area due to mixture stratification may be counterbal-
anced or overwhelmed by a decrease in the mean local consumption
velocity due to fluctuations in the mixture composition. Accordingly,
the net effect of mixture stratification on the mean bulk burning rate
may be either positive or negative depending on the mean value of
equivalence ratio, the magnitude of fluctuations in F, the local ratio
of u0/SL, etc.

PAs far as development of models for RANS and LES research
into stratified turbulent burning is concerned, the mainstream
approach consists in (i) adapting an advanced model of premixed
turbulent combustion and (ii) averaging the model expressions
by invoking a presumed mass-weighted PDF (or FDF) for the
mixture fraction Z in RANS (or LES, respectively). The b function
d
rZ00 2 =brÞ
approximation of this PDF
is most widely used, but this choice still requires justification.
Therefore, from the fundamental perspective, alternative PDFs or
FDFs are worth studying, as well as basically different approaches,
e.g. the Taylor expansion method.

POther issues relevant to such an adaptation of premixed com-
bustion models to simulations of stratified burning include, but
are not restricted to; (i) eventual correlation rc00 Z00 between fluc-
tuations in the combustion progress variable and mixture fraction
F Z00 between fluctuations in the mass fraction of
or correlation rY 00
the deficient reactant (fuel in a lean mixture) and mixture fraction,
(ii) cross dissipation term exc;Z or exc;Y in the transport equation for
=Z in
rc00 Z00 or rY 00
the transport equation for the mean combustion progress variable,
and (iv) eventual influence of stratification of mixture composition
on closure relations developed for premixed flames. While solely
RANS quantities were written above for simplicity, basically the
same issues are relevant to LES of stratified turbulent flames.

F Z00 ; respectively, (iii) cross dissipation term rxc;Z

PThe use of a presumed joint PDF for c or YF and Z in order to aver-
age the rate _vc or _vY ; respectively, in a stratified turbulent flame
does not seem to be a predictive approach, because modeling of the
shape of the PDF based on the first two moments of the c or YF field
does not allow researchers to appropriately evaluate the low proba-
bility of finding thin reaction zones, whereas this probability con-
trols the mean rate _vc or _vY .

PThe present author is not aware on a RANS or LES model of inho-
mogeneously premixed turbulent combustion that allows straight-
forwardly for numerically unresolved small-scale phenomena such
as generation of flame surface area due to the local stratification of
mixture composition, back-supported burning, extension of flamma-
bility limits, or another local phenomenon that stems from the
stratification-driven molecular fluxes through the product side of a
reaction zone.

PWhile certain fundamental issues associated with modeling of
effects of mixture inhomogeneities on turbulent burning have not
yet been resolved, as noted above, impressive agreement between
complex-chemistry LES results and experimental data obtained
from a few stratified turbulent flames was already demonstrated by
several research groups. Nevertheless, further tests of advanced
models of stratified turbulent combustion against experimental data
obtained in a wide range of substantially different conditions are
definitely required.
