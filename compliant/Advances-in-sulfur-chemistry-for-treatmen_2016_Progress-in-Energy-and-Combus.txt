Increased energy demand worldwide has caused faster depletion of sweet feedstock and increased ex-
ploitation of sourer hydrocarbon fuels. These fuels often contain acid gases (H2S and CO2), mercaptans
and trace amounts of benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX) that are harmful to human health, the envi-
ronment and industrial equipment. The US EPA has proposed a reduction of sulfur in gasoline from 30 ppm
to 10 ppm by 2017. To reach this goal, crude oil and gas must be subjected to more efficient desulfu-
rization processes in which acid gases are major byproducts. The separated acid gases and associated
impurities are further processed for material and energy recovery, as the fuels with high sulfur content
are restricted due to their harmful effects. In this paper, a comprehensive review of the treatment of acid
gases and associated impurities is given along with an advanced Claus process design that can capture
much greater amounts of sulfur in the thermal stage to decrease the burden in catalytic stages and reduce
operational costs. Claus process technology, although mature and commonly used for the recovery of
sulfur and energy from acid gases, has low thermal stage efficiency that further deteriorates with change
in acid gas composition. The non-uniformity of acid gas feed streams poses several technical and oper-
ational problems, resulting in higher operational costs and increased toxic gas emissions. Sulfur chemistry
provides a path for improved understanding of the complex process in the thermal stage of the Claus
reactor with a goal to recover both energy and improve the quality of sulfur produced, so that catalytic
stages are minimal. The sulfur chemistry and kinetic models of H2S combustion are reviewed. Practical
problems emanating from the presence of acid gas impurities (such as CO2, ammonia, light hydrocar-
bons, aromatics, COS and CS2) during the acid gas conversion process are evaluated. Reactor conditions
that mitigate the impact of impurities are also included. An urgent need exists for the development of
comprehensive kinetic models that can capture the combustion chemistry of H2S along with the pres-
ence of trace quantities of aromatics, ammonia and other impurities during sulfur recovery in Claus reactors.
Our current knowledge lacks a detailed chemistry, so that effective capture of acid gas conversion in the
Claus thermal stage remains a challenge. Future studies must focus on a systematic coupling of the avail-
able kinetic models for neat H2S, hydrocarbon and ammonia fuels, and subsequent validation under partially
oxidizing operating conditions in Claus reactors. Such a mechanism could help to improve the efficien-
cy of sulfur recovery processes and sulfur quality for improved design of advanced Claus reactors with
enhanced sulfur capture, energy recovery and mitigated environmental issues.

1. Introduction

Sulfur, mainly an undesirable gas, is often present in the form
of H2S in industrial and crude natural gas and is a problem in energy,
processing, and chemical industries [1]. Acid gases (H2S and CO2)
also contain other impurities that include a lower series of hydro-
carbons (C1—C4), benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX), N2, NH3, CS2
and COS [2,3]. The pernicious H2S fumes that characterize many gas
processing and operation sites for refinery and petroleum produc-
tion represent many technological challenges to safeguarding human
health and our environment.

From the environmental perspective, acid gas, particularly H2S
and BTX, has serious negative effects. This is because combustion
of H2S and BTX produces highly toxic byproducts, such as sulfur
dioxide, sulfuric acid, sulfurous acid, carbon monoxide, carbonyl
sulfide, carbon disulfide, particulate matters (PM), polycyclic aro-
matic hydrocarbons (PAH) and carbon. These byproducts affect air
quality and are also considered major sources of acidic precipita-
tion, see Kohl and Nielson [4]. Some of the formed sulfurous–
carbonaceous compounds, such as COS and CS2, reach the
stratosphere where they generate a sulfate aerosol layer to nega-
tively affect the ozone layer concentration [5].

Sulfur compounds in the chemical industry and hydrocarbon
fueled vehicles also cause corrosion to parts of refineries and com-
bustion engines because of the formation of oxy-acids of sulfur from
combustion products. Sulfur compounds are also undesirable in re-
fining processes, since they deactivate catalysts used downstream
of the process to upgrade fuel quality.

Acid gases cause numerous hazards to human health that depend
on the concentration and level of exposure, as summarized in Table 1.
Low concentrations of H2S can cause burning, itching and eye tears,
headache, dizziness, dyspnea, and skin and throat irritations [4]. High
exposure to H2S can cause asphyxiation, loss of consciousness and
even fatality, Amosa et al. [6]. The particulate matter present in diesel
exhaust can cause lung cancer in humans, aggravation of respira-
tory and cardiovascular diseases, asthma and chronic bronchitis [4,7].
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA) [8], exposure to 10 ppm or less of H2S is classified as low-
hazard, while exposures to greater than 10 ppm and less than 30 ppm
are considered medium-hazard; H2S exposures higher than 30 ppm
are designated as high-risk.

Hydrocarbon contaminants, such as BTX, are not acutely toxic
by inhalation, ingestion or exposure through the skin. Benzene is

regarded as the most hazardous compound of the BTX group and
is also classified as a known human carcinogen. The US EPA has clas-
sified benzene as a Group A and Class 1 human carcinogen. However,
toluene and xylene do not fall in this group. Short term human ex-
posures to relatively high concentrations of benzene can give rise
to various adverse health effects such as headaches, dizziness, in-
ability to concentrate, impaired short term memory and tremors.
Long term exposures can give rise to more complex health effects
that include hematotoxicity, genotoxicity, immunological and re-
productive effects as well as various cancers. A new limit value for
occupational exposure of benzene in Europe established in 2004 was
3.25 mg/m3 [9].

1.1. Regulation on sulfur content in fuels

In an effort to produce cleaner air with sulfur-bearing fuels, limits
are placed on sulfur content in fuels. Additionally, more stringent
regulations on emission of pollutants from the combustion of H2S
and BTX are promulgated by various environmental regulatory agen-
cies worldwide. The US EPA reduced the maximum allowable sulfur
content in non-road diesel fuel from an average of 3400 ppm to
500 ppm (by volume) in 2007 and further reduced the limit to
15 ppm in 2010. Highway diesel fuel was also reduced from 500 ppm
to 15 ppm (per gallon average) in June 2012 [10]. More recently, the
US EPA announced a new regulation that mandates oil and gas re-
finers to reduce the sulfur content in gasoline from the current limit
of 30 ppm to 10 ppm by 2017 [7]. A decade ago, gasoline pro-
duced in the United States contained 300 ppm of sulfur, but earlier
regulations required refiners to cut the sulfur content by 90%, down
to the current 30 ppm level. The mobile source air toxics rules were
also established by the US EPA in 2007 to reduce benzene and other
aromatics present in gasoline to further reduce hazardous air pol-
lutants emitted by motor vehicles [7,11]. The major air toxics of
concern are BTX and other hydrocarbons such as 1,3-butadiene, form-
aldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein and naphthalene. Oil and gas
refineries are facing major challenges to meet the new fuel sulfur
specifications along with the required reduction of aromatics content
[12]. These requirements are expected to become more stringent
in the future, thus putting pressure on oil and gas companies to
develop deep desulfurization processes and more environmen-
tally friendly technologies. Some of the developed sulfur removal
technologies include hydro-desulfurization (HDS), oxidative des-
ulfurization (ODS), bio catalytic desulfurization (BDS), amine
extraction and flue gas desulfurization.

1.2. Sulfur removal technologies from crude oil and gas

Some of the technologies currently used to achieve significant

sulfur removal from crude oil and gas are given below.

1.2.1. Hydro-desulfurization

Hydro-desulfurization (HDS) is a commercially proven technol-
ogy that uses a catalytic chemical process to remove sulfur from
natural gas and refined petroleum products that include gasoline
(or petrol), jet fuel, kerosene and diesel fuel. It also favors removal
of nitrogen compounds and some metal impurities [10]. The HDS
process involves catalytic treatment with hydrogen to convert the
various sulfur compounds to H2S and sulfur-free organic com-
pounds. The HDS reactor is operated at elevated temperatures
ranging from 573 to 673 K and elevated pressures ranging from 30
to 130 atm [10,13].

The catalysts consist of an alumina base impregnated with cobalt
and molybdenum. In this process, sulfur is converted to H2S, which
is then removed from the flue gas by amine scrubbing. The H2S re-
sulting from the HDS reaction is eventually subjected to further
treatment in a modified Claus process plant to recover elemental

sulfur and energy. HDS is the primary desulfurization technology
used today, although caustic washing to remove low molecular
weight thiols is also in use [13]. It is desirable for refineries to des-
ulfurize both distillate streams generated during direct distillation
of crude oil and streams coming out from the conversion units, such
as fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and hydrocracker units. Although
HDS can be performed either before FCC or after, depending on the
refinery design, it must be performed before the catalytic reform-
ing process to prevent the poisoning of the platinum-based catalysts
used in the sulfur recovery process [13,14].

HDS is an expensive technology that is energy intensive and re-
quires huge amounts of high purity hydrogen as the reactant [13,15].
Interest in HDS was initially triggered by the availability of hydro-
gen from catalytic reformers [1]. However, it is also widely
acknowledged that HDS helps to improve the fuel properties, as it
favors a higher distillate to residual fuel oil ratio, in addition to the
sulfur removal from crude oils [7,10,13]. This makes HDS more at-
tractive in light of increasing requirements for deep sulfur removal.

1.2.2. Oxidative desulfurization

Oxidative desulfurization (ODS) technology is used to produce
ultra-low sulfur diesel at low costs [14,16]. BP, Texaco, and Shell have
been developing suitable ODS technologies to obtain ultra-low sulfur
fuels [10,17]. Oxidative desulfurization is typically a two-stage
process that includes oxidation, followed by liquid extraction. In ODS,
heavy sulfides are oxidized by adding one or two oxygen atoms to
the sulfur using suitable oxidants to avoid breaking of any carbon–
sulfur bonds. This results in the formation of sulfoxide and sulfone
compounds that are then extracted or adsorbed from the light oil
due to their increased relative polarity [18]. In addition, ODS also
facilitates their separation, not only by extraction, but also by dis-
tillation or adsorption [19]. Refineries commonly use solvent
extraction technology to remove sulfur and nitrogen compounds
from light oils. The solvent is recovered and regenerated through
a distillation process [20,21]. Because of the minimal difference in
polarity between sulfur and other aromatic hydrocarbons, solvent
extraction causes loss of useful hydrocarbons along with sulfur
removal [16]. The sulfoxides and sulfones produced after ODS exhibit
increased relative polarity and are preferentially extracted from light
oil using a non-miscible solvent. The extraction efficiency depends
on the solvent’s polarity [13,19]. Other criteria for the selection of
suitable solvents include boiling point, freezing point and surface
tension. The solvent is separated out from the oxidized com-
pounds by simple distillation for recycling and regeneration. Some
common water-soluble polar solvents used are dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO), dimethyl formamide (DMF) and acetonitrile. The former
two solvents have a high extractability for sulfones, but also have
a high boiling point (573 K). This is close to the boiling point of the
sulfones, which creates difficulty in separation and regeneration for
further extraction.

The oxidative desulfurization (ODS) process offers some advan-
tages over HDS technology. The capital expenditure for ODS is less
than that of HDS, as different fractions can be oxidized under low
temperature and pressure conditions, and expensive hydrogen is not
required [13,16,22].

1.2.3. Bio-catalytic desulfurization

Bio-desulfurization (BDS) technology utilizes special protein-
based biocatalysts to remove sulfur compounds from crude oil. This
technology has drawn wide attention because of its green process-
ing of fossil fuels for sulfur removal [23]. The BDS process involves
the use of a continuously fed, well stirred reactor to bring into contact
with mixtures of air, whole cells, oil and water to produce a des-
ulfurized oil stream free of water and biocatalyst cells. Commonly
used desulfurization catalysts (microorganisms) include Rhodococcus
erythropolis IGTS 8, R. erythropolis D-1, R. erythropolis I-19 and

68

A.K. Gupta et al./Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 54 (2016) 65–92

Rhodococcus sp strain WU-K2R. These microbial catalysts have been
isolated and characterized worldwide [23–25]. BDS technology is
cheaper than HDS, as the former requires less energy and hydro-
gen. The BDS reactor is operated under ambient temperature and
pressure conditions with high selectivity, which results in de-
creased energy costs, low emission and minimal formation of
undesirable side products [25].

1.2.4. Adsorptive desulfurization (ADS)

Adsorption has been deployed in the oil and gas industry to
achieve deep sulfur removal from sulfur-bearing fuels. The removal
of sulfur compounds and dibenzothiophenes (DBT) has been studied
over zeolites, aluminosilicates, activated carbon (AC), alumina and
zinc oxide catalysts [26,27]. The use of hydrogen during adsorp-
tive desulfurization has also been identified as a suitable technique
that combines the benefits of catalytic HDS with ADS [26]. This
process is called reactive adsorption desulfurization (RADS). RADS
technology is based on reactive adsorption, wherein sulfur is cap-
tured in the form of metal sulfides using metal-based adsorbents.
The formed metal sulfide is then processed in a separate regener-
ation reactor. This technology is currently used to achieve significant
desulfurization of diesel and gasoline fuels. Conoco Phillips is using
processes called S-Zorb Diesel and S-Zorb Gasoline for naphtha,
which are based on RADS [28]. The S-Zorb for diesel contacts diesel
fuel streams with a solid sorbent in a fluid bed reactor at relative-
ly low pressures and temperature in the presence of hydrogen. The
sulfur atoms of the sulfur-containing compounds adsorb onto the
sorbent and then react. Conoco Phillips’ S-Zorb gasoline technol-
ogy operates at low pressure and elevated temperatures.

Compared to HDS, the ADS process occurs at lower tempera-
tures [10,26]. Also in RADS, the amount of hydrogen consumed in
the process is low. While the adsorption process in ADS is highly
effective, the development of adsorbents that are not only easy to
regenerate but also exhibit high adsorption capacity for sulfur com-
pounds remains a major challenge, see Hernandez and Yang [29].

1.2.5. Amine extraction

Separation of acid gas from crude natural gas commonly takes
place through an amine extraction process [30–33]. In this process,
the sour gas is passed over an aqueous solution of alkanolamines,
wherein the CO2 and H2S (acid gases) are absorbed from the up
flowing sour gas to produce a sweetened natural gas stream (i.e.,
H2S free natural gas). The concentrations of H2S and CO2 are pro-
portional to their partial pressures in the sour gas [32]. The
alkanolamines used in the amine extraction process are organic
chemical components that consist of at least one hydroxyl and amino
group. Each of these two groups has its own role in the process:
the hydroxyl group reduces pressure of the vapor in the aqueous
solution in order to increase the water solubility, while the amino
group provides the required alkaline medium in this aqueous so-
lution in order to increase the absorption tendency of the acidic
gases. The most common alkanolamines, which have been widely
used commercially, are monoethanolamine (MEA), diethanolamine
(DEA), and methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) [33]. Amines, which
contain two hydrogen atoms attached to the nitrogen atom, are called
primary amines (such as MEA), while amines having only one hy-
drogen atom attached to the nitrogen atom are called secondary
amines (such as DEA), and the amines which contain no hydrogen
atoms are called tertiary amines (such as MDEA) [32].

1.2.6. Flue gas desulfurization

Flue gas desulphurization (FGD) is important in the purifica-
tion of biomass-derived syngas that contains sulfur compounds and
also represents an efficient method for the reduction of the SO2 emis-
sions [34,35]. Some commercially available technologies for the

desulfurization of flue gas include (i) wet scrubbers, (ii) spray dry
scrubbers, (iii) sorbent injection, (iv) regenerable processes.

1.2.6.1. Wet scrubbers. This is the most widely used FGD technol-
ogy for SO2 reduction worldwide. In this process a calcium–
sodium based sorbent, which is used in a slurry mixture, is injected
into a specially designed vessel to react with the SO2 in the flue gas.
Wet scrubbing systems are commercially available in many varia-
tions. The various system-based technologies include (a) lime/
limestone/sludge wet scrubbers, (b) lime/limestone/gypsum wet
scrubbers and (c) seawater wet scrubbers. Wet scrubbers can achieve
removal efficiencies as high as 99% [36–38].

1.2.6.2. Spray dry scrubbers. The spray dry scrubbing process in-
volves reaction of SO2 with a lime suspension to the respective salts
in a spray absorber. It is a widely used FGD technology, but its ap-
plication is more favorable in processing flue gas with 0.8 × 106
N m3/h flow rate. However, it is recommended to use several modules
to deal with the total flue gas flow in larger plants. Spray dry scrub-
bers require the use of an efficient particulate control device, such
as ESP or a fabric filter. The sorbent usually used is lime, and ab-
sorber construction material is usually carbon steel, making the
process less expensive in capital costs compared to wet scrubbers
[39,40]. Spray drying can be used for fuel with sulfur content of up
to 3.5%, and the available commercial technologies can achieve sulfur
dioxide removal efficiency of up to 90% [41].

1.2.6.3. Sorbent injection. Sorbent injection systems are catego-
rized into furnace sorbent injection, economizer sorbent injection,
duct sorbent injection and hybrid sorbent injection. The simplest
sorbent injection technology is the furnace sorbent injection [42].
In this process a dry sorbent is injected into the upper part of the
furnace to react with SO2 present in the flue gas. The finely grained
sorbent is distributed quickly and evenly over the entire cross section
in the upper part of the furnace in a location where the tempera-
ture is in the range of 1023–1523 K [43]. The flue gas flows through
the convective pass, where the temperature remains above con-
stant, and the sorbent reacts with SO2 and O2 to form CaSO4, which
is later captured in a fabric filter or ESP together with unused sorbent
and fly ash.

1.2.6.4. Dry scrubbers. In the dry scrubbing process, flue gases are
purified by the reaction of SO2 with a pulverized dry sorbent added
into the system [43]. The resulting by-product is removed as dry
salt by a dust precipitator downstream of the boiler. The sorbent
additives commonly used are hydrated lime, limestone and dolo-
mite (CaCO3 MgCO3). The addition of the additive can be carried out
in three different ways: by adding it to the fuel, adding it to air, and
adding it to the flame area. This process achieves SO2 removal ef-
ficiency of 50% and can be used for fuels with sulfur content up to
1% [44].

1.2.6.5. Regenerable process. In regenerable processes, the sorbent
is regenerated chemically or thermally and reused, and elemental
sulfur or sulfur dioxide or sulfuric acid can be recovered. Regener-
able processes generally have no waste disposal, produce little
wastewater and have low sorbent make-up requirements [45].
Systems currently in operation include the Wellman–Lord process
and Walther process.

The Wellman–Lord process uses a sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) so-
lution as the sorbent. In the regeneration unit the sulfur dioxide is
desorbed from the sorbent liquid. The resulting SO2-rich gas can be
processed in a Claus process plant to recover both sulfur and thermal
energy. The Wellman–Lord process can be used to process flue gases
with a maximum flow rate of 0.6 × 106 N m3/h, from the combus-
tion of fuels with sulfur content up to 3.5%, and achieves sulfur

A.K. Gupta et al./Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 54 (2016) 65–92

69

dioxide removal efficiency of 95% [34,45]. In the Walther process,
flue gas desulphurization is achieved by the reaction of the main
SO2 component with ammonia water leading to ammonium sulfite,
which is then oxidized to ammonium sulfate. The Walther process
can be used to process flue gases with a maximum flow rate of
0.23 × 106 N m3/h, from the combustion of fuels with sulfur content
up to 1.2%, and achieves sulfur dioxide removal efficiency of 90%
[34].

1.3. Treatment of H2S-laden waste streams

The increasing need for deep sulfur removal from crude oil and
gas has caused an increase in the volume of generated acid gas and
associated impurities [46]. Lighter feedstock is becoming scarce so
that increased amounts of sourer feedstock are now exploited. The
separated acid gas from sour feedstock subsequently requires ef-
ficient treatment to recover energy, sulfur and other valuable
chemicals.

Several commercial sulfur recovery process technologies are avail-
able for the treatment of acid gases [6,46]. The most widely deployed
technologies include: (a) H2S scavengers, (b) liquid redox (LO-CAT,
SulFerox, CrystaSulf), (c) biological processes (THIOPAQ O&G), and
(d) the Claus process. These technologies can achieve very high sulfur
removal levels. For example, the Claus process has a sulfur recov-
ery efficiency of 94–98% depending on the process conditions and
feed gas composition. In order to meet the stringent regulations on
sulfur emissions, tail-gas cleanup technologies are used to further
enhance the sulfur recovery efficiency to nearly 99.99%. Some of
these tail-gas technologies in commercial application include: (a)
sub-dew Claus (CBA, MCRC and Sulfreen), (b) direct-oxidation Claus
(SUPERCLAUS EUROCLAUS) (c) reduction/absorption/recycle tailgas
cleanup (SCOT and SCOT-type), and (d) oxidation/absorption/
recycle (CANSOLV TGT, ClausMaster).

These technologies use absorption, adsorption, catalytic and
thermal oxidation processes (Claus process) to convert acid gases
to elemental sulfur. The choice of sulfur recovery process depends
on several factors that include the type of acid gas to be pro-
cessed, gas volume, temperature, pressure, required selectivity, sulfur
recovery desirability, the types and concentrations of impurities
present, air pollution laws and specifications to be met, as well as
capital and operating costs [47]. However, the first screening cri-
terion in the selection of the most cost effective sulfur removal
technology is sulfur removal capacity (see Table 2). Other factors
are also considered where the application can economically be served
by more than one technology. It is recommended to deploy scav-
engers for systems with less than 0.0023 kg/s of sulfur recovery
capacity [6,48]. If greater than 0.24 kg/s sulfur recovery capacity is
desired, then selectox and recycled selectox processes or amine gas
sweetening units in conjunction with catalytic Claus-type reac-
tors and tail-gas systems are generally the process scheme of choice,
with some notable exceptions. The most notable exception is the
processing of lean acid gas (with less than 50% H2S in the CO2:H2S
mixture), which is problematic for the Claus reactor. Liquid redox
or direct oxidation processes should be considered for anything in
between, see LaRue et al. [49].

1.3.1. H2S scavengers

In this process, the H2S-laden natural gas stream contacts special
chemicals (scavengers) that react irreversibly with H2S, resulting in
a less toxic solid or sludge-like product. This approach is generally
limited to relatively small capacity removal requirements
(<0.0012 kg/s) [49,50]. Scavengers can be solids or liquids, and may
be utilized in contacting towers.

The most common liquid scavenger is an amine-aldehyde con-
densate manufactured from mono-ethanolamine and formaldehyde
[51]. The resulting “scavenger” product is a hexa-hydrotriazine, and
is commonly called “triazine” in the industry, which is offered in a
water-based solution. The reaction products are water soluble, bio-
degradable and possess low toxicity characteristics, and are therefore
relatively simple to handle.

Solid scavengers are generally iron-based materials. They consist
of hydrated ferric oxide impregnated on wood chips. This process
works very well until the medium becomes depleted and needs to
be changed. However, the iron sulfide will react exothermically with
oxygen in the air and cause the wood media to catch fire, except
when it is kept wet. Due to safety concerns, solid scavengers em-
ployed in the industry today, such as Sulfa-Treat® and SULFUR RITE®,
use an iron oxide, which reacts with H2S to form innocuous iron
pyrite as the reaction product [6,51]. Iron pyrite is not pyrophoric,
unlike iron sulfide. The design of the solid scavenger system is de-
pendent on the mass flow rate of the H2S over the media, so large
gas flow rates with low H2S concentrations will tend to have large
vessels, with long reactor bed lives. The opposite is true for high
H2S concentration gas streams. Also the gas should be water satu-
rated to achieve maximum efficiency. A key benefit of this system
is that there is virtually no operator involved.

1.3.2. Liquid redox

This is a liquid-phase oxidation process that uses slightly alka-
line solution as a redox catalyst. The solution contains a non-
toxic, iron chelate complex. Gas stream containing H2S is contacted
with aqueous LOCAT solution in a venturi scrub Dryer. The H2S ab-
sorbed in solution is immediately oxidized to elemental sulfur. The
reduced catalyst solution is regenerated by air in an oxidizer vessel.
Sulfur is removed from the circulating solution by settling in the
bottom of the oxidizer or in a separate non-aerated vessel. Sulfur
can be recovered from the sulfur slurry by melting or via centri-
fuge. The process can remove up to 99.9% of H2S from gas stream
with any H2S concentration in the gas stream [48]. The iron-based
liquid redox process has been continuously improved since it was
first introduced in the early 1980s, with significant improvements
in the areas of operation, capital cost, and operational cost [50]. Cur-
rently, the liquid redox of choice is the LO-CAT® process licensed
by Gas Technology Products. The liquid redox process employs
aqueous-based solutions containing metal ions – usually iron – which
are capable of transferring electrons in reduction–oxidation (redox)
reactions. In the LO-CAT process, a non-toxic, chelated iron cata-
lyst is employed to accelerate the reaction between H2S and oxygen
to form elemental sulfur. All reactions take place in the liquid phase,
and achieving over 99.9% removal efficiency of the H2S is routine.
When treating natural gas streams, liquid redox systems may treat

the gas stream directly or may treat the acid gas stream produced
from an amine unit. The direct treatment scheme is generally eco-
nomical for low volume systems, while the amine/liquid redox (auto
circulation LO-CAT) scheme is more economical at higher flow rates
or higher pressures [48,52]. The liquid redox process operates at
ambient temperature; consequently, sulfur is produced as a solid,
which is often collected in the form of a filter cake that contains
65% sulfur and 35% water. This sulfur product can be upgraded to
99.9% pure molten sulfur product. The combination of operating and
equipment costs generally makes the liquid redox systems eco-
nomical up to 0.21–0.26 kg/s of sulfur [49].

1.3.3. Selectox and Recycle Selectox

The Selectox process is suitable for processing lean acid gas. It
uses a catalytic burner, which oxidizes the H2S to SO2 at a temper-
ature of about 640 K [53]. Two types of Selectox process are available:
straight through Selectox and the Recycle Selectox. The straight
through process is typically used for acid gas streams containing a
maximum of 5% H2S. The Recycle Selectox is normally used for acid
gas streams containing 5–40% H2S but can be utilized effectively on
streams of 65–70% H2S [48]. Recycle Selectox is an all-catalytic
process and has no flames at any point in the process. A special cat-
alyst bed is used to replace the acid gas burner in a conventional
Claus plant. The Selectox catalyst occupies the top few inches of the
first bed, where it promotes the selective oxidation of H2S to SO2.
The remainder of the bed is filled with Claus catalyst where the Claus
reaction occurs to about 80% completion. The reactions are highly
exothermic, and the feed gas must be monitored for the concen-
tration of H2S to avoid overheating. A recycle blower is used to dilute
the inlet H2S concentration to less than 5% by recycling a portion
of the effluent gases from the Selectox condenser. This recycling of
mainly inert gases limits the outlet temperature of the catalyst bed
to a temperature of approximately 640 K [53].

1.3.4. Claus process technology

The Claus process, shown in Fig. 1, is widely used to recover sulfur
and thermal energy from acid gases [33,54–61]. Beside the Claus
process, many commercial processes based on adsorption,

absorption, and wet oxidation are used. A comparative analysis of
the different sulfur recovery processes in commercial operation has
been reported [47]. Also, a novel chemical-looping process has been
developed for converting sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the flue gas gen-
erated from industries to elemental sulfur using oxygen carriers, such
as Ca-based or Cu-based carriers [56].

The selection of gas-treating process depends on many factors
that include the volume, temperature and pressure of gas to be pro-
cessed, selectivity required, sulfur recovery levels desired, types and
concentrations of impurities present, emission regulations to be met,
and capital and operating costs. The modified Claus technology has
very high efficiency of 95–99.8%, and offers the least hazard. It is
also a more reliable and mature technology compared to other
process types [47,55,57]. The adsorption process is limited to low
volumetric flow of acid gas. Only the Claus process can treat large
amounts of feed gas with high H2S concentration while producing
minimum ecological impact with a tail-gas treatment unit. The Claus
process is commonly divided into two stages, thermal and cata-
lytic. Fig. 2 shows flow diagram of a typical Claus reactor along with
characteristic temperatures at different locations in the thermal and
catalytic stages.

1.3.4.1. Claus thermal stage. In the thermal stage, reaction between
H2S and O2 occurs in a Claus furnace under rich conditions (equiv-
alence ratio of 3) to form elemental sulfur (S2), see Selim et al. [59,60].
The equivalence ratio is defined as the actual fuel to air normal-
ized by the stoichiometric fuel to air. During this reaction, one-
third of the H2S is burned to form SO2 (reaction (1)). The reaction
then continues between formed SO2 and unreacted H2S, in the ratio
shown in reaction (2), to produce sulfur, which is captured in liquid
or solid state. The Claus furnace operates at temperatures of 1027–
1477 K, and products from this step include sulfur dioxide, water
and unreacted H2S and other byproducts.

Fig. 2. Flow diagram of a typical Claus process (Sassi and Gupta [58]).

Additionally, some of the sulfur dioxide produced here reacts with
hydrogen sulfide inside the furnace to produce sulfur, and this ac-
counts for the greater percentage of total sulfur production (reaction
(2)). The furnace product gases then flow into a waste heat boiler
to condense the sulfur and produce high temperature and high pres-
sure steam for the Claus catalytic stages. Note that reaction (1) above
is highly exothermic, while reaction (2) is endothermic.

1.3.4.2. Claus catalytic stage. The remaining H2S from the Claus
furnace is reacted with SO2 at lower temperatures (in the range of
approximately 470–620 K) over an alumina- or titanium dioxide-
based catalyst to produce more sulfur. In the catalytic stage, mostly
S8 is produced, which is an exothermic reaction, whereas in the
thermal stage S2 is the major product [58,61]. Other allotropes of
sulfur may also be present in smaller quantities. Some 60% of el-
emental sulfur on average is produced from reaction (2) in the
thermal stage [58]. Reaction (1) is exothermic, and a cooling stage
is needed following these steps to condense out the sulfur pro-
duced. The condensed phase is then separated out from the gas
stream by draining it into a container.

The most widely used Claus catalyst in sulfur recovery units is
non-promoted spherical activated alumina. Properties associated
with optimum non-promoted Claus catalyst include high surface
area, appropriate pore size distribution, and enhanced physical prop-
erties. Catalysts with areas over 300 m2/g, macro porosities over
0.15 ml/g, and macropore radii as high as allowed by pellet density
are recommended. Alumina has a surface area of 325 m2/g, a
macroporosity of 0.14 ml/g, and a macropore radius of 5226 Å [48,62].
Other catalysts also used in the Claus process include activated
bauxite (surface area of 184 m2/g), cobalt–molybdenum hydroge-
nation catalyst (surface area of 270 m2/g), and Kaiser S-201 active
alumina (surface area of 270 m2/g), HermesCatalyst [62]. Alumina
catalysts may be deactivated generally by sulfation, but also by
carbon deposition, surface adsorption, or capillary condensation of
sulfur [63–66]. This deactivation lowers acid gas conversions, with

the consequence of higher sulfur content in the tail-gas and in-
creased tail-gas cleanup costs.

The Claus catalyst is also responsible for the conversion of mer-
captans (such as COS, CS2 and thiols), which are either present in
the acid gas as impurities or formed in the thermal stage of reactor.
However, the catalytic reactor often suffers from low catalyst ac-
tivity due to the adverse effect of water on alumina catalyst,
especially at low temperatures. This hinders COS hydrolysis and de-
creases the H2S conversion [66,67]. Conversion with low water
content, such as 5% water vapor, was found to be 2–2.5 times higher
than that obtained with 35% water content, apparently due to com-
peting reactions with SO2 and H2S for adsorption sites [68].

1.3.5. Tail-gas treatment technologies

The basic Claus process has a sulfur recovery efficiency of about
94%–98% [69]. Many developments have been made to improve con-
versions in excess of 99%, due to tightened emission limits. This
modification incorporates a tail gas clean-up process (Table 3) to
achieve such a high sulfur conversion [47,48]. A conventional Claus
process with a tail gas clean-up technology is referred to as a modi-
fied Claus process and often achieves H2S conversion efficiency in
excess of 99.9%.

1.3.5.1. Sub-dew Claus. Claus reactions are limited by reaction equi-
librium in the conventional Claus process, resulting in sulfur recovery
efficiencies of 93–96% [48]. Sub-dew point Claus technologies are
used if the sulfur recovery efficiencies of 97–99.5% are desired. This
technology extends the capability of the conventional Claus process
by operating the Claus reaction at lower temperatures, 400–430 K
(below sulfur dew-point). This allows the produced sulfur to con-
dense, causing the reaction equilibrium to favor higher sulfur
conversion. The liquid sulfur is then absorbed in the Claus cata-
lyst. This process operates in a cyclic manner to regenerate the
catalyst periodically because the catalyst activity decreases when
the sulfur load on the catalyst exceeds a certain quantity. The

catalyst activity must be regenerated thermally to restore catalyst
activity to an acceptable level. Regeneration is conducted by flowing
hot process gas, usually the first reactor effluent, through the de-
activated bed, and after sulfur desorption, the catalyst is cooled to
the operating temperature [48]. The overall sulfur recovery effi-
ciency is hindered in the presence of high amounts of COS and CS2
in the tail gas, which are formed in the thermal stage of the reactor.
Some commercial technologies include CBA from Amoco, MCRC from
Delta Hudson, Sulfreen from Lurgi, Clinsulf SDP from Linde, and
Clauspol from Prosernat.

1.3.5.2. Direct catalytic oxidation. This is a gas phase reaction where
H2S is oxidized with air over an alumina catalyst to form sulfur. The
process is suitable for sulfur recovery from acid gas streams con-
taining less than 15% H2S. The acid gas stream is mixed with air and
passed over an alumina catalyst bed. H2S is directly oxidized to sulfur
at about 780 K. Depending on the feed gas composition and sulfur
recovery desired, a second direct oxidation reactor followed by a
conventional Claus reactor may be required [53]. Examples of com-
mercial technologies that use direct oxidation include Superclaus
and EuroClaus. The Superclaus catalyst is designed to yield a com-
plete and highly selective conversion of H2S to elemental sulfur,
reduced SO2 formation, and low sensitivity to water concentra-
tions in the process gas. The catalyst consists of active metal oxides
on a carrier. The catalyst produces H2S conversion to sulfur higher
than 85%, is not sensitive to excess air, is not sensitive to high water
concentrations, exhibits no Claus reaction, no CO/H2 oxidation, and
no formation of COS/CS2, and is chemically and thermally stable with
good mechanical strength and long effective life [50]. Two options
for the Superclaus process are the Superclaus 99 and the Superclaus
99.5. Superclaus 99 consists of a thermal stage followed by three
or four catalytic reactor stages, much like the Claus process. The first
two or three catalytic stages are loaded with the normal Claus cat-
alyst, while the final stage is loaded with the new selective oxidation
catalyst. In the Superclaus 99.5 process, a hydrogenation stage (using
a cobalt/molybdenum catalyst) between the last Claus reactor and
the selective oxidation reactor is incorporated. Sulfur recovery in
the Superclaus 99 process with 2 Claus stages is in the range of 98.9–
99.4% and in the range of 99.3–99.6% with 3 Claus stages. Sulfur
recovery in the Superclaus 99.5 process is in the range of 99.2–
99.6% with 2 Claus stages and 99.4–99.7% with 3 Claus stages, see
Koscielnuk et al. [50].

1.3.5.3. Reduction/Absorption/Recycle. In this process, H2S or SO2 is
absorbed in a regenerable solvent, which is then recycled into the
thermal stage of a Claus process. The absorption process occurs at
low pressure and various solvents are used (generic MDEA, Ucarsol,
Flexsorb). This technology reduces the tail-gas, wherein the front-
end of Claus sulfur recovery plant leaves back to H2S, then uses
selective amine absorption to remove the H2S and CO2, which is then
recycled back to the Claus plant. This technology allows a sulfur re-
covery efficiency of 99.5% [50]. Some commercial technologies
include SCOT from Shell, RAR from KTI, BSR/MDEA from Worley
Parson, HCR from Siritec Nigi, and Clintox from Linde.

1.3.5.4. Oxidation/Absorption/Recycle. This process involves burning
the tail gas so as to convert the sulfur species to SO2; this is then
absorbed in a proprietary chemical solvent. The SO2 is stripped from
the solvent and returned to the Claus plant feed. The process is an
emerging technology driven by CANSOLV and ClausMaster, see LaRue
et al. [49], which are oxidation/absorption/recycle alternatives to
conventional reduction/absorption/recycle types of tail-gas treat-
ment technologies. The sulfur compounds are initially oxidized to
SO2 by incineration and then partially cooled. An absorbent solu-
tion is then used to selectively absorb the SO2 from the tail-gas
oxidizer.

tion using H2S (Selim et al. [61]).

1.4. Sulfur chemistry in Claus thermal stage reactor

The efficiency of the Claus process and the quality of produced
sulfur can vary significantly depending on the acid gas composi-
tion, rector design configuration and operational conditions. Several
authors [2,60,61,69,70] have reported numerical data on the more
favorable operating temperature of the Claus thermal stage reactor
for maximum sulfur recovery and sulfur conversion efficiency using
H2S (see Fig. 3).

Acid gas composition varies significantly depending on the des-
ulfurization unit. The variation could become wider as the industry
shifts toward using heavier and sourer feedstock with higher content
of acid gas and other contaminants, due to depletion of light and
sweet feedstock. As a result, there is significant demand for im-
proved energy and sulfur recovery efficiency in both new and existing
gas processing plants and refineries, while reducing health and en-
vironmental burden. The composition of acid gas has significant effect
on the performance and efficiency of sulfur recovery in a Claus
reactor, as illustrated in Figs. 4–7. For example, the presence of aro-
matics in the acid gas increases the optimum operating temperature
of the thermal stage Claus reactor, while this optimum operating
temperature decreases with CO2 in the gas stream [71–73]. This is
because high temperatures favor thermal and chemical dissocia-
tion of CO2 (Equations (3) and (4)):

associated with H2S combustion would allow for the optimization
of Claus process plants. Other practical challenges associated with
the non-uniformity of acid gas feed streams is that the non-
uniformity decreases the Claus process efficiency significantly and
simultaneously increases the emissions [69]. Previous researchers
have identified the chemistry of the thermal stage of the reactor
as the least understood, but yet most capable of improving the
process efficiency [55,74].

Considerable efforts have been made to elucidate hydrogen sulfide
combustion with emphasis on the chemical kinetics and reaction
pathways of hydrogen sulfide combustion under different condi-
tions [73,74]. With the increased drive to minimize environmental
pollution from sulfur-bearing fuels, there is a renewed interest in
increasing the capacity of Claus process plants while developing al-
ternative ways of utilizing acid gas. Therefore, it is imperative to
provide a unified review of existing studies on the reaction chem-
istry, and Claus process operation for sulfur recovery from acid gas.

1.4.1. Experiments on H2S combustion

The combustion of H2S has been investigated experimentally and
reported in open literature. Merryman and Levy [75–79] reported
extensive studies on H2S and CS2 flames. They examined the oxi-
dation of hydrogen sulfide in a flat flame burner at low pressures
(0.1 and 0.05 atm) and measured the active intermediate species
(SO, S2O, SO2 and SO3) using a mass spectrometer. These studies re-
vealed that a change in the equivalence ratio from stoichiometric
to oxygen-rich conditions did not affect the SO radical, while mole
fractions of SO2 showed considerable decrease. They emphasized
that S2O is formed slightly before SO formation under oxygen-rich
conditions and suggested possible channels for SO formation in the
reaction pool. They also examined formation of sulfur trioxide in
staged combustion of CH4/H2S mixture in an effort to lower NOx emis-
sion during combustion [79]. However, a major drawback was the
high levels of CO produced in the first stage due to the lack of oxygen
or low reaction temperatures. There was no significant increase in
SO3 formation in the second stage compared to the single-stage com-
bustion process, and delaying the injection of secondary air reduced
SO3 formation considerably [80]. Merryman and Levy [76] also in-
vestigated COS combustion under low-pressure condition. They
divided COS flame into two distinct reaction zones: CO and SO2 were
formed in the first stage, while in the second zone oxidation of CO
to CO2 occurred.

Azatyan et al. [81] used an electron spin resonance technique
and gas chromatography to elucidate key aspects of sulfur chem-
istry. They examined the chemistry of H2S, CS2, sulfur vapor and COS
flames at low-pressures, and observed that H2S combustion occurs
through formation of H2, SO2 and SO in the first stage, and that SO2
formation relies significantly on SO radicals. In the second stage,
H2 oxidation occurs and OH radicals are formed. Bernez-Cambot et al.
[82] studied H2S diffusion flame and reported results that agreed
well with those of Azatyan et al. [81], except for the OH radicals,
which were not reported. Aztayan et al. [81] also examined sulfur
flames. They used a separate reactor to generate sulfur vapor used
in the experiments. It was observed that sulfur vapor oxidation pro-
duces significant amounts of atomic oxygen and SO in the reaction
pool. Examination of COS combustion under low-pressure condi-
tions further confirmed that COS combustion produced high amounts
of atomic oxygen and SO. Sharma et al. [83] and Liuti et al. [84] ex-
amined the chemistry of CS2 flames, and also observed that CS2
combustion helps release large quantities of atomic oxygen and SO.
It was observed that the SO mole fraction reaches its maximum
under stoichiometric conditions, while CS and atomic oxygen reached
minimum mole fractions. They attributed this to the formation of
intermediate compounds, such as COS.

Another striking observation common to both Aztyan et al. [81]
and Bernez-Cambot et al. [82] is that H2S is an inhibitor to H2

To improve the efficiency of the Claus process, understanding
the sulfur reaction chemistry, especially in the thermal stage reactor,
is crucial [3,55,60,61,72]. A better understanding of the chemistry

oxidation, which was also confirmed in studies by Selim [74]. This
observation was further explored in the work of Pierucci et al. [85],
who compared the contact times of pure H2S, H2 and CH4, and their
equimolar mixtures against the conversion of different fuels at reactor
temperature of 1500 K. They affirmed that H2S is more reactive than
H2 and CH4.

Tsuchiya and co-workers [86] studied H2S oxidation using laser
photolysis in a shock tube using atomic resonance absorption spec-
troscopy as the detection system. They focused on elementary
reactions that play prominent roles in H2S oxidation (Reactions
(5)–(7)):

They revealed that Reaction (5) could yield several products that
include HSO + O, SO + OH, SO2 + H, and HO2 + S. The findings from
this reaction are rather controversial in most H2S combustion mecha-
nisms because of several different products that could be produced
from this reaction. They computed kinetic parameters for the three
reactions, considering HSO + O as the products from Reaction 5, and
compared the Arrhenius plots with literature data. An adopted re-
action mechanism of H2S combustion consisting of 30 elementary
reactions was then obtained.

To further understand the sulfur chemistry in flames, research-
ers have also sought to understand the role of intermediate species
in the combustion chemistry of H2S. This effort has provided sig-
nificant insight into the various reaction pathways involved. Dagnall
et al. [87] and Selim et al. [88] used a non-intrusive examination
of excited species during chemiluminescence. The phenomenon of
chemiluminescence is the result of the chemi-excitation process,
which involves increasing the total energy of a molecule by means
of a chemical reaction, causing light emission. Identifying the char-
acteristic spectrum associated with various species (intermediate
or stable) has improved the understanding of flame chemistry, es-
pecially in hydrocarbon combustion [87]. It is recognized that
interpretation of the signal from chemiluminescence is not simple,
since it involves both temperature and chemical effects. Nonethe-
less, in a uniform reactor it can provide some useful information
without disturbing the flow.

Lewis et al. [89] examined HS absorption bands. They gener-
ated HS radicals by passing pulses of radio frequency current to H2S,
and then synchronized the radio frequency pluses to immediately
precede the flashlight to be absorbed by HS. A band of HS absorp-
tion was detected at 323.7 nm wavelength. Muller et al. [90] then
measured concentrations of HS, S2, SO, SO2, and OH radicals using
quantitative laser fluorescence. Fuwa et al. [91,92] used an atomic
absorption instrument to detect the presence of SO2 ultraviolet ab-
sorption bands. The setup consisted of a light source, absorption cell,
burner, light dispersing elements and detectors. They showed the
presence of strong absorption bands of SO2 in the range of 200–
230 nm and 250–300 nm.

Toyoda et al. [93] reported experimental data on the emission
spectra of CS2, H2S and other non-sulfurous compounds. They used
a heated tungsten filament as an electron source in a controlled elec-
tron beam to excite the species examined. The emission spectra of
CS2 showed more intense bands at 282 nm and 285 nm, while strong
bands of H2S at 486, 434, 410, 397 and 389 nm were attributed to
a hydrogen Balmer series. Their results are shown in Fig. 8.

Fowler et al. [94] examined the spectrum of carbon disulfide,
sulfur and hydrogen sulfide flames, and showed that CS2 flame emis-
sions extend from the ultraviolet to blue wavelength. They attributed
the formation of these bands to S2 and SO species. Sulfur bands were

found to be absorption bands, but they were obtained as emitting
bands when a stream of oxygen was directed into the flame. They
also examined sulfur and hydrogen sulfide flame spectra, which
showed a spectrum similar to that of CS2 flame. They observed the
formation of OH bands in hydrogen sulfide flames.

Gaydon and coworkers [95–97] examined the spectra of hydro-
carbon flames containing small amounts of SO2 and SO3. They
reported bands for SH, CS, S2 and SO radicals, and elaborated on the
formation mechanisms of observed species. A strong ultraviolet emis-
sion band observed in the flame spectra in the range of 382.8–
469.9 nm (sulfur dioxide afterglow) was attributed to the reaction
of sulfur dioxide and atomic oxygen to form sulfur trioxide, see
Gaydon and Whittingham [95].

Selim et al. [88] examined the spectra of H2S/O2 and H2/H2S/air
flames under near stoichiometric condition. They observed sulfur
dioxide afterglow in both the flames. Their results revealed the for-
mation of a strong bluish inner cone located near the flame base
on injection of trace amounts H2S into H2/air flames, as shown in
Fig. 9.

The inner cone showed a strong group of peaks between 320 and
470 nm. These peaks were grouped into the SO* band within 320–
350 nm, SO3* and H* bands beyond 350 nm and HS absorption bands
at 324.03 and 328.62 nm. These chemiluminescence results showed
only a momentary presence of radical species in the combustion
process, but observed intensities did not relate to species concen-
trations due to the absence of thermal excitation.

1.4.2. Kinetic studies on H2S pyrolysis

Pyrolysis of H2S occurs at the initial stage of the combustion
process in a Claus furnace. In an effort to obtain better kinetic models
of H2S combustion, previous researchers have examined the kinet-
ics of H2S pyrolysis [98,99]. However, some of these studies examined
alternative ways of utilizing acid gas through non-catalytic thermal
decomposition of H2S to produce hydrogen and elemental sulfur [98]:

Most studies focused on the kinetics of both the forward and
reverse reactions over a wide range of temperatures. Several re-
search groups derived chemical kinetics rates of H2S dissociation
over a wide range of temperatures, residence times, and pressures
[100–102]. Others studied hydrogen sulfide dissociation in the pres-
ence of catalysts (alumina or molybdenum) to favor higher
conversion of the endothermic dissociation rates of H2S [98,103].
These studies were also partly motivated from the need to op-
timize sulfur recovery through modeling of the Claus reaction furnace
and associated waste heat boiler [104,105]. Kaloidas and
Papayannakos [106] examined the kinetics of reverse Reaction (8).
They implicitly relied on the available kinetic models within the lit-
erature, wherein they used first-order kinetics for the H2S
decomposition reaction, of the form −d[H2]/dt) = k[H2][S2]1/2, for the
rate expression of the reverse H2/S2 reaction proposed by Aynsley

et al. [107] at lower temperatures. The high-temperature decom-
position of H2S was also reported by Raymont [98], Fukuda et al.
[103], Randall and Bichowsky [108] and Chivers et al. [109]. However,
investigation of the direct reaction between hydrogen and sulfur
is only reported in the literature at lower temperatures [110,111].
It was noted that these studies did not show any agreement in the
reported order of reaction. For instance, Darwent and Roberts (in
Raymont [98]) showed a second-order dependency on H2S for the
rate of decomposition reaction, whereas both Raymont [112] and
Adesina et al. [113] have suggested first-order kinetics. In light of
the apparent lack of agreement on the kinetics of this system, a re-
evaluation of the kinetic data for the H2/S2 reaction reported in the
study by Dowling et al. [114] was undertaken. They extended this
study to Claus process conditions (high temperature range of 875–
1700 K and residence time between 0.03 and 1.5 s), and reported
first-order dependence on both hydrogen and sulfur for the revers-
ible homogenous gas-phase kinetics of H2S decomposition to produce
hydrogen and sulfur. Dowling et al. [114] reported an experimen-
tal rate expression for Reaction (14) (−d[H2]/dt) = k[H2][S2]), different
from that used by Kaloidas and Papayannakos [106]. A reversible
kinetic treatment of the system was also performed, which in-
cluded the assumption of strict first-order kinetics for H2S
decomposition and pseudo-first order behavior for the H2/S2 reac-
tion. Dowling et al. also showed the feasibility of using a rapid
thermal quench technique to minimize the reverse reaction of H2S
decomposition (Reaction (8)), which was also suggested by Chen
et al. [115]. Despite this type of scrutiny, the reported studies thus
far have not provided a unified picture of the overall kinetics within
this system, often yielding conflicting results even as to the form
of rate expressions and reaction order.

Monnery et al. [116,117] examined key reactions of H2S under
Claus process conditions. They studied the reaction between H2S
and SO2, which is highly important in the Claus process, using an
isothermal reactor over a wide temperature range of 1123–1400 K
and residence times of 0.05–1.2 s, and developed a kinetic rate ex-
pression for SO2 reaction with H2S. They similarly investigated the
rate of pyrolysis and oxidation of ammonia in the Claus process [117].
Slimane et al. [118] examined numerically the partial combus-
tion of different acid gas compositions and oxidizers (20% H2S, 80%
N2)/air, (20% H2S, 80% N2)/O2, 100% H2S/air, 100% H2S/O2, (25% H2S,
75% N2)/air, and (25% H2S, 75% N2)/O2, under super-adiabatic con-
ditions. The major focus of their work was to optimize the yield of
H2 for the conditions examined. They revealed that high H2 and low
SO2 yields were more favorable at equivalence ratios above 6.

Montoya et al. [119] conducted quantum chemical calculations to
study the interaction between H2S and molecular oxygen. They used
the chemical bond lengths to define possible isomers from [H2/S/
O2] that are favorable during H2S and O2 reactions.

Binoist and co-workers [102] studied pyrolysis of H2S in diluted
argon using a continuous and perfectly mixed reactor, at resi-
dence times of 0.4–1.6 s and temperature ranges of 1073–1373 K.
They reported a detailed kinetic mechanism for H2S pyrolysis that
consisted of 22 reactions. Manenti et al. [120] also reported a de-
tailed kinetic mechanism for pyrolysis and oxidation of sulfur
compounds, and validated it against literature and industrial data
acquired from different Claus reactor plants. It was noted that this
mechanism accounted for the presence of light hydrocarbons,
ammonia and other species that are often present in acid gases.

1.4.3. Reaction mechanisms of H2S combustion

Several reaction mechanisms of hydrogen sulfide combustion
have been proposed in the open literature. Norrish et al. [121] studied
the mechanism of H2S combustion using spectroscopy and flash pho-
tolysis. They proposed a reaction mechanism consisting of 13
elementary reactions, and highlighted the significance of HS and
OH radicals to H2S combustion. This mechanism includes several
steps: initiation, chain propagation and branching, and chain ter-
mination. Levy et al. [122] examined H2S/O2/N2 flames in a flat
burner, and reported an extended version of the 13 elementary re-
action mechanism proposed by Norrish et al. [121] up to 18
elementary reactions. They also affirmed the importance of ele-
mentary reactions involving HS radicals in the overall chemistry of
H2S combustion. Muller et al. [123] studied sulfur chemistry in fuel-
rich H2/O2/N2 flames with addition of 0.25, 0.5 and 1% of H2S in the
mixture. They used a quantitative laser fluorescence technique to
quantify HS, S2, SO, SO2, and OH species that provided a basis to
propose a mechanism of 36 elementary reactions. Frenklach et al.
[124] investigated experimentally the oxidation of H2S and igni-
tion delay using reflected shock waves. They reported a reaction
mechanism for H2S oxidation that consisted of 17 species and 57
elementary reactions.

Cerru and co-workers [125,126] proposed a more detailed re-
action mechanism, consisting of 12 species and 70 elementary
reactions for H2S pyrolysis and oxidation in both laminar and tur-
bulent flames. The mechanism under-predicted SO2 by ~31% and
ignition delay time by ~35%. They also reduced the detailed mech-
anism using a sensitivity analysis approach and implemented steady
state assumption for minor species that included HSO, HOSO, HOSO2,

76

A.K. Gupta et al./Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 54 (2016) 65–92

H2S2, and S. They obtained a 6-step reaction mechanism that was
compared to their detailed mechanism and other experimental data
from the literature. A good agreement was obtained under most of
the reaction conditions examined. Selim and co-workers [61] imple-
mented an error propagation approach to reduce the detailed
reaction mechanism of Leeds University [127] which consists of 111
reactions and 41 species. Their comprehensive strategy reduced 111
detailed reaction mechanisms down to 19 reactions with maximum
error of 16%.

Blitz et al. [128] and Hughes et al. [129,130] developed de-
tailed reaction mechanisms of H2S combustion. Blitz et al. [128]
examined the reaction between two important intermediate species
of H2S combustion (OH and SO). They calculated the reaction rate
coefficient of the OH reaction with SO over a temperature range of
295–703 K, using laser flash photolysis coupled with laser-induced
fluorescence (LIF). They revealed that the reaction of OH/SO occurs
in several steps, starting with the formation of HOSO, which is most
likely to produce SO2 and H. Isomerization of HOSO results in the
formation of HSO2, which decomposes rapidly to form H and SO2.
However, the steps leading to the end products of the OH/SO re-
actions were ambiguous and needed further clarification, so Hughes
et al. [129] determined numerically the reaction rate coefficients
of all the intermediate steps that were ambiguous. They tested the
reaction rate coefficients over a wide range of temperatures (300–
2000 K) and pressures (10−3–106 atm). In another work, Hughes et al.
[130], the authors examined premixed methane flames doped with
sulfur and nitrogen. They modified their initial sulfur mechanism
until a final version consisting of 111 reactions and 41 species was
compiled [127]. This mechanism accounts for the presence of
methane and nitrous oxides. Methane and ammonia are often
present as impurities in acid and will be discussed extensively.

Zachariah et al. [131] examined the flame structure of H2/SO2/
O2 at equivalence ratios from 1.35 to 2.4 and low-pressure condition
using numerical and experimental methods. The numerical pre-
dictions were conducted using a reaction mechanism that consisted
of 44 chemical reactions and 17 species, which showed good agree-
ment with the experimental data, except for H2S mole fractions,
which were under predicted by about 35%, and HS, which was over-
predicted by about 60%. Chernysheva et al. [132] investigated the
H2S reaction with oxygen under stoichiometric conditions. They de-
veloped a detailed reaction mechanism of H2S combustion that
contained 201 reactions and 23 species. Their mechanism showed
qualitative agreement with most of the experimental data. Sendt
et al. [133] reported a detailed mechanism for an H2—S2—H2S
system. This mechanism consisted of 21 reactions and was vali-
dated over a wide range of temperatures (873–1723 K) and pressures
(0.04–3 bar).

1.5. Role of acid gas impurities on sulfur chemistry

The reaction mechanisms for H2S combustion developed thus far
do not adequately account for all other gases (impurities) that often
accompany acid gas. Therefore, these kinetic models do not ade-
quately capture the complex sulfur chemistry that occurs in acid
gas conversion process. Acid gas impurities alter the sulfur chem-
istry and reduce the efficiency of Claus sulfur plants.

1.5.1. Role of CO2, N2, CH4 and C3H8

Numerical and experimental results have been reported on the
role of contaminants (CO2, N2, CH4 and mercaptans) in hydrogen
sulfide combustion. Khudenko et al. [54] studied the effect of air
enrichment with oxygen and air by oxygen–air–water oxidizers for
the treatment of acid gases (H2S and CO2). They found that oxygen
enrichment reduces the equipment size and provides sufficiently
higher sulfur recovery in comparison to the conventional Claus
process. Conversely, enrichment by oxygen–air–water oxidizers

Fig. 10. Conversion of efficiency vs. CO2 concentration in H2S/CO2 mixture (Selim
et al. [72]).

causes a decrease in sulfur recovery through dissociation of water
into hydroxyl groups, which enhances SO2 production.

Selim et al. [59,60,72,74,134–136] reported extensive experi-
mental results on the chemical kinetic pathways of acid gas (H2S
and CO2) combustion under various conditions. They examined the
effect of different contaminants (CO2 and N2) on the optimum op-
erating temperature of a Claus reactor in the thermal stage, both
numerically and experimentally [72,134]. The results revealed that
carbon dioxide affects the reaction chemistry significantly, which
impacts the conversion efficiency, as shown in Fig. 10.

Conversion efficiency is defined as mass of sulfur recovered
divided by the mass of inlet sulfur. They showed that at low tem-
perature, CO2 and N2 act as inert gases, reducing the optimum
operating temperature by reducing the reactant’s partial pressure.
Conversely, at high temperature CO2 enhanced the oxidizing medium,
which reduces the efficiency of the Claus process considerably.
However, nitrogen acted as an inert gas, reducing the reactant’s
partial pressure, which did not affect the performance of the Claus
process significantly. Also, these authors examined the sulfur chem-
istry with the acid gas (H2S and CO2) addition in H2/air flames at
different equivalence ratios [136]. They found that the presence of
CO2 enhances the oxidizing medium of the reaction pool while si-
multaneously promoting formation of carbonaceous–sulfurous
compounds (Fig. 11). These compounds have a negative effect on
the performance of the Claus process.

Selim et al. [59] also studied hydrogen sulfide combustion in
methane/air flame at three different equivalence ratios of 0.5, 1 and
3 that represent fuel lean, stoichiometric and rich conditions, re-
spectively. They revealed that in the presence of oxygen, oxidation
of hydrogen sulfide forms SO2, while the depletion of oxidant (Claus
conditions) favors the formation of elemental sulfur. However, higher
hydrocarbons were formed in trace amounts under Claus condi-
tions wherein sulfur dioxide acted as a coupling catalyst, which

Chin et al. [138] studied the oxidation of H2S and H2S—CH4 mix-
tures in a tubular reactor over a temperature range of 1273–
1473 K and residence time of 100–1200 ms. They reported that H2S
consumption is faster in the presence of methane, while the amounts
of SO2 formation decreased. Their results also revealed that methane
is less competitive for oxygen than H2S, which results in methane
reacting with other major sulfur-containing species to form carbon
disulfide. In the same work, they examined the reaction of methane
with sulfur dioxide to determine if this reaction is directly respon-
sible for COS formation. They concluded that COS is not a direct
product of reaction between methane and sulfur dioxide; rather,
methane is partially oxidized to CO, which then provides the channel
for COS formation.

Smith et al. [139] examined CO/O2/Ar flames with addition of
trace amounts of SO2. They determined the kinetic parameters of
SO3 elementary reactions. Glarborg et al. [140] and Alzueta et al.
[141] reported experimental and numerical findings on the effect
of SO2 to CO oxidation, and later, Dagaut et al. [142] examined NO
and SO2 addition effects to CO—H2 mixtures. They conjectured that
SO2 inhibits oxidation of CO and CO—H2 and that the inhibition rate
is more severe under fuel-rich condition. This was attributed to the
observation that SO2 acts as radical sink in the reaction pool, where
it favors radical recombination. They also compared their experi-
mental results with numerical data, which was obtained using an
adopted reaction mechanism that consisted of 67 elementary re-
actions and 23 species.

1.5.2. Role of ammonia on sulfur chemistry

Oxidation and pyrolysis of ammonia occur in the thermal stage
of Claus reactors. Studies have shown that the oxidation of NH3 is
a much more rapid process than pyrolysis [117]. These investiga-
tors reported global kinetic rate expressions for the pyrolysis and
oxidation of NH3 under conditions encountered in the Claus furnace.
They reported that conversion of NH3 through oxidation varied
between 1 and 50% for temperatures between 1123 and 1223 K and
50–700 ms, whereas pyrolysis conversions at these conditions never
exceeded 20%. They calculated global kinetic parameters for ammonia
oxidation and pyrolysis that were also used to simulate experi-
ments performed by Clark et al. [57], and the model predictions
agreed well with their data. The results also showed that ammonia
pyrolysis accounts for significant destruction, but there appears to
be an inhibition of ammonia pyrolysis when a significant amount
of water is present. Clark et al. [57] conducted a study on NH3 py-
rolysis at Claus conditions to determine the effects of other chemical
species occurring at different furnace temperatures, pressures, and
residence times. In general, both H2S and H2O were found to inhibit
NH3 pyrolysis, whereas SO2 enhances NH3 pyrolysis. Their results
also showed oxidation being much more rapid than pyrolysis.

Several other studies have been reported on ammonia oxida-
tion and pyrolysis under various operating conditions not
encountered in Claus furnace [143–147]. These studies are partic-
ularly useful for improving available H2S kinetic mechanisms to
account for the oxidation and pyrolysis of NH3 that is often present
as impurity in acid gas. Fujii et al. [144] examined the reaction of
ammonia oxidation at temperatures between 810 and 2100 K, and
pressures from 1.1 to 8.4 atm under lean and rich conditions. Miller
et al. [143] used a reaction model consisting of 98 reactions to eval-
uate the reaction mechanism for NH3 oxidation. Experimental data
reported by MacLean and Wagner [145] were used to validate the
model predictions, which were in good agreement for the lean to
moderately rich gases. However, for the rich flames, the agree-
ment was poor, possibly indicating inadequate modeling of ammonia
pyrolysis. The model and experimental results also showed very low
concentrations (approximately 0.001 mole fraction) of NO in the
post-flame gases. Lindstedt and Skevis [148] and Selim et al.
[134,135] proposed a reaction mechanism consisting of five steps

Fig. 12. Formation of COS and CS2 at equivalence ratio of 3 (Selim et al. [59]).

enhanced the dimerization of the CH3 radical to form higher series
of hydrocarbons, as illustrated in Fig. 12.

Under Claus conditions, sulfur deposits were formed in low tem-
perature regions of the reactor, including the sampling line. Selim
et al. [59] analyzed the deposits using an X-ray powder diffractometer
that showed cyclo-S8 (α-sulfur) with orthorhombic crystal struc-
ture. They attributed the formation of α-sulfur to the agglomeration
of elemental sulfur (S2) during its condensation at low temperatures.
In another investigation, Selim et al. [60] examined the effect of
contaminants (CO2, CH4 and C3H8) on the quality of sulfur deposits
collected from hydrogen sulfide combustion under fuel-rich (Claus)
and stoichiometric conditions. They collected sulfur deposits from
H2S combustion under various conditions and analyzed them using
X-ray powder diffraction and laser induced breakdown spectros-
copy (LIBS). Results from LIBS experiments revealed that equivalence
ratio of H2S/O2 flame did not have a significant impact on the quality
of the captured sulfur. Similarly, the presence of CO2 in the acid gas
stream showed an insignificant effect on the deposited sulfur.
However, sulfur deposits from combustion of hydrogen sulfide in
methane and propane showed traces of carbon (soot) to directly
impact the quality of sulfur produced, as depicted in Fig. 13. Com-
pared to methane, the concentration of carbon was higher with
propane.

Arutyonov et al. [137] examined the oxidation of 10% CH4 and
10% H2S with 5% O2 in diluted N2 in a quartz reactor at tempera-
tures lower than 800 K and high residence time, on the order of tens
of minutes. They found that H2S was completely oxidized within a
temperature range of 700–800 K, while at lower temperatures in-
complete conversion of H2S was observed, but no quantitative
analysis on methane conversion was reported.

based on experimental data generated by MacLean and Wagner [145]
and Vandooren [146]. These studies [148,149] were based on flame
experiments and did not report on the actual temperatures.

Several other studies focused on the reduction of NO by NH3 in
NH3—NO—O2 systems. Lyon and Benn (in Monnery et al. [148] and
Miller and Bowman [149]) conducted a kinetic study of the reduc-
tion of NO by NH3 in the presence of O2 at temperatures between
1125 and 1250 K and pressures between 1.07 and 2.14 atm. Addi-
tion of NH3 was effective in reducing NO at all temperatures and
pressures and high amounts of O2/NO ratio. However, the reduc-
tion of NO was inhibited when NH3 concentration was equal to O2.
Miller and Bowman [149] reported similar conclusions, and in ad-
dition Roubaud et al. [150] and Davidson et al. [151] found that the
process occurs in the narrow temperature range of 1100–1400 K
in the absence of other additives. They also reported the inhibit-
ing effect of H2O on NO reduction. Dou et al. [152] proposed a simple
kinetic model that predicted the rate of NO and NH3 conversion in
the NO—NH3—O2 system. They indicated that NH3 conversion in-
creases with temperature, whereas NO conversion increases with
temperature until approximately 1200 K, after which conversion de-
creases. Dou et al. [152] also noted that longer residence times have
minimal effect on NO conversion. In their experiments, O2 was in
excess. Clark et al. [57] performed oxidation studies on NH3 at res-
idence times between 0.34 and 0.55 s and inlet concentrations of
NH3 and O2 of 4 and 3%. The results showed that between 973 and
1373 K, conversion of NH3 was below 10%, whereas the conver-
sion increased to between 60 and 100% at temperatures above
1373 K.

A series of pyrolysis experiments was performed behind re-
flected shock waves by Davidson et al. [151] over a temperature range
of 2000–3200 K, pressure range of 0.8–1.1 atm, and an NH3 con-
centration range of 0.1–1.0%. The results showed complete
consumption of NH3 within a 1 ms residence time. They proposed
a detailed reaction mechanism consisting of 21 free-radical reactions.
Ammonia combustion results in the formation of undesired by-
products, such as NOx. However, with abundant SO2 in the Claus
furnace, NO creates a channel for the formation of SO3. Formation
of SO3 leads to ammonium salt formation, such as NH4HSO4 and
(NH4)2SO4. Some of these reactions are shown in reactions (9)–
(15) [117,153]. This often causes severe downstream problems, such
as salt deposition, corrosion, and catalyst deactivation. Moreover,
burned NH3 produces significant amounts of N2, which tends to limit
the Claus reaction between SO2 and H2S to form elemental sulfur
due to dilution. Reactions involving ammonia that occur in the Claus
furnace are complex and not fully understood, and the destruc-
tion of NH3 is governed by kinetics rather than equilibrium [57,154].

tration in acid gas.

presence of NO in the beds acts as a catalyst for the conversion of
SO2 to SO3, which in turn causes catalyst sulfation [153]. Catalyst
sulfation is regarded as the most significant primary cause of cat-
alyst deactivation [155].

1.5.3. Role of benzene, toluene and xylene

Benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX) originating from crude oil and
natural gas wells are major components of practical hydrocarbon
fuels, such as gasoline, diesel oil and kerosene [156–158]. BTX causes
severe technical and environmental problems to Claus process plants.
Xylene is capable of deactivating Claus catalysts much faster than
benzene or toluene (Crevier et al. [64,65]). The deactivation of Claus
catalyst is directly proportional to the concentration of BTX in the
feed stream (Fig. 14). Xylene has a more severe effect on carbon de-
position on the pores of Claus catalysts, as depicted in Fig. 15.
However, in the thermal stage reactor, xylene is expected to behave
much differently during thermal oxidation, unlike toluene and
benzene. The combustion properties of xylene are much different
from those of benzene and toluene [159–163]. Xylene exhibits a
higher reactivity than toluene and benzene during thermal oxida-
tion, and flames of aromatic compounds are highly sensitive to fuel-
specific chemistry [164–169]. The reaction kinetics of the first few

The desired NH3 destruction reactions in the furnace are the com-
plete pyrolysis and/or oxidation to N2, H2, and H2O. Incomplete
pyrolysis or combustion of NH3 in the furnace results in NH3 and
NO carryover into the catalyst beds. Although the formation of SO3
occurs in the catalyst bed regardless of the presence of NO, the

intermediates formed in the thermal oxidation and pyrolysis process
that follows the initial fuel consumption is critical [170–173].

Xylene is expected to have a more severe impact on sulfur chem-
istry in the Claus reactor than toluene or benzene, due to higher
reactivity and generation of intermediate products. There are limited
data on the combustion of H2S and BTX mixtures, especially under
partially oxidizing conditions. Most data available in the open lit-
erature are on the oxidation and pyrolysis of either neat BTX or H2S.
An evaluation of experimental data on benzene oxidation and py-
rolysis was reported by Vourliotakis et al. [174]. Early studies on
the development of benzene oxidation models were conducted by
Bittker [175], who proposed a simplified mechanism to predict the
ignition delay time measurements of Burcat et al. [176,177] and the
flow reactor data of Lovell et al. [178,179]. Several other kinetic
mechanisms of benzene oxidation have been reported in the open
literature, most of which are on the basis of the flame data of Bittner
and Howard (Shandross et al. [180], Dupont et al. [181], Tan and
Frank [182], Chai and Pfefferle [183], Zhang and McKinnon [184],
Ristori et al. [185], Detilleux and Vandoore [186], Sivaramakarishnan
et al. [187,188]). There are far more studies on toluene oxidation
and pyrolysis than on toluene and benzene. A review of experi-
mental data on toluene oxidation and pyrolysis was evaluated by
Yuan et al. [189]. The vast amount of data include global combus-
tion parameters, such as ignition delay times, laminar flame speeds
and species profiles in shock tube, flow reactor and low pressure
premixed laminar flames, and several kinetic mechanisms (Sakai

et al. [190], Dagaut et al. [191], Lindstedt and Maurice [192], Colket
and Seery [193], Zhang et al. [194], Lannuzel et al. [195], Detilleux
and Vandooren [196], Klotz et al. [197], Emdee et al. [160], Brezinsky
et al. [198]. Metcalfe et al. [199], Narayanswamy et al. [200], and
El Bekali et al. [201]). The available kinetic mechanisms on neat BTX
destruction will help researchers to better understand the reac-
tion pathways of BTX and H2S mixtures during thermal
decomposition.

Ibrahim et al. [202–207] reported experimental data on the effect
of trace amounts of toluene (0%, 0.5%, 1% and 5%), benzene (0.3%,
0.5% and 1%) or xylene (0.5%, 1% and 2%) added to H2S/O2 flames,
investigated at an equivalence ratio of three (i.e., under Claus con-
dition). Addition of xylene to H2S increased the reactor temperature
and altered the product speciation of H2S combustion that re-
sulted in decreased sulfur conversion efficiency of H2S in the thermal
stage of the Claus reactor (Figs. 16 and 17). The product speciation
revealed significant production of H2 that hindered H2S conver-
sion and decreased SO2 production with subsequent reduced
formation of elemental sulfur in the thermal stage.

The formed radicals from initial xylene decomposition played
a prominent role in H2S oxidation. The amounts of H2S at the reactor
exit were higher with toluene addition than with benzene and
xylene, which was attributed to the chemistry of intermediate
byproducts formed in the combustion process. Additionally, pro-
duced SO2 tended to provide oxidizer for the oxidation of
intermediate species, such as CO, COS, CS2 and CH4, in the Claus

reactor that varied with the type and trace amounts of aromatic im-
purity (benzene, toluene or xylene) in the feed stream. The work
of Sinha et al. [208,209] further supported these findings. Sinha et al.
[208,209] reported theoretical data on the destruction of benzene
and toluene by SO2 in the thermal stage of the Claus furnace. They
observed that SO2 is energetically favored to react with BTX to result
in SO formation. The relative effect of benzene, toluene and xylene
on sulfur recovery was dependent on the production of interme-
diate species in the combustion process. Toluene addition promoted
higher amounts of H2, CO and COS production than benzene
(Figs. 18–20). Thermal decomposition of xylene occurs through
thermal or chemical initiation by active radicals (such as H, OH, S,
HS) in the reactor. This results in H-abstraction or methyl radical
formation, which leads to H2 and CH4 formation in the reactor. Other
reaction intermediates are toluene, which decompose in similar
manner to yield benzene.

Formation of CO occurred through the oxidation of methyl radical
and via phenoxy species from methyl-benzyl, benzyl and phenyl
radical oxidation. The faster reactivity of xylene compared to toluene
was evident in the higher mole fractions of produced CO. Forma-
tion of CO with toluene or benzene addition occurred at the initial
stage of combustion, but it was rapidly oxidized further down-
stream in the reactor. However, CO formation significantly increased
with xylene/H2S combustion. This is directly attributed to the role
of the first few intermediate radicals formed during initial stage of

xylene decomposition, which increased the number of mechanis-
tic pathways on CO formation.

Benzene showed more severely reduced SO2 to directly hinder
the formation of elemental sulfur. Xylene had the least impact on
SO2 reduction. Production of SO2 was higher with xylene than with
toluene and benzene, to favor elemental sulfur production. The rel-
ative effect of benzene, toluene and xylene on sulfur conversion in
the thermal stage of the Claus reactor decreases in the order of
xylene < toluene < benzene.

However, xylene causes the Claus catalyst to deactivate more
quickly in the catalytic stage of reactors compared to toluene and
benzene due to the increased processing load, from significant pro-
duction of byproducts (H2, CH4, CO, COS and CS2) in the thermal stage.
This causes several technical problems for the Claus process plant
that can result in plant shut-down, reduced sulfur recovery effi-
ciency, faster catalyst deactivation and higher operational costs.
However, production of hydrogen and methane are also potential-
ly value-added products during sulfur recovery under favorable
conditions. This will further enhance the feasibility of direct hy-
drogen or syngas production from acid gas. Simulation results have
shown that direct production of different syngas compositions (H2
to CO ratio) and sulfur is possible while minimizing formation of
other sulfurous compounds, such as SO2 and COS [99]. These find-
ings further substantiate the need for more efficient means of
ammonia and BTX destruction in the thermal stage to prevent

spillover of contaminants into the catalytic reactors and mitigate
COS and CS2 formation in thermal stage.

There are three major parameters that control the destruction
of feed stream contaminants in Claus reactors: temperature, mixing
and residence time (often called the rule of 3 Ts). Temperature is
the most important parameter, and mixing is essential to ensure
that all the contaminant molecules reach a high enough tempera-
ture to enhance the Claus reactions. Residence time is important,
particularly to sulfur forming reactions, as is maintaining a stable
flame at the burner. However, if the feed gas contains contami-
nants, a much higher flame temperature is required to ensure
complete destruction of the undesirable compounds in the furnace
so that they do not cause operational difficulties in the catalytic
stages.

Ibrahim et al. [203,206,207] conducted investigations to under-
stand the role of oxygen enrichment in combustion air on the
destruction of different acid gas mixtures in H2/O2—N2 flames. Three
different percentages of oxygen enrichment of air were examined
(0, 19.5 and 69.3%) for different acid gas compositions that con-
sisted of 100% H2S, 1% C7H8/99% H2S, 1% C8H10/99% H2S and 50% H2S/
50% CO2 gas mixtures [207]. Combustion of 100% H2S acid gas using
oxygen enriched air resulted in increased SO2 formation that cor-
responded to increase in H2S and decrease in H2 oxidation. These
trends are attributed to increase in temperatures with increased
oxygen concentration in the combustion air.

Examination of toluene and H2S mixtures showed a faster rate
of H2S and a slower rate of H2 decomposition with an increase in
the percentage of oxygen enrichment to air. Toluene addition en-
hanced SO2 production while increasing the possibility of sulfur
recovery. Oxygen enrichment to air showed enhanced destruction
of hydrocarbons while minimizing the formation of carbon disul-
fide (CS2).

Combustion of xylene and H2S mixture revealed quantitative dif-
ferences in mole fractions of combustion products, but the trends
of species concentration profiles were similar to those observed with
toluene. Increase in oxygen enrichment to combustion air also
favored xylene destruction to minimize carbon disulfide produc-
tion. The amounts of hydrocarbons, sulfur dioxide, carbon disulfide,
and hydrogen production at the reactor exit increased more with
xylene than with toluene. This was attributed to the fact that xylene
decomposition is a hierarchical process that occurs via toluene and
benzene formation.

Acid gas (H2S and CO2) combustion also showed an increased rate
of H2S and H2 oxidation with different concentrations of oxygen in
combustion air. Carbon dioxide decomposed at high temperature
to form CO and atomic oxygen, and this favored formation of SO2

at the expense of more desirable elemental sulfur (Fig. 21). Forma-
tion of SO2 also hindered CO oxidation due the preferential oxidation
of SO radicals to SO2, which then favored COS and CS2 production.
A higher percentage of oxygen enrichment further promoted CO pro-
duction, but significantly decreased CS2, while promoting COS
formation. In addition, the formed SO and SO2 also provided oxi-
dation competition for CO to favor significant quantities of CO
production at the reactor exit. These results demonstrated the ef-
fectiveness of oxygen enrichment in mitigating the role of trace
impurities in H2S and also sulfur emissions from sulfur recovery
plants.

Ibrahim et al. [206,207] characterized and evaluated products
from the combustion of acid gas (consisting of H2S, CO2, C7H8 and
C8H10) in H2/O2—N2 flame, so as to isolate the combined effect of CO2
and BTX to H2S. This study represented a more practical acid gas
composition. Combustion of H2S gas resulted in the decomposi-
tion of H2S to increase SO2 mole fractions to an asymptotic maximum
value (Fig. 22).

Combustion of toluene and H2S mixture caused faster H2S oxi-
dation and SO2 formation, but the formed SO2 decomposed to
increase the possibility of elemental sulfur formation. In contrast,
combustion of toluene and acid gas (H2S and CO2) mixture showed
increased formation of SO2 throughout the reactor, as CO2 en-
hanced the oxidizing medium (Fig. 22). Toluene alone directly
contributed to the formation of CH4, C2H2 and CS2 in the reactor, while
both toluene and CO2 caused increased formation of mercaptans (CS2
and COS), but enhanced destruction of formed hydrocarbons (CH4
and C2H2). A significant amount of CO was produced, which was at-
tributed to the oxidation competition between CO and SO radicals
and SO2. Combustion of xylene, H2S and CO2 mixtures showed similar
qualitative trends on species concentration profiles, but signifi-
cant quantitative differences were observed compared to those with
toluene. Xylene showed a more significant impact on the in-
creased production of methane, acetylene, COS and CS2 in the reactor.
This was attributed to the faster reactivity of xylene and in-
creased radical production during the initial stage of decomposition,
due to the two methyl group radicals present in xylene. Increased
production of acetylene and methane with xylene can cause severe
problems in the downstream catalytic stages of the Claus process,
and production of COS and CS2 increases sulfur emissions, as illus-
trated in Fig. 23.

Xylene decomposition is initiated by collision with another mol-
ecule (M and/or H, S, SH, SH, O and OH) in the reactor [210,211].
This results in methyl radical formation or, more favorably, hydro-
gen atom removal from xylene (H-abstraction). Eventually, toluene
is formed via a radical–radical recombination once xylene

decomposition is initiated, and in similar steps, benzene is formed
from toluene (Dames et al. [212]). Benzene also undergoes
H-abstraction to form C6H5 radical; see examples shown in reac-
tions (26)–(30) (Wang et al. [213], Hippler et al. [214]).

A radical recombination of CH3 with another radical yields CH4,
which is partly responsible for the observed increase in CH4 mole
fractions at lower residence time in the reactor. Methyl-benzyl
(CH3C6H4CH2), benzyl (C6H5CH2) and phenyl (C6H5) radicals are long-
lived in combustion processes because they are resonantly more
stable than other radical isomers, which cause these radicals to
play a dominant role in the initial decomposition of BTX. In

high-temperature decomposition of normal alkanes (such as C1—C5),
reactions of alkyl radicals (such as CH3) formed from CH4 decom-
position occur rapidly. But in the case of BTX, it was noted that the
reactions of alkylated-benzyl, benzyl and phenyl radicals from parent
compounds occur slowly [196,212]. Therefore, these reactions could
be rate limiting in the overall decomposition rate of BTX in Claus
reactors. Further decomposition of phenyl radical resulted in C2H2
formation (Ibrahim et al. [207]). Cyclopentadienyl (C5H5) is an im-
portant radical widely observed in BTX oxidation and pyrolysis,
especially in stoichiometric and fuel-rich flames (at equivalence ratio
of 1–2) [215]. The formed C2H2 then undergoes pyrolysis and oxi-
dation through its reactions with the abundant radicals that include
HS, OH, H, S and SO in the reactor to form carbon sulfide. An example
of such reaction is shown in Equations (16) and (17) [215–218]. Since
it is also widely known that C2H2 is a precursor to soot and poly-
cyclic aromatic hydrocarbon formation, other potential pathways
of C2H2 decomposition could be those leading to higher aromatic
hydrocarbons.

The thermal oxidation and pyrolysis of H2S and BTX mixtures,
resulting in ignition delay times and laminar flame speeds, have not
been characterized in the open literature. However, a wide spec-
trum of experimental and numerical work has been conducted on
the oxidation and pyrolysis of BTX, including xylene isomers. Various
models on the kinetics and product speciation of each aromatic
compound – benzene, toluene and xylene isomers – have also been

proposed and validated against different experimental data [219].
Ignition delay and laminar burning velocity are fundamental char-
acteristic parameters of fuel combustion. Ignition delay is important
for describing auto-ignition, understanding the ignition mecha-
nism and analyzing the chemical reaction pathway. Laminar burning
velocity is an important fundamental property of a fuel that affects
its burning rate. The burning rate is an intrinsic property of a com-
bustible mixture [220]. Therefore, both parameters are highly
essential in building, validating and improving kinetic models. More
comprehensive kinetic models need to be developed that can capture
the combustion chemistry of H2S, BTX, NH3 and other hydrocar-
bons. This will require a systematic coupling of the available kinetic
models for neat H2S, hydrocarbon and ammonia fuels, and

subsequent validation under partially oxidizing operating condi-
tions of the Claus furnace. Such a mechanism could significantly
assist in improving the efficiency of sulfur recovery processes and
sulfur quality. Fig. 24 shows photographs of sulfur produced from
a laboratory simulated Claus reactor (by Ibrahim et al. [207]) with
neat H2S and xylene mixtures in trace and high quantities.

1.5.4. Role of COS and CS2 in sulfur recovery

In the Claus process, COS and CS2 are formed or present in the
feed gas, and they have a negative impact on Claus reactor perfor-
mance and efficiency. The formation of COS and CS2 in Claus reactors
often contributes to about 20–50% of the overall pollutant emis-
sions from the process plants [221,222]. These compounds also

decrease catalyst activity due to sulfate formation. Thus, the global
reactions responsible for COS and CS2 formation/destruction in the
Claus process have received some attention. Luistra and D’Haene
[221] used plant data analysis to prove that the concentration profile
of COS increases with increase in temperature. Sames et al. [222]
have also shown that a good relationship exists between the for-
mation of COS and the presence of CO and sulfur. They reported that
up to 71% of COS is formed both in the reaction furnace and waste
heat boiler. The high temperatures in the Claus reactor support the
dissociation of CO2 to CO and O2, and the formed CO reacts with el-
emental sulfur to form COS. Chernysheva et al. [132] examined
mechanistic pathways for the gas-phase oxidation of H2S and CS2.
They developed a CS2 mechanism consisting of 70 elementary re-
actions. Gargurevich [3] reported novel mechanistic pathways for
COS and CS2 formation based on fundamental chemical laws.

Arutyunov et al. [216–218] studied the kinetics of reactions of
SO2 with hydrocarbons. In one of their works [217], they exam-
ined the homogenous gas phase reaction of SO2 with CH4 in a quartz
reactor within a temperature range of 1100–1350 K and pressure
of 53 kPa, and measured the concentration of stable gases using IR
spectra. They also examined the effect of SO2:CH4 ratio in the inlet
gas stream. The results revealed that the rate of SO2 conversion was
dependent on the rate of CH4 pyrolysis. At low ratio of SO2:CH4, the
more favorable products were CO2, H2O and S2, while at higher
SO2:CH4 ratio, the more favorable products were CO, H2O and H2S.
In a similar study, Arutyunov et al. [216] examined the reaction of
C2H2 with SO2 under identical conditions and found that CS2 and
COS are the major sulfur containing species observed. However, for-
mation of COS occurred at a much later stage of reaction and was
attributed to the oxidation of CS2 from the available SO2. Within the
temperature range examined, rate of SO2 reduction by C2H2 was 3–5
times greater than the rate of SO2 reduction by methane. Interest-
ingly, the rate of SO2 reduction by CH4 was proportional to SO2
concentration, while no definite relationship was observed on the
rate of SO2 reduction by C2H2. This provided strong evidence that
the reduction of SO2 occurs through reactions with products of C2H2
pyrolysis.

Karan et al. [223–225] studied the homogenous gas phase
reactions of COS and CS2 formation in a quartz tubular reactor
placed in a furnace. They studied the kinetics of reaction of CO
with S2 to form COS within a temperature range of 873–1423 K
and residence time of 0.5–2 s. They developed a kinetic model
that accounted for both formation and decomposition of COS. It
was observed that the reaction of CO with S2 to form COS is very
rapid at temperatures exceeding 1273 K. These investigators also
reported experimental data on thermal decomposition of COS
over a wide range of COS concentrations (0.20–2.33 mol percent)
and temperatures (1073–1373 K) typically encountered in the
modified Claus process. The experimental results revealed that
COS conversion increases with temperature increase in the reactor
and inlet concentration of COS. Karan and Behie [225] examined
CH4—S2 and CH4—H2S reactions at high temperatures (1073–
1523 K) in a flow reactor within a pressure range of 101–150 kPa
and residence times of 90–1400 ms. The results showed that the
reaction of CH4 with S2 to produce CS2 is kinetically favored, and
this reaction occurs rapidly. On the other hand, reaction of CH4
with H2S also forms CS2, but the rate of CS2 formation is limited by
the H2S thermal decomposition at the initial stage of reaction.
Clark and co-workers [55,57,63,154,226] reported systematic studies
on the mechanism of H2, CO, COS and CS2 decomposition and
formation in the Claus furnace. Some of their results are shown in
Fig. 25.

They conducted experiments using an externally heated tubular
reactor with variable quenching of the hot gases, and reported
that CO2 and sulfur species do not result in CS2 formation, but that
hydrocarbons react with sulfur to produce CS2. Under the partial
oxidation conditions of the furnace, they found that H2S is de-
stroyed much faster than hydrocarbons in the feed gas due to the
lower S—H bond energy compared to C—H. New chemical path-
ways that involve the reaction of CS2 and COS with major species
such as SO2, CO2, and H2 were also examined. They found that
destruction of COS and CS2 by reaction with water vapor occurs
very rapidly, and CO2 does not react with sulfur species to
form CS2.

designed to absorb essentially all of the H2S from the acid gas while
letting most of the remaining gases (generally carbon dioxide, CO2)
to slip through. The enriching process can often raise the H2S con-
centration of the acid feed gas by a factor of 5 or more. This allows
one to use a more reliable sulfur recovery unit process, such as a
straight-through Claus process instead of a direct oxidation Claus
process.

1.6.3. Acid gas bypass

In order to achieve a high reaction furnace temperature, a portion
of the lean acid gas is bypassed around the furnace (see Fig. 28).
This technique is used to process leaner acid gases with 15–50% H2S
content. In this technique, one-third of the acid gas flows into the
combustion burner, and the balance usually bypasses the furnace
entirely. Enough H2S is burned to generate SO2, so that the neces-
sary ratio of 2H2S to SO2 is provided for subsequent reactions in the
catalyst beds. The flame temperature is kept above the minimum,
since the constant amount of heat supplied is absorbed by a lower
mass of gas. The free-flame Claus reaction is reduced or elimi-
nated entirely by this approach, since little or no H2S is available
to react in the furnace. However, this results in a slight reduction
in the overall sulfur recovery.

The amount of oxygen fed to the burner is the total amount re-
quired to burn the entire acid gas stream. The bypassed acid gas
stream is mixed with the burner effluent prior to its introduction
into the waste heat boiler. However, the technique is not recom-
mended when processing acid gas feeds containing BTX. This is
because the presence of BTX in the bypass stream may cause serious
operational problems as well as deactivation of catalysts down-
stream in the catalytic conversion stages.

The technique of acid gas bypass is most effective for ammonia
destruction [228]. The ammonia must be destroyed in the Claus
burner to avoid deposition of ammonium salts in downstream cat-
alyst beds. Several examples of process modifications involving the
burner that can be used to destroy ammonia are Cope, OxyClaus,
and Comprimo [70]. The Cope process achieves an elevated burner
temperature with oxygen-enhanced feed. The burner tempera-
ture is limited to 1750 K and is moderated by a stream of recycle
gas originating as the effluent from the first sulfur condenser. Up
to 100% oxygen may be fed to the special burner, which handles
acid gas, recycle gas, air and oxygen simultaneously. The OxyClaus
process requires no recycle gas, and 80–90% O2 may be fed to the
special burner, or it may operate with air only. The burner may
bypass part of the amine acid gas while burning all of the sour water-
stripped acid gas. This front/side split system is not usually required
for streams containing less than 5% NH3. The Comprimo process is
similar to the OxyClaus in that it requires no recycle gas to mod-
erate burner temperature. The typical burner temperature range is
1500–1560 K, which is lower than the Cope burner temperature.

1.6.4. Feed preheat

This technique involves preheating the acid gas and/or combus-
tion air stream entering the reaction furnace, as shown in Fig. 29,
which are possible using steam heat exchangers. This increases the

Fig. 26. Sulfur recovery process applications (with permission from: Linder group
[227]).

1.6. Techniques for handling contaminants in the Claus process

Reactor temperature and gas residence time are crucial param-
eters in ensuring complete destruction of acid gas impurities in the
thermal stage of the Claus process. Some modifications to Claus
plants have been proposed to mitigate the impact of other impu-
rities (such as NH3, COS, CS2, CH4) in acid gases. The major parameters
used in these techniques are temperature and residence time. The
applicability of these modifications depends on the acid gas com-
position, sulfur recovery capacity and efficiency (see an example
shown in Fig. 26).

1.6.1. Straight-through configuration

In the straight-through configuration of the Claus process, all the
acid gas passes through the combustion burner and reaction furnace
(see Fig. 27). The initial free-flame reaction converts more than half
of the incoming sulfur to elemental sulfur so as to reduce the amount
handled by the catalytic reactors and thus lead to the high overall
sulfur recovery. The reactor temperature attained depends on the
amount of H2S available to the burner. A reactor temperature of ap-
proximately 1480 K is achieved in the case of rich acid gas containing
more than 50% H2S. If the temperature falls below a critical point,
approximately 1250–1350 K, the flame becomes unstable and cannot
be maintained. This point is usually reached during operation with
lean acid gas in which the H2S content is less than 50%. Therefore,
the straight-through configuration is not suitable for processing lean
acid gases.

1.6.2. Acid gas enrichment

This is used to augment the concentration of H2S in waste streams
containing low amounts of H2S. It is sometimes more beneficial
to enrich the acid gas by contacting it with a solvent, which is

reaction furnace temperature, which then promotes BTX destruc-
tion. The amount of steam used for preheating is largely
compensated for by the increased steam production in the waste
heat boiler. Depending on the heating medium, it is possible to
achieve a maximum of 335–375 K increase in reaction furnace tem-
perature. However, combustion air preheating is nominally limited
to 645 K due to metallurgical constraints in the sulfur recovery unit,
and indirect steam preheaters generally will not allow acid gas pre-
heats to temperatures beyond 535 K [70,228].

Selection of preheat type is determined by economic factors, con-
ditions of the feed gas and availability of utilities. Feed preheat can
increase the reaction furnace temperature without significant impact
on the equipment size or sulfur recovery efficiency. However, pre-
heating increases operational costs and the total pressure drop across
the unit, in addition to increasing the capital investment needed
to install the preheaters [228].

1.6.5. Fuel gas supplement

In this technique, the reaction furnace temperature is in-
creased by co-firing a portion of fuel (such as methane) with acid
gas in the reaction furnace (see Fig. 30). The use of fuel gas with
constant composition is important for maintaining the desired com-
bustion condition necessary for optimum Claus reactions. Generally
a temperature increase of about 305 K can be obtained for every
volumetric percent of fuel added [228].

However, it is difficult to implement co-firing, especially when
the acid gas contains BTX. This is also accompanied by undesir-
able side reactions, leading to the formation of COS and CS2. In the
downstream Claus converters and hydrolysis/hydrogenation reac-
tors, considerable amounts of COS and CS2 are converted to H2S, but
are not completely eliminated. The dilution effect caused by the ad-
ditional water formed from hydrocarbon combustion and inert gas

Fig. 30. Schematic representation of fuel gas supplement in Claus process (Ibrahim
[207]).

causes unfavorable Claus reactions, resulting in low Claus process
efficiency. Moreover, this technique requires an increase in the size
of Claus furnace to handle the increased process gas flow, leading
to higher operational costs [70].

1.6.6. Hydrogenation/hydrolysis of effluent byproducts

Aside from the hazardous effects of COS and CS2 to human health
and the environment, these gases negatively affect Claus process per-
formance. For example, the presence of COS and CS2 greatly reduces
the high efficiency of sulfur removal in a Claus process. Both COS
and CS2 can exist naturally in the crude natural gas, or they can be
formed due to the reaction of higher hydrocarbons with other sulfur
compounds, such as SO2 and H2S. In order to minimize emission of
sulfur in the form of COS, CS2, Sn, or SO2 in the effluent gas stream,
hydrogenation and hydrolysis processes are implemented on the
effluent gas of the Claus process. Hydrogenation and hydrolysis of
sulfurous compounds transform the above compounds into hydro-
gen sulfide, which is recycled back to the Claus process (Fig. 31).
This, then, increases the process load requirements or reduces pro-
cessing efficiency for a given plant. The chemical pathways for the
COS and CS2 to H2S are as follows ((18)–(21)):

1.6.7. Oxygen enrichment to combustion air

Oxygen enrichment raises the flame temperature by eliminat-
ing the diluent’s effect on nitrogen in air. An economical source of
oxygen is a key in this technique. A perfect example is the IGCC plant,
where lean acid gas and inexpensive oxygen are both present. When
oxygen enrichment is used, equipment sizes of a sulfur plant are
lower and, therefore, investment costs are also lower. Oxygen en-
richment of combustion air is an effective Claus burner modification
used to increase the Claus reaction furnace temperature. In this tech-
nique, the nitrogen in air is partly or entirely replaced with oxygen,
as shown in Fig. 32. Nitrogen acts as a diluent in the Claus reac-
tion furnace, absorbing some heat released in the combustion
process, which lowers the entire reaction furnace temperature. There-
fore, replacing all or part of the nitrogen present in air helps to
augment the reactor temperature.

Reducing the concentration of nitrogen in the combustion air sig-
nificantly decreases the total amount of process gas flowing through
the unit. This also increases the residence time and provides the
basis for design of more compact equipment, which leads to sig-
nificant savings in capital investment. The high furnace temperature
resulting from oxygen enrichment to combustion air significantly
enhances flame stability and the tolerance of the reaction furnace
to inevitable process disturbances, thus providing a more stable

1.7. Advanced Claus reactor with HiTAC

In the case of lean acid gas feeds (<15 % H2S) special measures
must be taken to maintain a stable flame in the burner and achieve
good combustion efficiency. Sassi and Gupta [58] suggested that
HiTAC or flameless or colorless combustion furnaces can achieve
both of these goals and more. Practically, the Claus process is well
suited for the use of HiTAC technology, as steam generated in the
waste heat boiler as well as the condensers is readily available to
preheat the incoming air stream in a heat exchanger (Fig. 33).

In High Temperature Air Combustion (HiTAC), the injected air
temperature is higher than the auto-ignition temperature of the fuel
and therefore helps achieve uniform ignition and combustion char-
acteristics across the reactor. The auto-ignition temperature of H2S
is 563 K, and that of hydrocarbon fuels is 673–873 K [33]. This favors
preheating with an electrical heater or auxiliary fuel during the tran-
sient start-up period, while self-sustained operation at steady-
state conditions can be maintained afterwards.

The HiTAC technology offers an alternative treatment of lean to
very lean (<15 % H2S) acid gases. HiTAC provides very lean homo-
geneous thermal field uniformity flames that can ensure stable
and compact flame in the Claus reactor, which is not achieved
with conventional Claus furnaces [230,231]. The thermal field
uniformity in the entire combustion can be controlled to tailor
with the acid gas feed stream composition. Controlled tempera-
ture of the Claus reactor is one of the most important parameters
for enhanced sulfur recovery. The temperature variation in the
normal flames can be quite high (more than 773 K) compared to
the HiTAC flame, which can be controlled to better than 298 K in
the entire combustion zone, resulting in significantly higher sulfur
conversion efficiency using a wide variety of acid gases. The
HiTAC produces good overall conversion, low emissions, and uniform
heat loading of the equipment, which reduces mechanical stress.
Studies have shown that sulfur conversions are greater in fur-
naces that are designed for greater gas mixing and turbulence and
equipped with burners that provide for good mixing of the feed
gas and oxidizer and in furnaces of smaller volume [54,232]. A
HiTAC prototype was built and tested at GTI (Mortberg et al.
[233]). The results showed that the super-adiabatic combustion
significantly extends conventional flammability limits to the region
of the ultra-low heat content mixtures (such as lean acid gas) and
features ultra-low emissions for NOx and CO. This super-adiabatic
combustion is very similar to flameless or colorless combustion in
principle, but takes place in a non-catalytic porous medium [58].

operation and improving sulfur recovery efficiency [229]. However,
an economical source of oxygen needs to be available; otherwise
oxygen enrichment technology could be prohibitively expensive.
Recent advances in oxygen separation technologies offer good po-
tential for future deployment of this technology.

Different levels of oxygen enrichment can be used depending on
the desired capacity increase of sulfur recovery. For up to 20%–
25% of the original design sulfur processing capacity, low-level
oxygen enrichment technology is adequate [70]. Low-level oxygen
enrichment (up to 28% O2 enrichment) is accomplished by inject-
ing pure oxygen or oxygen-rich air into the combustion air; that is,
oxygen is premixed with combustion air upstream of the burner.
No equipment modification is required in the existing sulfur re-
covery unit, other than providing a tie-in point for the oxygen
injection line in the combustion air. A sulfur recovery capacity in-
crease of approximately 20–25% is achievable with low levels of
oxygen enrichment. The capital cost investment is mainly in the in-
stallation of the oxygen supply system, which is usually an oxygen
supply line added to the reaction furnace burner. For a desired ca-
pacity increase of up to 75% of the original design sulfur processing
capacity, medium-level oxygen enrichment (28–45% O2) technol-
ogy is required. The combustion air piping in a conventional sulfur
recovery unit is not suitable for handling oxygen-rich air above 28%
oxygen [53]. The burner designed for air-only operation might not
withstand the higher combustion temperature. In any case, direct
injection of oxygen through separate nozzles from combustion air
is recommended; hence, special burners designed for direct oxygen
injection should be installed. For a capacity increase of up to 150%
of the original design capacity, a high level of oxygen enrichment
(>45% O2) is applicable. The thermal section of the existing sulfur
recovery unit must be modified and/or have new equipment added,
depending on which oxygen enrichment technology is chosen.

mixture results in positive enthalpy flux to the cold gas, increas-
ing the reactant temperature prior to combustion.

HiTAC is a proven technology that can reduce pollutant emis-
sions by about 50%, reduce the size of the combustion chamber by
about 25%, and reduce thermal losses to the environment and gain
significant energy savings of about 30% [234]. HiTAC can also be used
with or without oxygen-enriched air or pure oxygen as the oxidant
in place of air. The use of HiTAC can help reduce the formation of
unwanted byproducts (such as COS and CS2) and efficiently destroy
hydrocarbons in the Claus reactor [99]. Moreover, it can also elim-
inate the need for a by-pass feed stream, oxygen enrichment and
contaminant destruction in the Claus process. However, issues of
air/fuel mixing and flame characteristics, such as temperature, size
and flammability limits, which are relevant to Claus process, require
further investigation. The resultant uniform thermal field in the col-
orless (flameless) reactor and gas recycling can produce nearly 100%
conversion. For rich acid gas oxidation, flammability limits and flame
stability are not an issue due to the high calorific value of the gas.
Thermal field uniformity offered by flameless or colorless combus-
tion will always promote better conversion with significantly lower
pollutants emission. Uniform thermal field under defined condi-
tion can help reform H2S to produce hydrogen and pure sulfur
efficiently [99,235].

2. Conclusions

The processes involved in the separation and treatment of acid
gases and other impurities associated with crude oil and gas have
been discussed. Crude oil and natural gas are desulfurized in oil and
gas refineries using hydro-, oxidative, adsorptive and bio-catalytic
desulfurization and amine extraction processes. These processes gen-
erate acid gas waste streams with varying compositions that are
further treated to recover elemental sulfur/and or thermal energy.
Compared to other process types, such as H2S scavengers, liquid
redox, Selectox and biological processes, the Claus process is most
mature technology for the recovery of energy and elemental sulfur.
Most often a combination of acid gas treatment processes is re-
quired to achieve very high conversion efficiency of four nines (nearly
99.99%). However, desired sulfur recovery capacity is the most im-
portant criterion in the selection of most cost effective acid gas
treatment technology. It is recommended to deploy scavengers for
systems when the sulfur recovery capacity desired is less than
0.0023 kg/s. For sulfur recovery capacity greater than 0.24 kg/s,
Selectox and recycled Selectox processes or amine gas sweetening
units in conjunction with catalytic Claus type reactors and tail-gas
systems are recommended. For anything in between, liquid redox
or direct oxidation processes are considered.

The efficiency of the Claus process and the quality of the pro-
duced sulfur can vary significantly depending on the acid gas
composition, reactor design configuration and operational condi-
tions. The roles of different impurities (CO2, CH4, NH3, C3H8 and BTX)
in sulfur recovery chemistry in the thermal stage of Claus reactors
have been discussed. These impurities significantly alter the chem-
ical kinetics of H2S combustion, reducing process efficiency and
performance and increasing operational cost. The formation of sul-
furous compounds (COS and CS2) with different compositions of acid
gas under high Claus reactor condition was also presented, and
reactor conditions that promote destruction of acid gas and
associated impurities, as well as mitigate/promote COS and CS2 pro-
duction with respect to different compositions of acid gas, were
evaluated. Some of the important reaction pathways for acid gas
treatment in Claus reactors were also provided.

However, there is a need for further systematic studies that couple
the detailed chemistry of H2S, BTX, NH3, CO2, CS2 and COS along with
a fluid dynamic model to provide an effective optimization tool for
the thermal stage chemistry in a Claus process, where most of the

elemental sulfur and thermal energy recovery occurs. There are sep-
arate kinetic mechanisms available for BTX and H2S oxidation and
pyrolysis. These kinetic models were developed for neat fuels under
different conditions and applications. Future studies should focus
on systematically combining the mechanisms of neat H2S, BTX and
NH3, so that they can be incorporated into a CFD model to provide
an effective optimization tool. Such a model could be used to explore
a unified reactor condition that provides a reasonable trade-off
between CH4/BTX/NH3 destruction and formation of COS, CS2 and
sulfur, with improved sulfur quality. BTX significantly reduced SO2
in the thermal sage reactor. And given the significance of SO2 chem-
istry in the Claus process, it is important to investigate the kinetics
of BTX oxidation by SO2 under Claus reactor condition. This will result
in a better understanding of the BTX and SO2 chemistry to help in
the development of robust optimization tools for the Claus process
plants.

Alternative utilization and more efficient treatment of acid gas
are also required to protect our environment from sulfur-bearing
fuels while enhancing energy generation. Efforts in these areas have
shown that both syngas and sulfur can be produced from acid gas
under certain reactor operational conditions. This is an attractive
alternative, since the large volume of CO2 in acid gas can be cap-
tured from the produced syngas. Moreover, sulfur recovery from lean
acid gas that contains higher CO2 content than H2S, as well as hy-
drocarbon impurities in a Claus process, poses severe technical and
environmental issues. Therefore, acid gas pyrolysis can be a suit-
able candidate for the treatment of lean acid gas. The H2 and CO
produced (syngas) can then be used in industry for energy and power
applications. These gases can be produced with minimal adverse
effect to the environment, human health and building aesthetics.
Syngas can be used as a fuel for gas engines, or to produce valu-
able chemicals, such as ammonia and liquid fuels.
