The last several decades have witnessed the rapid development of alkaline anion exchange membrane fuel
cells (AAEMFCs) that possess a series of advantages as compared to acid proton exchange membrane fuel
cells, such as the enhanced electrochemical kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction and the use of inexpen-
sive non-platinum electrocatalysts, both of which are rendered by the alkaline medium. As an emerging
power generation technology, the significant progress has been made in developing the alkaline anion
exchange membrane fuel cells in recent years. This review article starts with a general description of the
setup of AAEMFCs running on hydrogen and physical and chemical processes occurring in multi-layered
porous structure. Then, the electrocatalytic materials and mechanisms for both hydrogen oxidation and
oxygen reduction are introduced, including metal-based, metal oxide-based, and non-metal based electro-
catalysts. In addition, the chemistries of alkaline anion exchange membranes (AAEMs), e.g. polymer back-
bone and function groups, are reviewed. The effects of pre-treatment, carbonate, and radiation on the
performance of AAEMs are concluded as well. The effects of anode and cathode ionomers, structural
designs, and water flooding on the performance of the single-cell are explained, and the durability and
power output of a single-cell are summarized. Afterwards, two innovative system designs that are hybrid
fuel cells and regenerative fuel cells are presented and mathematical modeling on mass transport phe-
nomenon in AAEMFCs are highlighted. Finally, the challenges and perspectives for the future development
of the AAEMFCs are discussed.

1. Introduction

PWe have to adopt new energy supply technologies that utilize
renewable energy sources [1(cid:1)8], due to the current energy and envi-
ronmental issues we are facing today. Among them, fuel cells have
been considered as one of the most promising clean and efficient
power generation technologies for a sustainable future [9(cid:1)15].
Hence, tremendous efforts have been made on the development of
fuel cells [16(cid:1)22]. Alkaline fuel cells (AFCs) that use potassium
hydroxide (KOH) solution as the liquid electrolyte have shown much
success since the 1960s, particularly working as the energy supply
devices powering the Gemini and Apollo spacecraft, due to the fact
that the electrochemical kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction
(ORR) is much enhanced resulting from the alkaline environment,
allowing the absence of expensive noble metals in preparing the
electrocatalysts and thus reducing the cost of the fuel cell system
[23(cid:1)25]. Despite its compelling merits, however, this fuel cell tech-
nology has not made sufficient progress in market presence yet. One
significant factor preventing widespread commercialization is the
use of the alkaline liquid electrolyte, which may cause two problems
[26]. One is the carbonate, the product of the side reaction between
hydroxide ions in the liquid electrolyte and carbon dioxide in the air,
reducing the concentration of hydroxide ions and potentially block-
ing the pores of the porous electrode via the precipitation of the
metal carbonate [27(cid:1)29]. The other is electrode flooding and drying
problems, which are more likely to arise if the liquid electrolyte is
not well controlled [30,31].

PTo address the issues caused by involving the liquid electrolyte,
ion exchange membrane fuel cells that employ solid electrolyte have
received ever-increasing attention [32(cid:1)36]. The use of solid electro-
lyte membranes in fuel cells can remove the carbonate problem and
avoid the liquid electrolyte management. Hence, extensive efforts
have been devoted to developing alkaline AAEMFCs and remarkable
achievements have been made [37(cid:1)39]. In addition, many other
advantages of the AAEMFCs are summarized as follows: (1) faster
electrochemical kinetics of the ORR in alkaline media [40,41],
(2) absence of noble metal electrocatalysts [42,43], (3) minimized
corrosion problems in the alkaline environment
[44,45], and
(4) cogeneration of electricity and valuable chemicals [46(cid:1)48]. Cur-
rently, compressed hydrogen and liquid alcohol are the most com-
mon fuels used in AAEMFCs. The liquid alcohols, e.g. methanol,
ethanol, formate, and small polyalcohols, are convenient to handle,
store, and transport [49(cid:1)51]. Another advantage is that they are
easy to be acquired from the abundant biomass, suggesting that the
process is carbon-neutral and the sources are sufficient [52].

PBorohydrides with high energy density are also recognized as a suit-
able fuel for AAEMFCs due to the fact that they are easy to handle,
store, and transport as well. In addition, the products in the anode
effluent can be converted back to borohydrides, which is beneficial
for a sustainable future [18]. In consideration of degree of commer-
cialization, this article will focus on the AAEMFCs running on hydro-
gen that is the maturest in commercialization. The objective of this
review is to provide a general description of this type of fuel cell,
introduce electrocatalytic materials for hydrogen oxidation and oxy-
gen reduction reactions, summarize the alkaline anion exchange
membranes (AAEM) and single-cell performance, as well as highlight
the remaining challenges and future directions.

2. General description

PIn principle, the structure of AAEMFCs is just borrowed from pro-
ton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), with the main differ-
ence that the solid membrane is an AAEM instead of a proton
exchange membrane (PEM). In AAEMFCs, the charge carrier is OH¡
transporting through the AAEM from the cathode to the anode,
while H+ works as charge carrier transporting through the PEM from
the anode to the cathode in PEMFCs. Hence, AAEMFCs have been
considered as an alternative to PEMFCs and garnered renewed atten-
tion recently due to the above-mentioned advantages. Currently,
many researchers have put their focus on the synthesis of polymeric
alkaline anion exchange membranes with high ionic conductivity
and excellent chemical stability, as well as novel electrocatalysts
that are favorable and low cost [53(cid:1)63].

PLike other fuel cells, a single AAEMFC consists of three main com-
ponents, i.e. an anode, a cathode, and an AAEM, so-called membrane
electrode assembly (MEA), as shown in Fig. 1. Specifically, the inte-
grated multi-layered porous structure is constituted sequentially by
an anode gas diffusion layer (GDL), an anode catalyst layer (CL), an
AAEM, a cathode CL, and a cathode GDL. The GDLs in the anode and
cathode that are both composed of two layers, a backing layer (BL)
based on carbon paper or carbon cloth and a micro-porous layer
(MPL) that is comprised of carbon powders mixed with hydrophobic
polymer (typically PTFE). The CLs are usually made of electrocata-
lysts mixed with ionomer, resulting in the formation of triple-phase
boundaries (TPBs) for the electrochemical reactions, i.e., hydrogen
oxidation reaction (HOR) and ORR. Particularly, the GDL provides
the support for the corresponding CL, distributes the reactants uni-
formly, and transports electrons to the current collector. Recently, Li
et al. [64] proposed a metal foam-based electrode integrating the
flow field, BL, MPL, and CL into a whole, which facilitates the mass

3. Electrocatalytic materials and mechanisms for hydrogen
oxidation reaction in alkaline media

PPlatinum (Pt) is generally used as the electrocatalysts for hydro-
gen oxidation in AAEMFCs, which negates a prime advantage of
alkaline fuel cells, which is potentially free from Pt-based electroca-
talysts. The anodic reaction in acid media is expressed:

H2 ! 2H

þ þ 2e(cid:1)

ð4Þ

(cid:1) ! 2H2O þ 2e(cid:1)

while, the product of the anodic reaction in alkaline media is water:
H2 þ 2OH

PParticularly, the HOR activity on the platinum group metals
(PGM) decreases with increasing the pH value. Sheng et al. [65]
reported that the electrochemical kinetics of the HOR were at least
two orders of magnitude slower in alkaline media than that in acid
media. Similarly, Durst et al. [66] demonstrated that the exchange
current densities on Pt/C, Pd/C, and Ir/C in acidic media (pH = 0)
were all declined by about two orders of magnitude when the pH
increased to 13. The oxophilicity did not contribute to enhancing the
HOR activity in high pH. They suggested that the pH-dependent HOR
activity was associated with the hydrogen binding energy (HBE). It
was explained by Sheng et al. [67] that HBE is likely the sole descrip-
tor for the HOR/HER activity on Pt in pH-buffered electrolytes. The
results from the rotating disk electrode test and cyclic voltammetry
test showed that the HOR/HER activity decreased and HBE linearly
increased with the increasing pH, respectively. It was proposed that
the adsorbed OH species did not participate in the reaction, but
influenced the HBE, leading to the reduce of HOR/HER activity. How-
ever, Ledezma-Yanez et al. [68] argued that the pH-dependent HBE
change did not account for the HER overpotential on Pt(111). They
observed that both the HER and H-underpotential deposition
(H-UPD) were slower in alkaline media even if the thermodynamic
driving force was the same, implying that hydrogen adsorption was
a kinetically hindered step. Therefore, it was elucidated that at the
potential of H-UPD and HER, the interfacial water network inter-
acted with the strong interfacial electric field in alkaline media,
resulting in the water network more rigid and more difficult to reor-
ganize during the charge transfer through the electrical double layer.
Consequently, the rate of hydrogen adsorption was severely influ-
enced by the energetic barrier derived from the strength of the inter-
facial electric field. To overcome this constrain, many efforts have
been made to develop non-platinum catalysts for HOR with high
activity at a lower cost [69(cid:1)84]. This section will describe some
types of electrocatalyst, including metals and metal oxides.

3.1. Metals

PMany efforts have been made to increase the metal electrocata-
lyst activity aiming at reducing the amount of Pt, even replacing Pt
[53,69,70,74,77,79-81]. Since palladium (Pd) is similar to Pt in elec-
tronic properties, the HOR on the Pd surface may follow the same
mechanism. In addition, Pd/C and Pt/C exhibited comparable HOR
activity examined by the thin-film rotating disk electrode in acid
environment [78]. Hence, many efforts have been conducted to
improve the electrocatalytic activity of Pd [53,69,79-81]. Bakos et al.
[53] studied the synergetic activity of Pd/Ni for the HOR in alkaline
media. Fig. 2 illustrated the surface and size distribution of the
Pd/Ni. It was shown that 17% of a Ni film covered by a Pd layer of
around 1.5 nm thickness exhibited the highest HOR activity than
other Pd coverages. For the Pd coverage lower than 17%, the current
density increased linearly with the coverage, and then reached a pla-
teau upon further increase, which is attributed to the diffusion limit
for the HOR process. Similarly, Alesker et al. [69] used Pd nanopar-
ticles to grow onto Ni nanoparticles as the HOR electrocatalyst,
resulting in a peak power density of 400 mW cm¡2 in an AAEMFC

Pand charge transport and extends the TPBs. The anode and the cath-
ode are separated by an AAEM, preventing the hydrogen crossover
to the cathode, which causes the fuel loss and mixed potential.
Meanwhile, the pathway for conducting hydroxide ions is built up.
The external circuit provides the channel for the electrons to form
the loop.

POn the anode, humidified hydrogen is fed to the anode flow chan-
nel and transported through the anode GDL, finally to the anode CL,
where hydrogen reacts with hydroxide ions to produce water and
electrons. The anodic reaction is:
(cid:1)! 2H2O þ 2e(cid:1)

POn the cathode, humidified oxygen supplied by the cathode flow
channel is transported through the cathode GDL to the cathode CL,
where oxygen is reduced in the presence of water to produce
hydroxide ions:

PThen, the generated hydroxide ions are conducted through the

AAEM for the HOR.

PTherefore, the overall reaction combining the HOR given by

Eq. (1) and the ORR given by Eq. (2) is expressed as follows:
H2 þ 1

E0 1⁄4 1:23V

ð3Þ

PIt should be noted that the theoretical cell voltage cannot be real-
ized due to a series of irreversible losses, such as overpotentials
caused by activation, ohmic, and mass-transport processes. In addi-
tion, it is worthwhile to note that the hydrogen and oxygen gases
need humidification before fed into the fuel cell in order to achieve
better performance. The major reasons can be summarized as fol-
lows: (1) one of the main deficiencies of AAEMs is that the conduc-
tivity of AAEMs is sensitive to relative humidity. Hence, the
humidified gases that are supplied to the channel can humidify the
membrane, enhancing the ionic conductivity and thus reducing the
internal resistance; (2) in consideration of the electrochemical reac-
tion on the cathode, humidified oxygen provides the essential water
molecular that will react with oxygen to form hydroxide ions. In the
following section, the electrocatalytic materials for HOR, including
metal electrocatalysts and metal oxide electrocatalysts, are reviewed
and discussed.

Pfabricated with Pd (1.5 mg cm¡2) as anode electrocatalyst and Ag
(3 mg cm¡2) as cathode electrocatalyst with dry hydrogen fed at a
flow rate of 200 standard-state cubic centimeter per minute (sccm)
and the air fed at a flow rate of 1000 sccm. It was indicated that the
HOR activity was enhanced, which was evidenced by the negative
shift of the HOR onset potential. In addition, it was believed that the
high activity was ascribed to the presence of the OHads on the Ni sur-
face, providing a faster reaction route for the HOR. In addition, the
nickel-based electrocatalysts for the HOR have also been investi-
gated [74(cid:1)76]. Hu et al. [74] studied the feasibility of tungsten
doped nickel (Ni(cid:1)W) as the anode electrocatalyst for AAEMFCs. The
results showed that the equilibrium potential of the HOR on Ni(cid:1)W
was established in 200 s, indicating that the electronic surface of Ni
was tuned and the oxidation tolerance of Ni surface was significantly
enhanced. It was shown that the highest power density reached
40 mW cm¡2 with humidified hydrogen and oxygen both at a flow
rate of 50 sccm at 60°C, when Ni(cid:1)W (17.5 mg cm¡2) and CoPPY/C
(2 mg cm¡2) were employed as anode and cathode electrocatalysts,
respectively. To further improve the HOR activity, Sheng et al. [75]
synthesized noble-metal-free electrocatalyst via electro-depositing
a ternary metallic CoNiMo on a polycrystalline gold (Au) disk elec-
trode. It was shown that the HOR activity of CoNiMo was 20 times
higher than pure Ni in alkaline media, which is attributed to the

Pweakened hydrogen binding energy on CoNiMo. Zhuang et al. [76]
prepared a composite electrocatalyst, nitrogen-doped carbon nano-
tubes supporting nickel nanoparticles (Ni/N-CNT), to replace Pt for
an efficient HOR. Although the N-CNT did not directly contribute the
HOR activity, it could significantly improve the catalytic activity of
Ni nanoparticles, meaning that the mass activity and exchange cur-
rent density of the Ni/N-CNT were increased 33 and 21 times than
that of bare Ni nanoparticles, respectively. It was indicated that the
high HOR activity was ascribed to the synergetic effect of N atom
and Ni. Ohyama et al. [70] synthesized small ruthenium nanopar-
ticles by liquid phase reduction of RuCl3 by NaBH4 under pH control
and characterized the structure of the Ru/C via X-Ray diffraction
(XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), and X-ray absorp-
tion fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy. The results indicated that
the diameter of Ru particles was 3 nm under pH control (pH = 7),
which was much smaller than that without pH control (pH = 2). The
peak power densities of a H2/O2 fuel cell fed with humidified H2 and
O2 both at a flow rate of 500 sccm employing Tokuyama A201 as
AAEM, Pt/C (0.5 mg cm¡2) as cathode electrocatalyst, and 3 nm Ru/C,
3 nm Pt/C, and 11 nm Ru/C as anode electrocatalysts are 250, 185,
and 134 mW cm¡2, respectively. In addition, the cell performance
with using Ru/C was increased with the cycle of fuel cell operation,
primarily because the Ru species was reduced during fuel cell

Poperation, resulting in the highly active sites for hydrogen adsorp-
tion and oxidation. Recently, Alia et al. [77] synthesized copper (Cu)
nanowires (NWs) supported Pt (Pt/CuNWs) with a 100-nm diameter
and a 25(cid:1)40 mm length for HOR in alkaline media. It was indicated
that compared to Pt/C, the area and mass exchange current densities
of Pt/CuNWs were promoted by 3.5 and 1.9 times, respectively.
Therefore, the improved performance was attributed to compressive
strain on Pt and more adsorption of hydroxyl species provided by
inclusion of Cu. In summary, the novel HOR metal electrocatalysts
that exhibit comparable performance with Pt are mainly based on
Pd, Ni, and Ru. Although the great progress has been made recently,
attentions also should be paid to developing other substrate materi-
als that are more cost-effective.

3.2. Metal oxides

PAlthough the metal electrocatalysts are promising, metal oxide
electrocatalysts that are inexpensive as well have been extensively
studied [71-73,82,83]. Lu et al. [71] synthesized Cr-decorated Ni
(CDN) nanoparticles and tested the effect of modulation on the sur-
face reactivity toward oxygen via XRD and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS). It was indicated that CDN can be easily activated
by gaseous hydrogen at room temperature, resulting in the employ-
ment of CDN as anode electrocatalyst. They showed that a peak
power density of 50 mW cm¡2 was achieved when CrOx/Ni
(5 mg cm¡2) and Ag/C (1 mg cm¡2) were used as anode and cathode
electrocatalysts, respectively, as well as a quaternary ammonium
polysulphone membrane with H2 (relative humidity (RH) = 100%) in
the anode and O2 (RH = 100%) in the cathode at 60°C. Lu et al. [72]
also indicated that the CrOx was believed to weaken the binding of
oxygen to the Ni nanoparticles, resulting in the mild deactivation of
Ni via oxidation. Miller et al. [73] demonstrated that Pd nanopar-
ticles deposited by CeO2 showed excellent HOR activity. The single
fuel cell fabricated with Pd/C(cid:1)(cid:1)CeO2 (0.3 mg cm¡2) as anode electro-
catalyst and Ag (3 mg cm¡2) as cathode electrocatalyst yielded a
maximum power density of 500 mW cm¡2, when dry hydrogen was
fed into the anode at a flow rate of 200 sccm and air was fed into the
cathode at a flow rate of 1000 sccm. While pure Pd was employed as
anode electrocatalyst, the peak power density was decreased to
100 mW cm¡2. CeO2, one of the most oxygen deficient compounds,
is known for the rapid saturation with hydroxide ions [82] and spill-
over of hydroxide ions to support metal nanoparticles [83]. It was
demonstrated that the Pd(cid:1)(cid:1)H bonds were weakened and the supply
of the OHad was enhanced, accelerating the overall HOR. Recently,
Miller et al. [84] studied the effect of Pd loadings on the performance
of Pd/C(cid:1)(cid:1)CeO2. The results from the single fuel-cell test showed that
the Pd/C(cid:1)(cid:1)CeO2 with 10 wt% Pd loading yielded the highest power
density of 500 mW cm¡2 with Pd/C(cid:1)(cid:1)CeO2 (0.3 mg cm¡2) as anode
electrocatalyst and Ag (3 mg cm¡2) as cathode electrocatalyst when
dry hydrogen was fed into the anode at a flow rate of 200 sccm and
air was fed into the cathode at a flow rate of 1000 sccm. While 6 wt%
Pd and 20 wt% Pd loadings in the single fuel cell exhibited 390 and
460 mW cm¡2 under the same conditions, respectively. Meanwhile,
the stability of Pd/C(cid:1)(cid:1)CeO2 was superior than Pd/C under harsh
potential cycling.

PIn summary, great progress has been made in the development of
HOR electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity and low cost to
replace Pt in AAEMFCs. Although numerous investigations have
been reported in recent literature, the stability of non-platinum elec-
trocatalysts is still the major limiting factor for the commercial
applications, which is derived from the morphological changes dur-
ing the process of electrocatalyst operation. Therefore, the future
research direction could be focused on enhancing the durability of
the newly synthesized electrocatalysts without sacrificing the HOR
activity.

4. Electrocatalytic materials and mechanisms for oxygen
reduction reaction in alkaline media

PExtensive studies have been conducted on the oxygen reduction
reaction in alkaline media. The electrocatalytic reduction of oxygen
proceeds either two-electron pathway or four-electron pathway
[85]. Fig. 3(a) generally illustrated the ORR process in alkaline media.

Pstep was the formation of weakly adsorbed species via the diffusion
of bulk oxygen. Then the weakly adsorbed species became the
strongly adsorbed species through chemisorption, which were the
key intermediate in the process. As the strongly adsorbed species
were chemisorbed, the reactions associated with them were mainly
irreversible processes (k3, k4, k12, k13,). In the two-electron pathway,
the weakly adsorbed species were the critical intermediate. The dif-
ference of the strongly adsorbed species and the weakly adsorbed
species lied on the ability to desorb directly and go into solution.
Since the weakly adsorbed species were more likely to be physi-
sorbed, adsorption-desorption equilibrium with corresponding spe-
cies in solution was established as shown in k2 and k¡2, k20 and k¡20,
(cid:1)
as well as k25 and k¡25. It was believed that a superoxide ion HO
2;a
could be formed after the oxygen molecule received an electron.
Subsequently, as the weakly bound superoxide ion was unstable in
aqueous solution, thus it could rapidly go through either a chemical
(cid:1)
pathway decomposing into HO
2;a and oxygen or a electrochemical
(cid:1)
pathway receiving an electron and a proton to form HO
2;a. Analo-
(cid:1)
gously, the HO
2;a possessed two reaction routes: one was to be
(cid:1)
chemisorbed producing HO
2;sa, and the other was to diffuse into the
bulk solution. It can be seen from Fig. 3(b) that the formation of per-
¡ and H2O2, is more energetically
oxide intermediate species, HO2
favorable during the ORR due to the lower overpotential. Thus, the
ORR kinetics are dramatically more sluggish in acid media than that
in alkaline one, which can be explained by the stabilization effect of
¡ caused by the negative charge
the peroxide intermediate of HO2
[86]. When the fuel cell is discharging, the cathode potential is
higher than the potential of zero charge, resulting in the positive
¡ rather than the neutral
charge on the electrode Hence, it is HO2
molecule of H2O2 that can be adsorbed on the cathode derived from
the electrostatic attraction and further to be reduced on the active
sites. As the ORR obstruction has been unveiled, a gate of synthesiz-
ing variety of electrodes has been opened. We herein summarize the

Pproperty and performance of the electrocatalysts reported in recent
literatures, including precious metal electrocatalysts, non-precious
metal electrocatalysts, and non-metal electrocatalysts.

4.1. Precious metals

PUndoubtedly, Pt/C is still the most commonly used electrocata-
lyst, which is also the performance criterion of newly developed
materials. However, the high cost and rarity have hindered the utili-
zation of Pt in fuel cells, resulting in numerous research efforts led to
the development of non-Pt noble metal electrocatalysts with high
activity for AAEMFCs [55,87-93]. Fortunately, Ag- and Pd-based elec-
trocatalysts, more abundant noble metals than Pt, have exhibited
promising ORR activity via various modification methods, including
dispersing nanoparticles evenly on functionalized support, estab-
lishing core(cid:1)shell structure, and inserting other elements. Vinodh
et al. [55] synthesized carbon supported silver (Ag/C) with different
metal loadings via wet impregnation method. The schematic repre-
sentation of cathode was illustrated in Fig. 4(a). The characteristics
of the electrocatalysts were investigated by XRD, thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA), UV(cid:1)visible diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS-UV), and
Raman spectroscopy. The results indicated that the Ag particles in a
range of 5(cid:1)11 nm were well distributed and stable at 800°C as well
as the maximum cell voltage and power density of 0.69 V and
109 mW cm¡2 were obtained with 10 wt% metal electrocatalysts,
respectively. The higher ORR activity was attributed to the larger
surface area, enhanced electrical conductivities, and high densities
of surface defects. Maheswari et al. [90] investigated the electro-
chemical kinetics of Pd/C, Pt/C, and Au/C as cathode electrocatalysts
via steady-state performance test and linear sweep voltammetry
(LSV). It was reported that the Pd/C showed higher performance
(55 mW cm¡2) than Pt/C (40 mW cm¡2) and Au/C (1 mW cm¡2) with
both humidified hydrogen and oxygen fed at a rate of 500 sccm,

Presulting from the Pd surface exhibiting the optimum balance
between the kinetics of O = O bond breaking and electrocatalytic
reduction of the oxygenated intermediates or O(cid:1)(cid:1)H formation. How-
ever, the carbon support will face two main challenges that interfere
the performance of electrocatalysts. One is that carbon support may
suffer from drastic corrosion and oxidation during fuel cell opera-
tion. The other is that the completion of four-electron ORR may be
hindered due to the fact that the two-electron outer-sphere electron
transfer is promoted. Hence, Zhang et al. [92] proposed that the gra-
phene oxide (GO) had the potential to serve as support material due
to the abundant oxygen containing functional groups that offer large
surface area. Alloyed Pd(cid:1)Au nanochains networks were uniformly
anchored on reduced graphene oxide (Pd(cid:1)Au NNs/RGO) via a one-
pot wet-chemical co-reduction method with the assistance of caf-
feine. The results from cyclic voltammetry (CV) demonstrated that
the Pd(cid:1)Au NNs/RGO exhibited much more positive onset potential
and half-wave potential than those achieved by using Pd black and
Pd/C, indicating that the ORR activity was significantly improved.
Meanwhile, it was shown from the ORR polarization curves that no
obvious degradation occurred after the Pd(cid:1)Au NNs/RGO modified
electrode underwent 1000 times tests. It is worthy to note that there
are various support materials for nanoparticles, including Ti, Ni
foam, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), carbon nitride, and carbon nanofib-
ers. Similarly, bimetallic core(cid:1)shell nanostructures possess the
enhanced ORR activity, primarily due to the rough and porous surfa-
ces. Recently, Fu et al. [93] synthesized Au@Pd core-shell nanothorns
(CSNTs) via a facile co-chemical reduction method with poly(allyl-
amine hydrochloride) (PAH) and ethylene glycol (EG) as agents at
room temperature. The results from CV showed that the Au@Pd
CSNTs had a positive shift of 34 mV and 30 mV of onset and half-
wave potentials, respectively, compared with Pd black, demonstrat-
ing that the ORR activity was more competitive. It was concluded
that the improved ORR activity could be attributed to: (1) the high
electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) resulted in sufficient
active sites, (2) the electron and oxygen transport was facilitated by
the unique porous construction, (3) the coverage of the active sites
by the hydroxyl and superhydroxyl groups was suppressed due to
the core(cid:1)shell structure. Inserting other elements into noble metal
electrocatalysts is another way to improve the ORR performance of
the alloy electrocatalysts. Generally, the 3d transition metals have
been widely used as the alloying elements to promote the activity
and stability of the electrocatalysts. Maheswari et al. [91] synthe-
sized PdCo electrocatalysts in varying atomic ratios of Pd to Co,
namely 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1, and investigated the structure, dispersion,
electrochemical characterization and surface area of PdCo/C via XRD,
TEM, and CV, respectively. It was confirmed that the alloy formation
and lattice contraction existed between Pd and Co. The TEM images
indicated that the nanoparticles were crystallized and uniformly
dispersed on carbon. It was also shown that when Co content in
the alloy increased, the mean particle size decreased due to the
increased average Pd(cid:1)Pd bond distance. The results from the single
fuel cell test indicated that Pd/Co (3:1) possessed higher perfor-
mance (85 mW cm¡2) with both humidified H2 and O2 fed at rates of
500 sccm at atmospheric pressure than PdCo (2:1)/C (75 mW cm¡2),
PdCo (1:1)/C (26 mW cm¡2) as well as Pd/C (56 mW cm¡2), which
was attributed to the higher ORR activity and selectivity of PdCo
(3:1)/C than PdCo (2:1)/C, PdCo (1:1)/C as well as Pd/C. In summary,
the precious metal electrocatalysts show comparable ORR electroca-
talytic activity with Pt. One of the future directions is to enhance the
durability of the existing electrocatalysts, while the other is to exca-
vate the potential precious electrocatalysts with high ORR activity.

4.2. Non-precious metals

PThough the precious metal electrocatalysts catalyze the ORR
efficiently, the high cost and insufficient durability shadow their

Pfuture utilization. Hence, further to reduce the cost, tremendous
efforts have been made to develop non-precious metal electrocata-
lysts [94(cid:1)97]. However, the abundant 3d transition metals do not
show ORR activity due to the affinities with oxygen. Fortunately, a
breakthrough has been reported that metal macrocycle compounds
exhibit promising ORR activity, in which the N-metal bond plays an
essential role in the progress [94]. On one hand, the formidable
anchoring effect between the metal and surrounding N elevates the
stability of the compounds. On the other hand, the redox potential
can be relocated by the metal(cid:1)N bond that serves as the bridge for
the p-conjugated ligands on the outer periphery. Recently, Kruu-
senberg et al. [94] synthesized Co and Fe phthalocyanine electroca-
talysts employing multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as
support materials via a simple thermal method. The results from
the rotating disk electrode (RDE) tests showed that the onset
potentials of CoPc/MWCNT and FePc/MWCNT electrocatalysts was
¡0.1 V and ¡0.15 V, respectively, indicating that the CoPc/MWCNT
possessed high ORR electrocatalytic activity than FePc/MWCNT.
The single fuel cell test demonstrated that the peak power densities
were 100, 60, and 120 mW cm¡2 with CoPc, FePc, and Pt
(0.6 mg cm¡2) as cathode electrocatalysts and Pt (0.4 mg cm¡2) as
anode electrocatalyst with humidified H2 fed into the anode at a
rate of 200 sccm and humidified O2 fed into the cathode at a rate of
400 sccm at 45°C. Li et al. [95] synthesized non-precious metal
electrocatalysts (denoted as CoFeN/C(cid:1)(cid:1)H, CoFeN/C(cid:1)(cid:1)HL, and CoFeN/
C(cid:1)(cid:1)HLH) consisting of carbon, nitrogen and transition metal via dif-
ferent post-treatment methods. They investigated the post-treat-
ment methods on the performance of electrocatalysts for ORR in
alkaline media via RDE technique. It was reported that the heat
treatment played a crucial role in generating highly active catalytic
sites. It was also shown that a peak power density of 177 mW cm¡2
and open circuit voltage (OCV) of 0.97 V were obtained when
CoFeN/C(cid:1)(cid:1)HLH (4 mg cm¡2) has been employed as cathode electro-
catalyst and Pt (0.4 mg cm¡2) as anode electrocatalyst with humidi-
fied H2 fed into the anode at a rate of 200 sccm and humidified
O2 fed into the cathode at a rate of 400 sccm at 50°C. While for Pt
electrocatalyst, the peak power density was 196 mW cm¡2 and the
OCV was 1.04 V, showing that the CoFeN/C(cid:1)(cid:1)HLH electrocatalyst
had the possibility to replace expensive Pt. Song et al. [96] prepared
carbon black based Fe(cid:1)Nx/C electrocatalysts for the ORR.
It
was demonstrated that the activity order of different active sites
is Fe(cid:1)N4/2(cid:1)(cid:1)C > Fe4(cid:1)(cid:1)N(cid:1)(cid:1)C > N(cid:1)(cid:1)C >> Fe4(cid:1)(cid:1)C (cid:3) C and the one
with Fe 10 wt% and N 1.57 wt% exhibited the best performance
(107 mW cm¡2).
In addition, the Fe(cid:1)N/C electrocatalysts could
be synthesized by direct pyrolysis of precursors, which was cost-
efficient and batch manufacturing, giving the possibility of Fe(cid:1)N/C
electrocatalysts for large-scale commercial applications. He et al.
[97] synthesized a new nanocomposite electrocatalyst containing
high loading cobalt oxide (24.7 wt%, Co) via incorporating CoO onto
nitrogen-doped reduced GO as shown in Fig. 4(b). They reported
that a synergistic effect between rGO and CoO, resulting from the
unique rGO(N)(cid:1)Co(II)(cid:1)O(cid:1)(cid:1)Co(II)(cid:1)rGO(N) structure, might facilitate
the ORR in alkaline media and enhance the four-electron selectivity
as well. Furthermore, abundant defects and nitrogen doping
resulted in the accommodation of graphene-based supports for a
high Co loading. The fuel cell test results showed that the perfor-
mance of the CoO/rGO(N) did not exhibit significant difference with
Pt up to 400 mA cm¡2. While the power density of the CoO/rGO(N)
(248 mW cm¡2 vs
experienced a large drop compared to Pt
387 mW cm¡2), which was ascribed to the relatively low electron
conductivity. In conclusion, compared to precious electrocatalysts,
the use of non-precious metal electrocatalysts has further reduced
the cost. However, the electrocatalysts suffer severe corrosion and
degradation during the fuel cell operation, especially at high cur-
rent densities. Hence, the stability of the electrocatalysts in harsh
environment needs to be enhanced.

4.3. Metal oxides

PIn recent years, great attention has been paid into a different
class of metal oxides electrocatalysts so-called perovskite electroca-
talysts for ORR, which are considered as alternatives to precious
metal electrocatalysts due to the ORR activity and low cost
[98(cid:1)106]. Generally, the perovskite electrocatalysts can be denoted
as
A1¡x¡yA’
yO3, in which A always represents rare-earth
elements (La, Pr, and Gd) or alkaline earth metal elements (Sr and
Ba) and B always refers to transition-metal elements (Mn, Co, Ni,
and Fe). Suntivich et al. [98] indicated that the ORR activity of perov-
skite electrocatatlysts was primarily related to s*-orbital (eg) occu-
pation and the extent of B-site transition-metal-oxygen covalency,
which could serve as the design principle for synthesizing perovskite
electrocatalysts with promising ORR activity. The principle could be
claimed that the perovskite electrocatalysts that possessed an eg-fill-
ing (s*-orbital occupation) close to 1 exhibited the highest ORR
activity. Moreover, enhancing the covalency between the metal 3d
and oxygen 2p orbitals also contributed to improving the ORR activ-
ity. In a recent publication by Sunarso et al. [99], the ORR activity of
La-based perovskite electrocatalysts was investigated via a thin-film
rotating ring-disk electrode test. Fig. 4(c) showed the results that
LaCrO3 performed largest ORR current density and most positive
onset potential among the LaMO3 (M = Ni, Co, Fe, Mn, and Cr). Nota-
bly, when half of the Ni in LaNiO3 was substituted with Co, Fe, Mn,
and Cr, a more positive shift of onset potential was observed for all
the newly obtained electrocatalysts, which could be explained by
the valence state change of transition-metal cation. The Kouteck-
y(cid:1)Levich analysis implied that the ORR proceeded for-electron path-
way on all the perovskite electrocatalysts, which was consistent
with that little hydroperoxide ion was detected during the negative
scan from 0.5 V to ¡0.75 V. Jin et al. [100] prepared an urchin-like
La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM) perovskite oxide as electrocatalyst for both
ORR and OER via a co-precipitation method with urea as a precipita-
tor. The results from the SEM and BET analysis showed that the mor-
phology was spherical particles with thorns radially distributed on
the surface and the specific surface area was 48 m2 g¡1. It was indi-
cated that the four-electron pathway was dominant during ORR and
a maximum cathodic current density was 5.2 mA cm¡2 at ¡1.0 V vs.
Ag/AgCl with 2500 rpm. Stoerzinger et al. [101] found that the
(001)-oriented LaMnO3-based (LMO) perovskite films have intrinsic
ORR activities comparable to those of high-surface-area LMO pow-
der catalysts, which was attributed to (001) surface being the activ-
ity dominant facet. When the thickness of LMO film grown on
Nb-doped SrTiO3 (NSTO) reduced, the ORR activity decreased. This
phenomenon was explained by the barrier rooted in interfacial band
bending that hindered electron transfer at the electrode-electrolyte
junction and the increased eg orbital occupancy due to the charge
transfer from the NSTO to LMO. Recently, Risch et al. [102] utilized
pulsed laser deposition to synthesize well-defined surfaces consist-
ing of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3¡d (BSCF) on thin film La0.8Sr0.2MnO3¡d
(LSMO) grown on (001)-oriented NSTO as a bifunctional electrocata-
lyst. The combined overpotentials from both OER and ORR kinetics
on BSCF|LSMO|NSTO could be as low as 0.7 V, which rivaled the
intrinsic activities of state-of-the-art catalysts in the literature. Addi-
tionally, the surface stability of the LSMO|NSTO was promoted by the
decoration of BSCF. A hybrid electrocatalyst composed of NiCoMnO4
nanoparticles that were anchored on N-doped graphene nanosheets
with high efficiency and low cost was proposed [103]. It was demon-
strated that the NiCoMnO4/N-rGO exhibited excellent ORR activity
(Eonset = 1.5 V vs. RHE and high current density of 14 mA cm¡2) and
catalyzed ORR mostly through four-electron process.

PIn summary, the unique perovskite structure provides a great
flexibility to design and synthesize a large amount of electrocatalysts
with controlled electronic and geometric structures for efficient

relative to the Fermi

level, high covalency of

PORR. It is believed that a near unity eg orbital occupancy in transition
metal cation, closer transition metal D-band and oxygen p-band
the
center
metal(cid:1)oxygen bond, and oxygen deficiency are favorable for the
ORR activity of the perovskites. Future research direction can
be elucidating the active sites and the relevant ORR mechanism
that are essential to provide valid guidance to tune the structures
of perovskite allowing enhanced O2 adsorption and subsequent dis-
association. In addition, the other research focus can be integrating
perovskite
to
significantly improve mass activity by increasing the active surface
areas and enhance charge/mass transport due to its low electrical
conductivity [104].

electrocatalysts with ORR-active nanocarbons

4.4. Non-metals

PA non-metal electrocatalyst, also called metal-free electrocata-
lyst, does not include any metal element. To further reduce the cost
and increase the ORR activity, considerable progress has been made
in the synthesis of metal-free electrocatalysts. Recently, it has been
reported that the carbon doped with nitrogen shows good ORR
activity [107(cid:1)113]. Higgins et al. [107] synthesized three types of
nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs), denoted as ethylenedi-
amine (ED-CNTs), 1,3 diaminopropane (DAP-CNTs), and 1,4 diamino-
butane (DAB-CNTs), via a simplistic single injection chemical vapor
deposition (CVD) setup. Then thin and free standing films, fabricated
with the N-CNTs, were tested as the ORR electrocatalyst in a single
fuel cell with hydrogen and oxygen both fed at a rate of 300 sccm. It
was indicated that the ED-CNT film displayed the significantly
higher performance in alkaline media than commercial carbon sup-
ported platinum (25.5 mW cm¡2 vs 19.1 mW cm¡2), which was
ascribed to the high extent of nitrogen doping, resulting in the dis-
tinct structural properties of N-CNTs and enhanced electronic prop-
erties. Similarly, Rao et al. [108] prepared nitrogen doped aligned
carbon nanotubes via an alumina template technique.
It was
depicted from microscopic images that the nanotubes exhibited an
outer diameter of 100 nm and length of 60 mm. The OCV of the
AAEMFC employing the N-CNT (5 mg cm¡2) as the cathode electro-
catalyst was »0.87 V, which was comparable to that achieved by
using the commercial Pt/C (0.5 mg cm¡2) as the cathode electrocata-
In addition, a peak power density of 37.3 mW cm¡2 was
lyst.
achieved with the humidified H2 (95% RH, flow rate = 500 sccm) as
fuel at the anode and humidified O2 (95% RH, flow rate = 1000 sccm)
as oxidant at the cathode. Though the performance was a little infe-
rior in comparison to that of the AAEMFC fabricated with Pt/C elec-
trocatalyst (61.7 mW cm¡2), it exhibited potential to replace the
precious metal electrocatalysts. Ding et al. [109] proposed a novel
method to synthesize pyridinic- and pyrrolic-doped graphene for
the ORR with the aid of layered montmorillonite (MMT). A high yield
of planar N that was catalytically active toward the ORR was
observed, as shown in Fig. 4(d). The fuel cell fabricated with
the NG@MMT (4 mg cm¡2) as cathode electrocatalyst and Pt
(0.3 mg cm¡2) as anode electrocatalyst showed a peak power density
of 320 mW cm¡2 with hydrogen and oxygen supplied to the anode
and the cathode at flow rates of 150 and 200 sccm, respectively.
Notably, the performance, which was comparable to that of single
fuel cell employing commercial Pt as anode electrocatalyst
(451 mW cm¡2), could be further enhanced by reinforcing the oxy-
gen transport. Lu et al. [113] synthesized nitrogen-doped reduced
graphene oxide (N-RGO) via facial treatment of grapheme employ-
ing urea as agents at different temperatures. It could be seen from
CV results that the N-RGO based electrode showed a specific
cathodic peak at ¡0.4 V in the presence of oxygen, indicating that
the N-RGO electrocatalyst possessed the excellent ORR activity. In
addition, it was demonstrated that the peak potential of the N-RGO
was more positive than the bare RGO, which means that the doped

Pnitrogen plays an important role in enhancing the ORR activity. Nev-
ertheless, the reduction current reached the maximum value when
the mass ratio of urea and GRO was increased to 1:10.

PIn summary, the most attractive advantage of AAEMFCs is the
absence of noble metal electrocatalysts on the cathode, thereby
reducing the cost. Though it has not been practically realized, tre-
mendous efforts have been made to develop substitute electrocata-
lysts, including non-precious metal electrocatalysts, and non-metal
electrocatalysts for the ORR in alkaline media. The fuel cell, fabri-
cated with Pt-based anode and NG@MMT based cathode, results in
the highest power density (320 mW cm¡2). The future research
direction is suggested to study the mechanisms of catalysis and the
structure of electrocatalysts and then to synthesize non-PGM cata-
lysts with the high ORR activity.

5. Alkaline anion exchange membranes (AAEMs): chemistries
and performance

PAnion exchange membrane is typically composed of a polymer
backbone onto which fixed cationic sites are tethered. It is the cat-
ionic groups that contribute to the mobility of hydroxide ions from
cathode to anode through membrane. Recently, great attention has
been paid to the development of solid polymer electrolytes served
as a thin membrane of a few tens of micrometers in thickness, which
alleviates the carbonate problem caused by the use of alkaline aque-
ous electrolyte [26]. However, the carbonate problem still cannot be
completely eliminated, as the AAEMFCs are still sensitive to the CO2
atmosphere. Additionally, the AAEMs are also facing two more chal-
lenging issues. One is to further promote the ionic conductivity,
resulting in a better performance. Since the diffusion coefficient of
OH¡ is much lower than H+, a higher ion exchange capacity (IEC) is
needed so that a similar conductivity could be achieved. Neverthe-
less, higher IEC leads to the sacrifice of mechanical properties due to
the excessive polymer swelling. The other is to continue to improve
the stability of the AAEMs in the harsh environment and at elevated
temperatures. The polymer backbones and functional groups related
to the conductivity, mechanical and chemical stability can be easily
attacked by the OH¡ and radicals [30]. Hence, tremendous research
has been conducted on improving the conductivity as well as
enhancing the thermal and chemical stability of AAEMs [114(cid:1)118].

5.1. Polymer backbone

P5.1.1. Poly(vinyl alcohol)

PPoly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is a polyhydroxy polymer, which is
very common in practical applications because of its easy prepara-
tion and biodegradability. Moreover, PVA shows a good chemical
stability and hydrophilicity due to the hydroxyl groups. Qiao et al.

Pand his group synthesized three types of polymer electrolyte mem-
branes using PVA as matrix crosslinked with potassium hydroxide,
poly(acrylamide-co-diallyldimethylammonium chloride), and poly
(diallyldimethylammonium chloride), denoted as PVA-KOH [58],
PVA(cid:1)PAADDA(cid:1)GA [119] and PVA/PDDA-OH¡ [120,121], respec-
tively. Analogously, all the prepared membranes exhibited excellent
chemical and thermal stability, as well as good ionic conductivity. It
was indicated that the hydroxide-ion conductivities of these mem-
branes were substantially boosted from 2.75 £ 10¡4 S cm¡1 to
0.02 S cm¡1 at room temperature. Zhang et al. [115] investigated the
effect of molecular weight on the performance of the membranes,
which were developed employing PVA as polymer matrix and poly
(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) as anion charge car-
riers. They claimed that PVA/PDDA-HMw membrane possessed the
maximum OH¡ conductivity of 0.027 S cm¡1, the best mechanical
property, highest tensile strength of 15.3 MPa and tensile elongation
of 16.8%, and excellent thermal stability, high onset degradation
temperature above 170°C, which was ascribed to the most compact
and dense network structure. Peak power densities of 35.1, 28.5,
23.4, and 18.2 mW cm¡2 were obtained in a H2/O2 fuel cell fabricated
with Pt (0.5 mg cm¡2) both at anode and cathode with humidified
hydrogen fed at a rate of 100 sccm and humidified oxygen fed at a
rate of 70 sccm at room temperature employing PVA/PDDA-HMw,
PVA/PDDA-MMw, PVA/PDDA-LMw, and PVA/PDDA-ULMw, respec-
tively. Merle et al. [114] fabricated AAEMs based on PVA crosslinked
with poly(ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ether (PEGDGE) for alkaline
fuel cells via simply blending the cheap materials. It was shown that
the membranes exhibited high long-term ionic conductivity and
high chemical stability, as shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b). In addtion, a
maximum power density of 72 mW cm¡2 was achieved in an alka-
line fuel cell fabricated with Pt (4 mg cm¡2) both at anode and cath-
ode employing PVA membrane with 15 wt% acrylic acid, which was
the only candidate for the application due to the denser structure
with hydrogen (RH = 100%) supplied at a flow rate of 40 sccm and
oxygen supplied at a flow rate of 80 sccm. Lu et al. [122] synthesized
PVA-poly(vinylbenzyl chloride) (PVBC) membrane with a macromo-
lecular crosslinker, in which PVBC acted as conducting polymers and
PVAc containing dimethylamino groups worked as crosslinker and
the supporting matrix simultaneously. The results from Fourier
transform infrared (FT-IR) and XPS showed that the PVBC and PVAc
were crosslinked successfully. In addition, it was indicated that
hydroxide-ion conductivity was larger than 0.01 S cm¡1 at room
temperature and swelling ratio (SR) was suppressed when the tem-
perature was elevated. A peak power density of 124.7 mW cm¡2 was
obtained in an AAEMFC fabricated with Pt (0.4 mg cm¡2) both at
anode and cathode employing the crosslinked membrane with
hydrogen (RH = 100%) supplied at a flow rate of 40 sccm and oxygen
supplied at a flow rate of 70 sccm at 40°C.

P5.1.2. Poly(arylene ether)s

PPoly(arylene ether)s possesses excellent stability and water resis-
tance that are preferable properties of AAEMs. Thus, some AAEMs
based on poly(arylene ether)s have been reported [116,117,123].
Tanaka et al. [123] synthesized aromatic multiblock copolymer
membrane, poly(arylene ether)s containing quaternized ammonio-
substituted fluorene groups, via block copolycondensation of fluo-
rene-containing hydrophilic oligomers and linear hydrophobic
oligomers, chloromethylation, quaternization, and ion-exchange
reactions. It was reported that this membrane exhibited consider-
ably high hydroxide-ion conductivities, reaching 144 mS cm¡1 at
80°C, and retained the high conductivity for 5000 h. They claimed
that introducing highly ionized hydrophilic blocks into multi-block
structure was an efficient way to promote the ionic conductivity.
Jasti et al. [116] proposed a facial synthesis of aminated multiblock
poly(arylene ether)s with hydrophilic blocks via nucleophilic substi-
tution poly condensation followed by quaternization and alkaliza-
tion reactions. It was shown that hydrophilic/hydrophobic phase
separation due to the interconnected ion transport pathway, result-
ing in a high ionic conductivity of 150 mS cm¡1 at 80°C. In the pres-
ence of two vicinal quaternary ammonium groups, the membrane
exhibited promising alkaline stability, because nucleophilic attack
was hindered, as well as the degradation was avoided. Li et al. [117]
prepared functionalized quaternary ammonium poly(arylene ether)
s (QBMPAEs) containing tetramethyl triphenyl methane moieties via
polycondensation, benzylic bromination, quaternization, and alkali-
zation. It was demonstrated that the IECs could be adjusted from
0.90 to 1.73 mmol g¡1 by controlling the conditions of the bromina-
tion reaction. In addition, the water uptake (WU) and SRs of the
QBMPAEs membranes were moderate and could be adjusted by con-
trolling their degree of bromination (DBM) values. One of the syn-
thesized membranes, QBMPAE-d membrane, possessed excellent
long-term alkaline stability for 30 days. It was indicated that the
QBMPAE-d membrane resulted in the highest conductivity of
46.6 mS cm¡1 at 80°C and a peak power density of 20.1 mW cm¡2
was achieved in a H2/air single fuel cell with hydrogen (RH = 100%)
supplied at a flow rate of 300 sccm and air supplied at a flow rate of
800 sccm along with 0.1 mg cm¡2 Pt on the anode and 0.2 mg cm¡2
Pt on the cathode at 70°C.

P5.1.3. Poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenyleneoxide)

PPoly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenyleneoxide) (PPO) has outstanding
physical properties, including high dimensional stability, excellent
mechanical properties, high thermal stability, low moisture uptake,
low flammability, and exceptional electrical properties, including a
low dielectric constant and a low dielectric dissipation factor. More-
over, another superiority of PPO is the safety. The toxicity of many
other materials has restricted their development for AAEMFC appli-
cations. In view of these characteristics, PPO has been regarded as an
excellent candidate for high-frequency substrates. Ong et al. [124]
synthesized PPO based membranes via bromination/amination serial
reactions, which reduced the number of involved toxic chemicals
and reaction time. Though the synthesis route was relatively simple,
the obtained membrane, prepared from 5 wt% PPO, bromine/PPO
molar ratio at 10, nitrogen-free atmosphere, with hydroxylation
treatment and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) as the membrane
casting solvent, possessed competitive ionic conductivity of
1.64 £ 10¡2 S cm¡1 at 60°C. The peak power density increased from
3 mW cm¡2 to 19.5 mW cm¡2 with the temperature going up from
25°C to 70°C with hydrogen (RH = 100%) supplied at a flow rate of
5 sccm and oxygen supplied at a flow rate of 10 sccm along with Pt
(0.65 mg cm¡2) both at anode and cathode. Further increasing the
temperature, a dramatic degradation occurred primarily due to the
thermal degradation of AAEM. Lin et al. prepared PPO based AAEMs
containing pendant guanidinium groups [125], benzimidazolium
(BIm) groups [126], and 1,2-dimethylimidazolium (DIm) functional

Pgroups [127], denoted as GPPO, BImPPO, and DImPPO, respectively.
It was indicated that the GPPO membrane possessed high anion con-
ductivities resulting from the high basicity of guanidinium groups,
and short-term thermal and long-term alkali stabilities due to the p
electron conjugated system. Meanwhile, a peak power density of
16 mW cm¡2 was achieved at 50°C when the GPPO membrane was
fabricated into a H2/O2 fuel cell utilizing Pt (0.4 mg cm¡2) both at
anode and cathode with both humidified hydrogen and oxygen fed
at rates of 600 sccm. In comparison with the analogous PPO mem-
branes containing the classical pendant quaternary ammonium and
imidazolium cations, the BImPPO membrane showed advantages in
ionic conductivity, dimensional, thermal, and mechanical stabilities.
Furthermore, the peak power density was 13 mW cm¡2 at 35°C in
the case of the utilization of optimal BIm-PPO-0.54 AAEM. In addi-
tion, the DImPPO membrane also exhibited comparative conductiv-
ity, in the ranges of 10(cid:1)40 mS cm¡1 and 18(cid:1)75 mS cm¡1 at 30°C
and 60°C, respectively. Nevertheless, the power density employing
DImPPO membrane was much higher than that of other PPO mem-
brane, reaching 56 mW cm¡2, whereas it decreased dramatically to
31 mW cm¡2 after three-time repetition of the test, suggesting the
poorer stability. Li et al. [128] synthesized quaternized PPOs materi-
als containing clicked 1,2,3-triazoles for AAEMs via CuI-catalyzed
“click chemistry”.
It was shown that the obtained membranes
possessed higher WU, hydroxide-ion diffusion coefficient and
anion conductivities due to the formation of efficient and continuous
hydrogen-bond networks. A hydroxide-ion conductivity
of
27.8(cid:1)62 mS cm¡1 was achieved at 20°C in water, which was several
times higher than that of a typical PPO-based AAEM (TMA-20). An
improved peak power density of 188.7 mW cm¡2 was obtained in a
H2/O2 fuel cell fabricated with Pt (0.5 mg cm¡2) both at anode and
cathode with hydrogen (RH = 100%) supplied at a flow rate of
200 sccm and oxygen supplied at a flow rate of 200 sccm at 50°C
employing the membrane with alkyne-functionalized quaternary
ammonium (QA). A recent publication by Dang et al. [129] demon-
strated that the position of QA cations in the polymer structure, ring
size, the presence of an additional heteroatom, and ring substitution
pattern played a crucial role in the performance of the PPO based
AAEMs. The results are beneficial for selecting optimal QA groups to
enhance the lifetime and performance of the AAEMs. Wang et al.
[130] proposed a strategy of supramolecular modalities for strength-
ening the mechanical stability of the PPO based AAEMs substantially.
A secondary amide was introduced into the AAEMs to serve as a
hydrogen-bonding crosslinking motif, which was evidenced by the
101% elongation at break, whereas the AAEMs without hydrogen-
bonding crosslinking showed the elongation at break in the range of
10(cid:1)20%.

P5.1.4. Poly(tetrafluoroethylene)

PPoly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) has been widely used in chemi-
cal industry and other related industries due to its unique properties,
which can be conclude as follows: (1) high chemical stability; (2)
excellent thermal stability; (3) minimal water absorption; and
(4) no toxicity. Due to the high thermal and chemical stability, as
well as low WU, PTFE has been introduced to synthesize AAEMs
[61,131-134]. Wang et al. [61] synthesized a thin (30 mm) composite
membrane by impregnating quaternary 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]-
octane polysulfone (QDPSU) solution in PTFE. The results from the
scanning electron microscope (SEM) exhibited that the obtained
membrane possessed a dense and homogenous structure. It was
shown that the composite membrane exhibited better mechanical
strength (a 32 MPa maximum load), lower WU (61 § 3%) and less
swelling degree (17 § 2%) than pristine QDPSU membrane. Further-
more, a considerable peak power density of 146 and 103 mW cm¡2
were achieved with Pt (0.5 mg cm¡2) both at anode and cathode
along with hydrogen (80 sccm, RH = 100%) and oxygen or air
(100 sccm, RH = 100%) as oxidant, respectively. Zhao et al. reported

Pthat the quaternized polyvinyl benzyl chloride (QPVBC) could pro-
vide sufficient ionic exchange group, but it became brittle after cast-
ing membrane [132]. Hence, they prepared quaternary ammonia
polysulfone (QAPS)/PTFE composite membrane by employing
porous PTFE membrane as the substrate and QAPS polymer as the
anionic conductor [133]. It was indicated that the obtained mem-
brane possessed better mechanical strength, lower SR and WU than
the previous QAPS alkaline AAEM. The fuel cell fabricated with the
20 mm thickness membrane and Pt (0.4 mg cm¡2) both at anode and
cathode with hydrogen (RH = 100%) supplied at a flow rate of
100 sccm and oxygen supplied at a flow rate of 200 sccm resulted in
a peak power density of 315 mW cm¡2 at 50°C. Nevertheless, the
QAPS was inclined to leach out gradually during the operation of the
fuel cell, resulting from the poor interaction between the QAPS guest
and the PTFE host. As consequence, Li et al. [134] proposed a new
approach for making ultrathin composite membranes of alkaline
polymer electrolytes (APEs), which could avoid the leach out prob-
lem. They impregnated the APE ionomer TQAPS into a porous
PTFE film, followed by a self-crosslinking process, forming a semi-
interpenetrating network. It was indicated that the obtained mem-
brane (xQAPS@PTFE, 25 mm thick) showed low area resistance
(0.09 V cm2), a low swelling degree (3.1% at 60°C) and high mechan-
ical strength (31 MPa). A peak power density of 550 mW cm¡2 was
achieved in a H2/O2 AAEMFC fabricated with Pt (0.4 mg cm¡2) both
at anode and cathode employing the membrane with both humidi-
fied hydrogen and oxygen fed at rates of 120 sccm at 60°C.

P5.1.5. Polysulfones

PPoly(arylene ether sulfone) exhibits promising mechanical and
thermal stability, as well as hydrolysis resistance. Recently, some
attempts have been made to the synthesis of membranes based on
poly(arylene ether sulfone) [135(cid:1)137]. Zhou et al. [135] prepared
the poly(arylene ether sulfone) based membranes, containing fluo-
renyl groups (QAPSF), functionalized with benzyltrimethylammo-
nium groups via the polycondensation, chloromethylation, and
amination reactions. It was reported that the QAPSF membranes
were stable at pH 11 and showed slow degradation at pH > 14. A
peak power density of 4.1 mW cm¡2 was obtained in an AAEMFC
fabricated with Pt (1 mg cm¡2) both at anode and cathode operating
on H2 (6 sccm, RH = 100%) supplied to anode and O2 (3 sccm,
RH = 100%) and CO2 (6 sccm, RH = 100%) supplied to cathode. Sur-
prisingly, the addition of CO2 resulted in a promotion of power den-
sity, from 2.2 to 3.2 mW cm¡2, because CO2 was involved in the
chemical progress and transported through the AAEM. Yang et al.
[136] synthesized a series of poly(arylene ether sulfone) containing
bulky imidazole groups (PSf-Im-x) based on a novel monomer 2,20-
bis-(2-ethyl-4-methyl-imidazole-1-ylmethyl)-biphenyl-4,40-diol
(EMIPO), followed quaternization by n-bromobutane. The attached
bulky groups around the imidazolium ring reduced the access of
OH¡ to imidazolium, which leaded to the enhancement of alkaline
stability, showing an OH¡ conductivity of 0.014 S cm¡1 at 30°C and
retaining the 80% of the conductivity for 144 h. It was revealed that
some inorganic materials could be added into polymer matrix,
improving the mechanical, thermal and chemical properties. Li et al.
[137] synthesized a series of cross-linked multiblock copoly(arylene
ether sulfone) ionomer (CLQCPAES)/nano-ZrO2 composite AAEMs
via block copolymerization, bromomethylation, ultrasonication
blending, self-crosslinking, quaternization, and alkalization. It was
shown that the CLQCPAES/nano-ZrO2 composite membranes were
complex cross-linking networks of hydrophobic domains/hydro-
philic domains/nano-ZrO2 with a clear zonal distribution of uniform
nano-sized particles in the hydrophilic domains. The WU, mechani-
cal properties, hydroxide conductivity, and alkaline stability were
enhanced significantly by the modification with block-ionomer
structure, cross-link treatment and the introduction of nano-ZrO2
particles. Particularly, the CLQCPAES/7.5% ZrO2 membrane showed

Pan IEC value of 1.23 mmol g¡1, hydroxide-ion conductivity of
55.2 mS cm¡1 at 80°C, and tensile strength of 32.0 MPa, which pos-
sessed almost the best comprehensive properties.

PPolysulfone membrane exhibits prime mechanical, biological,
and chemical stability, and has a wide operating range at tempera-
ture ( > 80 °C), which attracts worldwide attentions. Zhang et al.
[138] prepared a porous polysulfone AAEM filled with (3-acrylami-
dopropyl)trimethylammonium chloride and N,N’ -methylenebisa-
crylamide with a grid-plug microstructure via phase-inversion,
interfacial diffusion, and in-situ polymerization. It was indicated
that the PSU-PATC(1.2) membrane with optimal content of PATC
performed best (55 mW cm¡2) in a single fuel cell fabricated with
Pt (2 mg cm¡2) both at anode and cathode with H2 (800 sccm,
RH = 100%) supplied to anode and O2 (600 sccm, RH = 100%) supplied
to cathode due to the maximum ionic conductivity. He et al. [139]
suggested that one of the obstacles for the application of AAEMs was
the poor ionic conductivity, which was partially attributed to the
poorly-defined morphologies of AAEMs, resulting in the tortuous ion
transport pathways. As a consequence, they proposed a novel strat-
egy, grafting hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) side-chains along a
model benzyltrimethylammonium polysulfone-based AAEM to form
nanoscale (5(cid:1)10 nm diameter) anion transport channels, to enhance
the ionic conductivities of AAEM. It was indicated that the IEC-
normalized hydroxide conductivity increased by 100% from 20.2 to
40.3 mS g cm¡1 mmol¡1 and the power density increased by 50%
from 118 mW cm¡2 to 180 mW cm¡2 in a fuel cell fabricated with Pt
(0.5 mg cm¡2) at anode and Pt (2 mg cm¡2) at cathode with humidi-
fied H2 supplied to anode at a flow rate at 150 sccm and humidified
O2 supplied to cathode at a flow rate at 200 sccm, simultaneously.
Vinodh et al. [140] synthesized a quaternized polysulfone/ZrO2 com-
posite membrane via solution casting method and determined its
characteristic properties via XRD, TGA, and electrochemical imped-
ance spectroscopy (EIS). The results from the tests indicated that the
ZrO2 nano fillers were distributed homogeneously, showing no obvi-
ous agglomeration. In addition, the composite membrane exhibited
long-term thermal and chemical stability. Typically, a peak power
density of 250 mW cm¡2 was obtained in a single H2/O2 fuel cell fab-
ricated with Pt (0.375 mg cm¡2) at anode and Pt (0.125 mg cm¡2) at
cathode at 60°C as the QPSU/10% ZrO2 has been employed.

5.2. Functional groups

P5.2.1. Quaternary ammonium (QA)

PQA groups are more thermally and chemically stable than tertiary
ammonium (TA) and primary ammonium (PA), resulting in the most
common utilization of quaternary ammonium as hydroxide ions
transfer carriers. Varcoe et al. [141] developed a novel alkaline poly-
mer, employing N,N,N’,N’ -tetramethylhexane-1,6-diamine as the
cross-linking agent and poly-(vinylbenzyl chloride) as the polymer
backbone. After the treatment of KOH exchange, the obtained poly-
mer was coated on the electrodes working as the AAEM, which not
only increased the power density of a single fuel cell using Pt
(0.5 mg cm¡2) both at anode and cathode with H2 (2000 sccm,
RH = 100%) fed to anode and O2 (2000 sccm, RH = 100%) fed to cath-
ode from 1.6 to 55 mW cm¡2 at 50°C, but also avoided undesirable
carbonate precipitation. Pan et al. [142] replaced a part of the QA in
QAPS with a TA, and the two substances crosslinked two nearest
neighboring chains generating xTQAPS membrane upon solidifica-
tion. It was found that the self-crosslinked membrane did not show
any obvious degradation of mechanical stability and IEC in pure
water at 90°C for 500 h, which suggested the membrane exhibited
extraordinary both physical and chemical stability, breaking the con-
tradiction between the IEC and dimensional stability. This phenome-
non could be attributed to the stereo-hindrance effect of the two
benzyl groups in proximity suppressing the Hofmann elimination
reaction. Zhou et al. [143] prepared AAEMs with varying amounts of

PQA groups (0.51, 0.70, and 0.90 mmol g¡1) grafted onto a SEBS block
copolymer and investigated the impacts of AAEMs with various IECs
on the performance of H2/O2 fuel cells. The peak power density of
the AAEMFCs utilizing Pt (0.5 mg cm¡2) both at anode and cathode
with H2 (200 sccm, RH = 100%) supplied to anode and O2 (200 sccm,
RH = 100%) supplied to cathode employing these AAEMs with IEC of
0.51, 0.70, and 0.90 mmol g¡1 were 169, 222, and 285 mW cm¡2,
respectively. It was indicated that a higher content of QA groups in
the membranes leaded to higher ionic conductivity, resulting in the
lower overpotential and higher power density. They revealed that
the transportation resistance of the OH¡ ions was a controlling factor
when fewer functional groups were contained in the membrane or
the cell voltage was higher. Li et al. [144] reported highly stable,
anion conductive and comb-shaped copolymers containing long
alkyl side chains pendant to the nitrogen-centered cation via a Men-
shutkin reaction to form comb-shaped structures. It showed that the
membrane with long alkyl chain of up to 16 carbon atoms, which
had the longest hexadecyl chain, exhibited higher hydroxide-ion
conductivity, more distinct ionic domains, and lower WU than that
with a hexyl side chain. The peak power density of fuel cell fabri-
cated with Pt (0.5 mg cm¡2) both at anode and cathode using both
humidified H2 O2 fed at flow rates at 200 sccm with C16D40 mem-
brane was 77 mW cm¡2, which was slightly higher than that using
C6D60 (67 mW cm¡2). Increasing the flow rates of hydrogen and
oxygen, the peak power density of C6D60 could reach 145 mW cm¡2
when the flow rates of anode and cathode were both at 2000 sccm.
However, the C16 membrane was inferior in the film-forming ability
due to the poor compatibility between long alkyl side chain and
polymer backbone. Ren et al. [145] reported highly conductive
AAEM with styrenic diblock copolymer, a quaternary ammonium-
functionalized hydrophilic block and a cross-linkable hydrophobic
block, which possessed high ionic conductivity at 98 mS cm¡1 and
controlled membrane swelling with WU at 117 wt% at 22°C. It was
ascribed to the reduced tortuosity of the ionic conduction pathways.
Moreover, excessive WU was suppressed because the mechanical
integrity of the membrane was maintained due to the hydrophobic
network. A peak power density of 168 mW cm¡2 was obtained in a
H2/air fuel cell fabricated with Pt (1 mg cm¡2) both at anode and
cathode using newly developed AAEM (C30D70-1.7) with H2
(250 sccm, RH = 95%) supplied to anode and air (250 sccm, RH = 95%)
supplied to cathode at 50°C.

P5.2.2. Imidazolium

PThough the QA groups are more thermally and chemically stable
than TA and PA groups, the AAEMs with QA groups are still facing
the facile degradation and excessive swelling problems. Hence, a
resurgence of exploring substituted functional groups has occurred.
Imidazolium salts (IMSs) are well-known as a type of ionic liquid,
which can act as electrolytes due to their high chemical stability and
low vapor pressure. It seems that imidazolium chemistry is more
amenable to AAEM fabrication through post-functionalization,
resulting in the formation of ion clusters for efficient transport of
OH¡. Recently, Lu et al. [146] synthesized imidazolium-functional-
ized AAEMs via functionalization of chloromethylated poly(ether
sulfone) (PES) with 1-alkylimidazole. It was revealed that the WU,
SR and solubility of AAEMs increased but the OH¡ conductivity
decreased with the increment of the alkyl line length on the imida-
zolium group. They claimed that the ionic conductivity was deter-
mined by the ionic concentration, which was affected by IEC and SR.
Accordingly, the quotient of IEC divided by SR (IEC/SR) could be
regarded as an indirect indicator of the ionic concentration. More-
over, a peak power density of »30 mW cm¡2 was obtained in a
H2/O2 AAEMFC fabricated with Pt (0.4 mg cm¡2) both at anode and
cathode employing the fabricated AAEM and anion exchange ionom-
ers (AEIs) with H2 (50 sccm, RH = 100%) supplied to anode and air
(100 sccm, RH = 100%) supplied to cathode at 45°C. Zhang et al. [147]

Preported a polysulfone-imidazolium AAEM (PSf-ImOH) via function-
alization of chloromethylated polysulfone with methylimidazole,
added different degrees of chloromethylation of PSf to control the
membrane properties. They found that the membranes possessed
comparable IEC, conductivity, and thermal stability with the conven-
tional AAEMs. In spite of the low power density (16 mW cm¡2), a
new route for non-QA AAEM design and fabrication was offered.
Ran et al. [148] developed imidazolium-type AAEMs (Im-AAEM)
based on bromomethylated poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenyleneoxide)
(BPPO) polymer chains via solution casting of NMP solutions. Addi-
tionally, a favorable conductivity up to 100 mS cm¡1 was obtained at
80°C, resulting from the nano-scale phase-separated construction by
the solution casting method. It was indicated that different IECs
ranging from 1.1 to 2.4 mmol g¡1 could be obtained by tuning the
molar ratio of 1-methylimidazole to CH2Br groups in the starting
polymer. A peak power density of 30 mW cm¡2 was achieved in a
single fuel cell using Pt (0.5 mg cm¡2) both at anode and cathode
with Im-AAEM with both humidified hydrogen and air fed at flow
rates of 600 sccm at 50°C.

5.3. Other chemistries

the conductivity of

PIn addition to the above-mentioned AAEMs, extensive other
types of AAEMs based on various materials have been synthesized
and reported [149(cid:1)163]. Xing et al. [149] found that the conductiv-
ity of KOH-doped polybenzimidazole (PBI) was remarkable, reaching
to 9 £ 10¡2 S cm¡1 at 25°C, which was much higher than that of pre-
ciously obtained on acid-doped PBI. In addition, the H2/O2 fuel cell
using this polymer electrolyte exhibited the same performance as
those based on Nafion 117 membrane. Li et al. [150] reported that
grafting long side-chain cations onto PBI was an effective way to
improve the OH¡ conductivity, mechanical and thermal stability, as
well as reduce swelling ratio. Wan et al. [151] synthesized different
solid polymer electrolyte membranes using chitosan as matrices
incorporated with potassium hydroxide as ionic carrier. After hydra-
tion for 1 h,
the membrane was about
10 mS cm¡1. When being integrated into the fuel cells, the maxi-
mum current density reached 35 mA cm¡2 and the open circuit volt-
age of 1 V was achieved. Additionally, they also proposed two
approaches to improve the fuel cell performance [152]. One was to
add an alkaline and ionic-conductive interfacial gel, and the other
was to decrease the thickness of the membrane. Luo et al. [153] syn-
thesized a novel high molecular weight copolymer quaternized poly
(methyl methacrylate-co-butyl acrylate-co-vinyl benzylchloride)
(denoted as QPMBV) composed of methyl methacrylate (MMA),
butyl acrylate (BA), and VBC. It was reported that polymer electro-
lytes could be designed bottom-up through mini-emulsion polymer-
ization by selecting desirable monomer [154]. Furthermore, the
conductivity reached 8.2 mS cm¡1 at 80°C. The results from the fuel
cell performance evaluation demonstrated that the peak power den-
sity of 25 mW cm¡2 was achieved in a single fuel cell fabricated with
Pt (0.5 mg cm¡2) both at anode and cathode with H2 (80 sccm,
RH = 80%) supplied to anode and air (80 sccm, RH = 80%) supplied to
cathode at 60°C, suggesting that the preparation concept of these
membranes was feasible [155]. Moreover, the conductivity and the
mechanical strength were balanced by utilizing the designed hydro-
phobic and hydrophilic segments [154]. Hence, they concluded the
membrane properties as follows [156]: (1) higher molecular weight
resulted in the improvement of the mechanical strength as well as
reduction of the WU; (2) higher concentration of the conductive
sites resulted in the enhancement of conductivity but simulta-
neously impairment of the mechanical properties; (3) higher glass
transition temperature resulted in the promotion of the membrane
durability; and (4) the water hydrophilicity of the mechanical sup-
port played an important role in the WU. Wu et al. [157] prepared a
high ion-conduction alkaline membrane by sulfonation with lower

Pcost using non-woven polypropylene/polyethylene (PP/PE). It was
shown that the ionic conductivity was improved from 8.8 to
17.5 mS cm¡1, while the decline of thermal resistance (4%) and
mechanical strength (21%) was reduced. Sollogoub et al. [158] devel-
oped an AAEM using a poly(epichlorhydrin) as matrix and incorpo-
rated two cyclic diamines, namely 1,4-diazabicyclo[2,2,2]-octane
(DABCO) and 1-azabicyclo[2,2,2]-octane (Quinuclidine),
into the
matrix to ensure anionic conduction properties. They illustrated that
the transport number is usually 0.99 and the peak power density
was nearly 100 mW cm¡2 when the membrane was assembled in a
H2/O2 fuel cell utilizing Pt (0.17 mg cm¡2) as both anode and cathode
electrocatalysts. Hibino et al. [159] developed a series of hydroxide-
ion conducting antimony (V)-doped Tin pyrophosphate electrolyte,
Sn1¡xAxP2O7 (A = V, Nb, Ta, and Sb) compounds, for intermediate-
temperature alkaline fuel cells. It was indicated that Sn0.92Sb0.08P2O7
exhibited the highest electrical conductivity in the temperature
range of 50(cid:1)200°C. Additionally, the peak power densities of
76 mW cm¡2, 94 mW cm¡2, 114 mW cm¡2, 130 mW cm¡2,
132 mW cm¡2 and 147 mW cm¡2 were obtained with Pt
(2 mg cm¡2) both at anode and cathode and humidified hydrogen
and air at rates of 50 sccm at 75°C, 100°C, 125°C, 150°C, 175°C, and
200°C, respectively [160]. Zhao et al. [161] reported a series of pore-
filled AAEMs via thermal polymerization of chloromethyl monomer
in a porous PE substrate followed by amination with trimethyl-
amine.
indicated that a hydroxide conductivity of
0.057 S cm¡1 was obtained at 30°C, in deionized water and the syn-
thesized membrane possessed long term alkaline stability. A peak
power density of 370 mW cm¡2 was achieved in a H2/O2 fuel cell uti-
lizing Pt (0.5 mg cm¡2) both at anode and cathode with hydrogen
(100 sccm, RH = 100%)
fed to anode and oxygen (200 sccm,
RH = 100%) fed to cathode at 50°C. Kim et al. [162] fabricated pen-
tamethylguanidinium functionalized perfluorinated hydroxide-ion
conducting ionomers for AAEM. It was shown that the alkaline sta-
bility of the ionomers largely depended on the adjacent group that
connected the cation. Meanwhile, the phenylguanidinium function-
alized ionomer exhibited better stability than sulfone guanidinium
functionalized ionomer due to the charge delocalization of the
formed resonance structure. When the membrane was fabricated
into a H2/O2 fuel cell using Pt (3.4 mg cm¡2) on the anode and Pt
(6.5 mg cm¡2) on the cathode with supplied humidified hydrogen
and oxygen, a peak power density of 577 mW cm¡2 was obtained.
Recently, Chen et al. [163] found that both introducing ionic liquids
and adding nano-TiO2 into the AAEMs contributed to improving the
OH¡ conductivity. The ionic liquids dispersed in the membrane func-
tioned active sites for secondary OH¡ conduction, and the nano-TiO2
particles could significantly alleviate the ionic liquid loss and stabi-
lize the ionic liquid monomer in the membrane.

It was

PThe effects of the cations chemistries, the length of alkyl chain of
the diamines, the reaction conditions of chloromethylation, and the
parameters of polymers on the AAEMs have been extensively inves-
tigated [164(cid:1)169]. Einsla et al. [164] tested the stability of cations
for anion exchange membrane fuel cells and illustrated that the sta-
bility of benzyltrimethylammonium hydroxides was much better
than that of phenyltrimethylammonium hydroxides under similar
conditions. Furthermore, they showed the degradation of stability of
the cation when the concentration of the ammonium hydroxides
was increased. Arges et al. [165] studied the influence of different
cation chemistries, 1,4-dimethylpiperazinium (DMP + ), trimethy-
lammonium (TMA + ), and trimethylphosphonium (TMP + ), on ionic
conductivity and alkaline stability of AAEMs. They concluded from
the obtained experimental evidence as follows: (1) phosphonium
cations with similar or greater basicity degraded more rapidly than
ammonium cations; (2) phosphonium cations degraded through a
fundamentally different mechanism (ylide formation) than ammo-
nium cations (direct nucleophilic substitution); (3) as long as the
issue of significant WU did not come into play, the fuel cell

-tetramethyl-1,3-propandiamine (TMPDA), N,N,N’,N’

Pperformance was enhanced with higher IEC AAEMs. Park et al. [166]
investigated the effect of the length of alkyl chain of the diamines
on ionic conductivity and thermal characteristics via employing
TMA as a monoamine and N,N,N’,N’ -tetramethylmethanediamine
(TMMDA), N,N,N’,N’ -tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA), N,N,N’,
N’
-tetra-
methyl-1,4-butanediamine (TMBDA) and N,N,N’,N’ -tetramethyl-
1,6-hexanediamine (TMHDA) as various diamines. The results
showed that the mixture of TMA and TMHDA had a better hydroxyl
ion conductivity and thermal stability than others, suggesting that a
longer alkyl chain resulted in higher performance. Wang et al. [167]
demonstrated that the parameters, including reaction time, reaction
temperature, concentration of polymer, concentration of chlorome-
thylation agent, and the amount of catalyst, possessed significant
impacts on chloromethylation. When these parameters were well
controlled, the gelation could be avoided. Among the parameters,
the concentration of the chloromethylation agent played a dominant
role in enhancing the attachment of chloromethyl functional group
onto the polymer. Luo et al. [168] investigated the effects of polymer
composition drift, molecular weight, and polymer crosslinking on
the properties of quaternized poly(methylmethacrylate-co-vinyl-
benzyl chloride) (QPMV)-based AAEM. It was indicated that the ini-
tial monomer ratio and the resulted copolymer composition could
influence the hydrophobic/hydrophilic portions in the membrane.
They demonstrated that decreasing initiator potassium persulfate
(KPS) and increasing surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) could
increase the molecular weight, simultaneously improving the
mechanical properties. It was believed that crosslinking method
could alleviate the WU problem due to the less distinct phase sepa-
ration feature. Pan et al. [169] proposed two strategies for develop-
ing advanced APEs which were highly resistant to swelling and
showed conductivities comparable with Nafion: self-crosslinking
and self-aggregating designs. It was indicated that a short-range
cross-linker, tertiary amino groups, was grafted onto the QAPS and
the membrane swelled by less than 3% at 80°C. In self-aggregating
design, long alkyl side-chains were attached to the QAPS, which pro-
duced enlarged and aggregated ionic channels.

5.4. AAEM performance

P5.4.1. Effect of pre-treatment

PBefore being integrated into the fuel cell, the membrane would
be immersed into water or alkaline electrolyte to improve the con-
ductivity. Under pure water operation, the characterization of mem-
brane has been extensively conducted [170,171]. Li et al. [170]
prepared AAEMs with significant ionic conductivities over the order
of 10¡2 S cm¡1 in DI water at room temperature. The fuel cell using
Pt (0.5 mg cm¡2) both at anode and cathode yielded an OCV of
1.028 V and a peak power density of 33 mW cm¡2 with hydrogen
(50 sccm, RH = 100%) supplied on the anode and oxygen (100 sccm,
RH = 100%) supplied on the cathode in the absence of liquid electro-
lyte, such as KOH and NaOH, at 30°C, suggesting the possibility of
the membrane for AAEMFCs application. Mamlouk et al. [171] stud-
ied the effect of anion functional groups on the conductivity and per-
formance of AAEMs. It showed that TMA functionalized membrane
possessed the highest conductivity among amine/sulphide-based
functional groups with conductivities values up to 0.25 and
0.043 S cm¡1 in plane and through plane, respectively. The highest
power density of 478 mW cm¡2 was achieved when TMA functional-
ized electrodes fabricated with Pt (0.4 mg cm¡2) were employed, fol-
lowed by the second highest power density of 236 mW cm¡2
achieved by the TMHDA electrodes. Trimethylamine (TEA) and
DABCO electrodes showed analogous power densities of 100 and
116 mW cm¡2, respectively. Finally, the dimethyl sulfide (DMS)
functionalized electrodes performed the lowest power density of
58 mW cm¡2. As a consequence, it was demonstrated that the

Pionomer functional groups affected the oxygen permeability, the
activation energy and the exchange current density for oxygen
reduction and anode flooding. Thus, the type of functional groups
used for the ionomer can severely restrict cell performance.

PWhen the pure water changes to alkaline electrolyte, the perfor-
mance has also been studied [58,119,121]. Fu et al. [58] demon-
strated that the ionic conductivity of the membrane was promoted
to 0.473 mS cm¡1 after alkali (2(cid:1)4 M) doping due to the KOH pene-
trated into the polymer. However, there was no significant contribu-
tion to the conductivity when the concentration of the KOH was
larger than 4 M, which was attributed to the weak ionic mobility.
Similarly, Zhang et al. [121] found that the conductivity of the AAEM
reached to a maximum value of 0.025 S cm¡1 after the KOH (2 M)
doping. Qiao et al. [119] claimed that this phenomenon could be
explained by the two following reasons: one was that the QA groups
would decompose in such harsh basic environment, and the other
was that the ionic mobility became weak due to the increase of the
viscosity or the formation of ion-pairs. Jiang et al. [172] designed
an air-breathing cell for fast screening of electrolytes as shown in
Fig. 6(a) and (b), which was suitable for using various liquid electro-
lytes, thus reproducible data could be obtained. Subsequently,
the effects of different electrolytes, i.e. 1.0 M tetramethylammonium
hydroxide
1.0 M tetraethylammonium hydroxide
(TEAOH), 1.0 M tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPrAOH), 1.0 M
KOH, and 0.5 M H2SO4, on the performance of fuel cells were investi-
gated. First, the inorganic electrolytes were evaluated at various
temperatures. The results showed that the performance of the fuel
cell utilizing Pt (0.5 mg cm¡2) both at anode and cathode with 1.0 M
KOH increased from 13 to 29 mW cm¡2 with the temperature rising
from 20 to 80°C when hydrogen (250 sccm, RH = 95%) was fed on the
anode and air (250 sccm, RH = 95%) was fed on the cathode. In con-
trast, the fuel cell employing 0.5 M H2SO4 yielded an increasing
power density of 17(cid:1)28 mW cm¡2 with temperature elevating from
20°C to 60°C. Further increasing the temperature to 80°C, there was
no obvious performance promotion occurring, which was probably
attributed to the electrocatalyst passivation in H2SO4 at high tem-
peratures. Second, it could be seen from the performance tests
that the peak power densities of fuel cells employing 0.5 M H2SO4,
1.0 M TMAOH, and 1.0 M KOH as electrolytes were 17, 14, and

(TMAOH),

P13 mW cm¡2 at 20°C, respectively. It was suggested that electrolyte
concentration could change the cell impedance, resulting in the
change of cell performance. Finally, the effects of organic molecular
size on the performance have been studied [172]. It was shown that
the smaller organic molecular size resulted in the higher power den-
sity due to the more active sites on the electrode surface. Moreover,
when the organic alkaline electrolyte was used, the cell performance
decreased significantly caused by CO2 and acid.

P5.4.2. Effect of carbonate

¡, and CO3

PThe absorption of the CO2 on the membrane, denoted as carbon-
ate effect, has negative effects on the performance of the AAEMFCs.
Due to the formation of carbonates within the CL and AAEM,
the conductivity will decrease significantly, resulting in a large per-
formance drop [173,174]. Hence, the carbonate effect has been
extensively studied [175(cid:1)182]. Fukuta et al. [175] found that the
maximum power density of the alkaline fuel cell in the case of pure
air was 290 mW cm¡2, which was as twice as that in the case of
ambient air. It was determined that the OH¡ form membrane could
¡ form, then through the self-
easily absorb CO2, change to HCO3
purging phenomenon, finally return to OH¡ form. Vega et al. studied
2¡ on the AAEMFC operation
the effects of CO2, HCO3
[176(cid:1)179]. They found that a 26% conductivity decrease occurred
when the membrane was exposed to hydroxide ions due to the
nucleophilic attack degradation mechanisms and Hofmann elimina-
tion, while the effect of exposure to carbonate environments was
not significant because the carbonate was weaker nucleophiles.
However, the overall conductivity of the membrane exposed to
hydroxide ions was higher, which was attributed to the carbonate
adsorption on the electrode, reducing the active area. Inaba et al.
[180] and Matsui et al. [181] showed that the membrane resistance
decreased due to the self-purging mechanism at high current densi-
ties, while the cell voltage was reduced significantly. It was demon-
strated that a high anodic overpotential occurred because of the
accumulation of carbonate/bicarbonate ions at the anode, while the
overpotential of the cathode was hardly changed, suggesting that it
was important to suppress the accumulation. Suzuki et al. [182]
investigated the effect of CO2 dissolution into anion exchange mem-
brane on fuel cell performance. They found that the conductivity of
AAEM and potential difference decreased with an increase in car-
bonate ion species. It was indicated that the increment of ohmic
resistance was noticeable by the supply of CO2 to cathode, but not
obvious by the supply of CO2 to anode. They demonstrated that the
formation and exclusion of carbonate ion species and/or carbonic
acid in the vicinity of TPB played the dominant role for the electrode
overpotential.

P5.4.3. Effect of radiation

PRecently, the radiation-grafted AAEMs have attracted worldwide
attention, which is attributed to several advantages [183,184]: (1)
Radiation grafting is one of the most versatile techniques for prepar-
ing membrane materials; (2) No film formation process is required
due to the use of pre-formed polymer films; (3) The degree of mono-
mer grafting is tunable, which can be achieved by optimizing the
grafting parameters; and (4) Simple preparation procedures and
absence of highly reactive chemical initiators and catalysts result in
reduction of cost. Hence, a large amount of radiation-grafted AAEMs
have been synthesized [185(cid:1)191]. Varcoe et al. [185] synthesized
an alkaline AAEM based on ethylene-co-tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE),
which was physically strong, quaternary-ammonium-functional-
ized, and radiation-grafted. The results from H2/O2 fuel cell fabri-
cated with Pt (0.5 mg cm¡2) both at anode and cathode showed that
a peak power density of 130 mW cm¡2 has been achieved with both
humidified hydrogen and oxygen fed at flow rates of 2000 sccm at
60°C. They stated that the performance was substantially limited by
the mass transport in the electrodes. In addition, Poynton et al. [186]

Psynthesized various ETFE AAEMs via e-beam irradiation. Afterwards,
it was found that the conductivities of the thinnest membrane
(17 mm, denoted as S20) reached to 60 mS cm¡1, and the fuel cell
fabricated with S20 membrane and Pt (0.5 mg cm¡2) both at anode
and cathode yielded a peak power density of 230 mWcm¡2 along
with both humidified hydrogen and oxygen at flow rates at
2000 sccm at 50°C. The improvement in the performance was attrib-
uted to the better mass transport. Similarly, Nikolic et al. [187] pre-
pared three different types of modified PVA based membranes,
namely plain PVA, g-PVA cross-linked using gamma irradiation, and
PVA doped with Mo (PVA-Mo). The results from the power output
tests showed that the peak power density of the fuel cell fabricated
with Pt (0.2 mg cm¡2) both at anode and cathode employing modi-
fied g-PVA and PVA-Mo membranes were 6.4 and 6.8 mW cm¡2,
which were better
than that using plain PVA membrane
(5.0 mW cm¡2) due to larger absorption of alkaline solution. Deavin
et al. [188] prepared radiation-grafted alkaline AAEMs containing
pendent groups with either benzyltrimethylammonium (BTM) or
benzylmethylimidazolium (BMI) and made comparison of two
AAEMs. It was indicated that, though the BMI-AAEM possessed com-
parable conductivity to the BTM-benchmark AAEM, the BMI-AAEM
showed severe in-situ degradation due to the intrinsically poor
chemical stability in strong alkaline media. It was demonstrated that
there was no real advantage in using anion-exchange polymer elec-
trolytes containing pendent imidazolium groups in strong alkaline
systems. Fang et al. [189] developed radiation-grafted ETFE-based
membrane via quaternization and crosslinking with DABCO, alkyl-
ation with p-Xylylenedichloride (DCX), and quaternization again
with TMA, of which the ionic conductivity is 3.9 £ 10¡2 S cm¡1 at
20°C in DI water.
the conductivity increases to
7.4 £ 10¡2 S cm¡1 at 80°C. Meanwhile, the conductivity could be
retained for 120 h after being treated in KOH solution at 60°C. An
OCV of 1.034 V and a peak power density of 48 mW cm¡2 were
obtained under 100% relative humidity with H2 and O2 both fed at
rates of 100 mL min¡1. The performance was derived from good leak
tightness of electrodes and enhanced electrochemical reaction kinet-
ics. Recently, Wang et al. [190] utilized 30 kGy absorbed dose, 5 vol%
VBC monomer, and water as diluent to synthesize a ETFE-based radi-
ation-grafted AAEM. When comparing to the prior state-of-the-art
protocol, this new method was closer to a commercially-relevant
roll-to-roll process. The obtained AAEM exhibited a similar IEC of
2.1 mmol g¡1, a higher Cl¡ anion-conductivity of 68 mS cm¡1 vs.
48 mS cm¡1 at 80°C, and a better mechanical stability. Meanwhile,
they employed a non-fluorinated polymer film (low-density poly-
ethylene (LDPE)) as precursor to prepare radiation-drafted AAEM
[191]. As a result, the LDPE-AAEM showed a OH¡ anion conductivity
of 145 mS cm¡1 at 80°C with 95% RH and a Cl¡ anion conductivity of
76 mS cm¡1 at 80°C when fully hydrated. It was indicated that the
LDPE-AAEM outperformed the ETFE-AAEM in an AAEMFC, which
was attributed to higher anion conductivity and enhanced in situ
water transport. It was worthwhile to note that the LDPE-AAEM was
more mechanically robust than ETFE-AAEM, resulting in the ability
to routinely evaluate them in fuel cells at 80°C, whereas the ETFE-
AAEM was limited to operation at 60°C.

Importantly,

PIn summary, various materials based AAEMs have been synthe-
sized, and the performance of the fabricated MEAs have been evalu-
ated in H2/O2 fuel cells subsequently. Meanwhile, novel structures in
the MEA have been proposed, which possess superior properties
than conventional MEAs. Though significant progress has been made
in developing AAEMs with high performance as well as low cost, it
should be noted that the AAEMs are still facing variety of challenges,
including hydroxide-ion conductivity, as well as mechanical, chemi-
cal, and thermal stability.

6. Single-cell: designs and performance

6.1. Effect of anode ionomers

PIn the anode, novel ionomers and fine microstructures have been
proposed for the enhancement of the mass transport and current
collection [192(cid:1)196]. Recently, Sun et al. [192] prepared pendant
quaternary ammonium-based ionomers employing styrene-ethyl-
ene/butylene-styrene (SEBS) as the starting material, which were
dimensionally stable without drastic sacrifice of the ionic conductiv-
ity as compared to the polysulfone (PSf)-based ionomers. It was indi-
cated that a peak power density of 210 mW cm¡2 was obtained in a
single cell using Pt (1.28 mg cm¡2) both at the anode and cathode
with hydrogen (RH = 100%) and oxygen (RH = 100%) fed at a rate of
200 sccm at 50°C. They demonstrated that the superior performance
of the ionomers was attributed to the lower internal resistance and
charge transfer resistance owing to the excellent dimensional stabil-
ity and the balanced conductivity-hydrophobicity. Matsumoto et al.
[193] described a novel structure composed of CNTs and KOH-doped
PBI, forming a nanometer thickness wrapping layer, on which the Pt
nanoparticles were loaded, as shown in Fig. 7(a) and (b). It was
shown that the CNTs and the KOH-doped PBI layer functioned
as electron and hydroxide conductive pathways, respectively. The
sufficient formation of the interfacial structure resulted in the
excellent mass transport around the TPBs. A peak power density of
256 mW cm¡2 was achieved with the newly developed electrode
fabricated with Pt (0.45 mg cm¡2) both at the anode and cathode
when hydrogen (RH = 95%) and oxygen (RH = 95%) were supplied at
flow rates of 100 and 200 sccm, respectively, which is much higher
than that of the AS-4 cell primarily due to the better mass transport.
Yang et al. [194] reported that the ionomer content played an impor-
tant role in the cell activation, ohmic and concentration losses and
resulted in a high-performance electrode with fine microstructure
synthesized by 20 wt% ionomer content and the proper dispersion
solvent, including solutions and colloid. It was indicated when the
n-butyl acetate (NBA) worked as solvent and ionomer content was
kept at 20 wt%, the colloidal electrode increased the pore volume
and pore diameter, serialized ionomer networks and decreased
ohmic and concentration losses, resulting in a peak power density of
407 mW cm¡2 in an AAEMFC fabricated with Pt (0.4 mg cm¡2) both
at anode and cathode with hydrogen (RH = 100%) fed at a flow rate
of 100 sccm and oxygen (RH = 100%) fed at a flow rate of 200 sccm at
50°C. Ewing et al. [195] synthesized dendritic nano-sized nickel
nanoparticles via a hydrazine reduction method in ethylene glycol

Pfrom a nickel chloride precursor. They characterized the resulting
particles by XRD, TEM, and SEM. The results showed that the single
nickel particles gradually connected to form nickel chains, and sub-
sequently the chains connected to form the dendritic structures. Fur-
thermore, the nickel particle was amorphous, which provided more
active sites. In addition, they used the dendritic nickels with a net-
work structure as the anode for an AAEMFC, resulting in a current
density of 11.5 mA cm¡2. Kucernak et al. [196] proposed porous sil-
ver membranes as potential substrates for gas transport electrodes
in alkaline fuel cells. The silver membrane possessed three inte-
grated functions,
including electrocatalytic function, mechanical
support and current collection. An OCV of 1.05 V and a maximum
power density of 60 mW cm¡2 were obtained in an alkaline AAEMFC
constructed with these electrodes with Pt (0.05 mg cm¡2) both at
anode and cathode with hydrogen (RH = 75%) and oxygen (RH = 75%)
at 50°C. It was indicated that the gas transport layers were as three
times expensive as carbon-based layers, but especially considering
their significantly reduced thickness, 700-fold superior electrical
conductance, and thermal conductivity, the Ag electrode still had
the potential to be used in AAEMFCs.

PIn summary, the ionomers play an important role in enhancing
the mass transport and lowering internal resistance that further
leads to superior power output. In addition, the well-dispersed elec-
trocatalysts result in the sufficient TPBs, which is beneficial to
improving the cell performance.

6.2. Effect of cathode ionomers

PIn the cathode, novel
ionomers and structures have been

different quaternary ammonium density and evaluated the perfor-
mance via impedance spectroscopy and voltammetry. The obtained
results indicated that the limited cell performance on the cathode
was the low catalyst utilization, which was primarily attributed to
the low ionic conductivities and high WUs of the AEIs. Hence, tre-
mendous efforts have been devoted into synthesizing various ion-
omers with high hydroxide ions conductivity and low WU for
promoting the mass transport in order to enhance the catalyst utili-
zation. Gu et al. [198] reported a phosphonium based ionomer
(TPQPOH) and simply used it to prepare the catalyst layer with Ag.
The Ag(cid:1)phosphonium ionomer interface yielded a high peak power

Pdensity of 208 mW cm¡2, which was more than double of that of the
Ag(cid:1)ammonium ionomer interface and slightly higher than that of

tion method to elevate the performance by tailoring the ionomer
distribution and balancing the ionic, electronic, and reactant trans-
port within the catalyst layer as shown in Fig. 8(a) and (b). It was
shown that the maximum power density was promoted from
44 mW cm¡2 to 120 mW cm¡2 via the ionomer impregnation
method, and further increased to 315 mW cm¡2 via adding hydro-
phobic additive with Pt (0.5 mg cm¡2) both at anode and cathode at
70°C due to the higher catalyst utilization and free volumes close to
diffusion layer. Zhou et al. [200] prepared a series of partially fluori-
nated copoly(arylene ether) alkaline ionomers (QAPAE) via chloro-
methylation of copoly(arylene ether) followed by amination with
trimethylamine. The WU of QAPAE was significantly reduced
because of the presence of the hydrophobic octafluoro-biphenyl
groups in the backbone. It was demonstrated that the QAPAE-4 and
QAPSF ionomers employed as cathode in a hybrid AAEM/PEM fuel
cell fabricated with Pt (0.5 mg cm¡2) both at anode and cathode uti-
lizing humidified hydrogen as fuel and oxygen as oxidant yielded
the peak power density of 315 mW cm¡2 and 215 mW cm¡2 at 60°C,
respectively. The interfacial adhesion of MEAs still remained a chal-
lenge because the hydrocarbon ionomer possessed low binding abil-
ity. Kubo et al. [201] reported the effect of hydroxide-ion conducting
layered double hydroxides (LDHs) on the ORR. Two types of LDH

were prepared, denoted as Ni(cid:1)Al CO3
It was indicated that the addition of LDHs to the catalyst layer
increased the reduction current for ORR due to the introduced
OH¡conducting paths and the increased TPB region. In addition, the
2¡ LDH possessed better performance than the Mg(cid:1)Al
Ni(cid:1)Al CO3
2¡ LDH. Tamain et al. [202] came up with a hypothesis that the
CO3
limited power output was mainly attributed to limitation of the
mass transport of reactant water to the cathode reaction sites, which
kept the membrane hydrated for sufficient conductivity. Hence, the
hydrophobic binder, PTFE, was replaced by Toray carbon paper, aim-
ing at improving the characteristics of the water transport. The
H2/O2 fuel cell with the cathode fabricated from Toray carbon paper
and Pt/C catalyst (20 wt% Pt on Vulcan XC-72R carbon support)
resulted in a peak power density of 125 mW cm¡2, which was
25(cid:1)36% more than the power output compared to the that of the
fuel cells fabricated with the PTFE-containing cathodes.

PIn summary, the ionomers on the cathode play an important role
in the property of the cathode. It should be noted that lower WUs,
higher ionic conductivities, and higher catalyst utilizations result in
the improvement of the power output. In addition, since water is
consumed in cathode, humidification of oxygen is necessary in cath-
ode. Otherwise, the ORR is difficult to proceed in the absence of
water at the cathode.

6.3. Effect of structural designs

PThe performance of the AAEMFC lies on three primary parame-
ters as follows: (1) the electrocatalysts for HOR and ORR that deter-
mine the electrochemical kinetics; (2) the structure of MEA that
influences the transport of mass, ions, and electrons; and (3) the
operation conditions that affect the electrochemical and transport
behaviors and thus the power output.

PIn addition to the development of novel electrocatalysts for the
HOR and ORR, the effects of structural designs also have been investi-
gated [16,203,204]. It is widely believed that a superior design of
flow field, anode, and cathode leads to a better performance, result-
ing from the enhanced mass transport and the sufficient TPBs. It
should be noted that the mass transport also plays an important role
in the fuel cell performance. For the mass transport in the anode, it
is vitally important to design the flow field and diffusion layer to
lead hydrogen to distribute as even as possible, maximizing the cell
voltage. On the cathode, the critical mass transport issues can be con-
cluded as follows: (1) it is necessary to design the flow field and dif-
fusion layer; (2) it is critical to enhance the transport of oxygen in
the through-plane direction; (3) in the in-plane direction, the distri-
bution of oxygen needs to be uniform over the CL. For the mass
transport through the membrane, the key issue is to suppress the
hydrogen crossover so that the mixed potential problem can be alle-
viated and hydrogen will not be wasted. The reduction of crossover
can be achieved when the design of the MEA is optimal, particularly
the cathode backing layer and microporous layer. Mamlouk et al.
[203] studied the effects of ionomer content, anode and cathode CL
thicknesses, and membrane thickness on the performance of an
AAEMFC.
It was indicated that an optimum ionomer content
depended on a balance between the OH¡ ion/water mobility and the
oxygen solubility/diffusivity through it. When the ionomer content in
the CL was too high, the mass transport through the ionomer could
be impeded. Moreover, the electrocatalyst and carbon particles could
be electron-isolated. When too low, the insufficient ECSA resulted in
the lower utilization of the electrocatalysts. In addition, the limiting
OH¡ mobility leaded to the larger ohmic loss. It was suggested that
thick anode CL was necessary because the flooding problem could be
avoided when the fuel cell was operated at high current densities,
meaning that more water was produced in the anode CL. Meanwhile,
the effect of the cathode CL on the performance have been studied. It
was indicated that an optimum of
the cathode CL thickness
depended on the operating conditions, including oxygen partial pres-
sure and ionomer used. A thicker CL with smaller particle size might
suffer from the oxygen starvation problem, when the oxygen supply
was inadequate. While a thinner layer with larger particle size might
not possess the enough ECSA. The AAEM, the key component of the
AAEMFC, worked as the barrier separating the anode and cathode, as
well as the pathway for OH¡ transport. Thus, the optimal membrane
thickness lay on the equilibrium of the OH¡ transport and gas per-
meability. The single fuel cell tests showed that the membrane with
hydrated thickness of 57 mm resulted in a peak power density of
337 mW cm¡2 with the air at 60°C.

6.4. Effect of water flooding

PAdditionally, water management is critical to achieve better per-
formance and durability. In AAEMFCs, water is produced in the

Panode and consumed in the cathode. Therefore, the flooding prob-
lem that limits the cell performance is more likely to arise in the
anode. To achieve a better power output, it is essential to undertake
water management to mitigate the flooding problem. Zhang et al.
[16] confirmed that the direction of water movement was from the
anode to the cathode via a water collection method, which indicated
the diffusion water was much larger than the electro-osmosis water.
At high current densities, much more water moved from the anode
to cathode, which not only alleviates the flooding problem at the
anode but also reduces membrane resistance. Oshiba et al. [204] pro-
posed two methods to suppress the anode flooding. One was to
increase the anode flow rate: when the RH at the anode outlet
reached 100%, the current density increased with the anode flow
rate, indicating that the anode flooding problem was alleviated. The
other was to reduce the membrane thickness: when the membrane
became thinner, the water produced in the anode was easily perme-
ated to the cathode. Recently, Omasta et al. [205] pointed out that
the amount and balance of water was a critical issue to obtain high
performance that could be achieved by tuning the cell water to opti-
mize the dynamic balance between membrane hydration and elec-
trode flooding/dry-out. It was indicated that the cell water was able
to be actively manipulated via several variables, including gas feed
dew points, catalyst layer hydrophobicity, anode and cathode gas
flow rates, flow channel design, catalyst layer engineering, and the
physicochemical properties of the AAEM and AEIs.

6.5. Single-cell durability

PDurability of fuel cells is one of the critical issues in realizing the
commercialization [206(cid:1)208]. Hence, Slade et al. [206] demon-
strated that the AAEMs must be evaluated in H2/O2, H2/air, and
methanol/air fuel cells for several thousand hours to ensure ade-
quate in-situ membrane stability. Though some synthesized AAEMs
exhibited exceptional fuel cell performance, the poor durability has
still not been solved yet. Luo et al. [207] proposed two strategies to
improve the durability of QPMBV membranes. The first was to
increase glass transition temperature and molecular weight via
eliminating butyl acrylate from the monomers. The second was to
reduce the WU and SR via crosslinking to lock the functionalized
QPMV into a poly (divinylbenzene) (PDVB) polymer network. It was
indicated that the fuel cell employing crosslinked QPMV-PDVB
AAEM could continuously work for 420 h at 50°C and 146 h at 70°C,
which was eight and three times longer than that in previous study,
respectively, as shown in Fig. 9(a) and (b). Fujimoto et al. [208]
investigated the backbone stability of benzyl-trimethyl ammonium
(BTMA) functionalized polyaromatics in two structurally differing
polymer architectures: quaternized poly(aryleneether) (PAE) and PP.
It was indicated that the cleavage of aryl-ether linkages substantially
impacted the mechanical properties and moderately the hydroxide
conductivity. The results showed that the PAE MEA experienced fail-
ure at 55 h due to the degraded mechanical stability while the PP
MEA exhibited stable performance during 300-h operation.

6.6. Single-cell performance

PHerein, we summarize the peak power densities reported in the
recent literatures. Tables 1(cid:1)4 show the selected hydrogen/oxygen
fuel cell performance with different HOR electrocatalysts, ORR
electrocatalysts, AAEMs, and MEA structures, respectively. It can be
seen from Tables that power density has been boosted from
»0.4 mW cm¡2 to 1450 mW cm¡2 in recent years, suggesting that
the AAEMFC is a promising energy technology and tremendous
efforts have been paid into this field [70,74,97,190,191,194,
205,209,210]. Hu et al. [74] fabricated an AAEMFC, which exhibited
the highest power density of 40 mW cm¡2 with humidified hydro-
gen and oxygen both at a flow rate of 50 sccm at 60°C, when Ni(cid:1)W

P(17.5 mg cm¡2), CoPPY/C (2 mg cm¡2), and xQAPS were employed as
anode electrocatalyst, cathode electrocatalyst and AAEM, respec-
tively. Carmo et al. [209] developed an AAEMFC with 20 wt% Pt/C
(0.8 mg cm¡2) and 25% FAA-3 ionomer in the catalyst layer for both
the cathode and anode. It was indicated that a peak power density of
223 mW cm¡2 was obtained using hydrogen (100% humidity) as fuel
at 200 sccm and oxygen (100% humidity) as oxidation at 200 sccm.
In addition, the platinum requirement could be decreased to
0.5 mg cm¡2 without sacrificing the performance. Recently, Ohyama
et al. [70] developed a fuel cell employing 0.5 mg cm¡2 Ru/C (3 nm)

Pas anode electrocatalyst, 0.5 mg cm¡2 Pt/C as cathode electrocata-
lyst, and an AAEM (Tokuyama A201), resulting in an excellent peak
power density of 250 mW cm¡2. The significant enhancement was
substantially attributed to the larger surface area per unit weight of
Ru/C, which resulted in the higher limiting current density. He et al.
[97] reported a novel cathode electrocatalyst, CoO/rGO(N). The
results from the fuel cell tests showed that the peak power density
reached 387 mW cm¡2 with the hydrogen (62% RH) fed to the anode
at a rate of 250 sccm and the oxygen (100% RH) fed to the cathode at
a rate of 200 sccm, when the Pt and CoO/rGO(N) are employed as

Panode electrocatalyst and cathode electrocatalyst, respectively, as
well as an AAEM (Tokuyama A201). Yang et al. [194] fabricated high-
performance electrodes with fine microstructure by changing the
content of the ionomer and selecting the appropriate dispersion sol-
vent. A maximum power density of 358 mW cm¡2 was achieved
when the ionomer content is 20 wt% (CCM-I20) with humidified H2
in the anode at a rate of 100 sccm and humidified O2 in the cathode
at a rate of 200 sccm at 50°C, which is three and five times of CCM-
I25 and CCM I10, respectively. Importantly, the peak power density
increased remarkably to 407 mW cm¡2 when the dispersion solution
changed to NBA. Recently, Wang et al. [210] found that the highest
power density of 1000 mW cm¡2 was obtained when Pt(cid:1)Ru
(0.4 mg cm¡2) is utilized as anode electrocatalyst, Pt (0.4 mg cm¡2)
is used as cathode electrocatalyst, and H2 and O2 were fed at flow
rates at 400 sccm at 60°C, which was 400 mW cm¡2 higher than the
performance of a fuel cell running under the same conditions apart
from the unitary anode electrocatalyst Pt as shown in Fig. 9(c). It has
been revealed that the enhancement in the kinetics of the HOR was
attributed to weakening the Pt(cid:1)Had interaction rather than the ever
reported oxophilic effect. Breakthroughs in power output has been
reported vary recently [190,191,205], as shown in Fig. 9(d) (e) and
(f). A peak power density of 1.4 Wcm¡2 was achieved with hydro-
gen and oxygen both at a flow rate of 1000 sccm at 60°C, when
PtRu (0.67 mg cm¡2) and Pt (0.53 mg cm¡2) were employed as
anode electrocatalyst and cathode electrocatalyst, respectively
[205]. More importantly, the dew points for the electrode configu-
ration was optimized to 54/57°C, which was the same thing as RHs
equal to 75%/85%. The spectacular performance was primarily
attributed to the optimal balance between necessary membrane
hydration and electrode flooding/dry-out. To date, 1.4 W cm¡2 was
the highest peak power density at 60°C. As Wang et al. [191] devel-
oped a LDPE-AAEM that possessed the ability to be routinely evalu-
ated in fuel cells at 80°C, the H2/O2 AAEMFC fabricated with
this AAEM, a PtRu/C anode (0.4 mg cm¡2), and a Pt/C cathode
(0.4 mg cm¡2) exhibited a peak power density as high as
1.45 W cm¡2. It was claimed that avoiding anode flooding and
enhancing supply of H2O to the cathode reaction sites contributed
to the splendid power output. Since the reactant diffusion limita-
tions in anode and cathode at high current densities were more
serious at 80°C than 60°C, the effects of the water management on
the performance were more significant.

7. Innovative system designs

7.1. Hybrid fuel cells

PRecently, some innovative structures have been proposed with
€
Unl€u
the purpose of improving the fuel cell performance [211(cid:1)216].
et al. [211] developed a novel hybrid polymer electrolyte fuel cell, as
shown in Fig. 10(a), in which the hybrid membrane was composed
of a proton exchange membrane sandwiched by two AAEMs,
denoted as AAEM/PEM/AAEM fuel cell, simplifying water manage-
ment and avoiding CO poisoning. The hybrid fuel cell fabricated with
Pt (0.5 mg cm¡2) both at anode and cathode exhibited a peak power
density of 55.6 mW cm¡2 with H2 (RH = 100%) and O2 (RH = 100%)
supplied at a rate of 360 and 480 sccm, respectively. The peak power
density increased to 78.3 mW cm¡2 at 0% RH under the same condi-
tions. They claimed that the unpredictable phenomenon was attrib-
uted to the superior water management configuration. However,
Shen et al. [212] developed a type of non-flooding hybrid polymer
fuel cell, in which a PEM and an AAEM were pressed together. They
found that the performance was improved with increasing the tem-
perature and relative humidity, which was opposed to the results
€
Unl€u et al. [211]. Zhang et al. [213] developed a hybrid
reported by
system consisting of an alkaline fuel cell and a heat-driven cycle as
shown in Fig. 10(b), which reused the waste heat to improve the
maximum equivalent power output. The hybrid system showed
superior performance, which was 1.4 times higher than that
€
Unl€u et al. [214] proposed a novel
achieved by a single AAEMFC.
hybrid anion and proton exchange membrane fuel cell, denoted as
AAEM cathode/PEM anode and PEM anode/AAEM cathode, as shown
in Fig. 10(c), which exploited the electrochemical advantages of the
high-pH operation due to at least one electrode being at high pH.
They illustrated that the AAEM cathode/PEM anode junction failed
at high current densities resulting from the inadequate flux of water
to the AAEM/PEM interface where water dissociated into hydrogen
ions (which migrates to the cathode) and hydroxide ions (which
migrates to the anode). On the contrary, the PEM anode/AAEM cath-
ode junction was shown to be an available configuration. Despite
the modest power density, the type of structure exhibited steady
performance with 0% relative humidity at 65°C for a three-day con-
tinuous operation, whereas the conventional fuel cell experienced
severe degradation over the same time without humidification. They

Palso evaluated the effect of RH, ionomer content in the anion-con-
ductive electrode and the inlet gas flow rates on the performance of
the hybrid fuel cells, as shown in Fig. 10(d) [215]. The results showed
that the ionomer fraction of the high-pH cathode played an impor-
tant role in the performance, which was limited by the availability of
oxygen in the active sites resulting from the flooding in the cathode.
When the gases were fed at high flow rates, the water removal from
cathode was enhanced and the flooding problem was eliminated.
Fukuta et al. [216] tested the optimization of MEA construction
employing newly developed membrane and ionomer by Tokuyama,
which was one of the leading developers of electrolyte materials for
AAEMFCs, to improve the power density. They suggested that the
optimized MEA was fabricated with ionomer: AS-X (Pt/C: AS-
X = 70:30), membrane: A901, and Pt (0.5 mg cm¡2) both at the anode
and cathode, exhibiting a peak power density of 450 mW cm¡2 with
humidified hydrogen at a flow rate of 1000 sccm and pure oxygen at
a flow rate of 2000 sccm. In summary, several novel structure
designs that are mainly associated with the MEA construction have
been proposed. As a result, the performance is promoted due to the
superior water management, the use of preferable pH value, and the
low degradation rate of membrane.

7.2. Regenerative fuel cells

PRegenerative fuel cell (RFC) is not only an energy conversion
device, but an energy storage machine, which typically employs
hydrogen as a flexible energy carrier, as shown in Fig. 11. It is the
concept that the fabricated electrodes, which exhibit catalytic activi-
ties for both ORR and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), can be used
as either electrolyzer or a fuel cell. When the AAEM-RFC is working
as an electrolyzer, water reacts with electrons to produce hydrogen
and hydroxide ions at the cathode according to:
(cid:1) þ 2H2
4H2O þ 4e(cid:1) ! 4OH

ð16Þ
PThe hydroxide ions are transported through the AAEM to the
anode catalyst layer where the hydroxide ions are oxidized to
release electrons, oxygen and water according to:

4OH

(cid:1) ! 2H2O þ 4e(cid:1) þ O2

PThe produced hydrogen is stored on site after the electrolysis,
and can be used as fuel in the fuel cell anode subsequently when the
electricity is needed. The reactions of the fuel cell mode have been
mentioned earlier take place. Though the RFC is a particular candi-
date for storing renewable electricity, the high cost still is the pri-
mary impediment for the commercialization. The main reason for
the high cost is ascribed to the use of platinum group metal catalysts.
Ng et al. [217] developed a bifunctional Ni based on carbon black (Ni/
C) electrocatalyst for the H2 electrode because the Ni possessed cata-
lytical activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the
HOR. It was shown that the Ni/C electrocatalyst exhibited compara-
ble activity to the Pt/C electrocatalyst at low potentials, while the
activity began to decrease at high potential due to the Ni oxidation.
Meanwhile, they synthesized a precious-metal free and carbon-free
O2 electrode via electrodeposition of manganese oxide (MnOx) on a
stainless steel (SS) substrate followed by high-temperature calcina-
tion at 480°C [218]. It was revealed that the fabricated electrode pos-
sessed comparable oxygen reduction and water oxidation activities
and durability to the precious-metal based electrode, which was
attributed to avoiding the carbon corrosion. Wu et al. [219] prepared
four nanometer size CuxMn0.9¡xCo2.1O4 samples (x = 0, 0.3, 0.6, and
0.9) as a non-precious metal based bifunctional oxygen electrode for
the use in regenerative fuel cells and studied their characteristics
with XRD, SEM, TEM, and cyclic voltammetry. It was indicated that
the CuxMn0.9¡xCo2.1O4 electrode exhibited promising ORR activity
which was similar to Pt/C electrode and a peak power density of
80 mW cm¡2 was obtained. Meanwhile, in electrolyzer mode, the
prepared electrode showed better OER catalytic activity, with
100 mV more negative onset potentials. Matsushima et al. [220]
investigated the three-phase interfacial phenomena in alkaline
regenerative fuel cell by a charge-coupled device (CCD) and confocal
laser microscopy. It was shown from the results that the hydroxide
ions reduced the surface tension, resulting in the spread of the
three-phase interface. Consequently, the ORR was promoted as a
result of the obvious enlargement of the reaction surface and the
short diffusion path of dissolved oxygen. On the other hand, the OER

Pwas enhanced by the convectional factor of gas evolution. In sum-
mary, to develop a cost-effective energy storage technology that is
for grid-scale applications, it is crucial to realize the utilization of
renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. Undoubtedly, the
RFCs using solar and wind are composed the idea of circulation and
the concept of sustainable. Although great progress has been made,
one issue needs to be addressed. Currently, the precious metals are
mainly the electrocatalysts both in anode and cathode, leading to
the high cost of the RFCs. As a result, the commercialization is shad-
owed. Hence, it is urgent to develop non-precious metal electrocata-
the non-precious metal
lysts to reduce the cost. However,
electrocatalysts in one electrode are generally not effective enough
to catalyze the two reactions. Hence, future direction is to synthesize
cost-efficient electrocatalysts with highly catalytic activity.

8. Mathematical modeling

PAs an economical and useful tool, mathematical modeling can
play a significant role in the quantification of the intricate physico-
chemical processes in AAEMFCs. Hence, various models have been
conducted on predicting the hydroxyl anion conductivity [221], ana-
lyzing the concentration profile of carbonate ions [222], and study-
ing the effect of design and operating parameters on the fuel cell
performance [223(cid:1)232]. Jiao et al. [223] developed a three-dimen-
sional multiphase model to investigate the effect of design and oper-
ating parameters on the heat and mass transfer characteristics and
performance. It was indicated the power output was improved
sharply with more anode humidification at the range of 50(cid:1)80%,
whereas the enhancement was less significant at higher humidifica-
tion levels. Moreover, the cathode humidification played a more
important role than that of anode, showing a positive effect on per-
formance, especially at high current densities. When the liquid
water volume fraction on the cathode reached 0.02, the liquid water
began to move from channels to the CL. With the liquid water vol-
ume fraction increasing to 0.08, a balance was formed between the
anode and the cathode. The performance was promoted with the

Pdecrease of the membrane thickness due to the reduction of the
mass transport loss between the anode and the cathode. Deng et al.
[226] developed a 3-D multiphase non-isothermal model for the
whole hydrogen-fed AAEMFC. It was shown from the results that the
insertion of anode MPL, increment of anode back pressure and dec-
rement of membrane thickness generally improved the cell perfor-
mance. In addition, the water behavior was also studied and it was
found that at high current densities, no water was observed in the
cathode due to the electro-osmotic drag by ion transport and con-
sumption as the reactant; while, at low current densities, liquid
water may exist in cathode arising from improving the anode back
diffusion or reducing the membrane thickness. When anode back
pressure increased and membrane thickness decreased, the water
transport from anode to cathode was changed from diffusion domi-
nated to diffusion/hydraulic permeation dominated. Huo et al. [227]
developed a numerical model to investigate the water transport in
the anode. Fig. 12(a) depicted the distributions of liquid water in
anode catalyst layer and gas diffusion layer. It was indicated that the
current density and temperature were two crucial parameters influ-
encing the liquid water transport. Since the current density
increased from 0.05 to 1.45 A cm¡2, the liquid water volume fraction
in the anode increased due to more water produced and dragged to
the anode. In addition, the liquid water volume fraction in the anode
decreased with the temperature due to more water evaporated, sug-
gesting that the anode flooding was suppressed. Shiau et al. [228]
developed a two-dimensional nonisothermal multiphase model to
investigate the effects of operation condition on the performance.
When the gases were fully humidified, the current density was
higher than that of partially humidified, which was ascribed to
enhanced ORR kinetics and ion/water transport through the mem-
brane. The performance was also improved with increasing temper-
ature due to the same reasons. A theoretical analysis conducted by
Deng et al. [229] showed that a higher ionomer content resulted in a
better performance under various gas relative humidity due to the
improved membrane hydration and enhanced ionic conductivity. As
the cathode might suffer from large performance losses resulting

Pfrom the lack of water, properly increasing the water amount in
cathode could effectively reduce mass transport and ohmic losses.
Moreover, slight anode pressurization and insertion of MPL were
preferred. However, Huo et al. [230] argued that the best configura-
tion was only inserting MPL in anode rather than placing MPLs both
in anode and cathode as shown in Fig. 12(b). It was explained that
the MPL implemented in anode forced the liquid water to back-dif-
fuse to the cathode and MPL eliminated in cathode enhanced the
water transport to the cathode CL, both of which led to a high reac-
tion rate and membrane conductivity. Besides, decreasing the cath-
ode CL contact angle improves the performance because more water
could be kept in the cathode CL decreasing polarization losses. Nev-
ertheless, attention should be paid into the possibility of cathode
flooding problem. Recently, Niu et al. [231] took the two-phase tur-
bulent flow in fuel cell flow channel into consideration, which was
largely ignored in previous studies. They developed a direct numeri-
cal simulation (DNS) model with modified volume-of-fluid (VOF)
approach for tracking the air/water interface. It could be seen from
Fig. 12(c) that the water droplet was deformed asymmetrically and
became water films spreading on the GDL surface, which was advan-
tageous for reducing the flow resistance. Whereas such water films
were difficult to be removed, therefore, the reactant supply was sup-
pressed. Subsequently, the DNS model was used to investigate the
behavior of two droplets and three droplets in turbulent and laminar
flows [232]. Fig. 12(d) depicted the proccess. In the two-droplet case,
the front droplet firstly became flat and moved towards the other
one. Eventually, they were merged in turbulent flow. In the laminar
flow, the two droplets were also merged and the finally merged
droplet was higher. In the three-droplet case, the two droplets
downstream were merged firstly, followed by combining with the
front droplet in turbulent flow. It was similar that the three droplets

Pwere merged and the finally merged droplet was higher in the lami-
nar flow. Since the liquid films formed on the GDL surface moved
slowly, a hydrophobic GDL surface was required for water removal
enhancement.

PIn summary, along with the experiments, modeling and simula-
tion play a critical role in providing detailed insights concerning the
complex mass, heat and charged particle transport in an AAEMFC.
Modeling is especially important when an experiment is either too
expensive to conduct or unable to capture the detailed underlying
physics. As the modeling studies are conducted on investigating the
mass transport phenomenon in the AAEMFCs, particularly on the
water management, the results can be expressed: anode flooding
can be a critical issue at 100% RH, whereas at lower RH high ionic
transport resistance in the cathode dominates due to dehydrated
ionomer phase at high current, where the impact of water-consum-
ing ORR kinetic polarization is also crucial.

9. Remaining challenges and perspectives

PPlatinum has been widely used as electrocatalyst both in anode
and cathode due to its desirable electrochemical activities. However,
the high cost becomes the main constraint, which makes the
AAEMFC less attractive.

PFor the anode electrocatalysts, although the HOR is the simplest
electrochemical reaction, high activity catalysts are in urgent need
due to the less active HOR in basic media than that in acid media.
Thus, the Pt alloys and hybrid structures with high activity and low
cost have been proposed. However, there are still several problems
needed for further investigation, which can be concluded as fol-
lows: (1) synthesizing highly active non-PGM electrocatalysts;

P(2) improving the durability of the electrocatalysts in hash alkaline
media; (3) studying the HOR process on electrocatalysts.

PFor the cathode electrocatalysts, considerable improvements
have been made to synthesize novel ORR electrocatalysts to replace
the Pt recently, but there are still remaining some problems
unsolved, i.e. the low stability, the high overpotential, and the low
reactivity. The proposed alternative non-PGM electrocatalysts are
supposed to enhance the direct four-electron pathway and inhibit
the formation of hydrogen peroxide, resulting in the promotion of
the catalytic activity. Although many non-platinum electrocatalysts
showing comparable activity to Pt have been prepared, as men-
tioned earlier, the durability and stability problems still should be
addressed.

PAs the key component of the MEA, the AAEM is directly related to
the fuel cell performance. Hence, it should be pointed out the future
research direction for the synthesis of the membrane as well as the
ionomer. Tang et al. [233] and Slade et al. [206] have indicated that
the dissoluble ionomer is essential because the ionomer can be
impregnated into the pores of the porous electrodes, working as a
binder that can significantly decrease the interfacial resistance. Zeng
et al. [234] found that the fundamental improvement of the fuel cell
performance was attributed to the water removal from the surface
of catalyst. Hence, a low swelling ionomer film with a highly hydro-
philic surface is recommended. In addition, for the application of the
AAEMFCs, the AAEM is expected to work normally at a wider range
of temperature. Consequently, the AAEMs are required to be ther-
mally stable. On the other hand, the thin films also need to be
mechanically stable, being both flexible and strong.

PAs an economical and useful tool, mathematical modeling can
play a significant role in the quantification of the intricate physico-
chemical processes in AAEMFCs. However, as composed to the
extensive experiment research on the AAEMFCs, mathematical
modeling has not received similar attention. Moreover, the limited
modeling studies are conducted on investigating the mass transport
phenomenon in the AAEMFCs, particularly on the water manage-
ment. Although water management has been verified to have vital
effects on the fuel cell performance, the modeling research on the
electrochemical process on the CLs is still deficient. Herein, we sug-
gest that more attention should be focused on the modeling and
mathematical analysis.

10. Concluding remarks

PAs the promising emerging energy technology, the AAEMFC has
attracted worldwide attention recently due to the significant reduc-
tion of the cost. Consequently, great progress has been made in pro-
moting the power density, enhancing the durability, as well as
reducing the cost. Generally, the peak power density is related to
temperature, DL porosity, tuned ionomer carbon ratios, electrocata-
lyst loadings, and carefully controlled RHs. Typically, the perfor-
mance increases with the increasing temperature due to the
enhanced electrode reaction kinetics. Whereas, too high tempera-
ture is harmful to those components that are not stable enough,
resulting in the performance degradation. Besides, higher DL poros-
ity a lower mass/charge transport resistance, which is advantageous
for improving power output. Nevertheless, a DL also functions as an
electron transmitter and a CL supporter. Too high porosity is unfa-
vorable for electron transport and mechanical support. Hence, an
optimal DL porosity can be determined by taking these three aspects
into consideration. The ionomer content has synergetic effects on
the electrode microstructure and kinetic properties in terms of the
active, ohmic, and mass diffusion polarizations. A deficient ionomer
content in the CLs leads to non-continuous network for aiding the
hydroxide transport, correspondingly lessening the reactive TPBs,
and reducing the electrocatalyst utilization. However, an overload-
ing ionomer content results in high shielding of electrocatalysts and

Pheavy blocking of surface pores, which impedes the H2 and O2 in the
process of diffusing to the electrocatalyst particles for carrying out
the electrode reactions. Within an appropriate range, increasing
electrocatalyst loading is beneficial for promoting peak power den-
sity, but too much loading will cause the agglomeration of electroca-
talyst and decrease of active sites. Notably, humidifying both
hydrogen and oxygen is obligatory. Considering the best perfor-
mance to date, the RHs are 75% on anode and 85% on cathode. Too
high RHs will result in electrode flooding problem, and too low RHs
will result in low ORR kinetics and sluggish OH¡ conductivity.

PThis review provides an overview of the recent development on
the AAEMFC, in terms of the physical and chemical processes, the
electrocatalysts toward the HOR and ORR, the system designs and
performance, as well as the remaining challenges and perspectives.
Although promising, there is still plenty room for substantially
increasing the power output before the widespread application. Fur-
ther development of the AAEMFC may concentrate on, but not be
limited to the following: (1) synthesize high activity, high durability,
and non-PGM electrocatalysts for both hydrogen oxidation reaction
and oxygen reduction reaction; (2) identify the active sites of the
electrocatalysts, which is critical for understanding the catalytic
mechanism and designing new electrocatalysts; (3) develop the high
hydroxide-ion conductivity, low water uptake, and high durability
polymer electrolyte membrane; (4) optimize the electrode design
for high transport rates of mass, ions and electrons, including the
ionomers and structures; (5) optimize the operating conditions for
the maximum power output.
