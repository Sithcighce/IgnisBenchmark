1. Introduction

PAutomotive industry desperately requires technologies, which are
cleaner and efficient, improve ambient air quality in an efficient man-
ner, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help energy security. Fuel
and engine technologies used in transportation sector are therefore
Xof improving fuel economy and reducing emis-
facing twin challengesD
sions. Considering stringent emission regulations and scarcity of pri-
mary energy resources, development of new highly efficient and
environment friendly combustion concepts and systems, capable of
utilizing alternative fuels in addition to conventional
fuels, has
become increasingly important. Several experimental studies have
been carried out to develop novel combustion concept namely low
temperature combustion (LTC), which has demonstrated prospects of
meeting most stringent environmental legislations imposed on the
automotive sector. In recent years, researchers have focused on LTC
technologies primarily due to its potential for lowering emission and
achieving higher efficiency compared to conventional combustion
modes. LTC includes several techniques such as homogeneous charge
compression ignition (HCCI), premixed charge compression ignition
(PCCI), reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI), etc. All these
techniques are same as far as the fundamental principle is concerned
however they differ in methodology of implementation. This paper
reviews important research related to fundamental understanding,
development and challenges of LTC engine technology and prospects
in the direction of commercialization.

1.1. Principle of LTC

PLTC engines have a great potential to achieve high engine effi-
X and PM. This has attracted

ciency and ultra-low emissions of NOxD

Pattention of researchers and automotive industry alike. Significant
efforts are being made to understand the physical and chemical pro-
cesses involved in LTC, which affect engine performance and emis-
sions. Most common form of LTC is HCCI combustion, which works on
same fundamental principle as a 4-stroke engine and uses basic ele-
ments of CI and SI engines. The HCCI combustion is shown in Fig. 1.

PDuring the intake stroke, D

Xa nearly homogeneous fuel-air mixture
is introduced in the cylinder. After intake valve closing (IVC), the
piston starts compressing the fuel-air mixture, which increases in-
cylinder temperature and pressure. As the piston approaches top
dead center (TDC), charge attains auto-ignition conditions. Chemical
kinetics of charge can be enhanced by increasing charge temperature
in the beginning of the compression stroke by preheating the intake
air or by retaining a fraction of hot D
Xcombustion gas from the previous
engine cycle in the cylinder. In both strategies, chemical reactions

of combustion (SoC) in HCCI mode can be controlled by a combina-

these spots are called hot spots. This quick heat release causes pres-
sure rise in a significantly shorter time span compared to conven-
tional engines, while the peak cylinder temperature still remains
relatively significantly lower. The fuel-air mixture temperature and
pressure therefore increases further during the combustion. During

PMixture dilution by EGR also reduces HRR, thereby reducing knock-
ing probability.

PIn HCCI combustion, chemical reactions are not intimately cou-
pled to turbulent mixing processes such as those occurring in con-
ventional SI and CI engine combustion. Turbulent flow and heat
transfer mainly influenceD
X the initiation of auto-ignition process in
the in-cylinder charge. Prior to the main heat release, combustion
chemistry does not influence the fluid mechanics. Once heat release
starts, the combustion chemistry has a significant influence on flow,
primarily because of pressure and temperature rise in the combus-
tion chamber. However, the auto-ignition heat release is fast enough
to have insignificant effect on the flow in HCCI combustion. After the
main heat release, turbulent diffusion of combustion products is
likely to be coupled however very little heat is released [6].

PHCCI combustion can be achieved by both conventional fuels
namely mineral diesel and gasoline however different fuel proper-
ties of gasoline and mineral diesel require appropriate methodolo-
gies to achieve and control the HCCI combustion. Due to higher
evaporation temperature of mineral diesel compared to gasoline, it
cannot be injected in relatively colder combustion chamber condi-
tions. This means that port-injection or very early direct-injection
Xwould not be helpful. Homogeneous mixing
during intake stroke D
of mineral diesel with air is another serious challenge for achieving
diesel HCCI because very early injection results in issues such as
wall wetting, while very late injection leads to insufficient mixing.
Due to relatively lower auto-ignition temperature of mineral diesel,
HCCI engines cannot be operated at high CRs (i.e. normally used for
conventional diesel combustion). Lower cetane number of diesel
also necessitates EGR to control HRR during premixed combustion
phase. In contrast to mineral diesel, gasoline is highly volatile and
more resistant to auto-ignition. Therefore, necessary arrangements
are made so that fuel-air mixture temperature is sufficiently high in
order to facilitate auto-ignition closer to the end of the compression
stroke. In literature, several approaches such as intake air heating,
higher CR, variable valve timing (VVT), and re-circulating hot com-
bustion products have been investigated experimentally however
each method has its own merits and challenges [7].

PHCCI incorporates best features of both SI and CI combustion.
HCCI engines are far more efficient compared to SI engines and
approach the thermal efficiency of a CI engine. Improved thermal
efficiency is a result of three distinct features: (i) elimination of
throttling losses, (ii) use of high CRs (similar to CI engines), and (iii)
shorter combustion duration [8]. Comparison of D
Xbasic features of
HCCI combustion and conventional combustion concepts (SI and CI)
Xis presented in Table 1 [9].

P(c) Precise control of HRR to achieve trade-off between combustion

PDue to volumetric combustion throughout the combustion cham-
ber, HCCI combustion does not have any flame propagation. Fig. 2
shows the image sequence of HCCI combustion, in which non-flame
combustion can be clearly observed.

PFig. 2 clearly shows that combustion starts at several locations in
the combustion chamber simultaneously 2° D
XBTDC. After SoC at active
sites, the in-cylinder temperature and pressure increases and results
in bulk charge ignition over few crank angle degrees (0(cid:1)3 CAD). It
can be noticed that combustion duration is significantly shorter in
HCCI combustion engines (6(cid:1)15 CAD) compared to conventional
engines (30(cid:1)90 CAD). HRR significantly affects the HCCI combustion
because very short combustion duration results in violentD
Xknocking
combustion, whereas too long combustion duration may cause
incomplete combustion or misfire due to relatively lower in-cylinder
temperature in the expansion stroke. To avoid very high HRR,
charge is often diluted. Combustion duration is affected by dilution
of charge (by excess air or EGR or N2) because diluent absorbs heat
generated during combustion, thereby lowering peak in-cylinder
temperature. As a consequence, HCCI engine emits D

1.3. Challenges of LTC

PDue to several challenges associated with LTC, this technology
has not yet crossed commercialization threshold. While the process
itself has been known from over three decades, LTC can be achieved
only with those commercial engines, which are equipped with mod-
ern electronic control systems. Several technical challenges need to
be resolved before LTC can be utilized in high-volume production
and having applications in a wide range of vehicles, which can com-
pete with SI and CI engines. This section describes the main chal-
lenges encountered in developing practical LTC engines
for
transportation sector [9,12(cid:1)20] (Fig. 4).

P(i) Ignition timing and combustion rate control
PExpanding controlled operation of LTC engines over a wide range
of speeds and loads is a major challenge. Unlike conventional
engines, a direct method for controlling SoC (such as spark or fuel
injection) is not available in case of LTC engines. SoC in LTC is mainly
governed by chemical kinetics therefore LTC can be controlled by
physical and chemical properties of the fuel and the temperature-
time history of fuel-air mixture. Combustion phasing of LTC engines
is affected by several factors such as auto-ignition properties of test
fuel, relative fuel-air ratio, flow rate and reactivity of residual gases,
fuel-air mixture homogeneity, latent heat of vaporization of test
fuel, CR, intake air temperature, engine temperature, heat transfer
from the cylinder, and few other engine-dependent parameters [7].
The most challenging task for LTC implementation is to ensure that
auto-ignition occurs close to TDC, under various engine operating
conditions for optimal thermal efficiency.

PFor a perfectly homogeneous mixture, LTC ignition timing, com-
bustion characteristics, engine load, combustion efficiency and emis-
sions are governed mainly by these four factors: (a) Initial charge
composition; (b) Initial charge pressure and temperature condition;
(c) Rate and extent of compression work, and (d) Rate and distribu-
tion of heat transfer from the engine [20]. Heat transfer however

X and
PHCCI combustion has potential to greatly reduce NOxD
particulate emissions simultaneously. The region for formation of
NOxD
X and soot has been conceptualized in an equivalence ratio(cid:1)
temperature map, shown in Fig. 3 [10].

PNOx formation takes place at low equivalence ratio and high
adiabatic flame temperature. Reduction in NOx formation can be
achieved by lowering the flame temperature to a level below
2200 K. On the other hand, soot formation takes place in regions
Xhaving high equivalence ratio (i.e. fuel-rich mixtures) and mod-
erate temperature. Net soot emission from the engine is a bal-
ance between soot formation and soot oxidation. Therefore, soot
emission can be reduced either by increasing fuel-air mixing or
by increasing soot oxidation rate [10]. NOxD
X and soot emissions
are strong functions of flame temperature and equivalence ratio
hence direct approach for simultaneous reduction of NOx and
soot emission is to control the flame temperature and local
equivalence ratio of charge in the combustion chamber. Main
benefit of HCCI combustion is to concurrently reduce the flame
temperature and allow sufficient fuel-air mixing by increasing
mixture homogeneity of a lean charge [11]. HCCI engine operates
on lean homogeneous mixtures therefore has lower peak cylin-
der temperatures in the combustion chamber, which minimizes
X and particulate simultaneously.

1.2. Advantages of LTC

PThis section describes potential advantages and scientific chal-
lenges in exploiting full spectrum of advantage of this novel LTC con-
cept. LTC offers several advantages over conventional combustion
modes [9,12]:

P(cid:3) LTC employs higher CR (depending on fuel quality) and has
shorter combustion duration. Thus, it approximates a constant
volume combustion and achieves relatively higher thermal effi-
Xthereby lower
ciency due to its lower combustion temperature D
radiation losses. Throttling losses are also absent in LTC engineD
P(cid:3) LTC has potential of significantly lower emissions compared to
compression ignition direct injection (CIDI) and direct injection
spark ignition (DISI) engines and simultaneously reduces NOxD
and PM emissions. There is no flame front i.e. there is complete
absence of localized areas of excessively high temperature and
rich mixtures due to superior homogeneity of fuel-air mixture.
Therefore, there is no soot production in an ideal LTC cycle. Fur-
ther, there are low-temperature conditions and more uniform
distribution of bulk gas temperature in the cylinder; therefore,

Pcannot be used as combustion control parameter during engine
operation because heat transfer is primarily governed by engine
X[20]. Hence all engine perfor-
design and engine operating conditionD
mance parameters are determined by the first three factors. There-
fore, any combustion phasing control method has to affect one or
more of these three factors. All combustion phasing methods
can be divided in two broad categories namely D
Xthose which alterD
(i) temperature-time history of the charge; and (ii) mixture reactiv-
ity. Various strategies proposed by researchers for changing the tem-
perature-time history includes modulating intake air temperature
[3,17(cid:1)19], variable compression ratio (VCR) [20,21], variable EGR
[22], VVT and residual/ exhaust gas trapping [16,22(cid:1)24], in-cylinder
injection timing control [25,26], variable coolant temperature [27]
and water injection [28]. Proposed strategies for changing mixture
reactivity includeD
X modulating two or more fuels [29,30], fuel addi-
tives [31,32] and variable EGR [22]. Despite large number of pro-
posed solutions, each strategy has its own merits and challenges in
implementation in commercial engines [33]. Therefor for LTC con-
trol, additional research is required for development of new algo-
rithms, strategies and methodologies to control the fuel and air
systems by employing close-loop control using cost effective feed-
back sensors. Mostly closed loop control studies are conducted using
cylinder pressure sensors, which are expensive D
Xfor commercial
applications. Advanced control
theory and control arithmetic
using next-generation combustion sensors, and hardware-soft-
ware specialized for LTC needD
X to be developed in order to opti-
Xrange of load-speed combinations of
mize combustion over wide D
the engine.

P(ii) Limited power density
PSimilar to SI or CI engines, LTC engines are also expected to oper-
ate at high loads and speeds. However, LTC engines operate satisfac-
torily from low-to-medium loads only and experience difficulties at
high loads. At highD
Xloads, combustion rate is very high, resulting in
very high rate of pressure rise (RoPR) and as a consequence into
pressure oscillations. ThisD
X leads to unacceptable noise, potential
engine damage, and higher NOx emissions. This also limits the power
output/ density and puts high structural demand on the LTC engines.
Research is therefore required to develop new methodologies and
understanding to slow-down chemical kinetics of fuel-air mixtures.
It would result in longer combustion duration at higher engine loads,
in order to prevent excessive noise and structural damage. To extend
operating range of LTC engines, one strategy is to boost the intake air
either by supercharging [34,35] or by turbocharging [36(cid:1)38].
Another methodology to overcome the lower power density issue of
LTC engines is dual mode operation e.g. SI-HCCI [39,40] and CI-HCCI
[41,42] hybrid combustion modes.

P(iii) High combustion noise, CO and HC emissions
PIn a LTC engine, ignition occurs simultaneously throughout the
combustion chamber. Hence, at higher loads, relatively richer fuel-
air mixtures are used, leading to higher RoPR and high-frequency
noise/ intensive ringing, compared to conventional DICI or DISI
engines [42].

PIn general, LTC engines emit significantly lower NOxD

X and PM
emissions but they emit relatively higher hydrocarbon (HC) and car-
bon monoxide (CO) emissions. In homogeneous combustion, signifi-
cant portion of charge enters the crevices during compression stroke
and escapes during expansion stroke without combustion. More-
over, burnt gas temperature is too low to consume much of this
unburned charge, when it re-enters the cylinder during expansion
stroke. This result in significant increase in HC and CO emissions
compared to conventional combustion modes [12]. In addition, the
peak burnt gas temperatures are too low (lower than 1400 K or
1500 K) to complete CO to carbon dioxide (CO2) oxidation reactions
at low loads therefore the combustion efficiency also deteriorates
[43]. At low engine loads, CO emission can be reduced by applying
direct in-cylinder injection technique however at higher engine

Ploads, after-treatment devices are essential to control HC and CO
emissions [12]. Unfortunately, lower exhaust gas temperature (EGT)
X results in relatively lower effectiveness of after-
of LTC engineD
treatment devices. Therefore, low temperature oxidation catalysts
need to be developed so that future emission standards for HC and
CO can be complied by LTC engines [12].

P(iv) Cold start capability
PIn LTC engines, ignition is extremely sensitive to the intake
charge temperature. Temperature required to achieve auto-ignition
varies according to D
Xtest fuel properties and engine operating condi-
tions. During cold start, lower temperature of the compressed-
charge prevents LTC engine from firing. For improving the cold start
during LTC, several techniques such as use of glow plugs, fuel addi-
tives and increasing the CR using VCR or VVT D
Xwere investigated [12].
XHowever, the most practical approach is the dual mode, in which
the engine is started in SI or CI mode and then switched over to LTC
mode after adequate warm-up.

P(v) Homogeneous mixture preparation
PHomogeneous mixture preparation and avoiding fuel-wall inter-
actions are crucial for achieving high thermal efficiency, reducing
HC and PM emissions, and preventing oil dilution in LTC engine.
This is particularly very important, while using relatively low vola-
tility test fuels such as mineral diesel in LTC [16]. Mixture homoge-
neity significantly affects the auto-ignition reactions, which directly
controls LTC combustion phasing [44]. For homogeneous fuel-air
mixture preparation, fuel could be injected in a highly turbulent
port flow stream in case of gaseous and highly volatile liquid fuel
usage [45,46] and early in-cylinder injection using sophisticated
fuel injectors for mineral diesel like fuels [44].

P(vi) Cyclic and cylinder-to-cylinder variations
PCyclic variations in LTC engines are typically lower compared
to conventional SI engines however these variations can be much
larger under certain operating conditions (e.g. very lean engine
operations,
low intake temperatures) [47,48]. Cyclic variations
directly influence two major aspects of LTC engine i.e. limited low
load boundary (power output) and challenging combustion phas-
ing control. LTC does not have direct control on combustion phas-
ing such as injection timing/ spark timing in case of conventional
CI and SI engines. Due to cycle-to-cycle variations in LTC, combus-
tion timing control challenges become extreme (especially during
transient engine operations) because of no direct control on the
combustion timings [49]. Rapid mode switching between LTC and
conventional combustion (CI/ SI) is a good strategy to extend
engine's operating range [12]. To implement mode switching, con-
trol of combustion phasing is required on cycle-to-cycle basis and
In-cylinder pro-
cyclic variations affect these control methods.
cesses responsible for cyclic variations need to be investigated
thoroughly and controlled for making LTC more stable [50]. Most
LTC experiments have been conducted on single-cylinder engines.
However, when LTC was applied to multi-cylinder engines, the
engine exhibited cylinder-to-cylinder variations as well due to its
Xindividual manifolds. These
structure and different lengths of
small differences causeD
X ignition timings and combustion rates to
vary greatly. Therefore, it is essential to produce suitable intake
and exhaust manifold designs for multi-cylinder engines, which
can overcome the challenge of maintaining strict uniformity in
inlet and exhaust flows for each cylinder.

P(vii) Accurate chemical reaction mechanism and combustion

model development

PDuring R&D, a large number of design options and research
strategies rely on numerical calculations and computational fluid
dynamics (CFD) simulations. To accurately predict specific features
and emissions from LTC engines, it is necessary to develop multi-
dimensional CFD combustion models that can be coupled with
detailed chemical kinetics models to overcome the challenge of
rapidly and inexpensively evaluating combustion system designs.

1.4. Historical evolution of low temperature combustion concepts

PThe idea of LTC has been around for over 100 years [51]. Carl W.
Weiss first patented his invention of a hot-bulb 2-stroke oil engine
in 1897 [52]. In Weiss' engine, kerosene or raw fuel was injected
onto the surface of a hot-bulb to prepare a homogenous vaporized
mixture in a heated pre-chamber. Fuel injection timing was kept
very early in the compression stroke so that plenty of time was avail-
able for fuel vaporization and mixing with air. Prepared homoge-
neous fuel-air mixture was supplied to the engine cylinder, where
the mixture was auto-ignited at the end of the compression strokeD
X.
During start-up, the hot bulb was heated on the outer surface using
Xbulb was maintained
a torch or a burner. Once the engine starts, the D
hot by the burning gas [51]. Russian scientist Nikolai Semenov and
his colleagues established that the first theoretical and practical
exploitation of chemical-kinetics controlled combustion for mineral
diesel engine was done in 19300s [51]. Later in 19700s, Turkish et al.
[53] built the first controlled auto ignition (CAI) engine, in which
combustion was controlled D
Xusing active species, which were dis-
charged from partially burned mixtures in a separate pre-chamber
and the process was called “Avalanche Activated Combustion” (AAC).
PThe most recognized and pioneering systematic early investiga-
tions using compression ignition of homogeneous mixtures are
credited to Onishi [54], who developed active thermoD
X-atmosphericD
combustion (ATAC) concept and Noguchi et al. [55], who developed
Toyota-Soken (TS) combustion concept on two-stroke engines in
late 19700s. The basic idea was to run a 2-stroke engine with lean
fuel-air mixture at part-load. At throttled operation, large quantity
of burnt gas remains trapped in the cylinder during scavenging,
which increases the mean charge temperature to a degree, where
auto-ignition occurs. Onishi also provided an ideal model for ATAC
principle (Fig. 5), which explained basic difference between an ATAC
and SI combustion.

PIn ATAC, fuel was consumed simultaneously at a lower rate and
there was no flame propagation [54]. Noguchi et al. [55] also differ-
entiated the process from classic “run-on” by presenting Schlieren
photography of combustion initiation at multiple sites, away from
the cylinder walls [55]. They referred LTC as a combination of pri-
mary low temperature reactions and secondary combustion reac-
Xs and identified the role of radicals from previous combustion
tionD
cycles in controlling the onset of first stage reactions.
It was
observed that
(HO2), and
atomic oxygen (O) radicals were present and behaved as ignition
kernels for initial stage of TS combustion. Upon formation of signifi-
cant number of hydroxyl (OH) D
Xradicals, combustion reactions com-
menced [55]. In both cases (ATAC and TS), significant fuel savings
were realized, along with mitigation of cycle-to-cycle variability,
which is normally present in 2-stroke SI engines. Several detailed
studies of ATAC combustion followed shortly after Onishi's first pub-
X[57(cid:1)62]. After the pioneering research by Onishi and Nogu-
licationD

chi, R&D on 2-stroke gasoline engines culminated inD

Xomogeneous D

PLTC was first investigated in a 4-stroke engine and named
“CD
XCharge” (CIHC) by Najt and
Xompression ID
Foster [65]. They reiterated that there was lack of a flame front in
CIHC engine and further elaborated on the nature of 2-stage com-
bustion reactions. Similar to Onishi and Noguchi, they also observed
low cyclic variability in 4-stroke engine operations. Thring intro-
duced a new terminology “homogeneous charge compression igni-
tion” (HCCI) in his research paper investigating the effect of external
EGR and air-fuel ratio on HCCI combustion [66]. Since 1990'D
Xs, HCCI
concept has grown as an attractive research topic worldwide in the
engine community due to prevailing highD
X fuel prices and stringent
emission regulations worldwide [67(cid:1)69]. First time, Stockinger
et al. [70] showed a four-cylinder gasoline engine operated D
Xby auto-
ignition in a very limited speed and load range, by employing higher
CRs and preheating of intake air. Olsson et al. [71] demonstrated
heavy-duty gasoline engine (12-litre six-cylinder) with auto-ignition
combustion in late 19900s. By employing various combinations of
isooctane and heptane through a closed loop control, turbocharging,
high CR, and intake air heating, they achieved auto-ignition over a
wide speed and load range.

XNumerous research studies spread over several decades demon-
strated the feasibility and potential of CAI in 4-stroke gasoline
engines however they failed to represent a practical implementation
of auto-ignition combustion concept in a production grade engine.
In order to develop a production viable gasoline auto-ignition com-
bustion engine for vehicular applications, it was necessary to operate
the engine without external charge heating or with extremely high
CRs, or on special fuel blends [51]. Over the last few decades of LTC
research, LTC has been referred to by different names such as Active
Thermo-Atmosphere Combustion (ATAC) [54], Activated Radical
(AR) combustion [63,64], Toyota Soken (TS) Combustion [55], Com-
pression-Ignited Homogeneous Charge (CIHC) Combustion [65],

1.5. Different variations of LTC

Xinjection of fuel in order to achieve a chemically and physically
homogeneous fuel-air mixture before auto-ignition. LTC cycle was

Ptemperature and EGR. Second issue was related to very high intake
air temperature (135 °C-205 °C) to reduce the accumulation of liquid
fuel droplets on the intake manifold surfaces. Third issue was rela-
tively higher unburned HC emissions due to lower CRs, inferior com-
bustion and non-optimal combustion phasing. Control over mineral
diesel fueled HCCI combustion timings and HRR were another main
challenges. Problems associated with design and operational param-
eters related to mineral diesel HCCI were evaluated by Gan et al.
[85]. They reviewed mineral diesel HCCI technology and discussed
various control and performance parameters, which affect HCCI
combustion. They concluded that for long-term development of
mineral diesel HCCI combustion systems and superior mixture for-
mation and control, flexible fuel injection strategies and use of EGR
will be the most critical control approaches. Lu et al. [86] used EGR
and evaluated the effect of EGR on important combustion character-
istics. They reported that combustion phasing retarded with increas-
ing EGR, which resulted in relatively longer combustion duration.
This aspect was further investigated by Nakano et al. [87] using
model analysis. They simulated an EGR controlled HCCI system and
showed excellent control capabilities of EGR. Komninos [88] and
Kamninos and Kosmadakis [89] also performed a multi-zone model
analysis based on heat and mass transfer in HCCI combustion sys-
tem. The multi-zone model included sub-models for heat transfer
between different zones and to the cylinder wall and mass transfer
between hotter and colder regions of the combustion chamber.

PNissan Motor Co. developed the most successful commercial con-
cept, quite close to HCCI called MK system for a 4-stroke direct injec-
tion diesel engine using high CRs [80]. In this combustion concept,
injection timing was retarded and by using EGR, ignition delay (ID)
was D
Xincreased. This means that there should be longer time available
for fuel vaporization and charge mixing. In combination with high
swirl gas motion, premixed combustion phase increased. EGR and
late ignition timings reduced the NOxD
Xformation and soot was sup-
pressed by the high fraction of premixed combustion. In last few
years, approaches such as residual gas trapping and exhaust gas
rebreathing [90] for initiating and controlling CAI have gained popu-
larity, since they appear to offer the best chances of incorporating
CAI combustion in a production grade gasoline engine in short-to-
medium term, and require no radical (expensive) changes to vehicle
or engine architecture [51]. To control HC and CO emissions from
HCCI engine, double fuel injection strategy was used by Canakci and
Reitz [91]. They developed a micro-genetic algorithm based on
intake air temperature, start of injection (SoI) timings, and split
injection parameters for HCCI combustion optimization.

P1.5.2. Premixed charge compression ignition (PCCI)

PTo achieve LTC, light-duty diesel engines were operated in PCCI
mode. PCCI is a promising combustion technique that simulta-
neously reduces both NOxD
X and PM emissions. PCCI combustion can
be achieved by increasing EGR rate, advancing SoI timings, and
increasing FIP. These modifications lead to a more homogeneous
combustion flame in the engine cylinder as opposed to a stratified
flame that occurs along the fuel spray during conventional mineral
diesel combustion [92]. In PCCI combustion, emissions from the
engine reduce drastically due to homogeneous fuel-air mixture com-
bustion. Despite a lot of research related to PCCI combustion, there
are still some aspects, which are not completely D
Xunderstood. Higher
CO and HC emissions along with problems related to high engine
loads are some of these issues, which are yet to be resolved.

PKimura et al. [80] suggested that PCCI combustion is a single-
stage combustion process, similar to premixed phase of conven-
tional diesel combustion however in HCCI combustion, two different
combustion regions of low and high temperature oxidation can be
seen. Compared to HCCI combustion, PCCI combustion results in rel-
X and soot emissions, however PCCI combustion
atively higher NOxD
offers significantly lower HC and CO emissions compared to HCCI

Phas been modified with time and several new concepts and strate-
gies similar to LTC have emerged. Difference between different LTC
derivatives has been shown in Fig. 6 [82].

PHCCI combustion is an ideal LTC concept, in which homogeneous
fuel-air mixture is supplied to the combustion chamber however in
other derivatives of LTC such as PCCI or PPC, fuel-air mixture is not
homogeneous. In partially premixed combustion (PPC), fuel is injected
closer to TDC and combustion is controlled by EGR. In PCCI combus-
tion, fuel injection takes place early in the compression stroke, which
leads to premixed fuel-air mixture formation. PPC is therefore an
intermediate technique between PCCI and CI combustion. HECC is
another derivative of LTC in which high EGR reduces NOxD
X emissions
and the use of after-treatment devices controls the D

Xemissions.

P1.5.1. Homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI)

PHCCI combustion concept is the most ideal form of LTC in which
homogeneous fuel-air mixture auto-ignites and results in lower NOxD
and soot emissions. HCCI combustion using mineral diesel was
explored by researchers after achieving gasoline fueled LTC, due to
X and PM [29,34,44].
its potential for simultaneous reduction of NOxD
Khandal et al. [83] presented D
Xa road map of HCCI technology devel-
opment. They showed importance of HCCI combustion by comparing
it with advanced CI engine technologies. Several research groups
started experimental exploration of mineral diesel HCCI in mid-
1990's. For diesel fueled HCCI, main challenge was preparation of
homogeneous fuel-air mixture since mineral diesel hasD
X extremely
low volatility [41]. To resolve this issue, elevated air temperature
was used to vaporize mineral diesel so that premixed homogeneous
charge can be formed however significant cool combustion chemis-
try of mineral diesel limited use of this technique [67]. During the
compression stroke, when the temperature of diesel-air mixture
exceeded 800 K, rapid auto-ignition inside the combustion chamber
causesD
X excessive knocking. Therefore, in-cylinder mixture prepara-
tion using early direct injection and late direct injection were
employed for achieving mineral diesel HCCI however poor fuel-air
mixing from these techniques resulted in relatively inferior combus-
tion. For diesel, port fuel injection was found to be the most straight
forward approach to obtain a premixed charge. It was an external
mixture preparation approach, which was based on fumigation of
mineral diesel at elevated temperatures [7]. In this technique, turbu-
lent flow velocities at intake port promoted fuel-air mixing and
resulted in formation of more homogenous charge. Ryan and Calla-
han [67] used port fuel injection for homogeneous charge prepara-
tion. In this technique, an intake air heater was installed upstream of
fuel injector to D
Xvaporize the fuel. In a similar study carried out by
Gray and Ryan [84], three key issues were reported for mineral die-
sel-fueled HCCI. First issue was very premature ignition and knock-
ing at high CRs. Therefore, a suitable range of CR (8 to 13) was
recommended, which can be varied depending on intake air

Pcombustion. Cao et al. [93] evaluated PCCI combustion using experi-
ments and computational modelsD
X and explored the effect of fuel
injection timings on fuel-air mixing and emissions. They observed
fuelD
X-rich pockets with late injection timings and reported that these
fuel- rich pockets are useful for triggering auto-ignition and advanc-
ing the combustion phasing. Parks et al. [94] used a light-duty diesel
engine (4-cylinder, 1.7-l Mercedes) for investigating PCCI combus-
Xand PM emissions but
tion. Experimental results showed lower NOxD
relatively higher CO and HC emissions in PCCI combustion. For better
understanding of PCCI combustion, Benajes et al. [95] carried out
experimental and D
Xsimulation studies to explain mixing and auto-
ignition processes in PCCI combustion. They used a high speed direct
injection (HSDI) diesel engine with variable EGR, SoI timings, and
fuels (diesel and gasoline). Results showed that addition of gasoline
had highest impact on fuel-air mixing and auto-ignition compared
to any other variable. They also reported that D
XID could be increased
by advancing SoI timing, together with high EGR. Both these
extended the time available for fuel-air mixing i.e. the time interval
between end of injection (EoI) and SoC. To solve the basic problem
of PCCI combustion i.e. high CO and HC emissions, Parks et al. [94]
performed PCCI experiments using after-treatment devices. Three
Xtrap (LNT), diesel oxidation
different technologies namely lean NOxD
catalyst (DOC), and diesel particulate filter (DPF) were investigated
for PCCI combustion. LNT was studied at various engine loads and
speeds while the engine was operated in PCCI and CI combustion
modes. DOC/ DPF were investigated to determine their effectiveness
in controlling CO and HC emissions from PCCI engine. LNT worked
better with PCCI combustion because lower NOxD
X emissions were
further reduced by the catalyst. DOC was particularly effective in
oxidizing higher formaldehyde and acetaldehyde emissions from
PCCI combustion. Due to lower soot formation, DPFs also benefitted
from PCCI combustion because of reduced soot removal require-
ment. PM from PCCI combustion was observed to be significantly
smaller in size but had higher organic solubility. Laguitton et al.
[96] studied the impact of low CR on PCCI combustion under differ-
ent part load conditions. The results showed that reduction in CR
offered similar benefits as retarded fuel injection timings, but noise
increased due to combined premixed and diffusion combustion.
Araki et al. [97] also studied the effects of CR on mineral diesel
fueled PCCI combustion in order to overcome the issues of knocking
under high load conditions and cyclic variations under low-load
conditions. They suggested that the operating range of PCCI engine
could be extended from low loads to high loads by reducing the CR.
However, reduction in CR resulted in relatively higher CO emission
due to D
Xrelatively inferior combustion efficiency. Several researchers
proposed wall wetting as the main source of higher HC emissions
from PCCI engines [80,93]. To investigate this, PCCI experiments
were performed using narrow cone angle injectors. Kim and Lee
[98] also investigated the effect of narrow fuel spray angle injection
and dual injection strategy on the exhaust emissions D
Xfrom a com-
mon-rail diesel engine operating in LTC mode. For achieving LTC,
early fuel injection from a narrow cone angle injector was used

advanced first injection for PCCI combustion and a retarded second
injection.

PKanda et al. [99] used a conventional wide angle injector to inject
the fuel very close to TDC in a re-entrant type combustion chamber
and compared the results with PCCI combustion in shallow dish type
combustion chamber using NADI. In these studies, they found lower
Xemissions by using NADI. However, the problem of fuel adher-
NOxD
ing (spray impingement D
Xon piston bowl) to the surface of piston
bowl resulted in relatively higher HC and CO emissions and limitedD
the use of this technique. However, with wide angle injectors and
injection timing set close to TDC, they were able to alleviate this

Pissue and attained lower emissions along with improved combustion
stability (Fig. 8).

XFig. 9.

PMurata et al. [100] analyzed the effect of variations in valve tim-
Xemissions. They used late IVC to reduce the temperature
ings on NOxD
inside the combustion chamber, which in-turn increased the D
XID and
provided more time for pre-mixing of fuel and air. Combined effect
of pre-mixing and lower in-cylinder temperature resulted in lower
soot and NOxD
X emissions. Jia et al. [101,102] performed a 3-dimen-
sional full engine cycle CFD simulation to analyze the effect of IVC
and SoI timing on performance and emissions from PCCI combus-
tion. They controlled ignition timings by controlling IVC timings and
SoI timings. They suggested that late IVC coupled with optimized SoI
resulted in significantly lower NOxD
Xemissions. However, too early SoI
led to wall wetting issues and retarded SoI resulted in improper mix-
Xsignificantly higher CO and HC emissions D
ing leading toD
PSu and Yu [103] investigated the effect of different control
parameters such as boost pressure, EGR etc. on engine's thermal effi-
Xemissions. They observed that gross indicated thermal
ciency and D
efficiency (ITE) increased with increasing D
Xboost pressure. In addition
to experiments, various mathematical models were developed to
depict the effect of injection parameters on LTC. An extension of pre-
viously stated work of Jia et al. [101] was D
Xperformed by Alstine et al.
[104]. They developed a simple, control oriented analytical model,
which enabled them to predict SoC timings for PCCI engine with
advanced fuel injection system. Desantes et al. [105] developed
chemical kinetics software to simulate standard mineral diesel as
well as low temperature D
Xcombustion. They predicted thermal NOxD
Xby considering inputs such as reaction tem-
formation in the engine D
perature (both initial and final), mixture fraction and oxygen mass
fraction etc. Detailed study of injection parameters, effect of EGR
and fuel spray impingement on emission characteristics was per-
formed by Kiplimo et al. [106]. They suggested that an increase
in fuel injection pressure (FIP) resulted in lower HC, PM and NOxD
emissions. However, CO emissions did not show D
Xsignificant varia-
tions with changing FIP. Ogawa et al. [107] studied the effect of fuel
injection parameters on thermal efficiency of PCCI diesel engines.
They found relatively higher (»3%) variations in indicated mean

PIn CI engines, intermediate HCCI concept is known as partially
premixed combustion (PPC). When operating an engine in PPC
mode, D
XID leads to greater degree
of premixed charge, which shifts emission characteristics closer to
HCCI than a CI engine [108]. EGR can be used to reduce the tempera-
ture of the charge. When fuel is injected closer to TDC, lower tem-
perature and higher specific heat of the gas causes an increase in D

This leads to reduced NOxD
reduction in combustion efficiency, and higher emissions of UHC
and CO. Compared to HCCI, PPC offers better control over combus-
tion since combustion phasing is controlled by the SoI timing D
[108,109]. Fridriksson et al. [110] investigated PPC combustion
experimentally and carried out a CFD analysis for its performance
and emission characterization. A commercial CFD code AVL FIRE was
used for evaluation of engine performance and emissions for differ-
ent percentage of heat rejection. Engine performance was measured

(PPCI) mode of combustion using blends of gasoline and mineral
diesel (dieseline). PPCI combustion was achieved using different
XEGR rates. Dieseline fueled PPCI

for determining the operating region of single injection PPC for
Xiesel, low octane gasoline with similar charac-
three different fuels; dD
teristics as diesel, and higher octane standard gasoline. High octane
fuel was found to be superior D
Xfor PPC combustion because it gave
longer IDD

PPC significantly.

P1.5.4. Reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI)

PAfter D

Xextensive research on LTC, researchers D

Xdemonstrated an
advanced LTC technique namely reactivity controlled compression
ignition (RCCI) combustion, which seems to be more promising com-
pared to HCCI and PPC. In RCCI combustion, high-reactivity fuels
such as diesel, dimethyl ether (DME), etc. are used to control the
ignition and combustion of low-reactivity fuels such as gasoline, eth-
anol, methanol, butanol, etc. RCCI combustion can be considered as a
PPC strategy based on dual-fuel operation. To achieve RCCI combus-
X, and
tion, high-reactivity fuel is directly injected into the cylinderD

Plow-reactivity fuel is supplied to the intake manifold [114,115]. RCCI
combustion results in relatively higher brake thermal efficiency
(BTE) compared to HCCI combustion and other derivatives of LTC,
while maintaining relatively lower NOxD

Xand PM emissions [116].

PFor improving RCCI combustion, researchers investigated differ-
ent parameters including EGR levels, swirl intensity levels of intake
charge, FIP, SoI timings and number of injections for both DI injec-
tors and PFI injectors. Walker et al. [117] investigated the effect of
direct FIPD
Xon RCCI and reported that combustion phasing was signifi-
cantly affected by FIP of the primary fuel. Hanson and Reitz [118]
carried out RCCI experiments using mineral diesel as the primary
fuel and gasoline as the secondary fuel. During transient conditions,
they observed that approximately 80 cycles were required to
achieve steady load conditions in RCCI combustion. Curran et al.
[119] also carried out similar experiments using diesel/ gasoline
combination to achieve RCCI combustion and reported that NOxD
Xand
PM emissions decreased by more than 90%. Ma et al. [120] investi-
gated the effect of SoI timings on gasoline (port)(cid:1)diesel (in-cylinder)
dual-fuel RCCI engine performance and emission characteristics and
reported that early pilot injection timings resulted in improved ISFC
with significantly lower NOxD

Xand soot emissions.

PSeveral

researchers have proposed that RCCI combustion
can be easily achieved by using alternative fuels. Various low reac-
tivity fuels, including natural gas [121(cid:1)125], methanol/ ethanol
[114,126(cid:1)131] and butanol [132(cid:1)136], have been studied to explore
their effects on load extension in RCCI combustion. D
XA common con-
clusion is that stable and extended RCCI operation can be achieved
with these low reactivity alternative fuels. Alcohols have shown
Xgood prospects for application in RCCI because of their higher latent
heat of vaporization and lower reactivity. Park et al. [137] compared
the effect of secondary fuel on RCCI combustion and reported that
port injection of bioethanol led to longer IDD
X compared to gasoline,
which resulted in higher IMEP. They also reported that increasing
premixed ratio (rp) for bioethanol caused greater increase in HC and
CO emissions compared to gasoline. Hanson et al. [138] investigated
RCCI combustion on a light-duty, multi-cylinder diesel engine fueled
by E20 (20% ethanol blended with mineral diesel) as secondary fuel.
They reported that ethanol developed an increased reactivity gradi-
ent due to its relatively lower reactivity compared to gasoline, which
led to lower RoPR. Due to lower auto-ignition tendency of ethanol,
E20 resulted in a relatively higher peak load compared to gasoline.
Splitter et al. [139] performed RCCI experiments using E85-diesel
blend and reported »56% gross ITE. Park and Yoon [140] investigated
the performance and emission characteristics of RCCI combustion
using diesel-biogas and diesel-gasoline combinations. They reported
that IMEP increased upon increasing rp with very early in-cylinder
injection timing. Increasing rp resulted in a longer IDD
X, which led to
retarded combustion phasing (CA50). This resulted in ultra-low NOxD
and soot emissions as well as the reduced total particle number

PRCCI combustion fueled by diesel/ CNG dual fuel. They reported that
up to medium engine loads, RCCI combustion could be achieved
without EGR, which resulted in higher thermal efficiency however
exhaust emissions did not increase significantly. Kokjohn and Reitz
[142] carried out a CFD study to investigate the effect of rp on com-
bustion characteristics of RCCI combustion and reported that rp can
be varied in between 0.75 and 0.85 to avoid the excessive RoPR and
combustion stability. At rp higher than 0.86, BTE decreased signifi-
cantly due to inferior combustion and at rp less than 0.75, higher
RoPR resulted in excessive noise.

PAlthough RCCI has shown advantages compared to other com-
bustion concepts, there are D
Xobstacles that need to be resolved. One
of the major issues is high load extension, which is mainly restricted
by either an excessive RoPR or by NOxD
X/ soot emissions. Increasing rp
Xcould resolve this issue partly however too high rp resulted in gaso-
line-like HCCI combustion but was restricted by higher RoPR
[120,139,143(cid:1)147]. Several researchers proposed that RCCI opera-
tion D
Xcould be extended by enhancing the in-cylinder mixture stratifi-
cation, which can be achieved by injection strategy and system
optimization. Lim and Reitz [148] utilized a second gasoline DI injec-
tor in addition to D
Xduce stronger mix-
Xmineral diesel DI injector to inD
ture stratification, in order to extend the upper load limit.

P1.5.5. High efficiency clean combustion (HECC)

PHigh efficiency clean combustion (HECC) is another new modi-
fied methodology for LTCD
X. Park and Reitz [149] reported that HECC
results in high combustion efficiency (» 100%) and near zero NOxD
and soot emissions. They varied equivalence ratio, inlet temperature,
IVC timing, engine speed and fuel quantity with an assumption of
ideal homogeneous charge. They identified low emission regions in
an equivalence ratio-peak cycle temperature map (Fig. 10). They
reported that the low emission region was on the relatively leaner
side of the stoichiometric equivalence ratio, when combustion tem-
perature generated by charge was in range of 1500(cid:1)2000 K. In this
range, lower temperature limit ensured complete oxidation of CO
into CO2D
X and the upper temperature limit ensured minimum NOxD
formation. They suggested that low emissions could also be achieved
at reduced EGR levels by retarding the IVC timing, and the low emis-
sion window moved towards higher temperatures as engine speed
Xincreased.

PFig. 11(a) shows the potential of LTC to replace conventional CI
combustion using two specific forms of LTC namely high-dilution
combustion (HDC) and HECC [150,151]. HDC is typically achieved by
using a high level of EGR to delay ignition and allowD
Xmore time for
fuel(cid:1)air mixing prior to combustion. Sluder and Wagner [150]
reported that HECC can be achieved by using a combination of high
EGR and modified fuel injection strategy. They investigated this

Pemissions. Qian et al. [132] carried out RCCI combustion investiga-
tions in a single-cylinder engine to investigate the performance and
emission characteristics of RCCI combustion. They used n-heptane
as primary fuel combined with ethanol, n-butanol and n-amyl alco-
hol as secondary fuels. They found that soot emissions decreased sig-
nificantly with increasing rp at constant overall lower heating value
X emissions first increased and then
(LHV) per cycle, however NOxD
decreased. At a constant rp, increasing overall LHVD
Xper-cycle resulted
in higher NOxD
X and soot emissions. Combustion characteristics of
XID of ethanol RCCI was
different secondary fuels showed that the D
slightly longer compared to n-butanol and n-amyl alcohol. This was
mainly due to the retarded combustion phasing of ethanol at higher
rp. These results indicated that alcohols have a great potential D
Xto be
utilized in RCCI combustion due to their higher latent heat of vapori-
zation and higher molecular oxygen. Isik and Aydin [141] carried out
RCCI combustion experimentD
X in a constant speed engine using
blends of mineral diesel and biodiesel as primary fuel (high reactiv-
ity fuel) and ethanol as secondary fuel (low reactivity fuel). They
reported that addition of ethanol improved the engine combustion
characteristics and resulted in significantly lower NOxD
Xemissions at
Xthe cost of slightly higher HC and CO emissions.

PSeveral researchers carried out computational investigations to
explore the RCCI combustion characteristics using different numeri-
cal methods. Nieman et al. [121] used the CFD software KIVA3V and
the chemical kinetics analysis tools of CHEMKIN to investigate the

Pnovel concept with a modified Mercedes 1.7-liter direct-injection,
common-rail diesel engine. They modified high pressure EGR system
and connected an EGR cooler and a catalyzed diesel particulate filter
(CDPF) in the EGR loop. Using this modified system, they observed a
significant reduction in NOxD
X and PM mass emissions however CO,
HC, and HCHO emissions increased significantly (Fig. 11(b)), which
reinforcesD
Xneed of using after-treatment devices to control
Xemissions. Comparison of performance results showed that engine
BTE in HECC combustion mode was equivalent to that of baseline
engine with CR of 19.5.

X the D

PWagner et al. [151] suggested two strategies for simultaneous
reduction of NOxD
X and PM emissions under lean conditions. These
strategies were implemented at different engine loads, ranging from
low to moderate loads. The first strategy was based on EGR rate, in
which, they tested maximum EGR rate for each load condition. The
second strategy was based on combination of EGR and injection
parameters. They implemented both strategies and observed a sig-
nificant reduction in total particle number concentration and
Xparticulate size, which eventually reduced total PM mass. This
reduction in PM mass was associated with a small fuel penalty due
X to investigate
to high EGR. Parks et al. [94] carried out experimentD
Xtrap cat-
emission characteristics of HECC system with different NOxD
alysts. In the experimentD
Xwas observed from the com-
bination of HECC combustion and LNT after-treatment at low
temperatureD
X conditions. They also reported that CO and HC emis-
sions from HECC were controlled by LNT at higher temperature how-
ever LNT failed to do so at lower temperature. Gao et al. [108]
simulated NOxD
X and PM generation in HECC system using two-zone
phenomenological model to improve fuel economy and emission
reduction. They also calibrated global reaction mechanism with
experimental pressure measurements and obtained corresponding
predictions for the trajectories in equivalence ratio, temperature,
and oxygen coordinates.

P1.5.6. Spark assisted LTC

PThere are several technical challenges associated with LTC and the
Xdifficult one among them. Applicability
control over SoC is the most D
window of LTC is another challenge which is severely limited by
high combustion rates at higher loads and misfire at lower loads. The
load range can be extended when the in-cylinder temperature is too
low to maintain a reasonable combustion phasing with use of some
advanced techniques such as spark ignition or laser plasma ignition.
Spark assistance is one of the ways of increasing the temperature of
the charge during engine operating conditions that normally results
in partial or total misfire. Combustion phasing is influenced by the
Xhence the combustion
total fuel quantity supplied to the engine D
phasing is affected by load variations. Due to charge dilution by
residual gases, flame propagation becomes slower than D
Xconventional
SI engine. However, the flame propagation increases temperature
and pressure of unburned gas which improves conditions for auto-
ignition, resulting in advanced HCCI combustion phasing. Thus apply-
ing spark ignition to CAI combustion at low loads, combustion phas-
ing can be advanced with resulting increase in efficiency, or even
prevention of misfire. This concept is called spark assisted compres-
sion ignition (SACI). In SACI concept, the discharge of a spark fired
such as in an SI engine creates a flame front, which propagates
throughD
Xthe combustion chamber. The SACI has been widely used to
expand the high load limit of LTC. Xie et al. [152] performed experi-
mentD
Xusing this concept and found that the load of SACI combustion
can be controlled by positive valve overlap (PVO) and external
exhaust gas recirculation (eEGR). SACI combustion was found to be
significantly affected by combustion timing under stoichiometric
conditions. Within the acceptable combustion stability range, small
PVO combined with high eEGR gives better fuel economy at constant
load conditions. The experiments also revealed the fact that using
optimized PVO strategy, stable SACI combustion is achieved in a

Pwider load range, with significant improvementD
Xin fuel economy,
X emissions. According to Wang et al. [153]
pumping loss and NOxD
Xin
SACI combustion mode can be applied in medium-high load region D
high efficiency gasoline engines. In the experiments, they found that
SACI is a combustion mode combining partly flame propagation and
mainly auto-ignition. SACI has combustion characteristics comprising
of two-stage heat release and lower pressure rise rate. Hyv€onen et al.
[154] used a modified VCR engine for investigating spark assisted
HCCI combustion and compared it with baseline HCCI combustion.
Combustion phasing was controlled by varying the CR. They mainly
emphasized on intermediate engine cycles during mode switching,
and experienced higher fluctuations in lean combustion mode.
Higher intake air temperature increased coefficient of variation
(COV) for intermediate cycles. Lower CR was reported to be the main
reason for ultra-low NOxD
X and PM emissions from mineral diesel
fueled HCCI combustion. Zigler et al. [155] focused on describing and
explaining the spark-assisted homogeneous charge compression
ignition phenomena in a single-cylinder research engine and also on
understanding the role and effects of engine load on performance of
SACI combustion mode. The ignition system was successful in reduc-
ing NOxD
Xand PM emissions simultaneously; however the issue of per-
sistent spark plug fouling due to short-circuiting caused by injected
liquid fuel could not be resolved. This behavior of fuel (mineral die-
sel) was due to its very low volatility which required high latent
heat to be available for complete evaporation of fuel spray droplets.
Insufficient latent heat was available in the combustion chamber
due to lower CR of the engine, which was unable to evaporate diesel
droplets at the time of spark and presence of liquid diesel D
Xfilm on
the spark plug at the time of high voltage spark led to its short-
circuiting. Enright et al. [156] optimized spark timings for both
2-stroke and 4-stroke engines for direct injection of diesel.

PPersson et al. [157,158] investigated influence of D

Xspark in a single
cylinder engine with optical access. They monitored the combustion
by in-cylinder pressure data and captured the high speed chemilu-
minescence images. They also explored the effect of negative valve
overlap (NVO) under different experimental conditions. Large NVO
and thus application of high residual fractions showed growing SI
flame that interacted and governed subsequent HCCI combustion.
Hyvonen [154] reported SACI combustion as a combination of SI and
HCCI combustion, in which initial slow heat release (ISHR) repre-
sented quantitative measure of SI combustion fraction. The HRR was
slow during initial flame propagation and relatively faster during
auto ignition in SACI combustion. Therefore iD
Xt was possible to
estimate how much of heat release was due to flame propagation.
Mathematically they formulated this term as:

ISHR D Qthreshold
Q max

¢ 1001⁄2%(cid:4)

Where Qthreshold was the breakpoint, where the combustion changed
from flame propagation to auto ignition and Qmax was the maximum
accumulated heat released in the cycle. An accumulated heat release
trace for a spark assisted HCCI cycle can be seen in Fig. 12, where the
difference between slow and fast heat release is clearly visualized.

PIn these two cases, a flame front develops from the ignition
source, which causes a temperature increase in D
Xyet unburned gas,
which eventually ignites at several locations simultaneously, and
HCCI combustion starts. Advancement in combustion phasing can
thus be achieved with D
Ximproved efficiency and decreased cyclic var-
iations. Dahms et al. [159] investigated characteristics of spark
assisted HCCI system and analyzed combustion process by modeling
X. They also reported mixed mode combustion
as well as experimentD
similar to Hyvonen [154].

PBunting [160] also performed spark assisted HCCI experimentD

combustion chamber since it is just an issue of optical arrangement.
High laser pulse energy resultsD
X in plasma formation with signifi-
cantly higher temperature and pressure compared to plasma forma-
tion during the electrical spark ignition. Researchers have also
Xin relatively lower EGT compared
reported that laser ignition resultsD
XSI engines [163]. This was mainly because laser ignition can ignite
to D
Xleading to lower peak in-cylinder
relatively leaner fuel-air mixtures, D
temperature, hence lower EGT, and NOxD
X formation, which strongly
depends of peak in-cylinder temperature. Therefore lower EGR is
sufficient in case of laser assisted HCCI in order to control NOxD
Xemis-
sions. Laser ignition is also known to be appropriate, when ignition
at high pressure is needed, since the plasma will ignite more of the
charge enclosed in a reference volume due to its higher energy den-
sity. Under these circumstances, the spark from a spark plug can be
quenched due to high pressure. The downside D

cost. The spark plug is cheap and reliable while the laser components
are costly and optical access into the engine is difficult [164]. Laser
assisted LTC concept is based on the fact that most LTC engines are
operated with high EGR rates in order to slow-down rapid combus-
tion (auto-ignition), which gets completed within few CAD closer to
the TDC D
Xtowards the end of the compression stroke/ early expansion
stroke. Kopecek et al. [165] investigated laser HCCI and generated
plasma to assist HCCI combustion thereby gaining some control over
the HCCI combustion. It was also reported that laser plasma could
sustain HCCI combustion even at much lower inlet air temperature
(Ti), compared to normal HCCI operation [165].

engine performance was observed due to large cyclic variations in

gated a novel system to control the SoC using laser ignition. Auto-

ignition conditions were locally attained in aD
bustion chamber under simulated EGR conditions and laser pulse
was used as a source of energy for ignition. They found that number
of
laser pulses required for ignition of combustible mixture

Xreported improved combustion, performance and emission charac-
teristics with higher motor octane number (MON) fuels. To investi-
gate combustion stability, Daw et al. [161] and Glewena et al. [162]
performed spark assisted HCCI experiments and analyzed cyclic var-
iability. They reported that without a spark-induced primary com-
bustion process, the auto-ignition timing significantly retarded

Xled to reduced

P1.5.7. Laser assisted LTC

PAn alternative to spark ignition is laser ignition, where a laser can
be used to ignite the charge and initiate flame propagation instead
of a spark plug. A short laser pulse is focused in a small volume of
fuel-air mixture, which results in a non-resonant breakdown of the
gas, similar to the one resulting from an electrical spark discharge, in
the focal region, followed by formation of hot & dense plasma [163].
After a short D
XID, flame propagates through the combustion chamber
like in a SI engine. In SI engines, cycle-to-cycle variations occur due
to heat loss to the spark plug electrodes, which make the ignitability
of charge in the electrode gap sensitive to local air/ fuel equivalence
ratio. This is not the case for laser ignition, where the plasma is
located well inside the charge, since no heat losses occur to the

2. Homogeneous charge preparation for LTC

PCharge preparation i.e. mixing of fuel and air is a very important
feature of IC engines. The combustion process and its control are
Xdependent on quality of mixture and the technique employed for
charge preparation. One of the major challenges of LTC is to prepare
the premixed charge (highly diluted fuel-air mixture to give reason-
able burn rates) before auto-ignition temperature is attained and
combustion starts in the combustion chamber. In LTC engine, effec-
tive mixture preparation technique is required for achieving high
efficiency, low HC and PM emissions, and preventing lubricating oil
dilution. There are several techniques employed for charge prepara-
tion in LTC engines, depending on test fuel properties and control
strategies being used. In LTC engines, charge preparation techniques
can be divided into three main categories including external charge
preparation using port fuel injection (PFI), internal charge prepara-
tion (using in-cylinder direct injection) and concepts using both
Xcharge preparation techniques (dual-fuel mode). These strategies

Pdiffer from each other in terms of time available for fuel-air mixing
and in degree of mixture homogeneity, which is achieved at the
time of SoC [169].

Pstudies utilized high pressure fuel injectors such as GDI injectors
operating at 5 MPa FIP [176,177], pintle nozzle injectors operating at
12 MPa FIP [178] etc. to prepare the homogenous charge.

2.1. External charge preparation

PExternal charge preparation is one of the first concepts used for
achieving LTC. External charge preparation was done in two ways
namely; (i) port fuel injections, and (ii) using external mixing device.
Both techniques are elaborated in the following sub-sections.

the intake flow further D
X [170].
PFI system is a cheap and simple method for generating homoge-
neous fuel-air mixture [171]. This method delivers superior homoge-
nized fuel-air mixture compared to any other alternativeD
X, since more
time is available for mixture preparation [172]. Fuel is injected very
early in the intake manifold and mixture homogenization takes
place much before the start of auto-ignition, therefore fuel injection
timing cannot be used to control the combustion phasing. This
method is quite suitable for inducting gaseous and highly volatiliteD
liquid fuels such as gasoline. However, in case of low volatility fuels
such as mineral diesel, D
XPFI results in poor fuel evaporation, inhomo-
geneous mixture formation as well as increased wall impingement
of the fuel spray droplets, leading to high HC and CO emissions,
higher fuel consumption and lubricating oil dilution [84,170,173].
PFI can possibly achieve lowest NOx and PM emissions by producing
most homogeneous fuel-air mixtures. However, PFI engines may
produce relatively higher HC and CO emissions. Port injected gaso-
line HCCI has limitations at very low loads, when the combustion
temperature falls under a critical value (1400(cid:1)1500 K) and large
amount of HC and CO are formed, which reduce the combustion effi-
ciency [174]. Another drawback in PFI system is due to the wall film
Xthe intake manifold, which reacts rather slowly to engine
formed inD
transients and could possibly obstruct the combustion control, when
VVT is used [49]. Several studies of HCCI combustion using gasoline
or gasoline like fuels have been conducted using PFID
X. Generally, an
electronically controlled solenoid gasoline injector was used, and in
some cases, two injectors injecting two different fuels were used
[69,175]. Some initial experiments also explored using port injection
of mineral diesel using PFI system [67,69]. Higher boiling range of
mineral diesel resulted in poor evaporation of the fuel and non-
evaporated fuel adhered to the intake system and the combustion
chamber walls. Raising the air intake temperature reduced the fuel
wall-film in the intake system and reducedD

emissions; however, they still remained on the higher side [69].
Increased intake air temperature however advanced the combustion
timing and reduced the power density of HCCI engine further. Some

P2.1.2. External charge preparation using fuel vaporizer/ mixing device

PDiesel HCCI combustion concept faces significant challenge of
design and integration of a fuel delivery system, which is expected
Xadequate charge homogenization for diesel. To achieve a
to facilitate D
homogeneous mixture in diesel engines, two concepts namely inter-
nal mixture formation and external mixture formation D
Xhave been
investigated. In the external mixture formation approach, homoge-
neous mixture could be achieved by injecting the fuel into the induc-
tion system [179(cid:1)184]. The main challenge is to control
fuel
injection system and charge temperature in order to completely
vaporize the fuel before it is inducted into the cylinder [185]. Several
approaches have been explored, D
Xsuch as using air-assisted injectors
[186] or high-pressure injectors [187]. In the air-assisted injection
system, fuel is injected using port fuel injector inside an air-assisted
cap, where it mixes with the atomizing air supplied externally.
Another method of external mixture preparation may be external
mixture preparation devices such as fuel vaporizer or fuel atomizer
[179(cid:1)184]. Fuel vapors emitted from the fuel vaporizer form a very
light and dispersed aerosol, where due to D
Xsmall size, fuel droplets
lose their momentum at a short distance downstream of the nozzle
(no wall targeting) and follow the intake air motion very well. The
droplets have very fast evaporation due to very high surface to vol-
ume ratio, and disperse uniformly in the surrounding air stream. All
properties of this D
Xaerosol create a highly dispersed homo-
geneous mixture, minimal wall-wetting and very fast evaporation
during the compression stroke [181].

2.2. In-Cylinder charge preparation

PIn this method, fuel is directly injected into the cylinder. Two
possible strategies for premixed charge preparation in direct injec-
tion are (i) early direct injection and (ii) late direct injection. The
main criterion for fuel injection strategy in these methods of pre-
mixed charge preparation is the end of fuel injection before auto-
ignition starts. Although port fuel injection works for gasoline-HCCI,
various studies revealed the advantages of using a GDI system
[51,174,188(cid:1)192]. The possibility of stratifying the fuel-air mixture
with late direct-injection increases local in-cylinder temperature.
This resulted in lower HC and CO emissions hence increased com-
bustion efficiency at lower loads. Direct fuel injection also offers a
limited possibility of phasing the combustion timing using injection
timing [5,193]. Fig. 14 shows a control diagram for combustion phas-
ing by SoI timing in a lean-burn CAI DI gasoline engine. Variations in
SoI timings can control combustion phasing by governing thermal/
chemical effects caused by early injection during the NVO period, or
cooling effect of fuel-air mixture during the intake stroke, or fuel
stratification effect of late injection in the compression stroke [51].

PDirect injection into the combustion chamber has been used for
current diesel engines in order to eliminate the need for elevated
intake temperature by addressing the vaporization problem encoun-
tered in port injected systems [85].

PAn important task of direct injection strategy is to avoid fuel
adhering or condensing onto the cylinder walls. An important
parameter is to control the fuel penetration length, D
Xwith an objective
Xwalls.
to avoid any contact of liquid fuel droplets with cylinder D
Direct-injected diesel HCCI can be achieved by (i) early direct injec-
tion and (ii) late direct injection.

P2.2.1. Early direct injection

PThis method of fuel injection is called early direct injection
because the fuel is not injected towards the end of the compression
stroke, as is the case with CIDI engine, but is instead injected early
(well ahead of TDC) during the compression stroke [3]. During early
injection, lower mean gas temperature and density in the cylinder
reduces fuel vaporization rate and enhances fuel spray penetration
length. On the other hand, “later” early injection timing means rela-
tively higher gas densities and eventually vaporizing conditions,
which lower the jet penetration length and reduce the risk of wall
wetting [194]. Also, the rate of entraining gas mass into the spray is
higher for late injection timings, which create a leaner spray that
mixes faster leading to globally lean conditions [195]. These condi-
tions are illustrated with respect to in-cylinder gas density and tem-
perature in Fig. 15.

PEarly direct injection offers three advantages compared to fuel
premixing in the intake manifold [51]: (1) Direct in-cylinder injec-
tion offers better fuel-air mixing, which is improved by higher tur-
bulence generated during the compression stroke [196]. Higher in-
cylinder temperature, densities and turbulence help in fuel vaporiza-
tion and promote mixing. (2) Use of narrow cone angle injector
reduces wall wetting tendency, which improves combustion effi-
ciency and reduces lubricating oil dilution [178]; and (3) Using early
direct injection, HCCI-CI mode switching can be achieved by a single
fuel injection system. Transition between HCCI and CI modes can be
achieved by varying the injection parameters such as SoI timings,
FIP etc. However, since early injection is performed in a low density
ambient environment, avoiding fuel impingement and cylinder wall
wetting could prove to be a major challenge, which might require
re-designing of either the fuel injection system itself (which presents
stability issues at low injection pressures) or the geometrical
arrangement [172]. If wall wetting can be avoided, an effective
reduction in unburned hydrocarbon emissions is obtained and fuel
efficiency increases [178,197].

PDifferent strategies have been tested for early direct injection
fuel-air mixture formation in HCCI engines. These strategies can

Fig. 15. In-cylinder gas density and temperature with late and early direct injection
regimes [194] (Courtesy of Dr. Wahlin F).

Proughly be divided in impinging sprays [73,79,198], hollow cone
sprays [199,200], and ordinary mineral diesel sprays (cid:1) often in com-
bination with a narrow included angle and/ or multiple injections
[201(cid:1)204]. Several different diesel HCCI combustion concepts have
used early direct injection, utilizing one or more injectors and single
or multiple injections. The most important systems of this type are
PREDIC, MULDIC, HiMICS, PPCI, UNIBUS and NADI.

P2.2.2. Late direct injection

POne of the most successful system achieving diesel fueled HCCI
engines is the late direct injection. DI-HCCI technique known as MK,
was developed by Nissan Motor Company in 1998. This combustion
system is currently used for lower loads and speeds only [205]. In
this concept, fuel is injected directly into the combustion chamber
near or after TDC, but the IDD
X is extended through the use of large
amount of cooled EGR, a reduction in engine CR, and vigorous swirl.
The net result is that the combustion reactions begin well after the
end of injection, and a diffusion-limited combustion jet is not estab-
lished. Late in-cylinder injection of mineral diesel appears to avoid
most problems associated with fuel wall impingement and provides
some control on combustion phasing, but short IDD
X of diesel limits
this approach to low engine loads [7]. The MK-combustion mode is
functional at part loads however the load range can be increased by
increasing the IDD
Xby employing lower CRs and cooled EGR. Applying
a large diameter combustion chamber bowl reduces HC emissions
during cold-start, presumably due to lower wall-impingement of
X and PM
the fuel spray. A higher FIP is effective in reducing NOxD
emissions from MK combustion D
X[80]. Miles et al. [206] examined
late direct injection strategy and found that although longer IDD
promoted formation of a more uniform mixture, it was still far
from homogeneous. It was suggested that the initial part of com-
bustion was dominated by chemical kinetics and a significant por-
tion of the mixture was fuel-rich. Subsequent part was mixing-
controlled combustion-similar to normal CID
X operation. The “homo-
geneous charge late injection” (HCLI) and the “highly premixed
late injection” (HPLI) are the other diesel HCCI combustion con-
cepts based on late direct injection [207,208]. HCLI combustion is
used at low loads, HPLI combustion is used at medium loads, and
high loads could be achieved by conventional DID
XCI combustion
mode.

3. Fuel requirement in LTC engines and fuel management

PAn engine can be operated in LTC mode using practically any fuel
by choosing the right design and operating conditions. However,
with this constraint, practical commercial engines cannot be oper-
ated in LTC combustion mode because they operate over a wide
range of speed and load conditions with acceptable levels of noise,
stability and emissions. A suitable fuel selection enables this breadth
of operation. The development of fuels specifications for use in IC
engines has been an evolutionary process, in which, fuel-related
problems are encountered and critical fuel properties are identified,
and specific limits D
Xenforced to mitigate these problem. Important
fuel properties necessary for achieving LTC and based on these prop-
erties, development of suitable alternative fueled LTC engines have
been discussed in following sections.

3.1. Fuel for LTC: Properties and reaction mechanisms

PPrevious studies have proved that chemical kinetics of fuel/ air
mixtures dominantly controlled LTC, which is dominated by decom-
position of H2O2 radicals [209] and reactions between OH radical
and fuel [210] under practical engine operating conditions [211].
In LTC, ignition and combustion are controlled by physical and
chemical properties of fuel, in which spatial and time history plays
a dominant role in combustion control. Several studies have been

Pundertaken, where different fuels with different chemical composi-
tions have been used in the LTC engines [13,37,212(cid:1)219]. All these
studies showed that different fuels have different combustion phas-
ing in most cases but this difference was small in some engine
operating conditions. In most cases, combustion phasing did not
correlate with conventional measures of fuel's auto-ignition quality
such as Research and Motor Octane Numbers (RON and MON). In
last few years, a large number of studies on LTC using different alter-
native fuels have shown the need of specific fuel properties for LTC,
which cannot be fulfilled using a single component fuelD
X. Therefore, it
becomes important to reform the molecular structure of different
fuel components to change its physical and chemical properties
according to the LTC requirements [9]. The most important require-
ment of LTC is D
Xformation of homogeneous fuel-air mixture, which
results in ideal LTC D

Xnamely HCCI combustion.

PFig. 16 illustrates the fundamental principle of fuel selection for
HCCI combustion engines. A large number of studies have shown
that chemical properties of fuel-air mixture in the combustion
chamber can be optimized using different fuel design concepts such
as D
Xfuel additives, fuel blending, dual-fueling and optimized fuel pro-
portion [9]. Different physical and chemical properties of fuel affect
several processes occurring in the combustion chamber. High cetane
number fuels have potential to improve engine’s cold start capabil-
ity, widen the lean burn limit, lower the cycle-to-cycle variations
and improve the mode transition characteristics but it has negative
effect on rich-burn limits. High octane fuels have D
Xopposite effect asD
that of high cetane fuels [27]. These characteristics were explained
by Lutz et al. [220]. They compared the ignition characteristics of
three different fuels having different Octane and Cetane ratings.
These test fuels showed different ignition characteristics (Fig. 17).

PFuel composition mainly affectD

X the speed of low temperature
reactions that occur in HCCI engines. This in turn is affected depend-
ing on when these reactions are initiated and where in the cycle, the
main reactions occur. Fuels like gasoline exhibit little or no low tem-
perature reaction and initiation temperature is close to 950 K in
HCCI engines [13]. Fuels like mineral diesel exhibit significant low
temperature reactions and corresponding initiation temperatures
are in the range of 750 K in HCCI engines [13]. The volatility or distil-
lation characteristics of the fuel dominate D
Xspray droplet evaporation
in the combustion chamber. For true HCCI engine operation, fuel
must be evaporated and at least partially mixed prior to the SoC
reactions [13]. It is observed that if liquid fuel survives the start of
reactions, these fuel droplets, or packets, will burn in diffusion

NOx in the engine [67,84]. Therefore, it is important to improve the
fuel distillation characteristics, which directly influences fuel-air
mixture homogeneity. This results in absence of localized fuel-D
Xrich
zones, thereby reducing the maximum combustion temperature
leading to reduction in NOx and PM formation [9]. Volatility and
ignition characteristics are the two main properties that will ulti-
mately differentiate HCCI fuels from gasoline and mineral diesel
[13]. Fig. 18 shows the range of auto-ignition and volatility charac-
teristics of different fuels and some common refinery components.
Gasoline like fuels would have an advantage over conventional min-
eral diesel like fuels because they are more volatile and also because
conventional diesel is prone to auto-ignition. Kerosene would there-
fore be better for HCCI combustion than conventional diesel because
Xits superior volatility and lower cetane number (Fig. 18) [211].

PIn HCCI combustion engines, it is quite challenging to maintain
proper ignition timings in the cycle over wide range of operating
conditions. Previous investigations suggested that
the ignition
behavior of HCCI combustion cannot be determined by conventional
measurements of auto-ignition quality of fuels, such as RON and
cetane number [211]. Suitability of fuels for HCCI combustion D
Xis
decided by two parameters namely auto-ignition characteristics
(cetane number) and anti-knock quality (octane number), at both
lean and rich limits. Due to difference in molecular structures and
fuel components, HCCI combustion can have different SoC, HRR, and
exhaust emissions for a group of test fuels with the same cetane

Pnumber or octane number [9]. Therefore, measurements of tradi-
tional cetane or octane numbers are not enough to characterize
the suitability of fuel for HCCI application. To resolve this issue,
several research groups performed long range HCCI experiments to
investigate the effects of different fuel properties such as octane
number, molecular structure D
Xsensitivity to auto-ignition quality
[9,221].

Xand D

PFor identification of ignition quality of D

Xfuels for HCCI combustion,
Kalghatgi et al. [222] defined a parameter called “Octane Index” (OI):

ð
OI D 1¡K

ÞRON C KMON D RON¡KS

Where K is a constant, which depends on the engine-operating con-
ditions and S is the fuel sensitivity (RON-MON) [211].

PCombustion phasing of HCCI combustion is directly related to the
octane index [218]. Higher value of OI means more resistance to
auto-ignition and D
Xretarded heat release. At each operating condition,
there is also a fuel with OID OI0 such that heat release is centered at
TDC, i.e. CA50 D 0. OI0 can be considered to be engine's requirement.
OI0 increases as the maximum compression pressure and tempera-
ture increases and decreases as engine speed is increased or the
mixture is made leaner or more dilute [211].

PSouthwest Research Institute's researchers developed a fuel spec-
ification type test method for rapidly evaluating and rating the igni-
tion characteristics of HCCI fuels. The start of reaction temperature
is measured using ASTM D6890 specified apparatus. This tempera-
ture is called “Elevated Pressure Auto Ignition Temperature” (EPAIT).
Based on the preliminary work, researchers proposed that EPAIT
specifications will likely fall in the range of 550 °C with cool flame
heat release magnitudes in the range of 5(cid:1)10% of total heat release
for HCCI engine D
X[3]. The CAI index was employed to precisely quan-
tify fuel impact on four predefined CAI zones, including low speed/
low-load, low-speed/ high-load, high speed/ high-load, and high-
speed/ low-load zones [213]. Fig. 19 gives the definition of AI index.
This index is used to evaluate suitability of fuel for HCCI application
by comparing the operating window of HCCI mode with that
obtained from the reference fuel.

PIn another study D

Xby Shibata and Urushihara [219], impact of fuel
properties on HCCI combustion was investigated using three differ-
ent fuels (RON: 70, 80, and 92) with the same distillation character-

[224]. This condition can be avoided by reducing OH radical forma-

HRR in low-temperature range [9]. This can be done by addition of
inert additives [225]. Lu et al. [226,227] conducted experiments to
evaluate the effectiveness of n-heptane in HCCI combustion with dif-
ferent inert additives, including methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, and
MTBE. Similarly, high octane number fuels such as isooctane and tol-

reactions [9,228,229]. To precisely control the auto-ignition of gaso-
line-like fuels near TDC, additional methods including EGR, VCR, and
VVT can be used. Additionally, by adding an active additive such as
H2O2, 2-EHN, and di-tert-butyl peroxide (DTBP) to base fuel, condu-
cive thermo-atmospheric environment could be created in the core
areas of combustion chamber [9].

reforming. They reported that natural gas HCCI required high CR as
well as high intake air temperature due to high auto ignition tem-
perature of natural gas. Natural gas HCCI was controlled by hydrogen
blending and addition of hydrogen lowered the intake temperature
requirement. This resulted in lower NOxD
X emissions however it also
increased HC and CO emissions. Bastawissi et al. [241] investigated

Xmulti-dimensional compu-

chemical kinetics. They utilized hydrogen as an additive to control
the auto-ignition timing and combustion phasing of CNG fueled
HCCI combustion. Relatively higher formaldehyde and hydroxyl rad-
ical formation was an important finding of this study. Formation of
these species due to low temperature oxidation was further pro-
moted by hydrogen addition. Noran and Aziz [242] compared the
HCCI combustion characteristics of CNG with pilot injection of gaso-
line and overall lean SI combustion of CNG in stratified charge mode.
Homogeneous charge from gasoline was created by manifold injec-
tion of fuel and the charge was heated by an air heater in order to
achieve HCCI combustion. High temperature charge helped in igni-
tion of directly injected stratified CNG at 80° BTDC. They reported
that HCCI combustion D
Xexhibited higher fuel conversion efficiency

semination of fuel-air mixture, higher combustion efficiency could

Kozarac et al. [247] investigated the effects of addition of n-heptane
on combustion, performance, emissions and control of combustion
phasing of a biogas fueled HCCI engine. Main objective of thier study
was to explore the use of highly reactive fuel as an ignition pro-
moter, which enabled the operation of biogas fueled HCCI engine at
low intake temperatures. They reported that introduction of highly

Pof n-heptane controlled combustion phasing was more effectively
compared to mineral diesel [245]. This was mainly due to high reac-
tivity and volatility of n-heptane, which generated more favourable
conditions for HCCI combustion.

PMaurya et al. [3,18,235] looked into the performance of HCCI
engine fueled with alcohols (ethanol and methanol). Experiments
were carried out to investigate the performance of HCCI combustion
Xfuel ratios. They reported reduction in HC emissions
at different air-D
and increase in CO emission with increasing air-fuel ratio. Zhang
and Wu [248] carried out methanol fuelD
X to
investiagate optimum control parameters namely intake charge
temperature, fuel(cid:1)air equivalence ratio and engine speed for com-
bustion phasing control. They reported that intake charge tempera-
ture influenced both the combustion phasing and heat release rate
significantly. Yang et al. [249] investigated fundamental properties
of a C5 alcohol (isopentanol) as a possible alternative fuel for HCCI
Xin a wide range of
combustion. They performed HCCI experimentD
engine speeds; intake air temperatures, intake pressure, and equiva-
lence ratios. They observed different ignition characteristics of iso-
pentanol as compared to gasoline since isopentanol did not show
two-stage ignition, which was similar to ethanol. Ng and Thomson
[250] performed model analysis of ethanol fueled HCCI combustion
and focused on the effects of ethanol reformed gas on the ignition
requirement and NOxD
Xemissions. PCCI combustion was performed in
a single stage and split injection modes using ethanol blended min-
Xby Mohammadi et al. [251]. In single injection strategy,

ethanol blended fuels offerred D
Xand PM emis-
sions compared to diesel. However, reduced power output puts a
limitation on its usage. The split injection strategy resulted in further
reduction in NOxD
Xemissions without significantly affecting the ther-
mal efficiency of the engine. Emissions were further reduced by
employing cooled EGR along with split injection strategy. Mancaruso
and Vaglieco [252] performed PCCI experimentD
X using ethanol/ air/
diesel mixtures. They observed three stage combustion under vary-
ing rp of in-cylinder charge. They suggested ethanol addition as pre-
mixed charge to be responsible for this combustion behavior.

PBiodiesel blends were used in diesel fueled PCCI engineD
Xrelatively

higher boiling point of biodiesel resulted in longer IDD
X compared to
Xmineral diesel. Moreover, the spray impingement and larger pene-
tration length (for all test cases) was observed for biodiesel blends.
These issues were tackled by Lahane and Subramanian [254] by
modifying the injector nozzle (from 5 holes to 6 holes with a slight
reduction in nozzle diameter). The modified nozzle resulted in
reduced spray penetration and significant reduction in soot and NOxD
emissions compared to mineral diesel. Szybist et al. [255] performed
HCCI combustion experimentD
X in a single cylinder engine using
blends of soy biodiesel and ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD). The
results of HCCI combustion were also compared with simulation
results and major differences D
Xwere in its dependence on bio-
Xfound D
Xduration of low temperature heat release

(LTHR) and duration of main combustion event. Brakora and Reitz
[256] performed experimentD
X to compare formation of nitric oxide
(NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) from biodiesel and mineral diesel
fueled HCCI combustion. They showed higher NOxD
X from biodiesel
compared to mineral diesel. Kitano et al. [214] investigated the effect
of cetane number and distillation characteristics on PCCI combus-
tion. They found that lower cetane number fuel increased IDD
Xunder
high load conditions, which resulted in lower NOxD
X emissions. They
also reported that lower distillation characteristics of fuel promoted
faster mixture formation, which reduced soot formation. Therefore,
it was suggested that PCCI engine fuel should have optimal cetane
number and distillation properties for effectiveD

Xemission control.

etc., newly emerging fuels such as DME and JP-8 are currently being
explored by several researchers for LTC applications. Zhao et al.

P[257] carried out PCCI combustion using blends of DME and diesel.
They observed significant reduction in NOxD
Xand soot emissions with
increasing percentage of DME in mineral diesel. However, brake spe-
cific fuel consumption (BSFC) increased along with an increase in HC
and CO emissions. Jeon and Bae [258] compared D
XPCCI combustion
using two test fuels and used double injection strategy of DME as
reference case and replaced DME main injection by hydrogen in the
second condition. To investigate the effect of hydrogen, they varied
hydrogen quantity. In the experimentD
X, they observed stable combus-
tion for D
X100% DME PCCI combustion however hydrogen-DME PCCI
combustion resulted in relatively higher IMEP. Odaka et al. [177]
used gasoline-type injector for diesel manifold injection in order
to investigate premixed diesel fueled HCCI in combination with
a normal DI system. They used methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE) in
diesel as an additive for delaying the auto-ignition of premixed
charge. Cinar et al. [259] worked with DEE, which acted as a cetane
improver. During HCCI combustion, premixed DEE burnt and gener-
ated suitable conditions for ignition of accumulated diesel during IDD
X.
Like all others fuels, DEE fueled HCCI produced significantly lesser
NOxD
X and relatively higher CO and HC emissions [259]. JP-8 was
tested in a single cylinder PCCI diesel engine by Parks et al. [94]. The
Xand smoke emissions under low load condi-
fuel showed lower NOxD
tions due to its lower aromatic contentD
X, lower cetane number and
higher volatility compared to baseline mineral diesel. However,
under conventional combustion strategy, NOxD
Xemissions were higher
than baseline mineral diesel because of its more dynamic premixed
combustion phase.

PGasoline and mineral diesel are mostly used in conventional
engines. These fuels D
Xare primarily straight chain alkanes, branched
alkanes and aromatics. Investigations on primary reference fuels
(PRFs) show that the auto-ignition behavior of a test fuel mainly
depends on its composition, molecular size and structure. PRF (n-
heptane and isooctane) behave differently during auto-ignition in
HCCI engines. N-heptane is a reactive straight-chain paraffin and has
a low octane number, which D
Xlower resis-
tance to auto-ignition. Iso-octane is a less reactive branched- chain
paraffin, and has a higher octane number [260]. N-heptane and
other paraffinic fuels are characterized by a clearly distinguished
two-stage ignition. The first stage is related to LTHR period and the
second or main combustion is associated with the high tempera-
ture heat release (HTHR) period. The first stage ignition is also
regarded as “cool flame”, with negative temperature coefficient
(NTC) [209]. Fig. 20 illustrate D
Xtypical two-stage heat release in HCCI
combustion showing LTHR (cool flame) and HTHR, using mixture
of isooctane and n-heptane as test fuel. Iso-octane (ON D 100)
bears high resistance to auto-ignition and undergoes a single-stage
ignition [260]. The difference between the two ignition mecha-
nisms has important consequences on the control of CAI combus-
tion [261(cid:1)263].
PFor alkanesD

X, the chain reaction paths are divided into three main
routes [264]. Below 750 K, reactions are dominated by chain propa-
gating steps including oxygen molecules and generation of partially
oxidized species [264,265]. Between 800 K and 950 K, the chain
propagating steps involving D
Xoxygen molecules yield conjugate
alkenes and HO2 radicals [265]. Above 1000 K, the main fuel radical

Pand smaller radicals [266]. Two different regions of chain reactions
are defined based on previous research (i) a low temperature kinet-
ics region or ignition process, below 950 K, and (ii) the high tempera-
ture kinetics region, where bulk of chemical energy is released [209].
PAt low temperatures, the rate of chain branching for straight-
chain paraffins (n-heptane) is much more intense than that of
branched-chain paraffins (isooctane). This is due to the structure of
n-heptane radicals, which lead to higher rates of RO2 isomerization
that leads to chain branching from keto-hydro-peroxide decomposi-
tion [267,268]. Lower reactivity of branched-chain paraffins (isooc-
tane) is not only due to large number of less reactive methyl groups
but also due to presence of tertiary and quaternary D
Xcarbon atoms in
its molecular structure. The homolysis reactions of tertiary and qua-
ternary structures compete with keto-hydro-peroxide formation,
contributing to lower reactivity of branched-chain paraffins [269].
All these indicate that a fuel, which has a long-chain and many
weakly bonded H atom has high isomerization rates, leading to rapid
ignition. For compact and highly branched fuels with a large fraction
of strongly bonded H atoms, ignition is inhibited [260,270].

PChain branching processes playD

X a major role in controlling
ignition of hydrocarbons. For hydrocarbons with two-stage igni-
tion behavior, the first stage of ignition is a result of “cool flame”
combustion and NTC behavior, which is mainly governed by
the low temperature (TD
X< 1000 K) chemical kinetics [260,262].
At lower temperatures (up to 900 K), ignition is controlled by
degenerative chain branching processes, which are characterized
by production of chain branching precursors, RO2 radicals, which
start to decompose above 800 K [260]. Above 800 K, the decom-
position of keto-hydro-peroxide species into several fragments
takes place, in which some fragments act like radicals [209]. Due
to formation of these large number of radicals, chain branching
becomes quite rapid, which adds more energy and OH radicals
to the system [271]. The low-temperature reactions are exother-
mic, which further increase OH radical formation due to increas-
ing temperature of the system [266]. This corresponds to the
beginning of a temperature rise, referred to as “cool flame”. Dur-
ing D
Xcool flames, formaldehyde is also created. Therefore, cool
flames can be traced back by formaldehyde analysis [2].
PAt higher temperatures (900 to 1100 K), intermediate D

Xreactions
dominate the low-temperature reactions, resulting in chain branch-
ing, as shown below [209,260].

concentration history. H2O2 is produced below 900(cid:1)1000 K by low
and intermediate temperature pathways, as presented above. H2O2
concentration increases steadily, with H2O2 decomposition much
slower than its production. H2O2 decomposes rapidly at tempera-
tures around 1000 K, yielding large numbers of OH radicals. Increase
in OH radicals consumes any remaining fuel, resulting in ignition
[209,273].

PWhen the temperature is high enough (over 1100 K), the high
temperature chain branching sequence (H C O2 ! O C OH) takes
Xoverall reactions leading to starting of
place and quickly dominates D
main ignition. This main ignition temperature is identical for D
Xall test
fuels [270]. This shows a distinctive feature that the high tempera-
ture chain branching reaction is “fuel type” independent [260]. The
important requirement for cool flames to induce in-cylinder com-
bustion is the energy requirement so that low temperature reactions
can increase the chamber temperature to the high temperature
region [274]. When the reactions become slower during the NTC
period, high cylinder temperature can be increased sufficiently by
external factors such as external heating or increasing CR, which
forces the engine operation towards high temperature regime by
increasing compression work during compression stroke [275]. At
temperatures above 1000 K, conversion of heptyl radicals to beta
Xdue to the
decomposition products and conjugate olefins takes over D
addition on molecular oxygen. This is also possible by D
Xisomerization
reactions [2].

PIf the temperature rises above 1200 K, the relatively high activa-
tion energy of reaction H(cid:3) C O2 ! (cid:3)O(cid:3) C OH(cid:3)
is overcome and it
becomes the dominant chain branching step [209,276]. The reac-
tants, including one radical, lead to two product radicals. Since
molecular oxygen participates in this reaction, lean fuel-air mixtures
are more reactive in this high-temperature regime, whereas rich
fuel-air mixtures are oxidized quickly at low temperatures due to
chain branching, which depends on radical species formed directly
from the parent fuel [277]. When the high temperature interval is
discussed, two reactions are considered [2]:
H2O2 C M ! OH

(cid:3) C OH

(cid:3) C M

H

(cid:3) C O2 ! (cid:3)

O

(cid:3) C OH

(cid:3)

PThese radical-branching reactions are very important for the
high-temperature regime because the products contain more
radicals than the reactants. The first chain branching reaction
takes place at around 1000 K and it marks the moment of igni-
tion [278]. At temperatures D
Xrises to more than 1200 K, the reac-
Xhydrogen radicals and molecular oxygen no longer

above, rapidly consume the fuel and a rapid increase in tempera-

PCCI combustion were detected by Mancaruso and Vaglieco
[252]. They investigated PCCI combustion in an optical engine
using 100% bio-ethanol injected in the intake manifold and min-
eral diesel injected in the cylinder. In spectroscopic experiments,
they observed that SoC of homogeneous fuel-air mixture was
mainly controlled by OH radicals generated during the interme-
diate temperature heat release. Presence of OH radicals was

PAutomotive engines need to be operated over a wide range of
operating conditions ranging from idle, low speed to high loads,
high speeds. Unfortunately, in HCCI combustion engines, in order to
control the combustion rate and NOx emissions, engine has to be
operated on highly diluted mixtures, which are D
Xdiluted either by air
Xequally
or by residual gas. Therefore, HCCI engines cannot operate at D
high mean effective pressure (MEP) as conventional engines
[37,279]. The range of operating conditions in HCCI mode is there-
fore usually constrained to a relatively small region [90,280]. The
approaches employed to achieve HCCI combustion is a determining
factor for the size and shape of this operating region [279]. The main
constraints of HCCI operating region are shown in Fig. 21.

PUpper boundary of HCCI combustion region is limited by engine
knock. When the fueling rate is increased (i.e. lower λ), D
XHCCI com-
bustion rate also increases and intensifies, and gradually causes
unacceptable noise (due to severity of detonation) D
Xwhich may poten-
tially lead to engine damage, and eventually unacceptably high lev-
els of NOx emissions [3]. Another constraint to the upper boundary
of HCCI operating region is insufficient breathing. Some HCCI
engines employ NVO to trap larger quantities of hot residual gas, in
order to increase the mixture temperature in order to D
Xsuccessfully
achieve auto-ignition [279(cid:1)281]. NVO requires smaller valve lift
X, the trapped mass is
therefore upon increasing engine speedD
reduced, leading to movement of HCCI operating regionD
X boundary
further downwards.

PSharp increase in CO emissionD

X is one of the constraints for the
lower boundary of HCCI operating region [282]. When engine load
decreases, the mixture eventually becomes too lean and the gas tem-
perature during combustion becomes too low for CO oxidation reac-
tions to be completed. The resulting high CO emission significantly
reduces combustion efficiency [279]. Other main constraints at low
loads include highly delayed combustion timing, increased cyclic
variation, and eventual misfiring. This happens due to lack of ther-
mal energy available for auto-ignition of the fuel-air mixture
[279,283,284]. The demand for thermal energy for mixture's auto-
ignition increases at lower loads; however, the available thermal
energy remains low in these conditions. Lack of adequate thermal
energy for mixture's auto-ignition eventually leads to engine misfire.
Xlower boundary of the HCCI operating
At lower engine speeds,
region has an upward trend owing to increased heat losses (Fig. 21),
thus further shrinking the HCCI operating region [279]. Lower
boundary of HCCI operating region is also sensitive to variations in
ambient temperature, which affectD
Xboth the required thermal energy
for auto-ignition of the mixture, and the heat transfer losses. When
the ambient temperature decreases,
lower operating boundary
moves up, and HCCI operating regime shrinks [279].

PThe HCCI operating region limits largely reported in literature are
because of misfire and knocking [3,18,283(cid:1)285]. The knock limit in
HCCI engines is often correlated to the RoPR. The RoPR (dP/ dumax) is
considered as an indicator of noise emanating from the engine and
the degree of violence of combustion [285]. Maximum allowable
RoPR is often acceptable in the range of 5(cid:1)12 bar/ CAD, depending
on the engine speed [27,284(cid:1)290]. It is therefore D
Xappropriate to
XRoPR as a time derivative (in bar/ second instead of bar/
express D
CAD) for accurately predicting knock over a wide range of engine
speeds [290,291]. Maximum allowable limit for RoPR is 4.3 MPa/ ms
[290] and 5 MPa/ ms [291]. A fundamental study of HCCI engine
knock indicated that maximum RoPR is a function of operating
parameters such as intake pressure, which makes it inappropriate
Xknock criterion. Therefore, a new criterion “ringing intensity” (RI) is
recommended [292]. Knock limiting values are 2 MW/ m2 for auto-
motive engines [292], 5MW/ m2 mediumD
X-duty engine [293] and
6 MW/ m2 for truck engines [294].

PAt low loads, fuel flow rate decreases hence the net heat release
also decreases, which leads to reduction in average combustion tem-
perature. Lower combustion temperature results in more unburned
charge, which is characterized by high CO and THC emissions and
Xcyclic variations. Fluctuations of IMEP is used as a measure
Xincreased D
of cycle-to-cycle variations and is expressed as COVIMEP [3]. It has
been found that drivability problems in automobiles normally
arise when COVIMEP exceeds 10% [5]. Consequently, the lower limit
of HCCI operation could be defined as when COVIMEP exceeded 10%
[3,235,284]. HCCI is known for its low COV of IMEP compared to SI
engines however with late combustion timing, the COV of IMEP
increases rapidly. At higher engine speeds, the time window for
proper combustion phasing reduces; thereforeD
Xit is more difficult to
retard the combustion. Researchers found that there is lesser risk
of misfire when the COV is kept under 3.5% [294]. In some studies,
lower boundary of HCCI combustion is limited by partial misfire or
intermittent combustion, which produces high HC and CO emissions.
Partial misfire is often defined in terms of a minimum acceptable
level of combustion efficiency (85(cid:1)90%) [217]. Intermittent combus-
tion is caused by cycle-to-cycle variations in cylinder conditions.
Marginal HCCI combustion is very sensitive to variations in tempera-
ture or composition of the engine charge, and small changes may
cause misfire in a fraction of cycles. The criterion for intermittent
combustion is considered to be acceptable in D

Xu10(cid:1)50 (cid:2) 6 CAD [286].

PSome control approaches can relax these constraints and expand
the D
Xwindow for all types of HCCI engines [280]. Control
Xoperating D
strategies to expand the high load boundary include boosting the
intake air pressure and retarding the combustion timing. But retard-
Xto-cycle varia-
ing the combustion timing is constrained by cycle-D
tions and misfire. Control strategies to expand the low load
boundary include (a) increasing charge stratification by retarding
direct fuel injection timing, (b) throttling the intake air flow, (c)
increasing residual gas fraction, and (d) advancing the combustion
timing. However, advancing the combustion timing is constrained
by inadequate thermal energy for auto-ignition [280,295].

4.3. Heat release rate and combustion duration

PIn HCCI combustion engine, auto-ignition occurs in cylinder at a
very large number of “active sites” throughout the fuel-air mixture,
which leads to higher combustion heat release. Auto-ignition pro-
cess is a result of various complex chemical, physical, and energetic
processes. HRR is a measure of how fast chemical energy of fuel is
converted into thermal energy during combustion. This directly
affects RoPR and accordingly the power produced [296]. For HCCI
combustion engines, HRR curve shape has a distinctive characteristic
form. At first, a slow build-up of heat is observed. Then a rapid
increase in heat release follows. The combustion rate then decreases
to zero in nearly the same manner as it has increased [45]. The shape

Pof HRR curve is almost symmetrical and similar to a normal distribu-
tion curve for high octane fuels. For HCCI engines, critical problems
are the control of ignition timing and combustion rate [7]. In HCCI
combustion, ignition is completely controlled by chemical kinetics,
and is directly affected by D
Xfuel composition and structure,
equivalence ratio, and thermodynamic state of fuel-air mixture
[57,297(cid:1)299]. The speed of chemical reactions is dependent on spe-
cies concentrations, pressure and exponentially on temperature.
Therefore, D
Xcombustion rate is mainly controlled by parameters that
affect combustion temperature and species concentrations. Parame-
ters that affect the HRR are: TiD
X, air/ fuel equivalence ratio, inlet pres-
sure, combustion timing, amount of EGR, CR etc. [69,300,301]. Some
of these parameters are related to each other as well. One of the
main parameters to control D
Xthe HCCI combustion rate is the ignition
timing i.e. when in the cycle, combustion takes place. Fig. 22 shows
HRR for a wide range of combustion timings [298].

PWith early combustion phasing, the HRR is higher and as it is
phased later, hence the burn rate goes down. Lowering the TiD
X150 °C
to 120 °C retards the HRR by over 10 CAD and reduces the peak HRR
by almost a factor of 4 [302]. With combustion before TDC, the
temperature increases both by the chemical reactions as well as
compression due to piston motion. Thus for a given auto-ignition
temperature, onset of combustion before TDC results in faster
reactions. With the conditions having combustion phasing after
TDC, the temperature does not increase by piston motion and D
Xonly
temperature driver would be chemical reactions. This gives a
more sensitive system. Later combustion phasing leads to a more
sensitive system, which makes HCCI combustion control rather
challenging [302].

PThe heat release in HCCI combustion can be D

Xsingle-stage, two-
stage [299] or three stage process [303], depending on the fuel type
and operating conditions. Fig. 23 describes typical heat release for
two-stage combustion. With isooctane (ON D 100), no detectable
cool flames (pre-reactions) appear before the main combustion
(Fig. 22). When n-heptane is used, cool flames appear at 10 to 20
CAD before the main combustion starts. In some engine operating
conditions, gasoline auto-ignites in a three-stage combustion, which
can be defined as a cool flame, a pre-ignition, and a final ignition,
each represented by a heat release maximum [303].

PFor homogeneous combustion, “combustion duration” is a func-
tion of several parameters. The strongest influences on combustion
duration are from λ, EGR rate, combustion timing, CR and engine
speed [300]. Turbulence has a modest influence on HCCI combustion.
Instead, λ and temperature strongly affect the combustion rate,
because homogeneous combustion is controlled mainly by the
chemical kinetics. Turbulence is of course important for the mixing
process to create a homogeneous charge. Combustion duration
increases with reduction in CR and reduced inlet temperature. Com-
bustion temperature becomes lower at lower TiD
X. The change in vol-
ume around TDC is more rapid at a higher CR, which results in lower
temperature, leading to longer combustion duration [69]. Table 2
shows the direction, in which the combustion duration is affected by
these parameters. Upward arrow for any parameter indicates
increase in that parameter and downward arrow indicates reduction
in that parameter.

4.4. Engine efficiency of HCCI combustion

Pthe first-stage pressure increase becomes larger [299]. Auto-ignition
in HCCI combustion is a kinetically controlled process. Rate of reac-
tion determines the combustion rate, which is mainly dependent on
composition of fuel-air mixture and pressure-temperature history in
the cylinder. The charge composition and temperature are mainly
influenced by mixture homogeneity, air-fuel ratio, TiD
X, EGR rate, heat
transfer, CR and engine speed.

PCombustion duration is a measure for rapidness of overall com-
bustion processes. Generally, combustion duration is measured in
terms of CAD, but for a given engine speed, this corresponds to
time of the order of few milliseconds. Combustion duration is often
defined as difference between the crank angle positions of 90%
and 10% heat release, which is called ‘rapid burning phase’. CAD
duration between point of ignition and 10% heat release is known
as ‘early combustion phase’ and CAD duration between 90 to 100%
heat release is known as ‘late combustion phase’.

PCombustion shows a strong dependence on load in HCCI combus-
tion mode. This is due to the fact that HCCI is operated un-throttled
and the load is changed by adjusting fuel flow rate only. At very low
loads, the fuel-air mixture becomes very lean; hence too slow com-
bustion takes place. At higher loads, the fuel-air mixture becomes
richer, which results in extremely fast combustion. The combustion
rate with SI operation is however not significantly affected by the
engine load [45] (Fig. 24).

PTotal engine efficiency can be divided into several fractions in
order to identify the factors, which reduce thermal efficiency of an
engine (Fig. 25) [304]. The combustion efficiency is defined as the
relationship between heat released (QhrMEP) and normalized fuel
energy/ cycle (Fuel_MEP). The thermodynamic efficiency is then the
relationship between IMEP and QhrMEP. Gas exchange efficiency is
defined as the relationship between IMEPgross and IMEPnet. Indicated
efficiency is the relationship between IMEPnet and Fuel_MEP
[305,306]. This makes it possible to compare D
Xengines of different
sizes. To avoid the effect of variation in different engine sizes and
engine speeds, the results can be presented on per cycle basis and
can be normalized D
Xusing cylinder displacement by presenting them
in terms of mean effective pressures.

PHCCI engines have higher fuel conversion efficiency compared to
SI engines, which approaches the efficiency of a CI engine or some-

Ptimes even higher in some special circumstances. This was mainly
due to unD
Xthrottled operation of HCCI engines, which reduces pump-
ing losses, and results in significantly higher thermal efficiency com-
pared to conventional SI engines. Higher CR is one of the most
critical requirementD
X for attaining higher thermal efficiency of IC
engines. Relatively higher CR further increases thermal efficiency of
HCCI engines, which is not possible in conventional SI engines due
to knock limit. Significantly lower in-cylinder temperature of HCCI
engines reduces the energy loss due to heat transfer, which is
Xsignificantly higher in case of conventional engines. Further, smoke-
less combustion enables reduction in radiative heat transfer. Multi-
point simultaneous auto-ignition of charge eliminates the existence
of flame propagation in HCCI engines, leading to relatively faster
combustion, and consequently shorter combustion duration. This
shorter combustion duration brings HCCI combustion closer to theo-
retical constant volume combustion cycles; therefore, delivering rel-
atively higher efficiency [274].

inlet pressure and temperature also increase the IMEP, which
improves indicated efficiency [307].

PHCCI combustion is sensitive to combustion phasing, because it
influences combustion temperature in the cylinder. Advanced
combustion phasing leads to faster HRR, steeper pressure rise and
higher peak in-cylinder temperature, which results in increased
heat losses and less work on the piston, i.e. reduced efficiency.
However, too late combustion phasing also reduces efficiency due

PAnother important variable to understand the trend of indicated

how well the engine is burning the fuel. Obtaining 100% combustion

very good combustion efficiency should be > 95%. Combustion effi-
ciency increases with increasing equivalence ratio, as well as with
higher inlet charge pressure and temperature (Fig. 29) [307]. This is

PHCCI combustion D
Xfor vehicle applications, it must be able to operate
over a wide range of speed and load conditions. The combustion pro-
Xquite similar to that during knocking episode
cess in HCCI engines is D
in a SI engine, wherein heat is released by auto-ignition in a pre-
mixed fuel/ air mixture. However, knocking is undesirable, uncon-
trolled, and only a fraction of the charge auto-ignites in a SI engine,
whereas in a HCCI engine, whole charge auto-ignites simulta-
neously. The high load operation of HCCI engine is therefore,
typically limited by an excessive RoPR during combustion and con-
sequent engine knocking.

PThis phenomenon is illustrated in Fig. 31, which shows a series of
cylinder-pressure curves for various fueling rates in a HCCI engine,
with CA50 held constant at TDC [308]. The maximum pressure rise
rate (MPRR) increases substantially as fueling is progressively
increased to ’ D 0.3. Eventually, the pressure rise rate becomes so
rapid that it excites an acoustic resonance in the combustion cham-
ber causing the engine to knock. This creates a distinct ripple in the
pressure trace, [308]. To explain knocking, Yelvington and Green
[309] proposed that a localisedD
X high pressure can arise in HCCI
engine cylinder from very fast combustion in a given parcel of fuel/
air mixture, and these local over-pressures lead to resonant pressure
waves. For slow enough combustion rates in a fuel/ air parcel, the
parcel will expand and maintain its pressure nearly equal to that of
the rest of the gas in the cylinder. As the combustion rate increases,
the rate at which the parcel must expand in order to remain in pres-
sure equilibrium becomes very fast. When the required expansion
Xexcessive pressure zone
rate exceeds the speed of sound, a localised D
Xdevelops, which leads to knocking combustion [309]. A similar
description was also proposed by Andreae et al. [290].

PIn a HCCI combustion engine, RoPR is used to define knock limit
and is related to combustion noise generated in the engine. RoPR is
often calculated from the measured pressure signal, which may have
signal noise and it gets amplified when derivative is calculated.
Fig. 32 shows the variation of standard deviation in the RoPR signal
(No filter and filtered) using different number of cycles as a function
of crank angle position. Fig. 32 shows that standard deviation in
RoPR is also dependent on the crank angle position and it increases
rapidly during combustion. It can also be observed from this figure
that the value of standard deviation decreases and the maximum
and minimum envelope of the curve come closer with increasD

Xincrease in these three factors leads to an increase in the in-

cylinder temperature and consequently in the burnD
Xrates. Addition-
ally, CA50 is advanced with higher in-cylinder temperatures, and a
more complete fuel oxidation is possible before the piston expansion
causes temperatures to fall to a level, which are too low for oxidation
to complete [307]. Lower combustion efficiency also increases D
XHC
and CO emissions. In HCCI combustion engines, power output is con-
trolled by the fueling rate. Therefore, as engine load is reduced,
either the mixture D
Xdilution by the EGR must
be increased. Fig. 30 shows a curve of emissions and combustion effi-
ciency for HCCI engine as a function of ’ for fully premixed operation
with no EGR at constant combustion timing at TDC.

Xmust be made leaner or D

PIt can be observed from Fig. 30 that for moderate loads, ’ > 0.2,
CO and HC emissions are low and combustion efficiency is high.
However, as ’ is reduced below 0.2, CO emission rise dramatically,
and the combustion efficiency falls. HC emissions also increase, but
to a lesser extent [308]. Although high CO and HC emissions at D
Xlow
loads could potentially be controlled by employing an oxidation cat-
alyst, low combustion efficiency remains a serious concern. One
Ximproving combustion efficiency would be to throttle
solution for D
the engine and operate at a higher ’, but this would results in lowerD
X-
cycle efficiency due to increased throttling losses [308]. In contrast,
charge stratification offers D
Xpotential for overcoming this problem
without any efficiency penalty [308].

PIf knocking occurs over a long period of time, it brings some
Xundesirable effects [310,312(cid:1)314] such as breakage of piston rings,
cylinder head erosion, piston crown and top land erosion, piston
melting, increased air pollution, reduction in engine efficiency, con-
siderable rise in specific fuel consumption (SFC), and possibility of

etc.

PSeveral researchers have noticed that HCCI combustion pressure
traces exhibit pressure oscillations in the combustion chamber but
there is no consensus on the origin or nature of knocking in HCCI
engines [315(cid:1)317]. At high loads, HCCI engine pressure traces often
exhibit large acoustic oscillations with amplitudes as large as several
bars. Oakley et al. [217] considered HCCI engine to be knocking,
when the amplitude of acoustic oscillations exceeded 0.5 bar in 10%
or more engine cycles. The most elementary noise criteria used to
limit the allowable operating regimes for HCCI engine was to specify
a limit on the maximum rate of cylinder pressure rise. Although set-
ting a limit on the maximum RoPR is a useful metric, it does not
appear to be a uniformly appropriate criterion [292]. Knocking

Panalysis in SI engines based on cylinder pressure can be performed
quantitatively, using methods depending on following parameters
[318]: (a) evaluation of a single pressure value, (b) pressure deriva-
tives, (c) frequency domain manipulations, and (d) heat release anal-
ysis. A new method that can represent the knock intensity of HCCI
combustion, independent of engine speed is needed because of dif-
ferent nature of HCCI combustion engines therefore, a new parame-
ter, ringing intensity (RI) was introduced [292]. The RI indicates the

Xdeveloping HCCI engines, it is necessary to understand rela-
tionship between D
Xwith engine operating conditions and fuel
parameters. Theoretical modeling of thermal explosions clearly
shows that the MPRR and HRR increase as ’ increases, and as
the mixture becomes richer [321]. ExperimentD
X and modeling
Xinvestigations of HCCI engines also confirm the same [217,316]. The
maximum HRR is expected to be higher if it occurs when the com-
X-versa. Hence it
bustion chamber volume is decreasing and viceD
depends on CA50. It is also expected to depend on the pressure and
temperature in the engine, which in turn depends on the inlet pres-
sure (Pin) and temperature (Tin) [47].

PIn Fig. 35, MPRR has been plotted against Pmax. There are three
branches corresponding to the three inlet pressures used and in
each branch, MPRR increases with Pmax. MPRR is expected to depend
on ’, Pin, CA50, and S [47]. From multiple linear regressions, best-fit
line is given by;

MPRR D 36:7 ’1⁄2

Where MPRR is expressed in bar/degree; Pin in bar; S is fuel sensitiv-
ity expressed as (RON¡MON); and CA50 in CAD [47].

PMPRR increases with increasing equivalence ratio ’ and inlet
pressure Pin and decreases with increasing CA50 and S, if these
parameters are varied individually, while keeping other parameters
constant. Thus the fuel effect comes in through both CA50D
X and S,
with the sensitive fuels giving lower MPRR, while keeping all other
parameters constant. To understand the factors contributing to
MPRR, Wildman et al. [322] and Scaringe et al. [323] used a simple

PFig. 36 supports the validity of thermodynamic model for MPRR.
Thus MPRR equation may be used to interpret the relationship of
MPRR and combustion parameters. Wildman et al. [322] also
Xreported that at the same NIMEP, dilution by EGR was found to be
effective in lowering MPRR. Dilution by air however increased the
MPRR.

PWhile HCCI itself is similar to knock in a SI engine, the process of
knock in HCCI engines is thought to be caused by a different source.
Cylinder pressure oscillations are initiated by D
Xstrong pressure gra-
dients which are formed when the combustion proceeds unevenly
in the chamber. The noise from the engine is caused by large ampli-
tude resonance patterns in the chamber, when reflections of power-
ful pressure waves transfer energy to the cylinder liner. The energy
is transmitted through the engine structure and a small fraction is

Pa multi-cylinder engine at different load and speed conditions with
EGR and trapped residual gas revealed that EGR is the reason for
delayed ignition, prolonged combustion and extended knock limits
Xvariable
[288]. In another study, it D
Xwas found that EGR together with D
boost and fuel chemistry could be effectively used to foster D
Xa strong
low-temperature heat release consistently [328].

PAnother strategy attempted to reduce the knock intensity is
called “residual-effected" HCCI combustion, in which combustion is
initiated by exhaust re-induction from the previous engine cycle.
Re-induction is achieved using a fully flexible electro-hydraulic
variable-valve actuation system by late exhaust valve closing (EVC)
and late intake valve opening (IVO) strategies without throttling
the intake or exhaust, and without preheating the intake charge.
Using late EVC, exhaust gas from the engine is drawn back into
the combustion chamber during the induction process and this leads
to cooler burnt gases, when they are outside the cylinder. This strat-
X to reduce charge temperature compared
egy is an effective meansD
to a residual gas trapping strategy via NVO with some success
[329,330].

PControlling the stratification of the mixture is another viable way
to control the RoPR using direct injection to develop mild stratifica-
tion in the charge so as to reduce the pressure rise rate at high
loads [331]. However, with direct injection strategy, COVIMEP, NOx
emissions, and indicated specific fuel consumption (ISFC) are higher
compared to port fuel injection strategy [332].

4.6. Cycle-to-cycle variations

PCycle-to-cycle variations have been shown to correlate well with
engine torque variations, thus directly affecting vehicle's drivability
[296]. These are a result of changes in D
Xcharge composition, tempera-
ture and charge formation process. In addition to cycle-to-cycle var-
iations in multi-cylinder engines, cylinder-to-cylinder variations
also occur due to non-uniformD
Xfuel-air mixture distribution among
cylinders and temperature gradients within the physical engine
geometry, resulting in different heat transfer patterns. Therefore, it
is important to minimize cyclic variations D
Xduring the design phase
itself for smoother engine operation and optimized performance in
terms of emissions and efficiency.

Unstable engine operation D
Xwas observed due to temperature sensi-
tive nature of HCCI combustion process. At high engine loads, due to
higher temperature of residual gas and cylinder walls, early and fast
combustion leads to pressure oscillations, and consequently,D
Xknock-
ing combustion may damage engine components. At light loads,
lower initial in-cylinder temperature and lean fuel/ air mixture often
results in cyclic variations such as misfire and partial combustion,
which may lead to high CO and UHC emissions [227].

PCycle-to-cycle variations in the combustion process has long
been a topic of concern to researchers because it adversely affects
engine performance, producing losses in power and efficiency

Pcause for amplification of pressure waves in the combustion cham-
ber [323]. Pedersen and Schramm [324] showed that there are at
least three possible mechanisms, which are responsible for creating
pressure waves in the chamber. These are (i) local explosions, (ii)
pressure wave amplification and (iii) detonations.

PThe relationship between audible knock and in-cylinder gas
oscillations was developed by Draper [325]. When the cylinder
clearance height is small compared to the bore, the oscillation fre-
quencies are given by ‘drum’ modes (Fig. 37). For right circular cylin-
drical geometry, the resonant frequencies are calculated by the
following equation [326];

Here B is the bore of engine, T is temperature, R is universal gas con-
stant and m and n represents circumferential & radial mode of vibra-
tions.

PIt has been observed that the frequency of these acoustic oscilla-
tions agrees well with the calculated frequency for the major acous-
tic resonant mode of the engine cylinder [316]. Vressner et al. [317]
found that most of the oscillationD
Xenergy was in the first mode. Sev-
eral researchers tried to reduce the intensity of HCCI combustion
knocking using turbocharging, trapped residuals, EGR, water injec-
tion etc. Turbocharging has been widely accepted as a means of
extending high load limit of HCCI operating region. When boost air
is supplied to the engine, it operates with a higher charge density
and allows the work output to be increased while maintaining the
level of dilution or sometimes increasing it. Higher dilution level
helps in slowing down HCCI combustion rate [326,327]. EGR and
trapped residuals or their combination is used to reduce the severity
of knock. EGR acts as a low temperature diluent thus lowering the
mixture temperature in the combustion chamber. The level of
trapped residuals depends on valve timing hence the amount of
trapped residuals could be changed on a cycle-by-cycle basis despite
XEGR level. Investigations conducted on
higher timescale for varying D

crucial indicator of engine's performance characterizing engine load

kept under 3.5% [294]. COVPmax is used to indicate combustion sta-

Xvariations in the maximum cylinder
X focused on D
pressure amongst successful cycles. As a result, the cyclic variations
in CAI are shown to be lower and smoother than SI combustion.
However, it has been pointed out that low cyclic variations in CAI
engines lead to low cyclic variations in torque output as well. Several
factors influencing HCCI combustion and the extent of cycle-to-cycle
variations have been identified. These include fluctuations in param-
eters and factors such as (i) intake air temperature and pressure, (ii)
intake air/ fuel ratio or fuel flow rate, (iii) coolant and lubrication oil
temperatures, (iv) D
Xpresence of diluents i.e. external or internal EGR,
(v) thermal and mixture composition stratification as a result of mix-
ture in-homogeneity, (vi) intensity of intake charge motion and bulk
turbulence, (vii) completeness of combustion in the preceding cycle,
and (viii) fuel-air mixing and homogeneous mixture formation strat-
egies [345]. To control HCCI cyclic variations, several different actu-
ation strategies can be employed, which affect combustion timings
such as intake air preheating, VCR, exhaust re-induction, exhaust re-
compression, multi-fuel, and multiple injection strategies. These
actuation strategies are described in detail in a previous study [349].
PXingcai et al. [339,340] investigated the combustion stabilityD
and cycle-to-cycle variations of HCCI combustion using n-heptane,
PRF20D
X, PRF40, PRF50 and PRF60. The study showed that with
increasing octane number of test fuels, COVs of all combustion and
performance parameters increased significantly and distribution of
combustion parameters was more concentrated around mean values
for higher cetane number fuels. Persson et al. [338] performed a pre-
liminary study on D
Xcylinder-to-cylinder and cycle(cid:1)to-cycle variations
of CAI combustion with trapped residual gas. Koopmans et al. [48]
investigated the cycle-to-cycle variations in a cam-less gasoline
fueled compression ignition engine. This study showed a strong cor-
relation between the combustion phasing and gas temperature in
the beginning of D
Xcompression stroke however no correlation was
found between the residual gas temperature at the end of expansion
stroke and the combustion phasing of the next cycle. Maurya and

Xfor HCCI combustion of n-pentane and n-heptane
[342]. This study also showed that cyclic variations were lower near
high load limit and higher CRs. Late cycle auto ignition study in HCCI
engine showed that cyclic variations in IMEP increased rapidly after
particular combustion phasing or late limit. Li et al. [345] examined
the cycle-to-cycle variations of a HCCI engine operated using n-hep-
tane over a range of intake air temperature, CRs and equivalence

ratios, EGR rate and intake pressures. They found that D
XHCCI engine were mainly due to variations in total energy
tions in D

cantly affected by the extent of D
Xcompleteness of combustion in the
previous cycle. The cyclic variations of the HCCI engine correlated
well with combustion phasing and the combustion stability deterio-
rated significantly for retarded combustion. Study also showed that
advancing the combustion phasing helped stabilize HCCI combus-
tion with the exception of knocking conditions. Li et al. [348] investi-
gated the cycle-to-cycle variations of CAI combustion using NVO
strategy. They found that excess air had a significant effect on cycle-
to-cycle variations. High engine speed led to high levels of turbu-
lence, which was beneficial for charge formation and encouraged
stable combustion.

PTemperature inhomogeneity and thermal stratification in the

Xfrom cylinder liner, head, piston

Xcyclic variations in different combus-
tion parameters in HCCI engines [351,352]. Studies indicate that
temperature inhomogeneity has larger influence on HCCI cyclic var-
iations in comparison to composition inhomogeneity [50,171]. HCCI
engines often use port fuel injection (PFI) for homogeneous charge
preparation. PFI engines can have significant variations in airD
X-fuel
ratio due to incomplete vaporization of liquid fuel droplets (espe-
cially at low loads/ lean operating conditions) and cyclic variations
in gas exchange process [353]. These variations cause variations in

XHCCI combustion phasing is not fully characterized by SoC as dif-
ferent combustion durations can have the same SoC. Combustion
duration also influences the IMEP of the combustion cycle. The
cumulative percentage of occurrence for COV of burn duration (BD)

Xleads to smaller cyclic var-

PHCCI cyclic variations dependD

X on the variation dynamics of the
charge and the physics occurring inside the combustion chamberD
X.
Shahbakhti et al. [50] observed three types of patterns: normal, peri-
odic, and weak/ misfired in HCCI combustion parameters. To have
HCCI combustion with low cyclic variations, periodic and misfired
oscillation patterns should be prevented and the magnitude of varia-
tions in the normal pattern should be maintained low. The popula-
tion of consecutive ignitions for a constant operating point can be
used to form a probability distribution for CA50 ensemble. The nor-
mal probability plot is a graphical tool to assess whether or not a
data set follows a pattern of a normal distribution [358]. A normal
probability plot depicts the shape and pattern of deviation from the
normal distribution. Fig. 41 shows the normal probability plot of
HCCI combustion phasing with different engine operating conditions
having misfire and knock. Experimental data points are plotted
against a theoretical normal distribution and if data is normally dis-
tributed, it forms an approximately straight line. Deviations from a
normal distribution are indicative of deterministic components in
the data. This suggests more deterministic patterns in the data at
misfire limit compared to that of the knock limit in Fig. 41.

PA return map can be used to observe the structures inherent in a
time series [161]. Return maps provide a tool to check the probable
interaction between each cycle parameter with its next consecutive
cycle. For a random timeD
Xseries, consecutive cycles are uncorrelated
and the return map shows an unstructured cloud of data points
gathered around a fixed point. With deterministic coupling between
points, the return map shows more structures such as dispersed
data points about a diagonal line [359,360]. A general inherent rela-
tionship of combustion phasing between the current cycle and the
next cycle is shown in Fig. 42. This return map clearly shows a deter-
ministic dependency on the previous cycles.

PInterpretation of return maps is often complicated by the fact
that skewed distributions may produce dispersed data points, even
in the absence of correlations. A widely applicable solution to these
problems is to construct return maps of quantile values of combus-
Xtiming. Fig. 42 shows the return map and
tion timing instead of CA50D
corresponding quantile return map for CA50D
X at different air-fuel
ratios. It is observed from Fig. 43 that for leaner mixtures, the data
points are distributed in the whole plot space. As mixture strength
increases, the points are distributed with uneven density distribu-
X points. This indicates an
tion in areas of higher and lower densityD
increase in deterministic behavior as mixture becomes richer.

Panalysis tools from non-linear dynamics and chaos theory to reveal
more information about engine behavior than what was previously
possible with conventional statistical techniques [361]. Specifically,
more important conclusions can be derived about the effect of vari-
ous engine parameters on cycle-to-cycle variations due to presence
of deterministic behavior. The presence of determinism implies that
intelligent control of the system could be a potential approach to
extend the limits of engine operation significantly. If a controller can
take advantage of deterministic nature of variations and non-linear-
ity of the system, small changes in control inputs such as fuel or
intake air temperature can push the system back to stable operating
point [362]. The non-linearity of the combustion system and lack of
a precise, compact model that satisfactorily describes the dynamic
behavior makes neural-network based controllers a promising
approach. These non-conventional methods are not much used in
analysis of cyclic variations of HCCI combustion and can have
Xpotential to give better understanding of HCCI combustion dynam-
ics. Recently Ghazimirsaied and Koch [363] used chaos theory (sym-
bol-statistics predictive approach) for controlling cyclic combustion
timing variations in a HCCI engine. They found that near the misfire
limit, the return map of uPmax consisted of multiple regions, indicat-
ing non-constant nonlinear combustion timing. Non-random pat-
terns of cyclic variations in ignition timing (uPmax) under specific
operating conditions emerged in symbol sequence analysis as large

Palso increase. On the other hand, if the engine operates at lower tem-
perature, NOx can be suppressed but PM would be high due to lower
oxidation of soot.

PFig. 45 shows this trade-off along with the emission norms in EU
and US. Clearly CI engines must use exhaust gas after-treatment for
NOx and/ or PM. In CI engines, NOx is formed in hot zones with close
to stoichiometric air/ fuelD
Xratios and soot is formed in fuel-rich spray
core zone. In Fig. 45, the normal emission level from a LTC engine
has been displayed. NOx is normally less than 1/500 of the CI engine
levels and no PM is generated in LTC engines [302].

XDI strategies are adopted since the in-

[366]. The importance of piston top land geometry (Fig. 46a) was
investigated by experiments and modeling for a flat ‘pancake’ piston
geometry [367,368]. Fig. 46b shows the variations in the volume

Pfrom 0.26 mm to 1.3 mm or wider, resulted in a reduction of HC
at lower engine speeds and for mixtures richer than λ»2.8. At
1400 rpm, a top land width larger than 1.3 mm was required to
obtain the same results. By opening up the top land to 2.8 mm, HC
was reduced by > 50% in some cases [367].

PFig. 47 shows the geometrical distribution of charge that burns to
completion, the charge that reacts partially and the charge that does
not react at all. In the 0.26 mm top land width case (Fig. 47a), the
charge trapped in the top land does not take part in combustion at
all. With a top land width of 2.1 mm, the consumption of top land
charge is very sensitive to λ. At λ D 4.5, only partial oxidation of
top land charge occurs. The wall quenching phenomenon is very
sensitive to λ and the wall temperature. Fig. 47 shows that wall
quenching is obvious at λ D 4.5.

bulk quenching. Bulk quenching occurs as a result of incomplete

either too fuel-lean or too fuel-rich or alternatively in exces-

heat transfer between the in-cylinder charge and combustion

of mixing within bulk gases. A clear correlation exists between
the maximum cycle temperature and measured engine out HC
emissions [366].

PFig. 48 shows the variation of HC emissions with different

more fuel quantity is burned. The hydrocarbon reduction at

temperatures [369]. The emission of hydrocarbons decreased
when the CR was increased.

PSince HCCI engine is always operated with excess air, an oxidiz-

and fast combustion in combination with a high CR. Research on low

oxidation. Therefore, maximum temperature attained in the cylinder
is determined by the energy content of the fuel injected in that cycle.

Pconventional IC engines [373]. NO formation during combustion of
fuels that D
Xdo not contain nitrogen, is through three main reaction
mechanisms namely thermal, prompt, and N2O-intermediate
[374(cid:1)377]. There is growing evidence of a fourth reaction mecha-
nism of NOx formation involving NNH species [378(cid:1)380]. The ther-
mal mechanism is based on the extended Zeldovich mechanism
[381,382]. The three main reactions are;
O C N2 $ NO C N;

N C O2 $ NO C O;

N C OH $ NO C H;

PThe thermal NO reactions are highly dependent on tempera-
ture, residence time, and atomic oxygen concentration [383,384].
This mechanism has very strong temperature dependence
because of the high activation energy requirement of the first
reaction and the need forD
X dissociation of O2. The first reaction is
usually accepted as being the rate-determining step due to its
high activation energy requirement [374]. The extended Zeldo-
vich mechanism describes the formation of NO in the post-flame
gases of fuel-lean and slightly fuel-rich mixtures (’ < 1.2) [385].
In standard diesel combustion conditions,
it is often assumed
that nearly all NOx
formed via Zeldovich mechanism
[373,386(cid:1)389]. In LTC conditions such as in HCCI engine, theo-
retical chemical kinetics analysis showed that the “prompt” and
“via N2O” formation mechanisms were not negligible anymore
[389,390].

is

PFennimore described the phenomenon of "prompt NO" [391]. It is
called prompt because it was initiated by rapid production of NO in a
flame front, in a fuelD
X-rich mixture. The prompt NO formation in
hydrocarbon-air mixtures is initiated by the reactions of hydrocar-
bon radicals with molecular nitrogen to form atomic nitrogen and
species containing nitrogen elements, which are finally converted to
NO via some reaction sequence. The main reactions proposed to
describe the processes in hydrocarbon flames are [392]
N2 C CHx⬄HCN C N C . . . ;

N2 C C2⬄2CN;

N C OH⬄NO C H

PThis mechanism may also play an important role in the initial
stage of HCCI combustion. Some prompt NO may also be formed
after HCCI combustion is completed, when hydrocarbons emitted
from the crevice region mix with combustion products, which are
not hot enough to oxidize the hydrocarbons completely but can initi-
ate NO formation reactions involving hydrocarbon radicals [393].

PMalte and Prade proposed another pathway, by which, atomic
oxygen and molecular nitrogen can produce NO via intermediate
formation of N2O through a "recombination reaction” [383,385].
O C N2 C M $ N2O C M

PHere M is called a collision partner and represents all the mole-
cules present. The N2O then reacts with atomic oxygen and atomic
hydrogen to produce NO.
N2O C H $ NO C NH

N2O C O $ 2NO

PNO formation via the nitrous oxide pathway is more complicated
than thermal NO. It was demonstrated that this mechanism plays an
important role in NO production under extremely lean and LTC pro-
cesses, such as in the lean operation of SI engines and gas turbines
[393]. For moderate NOx levels (in the range of 10 ppm), N2O reac-
tions play an important role in NOx formation. N2O is also most likely

Pto be present in the exhaust of HCCI engines [373]. It is accepted that
N2O is normally formed at relatively low combustion temperatures.
N2O emissions are very low (< 0.5 ppm) for normal HCCI combustion
and increase when incomplete combustion occurs [393].

PThe NOx emitted from IC engines mainly consists of NO and NO2.
X of NO2
NOx emissions from HCCI combustion primarily compriseD
under both, normal and knocking D
Xconditions. The contribution of NO
to total NOx is relatively small. In comparison, NO is the main NOx
component, when incomplete combustion occurs [393]. Fig. 51
shows the NO formation as a function of maximum temperature, cal-
culated from cylinder pressure trace. Different cylinder gas tempera-
ture is obtained using different air-fuel ratio. The NOx trend shows
almost exponential dependence on maximum mean gas tempera-
ture and very low emission levels were measured with ethanol. The
amount of NOx produced is dependent on D
Xfuel type to some degree.
Fuels with high ignition temperatures (high octane number) require
XTi to ignite. Higher ignition temperature
a higher CR and/ or higher D
leads to higher combustion temperature, further leading to higher
XNOx formation.

PFig. 52 shows how the amount NOx produced is affected by fuel's
octane number, CR and TiD
X. NOx emissions increase with increased
fuel octane number since a higher temperature is required for auto-
ignition of higher octane fuel.

levels are low, and further decrease with increasing EGR. This

PCO oxidation is dominated by the first reaction. The OH level

especially sensitive to the combustion temperature. For operation at
1200 rpm with combustion phasing at TDC using isooctane as fuel, a
minimum required peak temperature of the order of 1500 K was
identified [145]. In LTC engine, CO is dependent on λ and on inlet air
preheating. Close to rich limit for LTC and with early combustion

still quite high due to LTC operation using ultra-high EGR. Ogawa
and Li [402] investigated the effect of EGR on unregulated emissions.

molecular weight hydrocarbons increased with increasing EGR. Natti

as swirl ratios, FIP, SoI timings and EGR on unregulated emissions

PHCCI combustion concept is known for its potential for very low
NOx and particulate emissions, which are usually close to negligible.
However recent investigations have shown that although the total

nano-particle size measurement instruments, which are also suit-
able for studies of HCCI particulateD

injection strategy at various fuel injection timings [282]. A scanning

this study. HCCI combustion was achieved with intake temperatures

(Fig. 58). At two of the HCCI conditions (air/ fuelD
XD 34), accumulation
mode particle number concentrations were higher than that of DISI
operation and the mode itself was at a larger mobility diameter. The
presence of large accumulation mode particles was explained by the
existence of at least some degree of diffusion burning. The HCCI con-

tions. Lower in-cylinder temperature with extremely lean operation
prevents full oxidation of the boundary layer and crevice bound
hydrocarbons, thereby increasing the concentration of hydrocarbon
precursors to enable higher nucleation.

study of HCCI particle size distribution using DI-HCCI system by
injecting unleaded gasoline directly into the cylinder employing
NVO, in order to capture the residuals. The main focus of this
work was to explain the consequences of intake air heating on PM

soiling of buildings. These properties depend on particle size distri-
bution, shape, and composition [411]. Particles interact with light by
absorbing/ scattering it. For diesel exhaust particulateD
X, absorption is
much stronger than scattering and is relatively independent of parti-

Pthe inlet air, PM emissions from HCCI engines can be reduced. The
effect was mainly due to higher in-cylinder temperature during
compression stroke, leading to improved fuel evaporation. Since
evaporation and wall wetting phenomenon are unique to DI fueling
strategies, therefore this trend may not be D

PFig. 59 shows the effect of injection timing on particle size-num-
ber distribution in a HCCI engine operated at 2500 rpm. The DI mode
of fuel delivery led to discovery of high sensitivity of PM formation
to the injection timings. Injection timings were reported in terms of
EoI and were varied from 250° BTDC to 350° BTDC of the compres-
sion stroke. The most advanced SoI timings generally showed the
highest PM mass and number emissions even though mixing times
were the longest. The authors attributed this to wall wetting effects
from impingement of most fuel on the piston surface. They also
noticed that PM emissions were very closely coupled to mixture
homogeneity for this type of HCCI engine.

PFranklin investigated the effect of different HCCI control strate-
gies on particle emissions [419]. Findings of this study strongly sug-
gested that although essentially free of accumulation mode (soot)
particles, nucleation mode particles are present in insignificant mass
and numbers in the exhaust of a fully premixed HCCI engine. Precur-

6. Combustion control strategies for LTC operating window
expansion

PStable and efficient operation of LTC engines need precisely con-
trolled combustion timings. One of the main challenges in LTC
engine is combustion control since the onset of combustion depends
on in-cylinder temperature, pressure, and fuel-air mixing inside the
combustion chamber and there is no direct actuator to start the
combustion. When the combustion control is not fast enough, too
advanced or too retarded combustion can take place in the engine.
Too advanced combustion can yield unacceptable RoPR or unaccept-
able peak cylinder pressure, causing excessive noise, which may
potentially damage the engine. Additionally, NOx emissions from the
engine tends to increase with ignition advance [352]. Another driver
to have an effective closed-loop combustion control is the fact that
late combustion timing leads to incomplete combustion and increas-
ing emissions of CO and HC. The worst case of ‘too late combustion’
is a complete misfire, which if repeated, can cause engine to stall.
Another possibility is that the engine enters a vicious circle with one
misfiring cycle followed by a cycle with very strong combustion due
to fuel-rich residuals, followed by another misfire and so on [423].
Xproper choice of combustion timing at each operating point is
Thus, D
crucial for LTC engines. A further complication is that the LTC igni-
tion process is very sensitive and frequently comes to the brink of
instability. In fact, some LTC operating points are inherently unsta-
ble. This means that it is impossible to map an LTC engine reliably.
Therefore, closed loop combustion control is necessary to guarantee
correct combustion timing [423].

PLTC engines specially the ones operating in HCCI mode do not
have a direct actuator for combustion timing. Therefore, feedback is
required to control the combustion timing of the engine. The com-
bustion timing can be defined based on several different criterionsD

Psuch as position of 10 or 50% heat release, point of peak pressure or
peak pressure rise rate etc. [424]. For closed-loop control of combus-
tion timing, it is necessary to measure the combustion timing. There
are several sensors used for combustion phase sensing. The most
commonly used method for combustion phasing determination is by
using heat release analysis of cylinder pressure data. In a laboratory
environment, piezoelectric pressure transducers are generally used
for in-cylinder pressure measurementD
X. However, due to higher cost
and shorter life time of piezoelectric pressure transducers, they are
not used in production grade engines. However, several lowD
X-cost
piezo transducers exist for pressure sensing [425,426]. The accuracy
of these low cost sensors is probably sufficient for feedback control
of HCCI combustion phasing [427]. Optical pressure transducers are
also used for combustion timing determination [423]. One of the
most promising technologies in combustion phasing is inexpensive
ion current sensors, which use D
Xelectronic conductive properties in
the reaction zone [428(cid:1)430]. The drawback with ion current sensing
is that it gives only local information, but if the charge is homoge-
neous, a local measurement is sufficient. The ion current signal is
dependent on D
Xfuel properties and engine operating conditions [427].
Another means to obtain the combustion timing is to use knock sen-
sors or microphones on the engine block [431,432].

PSeveral means to actuate the combustion phasing in HCCI engine
control have been suggested by researchers such as dual fuel,

Pvariable valve actuation (VVA), VCR and thermal management
[433,434]. They all fulfill the requirement of fast actuation, which is
needed to control the combustion phasing, however all methods
have their own benefits and drawbacks. Kawano et al. [435] investi-
gated various strategies using control parameters such as injection
timing, injection pressure, internal/ external EGR, boost pressure,
and VVT to control ignition timings of diesel HCCI engines. In the
experimentD
X, it was found that combination of these strategies can
control the ignition near TDC at each operating condition. In addi-
tion, low smoke and NOxD
Xemissions were realized without a drastic
increase in THC and CO emissions. These results show the possibility
of diesel HCCI operation at wide load ranges. Following sub-sections
describe different control strategies and their status in HCCI engines.

6.1. Dual-fuel control strategy

PIn dualD

X-fuel type controls, two fuels with different auto-ignition
properties are used. The system will have a main fuel with a high
octane number and a secondary fuel with low octane number [71].
Different auto-ignition properties of dual fuel system was used to
control the combustion phasing in LTC as blending two fuels in dif-
ferent proportions change D

cial fuels or mixtures of single-component fuels and commercial

6.2. Variable valve timing (VVT) and variable compression ratio (VCR)
strategy

PFor LTC control, there are two major methodologies namely
residual gas control and effective CR control, which were also inves-
tigated [423]. VVA provides a very fast means of affecting the breath-
ing of the engine. VVA can be used to control the initial charge
temperature by retaining residual gas or rebreathing hot exhaust

Pgas through the exhaust valve. Another way to control the charge
temperature is by advancing or retarding the IVC timingD
X. This
reduces the effective CR of the engine. Use of VVA for control of HCCI
engine is of growing interest and researchers are exploring it using
both modeling and experiments [442(cid:1)444].

PMatthews et al. [445] developed a controller for a single cylinder
engine with electromagnetic VVT control (also known as CAI opera-
XCAI regime, the results indi-
tion). Under open-loop operation within D
cated that the engine response was bipolar in nature: (a) the engine
either responded quasi-statically to the open-loop control, or (b) the
CAI combustion failed. Based on these results, a load following con-
troller with a table-look-up feed-forward component and a feed-
back component based on the cumulative difference between the
targeted and measured output was developed. Jia et al. [102] investi-

be achieved by several different methods. Lack of control over indi-
vidual cylinder, which is necessary to obtain good combustion phas-
ing control
is the main drawback of VCR system. Cost and
complexity of VCR systems are the other major obstacles for its
application in HCCI engines [427].

6.3. EGR strategy

PEGR is essential to achieve simultaneous low soot and NOxD

Xemis-
sions from LTC engine without prohibitively high fuel consumption
penalties due to poor combustion phasing. Tuning the D
XEGR rate is
the most commonly used technique to adjust in-cylinder tempera-
ture, which controls SoC. Initially, Thring [66] achieved HCCI com-
X and EGR fraction over a wide range of
bustion by varying the TiD
equivalence ratios. High heat capacity constituents of EGR are CO2,
X and other intermediate
water, nitrogen, oxygen, CO, PM, HC, NOxD
species of combustion reactions that controlD
X the HCCI combustion
[446(cid:1)448]. These constituents show following four effects on com-
bustion and emissions. First is the preheating effect, in which, the
inlet charge temperature increased when the hot EGR was mixed
with air/ fuel mixture. Second is the dilution effect, where the intro-
duction of EGR led to substantial reduction D
Xin the oxygen concentra-
tion. Third is the heat capacity effect, in which total heat capacity of
mixture of EGR, air, and fuel would be higher owing to higher heat
capacity of CO2 and water vapor. This would lead to a reduction of
Xcharge temperature at the end of the compression stroke. Final is
the chemical effect, where unburnt combustion products in EGR
would take part in chemical reactions. HC, CO, CO2, NO, H2O, etc.
present in the EGR take part in the chemical reactions, D
Xleading to a
moderate effect on the reaction rates. Integrating all these effects,
SoC during HCCI combustion and combustion duration of overall
HCCI-DI combustion can be controlled by regulating EGR quantity.
Therefore, EGR makes it possible to suppress the excessively
advanced SoC by low temperature reactions in the HCCI phase. This
excessively advanced and rapid combustion causes knocking, which
limits the operating range of HCCI combustion. EGR can be classified
as internal EGR and external EGR [449]. The internal EGR rate can be
obtained by changing valve overlap period and external EGR rate
can be adjusted by the combined effect of the exhaust back-pressure

PHigh EGR levels reduce combustion temperatures and result in
pyrolysis of fuel, which forms soot precursors. Aceves and Flowers
[451] reported that low temperature diesel combustion exhibits low
soot precursors at low EGR, but it increased rapidly as EGR rate

Xsoot precursor production.
Although EGR gases are cooled prior to reaching the inlet manifold,
intake air temperature rises with EGR fraction as cooler fresh air is
displaced. When developing the MK regime, Kimura et al. [452]
reported a reduction in intake gas temperature from 117 °C to 67 °C,
which decreased soot emissions by 90% and NOxD
Xemissions by 30%.
Ishikawa et al. [453] investigated the effect of heat exchanger effi-
ciency of an EGR cooler on combustion by improving cooler heat
rejection from 2.8 kW to 7.3 kW. The temperature in the intake man-
ifold decreased from 110 °C to 36 °C, increasing the charge density

that high EGR can also be used to control the RoPR by altering the

HCCI engines. Fuel additives mainly affect the LTR, which in turn
affects the start of main reaction. Main fuel parameters influencing
the physical delay part of ignition delay (ID) are the density, heating
value and latent heat of vaporization. The chemical delay part of ID
is influenced by the auto ignition and distillation properties of the
fuel. An increase of fuel density, volatilization difficulties and higher
latent heat of vaporization (due to decreasing air/ fuel mixture tem-
perature), all result in a delayed combustion start/ ignition. Common

tackled by using split injection strategy and by optimizing the spray

split injection in order to promote low temperature ignition and
to get better control of combustion. A major quantity of fuel was
injected early in the compression stroke (100° D

6.6. Closed loop control strategy

PVarious combustion feedback and control strategies have been
Xexperimental
discussed earlier and many of them have been used in D
studies. DualD
X-fuel control was the first published method for close-
X-
loop HCCI control [71]. In this investigation, a six-cylinder heavyD
duty engine was equipped with two port fuel injection systems that
allowed individual in-cylinder injection of two different fuels. Gain
scheduled cylinder-individual controllers with proportional, integral
and derivative (PID) action were used for combustion phasing con-
trol of the HCCI engine.

PFig. 65 shows the response to a step change in the combustion
phasing reference. The controllers responded to the reference
change by gradually increasing the octane rating of the injected fuel,
i.e. by increasing the amount of iso-octane and decreasing the
amount of n-heptane. Thus the fuel became more resistant to auto-
ignition, hence retarding the combustion [423]. Maurya and Agarwal
investigations of closeD
X-loop
[466] also conducted experimental

PDevelopment of a LTC engine for full load operation is a longD

bines the conventional CI/ SI combustion mode and LTC mode. Major
hurdle of the dual combustion system is the cost and complexity
associated with the development of an engine control system, which
can adjust engine in a suitable combustion mode of operation based
on D

Xprevailing engine operating conditions.
PMany researchers suggested that during combustion mode
switching between LTC and SI combustion, the engine can be oper-
ated at throttled and stoichiometric conditions, where high cyclic

investigate the effects of spark ignition on the transition smoothness
however they did not achieve satisfactory results. Therefore, they
concluded that the engine speed and BMEP fluctuations during the
mode transition cannot be eradicated only by spark ignition and sug-
gested the combination of other control strategies for optimization
of engine performance during mode transition. Daw et al. [161]
investigated the effect of spark timing on HCCI-SI transition charac-
teristics. ExperimentD

in a gasoline engine. They found a high degree of deterministic cou-

Xpartially homogeneous
mixture of DME and air in engine cylinder by supplying air in the
intake port and DI of fuel by supplying pressurised DME into cyl-
inder using conventional CI fuel injection equipment during the
X, pilot quantity of DME was

found to be one of main variables affecting D
XPCCI-DI combustion.
Wang [476] developed a non-linear control system for smooth
mode transition between LTC and CI combustion. This system
combined the transient response D
Xfrom variable nozzle turbo-
charger (VNT) and EGR for achieving faster mode transition. Fang
et al. [477] investigated the influence of injection parameters on
the mode transition between CI and HCCI combustion modes. The
experimentD
Xwere performed under eight different operating condi-
tions consisting of different FIP's, SoI timings, and fuel quantities
(first and second injection) to investigate the combustion charac-
teristics. They observed transition from HCCI to CI with increasing
first injection fuel quantity and retarding SoI timing. Fang et al.
[478] found the variation in FIP as the main control parameter for
mode switching between CI to HCCI and viceD
X-versa. For smooth
transition from CI to HCCI, FIP should be changed as fast as possi-
ble in synchronization with EGR and SoI timings. Similarly, for
HCCI to CI mode switching, FIP should be low and sufficient fresh
air should be supplied using VNT control. Busch and Assanis [479]
developed a HCCI-CI mode transition system and reported delay
in charging system and EGR regulation, which resulted in some
cycles with high HC emissions and low IMEP. Burton et al. [480]
performed mode switching experimentD
X and focused on emission
characteristics during mode transition from CI to HCCI. In the
X, they observed a peak in HC emissions during PCCI to

PCCI mode transition showed a NOxD
X peak due to relatively higher
in-cylinder temperature during CI combustion. They concluded
that air-D
Xinduction system played a critical role in mode transition
from CI to HCCI and vice-versa. In further research carried out by
Kim et al. [481], shortening of response time was achieved by
reducing the length of EGR line. They also reported that smooth
transition from PCCI to CI required relatively higher/ lower fuel
quantity D
Xcompared to both PCCI and CI combustion modes indi-
vidually. This factor was further analyzed by Shi et al. [482] and
they reported that during D
Xmode transition from CI to HCCI, engine
efficiency suffered due to slightly higher fuel consumption. Higher
fuel consumption during mode transition may be attributed to
pressure oscillations. Banerjee and Rutland [483] tried cam-less
valve-train system for EGR regulation in order to achieve mode
transition between CI and HCCI.

PIn several studies, a different approach of fueling strategy was
followed for mode transition between CI and HCCI combustion. To
Xgain superior control of RoPR, Han et al. [484] used multiple fuel
Xtransition from CI to HCCI mode and suggested to
injections during D
increase the fuel D
Xquantity injected during early transitional cycles.
Asad et al. [485] developed a mode-switching algorithm for transi-
tion from single injection LTC to multiple-injection LTC based on in-
cylinder pressure. They use IMEP closed-loop control to achieveD
desired smoothness. A pre-defined sequence triggered by an IMEP
threshold was implemented to enable the switching between these
two LTC modes. Rohani et al. [486] conducted the experimentD
X in a
single cylinder heavy-D
Xduty diesel engine and studied the effects of
injection strategy on mode transition emission characteristics. They
proposed a strategy based on gradual mode switching, in which they
took few engine cycles as the transition period during which, injec-
tion timing and injected fuel quantity were shifted. Using this tech-
nique, they observed 41% reduction in HC emissions compared to
the case with simple abrupt shift in injection timing and injected
fuel quantity.

PCanova et al. [487] investigated CI-HCCI combustion mode
switching based on external mixture formation. They improved the
smoothness during mode transition by installing an atomizer in the
intake air system for making homogeneous fuel-air mixture. Ouyang
et al. [488] proposed a hysteresis combustion mode determination
method to avoid combustion mode fluctuations due to variations inD
engine speed or engine load in a small range. This strategy was based
on fuel injection parameters and EGR control, which directly con-
trolled the fuel-air mixture quality and resulted in appropriate com-
bustion according to engine operating conditionD
X. Deng et al. [489]
studied fuel compensation strategy to improve smoothness of IMEP
in mode switching process. Based on the optimum fuel compensa-

smoothness of combustion phasing during mode switching process.

6.8. Other strategies

PMany other control D

Xstrategies have been attempted for HCCI con-
trol such as physical model based control, experimentally derived
model based control, and manually tuned controllers [488]. Several
researchers have used physical model based controllers for HCCI
combustion control. Closed loop combustion control of HCCI engine
using PID controllers and model based controllers are described
using an active valve train (AVT), and hydraulic valve timing system
[489]. The development of a physical model for non-linear control of
HCCI was done [474]. Researchers used a simplified non-linear feed-
back controller to regulate CA50 during load transients. Control was
done by modifying the lift of the secondary exhaust valve opening in
order to control internal EGR. Shaver et al. [490] developed a multi-
ple input multiple output (MIMO) controller, which was used to
decouple the control of combustion timingD
Xand peak cylinder pres-
sure. Kulzer et al. [491] developed both data driven and physics
based models that were used to design controllers to track load,
while regulating the pressure rise and CA50.

PSeveral investigators also used empirically-derived model based
controllers. Use of system identification to design model based con-
Ximplementation of these controllers on various engine
trollers and D
test setups was also attempted [492(cid:1)494]. Pfeiffer et al. [495] used a
model based Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) controller, which was
developed using system identification techniqueD
X. The model based
LQG controller was shown to perform slightly better than the manu-
ally tuned PID controller. FTM was used in yet another study to con-
trol CA50 timing [19]. In this study, control was D
Xgained using a
manually tuned PID loop. The time constant was found to be 8
engine cycles, which was noted as being relatively slow. Bengtsson
et al. [496,497] examined potential future HCCI control strategies.
They suggested that more detailed physical model based controllers
Xare required. It was also indicated that cycle-to-cycle control of
trapped residuals would be extremely beneficial for HCCI control.

7. Path forward for LTC technology

PRecent research activities related to LTC have significantly influ-
enced development of different combustion control mechanisms
and operating strategies for a practical LTC engine. However, before
commercial production of HCCI engines for heavy-duty and light-
duty applications, tremendous R&D effort is required in the follow-
ing directions:

P(i) Development of control methods for maintaining ignition tim-
ings at higher engine loads and speeds is the first major chal-
lenge, which needs to be resolved. Optimization of ignition
timing is far more important for LTC engines as compared to
conventional engines because LTC engines have no direct control

over ignition timingD

trollers such as MIMO, LQG etc. in order to control D

PtimingD
Xfor implementing LTC technology in both CI as well as in
SI engines. However, these techniques need to be further
Xcomplexity and easier adapt-
Xevolved in order to reduce their D
ability in production grade engines.

P(ii) Methodology development to slow down the HRR in LTC engines
at high loads is the next challenge, which needs to be resolved,
in order to prevent excessive noise and possible engine damage.
(iii) Development of emission control systems and control strategies
to overcome the challenges of maintaining acceptable level of
emissions, particularly at low loads. At low and moderate loads,
LTC engines emitD
Xvery low NOxD
X; consequently, no emissions con-
X. However, as the operating range
trol is required to reduce NOxD
Xemissions become excessive, and
is extended to high loads, NOxD
the combustion rates becomeD
Xtoo rapid. Literature also revealed
that LTC especially in SI engines emits large amount of unregu-
lated pollutant species, which can be controlled by using suit-
able after-treatment devices. Therefore, research is required to
develop lowD
X-cost catalysts to control these emissions emanating
from LTC engines.

(iv) Development of feedback and closed-loop control of the fuel and
air systems is essential in order to keep the combustion opti-
mized over the entire speed and load range of the engine in a
production vehicle. Control mechanisms, sensors, and appropri-
ate control algorithms are the key enabling factors for develop-
ing a practical LTC engine. Under closed-loop control, the engine
management system controls engine parametersD
X such as fuel
flow rate and EGR, in response to the inputs from various sen-
sors. Some advanced control techniques such as FTM, MPC, etc.
need to be further explored in order to reduce the response time
and to improve input/ output control.

P(v) Research is needed for the development of intake and exhaust
manifold design for multi-cylinder engines in order to overcome
the challenge of maintaining strict uniformity of the inlet and
Xeach cylinder, in order to ensure smooth
exhaust flows to/ fromD
engine operation.
In multi-cylinder engines, manifold wave
dynamics can cause small differences in the amount of hot resid-
Xeach
uals remaining and the amount of fresh charge delivered to D
cylinderD
X. In conventional SI or CIDI engines, these small differen-
ces between cylinders do not significantly impact the combus-
tion. However, LTC engines are very sensitive to small changes
X and temperature. These
in compressed-charge compositionD
small differences can lead to significantly high cylinder-to-cylin-
der variations. Effect of intake and exhaust manifold design is
significantly dependent on LTC technique because in-cylinder
mixture preparation techniques such as PCCI, PPC, etc. are
Xin-cylinder conditions however other LTC
more sensitive to D
techniques such as HCCI, RCCI, etc. are less sensitive to in-cylin-
der conditions.

(vi) DualD

X-mode engines seem to be a potential solution for adapta-
tion of LTC in production grade engines rather quickly. R&D
Xmode concept to a
efforts are needed to investigate the dual-D
wider range of operation and to develop strategies to smoothly
transition between LTC and SI or CIDI combustion. Many
researchers reported that mode transition from SI to HCCI
resulted in slightly inferior engine performance. D
XHowever a sim-
Xincreased emis-
ple mode transition from HCCI to SI resulted in D
sions. Therefore strategies need to be developed to control
mode transition with satisfactory engine performance and mini-
mum NOxD
Xand smoke emission spikes. This can be achieved by
changing valve profile, throttle response and by adjusted fueling
rate and spark timing according to engine load. To make prog-
ress towards D
Xpractical applications of LTC in CI engines, two
approaches are necessary. First is the provision of combustion
robustness and second is the combustion mode transition to
conventional combustion at high loads. Combustion robustness
can be achieved using advanced flexible fuel injection system,

Pwhich optimizes fuel injection parameters. This type of fuel
injection system varies fuel injection parameters such as FIP,
SoPI, SoMI, number of pilot injections etc. according to engine
speed and load conditions. At lower engine loads, engine can be
operated in LTC mode using single pilot injection at higher FIP.
However, at medium engine loads, engine can be operated in
LTC mode using two or more pilot injections. With further
increase in engine load, combustion can be switched from LTC
to conventional CI combustion, where engine can be operated at
lower FIP using single main injection.

8. Conclusions

Xrequirement of closed loop control on SoC, D

PLTC is a combustion concept, which has evolved over decades in
Xof gasoline-
response to the need for improved thermal efficienciesD
X and soot emissions of diesel-
fueled engines and ultra-low NOxD
fueled engines. Although remarkable progress has been made in LTC
technology, large-scale production of LTC engines for commercial
applications has encountered several difficulties. Limited operating
range, D
Xand higher HC and
CO emissions are the main obstacles faced by LTC technology's adap-
tation commercially. Several techniques have been developed for
lowD
X-load applications of LTC technology in heavy-duty engines how-
ever full load application, even in light-duty engines has not been
demonstrated till now. To control the SoC, some advanced concepts
such as spark assisted LTC and laser assisted LTC have also been
investigated, in which combustion events aD
Xre precisely controlled
using a spark plug or laser. Different derivatives of LTC such as PCCI,
PCI, PPCCI, HECC etc. were thoroughly investigated and suitability of
each derivative was defined for a particular operating range. These
derivatives of LTC can be achieved by varying engine operating and
control parameters. Fuel flexibility is D
Xanother important feature of
LTC. Fuel properties significantly affect chemical kinetics, which has
a dominating role in LTC. Based on engine design, operating condi-
tions and control strategies, different fuels such as biodiesels,
alcohols, DME, DEE, biogas, hydrogen, CNG, kerosene etc. were dem-
onstrated for LTC. In LTC, auto-ignition was controlled by modifica-
tions of the fuel properties in order to make it more chemically
reactive by adding an ignition promoter or inhibitor. Using this con-
cept, researchers developed a novel LTC approach namely RCCI com-
bustion, in which LTC was controlled by two different fuels having
different chemical kinetics.

X. Based on D

PIn all derivatives of LTC, combustion control is the most critical
issue, which D
X-
Xmay be resolved using various techniques such as dualD
fuel injection, VCR, VVT, EGR, etc. However, these techniques have
their own merits and challengesD
Xresearch directions, sev-
eral researchers proposed use of dual-mode combustion system,
which seems to be an effective solution for commercializing LTC
technology in near to medium term. In this approach, conventional
Xare combined with LTC however the
combustion systems (SI or CI) D
cost of the vehicle and system complexity D
Xremain key issues, which
prevent its commercialization as of now. Therefore, for long-term
development of LTC systems, flexible fuel injection system, EGR con-
Xpreparation, as well as high boost to extend
trol for better chargeD
higher load limits, are some of the key factors, which need to investi-
gated and then only a commercially viable LTC engine can be devel-
oped and made available.
