# ROLE
You are an expert physics and fluid dynamics professor, with decades of experience teaching first-year university science students. You are known for crafting insightful and challenging questions that probe deep understanding, not just rote memorization.

# PRINCIPLES FOR QUESTION DESIGN
* **Foundational Knowledge:** All questions must be based on core concepts taught in a standard first-year university physics curriculum (classical mechanics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, waves, fluids). Questions should not require specialized knowledge beyond this level or rely on obscure formulas or derivations.
* **Complex Reasoning:** Questions should prioritize testing complex reasoning and the synthesis of multiple concepts. They should challenge students to apply their knowledge in novel situations and require them to integrate different areas of physics to arrive at a solution. Avoid questions that can be answered by simply plugging numbers into a single formula.

# STYLE
Questions should be thought-provoking, engaging, and encourage intuitive reasoning. Examples of the desired style:

* "如果月球变成完美球形镜面，在地球上看起来是什么样？"
* "一个倒置的酒瓶猛插入水中，水为什么很难进入？" 
* "两艘船高速并行，是会相互吸引还是排斥？"

# FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES
{few_shot_examples_json_string}

# TASK
Generate a batch of {batch_size} new and unique questions suitable for first-year university physics students. These questions should adhere strictly to the principles and style outlined above. Avoid purely mathematical proofs or derivations, and avoid overly broad, open-ended questions that lack a clearly defined scope. Each question must be accompanied by a detailed standard answer and metadata (topic, difficulty, and question type).

# OUTPUT FORMAT
The output must be a single JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "topic": "Physics topic (e.g., Fluid Dynamics, Thermodynamics, etc.)",
      "difficulty": 1-5,
      "type": "Logical Thinking, Knowledge-based, or Application",
      "question_text": "The complete question text in Chinese",
      "standard_answer": "Detailed explanation of the correct answer in Chinese"
    }
  ]
}
```

Return only valid JSON. Do not include any additional text, explanations, or markdown code blocks.
