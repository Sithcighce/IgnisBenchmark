  "question_text": "How do the chemical stability differences between Cr-based and Al-based MOFs affect their performance and regeneration efficiency in post-combustion CO₂ capture systems, considering the harsh flue gas environment?",
  "standard_answer": "The superior chemical stability of Cr-based MOFs like MIL-101(Cr) compared to Al-based MOFs significantly impacts their performance and regeneration efficiency in post-combustion CO₂ capture. Flue gases from coal-fired power plants contain 73-77% N₂, 15-16% CO₂, 5-7% water vapor, 3-4% O₂, and traces of SOₓ, NOₓ, and hydrochloric acid, creating a very harsh and aggressive environment. MIL-101(Cr) shows extremely high stability when exposed to acidic conditions of pH = 0 and 4, with PXRD patterns showing no changes even after exposure for 2 months. In contrast, NH₂-MIL-101(Al) shows very low stability in acidic conditions and undergoes complete dissolution within minutes at pH = 0. The chemical stability of isotypic MOFs relies on the nature of the central metal ion, where more inert central metal ions like Cr(III) provide higher resistance to degradation. This stability difference directly affects regeneration efficiency - Cr-based MOFs maintain their structural integrity and adsorption capacity through multiple regeneration cycles, while Al-based MOFs degrade rapidly, losing porosity and adsorption performance. The robust framework of Cr-based MOFs allows for consistent temperature swing or pressure swing adsorption regeneration without structural collapse, making them more suitable for long-term industrial CO₂ capture applications where repeated regeneration cycles are required.",

While the original text confirms MIL-101(Cr) shows extremely high stability at pH = 0 and 4, and that chemical stability depends on the central metal ion, it does NOT provide specific information about NH₂-MIL-101(Al)'s dissolution behavior or direct comparisons between Cr-based and Al-based MOFs. The answer presents these as facts when they are not supported by the provided original text. The general principles about Cr(III) being more inert and the flue gas composition are correctly stated, but the specific claims about Al-based MOF performance cannot be verified from the given source material and appear to be added information presented as if it were from the original text.",

The causal link between higher chemical stability and better regeneration performance is logically consistent. However, the specific claim about NH2-MIL-101(Al) rapid dissolution at pH=0 and detailed assertions about TSA/PSA cycle robustness are not directly supported by the provided text, warranting low verification confidence despite overall consistency.",
