  "question_text": "How do preheat temperature and operating pressure affect the laminar flame speed and quenching distance, and what are the combined implications for boundary layer flashback limits?",
  "standard_answer": "Preheat temperature and operating pressure inversely affect laminar flame speed and quenching distance, thereby influencing flashback limits. Increasing preheat temperature raises the reactant thermal energy, accelerating reaction rates and increasing laminar flame speed S_L approximately exponentially. Simultaneously, higher temperature reduces gas density and increases thermal diffusivity, leading to a larger quenching distance d_q as heat loss to the wall becomes less effective. The critical velocity gradient g_c = S_L / d_p (with d_p ∝ d_q) thus increases with preheat, indicating higher flashback propensity. For pressure, S_L decreases with rising pressure for most hydrocarbons (S_L ∝ P^(n-2) with n ~ 1-2), while quenching distance d_q decreases due to higher collision frequencies (d_q ∝ P^(-n/2)). This results in g_c increasing with pressure (g_c ∝ P^(n-1)), making flashback more likely at elevated pressures. The combined effect means that high preheat and high pressure conditions, typical in gas turbines, significantly elevate flashback risk, necessitating careful design to avoid upstream flame propagation.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly explains the effects of preheat temperature and pressure on laminar flame speed and quenching distance, consistent with the original text. For preheat: correctly states S_L increases (matches original text [1]) and explains the mechanism (higher thermal energy, faster reactions). For pressure: correctly states S_L decreases for hydrocarbons with 1<n<2 (matches original text [2]), provides correct scaling relationships (S_L ∝ P^(n-2), d_q ∝ P^(-n/2)), and correctly concludes that critical velocity gradient g_c increases with pressure (matches original text [2]). The physical principles (Arrhenius kinetics, thermal diffusivity, collision frequencies) are sound. The combined implications for flashback risk in gas turbines are logically derived from the established relationships. While the answer is detailed, all statements are factually accurate and no contradictions exist.",
