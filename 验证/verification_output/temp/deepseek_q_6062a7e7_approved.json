  "question_text": "Compare and contrast the carbon deposition mechanisms on Ni/YSZ electrodes in SOFCs when operating with methane versus carbon monoxide fuels, focusing specifically on the morphological differences in carbon formation and the coverage patterns on electrode components as described in the provided literature.",
  "standard_answer": "Carbon deposition on Ni/YSZ electrodes occurs through different mechanisms depending on the fuel composition. When operating with carbon monoxide (CO), carbon forms primarily through the Boudouard reaction (2CO → C + CO2) and covers solely the nickel catalytic sites. The carbon appears as a solid layer that encapsulates the Ni grains without extending to the YSZ surface. In contrast, methane (CH4) leads to carbon formation that covers both nickel and YSZ surfaces, appearing in the form of amorphous carbon. The key distinction lies in the coverage pattern: CO-derived carbon is restricted to Ni sites, while CH4-derived carbon affects both electrode components. This difference in carbon morphology and distribution directly impacts electrode degradation, with methane causing more extensive coverage that can block active sites on both catalytic and ionic conducting phases.",

    "1": "After feeding the cell with CO, carbon covered solely Ni catalytic sites, as a solid layer encapsulating the Ni grains. Carbon from CH4, however, covered both Ni and YSZ and appeared in the form of amorphous carbon.",
    "2": "If we consider the carbon formation from carbon monoxide, the main carbon forming reactions are the Boudouard reaction (Eq. (14)) and reversible steam gasification (Eq. (15))."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects the information from the original text. It correctly states that CO-derived carbon covers only Ni catalytic sites as a solid layer encapsulating Ni grains, while CH4-derived carbon covers both Ni and YSZ surfaces in amorphous form. The answer correctly identifies the Boudouard reaction (2CO → C + CO2) as the main carbon formation mechanism for CO. The distinction between coverage patterns (CO restricted to Ni vs CH4 affecting both components) is accurately presented. The additional context about electrode degradation implications, while not explicitly in the original text, is a reasonable and scientifically sound inference that does not contradict the source material. All factual statements align with the original text and established SOFC science.",
