  "question_text": "Using the characteristic length scales l₁ and l₂ from window-ejected fire plumes, explain how these scales are defined and what physical phenomena they represent in the context of compartment fire dynamics. Discuss how these length scales relate to the outflow characteristics and air entrainment mechanisms of under-ventilated compartment fires.",
  "standard_answer": "The characteristic length scales l₁ and l₂ are fundamental parameters in window-ejected fire plume analysis. l₁ = (AH¹/²)²/⁵ represents the characteristic length parallel to the window and relates to the convective heat flow through the ventilation opening. This scale emerges from the mass flow rate balance where the outflowing hot gas equals the inflowing fresh air (ṁg = ṁa = 0.5A√H), and the convective heat flow rate (Q̇conv = ṁgcpΔTg) at the window. The dimensionless expression Q̇conv/(ρ∞cpT∞√g l₁⁵/²) = 7.54(ΔTg/T∞) indicates l₁'s role in normalizing flame height and convective heat transfer parameters. l₂ = (AH²)¹/⁴ represents the characteristic length normal to the window and captures the horizontal distance before the flow transitions from horizontal to vertical. This scale arises from the competition between momentum flux (M₀ ≈ ṁgvg) and buoyancy flux (J₀ ≈ ṁgΔTg/T∞g) at the window outlet, specifically l₂ ≈ (M₀/ρ∞)³/⁴/(J₀/ρ∞)¹/². Physically, l₁ governs the vertical development and convective heat transfer scaling of the plume, while l₂ determines the flame depth and horizontal extension before buoyancy dominates. These scales collectively describe how the window dimensions (area A, height H) control the initial outflow conditions, with l₁ relating to thermal energy transport and l₂ to the momentum-buoyancy transition that affects air entrainment patterns and flame attachment to the facade.",

The physical interpretations are sound: l₁ relates to convective heat flow and vertical development parallel to the window, while l₂ represents the momentum-buoyancy transition normal to the window. The derivation of l₂ from the ratio (M₀/ρ∞)^(3/4)/(J₀/ρ∞)^(1/2) matches the original text exactly. The mass flow rate balance (ṁg = ṁa = 0.5A√H) and the physical mechanisms described (air entrainment, flame attachment, transition from horizontal to vertical flow) are all consistent with established compartment fire dynamics principles. The answer provides appropriate elaboration beyond the original text without introducing factual errors.",

However, it includes a clearly incorrect and dimensionally inconsistent mass-flow expression (ṁg = ṁa = 0.5 A √H), and leverages it to motivate l1. It also presents an unsupported specific dimensionless constant for convective heat flow. Due to these factual errors, the answer should be marked incorrect despite otherwise accurate definitions and physical interpretation of l1 and l2.",
