  "question_text": "Explain the physical mechanisms by which flame-wall interactions, including heat transfer and radical quenching, influence the burning velocity profile and flashback propensity in boundary layer flashback, focusing specifically on how these mechanisms affect flame behavior near the wall without introducing unsupported quantitative relationships.",
  "standard_answer": "Flame-wall interactions critically affect boundary layer flashback through thermal and chemical quenching mechanisms. Near the wall, heat loss to the cooler surface reduces the local temperature, which slows reaction rates and decreases the burning velocity. Simultaneously, radical species such as H and OH are quenched upon collision with the wall, reducing chain-branching reactions and further suppressing flame propagation. The burning velocity decreases close to the wall due to these combined effects of heat loss and radical quenching. The flame is ultimately quenched at a certain distance from the wall, causing the part of the flame closest to the wall to trail behind the central position. This quenching distance represents the location where reactions cannot sustain themselves, and it varies with factors like fuel composition. For high-hydrogen fuels, the enhanced diffusivity and faster kinetics actually lead to larger quenching distances compared to hydrocarbons, contrary to some common assumptions. These flame-wall interactions create a velocity profile where the burning velocity diminishes near the wall, making the flame more susceptible to flashback when the local flow velocity drops below the diminished burning velocity in the boundary layer region. The critical velocity gradient concept captures this behavior by relating the laminar flame speed to the penetration distance where flow velocity equals burning velocity.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly explains the physical mechanisms of flame-wall interactions in boundary layer flashback. It accurately describes: (1) heat loss to the wall reducing local temperature and reaction rates, (2) radical quenching (H, OH) reducing chain-branching reactions, (3) the combined effect decreasing burning velocity near the wall, and (4) flame quenching at a certain distance causing the flame to trail behind. These points are fully consistent with the original text statements [1] and [2]. The answer provides additional mechanistic detail (e.g., specific radicals, chain-branching reactions, critical velocity gradient concept) that is scientifically accurate and enhances understanding without contradicting the original text. The mention of high-hydrogen fuels having larger quenching distances is a well-established phenomenon in combustion science. No factual errors, logical contradictions, or inconsistencies with the original text were identified.",

        ],
        "reasoning": "The answer correctly captures the core mechanisms from the ground-truth text: near-wall heat loss and radical quenching reduce Sf(y), and the flame is quenched at a finite distance so the near-wall flame front trails. However, it introduces a factual error about quenching distance trends for hydrogen versus hydrocarbons, and it suggests that diminished burning velocity increases flashback susceptibility, which is contrary to the usual effect of reduced Sf(y) (stabilizing for a given flow). Otherwise, the qualitative mention of the critical velocity gradient concept is acceptable.",
