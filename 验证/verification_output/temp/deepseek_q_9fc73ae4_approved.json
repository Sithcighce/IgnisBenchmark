  "question_text": "How does the degree of polymerization (DP) of cellulose influence the yield of levoglucosan during pyrolysis, and what is the underlying chemical mechanism?",
  "standard_answer": "The degree of polymerization (DP) of cellulose significantly affects levoglucosan (LG) yield during pyrolysis due to the role of glycosidic bond cleavage and intramolecular reactions. Higher DP cellulose contains more β-1,4-glycosidic bonds, whose cleavage generates glucosyl cations. These cations can undergo intramolecular nucleophilic attack by the C6 hydroxyl group, forming the stable 1,6-anhydride structure of levoglucosan. As DP increases, the probability of this intramolecular cyclization rises because longer chains provide more sites for cation formation upon bond scission. Additionally, higher DP cellulose has a more extended hydrogen-bonding network, which may stabilize intermediate cations and favor LG formation over fragmentation pathways. Experimentally, LG yield increases from ~8% for glucose (DP=1) to over 54% for high-DP cellulose, demonstrating the direct correlation between chain length and LG production. This mechanism highlights the importance of polymer architecture in controlling pyrolysis product selectivity.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "With increasing DP, the LG yield increased from 8.10% to 54.50%, which indicated a significant correlation between the formation of LG and the cleavage of glycosidic bonds.",
    "2": "They proposed that the cations formed from the cleavage of glycosidic bonds can easily bind to the hydroxyl group at the C6 position of the glucose residue, leading to the formation of LG."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately explains the relationship between cellulose DP and levoglucosan yield. It correctly describes the mechanism involving glycosidic bond cleavage, glucosyl cation formation, and intramolecular nucleophilic attack by the C6 hydroxyl group to form the 1,6-anhydride structure. The quantitative data (LG yield increasing from ~8% for DP=1 to over 54% for high-DP cellulose) matches the original text. The additional mechanistic details about hydrogen-bonding networks and the probability of intramolecular cyclization are reasonable elaborations consistent with polymer chemistry principles and do not contradict the original text. The answer correctly identifies the cause-effect relationship between chain length and LG production.",

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly states that higher DP increases LG yield and attributes this to glycosidic bond cleavage producing cationic intermediates that react with the C6 hydroxyl to form levoglucosan, matching the original text. It accurately reflects the reported trend (≈8% to ≈54%) and provides a consistent mechanistic rationale (transglycosylation/oxocarbenium pathway). Additional comments about more cleavage sites and potential H-bond stabilization are reasonable and not contradictory.",
