  "question_text": "How does the presence of side walls or facing walls constrain air entrainment into window-ejected fire plumes, and what are the resulting effects on flame height and temperature profiles?",
  "standard_answer": "The presence of side walls or facing walls physically restricts the lateral and frontal air entrainment into the window-ejected fire plume, reducing the available perimeter for ambient air to mix with the hot, fuel-rich gases. This constraint alters the entrainment dynamics by limiting the turbulent mixing at the plume boundaries, which is critical for combustion completeness. Reduced entrainment decreases the dilution of unburned fuel and lowers the combustion efficiency, leading to a longer flame height as the plume must travel further vertically to entrain sufficient oxygen for complete combustion. Additionally, the constrained entrainment reduces heat losses to the surroundings, resulting in higher temperatures within the plume due to less convective cooling. The flame becomes more attached to the facade, intensifying heat transfer to adjacent surfaces. Quantitatively, the entrainment restriction can be characterized by dimensionless parameters like K, which accounts for side wall separation distances, and models show that flame height Zf increases under these conditions due to the reduced entrainment coefficient.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "A ‘constrained’ boundary, such as a facing wall [61,76–78] or side walls [10,43,79,80] (in Fig. 2 (a)), reduces the entrainment of air into the fire plume (and the smoke plume above), leading to larger flame heights and increased temperatures.",
    "2": "The fire plume can also be pushed closer to the facade, leading to strongly intensified heat transfer (and thus, in case of a combustible facade, much faster fire spread)."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately explains the mechanisms described in the original text. It correctly states that constrained boundaries (side walls/facing walls) reduce air entrainment, leading to larger flame heights and increased temperatures - directly consistent with the original text. The answer provides additional mechanistic detail (reduced turbulent mixing, lower combustion efficiency, reduced convective cooling) that is physically sound and logically follows from reduced entrainment. The mention of the plume being pushed closer to the facade and intensifying heat transfer is also consistent with the original text. The additional quantitative details about dimensionless parameters and entrainment coefficients, while not in the original text, represent reasonable elaboration of established fire plume theory and do not contradict the source material. All cause-effect relationships are correct and the physical principles are sound.",
