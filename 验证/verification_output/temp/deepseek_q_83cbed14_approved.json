  "question_text": "How does the intrinsic thermoacoustic (ITA) feedback loop generate self-sustained oscillations in combustion systems with anechoic boundary conditions, and what are the critical conditions for instability?",
  "standard_answer": "The ITA feedback loop generates self-sustained oscillations through a localized mechanism where velocity fluctuations upstream of the flame induce heat release rate fluctuations, which in turn produce upstream and downstream traveling acoustic waves. The upstream traveling waves modulate the velocity at the reference position, closing the loop without requiring external acoustic reflections. For anechoic boundaries (Rin = Rout = 0), the characteristic equation reduces to ξ + α + αθF(s) = 0, where ξ is the specific impedance ratio, α is the cross-section ratio, θ is the relative temperature increment, and F(s) is the flame transfer function. Using an n-τ model F(s) = ne^(-sτ), the critical interaction index for neutral stability (σ = 0) is nc = (ξ + α)/(αθ). Instability occurs when n > nc, with the oscillation frequency ω = (2k+1)π/τ for k ∈ N₀. This mechanism explains how thermoacoustic instabilities can persist even in the absence of acoustic cavity modes, as the ITA loop's intrinsic dynamics drive the oscillations.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "In the case of anechoic boundary conditions the upstream and downstream acoustic reflections are zero, which leads to the absence of incoming acoustic waves (fu = gd = 0). In that scenario, the acoustic feedback loop (external blue circuit) ceases to exist. In contrast, the ITA feedback loop (inner orange circuit) not only exists, but may also be unstable.",
    "2": "The critical value of the interaction index can be computed from the neutral stability condition σ = 0. It yields nc = (ξ + α)/(αθ), which corresponds to the results of [2,4]. This expression puts forward the idea that an anechoic system can indeed be unstable for values of the flame response gain beyond a well-defined threshold, n > nc."

Key points verified: (1) Correctly explains that velocity fluctuations upstream induce heat release fluctuations, producing acoustic waves that close the loop without external reflections. (2) Accurately states that for anechoic boundaries (Rin = Rout = 0), the characteristic equation reduces to ξ + α + αθF(s) = 0. (3) Correctly derives the critical interaction index nc = (ξ + α)/(αθ) from neutral stability condition σ = 0, matching the original text and cited references. (4) Properly states instability condition n > nc. (5) Correctly identifies oscillation frequency ω = (2k+1)π/τ for the n-τ model. (6) Accurately concludes that ITA mechanism explains instabilities in absence of acoustic cavity modes. All physical principles, mathematical relationships, and causal logic are sound and consistent with thermoacoustic theory.",

        "reasoning": "The answer aligns with the ground-truth statements: it correctly states that with anechoic boundaries the external acoustic loop vanishes while the ITA loop can still be unstable, and it provides the correct neutral stability threshold nc = (ξ + α)/(αθ) with instability for n > nc. The described loop mechanism (velocity → heat release → traveling waves → velocity) is consistent. The added n–τ frequency condition ω = (2k+1)π/τ logically follows from the stated characteristic equation and does not contradict the original text.",
