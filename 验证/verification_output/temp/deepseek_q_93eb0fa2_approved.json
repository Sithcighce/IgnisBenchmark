  "standard_answer": "Concentration overpotentials in porous SOC electrodes develop due to mass transport limitations that create reactant concentration gradients from bulk gas channels to active reaction sites. As described in the paper, 'Concentration overpotential arises from mass transport limitations that create reactant concentration gradients from bulk gas channels to active reaction sites in porous electrodes.' This phenomenon becomes particularly significant at high current densities where reactant consumption accelerates, leading to steep concentration gradients. The relationship between mass transport and polarization curves is clearly established: 'For solid oxide cells, the low, intermediate and high current-density regions are frequently referred to as activation, ohmic and concentration areas where losses are primarily due to charge-transfer kinetics, electrical resistance and mass transport, respectively.' In the concentration region of the polarization curve, mass transport limitations dominate the performance losses as reactant diffusion through the porous electrode structure cannot keep pace with the electrochemical reaction rates. The development of concentration overpotentials is influenced by the electrode microstructure, including porosity and tortuosity, which affect gas transport pathways. As current density increases towards limiting conditions, the concentration at reaction sites approaches zero, leading to significant voltage losses that manifest as the characteristic steep drop in the high current density portion of polarization curves.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately explains concentration overpotentials in porous SOC electrodes and correctly describes the relationship between mass transport limitations and polarization curve regions. It directly quotes and properly contextualizes both key passages from the original text. The answer correctly states that concentration overpotentials arise from mass transport limitations creating reactant concentration gradients, and accurately describes the three regions of polarization curves (activation, ohmic, and concentration). The additional explanations about high current density effects, microstructure influence (porosity and tortuosity), and the characteristic steep drop in voltage are all consistent with established SOC science and do not contradict the original text. The cause-effect relationships are logically sound, and the physical principles are correctly stated.",
