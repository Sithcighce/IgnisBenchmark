  "question_text": "How do pyrolysis temperature and residence time affect the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in tyre pyrolysis oil, and what are the implications for particulate matter emissions during combustion in compression-ignition engines?",
  "standard_answer": "Pyrolysis temperature and residence time significantly influence PAH formation in tyre pyrolysis oil through secondary reactions of aromatic compounds. Higher temperatures and longer residence times promote aromatization reactions where benzene derivatives undergo further transformations into more complex polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. During the second stage of pyrolysis, benzene and its derivatives undergo further reactions to form more aromatic compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) [56], which are problematic from the point of view of exhaust emissions. The favourable conditions for aliphatic compounds aromatization to PAHs are high temperatures and residence time [58]. When TPO containing elevated PAH levels is combusted in compression-ignition engines, these compounds act as precursors for particulate matter formation. The high aromatic content, particularly PAHs, contributes to increased soot nucleation and growth during combustion, leading to elevated particulate matter emissions. This poses challenges for meeting stringent emission standards, especially in automotive applications where particulate matter limits are strictly regulated. Consequently, controlling pyrolysis conditions to minimize PAH formation is essential for reducing engine-out particulate emissions and improving compliance with emission regulations.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects the information from the original text and applies sound combustion science principles. It correctly states that: (1) higher temperatures and longer residence times promote PAH formation through aromatization reactions, which directly matches the original text; (2) benzene derivatives undergo transformations to form PAHs during the second stage of pyrolysis, consistent with the original text; (3) the logical extension to combustion implications (PAHs acting as soot precursors, leading to increased particulate matter emissions) is scientifically sound and follows established combustion theory. The answer appropriately addresses the question's two parts: the effect of pyrolysis conditions on PAH formation and the implications for PM emissions in CI engines. While more detailed than the original text excerpts, all additional explanations are factually correct and logically consistent with combustion science principles.",
