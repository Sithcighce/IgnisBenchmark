  "question_text": "How does the lignin content in lignocellulosic biomass affect the yield and composition of bio-oil during liquefaction, and what mechanistic steps lead to residue formation?",
  "standard_answer": "Higher lignin content in lignocellulosic biomass reduces bio-oil yield and increases solid residue formation during liquefaction. This occurs because lignin decomposes into highly reactive phenoxy radicals under liquefaction conditions (250–400°C). These radicals undergo condensation and repolymerization reactions, forming char-like solid residues rather than contributing to bio-oil production. The mechanistic steps involve: (1) Depolymerization of lignin into phenoxy radicals; (2) Condensation of these radicals through radical-radical coupling; (3) Repolymerization of the condensed species into solid residue. This mechanism explains why feedstocks with higher lignin content consistently show lower conversion rates and bio-oil yields, as the lignin-derived compounds are more prone to forming solid residues through secondary reactions compared to carbohydrate-derived components.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "The higher the lignin content in the feedstock, the lower the conversion rate and bio-oil yield.",
    "2": "It was thought that the phenoxy radicals could be formed from the lignin in a hot state, and they were able to condense and repolymerize to a solid mass. Therefore, higher lignin content resulted in a higher residue yield by condensation and repolymerization."

Key points verified: (1) Higher lignin content reduces bio-oil yield and increases residue formation - consistent with original text; (2) Temperature range (250-400°C) is appropriate for liquefaction conditions; (3) Phenoxy radical formation from lignin decomposition matches the original text; (4) The three-step mechanism (depolymerization → condensation → repolymerization) correctly elaborates on the condensation and repolymerization process mentioned in the original text; (5) The explanation of why lignin-derived compounds form solid residues rather than bio-oil is logically sound and consistent with the radical chemistry described. The answer provides additional mechanistic detail beyond the original text, but all additions are scientifically accurate and consistent with established lignin chemistry during thermochemical conversion.",
