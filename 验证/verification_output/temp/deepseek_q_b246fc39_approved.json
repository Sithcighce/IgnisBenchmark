  "question_text": "How do spontaneous flame topology transitions between V-shape and M-shape configurations in swirl combustors represent Type III-A extreme events, and what dynamical systems characteristics enable these intermittent transitions?",
  "standard_answer": "Spontaneous flame topology transitions in swirl combustors exemplify Type III-A extreme events because they occur as intrinsic features of the system's attracting set without external triggers. The V-shape and M-shape configurations represent different regions within the same attractor where the system naturally visits during its long-term evolution. These transitions arise from the nonlinear coupling between swirling flow dynamics, flame stabilization mechanisms, and heat release feedback. The attractor contains pathological subspaces where small perturbations in the recirculation zone dynamics or local equivalence ratio cause the flame to switch between stabilization patterns. The intermittent nature stems from the chaotic dynamics of turbulent swirling flows, where the system periodically visits regions of phase space corresponding to different flame topologies. This spontaneous switching between configurations represents an extreme event because each transition exposes combustor walls to different heat flux distributions, potentially causing thermal stress and durability issues. The fact that these transitions occur without changes in operating conditions demonstrates they are inherent to the system dynamics rather than driven by external parameters.",

    "1": "Type III-A: Spontaneous bursts - Here, the QoI exhibits intermittent bursts that are periodically encountered, with a non-fixed period, and characterize the long-term behavior of the system. In other terms, these extreme events are naturally encountered by the system as they are part of the underlying dynamics.",
    "2": "Premixed combustors can exhibit macroscopic transitions that can be categorized as spontaneous bursts. At fuel-lean conditions, the flame front can, for example, oscillate between 'V'- and 'M'-shapes. Such transitions can be detrimental to the efficiency and the durability of the combustor."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly characterizes the flame topology transitions as Type III-A extreme events, accurately explaining that they are intrinsic features of the system's attracting set occurring without external triggers, consistent with the original text's definition. The answer correctly identifies that V-shape and M-shape configurations represent different regions within the same attractor and that transitions occur spontaneously during long-term evolution. The explanation of underlying mechanisms (nonlinear coupling between swirling flow dynamics, flame stabilization, and heat release feedback) is physically sound and consistent with combustion science principles. The characterization of intermittent nature stemming from chaotic turbulent dynamics is appropriate. The answer correctly notes these are extreme events due to their impact (different heat flux distributions causing thermal stress), which aligns with the original text's mention of detriment to efficiency and durability. All physical principles stated are correct, and the reasoning is logically consistent throughout.",
