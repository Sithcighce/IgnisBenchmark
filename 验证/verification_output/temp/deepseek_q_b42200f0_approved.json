  "question_text": "What are the key differences between the resolved particle approach and point particle approach in char conversion modeling, and under what specific conditions is each method most appropriate?",
  "standard_answer": "The resolved particle approach and point particle approach represent fundamentally different methodologies for char conversion modeling with distinct advantages and limitations. In the resolved particle approach, both the char particle and surrounding boundary layer are fully resolved on the computational grid, allowing direct calculation of heat, mass, and momentum transfer without relying on sub-models. This method accurately captures internal temperature and concentration gradients, heterogeneous reactions on internal surfaces, and detailed boundary layer phenomena including homogeneous reactions. However, it is computationally expensive and typically limited to small numbers of particles. Conversely, the point particle approach treats particles as infinitesimal points in the flow field, requiring sub-models for all coupling between solid and fluid phases including heat, mass, and momentum transfer. This approach is computationally efficient and suitable for simulating large numbers of particles but relies on simplified models that may not capture complex internal phenomena. The resolved approach is most appropriate for: (1) large particles with significant internal gradients (high Biot numbers), (2) cases requiring detailed heterogeneous kinetics with internal surface reactions, (3) studies of fundamental phenomena where accuracy is paramount, and (4) particles where boundary layer homogeneous reactions are important. The point particle approach is preferred for: (1) pulverized fuel applications with billions of micrometer-sized particles, (2) industrial-scale simulations where computational efficiency is critical, (3) particles with small Biot numbers where internal gradients are negligible, and (4) cases where statistical particle behavior rather than individual particle details is of interest. The physical distinction lies in how each method handles the solid-fluid coupling: resolved approaches solve the governing equations directly at the interface, while point approaches use empirical correlations.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "In the resolved approach, both the char particle itself and the surrounding boundary layer is resolved. This means that heat, mass and momentum transfer are accurately handled.",
    "2": "For the point particle approach, which is computationally much cheaper, one has to rely on suitable models to estimate for example the heat, mass and momentum transfer. This approach is commonly referred to as the 'point-particle approach' since as far as the fluid solver is concerned, the particles are treated as infinitely small points that do not occupy any volume."
