  "question_text": "How does coke formation during selective ring-opening (SRO) deactivate catalysts, and what catalyst design strategies mitigate this based on the provided paper?",
  "standard_answer": "Coke formation deactivates SRO catalysts by depositing heavy hydrocarbon species on active sites and blocking pore access, which reduces catalyst efficiency. The paper states: 'The latter has a considerable influence on the efficiency of SRO due to the formation and deposition of heavy hydrocarbon species over the active sites of the catalyst and blocking pore access.' To mitigate coke formation, catalyst design should focus on limiting acidity, as 'Suitable SRO catalysts require limited acidity to prevent overcracking and isomerization reactions; this can limit coke formation reactions in favor of a more durable and stable performance.' This approach reduces strong acid sites that promote coking reactions, enhancing catalyst stability during SRO operations.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately explains both mechanisms of catalyst deactivation and mitigation strategies. It correctly identifies that coke formation deactivates catalysts through (1) deposition on active sites and (2) blocking pore access, which directly matches the original text. The mitigation strategy of limiting catalyst acidity to prevent overcracking and isomerization is also accurately stated, with proper quotation from the source. The cause-effect relationships are logically sound: limited acidity → reduced overcracking/isomerization → reduced coke formation → improved catalyst stability. All physical and chemical principles are correctly applied, and there are no contradictions with the original text.",
