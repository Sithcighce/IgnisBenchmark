  "question_text": "Calculate the alkali index (AI) for a biomass fuel with 0.5 kg K2O and 0.1 kg Na2O per 1000 kg fuel and a heating value of 15 MJ/kg, and explain how this index correlates with slagging propensity based on established thresholds.",
  "standard_answer": "To calculate the alkali index (AI), use the formula AI = (mass of K2O + mass of Na2O in kg) / heating value in GJ. First, determine the total alkali mass: 0.5 kg K2O + 0.1 kg Na2O = 0.6 kg. The heating value is 15 MJ/kg, so for 1000 kg fuel, total energy = 1000 kg × 15 MJ/kg = 15,000 MJ = 15 GJ. Thus, AI = 0.6 kg / 15 GJ = 0.04 kg/GJ. According to Davidsson et al., slagging is probable when AI is between 0.17–0.34 kg/GJ and almost certain above that. Here, AI = 0.04 kg/GJ is below the probable range, indicating low slagging propensity. This correlation arises because higher AI values signify more alkali metals available to form low-melting compounds like chlorides and sulfates, which condense on surfaces and promote deposit growth. The index helps in fuel selection and additive use to manage slagging risks.",

    "1": "Davidsson et al. estimated the extent of biomass slagging through the alkali index (AI = kg(K2O + Na2O)/GJ) that is used for the evaluation of coal slagging. Slagging is probable when the AI is in the range 0.17–0.34 kg GJ−1 and is almost certain at greater value.",
    "2": "Alkali-induced slagging is mainly associated with alkali metals, especially alkali chlorides and sulfates."

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly calculates the alkali index using the formula AI = (K2O + Na2O in kg) / heating value in GJ. The calculation is accurate: 0.6 kg / 15 GJ = 0.04 kg/GJ. The interpretation correctly applies the Davidsson et al. thresholds (0.17-0.34 kg/GJ for probable slagging, higher for almost certain), concluding that 0.04 kg/GJ indicates low slagging propensity. The mechanistic explanation about alkali metals forming low-melting compounds (chlorides and sulfates) that promote deposit growth is consistent with the original text stating 'Alkali-induced slagging is mainly associated with alkali metals, especially alkali chlorides and sulfates.' All physical principles, calculations, and interpretations are correct and consistent with the original text.",
