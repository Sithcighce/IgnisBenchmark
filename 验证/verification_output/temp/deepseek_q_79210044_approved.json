  "question_text": "How does the flame-adapted coordinate system enable resolution of strong stretch effects in turbulent premixed flames, and what advantages does this provide over weak stretch theories?",
  "standard_answer": "The flame-adapted coordinate system resolves strong stretch effects by transforming the governing equations to a curvilinear system where coordinate surfaces align with progress variable iso-contours and coordinate lines follow flamelet paths orthogonal to these surfaces. This transformation allows explicit resolution of stretch rate K(s) and area element σ(s) variations throughout the flame thickness, rather than assuming homogeneous perturbations as in weak stretch theories. The key advantages are: (1) ability to handle Karlovitz numbers Ka ~ 1 where turbulent eddies are comparable to flame thickness (η ~ δ_f), (2) incorporation of realistic multi-species transport and chemistry without large activation energy assumptions, (3) resolution of curvature effects throughout the diffusive layer, and (4) accurate prediction of local mass burning rate variations due to stretch and preferential diffusion. Weak stretch theories assume perturbations are homogeneous on flame scales (η >> δ_f) and are limited to single-step chemistry with large activation energy, making them unreliable for practical turbulent combustion where small-scale turbulence directly interacts with flame structure.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "The main difference between the existing weak stretch theories and our strong stretch theory is that we will not assume that δ_f→0 thus we cannot treat the flame as an interface as in other models.",
    "2": "In the regime with η ≈ δ_f and δ_r→0, it is obvious that the flow perturbations cannot be assumed homogeneous inside the diffusive layer."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly explains the flame-adapted coordinate system and its advantages over weak stretch theories. It accurately states that strong stretch theory does not assume δ_f→0 (consistent with original text [1]), and correctly identifies that flow perturbations cannot be assumed homogeneous inside the diffusive layer when η ≈ δ_f (consistent with original text [2]). The answer provides accurate physical descriptions of the coordinate transformation, stretch rate resolution, and the limitations of weak stretch theories (η >> δ_f assumption, single-step chemistry with large activation energy). The four key advantages listed are logically sound and consistent with combustion science principles. While the answer is detailed and goes beyond the minimal original text, all statements are factually accurate and there are no contradictions with the ground truth.",

It reasonably elaborates on advantages over weak stretch approaches (e.g., Ka ~ 1 regime, curvature, preferential diffusion, multi-species transport), with no factual or logical contradictions.",
