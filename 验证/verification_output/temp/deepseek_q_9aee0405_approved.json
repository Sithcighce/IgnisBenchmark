  "question_text": "How do ion-exchange membranes influence the performance of continuous-flow CO2 electrolyzers, particularly in terms of cell resistance and product distribution? Explain the mechanisms behind these effects using the provided paper content.",
  "standard_answer": "Ion-exchange membranes in continuous-flow CO2 electrolyzers serve to separate the anode and cathode compartments, preventing product crossover and enabling independent optimization of half-cell conditions. The paper highlights that including a buffer layer between electrodes can mitigate issues like catholyte acidification but simultaneously increases cell resistance, as stated: 'Including a buffer layer between the electrodes can circumvent this effect, but at the same time, leads to increased cell resistance [51].' This resistance increase arises because additional layers impede ion transport, elevating ohmic losses and reducing energy efficiency. Furthermore, the type of membrane significantly affects product distribution. For instance, anion exchange membranes transport hydroxide ions (OH⁻) instead of protons, altering reaction pathways: 'In such arrangements, OH⁻ ions are transported through the membrane, which results in a different product distribution compared to cation exchange membrane containing systems [52].' This shift occurs because hydroxide transport maintains a higher local pH at the cathode, which can suppress hydrogen evolution and favor CO2 reduction products like CO or formate by stabilizing intermediates. In contrast, cation exchange membranes (e.g., Nafion) facilitate proton transport, potentially acidifying the catholyte and promoting competitive hydrogen evolution. Thus, membrane selection directly impacts both electrochemical efficiency (via resistance) and selectivity (via ion-specific transport mechanisms), requiring careful optimization for scalable CO2 electrolysis systems.",

        "reasoning": "The answer accurately explains how ion-exchange membranes influence CO2 electrolyzer performance. It correctly cites that buffer layers increase cell resistance (matching original text [1]) and explains the mechanism (impeded ion transport, elevated ohmic losses). It accurately describes how anion exchange membranes transport OH⁻ ions leading to different product distributions compared to cation exchange membranes (matching original text [2]). The mechanistic explanations are scientifically sound: higher local pH from OH⁻ transport suppressing hydrogen evolution and favoring CO2 reduction, while proton transport in cation exchange membranes can acidify catholyte and promote hydrogen evolution. All physical and electrochemical principles stated are correct, with no contradictions to the original text. The answer provides appropriate elaboration beyond the original text that is consistent with established electrochemistry principles.",
