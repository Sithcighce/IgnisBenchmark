  "question_text": "What is the role of 'back-support' from pilot flames in preventing local extinction and maintaining flamelet integrity under extreme turbulence conditions?",
  "standard_answer": "Back-support from pilot flames plays a critical role in maintaining flamelet integrity by providing a hot, reactive environment that surrounds the main flame, preventing the entrainment of cold ambient air into the products. This hot pilot gas ensures that the temperature in the product region remains high, which sustains chemical reactions and reduces the likelihood of local extinction events. Under extreme turbulence, large-scale motions can entrain cold gas, leading to increased heat losses and potential quenching of reaction zones. The pilot flame counteracts this by supplying additional heat and radicals, effectively 'supporting' the main flame from behind. This back-support stabilizes the flame structure, allowing state relations (conditional mean profiles) to remain similar to laminar flames, even when preheat layers are broadened. Without adequate back-support, cold gas entrainment can cause broken reaction layers and deviations from flamelet behavior, as the chemical timescales may not adjust quickly enough to the turbulent fluctuations.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "The hot product gases from the pilot provide what is called 'back-support'. The hot pilot gas surrounds the products from the main flame to prevent cold room air from being entrained.",
    "2": "broken reactions occur if the 'back-support' is insufficient due to the entrainment of cold gas into the product gas."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately explains the back-support mechanism from pilot flames. It correctly states that: (1) hot pilot gas surrounds products to prevent cold air entrainment, (2) this maintains high temperatures and sustains chemical reactions, (3) insufficient back-support leads to broken reaction layers due to cold gas entrainment. The answer provides additional valid context about turbulence effects, heat/radical supply, and flamelet behavior that is consistent with combustion science principles and does not contradict the original text. The elaboration on mechanisms (temperature maintenance, radical supply, state relations) represents reasonable extension of the core concept without introducing factual errors.",
