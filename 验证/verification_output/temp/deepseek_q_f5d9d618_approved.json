  "question_text": "According to the paper, how do aromatic molecular structures influence sooting tendency in combustion, and what are the typical PAH precursors formed from aromatic hydrocarbons? Explain the relationship between aromatic ring structures and sooting tendency based on the provided citations.",
  "standard_answer": "The paper states that 'aromatic ring makes high sooting tendency in the combustion of aromatic hydrocarbons, which can be explained by the increasing production of typical PAH precursors, such as benzyl, styrene, indenyl.' This indicates that the stable aromatic ring structure inherently promotes higher soot formation during combustion compared to non-aromatic hydrocarbons. The increased sooting tendency is directly linked to the enhanced production of specific PAH precursors including benzyl, styrene, and indenyl radicals. These precursors serve as building blocks for larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon structures that ultimately lead to soot formation. The paper further emphasizes that 'PAH formation is one of the most critical subjects in the combustion of aromatics,' highlighting the importance of understanding these precursor formation pathways in aromatic combustion chemistry. The relationship between aromatic structures and sooting tendency is fundamental to predicting pollutant emissions from combustion systems containing aromatic hydrocarbons.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects the original text and correctly explains the relationship between aromatic structures and sooting tendency. It properly identifies that aromatic rings promote high sooting tendency, correctly lists the PAH precursors (benzyl, styrene, indenyl), and accurately describes their role as building blocks for larger PAH structures leading to soot formation. The answer correctly quotes both key statements from the original text and provides sound logical connections between aromatic ring structures, PAH precursor formation, and soot production. The additional context about predicting pollutant emissions is a reasonable extension that doesn't contradict the source material. All chemical principles and cause-effect relationships are correctly stated.",
