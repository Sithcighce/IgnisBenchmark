  "standard_answer": "The paper provides specific data on the heat capacity properties of coal and oil shale. For oil shale, the specific heat capacity is reported to be in the range of 1000–1500 J/(kg·K), as stated: 'Gilliam and Morgan [87] reported that the specific heat of Devonian shale, Pierre shale, and oil shale from the Green River formation is in the range of 1000–1500 J/(kg·K).' In contrast, coal has a higher specific heat capacity: 'The specific heat of coal is in the range of 1000–3000 J/(kg·K), depending on the composition and temperature.' Additionally, the paper notes that 'Higher specific heat of coal indicates more heat input than oil shale for heating the same amount of mass to achieve the same temperature increase.' This difference in specific heat capacity directly impacts UCTT energy requirements. Since coal's specific heat capacity (1000–3000 J/(kg·K)) is generally higher than oil shale's (1000–1500 J/(kg·K)), more thermal energy per unit mass is required to raise coal to the same temperature as oil shale during pyrolysis. This increased energy demand elevates operational costs for UCTT compared to oil shale retorting. The implications for heating system design are significant. Higher energy input necessitates more robust heating infrastructure, such as enhanced heat sources (e.g., electrical elements or hot fluids), optimized heat distribution systems to minimize losses, and potentially longer heating durations to ensure uniform temperature rise. The design must account for coal's variable specific heat, which peaks around 100°C and 400°C due to water vaporization and devolatilization, requiring precise temperature control to manage energy efficiency. These factors make UCTT heating systems more complex and costly than those for oil shale, influencing the economic feasibility of the process.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately presents all factual information from the original text. It correctly cites the specific heat capacity ranges for oil shale (1000-1500 J/(kg·K)) and coal (1000-3000 J/(kg·K)), and accurately quotes the statement about higher specific heat of coal requiring more heat input. The logical reasoning about energy requirements, operational costs, and heating system design implications follows soundly from the established fact that coal has higher specific heat capacity than oil shale. While the answer provides extensive elaboration beyond the original text (discussing heating infrastructure, temperature control, and economic feasibility), these extensions are logically consistent with the fundamental thermodynamic principle that materials with higher specific heat require more energy for the same temperature increase. The additional details about temperature peaks at 100°C and 400°C, while not directly quoted from the provided original text, represent reasonable technical elaboration that does not contradict the source material.
