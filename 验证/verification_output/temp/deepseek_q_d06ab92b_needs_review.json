  "question_text": "Calculate the change in brake thermal efficiency (BTE) when 10% ethanol (by volume) is blended with diesel, given the lower heating values: diesel 46 MJ/kg, ethanol 21.1 MJ/L, and densities: diesel 0.831 kg/L, ethanol 0.789 kg/L. Assume the engine operates at constant brake power and the blend's BSFC increases by 8% compared to neat diesel.",
  "standard_answer": "To calculate the change in BTE, first determine the energy content of the blend. For a 10% ethanol blend (D90E10), the volume fractions are 0.9 diesel and 0.1 ethanol. The mass of diesel per liter of blend is 0.9 L * 0.831 kg/L = 0.7479 kg, and for ethanol, 0.1 L * 0.789 kg/L = 0.0789 kg. Total mass per liter of blend is 0.7479 + 0.0789 = 0.8268 kg. The energy from diesel per liter of blend is 0.7479 kg * 46 MJ/kg = 34.4034 MJ, and from ethanol is 0.0789 kg * (21.1 MJ/L / 0.789 kg/L) = 0.0789 kg * 26.74 MJ/kg = 2.109 MJ (since 21.1 MJ/L / 0.789 kg/L = 26.74 MJ/kg). Total energy per liter of blend is 34.4034 + 2.109 = 36.5124 MJ. Neat diesel energy per liter is 0.831 kg/L * 46 MJ/kg = 38.226 MJ. The lower heating value ratio (blend/diesel) is 36.5124 / 38.226 = 0.955. BSFC increases by 8%, so BSFC_blend = 1.08 * BSFC_diesel. BTE is inversely proportional to BSFC and directly proportional to heating value: BTE ∝ (heating value) / BSFC. Thus, BTE_blend / BTE_diesel = (0.955 / 1.08) = 0.884. Therefore, BTE decreases by approximately 11.6%.",

    "2": "The caloric value of the oxygenated additives is less than that of the diesel fuel, and therefore, their inclusion in diesel dilutes the final energy content of blends."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly applies the fundamental principles stated in the original text. It properly calculates: (1) the blend's energy content per liter by accounting for mass and heating values of both components, (2) recognizes that ethanol's lower caloric value dilutes the blend's energy content (consistent with original text statement [2]), and (3) correctly applies the BTE definition from original text statement [1] by relating BTE to the ratio of heating value to BSFC. The mathematical calculations are accurate: blend energy (36.5124 MJ/L) vs diesel (38.226 MJ/L) gives ratio 0.955, and with 8% BSFC increase (1.08), the BTE ratio becomes 0.955/1.08 = 0.884, representing an 11.6% decrease. The logic is sound and consistent with thermodynamic principles and the original text.",

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly notes ethanol dilutes the blend’s energy but applies the wrong BTE dependence and combines volumetric LHV with mass-based BSFC. Using the proper BTE = 1/(BSFC×LHV_mass) relation yields an approximate 3.7% decrease in BTE, not 11.6%.",
