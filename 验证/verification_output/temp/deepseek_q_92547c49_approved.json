  "question_text": "In TZFBR membrane reactors (TZFBR+MB), how does hydrogen permeation through selective membranes affect local fluidization conditions, and what are the specific defluidization risks and membrane durability challenges mentioned in the paper?",
  "standard_answer": "In TZFBR+MB configurations, hydrogen permeation through selective membranes creates a gas sink effect that reduces local gas velocity in specific bed regions. This velocity reduction can cause defluidization where the relative gas velocity falls below the minimum fluidization threshold, particularly near reactor walls or at transition zones between sections. The paper specifically states: 'Extracting a high product flow through the membrane could significantly lead to defluidization in certain sections of the solid bed, such as near the reactor wall or at the transition between zones, especially where the relative gas velocity might fall below one.' Additionally, membrane durability presents significant operational challenges due to particle attrition from circulating catalyst. The paper notes: 'However, one significant drawback of using membranes in FBRs is their fragility, as they can be damaged by high temperatures, certain chemical substances, or the attrition caused by the movement of the catalyst.' These factors create a critical trade-off where increased hydrogen removal enhances conversion through equilibrium shifting but simultaneously increases defluidization risk and membrane failure probability, requiring careful optimization of permeation rates to maintain stable fluidization while protecting membrane integrity.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately explains the mechanisms described in the original text. It correctly identifies: (1) the gas sink effect from hydrogen permeation reducing local gas velocity, (2) the defluidization risk when velocity falls below minimum fluidization threshold, particularly near reactor walls and transition zones, (3) membrane fragility issues from high temperatures, chemical substances, and catalyst attrition, and (4) the trade-off between enhanced conversion and operational risks. All direct quotes match the original text exactly. The answer provides sound logical connections between hydrogen removal, equilibrium shifting, and the competing effects on reactor performance. The physical principles regarding fluidization and membrane durability are correctly stated and consistent with established combustion science and reactor engineering principles.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects the original text: high product (hydrogen) withdrawal through membranes can lower local gas velocity and cause defluidization, notably near walls and zone transitions when relative velocity drops below one. It correctly identifies membrane fragility due to high temperature, chemical exposure, and catalyst attrition. The added explanation of a local gas sink and equilibrium shifting is consistent with established membrane reactor principles and does not contradict the source.",
