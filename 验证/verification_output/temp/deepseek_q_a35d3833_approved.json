  "question_text": "Calculate the Doppler shift in linecenter frequency for a CO transition at 2150 cm⁻¹ in a scramjet flow at 2500 K with a velocity of 1500 m/s, and explain how this shift is used with multiple beams to determine flow velocity.",
  "standard_answer": "The Doppler shift Δν for a single beam is given by Δν = ν_0 (U cosθ)/c, where ν_0 = 2150 cm⁻¹ = 6.445×10^13 Hz (since 1 cm⁻¹ = 2.998×10^10 Hz), U = 1500 m/s, θ is the angle between the beam and flow direction, and c = 3×10^8 m/s. For a beam at θ = 45°, cos45° = 0.7071, so Δν = (6.445×10^13) × (1500 × 0.7071) / (3×10^8) = 2.28×10^8 Hz = 0.0076 cm⁻¹. In practice, two beams are used: one upstream (θ = 45°) and one downstream (θ = 135°, cos135° = -0.7071). The upstream shift is +0.0076 cm⁻¹, and the downstream shift is -0.0076 cm⁻¹, giving a differential shift Δν_diff = 0.0152 cm⁻¹. The velocity is then calculated as U = (Δν_diff / ν_0) × (c / (2 sin45°)) = (0.0152 / 2150) × (3×10^8 / 1.414) = 1500 m/s. This method eliminates the need to know the absolute linecenter and compensates for thermal broadening, enabling accurate velocity measurements in high-speed flows like scramjets.",

    "2": "U = (Δν_diff / ν_0) × (c / (2 sin(45°)))",
    "3": "this is typically done using two laser beams, e.g., angled at 45° and 135° relative to the flow (i.e., one directed upstream and one downstream), to enable use of the differential Doppler-shift (Δν_diff)."
