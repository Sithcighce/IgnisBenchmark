  "question_text": "How do Pd-Cu and Pd-Au alloy membranes demonstrate enhanced sulfur resistance compared to pure Pd membranes in hydrogen separation applications, and what are the key differences in their recovery behavior after sulfur exposure?",
  "standard_answer": "Pd-Cu and Pd-Au alloy membranes show improved sulfur resistance compared to pure Pd membranes through different mechanisms. The Pd-Cu alloy achieves higher tolerance against sulfur contamination, with permeability similar or slightly lower than that of pure Pd. For Pd-Au alloy membranes with low Au compositions (<10 wt%), enhanced sulfur resistance is demonstrated through different recovery characteristics. When exposed to 55 ppm H2S, hydrogen permeation through Pd-Au membranes drops to 15% of the initial flux but recovers to 65% with hydrogen purging. In contrast, hydrogen permeation through a pure Pd membrane is reduced to 7% under the same H2S concentration without recovery after 20 hours of purging under hydrogen. This indicates that alloying modifies the membrane's interaction with sulfur compounds, reducing irreversible poisoning effects and enabling partial recovery through hydrogen purging treatments.",

    "2": "Pd-Au alloy membranes with low Au compositions (<10 wt%) have also exhibited enhanced sulfur resistance. The hydrogen permeation dropped to 15% of the initial flux at 55 ppm H2S, but soon recovered to 65% with hydrogen purging, whereas the hydrogen permeation through a pure Pd membrane was reduced to 7% under the same H2S concentration without recovery after 20 hours of purging under hydrogen."
