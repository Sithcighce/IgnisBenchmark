  "question_text": "Based on the provided paper excerpt, explain the detailed mechanisms of injector deposit formation in GDI engines through the two distinct free radical pathways, including the specific chemical reactions involved and how temperature regimes influence these mechanisms. Your explanation should include the formation of specific chemical species and the temperature threshold that distinguishes between the two pathways.",
  "standard_answer": "According to the research paper, GDI injector deposits are primarily fuel-derived and created through two distinct free radical pathways: low temperature auto-oxidation and high temperature pyrolysis. The liquid oxidation reactions of alkyl radicals generating hydro-peroxides and other oxidized products are believed to be responsible for deposit formation through the auto-oxidation pathway. At a temperature higher than 350°C, carbon deposits are usually formed by two different routes: (1) decomposition of hydrocarbons to elemental carbon and hydrogen; and (2) polymerization/condensation of hydrocarbon species to larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which then nucleate and grow to become carbonaceous deposits. The temperature threshold of 350°C serves as the distinguishing point between these two mechanisms, with auto-oxidation dominating at lower temperatures and pyrolysis becoming significant above this threshold. The formation of hydro-peroxides through alkyl radical oxidation represents the key chemical reaction in the low-temperature pathway, while the high-temperature pathway involves both direct decomposition to elemental carbon and the complex polymerization process leading to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon formation and subsequent carbonaceous deposit growth.",
