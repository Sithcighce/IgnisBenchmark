  "question_text": "Calculate the equilibrium constant for the water-gas shift reaction at 400°C using the given correlation KP = exp[(4577.8/T) - 4.33], and determine the theoretical CO conversion if the initial steam-to-CO molar ratio is 3:1 at 1 bar pressure.",
  "standard_answer": "First, convert temperature to Kelvin: T = 400 + 273 = 673 K. Substitute into the equation: KP = exp[(4577.8/673) - 4.33] = exp[6.80 - 4.33] = exp[2.47] ≈ 11.82. For the reaction CO + H2O ↔ H2 + CO2, define initial moles: CO = 1, H2O = 3, H2 = 0, CO2 = 0. Let x be the moles of CO converted. At equilibrium: CO = 1-x, H2O = 3-x, H2 = x, CO2 = x. Total moles = 4. The equilibrium constant KP = (P_H2 * P_CO2) / (P_CO * P_H2O) = [(x/4)*(x/4)] / [((1-x)/4)*((3-x)/4)] * P^2, but since pressure P = 1 bar, KP = [x^2] / [(1-x)(3-x)]. Solve 11.82 = x^2 / [(1-x)(3-x)]. Rearranging: 11.82(1-x)(3-x) = x^2 → 11.82(3 - 4x + x^2) = x^2 → 35.46 - 47.28x + 11.82x^2 = x^2 → 10.82x^2 - 47.28x + 35.46 = 0. Using quadratic formula: x = [47.28 ± sqrt(47.28^2 - 4*10.82*35.46)] / (2*10.82) = [47.28 ± sqrt(2234.4 - 1533.5)] / 21.64 = [47.28 ± sqrt(700.9)] / 21.64 = [47.28 ± 26.47] / 21.64. Taking the feasible root (x < 1): x = (47.28 - 26.47)/21.64 ≈ 20.81/21.64 ≈ 0.961. Thus, CO conversion = x/1 = 96.1%.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly applies the given correlation to calculate KP at 400°C (673 K), obtaining KP ≈ 11.82. The equilibrium analysis for the water-gas shift reaction is properly set up with correct stoichiometry and initial conditions (CO:H2O = 1:3). The derivation of the equilibrium expression KP = x²/[(1-x)(3-x)] is correct for the given conditions at 1 bar total pressure. The quadratic equation is properly formulated and solved, yielding x ≈ 0.961 or 96.1% CO conversion. All mathematical steps are accurate, and the thermodynamic principles are correctly applied. The answer is consistent with the original text's statement that the correlation can be used to calculate KP at a given temperature.",
