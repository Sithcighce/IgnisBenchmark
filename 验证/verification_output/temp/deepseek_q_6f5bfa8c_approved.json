  "question_text": "What distinguishes intrinsic thermoacoustic (ITA) modes from classical acoustic cavity modes in terms of their eigenfrequency behavior as the flame interaction index n approaches zero?",
  "standard_answer": "ITA modes and classical acoustic cavity modes exhibit fundamentally different eigenfrequency behaviors in the limit of zero flame interaction index (n → 0). For ITA modes, the growth rate σ tends to -∞, and the frequency ω approaches values determined by the ITA feedback loop's intrinsic dynamics, specifically ω = (2k+1)π/τ for anechoic conditions or ω = kπ/τ for certain reflective setups, as per the phase condition φ = -kπ. In contrast, acoustic cavity modes have growth rates σ that approach zero, and their frequencies remain close to the natural acoustic eigenfrequencies of the system. This divergence arises because ITA modes are governed by the poles of the flame's scattering matrix (satisfying ξ + α + αθF(s) = 0), which become dominant when n is small but finite, whereas acoustic modes are perturbations of the passive acoustic eigenvalues. The distinction is evident in parametric maps where ITA trajectories show large negative growth rates at low n, while acoustic trajectories originate from the imaginary axis.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "We observe that in the limit of n → 0, the eigenfrequencies associated with the ITA trajectories go to (2k + 1)π/τ because the equation ξ + α + αθF(ω) must be satisfied in this limit, as discussed at the beginning of this section.",
    "2": "Acoustic trajectories composed by eigenfrequencies, where the growth rate σ goes to zero as n goes to zero. These eigenfrequencies are labeled ‘Born Acoustic’ in Mukherjee and Shrira [42] and of ‘acoustic origin’ in Orchini et al. [30]."

It correctly states that: (1) ITA modes have growth rates σ→-∞ and frequencies approaching (2k+1)π/τ (matching the original text's statement about satisfying ξ+α+αθF(ω)=0), (2) acoustic modes have σ→0 as n→0 (consistent with original text), (3) the physical mechanisms are correctly attributed (ITA modes governed by flame scattering matrix poles vs acoustic modes as perturbations of passive eigenvalues). The answer provides additional context about the phase condition and parametric maps that is consistent with thermoacoustic theory and does not contradict the original text.

It accurately states that for ITA modes, the growth rate (σ) tends to negative infinity while the frequency (ω) converges to values determined by the flame's intrinsic time delay (τ), which is consistent with and elaborates upon sentence [1] of the original text. It also correctly states that for acoustic modes, the growth rate approaches zero, which directly matches sentence [2].
