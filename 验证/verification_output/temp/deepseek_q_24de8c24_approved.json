  "question_text": "How does the temperature dependence of linestrength in laser absorption spectroscopy enable accurate temperature measurements in combustion systems, and what physical principles govern this relationship?",
  "standard_answer": "The temperature dependence of linestrength enables temperature measurements through the two-line thermometric technique, which exploits the Boltzmann population distribution of molecular energy states. According to Eq. (3), linestrength S(T) depends on temperature via the partition function Q(T) and the lower energy state E''. For two transitions with different lower-state energies, the ratio of their integrated absorbances R = A1/A2 = S1(T)/S2(T) becomes a unique function of temperature. The sensitivity of this measurement, given by dR/R / dT/T ≈ - (hc/k)(E''2 - E''1)/T, increases with the difference in lower-state energies (E''2 - E''1). This occurs because molecules redistribute among rotational-vibrational states according to Boltzmann statistics: at higher temperatures, higher-energy states become more populated, enhancing transitions from these states. The partition function Q(T) accounts for the number of accessible states, growing with temperature and further modulating linestrength. In combustion applications, selecting lines with large ΔE'' ensures measurable absorbance changes with temperature, while the method's path-averaged nature requires careful line selection to minimize errors from non-uniform temperature fields.",

    "1": "S(T) = S(T0) [ Q(T0)/Q(T) ] [ exp( -hcE''/k (1/T - 1/T0) ) ] [ (1 - exp(-hcν/kT)) / (1 - exp(-hcν/kT0)) ]^-1",
    "2": "The sensitivity of the measurement is determined by differentiating Eq. (11) with respect to T and obtaining the following approximate expression [70]: dR/R / dT/T = - (hc/k) (E''2 - E''1)/T"
