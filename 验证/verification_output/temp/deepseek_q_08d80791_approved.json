  "question_text": "How do fullerene-based nanocatalysts like fullerene hydrazine nitrate (FHN) influence the decomposition kinetics and thermal behavior of nitramines such as RDX and HMX, based on their multi-step decomposition characteristics and catalytic effects documented in the literature?",
  "standard_answer": "Fullerene-based nanocatalysts like FHN affect nitramine decomposition through their distinct multi-step decomposition profile and catalytic properties. FHN undergoes at least four decomposition steps under an N₂ atmosphere, starting around 150°C, which precedes the main decomposition of nitramines like RDX and HMX. This early decomposition releases energy and reactive species that interact with the nitramine molecules. The catalytic effect is evidenced by reductions in decomposition peak temperatures and activation energies. Specifically, FHN accelerates the decomposition of RDX and HMX, reducing the peak temperatures of exothermal decomposition. The corresponding activation energy (Ea) of RDX is decreased by 17 kJ·mol⁻¹, and that of HMX is reduced by more than 20 kJ·mol⁻¹. This multi-stage decomposition provides thermal energy and reactive intermediates that lower the energy barrier for nitramine decomposition, enhancing the overall decomposition kinetics without speculative mechanistic details beyond the cited evidence.",

The answer appropriately elaborates on the catalytic mechanism (energy and reactive species release, lowering energy barriers) while staying within the bounds of the cited evidence. The physical and chemical principles are sound, and the cause-effect relationships are logically consistent.
