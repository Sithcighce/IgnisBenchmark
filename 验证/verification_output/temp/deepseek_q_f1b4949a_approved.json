  "question_text": "Analyze the chemical kinetic mechanisms through which free fatty acid (FFA) content in biodiesel feedstocks affects transesterification yield during base-catalyzed production, and explain how these mechanisms lead to reduced biodiesel yield according to the provided paper content.",
  "standard_answer": "High FFA content in biodiesel feedstocks initiates competing chemical pathways that significantly reduce biodiesel yield through saponification reactions. When alkaline catalysts (KOH, NaOH) are used in base-catalyzed transesterification, FFAs react with the catalyst to form soap and water instead of undergoing the desired transesterification reaction: R-COOH + KOH → R-COOK + H₂O. This side reaction consumes the alkaline catalyst, reducing the active catalyst concentration available for the main transesterification reaction. The soap formation creates emulsions that complicate glycerol separation from the biodiesel product. For feedstocks with FFA content exceeding 2% (4 mg KOH/g), biodiesel yield drops dramatically due to these competing pathways. The paper specifically notes that there is significant drop in ester conversion when FFA content increases beyond this threshold, and saponification is identified as an undesirable reaction because formation of soap lowers biodiesel yield significantly and inhibits separation of esters from glycerol.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately explains the chemical kinetic mechanisms by which high FFA content reduces biodiesel yield through saponification reactions. It correctly describes: (1) the saponification reaction equation (R-COOH + KOH → R-COOK + H₂O), (2) catalyst consumption reducing active catalyst for transesterification, (3) soap formation creating emulsions that complicate separation, (4) the 2% (4 mg KOH/g) FFA threshold for significant yield drop, and (5) the inhibition of ester-glycerol separation. All statements are consistent with the original text excerpts and represent sound chemical principles. The answer appropriately elaborates on the mechanisms while remaining factually accurate.",

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly identifies saponification of FFAs with alkaline catalysts as the competing pathway that lowers biodiesel yield, notes catalyst consumption and emulsion formation that hinder phase separation, and correctly cites the >2% (4 mg KOH/g) FFA threshold where ester conversion drops significantly.
