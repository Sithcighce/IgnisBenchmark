  "question_text": "Calculate the theoretical SO2 emission rate in g/kWh for a marine engine burning fuel with 2.5% sulfur content, assuming complete conversion of fuel sulfur to SO2, and explain how this changes with scrubber efficiency.",
  "standard_answer": "To calculate SO2 emissions, start with the fuel's sulfur content and energy basis. For marine fuels, typical lower heating value (LHV) is ~42 MJ/kg. Sulfur mass fraction: 2.5% = 0.025 kg S/kg fuel. Upon combustion, S + O2 → SO2, so molecular weights: S (32 g/mol) to SO2 (64 g/mol), giving a conversion factor of 64/32 = 2. Thus, SO2 produced per kg fuel = 0.025 kg S/kg fuel × 2 = 0.05 kg SO2/kg fuel. Energy input per kg fuel = 42 MJ. SO2 emission per MJ = 0.05 kg / 42 MJ = 0.00119 kg/MJ = 1.19 g/MJ. Convert to g/kWh: 1 kWh = 3.6 MJ, so SO2 = 1.19 g/MJ × 3.6 MJ/kWh = 4.28 g/kWh. This is the engine-out emission without control. With a scrubber of efficiency η (e.g., 99%), post-scrubber SO2 = 4.28 × (1 - η) g/kWh. For η=0.99, SO2 = 0.0428 g/kWh, demonstrating scrubbers' effectiveness even with high-sulfur fuels.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer's calculation yields 4.28 g/kWh for 2.5% sulfur fuel, but this is inconsistent with the original text's data points. The original text states that 3.5% sulfur produces 14 g/kWh and 0.5% sulfur produces 2 g/kWh. These values show a linear relationship: (14-2)/(3.5-0.5) = 4 g/kWh per percentage point of sulfur. Therefore, 2.5% sulfur should yield approximately 2 + (2.5-0.5)×4 = 10 g/kWh, not 4.28 g/kWh. The discrepancy suggests an error in the calculation methodology, possibly in the LHV value used or the conversion factors. The scrubber efficiency discussion methodology is sound, but the base calculation is incorrect.",
