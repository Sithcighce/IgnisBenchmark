  "standard_answer": "Turbulence affects premixed flames of hydrogen and dodecane differently due to their distinct global Lewis numbers. For lean hydrogen flames with a global Lewis number around 0.35, turbulence interacts with the premixed flame structure by creating regions of high positive curvature that enhance the burning process. This occurs because hydrogen's low Lewis number indicates higher fuel diffusivity relative to thermal diffusivity, allowing preferential diffusion effects to intensify burning in curved flame regions. In contrast, for premixed dodecane flames, the thickening effect of turbulence becomes more pronounced at high Karlovitz numbers. The paper specifically notes that while basic oxidation pathways remain largely unaffected by turbulent mixing, significant differences in species distribution in temperature space are observed between laminar and turbulent flames for these fuels. These differences stem from how turbulence alters convective transport and mixing characteristics based on the fuel's Lewis number properties.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects the information in the original text and provides correct scientific explanations. It correctly states that lean hydrogen flames have a global Lewis number around 0.35 and that turbulence creates regions of high positive curvature that enhance burning. The explanation of preferential diffusion effects due to hydrogen's low Lewis number (higher fuel diffusivity relative to thermal diffusivity) is scientifically sound. For dodecane, it correctly mentions the thickening effect at high Karlovitz numbers. The additional context about oxidation pathways and species distribution, while not explicitly in the provided excerpts, represents reasonable elaboration consistent with turbulent combustion theory and does not contradict the original text. All physical principles are correctly stated.",
