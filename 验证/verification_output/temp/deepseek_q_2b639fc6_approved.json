  "question_text": "How does the cavity aspect ratio and geometry in a trapped vortex combustor (TVC) influence the formation of a stable locked vortex, and what are the aerodynamic mechanisms that prevent vortex shedding under high inlet velocities?",
  "standard_answer": "The cavity aspect ratio (length-to-depth ratio) critically determines vortex stability in TVCs. For optimal flame holding, the cavity must be sized to create a steady cavity vortex regime where the vortex is fully contained within the cavity without spilling over the aft-body. When the cavity is properly designed, the main flow smoothly passes over the cavity, creating a large rotating vortex that remains 'locked' due to minimal fluid exchange with the mainstream. This stability arises because the stagnation point shifts to the aft-body's top surface, disconnecting the cavity vortex from the wake. In contrast, undersized cavities lead to unsteady vortices influenced by downstream wake flow, while oversized cavities result in compressed vortex regimes with direct flow impingement on the aft-body, causing high drag and instability. The locked vortex resists shedding even at high velocities because the recirculation zone is shielded from the main flow, reducing shear layer instabilities that typically cause blowout in conventional combustors.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "When the cavity size of a TVC is well designed, a large rotating vortex can be formed in the cavity. The vortex cannot shed out the cavity and is thus named a 'locked' or 'stable' vortex.",
    "2": "For the 1st and 2nd flow regimes, the vortices generated between the fore- and after-body are not fully included in the cavity. They are still somehow related to the downstream recirculation zone."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly explains the trapped vortex combustor mechanism and is consistent with the original text. It accurately describes how a properly sized cavity creates a stable locked vortex that remains contained within the cavity. The answer correctly states that undersized cavities lead to vortices that are 'influenced by downstream wake flow,' which aligns with the original text's statement that vortices in the 1st and 2nd flow regimes are 'not fully included in the cavity' and 'still somehow related to the downstream recirculation zone.' The physical mechanisms described (stagnation point shift, minimal fluid exchange, shielding from main flow) are sound aerodynamic principles. The answer provides additional detail beyond the original text, but all statements are factually accurate and logically consistent with established combustion and fluid dynamics principles.",

        "reasoning": "The answer aligns with the ground-truth points: a well-sized cavity yields a large vortex that remains trapped (locked) and does not shed, while smaller/early-regime configurations interact with downstream recirculation. It correctly attributes stability to the vortex being fully contained and shielded from the main flow, reducing coupling with wake/shear-layer instabilities. Additional details on aspect ratio effects and flow shielding are consistent with accepted TVC physics and do not contradict the provided text.",
