  "question_text": "Calculate the kinematic viscosity of a biodiesel blend containing 40% methyl palmitate (C16:0, viscosity = 4.38 mm²/s), 35% methyl oleate (C18:1, viscosity = 4.51 mm²/s), and 25% methyl linoleate (C18:2, viscosity = 3.65 mm²/s) using the additive mixing rule, and explain why viscosity follows this linear relationship while other properties like cold flow do not.",
  "standard_answer": "Using the additive mixing equation Pr_mix = Σ(A_C × Pr_C), where A_C is the mass or volume fraction and Pr_C is the property of the pure component: Viscosity_blend = (0.40 × 4.38) + (0.35 × 4.51) + (0.25 × 3.65) = 1.752 + 1.5785 + 0.9125 = 4.243 mm²/s. This calculated viscosity falls within the typical biodiesel range of 3.5-5.0 mm²/s specified in standards. Viscosity follows linear mixing rules because it is primarily determined by molecular size and intermolecular forces that scale proportionally with composition. The London dispersion forces between hydrocarbon chains and the polar interactions at ester groups contribute additively to the overall resistance to flow. In contrast, cold flow properties exhibit non-linear behavior because crystallization represents a phase transition phenomenon where minor components can significantly disrupt or promote crystal nucleation and growth. The formation of solid phases depends on molecular packing efficiency, which is highly sensitive to molecular geometry and cannot be described by simple linear combinations. This fundamental difference explains why viscosity can be accurately predicted while cold flow properties require more complex modeling approaches.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "The properties of mixtures that generally do not pose operational problems can be predicted by the general equation Pr_mix = Σ(A_C × Pr_C) in which Pr_mix is the property of the mixture being predicted, A_C = the relative amount of an individual neat ester in the mixture, and Pr_C is the property of the individual neat ester.",
    "2": "These properties are kinematic viscosity, cetane number and density as discussed below in the corresponding sections."

The calculation is accurate: (0.40 × 4.38) + (0.35 × 4.51) + (0.25 × 3.65) = 4.243 mm²/s. The original text confirms that kinematic viscosity is one of the properties that can be predicted using this linear mixing rule and 'generally do not pose operational problems.' The explanation of why viscosity follows linear mixing (molecular size and intermolecular forces scaling proportionally) is physically sound. The contrast with cold flow properties (phase transition phenomena with non-linear behavior due to crystallization) is a reasonable extension that doesn't contradict the original text, which only states what CAN be predicted linearly, not what cannot. All physical principles stated are correct, and the reasoning is logically consistent.",
