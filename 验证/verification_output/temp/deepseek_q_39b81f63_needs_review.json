  "question_text": "Calculate the characteristic transverse diffusion time scale and gas-phase Damköhler number for a catalytic channel with half-height b = 3.5 mm, thermal diffusivity α_th,IN = 2.5 × 10⁻⁵ m²/s, pressure p = 10 bar, and a global reaction rate expression with B_g = 10¹⁰, n_F = 1, n_O = 0.5, γ = 0, T_w = 1200 K, Y_F,IN = 0.05, Y_O,IN = 0.20, and E_g = 150 kJ/mol. For hydrogen oxidation (H₂ + 0.5O₂ → H₂O), use W_F = 0.002 kg/mol for H₂, W_O = 0.032 kg/mol for O₂, R = 8.314 J/mol·K. Determine the correct limiting reactant concentration considering the stoichiometric oxygen-to-fuel mass ratio of 8:1 for H₂ combustion, and explain the proper treatment when the stoichiometric-adjusted concentration difference becomes negative according to combustion kinetics principles.",
  "standard_answer": "The characteristic transverse diffusion time scale is calculated as τ_d = b²/α_th,IN = (0.0035 m)²/(2.5 × 10⁻⁵ m²/s) = 0.49 s. For the gas-phase chemical time τ_ch,g, we first determine the limiting reactant. The stoichiometric oxygen requirement for H₂ combustion is 8 kg O₂ per kg H₂. The available oxygen mass fraction relative to fuel is Y_O,IN/Y_F,IN = 0.20/0.05 = 4, which is less than the stoichiometric requirement of 8, indicating oxygen is the limiting reactant. The stoichiometric-adjusted oxygen concentration term is Y_O,IN - (W_Oν_O/W_F)Y_F,IN, where ν_O = 0.5 (molar basis) and the mass-based stoichiometric coefficient is W_Oν_O/W_F = (0.032×0.5)/0.002 = 8. This gives 0.20 - 8×0.05 = 0.20 - 0.40 = -0.20. In combustion kinetics, when this stoichiometric-adjusted concentration difference becomes negative, it indicates fuel-rich conditions where the deficient reactant (oxygen) is fully consumed. The correct approach is to use the absolute value of this negative difference in the chemical time calculation, as it represents the effective limiting concentration that drives the reaction rate. Now calculating τ_ch,g = [B_g (pW_F/R)^(1-n_F) W_O^(-n_O) T_w^(1+γ-n_F+n_O) (Y_F,IN)^(n_F) (|Y_O,IN - W_Oν_O Y_F,IN/W_F|)^(n_O) exp(-E_g/RT_w)]^(-1): pW_F/R = (10×10⁵ Pa)(0.002 kg/mol)/(8.314 J/mol·K) = 240.6 kg·K/J, (pW_F/R)^(1-n_F) = (240.6)^0 = 1, W_O^(-n_O) = (0.032)^(-0.5) = 5.59 mol^(0.5)/kg^(0.5), T_w^(1+γ-n_F+n_O) = (1200)^(1+0-1+0.5) = (1200)^(0.5) = 34.64 K^(0.5), (Y_F,IN)^(n_F) = (0.05)^1 = 0.05, (|Y_O,IN - W_Oν_O Y_F,IN/W_F|)^(n_O) = (|-0.20|)^(0.5) = (0.20)^(0.5) = 0.447, exp(-E_g/RT_w) = exp(-150000/(8.314×1200)) = exp(-15.03) = 3.06×10⁻⁷. Thus τ_ch,g = [10¹⁰ × 1 × 5.59 × 34.64 × 0.05 × 0.447 × 3.06×10⁻⁷]^(-1) = [10¹⁰ × 1.33×10⁻⁷]^(-1) = [1330]^(-1) = 7.52×10⁻⁴ s. The gas-phase Damköhler number is Da_g = τ_d/τ_ch,g = 0.49 s / 7.52×10⁻⁴ s = 651. This high Damköhler number indicates fast gas-phase chemistry relative to diffusion, suggesting potential for homogeneous ignition. The correction using the absolute value ensures proper handling of the limiting reactant in fuel-rich conditions where oxygen is deficient and fully consumed.",
