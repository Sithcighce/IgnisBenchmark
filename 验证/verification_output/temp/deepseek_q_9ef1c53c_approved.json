  "question_text": "How does the Stefan condition mathematically describe the moving boundary problem in solid-liquid PCM phase transitions, and what physical mechanisms does it account for based on the provided paper content?",
  "standard_answer": "The Stefan condition provides the mathematical framework for tracking the moving solid-liquid interface during PCM phase transitions by balancing the latent heat absorption/release with the conductive heat fluxes from both phases. The equation H_s-lρ(ds(t)/dt) = k_s(δT_s/δx) - k_l(δT_l/δx) describes how the interface velocity ds/dt depends on the latent heat of fusion H_s-l, density ρ, and the thermal conductivity gradients across the interface. This formulation accounts for the energy required for phase transition, where the latent heat term represents the energy barrier for phase change. The condition captures conductive heat transfer mechanisms in both solid and liquid phases, with k_s and k_l governing heat diffusion rates. The time-dependent nature of phase front propagation makes this a nonlinear moving boundary problem, requiring numerical simulation using computational packages within specific temperature ranges due to the unknown position and velocity of the boundary in advance.",

    "1": "The Stephan condition describes this procedure, which is expressed as follows: H_s-lρ(ds(t)/dt) = k_s(δT_s/δx) - k_l(δT_l/δx)",
    "2": "The position and velocity of this boundary are unknown in advance. Numerical simulation of the PCM during phase transition is often carried out using computational packages (e.g., COMSOL Multiphysics, ANSYS-FLUENT, Star-CCM+) within a specific temperature range."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately describes the Stefan condition and its physical mechanisms. It correctly presents the equation H_s-lρ(ds(t)/dt) = k_s(δT_s/δx) - k_l(δT_l/δx) and properly explains each term: latent heat of fusion (H_s-l), density (ρ), interface velocity (ds/dt), and thermal conductivity gradients (k_s and k_l). The answer correctly identifies the physical mechanisms: energy balance at the interface, latent heat absorption/release during phase transition, and conductive heat transfer in both phases. It accurately characterizes this as a nonlinear moving boundary problem with unknown boundary position and velocity, and correctly mentions the use of computational packages for numerical simulation. All statements are consistent with the original text and reflect sound thermophysical principles. The answer is more detailed than the original text but contains no factual errors or logical contradictions.",
