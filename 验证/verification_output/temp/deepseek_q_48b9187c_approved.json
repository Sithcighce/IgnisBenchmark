  "question_text": "Why is isocyanic acid (HNCO) observed to be highly stable in the gas phase during SCR operation, and how do mass transfer limitations affect its catalytic hydrolysis on SCR catalysts?",
  "standard_answer": "Isocyanic acid (HNCO) demonstrates high stability in the gas phase during SCR operation because it does not readily undergo homogeneous hydrolysis without catalytic surfaces. Experimental observations show similar concentrations of ammonia and isocyanic acid are detected in the gas phase, indicating HNCO persists rather than decomposing. This stability poses challenges for SCR systems because HNCO must be converted to ammonia on the catalyst surface for effective NOx reduction. The catalytic hydrolysis of HNCO is consistently limited by internal and external mass transfer, meaning the reaction rate is constrained by how quickly HNCO molecules can diffuse to and within the catalyst pores rather than by the surface reaction kinetics itself. This mass transfer limitation is observed across different catalysts and leads to decreased hydrolysis activity. Additionally, competitive adsorption between HNCO and NH3 on catalyst sites can further reduce hydrolysis efficiency and potentially lead to ammonium nitrate formation, which can poison the catalyst. These factors necessitate SCR catalyst designs and operating conditions that enhance mass transfer, such as optimized monolith geometries with high surface areas, to ensure complete HNCO conversion before it exits the system.",

Additional context provided (e.g., slow homogeneous hydrolysis and implications for SCR design) is reasonable and does not contradict the ground truth.",
