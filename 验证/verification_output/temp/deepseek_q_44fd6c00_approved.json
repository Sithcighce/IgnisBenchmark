  "question_text": "Calculate the total thermal energy storage capacity for a latent TES system containing 50 kg of paraffin wax PCM with melting temperature 28°C, latent heat of fusion 160 kJ/kg, specific heat capacities of 2.5 kJ/kg·K (solid) and 3.0 kJ/kg·K (liquid), operating between 15°C and 45°C. Compare this to a sensible TES system using water (c_p = 4.18 kJ/kg·K) storing the same amount of energy over the same temperature range.",
  "standard_answer": "For the latent TES system: Q_latent = M[∫_T_i^T_m c_p,s dT + H_s-l + ∫_T_m^T_f c_p,l dT] = 50[∫_15^28 2.5 dT + 160 + ∫_28^45 3.0 dT] = 50[2.5×(28-15) + 160 + 3.0×(45-28)] = 50[32.5 + 160 + 51] = 50 × 243.5 = 12,175 kJ. For the sensible water system storing equivalent energy: Q_sensible = M_water c_p,water ΔT = M_water × 4.18 × (45-15) = M_water × 125.4 kJ. Setting equal to 12,175 kJ gives M_water = 12,175/125.4 ≈ 97.1 kg. The latent system stores the same energy with approximately 48.5% less mass than the sensible system, demonstrating the superior energy density of PCM-based storage. This calculation highlights the dual functionality of latent TES, combining sensible heating in both solid and liquid phases with the high-energy-density phase transition process.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly applies the latent TES energy storage equation from the original text. All calculations are accurate: sensible heating of solid phase (2.5×13=32.5 kJ/kg), latent heat (160 kJ/kg), sensible heating of liquid phase (3.0×17=51 kJ/kg), totaling 243.5 kJ/kg for 50 kg = 12,175 kJ. The comparison with water is correctly calculated (M_water = 12,175/125.4 ≈ 97.1 kg), demonstrating 48.5% mass reduction. The conclusion aligns with the original text's statement that latent TES has higher energy storage density than sensible TES. The physical principles are sound, the mathematical derivation is correct, and the interpretation properly highlights the dual functionality of PCM systems combining sensible and latent heat storage.",

Water sensible capacity per kg over 30 K is 4.18*30 = 125.4 kJ/kg; required mass = 12,175/125.4 ≈ 97.1 kg.
