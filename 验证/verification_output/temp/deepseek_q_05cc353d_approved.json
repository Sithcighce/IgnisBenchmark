  "question_text": "Calculate the specific surface area required for a biomass-derived carbon supercapacitor electrode to achieve a capacitance of 300 F/g, assuming a typical double-layer capacitance of 10 μF/cm² and negligible pseudocapacitance. How does heteroatom doping alter this requirement?",
  "standard_answer": "The specific capacitance (C_sp) of an electric double-layer capacitor is given by C_sp = C_dl × SSA, where C_dl is the double-layer capacitance per unit area (~10 μF/cm² for aqueous electrolytes) and SSA is the specific surface area in cm²/g. Rearranging for SSA: SSA = C_sp / C_dl = (300 F/g) / (10 × 10⁻⁶ F/cm²) = 3 × 10⁷ cm²/g = 3000 m²/g. Thus, a pristine carbon material would need approximately 3000 m²/g SSA to achieve 300 F/g solely via double-layer mechanisms. However, heteroatom doping introduces pseudocapacitance through redox reactions, significantly reducing the SSA requirement. For example, if doping contributes 150 F/g from pseudocapacitance, the double-layer contribution needed drops to 150 F/g, requiring only 1500 m²/g SSA. This reduction is critical for biomass-derived carbons, which often achieve SSAs of 1000–2000 m²/g after activation. Doping also enhances wettability and conductivity, improving utilization of available surface area and enabling higher practical capacitances at moderate SSAs.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly applies the fundamental relationship C_sp = C_dl × SSA and accurately calculates that 3000 m²/g is required for 300 F/g with pure double-layer capacitance. The calculation is mathematically correct: (300 F/g) / (10 × 10⁻⁶ F/cm²) = 3 × 10⁷ cm²/g = 3000 m²/g. The discussion of heteroatom doping reducing SSA requirements through pseudocapacitance is scientifically sound and consistent with the original text, which shows a device achieving 525 F/g (higher than the 300 F/g target) and biomass-derived carbon with 2690 m²/g SSA (close to the calculated 3000 m²/g). The answer correctly explains that doping can contribute additional capacitance, reducing the SSA needed from double-layer mechanisms alone. The example calculation (150 F/g pseudocapacitance reducing SSA requirement to 1500 m²/g) is logically consistent. The statement about typical biomass-derived carbon SSAs (1000-2000 m²/g) aligns with the original text's example of 2690 m²/g. All physical principles regarding double-layer capacitance, pseudocapacitance, and the effects of heteroatom doping are correctly stated.",

        ],
        "reasoning": "The calculation SSA = C_sp / C_dl is correct: 300 F/g divided by 10 μF/cm² (10×10⁻⁶ F/cm²) yields 3×10⁷ cm²/g = 3000 m²/g. The treatment of heteroatom doping adding pseudocapacitance and thereby reducing the SSA required for the double-layer contribution is logically and physically sound.

The calculation `SSA = C_sp / C_dl` is performed correctly, including the unit conversion, yielding a valid theoretical SSA of 3000 m²/g.
