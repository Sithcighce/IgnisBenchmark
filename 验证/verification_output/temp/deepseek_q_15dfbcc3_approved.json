  "question_text": "How does the temperature coefficient of power (βPmax) in photovoltaic cells affect the electrical efficiency of PV-T collectors, and what are the dominant physical mechanisms behind this temperature dependency?",
  "standard_answer": "The temperature coefficient of power (βPmax) quantifies how the electrical power output of a PV cell decreases with increasing temperature, which is critical in PV-T collectors where thermal management is essential. βPmax is composed of three coefficients: βVoc (voltage coefficient), βJsc (current coefficient), and βFF (fill factor coefficient). The voltage coefficient dominates the power loss due to increased internal recombination rates at higher temperatures, as described by dVoc/dT = -(Eg/q - Voc + γkT/q)/T, where Eg is the band-gap energy, q is electronic charge, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, and γ is an empirical parameter accounting for recombination mechanisms. Higher temperatures increase non-radiative recombination, reducing the quasi-Fermi level separation and thus the open-circuit voltage (Voc). The current coefficient (βJsc) is weakly positive because thermal expansion reduces the band-gap slightly, allowing absorption of more photons, but this effect is minor. The fill factor (FF) also decreases with temperature due to increased series resistance and reduced voltage, as per 1/FF * dFF/dT = (1 - 1.02FF0)[(1/Voc)(dVoc/dT) - 1/T - (Rs/(Voc/Isc - Rs))(1/Rs)(dRs/dT)]. In PV-T collectors, efficient heat extraction mitigates temperature rise, preserving electrical efficiency by minimizing these losses.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "The temperature coefficient of power (βPmax) is composed of the sum of three different coefficients: βPmax = βVoc + βJsc + βFF",
    "2": "Of these temperature coefficients, the voltage coefficient (βVoc) dominates the power loss with increasing temperature, owing to an increase in internal recombination rate with temperature."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly explains that βPmax is composed of three coefficients (βVoc, βJsc, βFF) and that the voltage coefficient dominates power loss due to increased internal recombination at higher temperatures, which is fully consistent with the original text. The answer provides extensive additional detail including mathematical expressions for dVoc/dT and fill factor temperature dependence, explanations of physical mechanisms (non-radiative recombination, quasi-Fermi level separation, band-gap reduction), and discussion of PV-T collector thermal management. All these additional details are physically sound and represent correct elaboration beyond the original text. The core facts match the original text perfectly: (1) βPmax = βVoc + βJsc + βFF, and (2) βVoc dominates due to increased recombination with temperature. No factual errors, logical contradictions, or inconsistencies with established photovoltaic physics are present.",

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly states that βPmax is the sum of βVoc, βJsc, and βFF, and that βVoc dominates the temperature-induced power loss due to increased recombination—both consistent with the provided ground-truth text. It accurately explains that higher temperature reduces Voc via increased recombination (reduced quasi-Fermi level separation), notes the small positive temperature coefficient of Jsc, and recognizes FF degradation with temperature. It also connects PV-T thermal management to mitigating temperature rise and preserving electrical efficiency. No substantive factual or logical errors are present.",
