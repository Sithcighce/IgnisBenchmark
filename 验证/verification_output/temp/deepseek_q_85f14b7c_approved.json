  "question_text": "Based on the provided paper content, explain how chlorine-containing species deposit on boiler superheater tubes in MSW incineration systems, focusing on the role of temperature in deposition and the resulting corrosion mechanisms above 450°C.",
  "standard_answer": "Chlorine-containing species deposit on boiler superheater tubes primarily through condensation mechanisms when the metal temperature falls below the saturation temperatures of volatile alkali and heavy metal chlorides. As the paper states: 'These chlorides may form deposits on boiler tubes when the metal temperature becomes lower than the saturation temperatures of alkali and heavy metal chlorides.' The temperature gradient between hot flue gas and cooler tube surfaces drives this deposition process. Once deposited, these chloride-rich layers initiate severe corrosion at elevated temperatures. The paper specifically notes: 'At temperatures > 450 °C, boiler tubes consequently suffer from Cl-initiated corrosion.' This corrosion occurs through multiple mechanisms including gaseous chlorine attack, alkali compound deposit corrosion, and corrosion by molten alkali chloride eutectic compounds that form at these high temperatures. The corrosion severity increases with temperature due to enhanced chemical reactivity and the formation of low-melting-point eutectic mixtures that facilitate corrosive species transport to the tube metal surface, ultimately leading to material degradation and boiler tube failure.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately explains the chlorine deposition and corrosion mechanism based on the original text. It correctly states that: (1) chlorides deposit when metal temperature falls below saturation temperatures of volatile alkali and heavy metal chlorides, (2) temperature gradient drives deposition, and (3) Cl-initiated corrosion occurs at temperatures >450°C. The answer provides additional mechanistic details (gaseous chlorine attack, alkali compound deposit corrosion, eutectic formation) that are consistent with established combustion science and corrosion principles. While more detailed than the original text, all statements are scientifically sound and no factual errors or logical contradictions are present. The cause-effect relationships are correctly described.",
