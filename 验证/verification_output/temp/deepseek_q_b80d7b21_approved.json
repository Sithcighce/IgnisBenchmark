  "question_text": "What hydrodynamic challenges arise in fluidized bed reactors during plastic pyrolysis, and how do conical spouted bed reactors address these issues? Support your answer with specific mechanisms and operational advantages.",
  "standard_answer": "Fluidized bed reactors face significant defluidization problems during plastic pyrolysis due to agglomeration of molten plastics with bed materials. This occurs because plastics have low softening temperatures and become sticky when melted, causing particles to sinter and form agglomerates that increase bed resistance and pressure drop. The inorganic compositions in feedstock, increased bed particle size, higher temperatures, and lower gas velocities accelerate defluidization by enhancing sintering rates. Once defluidized, temperature gradients develop, reducing gas-solid contact and promoting undesirable secondary reactions that lower product quality. Conical spouted bed reactors (CSBRs) overcome these limitations through their unique geometry and flow regime. The conical design creates three distinct regions: spout, annulus, and fountain, which enable extremely vigorous particle mixing. This provides high heat and mass transfer coefficients between gas and solid phases, preventing localized hot spots and agglomeration. Additionally, CSBRs achieve very short residence times for pyrolysis vapors, minimizing secondary reactions and coke formation. The intense mixing also facilitates effective catalyst utilization in in-situ catalytic pyrolysis by ensuring uniform contact between catalyst particles and molten polymer vapors.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "In spite of the many advantages of fluidized bed reactors, defluidization problems caused by the agglomeration of the molten plastics and heat carriers need to be taken seriously",
    "2": "Another advantage of CSBR design over fluidized bed reactors is to lower the reactant residence time to about 20 ms, thus avoiding undesirable secondary reactions and alleviating coke formation"

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately addresses the hydrodynamic challenges in fluidized bed reactors and the advantages of conical spouted bed reactors. It correctly identifies defluidization due to agglomeration of molten plastics with bed materials as the primary challenge, which is consistent with the original text [1]. The answer provides sound explanations of the mechanisms (low softening temperatures, sticky behavior, sintering, particle agglomeration) and factors that accelerate defluidization. The description of CSBR advantages is accurate, including the three-region geometry (spout, annulus, fountain), vigorous mixing, high heat/mass transfer, prevention of hot spots and agglomeration. Critically, it correctly states that CSBRs achieve very short residence times for pyrolysis vapors (consistent with the ~20 ms mentioned in [2]), minimizing secondary reactions and coke formation. All physical and chemical principles are correctly stated, cause-effect relationships are sound, and there are no contradictions with the original text. The answer is detailed but contains no factual errors or logical flaws.",
