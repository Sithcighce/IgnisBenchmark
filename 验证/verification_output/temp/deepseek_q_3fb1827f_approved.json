  "question_text": "How do porosity and metal-center-linker coordination number affect the mechanical stability of MOFs used in post-combustion CO₂ capture systems, and what implications does this have for their performance under the mechanical stresses encountered in adsorption/desorption cycles?",
  "standard_answer": "The mechanical stability of MOFs is inversely related to their porosity due to the structural framework's reduced density and increased void spaces, which act as stress concentrators under mechanical loading. As porosity increases, the bulk modulus and shear modulus—key indicators of mechanical stability—decrease, making highly porous MOFs more susceptible to deformation or collapse during compression or shear stresses. This is critical in post-combustion CO₂ capture, where MOFs undergo repeated adsorption/desorption cycles involving pressure and temperature swings, potentially leading to framework degradation over time. The metal-center-linker coordination number mitigates this effect by enhancing framework connectivity; higher coordination numbers (e.g., in zirconium-based MOFs) increase the number of bonds per node, improving structural integrity and resistance to mechanical stresses. For instance, MOFs with higher coordination numbers and lower porosity exhibit superior mechanical stability, as evidenced by higher bulk and shear moduli. This balance is essential for ensuring long-term durability in industrial applications, where mechanical stability influences adsorption capacity, regeneration efficiency, and overall system economics.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "Although MOFs are known for their porous nature and it also counts for adsorption abilities, their mechanical stability decreases with an increase in the porous nature (porosity) of MOFs.",
    "2": "MOFs with a high coordination number of metal-center-linker and lower porosity have higher mechanical stabilities showing higher values of bulk and shear moduli as compared to MOFs with lower values of metal-center-linker coordination number and high porosity."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects the information in the original text and applies sound scientific principles. It correctly states that: (1) mechanical stability decreases with increasing porosity due to reduced density and increased void spaces acting as stress concentrators; (2) higher metal-center-linker coordination numbers enhance framework connectivity and mechanical stability; (3) MOFs with higher coordination numbers and lower porosity exhibit superior mechanical stability with higher bulk and shear moduli. The answer appropriately elaborates on the mechanisms (stress concentrators, framework connectivity) and practical implications (adsorption/desorption cycles, industrial durability) without contradicting the original text. The physical principles regarding mechanical properties, structural integrity, and the relationship between porosity and mechanical stability are correctly stated. While the answer is more detailed than the original text, all additional explanations are scientifically sound and consistent with established MOF chemistry and materials science.",
