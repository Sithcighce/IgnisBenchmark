  "question_text": "What are the rate-controlling mechanisms for sidewall recession in UCG, and how do they shift with temperature and oxidant concentration?",
  "standard_answer": "Sidewall recession in UCG is controlled by the interplay of mass transfer, heat transfer, and chemical kinetics, with the dominant mechanism shifting based on temperature and oxidant concentration. At lower temperatures (<1000 K), chemical kinetics often limit the rate, as reaction rates (e.g., for C + O2 → CO2) follow Arrhenius dependence with high activation energies. As temperature increases, mass transfer becomes limiting due to faster kinetics, where diffusion of reactants (O2, H2O) through boundary layers controls recession. This is evidenced by linear relationships between burn rate and oxygen mole fraction in experiments. Heat transfer can also be rate-controlling if energy transport to the reaction zone is slow, particularly in wet coals where latent heat of vaporization consumes significant energy. For instance, in high-moisture coals, drying fronts advance slowly, delaying pyrolysis and gasification. Under UCG conditions, natural convection enhances mass transfer at high temperatures, but ash layer formation can introduce additional resistance. Modeling shows that at typical UCG temperatures (1200–1500 K), mass transfer often dominates, but local variations in coal properties and oxidant distribution cause dynamic shifts between mechanisms.",

    "1": "It was found that the burn rate was a linear function of the oxygen mole fraction, providing evidence to support the conclusion that the reaction was mass transfer controlled.",
    "2": "Rate controlling mechanisms for sidewall recession include mass transfer, heat transfer and chemical kinetics, with the dominant mechanism shifting based on operational conditions."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly identifies the three rate-controlling mechanisms (mass transfer, heat transfer, and chemical kinetics) mentioned in the original text and accurately describes how they shift with temperature and oxidant concentration. The answer correctly states that mass transfer control is evidenced by linear relationships between burn rate and oxygen mole fraction, which directly aligns with the original text. The detailed explanations about temperature regimes, Arrhenius dependence, boundary layer diffusion, and the role of moisture in heat transfer are all consistent with established combustion science principles. While the answer is more detailed than the original text, all additional information (e.g., specific temperature ranges, chemical reactions, ash layer effects) represents valid elaboration that does not contradict the original text or fundamental principles. The core message that dominant mechanisms shift based on operational conditions is preserved and correctly explained.",
