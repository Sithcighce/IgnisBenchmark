  "question_text": "How do injector design features such as outward-opening piezo-driven configurations, sharp nozzle inlets, and counter-bore designs contribute to preventing deposit formation in GDI engines according to the available research evidence?",
  "standard_answer": "According to the research evidence, these specific injector design features are useful in preventing injector deposit formation. The paper states that 'Outward opening piezo-driven injector configuration with a good surface finish, a sharp nozzle inlet, and a counter bore design, is useful in preventing injector deposit formation.' This indicates that the combination of these design elements provides a beneficial approach to deposit mitigation. Additionally, the research shows that temperature management plays a crucial role, as 'Reducing injector nozzle temperature by methods such as designing special injector cooling passages, and improving engine design are also proven to be helpful in reducing injector fouling.' The effectiveness of these design features likely relates to their ability to maintain proper fuel flow characteristics and thermal management, though the specific fluid dynamics and thermal mechanisms are not detailed in the provided citations. The research emphasizes that injector deposits are primarily fuel-derived and created through free radical pathways including low temperature auto-oxidation and high temperature pyrolysis, making design features that address these fundamental formation mechanisms particularly valuable.",
