  "question_text": "Based on the provided paper, what specific attention is given to structure-dependent drag models like EMMS in CFD simulations of gas-solid fluidized beds, and what computational performance data is presented for EMMS applications?",
  "standard_answer": "The paper explicitly states that 'Special attention is devoted to the forces and the moments of the forces acting on particles, the parcel modeling, the homogeneous and structure-dependent drag models, the non-spherical particle models, the heat and mass transfer, and the turbulence.' This indicates that structure-dependent drag models receive focused consideration alongside other critical modeling aspects in gas-solid flow simulations. Regarding computational performance, the paper provides specific timing data: 'The processing time lasted approximately 4.65 hours of wall-clock time for 1 s of simulation time using EMMS as a drag model while excluding the reaction mechanism.' This computational benchmark demonstrates the practical feasibility of implementing EMMS drag models in industrial-scale simulations, showing that while computationally intensive, such models can be applied within reasonable timeframes for complex fluidized bed systems.",
