  "question_text": "Calculate the effective binary diffusion coefficient for H2 in a H2-H2O mixture at 800°C considering both molecular and Knudsen diffusion, given pore diameter of 1 μm, porosity 0.3, tortuosity 2.0, and total pressure 1 atm.",
  "standard_answer": "The effective binary diffusion coefficient accounting for both molecular and Knudsen diffusion is calculated using the Bosanquet formula: 1/Deff = 1/Dmol + 1/DKn. First, the molecular diffusion coefficient for H2-H2O at 800°C (1073 K) can be estimated from Chapman-Enskog theory or standard correlations. Using the Fuller-Schettler-Giddings correlation: D12 ∝ T^1.75/P, with D12 ≈ 0.1 cm²/s at 300K, 1 atm for H2-H2O, we scale to 1073K: Dmol = 0.1 × (1073/300)^1.75 ≈ 0.1 × 12.3 ≈ 1.23 cm²/s = 1.23×10^-4 m²/s. For Knudsen diffusion: DKn = (d_pore/3)√(8RT/πM) where d_pore = 1 μm = 1×10^-6 m, R = 8.314 J/mol·K, T = 1073 K, M_H2 = 0.002 kg/mol. DKn = (1×10^-6/3)√(8×8.314×1073/(π×0.002)) = 3.33×10^-7 × √(35700) ≈ 3.33×10^-7 × 189 ≈ 6.3×10^-5 m²/s. Then combined diffusion: 1/Dcomb = 1/1.23×10^-4 + 1/6.3×10^-5 = 8130 + 15873 = 24003, so Dcomb = 4.17×10^-5 m²/s. Finally, effective coefficient in porous media: Deff = (ε/τ)Dcomb = (0.3/2.0)×4.17×10^-5 = 0.15×4.17×10^-5 = 6.26×10^-6 m²/s. This shows Knudsen diffusion significantly reduces the effective diffusivity in fine-pore electrodes.",

The calculation methodology is sound: (1) molecular diffusion coefficient estimated using Fuller-Schettler-Giddings correlation with appropriate temperature scaling, (2) Knudsen diffusion calculated using the correct formula with proper molecular parameters for H2, (3) combined diffusion computed using the Bosanquet formula, and (4) effective diffusion in porous media correctly accounts for porosity and tortuosity. The numerical calculations appear reasonable (Dmol ≈ 1.23×10^-4 m²/s, DKn ≈ 6.3×10^-5 m²/s, Dcomb ≈ 4.17×10^-5 m²/s, Deff ≈ 6.26×10^-6 m²/s). The conclusion that Knudsen diffusion significantly reduces effective diffusivity in fine-pore structures is physically correct and consistent with the original text's framework.
