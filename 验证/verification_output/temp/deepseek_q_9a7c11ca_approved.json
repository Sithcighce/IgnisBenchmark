  "standard_answer": "3D computational models are essential for accurate thermomechanical stress analysis of SOFC wire-mesh current collectors because they capture the complex geometrical features that 2D models fundamentally miss. The paper specifically identifies that 'The 2D model is not capable to capture the effects due to the undulation, present in the real 3D structure. The wavy design results in local stress zones at the contact regions of the undulated wire mesh.' This undulation creates localized stress concentrations that cannot be represented in a single plane. Additionally, the paper states that 'The results reveal that the tensile stress around the wavy portion on each thread shows a tensile stress value located in the 26e40 MPa range, whereas higher values are predicted at the contact regions between each wire thread.' This demonstrates that 2D models fail to capture the non-uniform stress distribution and localized high-stress zones at contact points between wire threads, which are critical for understanding potential failure mechanisms in SOFC components. The inability to represent these three-dimensional geometrical effects leads to significant underestimation of actual stress levels and non-conservative designs.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately captures all key points from the original text. It correctly explains that 3D models are necessary because 2D models cannot capture undulation effects in wire-mesh structures. The answer accurately quotes and paraphrases the original text regarding local stress zones at contact regions and the specific stress values (26-40 MPa range with higher values at contact points). The logical flow is sound: geometric complexity → localized stress concentrations → need for 3D modeling. The conclusion about underestimation of stress levels and non-conservative designs is a reasonable inference from the presented evidence. No factual errors or contradictions with the original text are present.",

It correctly links this geometric feature to the creation of localized high-stress zones at contact points, which is the critical information missed by 2D analysis.
