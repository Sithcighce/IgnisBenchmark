  "question_text": "In oxygen-deficient combustion environments such as Claus furnaces, how do sulfur-hydrocarbon interactions lead to the formation of COS and CS₂, and what is their significance in terms of total sulfur emissions from industrial processes?",
  "standard_answer": "COS and CS₂ are formed from the reactions of hydrocarbons with sulfur species during combustion under oxygen deficient condition, and they are produced in less quantities when compared to SO₂. These species are significant pollutants because they contribute substantially to total sulfur emissions from industrial processes. COS and CS₂ are known to account for about 25–50% of the total sulfur emissions from Claus plants. The formation occurs through complex sulfur-hydrocarbon interactions where sulfur radicals react with carbon-containing species under fuel-rich conditions where oxygen is limited. In industrial sulfur recovery units, these compounds represent a major emission concern that necessitates additional catalytic treatment units for effective abatement to meet stringent environmental regulations requiring sulfur recovery efficiencies above 99.9%.",

It correctly states that: (1) COS and CS₂ are formed from hydrocarbon-sulfur reactions under oxygen-deficient conditions and are produced in lesser quantities than SO₂, (2) these species account for 25-50% of total sulfur emissions from Claus plants, and (3) they are significant pollutants. The additional explanations about sulfur-hydrocarbon interaction mechanisms (sulfur radicals reacting with carbon species under fuel-rich conditions), industrial significance, and the need for catalytic treatment units to achieve >99.9% sulfur recovery are consistent with established combustion science and industrial practice in sulfur recovery. No factual errors or logical contradictions are present.",
