  "question_text": "How does the transition to supercritical conditions in methanol enhance the transesterification reaction rate for biodiesel production, and what physical property changes drive this acceleration?",
  "standard_answer": "The transition to supercritical methanol (Tc = 239.2°C, Pc = 8.09 MPa) dramatically enhances transesterification rates through fundamental changes in fluid properties. As methanol enters the supercritical regime, its density increases significantly while dielectric constant decreases, reducing polarity and weakening hydrogen bonding networks. This creates a homogeneous phase where non-polar triglycerides become fully miscible with methanol, eliminating mass transfer limitations that plague subcritical reactions. The breakdown of methanol clusters into free monomers increases molecular mobility and collision frequency. Furthermore, the reduced dielectric constant enhances solvation of transition states during nucleophilic attack on carbonyl groups. The combined effects of improved miscibility, increased molecular diffusion, and enhanced reaction environment lead to reaction rates orders of magnitude faster than conventional catalytic methods, with complete conversions achievable in minutes rather than hours.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly explains the supercritical methanol transesterification mechanism and is fully consistent with the original text. Key points verified: (1) Density increase and dielectric constant decrease are correctly stated as driving forces, matching the original text. (2) Single-phase formation due to these property changes is accurately described. (3) The answer provides additional mechanistic details (hydrogen bonding breakdown, molecular mobility, nucleophilic attack enhancement) that are scientifically sound extensions of the core principles. (4) The cause-effect relationships are logically correct: property changes → improved miscibility → elimination of mass transfer limitations → faster reaction rates. (5) The specific critical parameters (Tc=239.2°C, Pc=8.09 MPa) are standard literature values for methanol. While the answer is more detailed than the original text, all statements are factually accurate and represent valid elaborations of the fundamental mechanisms described in the PECS review.",

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly captures the key supercritical property changes—higher effective density and lower dielectric constant—leading to single-phase miscibility and removal of mass-transfer limits, consistent with the ground-truth text. However, it introduces a mechanistic claim that reduced dielectric constant enhances transition-state solvation, which contradicts basic solvent polarity principles. This constitutes a factual error, so the answer cannot be marked fully correct.",
