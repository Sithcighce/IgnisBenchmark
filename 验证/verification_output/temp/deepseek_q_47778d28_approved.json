  "question_text": "Calculate the octane index (OI) for a fuel with RON=110 and MON=95 under engine conditions where K=-0.5, and explain why a negative K value favors high-sensitivity fuels in modern downsized engines.",
  "standard_answer": "The octane index (OI) is calculated using the formula OI = (1-K)*RON + K*MON. Substituting RON=110, MON=95, and K=-0.5: OI = (1 - (-0.5))*110 + (-0.5)*95 = (1.5)*110 + (-47.5) = 165 - 47.5 = 117.5. A negative K value indicates cooler unburnt gas temperatures relative to pressure, characteristic of modern downsized, turbocharged, and direct-injection engines. These conditions shift the auto-ignition chemistry toward lower temperatures where high-sensitivity fuels (S = RON - MON) excel. For this fuel, S=15, and the OI increases as K decreases because OI = RON - K*S. When K is negative, -K*S becomes positive, augmenting OI beyond RON. This occurs because high-sensitivity fuels, often aromatics or oxygenates, resist auto-ignition better under cooler, high-pressure conditions by leveraging stable radical structures (e.g., benzyl radicals) that inhibit low-temperature chain-branching reactions. Thus, engines with negative K benefit from fuels that maintain high RON while exhibiting significant sensitivity, optimizing anti-knock performance.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "The octane index (OI), as formulated in Eq. (2), introduces a new parameter K, an engine condition dependent weighting factor that is a function of end-gas temperature-pressure history prior to auto-ignition.",
    "2": "In other words, in modern engines at least, fuels with a high S outperform their less sensitive counterparts on the OI scale, an equal RON notwithstanding."

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly calculates OI = 117.5 using the formula OI = (1-K)*RON + K*MON with the given values. The mathematical derivation is accurate. The explanation of why negative K values favor high-sensitivity fuels is sound: it correctly identifies that OI = RON - K*S, showing that when K is negative, the term -K*S becomes positive, increasing OI beyond RON. This aligns with the original text stating that 'fuels with a high S outperform their less sensitive counterparts on the OI scale.' The mechanistic explanation involving cooler unburnt gas temperatures, modern engine characteristics (downsized, turbocharged, direct-injection), and the chemistry of high-sensitivity fuels (aromatics, oxygenates with stable radical structures) is consistent with established combustion science principles. The answer correctly links K to temperature-pressure history as stated in the original text. While the answer is detailed, all statements are factually accurate and logically consistent.",

        "reasoning": "Numerical calculation is correct: OI = (1 - K)RON + K·MON = (1 - (-0.5))·110 + (-0.5)·95 = 117.5. The logic that OI = RON - K·S implies negative K favors high-sensitivity fuels (S = RON - MON) is correct and consistent with the PECS statement that modern engines favor high S. The mechanistic explanation about end-gas T–P history and modern downsized/boosted engines is accurate and does not contradict the original text.",

The explanation correctly links negative K values to the operating conditions of modern downsized engines (high pressure, relatively low temperature), explains why high-sensitivity fuels perform well in this low-temperature chemistry regime, and correctly identifies the underlying chemical kinetic reasons (e.g., formation of stable radicals).
