  "question_text": "How do hydrogen-permeable membranes improve methane conversion in methane dehydroaromatization (MDA) reactors, and what are the thermodynamic and kinetic mechanisms involved?",
  "standard_answer": "Hydrogen-permeable membranes enhance methane conversion in MDA reactors by selectively removing hydrogen from the reaction zone, which shifts the thermodynamic equilibrium toward higher methane conversion according to Le Châtelier's principle. The global MDA reaction (6CH4 → C6H6 + 9H2) is highly endothermic and equilibrium-limited, with hydrogen accumulation suppressing further conversion. By continuously extracting H2 through membranes like palladium or proton-conducting ceramics, the partial pressure of hydrogen decreases, driving the reaction forward. Kinetically, this removal reduces hydrogen inhibition on active sites, potentially accelerating methane activation steps. However, this must be balanced against increased carbon deposition risks, as lower H2 concentrations can promote coke formation from unsaturated intermediates. Membrane materials must exhibit high H2 permeability and selectivity, with protonic ceramic membranes offering additional benefits by possibly introducing steam that reacts with carbon precursors.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "In both cases, the extent of methane conversion is thermodynamically limited by hydrogen accumulation within the reactor. In other words, the reaction can equilibrate with only a fraction of the methane being converted. Ideally, a hydrogen-permeable membrane that selectively removes H2 can promote increased conversion and product yield.",
    "2": "Hydrogen removal can also promote selectivity toward unwanted polyaromatic hydrocarbons, thus competing with the desired benzene yield."

          "Answer states that lower H2 concentrations can promote coke formation, but original text indicates hydrogen removal promotes polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), not explicitly coke. While PAHs can lead to coke, this is an inference beyond what the original text directly states.",
          "Answer discusses 'hydrogen inhibition on active sites' and 'methane activation steps' as kinetic mechanisms, which are reasonable but not explicitly mentioned in the original text.",
          "Answer mentions specific membrane types (palladium, proton-conducting ceramics) and steam reactions with carbon precursors, which go beyond the original text's scope."
        ],
        "reasoning": "The answer correctly captures the core thermodynamic mechanism: hydrogen removal shifts equilibrium toward higher methane conversion per Le Châtelier's principle, which aligns with the original text's statement about thermodynamic limitation by hydrogen accumulation. The answer also acknowledges the selectivity issue mentioned in the original text (unwanted products competing with benzene), though it frames this as 'carbon deposition' and 'coke formation' rather than 'polyaromatic hydrocarbons.' While PAHs can lead to coke, this is a reasonable interpretation. The additional details about kinetic mechanisms, specific membrane materials, and steam reactions are elaborations beyond the original text but appear technically sound and do not contradict it. The answer is comprehensive and factually accurate in its core claims, though it extends beyond what the original text explicitly states.",
