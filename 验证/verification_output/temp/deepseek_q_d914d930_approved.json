  "question_text": "How does the spherical combustion model for methane hydrate demonstrate the necessity of water drainage for sustained flame stability, and what is the practical water/methane molar ratio limit observed in experiments?",
  "standard_answer": "The spherical combustion model for methane hydrate reveals that sustained flame stability requires water drainage because evaporating all hydrate water would reduce the flame temperature below levels necessary for stable combustion. As the water content increases, the effective heating value of the fuel mixture decreases, leading to lower flame temperatures. Experimental observations show that hydrate flame temperatures during steady burning do not fall below approximately 1700 K, which corresponds to a practical water/methane molar ratio (b) of around 2. This indicates that substantial water drainage—approximately half the water—must occur, since the ideal hydrate has a water/methane molar ratio of about 5.75. Without drainage, the high water content would excessively dilute the fuel, reducing the flame temperature and potentially quenching the flame through thermal effects. The model and experiments together highlight that drainage is essential to maintain flame stability by preventing excessive water evaporation that would otherwise lower the combustion temperature below sustainable limits.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "It is worthwhile noting that experiments show that hydrate flame temperatures during steady burning do not seem to fall below 1700 K at any time, suggesting that a practical value of b is around 2. Hence, there must be a substantial water drainage (approximately half the water).",
    "2": "The figure indicates two important characteristics of the hydrate combustion system. One is that the ignition temperature is fairly insensitive to the water content and that there is a distinct water content that takes the adiabatic flame temperature below the ignition temperature."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately explains the necessity of water drainage for sustained flame stability in methane hydrate combustion. Key facts are correct: (1) flame temperatures don't fall below ~1700 K during steady burning, (2) this corresponds to a water/methane molar ratio (b) of around 2, (3) substantial water drainage (~half) must occur given the ideal hydrate ratio of ~5.75, and (4) without drainage, excessive water would lower flame temperature below sustainable limits. The answer correctly interprets the original text's statement that 'a practical value of b is around 2' and 'there must be a substantial water drainage (approximately half the water)'. The physical reasoning about water content reducing effective heating value and flame temperature is sound and consistent with combustion thermodynamics. The answer appropriately elaborates on the mechanism while remaining faithful to the source material.",

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly explains the core mechanism: water acts as a thermal sink, and its evaporation can lower the flame temperature below the stability limit. It accurately cites the experimental values from the original text (minimum temperature of 1700 K, practical water/methane ratio of ~2) and correctly deduces that this implies significant water drainage is necessary for sustained combustion. The logic is sound and consistent with the provided text and fundamental combustion principles.",
