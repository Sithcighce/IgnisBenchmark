  "question_text": "How do the ionic conductivity and chemical stability of Nafion membranes in vanadium redox flow batteries influence their performance characteristics, and what specific values are reported for these properties in the literature?",
  "standard_answer": "Nafion membranes exhibit excellent ionic conductivity within the range of 50-100 mS cm⁻¹, which facilitates efficient proton transport through the membrane during battery operation. This high conductivity contributes to reduced ohmic losses and improved voltage efficiency in vanadium redox flow batteries. The chemical stability of Nafion membranes is demonstrated by their ability to withstand oxidative degradation in the corrosive vanadium electrolyte environment. Specifically, Nafion membranes have been reported to reduce only 1% of the VO₂⁺ to VO²⁺ after 21 days of exposure, indicating superior chemical stability against vanadium species oxidation. This combination of properties makes Nafion membranes suitable for long-term operation in flow battery systems, though their high vanadium-ion permeability remains a challenge that requires modification strategies to optimize the balance between conductivity and crossover resistance.",

It correctly states the ionic conductivity range (50-100 mS cm⁻¹) and the chemical stability data (1% VO₂⁺ reduction to VO²⁺ after 21 days). The answer appropriately elaborates on the implications of these properties for battery performance (reduced ohmic losses, improved voltage efficiency, long-term operation capability) and mentions the vanadium-ion permeability challenge. All physical principles regarding proton transport, conductivity effects, and chemical stability are correctly stated. The elaborations beyond the original text are scientifically sound and do not contradict any established principles. No factual errors or logical inconsistencies detected.",
