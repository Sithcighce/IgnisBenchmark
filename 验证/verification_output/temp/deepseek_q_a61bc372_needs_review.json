  "question_text": "Based on the provided paper content, explain how different fuel injection strategies (direct cavity injection vs. upstream diffuser injection) affect fuel-air mixing and combustion stability in trapped vortex combustors, specifically addressing the mechanisms supported by the citations.",
  "standard_answer": "The paper identifies two primary fuel injection strategies for trapped vortex combustors with distinct effects on mixing and stability. Direct cavity injection reinforces the locked vortex when fuel is supplied in a way that strengthens the recirculation zone. Citation 1 states: 'When the fuel is injected directly into the cavity, it is desirable to supply the fuel in such way that the locked vortex in the cavity is reinforced.' This reinforcement stabilizes combustion by maintaining the vortex that anchors the flame. Additionally, direct injection promotes fuel-air mixing as 'the fuel-air mixing in the cavity will be promoted, as the bypass air is directly added into the cavity.' The stable recirculation zone, shielded from the main flow, enables combustion stability even with high-speed inflows. In contrast, upstream diffuser injection pre-mixes fuel and air before entry into the combustor, as noted in Citation 1: 'Injecting from the diffuser leads to the fuel being mixed with the air before it enters the combustor.' This pre-mixing can enhance uniformity but may not directly reinforce the cavity vortex. The location of direct injection is critical; for example, in single vortex designs, 'the fuel injectors are located just above the centerline of the front face of the cavity' (Citation 2), and variations in placement can significantly impact performance, underscoring the importance of precise injection positioning for optimal stability and mixing.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately represents the information from the original text and demonstrates sound understanding of trapped vortex combustor fuel injection strategies. All direct quotes are accurate. The answer correctly explains that direct cavity injection reinforces the locked vortex and promotes fuel-air mixing, while upstream diffuser injection pre-mixes fuel and air before combustor entry. The discussion of injection location criticality is supported by Citation 2. The physical mechanisms described (vortex reinforcement, recirculation zone stabilization, flame anchoring) are consistent with combustion science principles. The answer provides appropriate elaboration beyond the original text (e.g., explaining how stable recirculation enables combustion stability with high-speed inflows) without introducing factual errors. No contradictions with the original text or logical inconsistencies are present.",
