  "question_text": "Calculate the expected capacity reduction for a Li-ion cell operating at -10°C compared to 25°C, given that the activation energy for the dominant rate-limiting process is 50 kJ/mol and the reference temperature is 25°C. Explain the physical significance of your calculation.",
  "standard_answer": "Using the Arrhenius relationship for reaction rates: k = A exp(-E_A/RT), the ratio of rates at two temperatures is k₂/k₁ = exp[(E_A/R)(1/T₁ - 1/T₂)]. For E_A = 50,000 J/mol, R = 8.314 J/mol·K, T₁ = 298 K (25°C), T₂ = 263 K (-10°C): k₂/k₁ = exp[(50000/8.314)(1/298 - 1/263)] = exp[6013.7 × (0.003356 - 0.003802)] = exp[6013.7 × (-0.000446)] = exp[-2.682] = 0.068. This indicates the rate-limiting process operates at only 6.8% of its room temperature rate at -10°C. Physically, this substantial reduction reflects the dramatic slowing of lithium diffusion and charge transfer kinetics at lower temperatures. The capacity reduction arises because the slower kinetics create larger overpotentials during discharge, causing the cell voltage to reach the cutoff limit earlier. The calculation assumes the rate-limiting process dominates capacity accessibility and doesn't account for additional factors like electrolyte freezing or changes in internal resistance. In practice, the actual capacity reduction may be less severe due to self-heating during high-rate discharge, but this calculation demonstrates the fundamental temperature dependence of electrochemical processes governing cell performance.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "The reaction rate of lithium insertion is believed to have an Arrhenius dependence on temperature (T)",
    "2": "Higher temperatures cause both ion mobility and solid-state diffusion to improve, thus reducing a cell's internal impedance and overpotential. This means that a cell can discharge more capacity before the lower voltage limit is reached"

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly applies the Arrhenius relationship to calculate the rate reduction (to 6.8% at -10°C vs 25°C). The mathematical calculation is accurate: exp[-2.682] ≈ 0.068. The physical interpretation is consistent with the original text - it correctly explains that lower temperatures reduce ion mobility and diffusion (slowing kinetics), which increases overpotential and causes the cell to reach cutoff voltage earlier, reducing accessible capacity. The answer appropriately acknowledges limitations (doesn't account for electrolyte freezing, self-heating effects) and correctly identifies the fundamental Arrhenius temperature dependence mentioned in the original text. All physical principles are stated correctly and the causal relationships are sound.",

        "reasoning": "Arrhenius relation and numerical calculation are correct, yielding ~6.8% of the room-temperature rate at -10°C. The physical explanation—slower kinetics increase overpotentials, causing earlier cutoff and reduced accessible capacity—is consistent with the original text (Arrhenius dependence and improved mobility/diffusion at higher T lowering impedance/overpotential). The caveat about practical deviations is appropriate.",
