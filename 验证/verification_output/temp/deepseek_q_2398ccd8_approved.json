  "question_text": "Based on the provided paper content, explain the specific mechanisms through which real-gas effects and vibrational non-equilibrium influence detonation propagation limits in hydrogen-air mixtures, including how these non-ideal effects alter the thermodynamic properties, energy distribution, and stability boundaries of detonation waves under near-limit conditions.",
  "standard_answer": "The paper discusses that real-gas effects become significant at high pressures where the ideal gas assumption breaks down, requiring more complex equations of state to accurately describe the thermodynamic properties. Specifically, 'Real-gas effects' modify the equation of state and thermodynamic properties of the gas mixture, which affects the detonation structure and propagation limits by altering the compressibility factor and specific heat ratios. This influences the Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) conditions and the energy available to sustain the detonation wave. For vibrational non-equilibrium, the paper states that 'Vibrational non-equilibrium effects' occur when the characteristic time for vibrational energy transfer in molecules like nitrogen and oxygen becomes comparable to the detonation reaction time scale, preventing full thermal equilibrium in the reaction zone. This delays energy release and redistributes internal energy, reducing the effective energy supporting the detonation front and increasing the critical energy required for sustained propagation. These mechanisms are particularly relevant for 'Propagation under loss conditions and detonation limits' where energy losses and non-equilibrium processes can lead to detonation failure, as they modify the thermal structure and energy balance within the detonation wave, ultimately impacting stability boundaries and critical conditions for propagation.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately explains the mechanisms through which real-gas effects and vibrational non-equilibrium influence detonation propagation. It correctly states that real-gas effects modify equations of state and thermodynamic properties (compressibility factor, specific heat ratios) affecting CJ conditions and energy availability, which aligns with the original text. The explanation of vibrational non-equilibrium correctly describes the time scale comparison preventing thermal equilibrium, delaying energy release, and redistributing internal energy. The connection to propagation limits and detonation failure under loss conditions is properly established. All physical principles are sound, cause-effect relationships are correct, and there are no contradictions with the original text. The answer appropriately elaborates on the original text by explaining specific mechanisms (CJ conditions, energy redistribution, thermal structure) without introducing factual errors.",

        "reasoning": "The answer accurately reflects the original text: it states that real-gas effects at high pressure require non-ideal equations of state and modify thermodynamic properties, impacting CJ conditions and detonation sustainability; and that vibrational non-equilibrium arises from comparable vibrational relaxation and reaction timescales, delaying energy release and redistributing internal energy, which can push the system toward detonation failure under near-limit, loss-influenced conditions. The elaborations on compressibility factor, specific heat ratio, CJ conditions, and increased critical energy are consistent with established detonation physics and do not contradict the provided ground truth.",
