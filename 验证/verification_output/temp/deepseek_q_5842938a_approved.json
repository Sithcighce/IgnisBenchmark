  "question_text": "How does the critical viscosity model differentiate between sticking and rebound of ash particles, and what are the limitations of applying viscosity-based criteria to salt-rich biomass ashes?",
  "standard_answer": "The critical viscosity model establishes a threshold viscosity (typically around 10^4 to 10^5 Pa·s) below which particles stick due to sufficient energy dissipation via viscous flow. For silicate-rich coal ashes, sticking occurs when viscosity is low enough to allow plastic deformation upon impact, absorbing kinetic energy. However, for salt-rich biomass ashes (e.g., high in K, Cl, S), viscosity is not the dominant stickiness parameter because these particles often have a solid phase with a liquid melt fraction. Their stickiness is better described by the liquid melt fraction criterion, where a critical melt fraction (e.g., 15-30%) must be exceeded for adhesion. Viscosity models fail for salt-rich ashes due to empirical correlations being valid only in narrow silicate compositional ranges and inability to capture the phase behavior of salts, which may form low-melting eutectics without significant viscosity reduction predictive by silicate models.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "The main properties affecting the particle stickiness are the viscosity and surface tension for silicate-rich ashes. On the contrary, the stickiness of salt-rich ashes – typical for herbaceous biomass and wood- or waste-based fuels – is often described using the liquid melt fraction.",
    "2": "Biomass ashes and their stickiness are more difficult, due to a different ash particle chemistry, compared to coal ashes. Salt-rich particles and their stickiness are controlled by the amount of liquid phase."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer correctly explains the critical viscosity model for silicate-rich ashes (threshold of 10^4 to 10^5 Pa·s for sticking via viscous flow and plastic deformation) and accurately identifies that salt-rich biomass ashes are better described by liquid melt fraction criteria rather than viscosity. This aligns perfectly with the original text stating that viscosity/surface tension govern silicate-rich ash stickiness while liquid melt fraction controls salt-rich ash stickiness. The answer correctly explains the limitations: empirical viscosity correlations are valid only for narrow silicate compositional ranges and cannot capture salt phase behavior including low-melting eutectics. The physical principles are sound, the cause-effect relationships are correct, and there are no contradictions with the original text. The answer is detailed but all statements are factually accurate.",
