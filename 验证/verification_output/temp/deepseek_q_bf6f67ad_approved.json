  "question_text": "Based on the provided paper content, how do methane or hydrogen additions to ammonia/air mixtures extend the stable combustion region in swirl combustors, and what general mechanisms are mentioned for this stabilization enhancement?",
  "standard_answer": "According to the paper, methane/hydrogen addition to ammonia/air mixtures extends the stable combustion region in swirl combustors through general mechanisms that improve flame resistance to flow disturbances and increase key radical concentrations at the flame base. The paper states that 'These measures mainly improve the flame resistance to the flow and increase the key radicals at flame base, which may provide possible solutions to the combustion chamber design.' Additionally, the paper specifically notes that 'The extension of stable region ... Methane/hydrogen addition ...' as one of the approaches for enhancing flame stability. While the paper confirms that methane and hydrogen additions do extend the stable operating range of ammonia flames in swirl combustors, it does not provide detailed chemical reaction pathways or specific fluid dynamic mechanisms beyond these general concepts of improved flow resistance and increased radical concentrations.",
