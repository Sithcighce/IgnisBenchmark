  "question_text": "How does the presence of moisture in flue gas enhance SO2 adsorption on biochar through both physical and chemical mechanisms, and what role does the formation of a liquid membrane play?",
  "standard_answer": "Moisture enhances SO2 adsorption on biochar through multiple mechanisms. Physically, water vapor accumulates on biochar surfaces and pores, forming a liquid membrane that facilitates SO2 dissolution, increasing its concentration at active sites and promoting diffusion into micropores. Chemically, the adsorbed water reacts with SO2 and oxygen to form sulfuric acid (H2SO4) via oxidation to SO3, which then hydrates. This acid can further react with inorganic components in biochar, such as calcium oxides, to form stable sulfates, enhancing chemisorption. The liquid membrane acts as a medium for these reactions, improving mass transfer and providing a pathway for SO2 to access internal pores and functional groups. However, excessive humidity (>50%) can reduce adsorption by blocking pores or competing for active sites, highlighting an optimal moisture range for maximum efficiency.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "The H2O accumulated on the surface and interior pores of biochar favors the formation of a liquid membrane which would lead to the SO2 adsorbed by biochar easier than the adsorption in gas-solid reaction.",
    "2": "If the SO2, O2, and H2O were all adsorbed on the surface of biochar, the SO2 was first physically adsorbed onto the biochar, then oxidized to SO3 and transformed to H2SO4."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately describes the moisture-enhanced SO2 adsorption mechanisms on biochar. It correctly explains: (1) Physical mechanism - water vapor forms a liquid membrane facilitating SO2 dissolution and diffusion, consistent with original text [1]; (2) Chemical mechanism - SO2 oxidation to SO3 followed by H2SO4 formation, matching original text [2]; (3) The role of liquid membrane in mass transfer and reaction pathways. The additional details about calcium oxide reactions and optimal humidity range (>50% reducing efficiency) represent reasonable extensions based on combustion science principles and do not contradict the original text. All physical and chemical principles are correctly stated.",

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly captures both physical and chemical mechanisms consistent with the ground truth: moisture accumulates to form a liquid membrane that facilitates SO2 dissolution and adsorption, and co-adsorbed SO2 is oxidized to SO3 and then hydrated to H2SO4. The role of the liquid membrane as a reaction medium and mass transfer facilitator is accurately described. The added note on reaction of H2SO4 with inorganic ash (e.g., CaO) to form sulfates is plausible and commonly reported. The only concern is the unsubstantiated specific humidity threshold, which is extraneous to the provided text.",
