  "standard_answer": "Calculation: τign = 3.7 × 10^(-6) × (20)^(-0.5) × (0.5)^(-0.4) × (0.18)^(-5.4) × exp(12500/(8.314 × 1000)) = 3.7 × 10^(-6) × 0.2236 × 1.3195 × 173.78 × exp(1.503) = 3.7 × 10^(-6) × 0.2236 × 1.3195 × 173.78 × 4.493 = 3.7 × 10^(-6) × 230.8 = 0.000854 ms = 0.854 ms. The physical significance of each parameter: P^(-0.5) represents the pressure dependence where increasing pressure generally decreases ignition delay due to higher collision frequencies, though this exponent reflects the complex pressure effects observed in syngas ignition. ϕ^(-0.4) indicates that richer mixtures have shorter ignition delays due to higher fuel concentration and reaction rates. χO2^(-5.4) shows strong dependence on oxygen concentration, with higher oxygen significantly reducing ignition delay by promoting oxidation reactions. The exponential term exp(12500/RT) represents the Arrhenius temperature dependence, where 12500 J/mol is the apparent activation energy, and increasing temperature exponentially decreases ignition delay by accelerating reaction rates through increased molecular kinetic energy.",

The actual product of 0.2236 × 1.3195 × 173.78 × 4.493 ≈ 230.8 appears correct, but converting to milliseconds: 3.7 × 10^(-6) × 230.8 ≈ 8.54 × 10^(-4) seconds = 0.854 ms.
