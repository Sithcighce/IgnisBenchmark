  "question_text": "Based on the provided paper content, explain the combustion performance characteristics of 2-methylfuran (2-MF) and 2,5-dimethylfuran (2,5-DMF) as potential biofuels for gasoline engines, focusing specifically on their boiling points, lower heating values, and octane numbers compared to conventional fuels and other biofuels. Include the chemical reasoning behind why these properties make them suitable as octane-boosting additives.",
  "standard_answer": "According to the paper, 2-MF and 2,5-DMF exhibit specific combustion performance characteristics that make them promising biofuel candidates for gasoline engines. Their boiling points fall below 370 K, which places them within the typical gasoline boiling range (303-473 K), ensuring proper vaporization in spark-ignition engines. The mass lower heating values (LHV) of both furan derivatives are above that of n-butanol (26.8 MJ/kg), making them competitive despite their oxygen content. Most importantly, both compounds have Research Octane Numbers (RON) above 100, with 2,5-DMF specifically having a RON of 119, which is very close to ethanol's RON of 120. This indicates similar resistance to auto-ignition as ethanol. The high RON values result from their molecular structure as furan derivatives, which provides excellent anti-knock properties. These combined properties - appropriate boiling range, competitive energy density, and superior octane ratings - make 2-MF and 2,5-DMF particularly interesting as potential octane-boosting additives in gasoline blends, offering performance comparable to established oxygenated biofuels like ethanol while being derived from lignocellulosic biomass.",
