  "question_text": "Explain the energy-based model for particle sticking in gas turbine applications, detailing how the energy balance determines whether a particle rebounds or adheres upon impact. Describe the key energy components involved and the physical mechanisms of energy dissipation during particle deformation.",
  "standard_answer": "The energy-based model for particle sticking evaluates whether a particle will adhere to a surface or rebound by comparing the initial kinetic energy before impact to the energy dissipated during deformation and adhesion processes. The model predicts sticking occurs when all available kinetic energy is fully dissipated through deformation work and adhesion energy, leaving no residual energy for rebound. Key energy components include the particle's kinetic energy, viscous dissipation during deformation, and surface energy changes associated with wetting and interface formation. The main parameters governing this energy balance are the particle's viscosity, surface tension, kinetic energy, and the surface energy or contact angle with the substrate. Physically, when a particle impacts a surface, its kinetic energy is converted into work against viscous forces during deformation and work against surface tension to expand the particle-substrate interface area. If the combined energy dissipation through viscous effects and surface energy changes equals or exceeds the initial kinetic energy, the particle lacks sufficient energy to separate from the surface and thus adheres. This deterministic approach provides a fundamental physical basis for predicting particle deposition behavior in gas turbine environments where contaminants impact hot surfaces.",

    "1": "The model predicts sticking if all the available energy is dissipated to deform the particle and to adhere to the surface. The main parameters are the kinetic energy of the particle, its viscosity and surface tension, and the surface energy or contact angle",
    "2": "From a physical point of view, the conditions for adhesion, rebound or break-up are determined by how much of the initial kinetic energy of the particle is absorbed by the deformation work upon impact and by the adhesion energy with the substrate and how much is still available to remove the particle, or its fragments, from the wall."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately explains the energy-based model for particle sticking and is fully consistent with the original text. It correctly identifies that sticking occurs when kinetic energy is fully dissipated through deformation work and adhesion processes. The key energy components (kinetic energy, viscous dissipation, surface energy changes) are correctly stated and match the original text's mention of 'deformation work' and 'adhesion energy with the substrate'. The main parameters listed (viscosity, surface tension, kinetic energy, surface energy/contact angle) directly correspond to those in the original text. The physical mechanism described—where kinetic energy converts to work against viscous forces and surface tension during deformation—is physically sound and consistent with the original text's statement about energy absorption during impact. The deterministic approach and application context (gas turbine environments) are appropriate elaborations that don't contradict the source material.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately paraphrases the energy-based sticking criterion: sticking occurs when the particle’s kinetic energy is fully dissipated via deformation work and adhesion energy, leaving insufficient energy for rebound. It correctly identifies key parameters (kinetic energy, viscosity, surface tension, surface energy/contact angle) and describes physical dissipation mechanisms (viscous deformation and surface energy changes). There are no contradictions with the original text, and the causal logic is sound.",
