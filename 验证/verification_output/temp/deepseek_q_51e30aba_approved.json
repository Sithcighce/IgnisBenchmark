  "question_text": "How do multi-scale transport phenomena influence the performance of biomass fast pyrolysis reactors, and what are the key challenges in modeling these phenomena across different length scales?",
  "standard_answer": "Multi-scale transport phenomena significantly constrain pyrolysis reactor performance by governing heat and mass transfer across molecular, particle, and reactor scales. At the molecular scale, transport limitations affect reaction kinetics and product distribution, while particle-scale phenomena control heating rates and volatile release through intra-particle heat conduction and mass diffusion. Reactor-scale hydrodynamics, including gas-solid flow patterns and residence time distributions, determine overall heat transfer efficiency and product yields. The pyrolysis reactions are highly constrained by the transport phenomena, creating complex interactions between reaction kinetics and physical transport processes. In-depth understanding of the reaction mechanisms and kinetics should be combined with the knowledge of multi-scale transport phenomena to enable design, optimization, and control of complex pyrolysis reactors. Computational modeling faces significant challenges in capturing these multi-scale interactions, as reactor-scale flow fields must be coupled with particle-level reactions while managing computational complexities. The inherent multi-scale nature requires integrating molecular-level characterization with reactor-scale hydrodynamics, making model validation and scale-up particularly challenging for different reactor configurations.",

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately addresses multi-scale transport phenomena in biomass fast pyrolysis reactors. It correctly identifies the three key scales (molecular, particle, and reactor) and their respective transport limitations. The answer is fully consistent with the original text, correctly stating that 'pyrolysis reactions are highly constrained by the transport phenomena' and that 'in-depth understanding of reaction mechanisms and kinetics should be combined with knowledge of multi-scale transport phenomena.' The physical principles are sound: heat/mass transfer limitations at particle scale, reaction kinetics at molecular scale, and hydrodynamics at reactor scale are all correctly described. The discussion of computational modeling challenges and the need to couple different scales is logically consistent and reflects established understanding in the field. While the answer is detailed, all statements are factually accurate and there are no contradictions with the original text or fundamental combustion/thermophysics principles.",
