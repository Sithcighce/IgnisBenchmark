  "question_text": "How do the morphological differences between gel-type and macroporous sulphonated polystyrene resins affect their catalytic performance in FFA esterification, particularly regarding water tolerance and deactivation mechanisms, and what are the underlying mass transfer and swelling phenomena?",
  "standard_answer": "Gel-type and macroporous sulphonated polystyrene resins exhibit fundamentally different catalytic behaviors in FFA esterification due to their distinct morphological characteristics and interaction with water. Gel-type resins, characterized by low crosslinking, possess minimal surface area in the dry state but undergo significant swelling in appropriate solvents, creating accessible porous structures that facilitate reactant diffusion to acid sites. This swelling enhances initial catalytic activity by improving mass transfer of hydrophobic FFA molecules. However, gel-types demonstrate superior water tolerance compared to macroporous resins. The permanent porous structure of macroporous resins, with their high surface area and wide pore size distribution, leads to greater water adsorption capacity within the pore network. This results in more pronounced deactivation as water molecules preferentially adsorb on the catalyst surface, forming hydrated protons that block access to acid sites and hinder FFA diffusion. The underlying mechanism involves competitive adsorption where water, being more polar, displaces the hydrophobic FFA tails from the catalytic sites. Mass transfer limitations become more severe in macroporous systems under high water conditions due to pore blockage, while gel-types maintain better accessibility despite swelling effects. The swelling degree inversely relates to crosslinker content, directly impacting reaction kinetics through changes in pore volume and diffusion pathways.",
  "original_text": {
    "1": "gel-type resins are able to swell in “good” solvents (i.e. solvents with solubility parameters similar to that of the polymer), giving rise to a porous structure and becoming readily accessible.",
    "2": "macroporous resins can have much higher surface area in the dry state (50–100 m²g⁻¹)... and tend to exhibit a wide pore size distribution ranging from micropores (<20 Å) to mesopores (20–500 Å) to macropores (>500 Å).",
    "3": "Resins showing a permanent porous structure seem to deactivate more easily than gel-type resins, due to their greater capacity to adsorb the water."

        "reasoning": "The standard answer accurately reflects all key points from the original text: (1) gel-type resins swell in appropriate solvents to create accessible porous structures, (2) macroporous resins have permanent porous structures with high surface area and wide pore size distribution, and (3) macroporous resins deactivate more easily than gel-types due to greater water adsorption capacity. The answer correctly explains the underlying mechanisms including competitive adsorption, mass transfer limitations, and the relationship between crosslinking and swelling. The physical and chemical principles are sound, including the explanation of how water's polarity leads to preferential adsorption and site blocking. While the answer is detailed and elaborates beyond the original text, all statements are consistent with established catalysis and polymer science principles. No factual errors or logical contradictions were identified.",

The added explanations on mass transfer, competitive adsorption, and swelling are consistent and physically plausible. Minor speculative or generalized details do not contradict the source.",
