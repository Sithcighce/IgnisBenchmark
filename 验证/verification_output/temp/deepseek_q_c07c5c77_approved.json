  "question_text": "Calculate the adiabatic flame temperature for H₂S combustion in air at stoichiometric conditions, given that the heat of combustion for H₂S is -518 kJ/mol and the product species include SO₂, H₂O, and N₂. Assume constant specific heats: Cp,SO₂ = 50 J/mol·K, Cp,H₂O = 40 J/mol·K, Cp,N₂ = 30 J/mol·K, and an initial temperature of 298 K. Explain the energy balance methodology and discuss how this calculation relates to industrial sulfur recovery unit (SRU) furnace design, citing relevant mechanisms from the provided paper.",
  "standard_answer": "The stoichiometric reaction for H₂S combustion in air is: H₂S + 1.5O₂ + 5.64N₂ → SO₂ + H₂O + 5.64N₂. The nitrogen calculation is based on air composition (79% N₂, 21% O₂), giving 1.5 × (79/21) = 5.64 mol N₂ per mole H₂S. The heat released per mole of H₂S is 518,000 J. The total moles of products are 1 (SO₂) + 1 (H₂O) + 5.64 (N₂) = 7.64 mol. The average Cp of products is calculated as: (1×50 + 1×40 + 5.64×30)/7.64 = (50 + 40 + 169.2)/7.64 = 259.2/7.64 = 33.93 J/mol·K. Using the energy balance: Q = n·Cp·ΔT, 518,000 J = 7.64 mol × 33.93 J/mol·K × (T_f - 298 K). Solving for T_f: T_f = 298 + 518,000/(7.64×33.93) = 298 + 518,000/259.2 = 298 + 1998.5 = 2296.5 K. This high temperature reflects the exothermicity of H₂S oxidation. In industrial SRU furnaces, this calculation provides the theoretical maximum temperature, but actual temperatures are moderated by heat losses and complex reaction pathways. The paper discusses that 'In the furnace, H₂S is firstly converted to SO₂ through the exothermic reaction, H₂S + 1.5O₂ → SO₂ + H₂O, and then the unreacted H₂S undergoes further reaction with the formed SO₂ through the Claus reaction, 2H₂S + SO₂ ⇌ 1.5S₂ + 2H₂O at temperatures above 1000°C.' Additionally, 'The heat of formation of SO₂ in the H₂S combustion with O₂ to produce SO₂ is removed, if SO₂ is produced externally and is instead introduced as a feed stream.' These mechanisms illustrate how industrial processes manage the high temperatures predicted by adiabatic flame calculations through staged reactions and feed stream management.",

        "reasoning": "The answer correctly performs the adiabatic flame temperature calculation with proper stoichiometry (H₂S + 1.5O₂ + 5.64N₂ → SO₂ + H₂O + 5.64N₂), accurate nitrogen calculation from air composition, correct energy balance methodology (Q = n·Cp·ΔT), and arrives at a reasonable temperature of 2296.5 K. The mathematical steps are sound: average Cp = 33.93 J/mol·K, ΔT = 1998.5 K. The industrial SRU discussion accurately references both original text passages, correctly explaining the two-stage process (H₂S oxidation to SO₂ followed by Claus reaction) and the heat management strategy when SO₂ is externally introduced. The answer properly connects theoretical adiabatic calculations to practical furnace design considerations. All physical principles, chemical equations, and thermodynamic relationships are correct and consistent with the original text.",
