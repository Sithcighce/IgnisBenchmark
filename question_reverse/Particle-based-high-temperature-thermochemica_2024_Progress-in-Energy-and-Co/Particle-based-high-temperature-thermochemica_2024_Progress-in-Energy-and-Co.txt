Solar  and  other  renewable  energy  driven  gas-solid  thermochemical  energy  storage  (TCES)  technology  is  a
promising solution for the next generation energy storage systems due to its high operating temperature, efficient
energy conversion, ultra-long storage duration, and potential high energy density. Experimental and theoretical
studies suggest that the respective gravimetric and volumetric TCES energy storage densities vary from 200 to
(cid:0) 3. Solar radiation or heat generated from electric furnaces powered by renewable
3000 kJ kg
electricity  can  be  stored  in  the  form  of  chemical  energy  through  endothermic  reactions,  while  the  stored
chemical energy can be converted to thermal energy via an exothermic reaction when needed. The design of
highly  effective  reactors requires  a deep  understanding  of  materials, thermodynamics,  chemical  kinetics,  and
transport phenomena. At time of writing, TCES reactors are yet to be deployed at commercially relevant scales,
leaving a substantial gap between development efforts and commercial feasibility. Therefore, this review aims to
examine  the  state-of-the-art  design  and  performance  of  particle-based  TCES  reactors  with  different  reactive
materials. Fundamentals related to TCES reactive materials, reaction conditions, thermodynamics and kinetics,
and transport phenomena are reviewed in detail to provide a comprehensive understanding of the reactor design
and operation. Five major types of TCES reactors have been comprehensively reviewed and compared, including
fixed, moving, rotary, fluidized, and entrained bed reactors. Most reported prototype reactors in the literature
operate at lab scale with thermal inputs below 40 kW, and scaled TCES reactors (e.g., at megawatt level) are yet
to be demonstrated. The nominal reactor operating temperatures range from 300 to 1500
C, depending on the
selected chemistry, reactive material, and heat sources. To evaluate their designs, the reactors are assessed in
aspects of performance, cost, and durability. Discrepancies in performance indicators of energy storage density,
extent  of  reaction,  and  various  energy  efficiencies  are  highlighted.  The  scale-up  of  reactors  and  power  block
integration,  which  hold  the key  to  the  successful  commercialization of  TCES systems,  are  critically analyzed.
Advanced  materials  (both  reactive  materials  and  ceramic  reactor  housing  materials),  effective  particle  flow
control,  advanced modeling tools, and novel  system design  may bring  significant improvement  to the energy
efficiency, storage density and cost competitiveness of particle-based TCES reactors.

1. Introduction

Renewable energy of various forms such as solar photovoltaics (PV),
concentrating  solar  power  (CSP),  onshore  and  offshore  wind,  hydro-
power, geothermal and bioenergy power generation represents a vital
pillar in the global effort to drastically reduce and ultimately completely
replace fossil fuels. This will not only increase national energy security

and  resilience,  but  also  leads  the  transition  to  a  clean  and  net-zero
decarbonized  global  future  energy  system,  with  the  goal  of  limiting

utility-scale solar PV projects declined by 88 % between 2010 and 2021,
while onshore wind fell by 68 %, CSP by 67 %, and offshore wind by 60
%  [1].  On  the  other  hand,  the  inherent  challenges  associated  with
renewable  energy  including  high  intermittency,  seasonal  variability,
geographical dependence, and mismatch between supply and demand
necessitate high-efficiency, scalable and cost-competitive energy storage
technologies. Typical energy storage technologies include, but are not
limited to, battery storage, pumped hydro storage, compressed air en-
ergy storage, flywheel energy storage, hydrogen storage, and thermal
energy storage (TES), each serving unique applications and contributing
to a more resilient energy infrastructure. Among those, TES technologies
with sensible, latent, or thermochemical modes are particularly attrac-
tive as it can be integrated into a turbine-based power block for elec-
tricity  generation  or  directly  used  as  industrial  process  heat  in  the
discharge unit; for charging, the versatile heat input could be from solar
thermal, geothermal, or electric furnaces powered by excess electricity
from any renewables.

TES of CSP represents one of those extensively studied and promising
technologies explored worldwide. A CSP plant uses an array of lenses or
mirrors  (heliostats)  to  concentrate  terrestrial  solar  radiation  onto  a
focused  area  to  produce  heat,  which  is  subsequently  converted  into
useful work or consumed as industrial process heat [2,3]. By utilizing
the entire spectrum of solar light, CSP can be operated at extremely high
temperature, which is favorable in applications of solar fuel production
[4], power generation [5,6], and energy storage [7,8], as higher oper-
ating temperatures correspond to higher power block efficiencies in the
downstream and a wider temperature range of industrial processes (e.g.,
from space heating to water heating to manufacturing of steel, chem-
icals, and cement around 1500
C). Solar energy storage has attracted

◦

particular attention recently due to its centralized electricity generation,
potential long storage duration, and LCOE [7,9]. A solar energy storage
system  is  typically  composed  of  a  solar  concentrator-receiver  unit,  a
charging unit, a discharging unit, and a power block. Due to the inter-
mittent availability of solar energy, CSP can concentrate the sunlight in
the daytime to create a high flux of thermal heat that can be used to
charge TES systems [10,11], during which the solar energy is stored in
the form of sensible heat, latent heat, or chemical energy. When elec-
tricity is needed, the stored energy is discharged, and electricity can be
generated by a power block [12,13].

The solar concentrator and receiver unit can be primarily classified
as
the
line-  and  point-focused  configurations  depending  on
concentrator-receiver  configuration  [14,16]  (see  Fig.  1  a).  The
line-focused system can concentrate the sunlight on a line via parabolic
troughs or liner Fresnel reflectors, while the point-focused system can
concentrate the solar beams on a point via a central receiver, a parabolic
dish, or a beam-down reflector [17]. Many solar power plants have been
built  in  the  past  two  decades  primarily  in  Spain,  the  United  States,
China, and other sunbelt regions. Among these solar plants, parabolic
trough is the relatively mature technology to harvest solar power, ac-
counting  for  64.1  %  of  total  solar  plants  that  are  operational,
non-operational,  decommissioned,  and  under  construction,  while  the
rest are 10.6 % liner Fresnel, 22.5 % central receiver, 1.4 % parabolic
dish, and 1.4 % beam-down systems (see Fig. 1 b) [15]. With the re-
ported  heat  transfer  fluids  of  thermal  oil  and  organics  (e.g.,  Diphe-
nyl/Biphenyl oxide pair), the operating temperature of parabolic trough

C. It should be noted that with molten salts and

air as the heat transfer fluids, the operating temperature can be as high
as 566 and 700
C, respectively. Although beam-down reflectors have
been employed in many lab-scale studies to achieve high temperatures
(see  Ref.  [17]  for  the  state-of-the-art  progresses  of  beam-down  solar
systems), which is preferable for certain TCES reactions, their applica-
tion  in  large-scale  solar  plants  is  limited  (e.g.,  one  50  MW  is  being
operational since 2021 [15]). Among these configurations, the central
receivers  have  attracted  significant  attention  in  recently  developed
CSP-based TES systems because of their relatively large power genera-
tion  capacity  (e.g.,  10–200  MW),  large  concentration  ratio  (e.g.,
◦
300–1000), and high achievable temperature (e.g., over 1000
C), which
is  favorable  for  many  particular  thermal  reduction  reactions  that  can
enable  extremely  long  energy  storage  duration  [19].  This  is  reflected
from Fig. 1 b that 37.0 % of the projects under construction are central
receiver  tower,  followed  by  24.7  %  parabolic  trough,  24.7  %  linear
Fresnel,  12.3  %  beam-down  system,  and  1.2  %  parabolic  dish  [15].
When CSP is harnessed for power generation, a higher operating tem-
perature  can  lead  to  enhanced  thermal  efficiency  of  the  power  block
[20]. A detailed review of mathematical models for different types of
solar concentrators and receivers can be found in Refs. [3,21], which is
not the focus of the present study.

The  charging  unit  in  a  TES  system  can  be  classified  based  on  the
energy storage materials and physicochemical phenomena as sensible,
latent, and thermochemical types [14,22], as shown in Fig. 2. The sen-
sible heat storage system utilizes the temperature rise and fall of storage
materials (usually liquid or solid; e.g., molten salts, rocks, concrete, and
sand) to store and release thermal heat, respectively, while the latent
heat storage system charge and discharge thermal heat through phase
changes of the storage medium (mostly liquid-solid phase change; e.g.,
salts, metals, and organic materials) [7]. Thermochemical energy stor-
age (TCES) utilizes endothermic and exothermic reactions to store and
release energy, respectively. A typical TCES cycle involves three steps –
charging,  storage,  and  discharging.  At  the  charging  stage,  an  endo-
thermic chemical reaction is utilized to absorb the heat generated from
CSP or electric furnaces powered by renewable electricity. The thermal
energy  is  transferred  and  stored  in  rearranged  chemical  compounds,
which  can  be  stably  kept  in  a  container  for  an  extended  period.  By

implementing  effective  preheating  and  recuperation  strategies,  it  is
possible to keep the temperature of reactants close to ambient levels,
thereby  minimizing  heat  losses  throughout  the  storage  process  [23].
When energy is needed, heat will be discharged through an exothermic
reaction of the stored chemicals [24]. Therefore, compared with sensible
and latent heat storage, TCES is advantageous in terms of high energy
density,  low  storage  volume,  compact  system  design,  potential  low
storage temperature, low heat dissipation during storage, and diverse
energy sources from both renewables and non-renewables alike [25].
TCES materials can be typically classified according to the physico-
chemical phenomena into two categories –  sorption and reaction [25,
26].  The  sorption  TCES  system  stores  thermal  heat  through  the  ab-
sorption or adsorption reaction of chemicals (see Fig. 3). Absorption is
an interfacial phenomenon where one substance enters the bulk volume
of  another  substance  in  a  different  state,  where  cohesive  forces,
including hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces, play a significant
role. During the absorption process, the molecular configuration of the
compounds does not change. Many absorption types of materials have
been  investigated  for  TCES  systems,  while  only  a  few  were  tested  in
prototypes.  Typical  absorption  types  of  TCES  material  pairs  include
LiBr/H2O,  NH3/H2O,  LiCl/H2O  and  CaCl2/H2O  [27].  Different  from
absorption,  adsorption  involves  the  adhesion  of  one  substance  to  the
surface of another. The most common adsorption types of TCES mate-
rials include silica gel/H2O and Zeolite/H2O, which have been practi-
cally used in many chillers and heat pumps, which can be extended in
TCES applications [27]. Reaction-based TCES systems, however, utilize
endothermic  chemical  reactions  to  store  heat  during  charging  and
exothermic reactions to release heat during discharging. For instance, a
type A-B chemical compound can be split into A and B with sufficient
heat input at elevated temperatures, which is essential to break the A-B
chemical bonds. By separating the reaction products, A and B, the en-
ergy stored in the chemical bonds can last for any length of time if A and
B are stored properly, meaning that heat losses only occur during the
charging and discharging steps.

Typical  TCES  energy  storage  materials  include  solid-state  salt  hy-
drates, ammonium chlorides, metal hydrides, metal hydroxides, metal
carbonates,  and  metal  oxides  [29–37].  As  an  example,  Fig.  4

demonstrates  a  solid-particle-based  TCES  system  that  can  benefit
different end users due to its long storage duration and convenience for
transportation [28]. It is emphasized that in addition to CSP, the solid
particle  energy  carriers  can  also  be  charged  by  an  electric  furnace
powered by electricity generated from wind farms, PV fields, industrial
waste heat, or many other renewable sources. The charged particles can
be  dispatched  to  different  end  users  on  demand,  such  as  industrial
plants,  power  plants,  Peaker  plants,  urban  combined  heat  and  power
(CHP), remote mining CHP, and marine transportation (propulsion) by
various means of transportation, e.g., railroad or trucking.

The  present  study  focuses  on  solid  particle-based  TCES  systems.  It
should be noted that many efforts have been devoted to two-step H2O/CO2
splitting, in which the solid reactive materials are firstly thermally reduced
in  a  solar  reactor  and  then  oxidized  by  H2O  and/or  CO2  to  generate
gaseous fuels, e.g., H2 and/or CO [38–42]. Typical reactive materials are

ZnO  and  CeO2,  representing  two  types  of  reactions  depending  on  the
product state. Solid ZnO powders can be reduced in a high-temperature
reactor  with  or  without  assistance  of  charcoal  [43]  or  CO  [38],  gener-
ating gaseous product Zn in the vapor phase. Zn vapor is then condensed in
a quench device and can be further employed to split H2O and/or CO2 [44,
45]. In contrary, solid CeO2, made either in particle forms or reticulated
porous  ceramic  (RPC)  structures  [46,47],  can  be  reduced  to  an
oxygen-deficient  state  CeO2-δ  in  a  high-temperature  reactor,  and  the
product CeO2-δ  remains  solid and can  be oxidized by  H2O  and/or CO2,
generating  hydrogen  or  syngas.  Although  many  of  the  reactors  can  be
modified  for  a  reversible  TCES  system,  those  solar  thermochemical  re-
actors for hydrogen and syngas production are excluded in the discussions,
such that the present review can be focused on particle-based TCES re-
actors. Interested readers can refer to Refs. [20,48] for detailed reviews of
thermochemical reactors for H2O and/or CO2 splitting.

At the charging stage, the particulate reactants can be heated up in
various modes, e.g., directly or indirectly irradiated, as shown in Fig. 5
[49,50].  In  directly  irradiated  reactors,  the  reactant  particles  are
exposed to a concentrated solar flux through an aperture with elevated
temperature and low theoretical energy losses. However, the inhomo-
geneous temperature among the particles within the entire reactor re-
mains  one  of  the  most  significant  challenges.  The  particles  should
possess good absorptivity for improved radiative heat transfer and serve
as a shield between the high-temperature particles and reactor walls to
minimize energy loss and lower wall temperature. Most directly radiated
reactors  are  enclosed  by  a  quartz  window  to  prevent  heat  and  mass
transfer between the reaction bed and the ambient environment (see the
closed system in Fig. 5). However, the quartz window must be kept clean
and uncontaminated to maximize the radiative flux into the reaction bed
and  avoid  glass  cracking  from  absorbing  excess  heat  [38].  For  some
specific reactions in which oxygen in the air does not affect the reaction
kinetics  and  products,  e.g.,  the  decomposition  of  CaCO3,  MgCO3,  Ca
(OH)2, and Mg(OH)2, the quartz window is not required, and an open
system  can  be  adopted  [51–53].  In  indirectly  irradiated  reactors,  the
particles are not directly exposed to the input heat flux. The high flux
from solar radiation or electric furnaces can be used to heat the exterior
wall of reactors, a two-cavity receiver, or heat transfer fluid. The reac-
tive  particle  bed  will  be  heated  indirectly  in  various  means  from  the
absorber to the particles; however, the maximum temperature of the bed
is limited by complex reactor design, materials applied, and multi-step
heat transfer processes [4].

The performance of the TCES system can be affected by the reactor
scale and design [47], power system integration [54], corrosion of metal
components, degraded reversibility of reaction due to the agglomeration
of  solid  particles,  and  additional  heat  required  to  reach  the  high  dis-
charging reaction temperature [25]. A typical particle-based CSP TCES
system consists of solar collector and receiver, reduction/oxidation re-
actors, particle lift and conveyor, storage bin, and heat exchangers [55,
56]. Among these components, the reduction and oxidation (redox) re-
actors hold the key to maximize the utilization of storage materials and
energy conversion efficiencies. An ideal design of reactors can promote
heat and mass transfer, accelerate the reaction rate, minimize reactor
volume, and optimize the operational conditions. However, there is a
lack  of  detailed  knowledge  about  the  reactors  design,  operation,
scale-up,  and  power  system  integration  for  TCES  systems,  hence  a

comprehensive  understanding  and  review  of  the  TCES  reactor  design
and optimization is urgently needed.

The objective of the present study is to thoroughly and comprehen-
sively examine the state-of-the-art research and development of particle-
bed  chemical  reactors  for  TCES  applications.  It  should  be  noted  that
there exist a few review articles about TCES with different focuses, e.g.,
on  materials  screening  [9],  reversible  reactions  [57],  general  TCES
systems [30], CSP-based reactors and materials [14], and H2O and/or
CO2 splitting [48]. However, a thorough review of particle-based TCES
reactors design, development, characterization, and evaluation, as well
as reactor scale-up and system integration, which are crucial to devel-
oping TECS technologies that are technically achievable, economically
sustainable, and practically feasible, is still lacking. Therefore, we start
with the fundamentals of TCES in terms of reactive materials, reactions,
thermodynamics,  chemical  kinetics,  and  transport  phenomena,  out-
lining the general criteria of material screening and reactor design. We
then  reviewed  the  state-of-the-art  of  particle-based  TCES  reactors,
including fixed, moving, rotary, fluidized, and entrained bed reactors.
These five types of reactors are comprehensively compared to identify
their respective pros and cons, which provides valuable insights into the
next-generation reactor designs. Additionally, we scrutinized the char-
acterization and assessment criteria of TCES reactors, in terms of per-
formance, cost, and durability evaluation. Discrepancies in definitions
and evaluation criteria have been identified, and recommendations have
been made. We also reviewed and summarized the main challenges for
reactor  scale-up  design  and  power  system  integration,  which  are
essential  for  TCES  commercialization.  Finally,  we  discussed  the
remaining challenges for particle-based TCES reactors development and
proposed  future  research  opportunities  for  next-generation  TCES  re-
actors development and demonstration.

2. TCES fundamentals

2.1. Material and reaction

The particle-based materials that can be used for high-temperature
TCES  applications  can  be  classified  as  salt  hydrates,  metal  chloride
ammoniate,  metal  hydrides,  metal  hydroxides,  metal  carbonates,  and
metal oxides, as shown in Fig. 6, where some representative examples
for each category are provided.

Salt hydrates, sometimes classified as latent heat storage materials,
can be dehydrated when absorbing heat and releasing water typically at
the  temperature  of  100–200
C,  while  when  energy  is  needed,
exothermic  hydration  reaction  will  be  utilized  to  release  heat  [58].
Metal chloride ammoniate, such as CaCl2⋅8NH3 and MnCl2⋅6NH3, can be
used  to  absorb  and  store  heat  through  endothermic  de-ammoniation
reactions  (25–160
C),  and  the  stored  heat  can  be  discharged  via
exothermic ammoniation reactions. Metal hydrides (e.g., MgH2 and LiH)
can  be  used  to  store  energy  over  a  wide  range  of  temperatures
(150–1400
C);  however,  the  unstable  reaction  products,  e.g.,  pure
metals  and  hydrogen  gases,  require  complex  storage  systems,  even
(cid:0) 1.  In
though  the  energy  density  can  be  as  high  as  1100–4400  kJ  kg
addition, the slow reaction kinetics and high material cost are also the
obstacles  to  practical  applications  [59].  Metal  hydroxides  (e.g.,  Mg
(OH)2 and Ca(OH)2) absorb a large amount of heat during dehydration
reactions at about 150–420
C with the gravimetric energy density of
(cid:0) 1. This type of materials is usually less toxic, abun-
1200–1400 kJ kg
dant,  and  cost  effective;  however,  the  management  of  cyclic  powder
properties  and  steam  generation  and  storage  are  among  the  biggest
challenges for large scale applications. The decomposition of carbonates
◦
at elevated temperature (e.g., 850–900
C for CaCO3 [60–62] and up to
C  for  SrCO3  [63])  can  transfer  thermal  heat  into  rearranged
1235
chemical bonds, generating CO2. The energy density can be as high as
(cid:0) 1 for CaCO3/CaO cycling with low cost due to the abundance
1500 kJ kg
(cid:0) 3 for SrCO3/SrO cycling [63]. CO2
of materials [32], or up to 1.5 GJ m
storage is needed to complete the charge and discharge cycles, and the

inhibit

sintering and agglomeration of solid particles remain the challenges for
practical  applications.  Metal  oxides  (e.g.,  BaO2  and  Co3O4)  can  be
◦
decomposed over 700
C and release oxygen gases. Since O2 is abundant
in the air, the system complexity can be reduced because no separate
storage of O2 is needed. Air can serve as both reactants and heat transfer
media during discharging processes [64]. Recently, mixed metal oxides
have been actively investigated to improve the performance of a pure
metal oxide. Mixed metal oxides were reported to improve the proper-
ties of TCES materials in many aspects [9]. For instance, mixed metal
oxides  can
the  sintering  of  reactive  materials  (e.g.,
yttria-stabilized zirconia inhibited the sintering of CuO and SrO particles
[63,65]), improve flowability (e.g., Al2O3  nanoparticles improved the
gravity-driven flow of Ca(OH)2  particles [66]), accelerate chemical re-
action  and  lower  reaction  temperature  (e.g.,  CuO,  MnO2,  or  Fe2O3
reduced the reduction temperature of BaO2 by almost 500
C [67,68]),
and  improve  cyclic  stability  (e.g.,  adding  10–20  wt%  Fe2O3  or  Al2O3
improved the structure stability of Co3O4 materials [69], and Mg–Mn–O
particles with 1:1 Mg to Mn molar ratio exhibited micropore opening
and  excellent  redox  cyclability  between  1000
C  [28]).
Unfortunately, there  still lacks a  comprehensive understanding of the
reaction  mechanisms  and  reaction  kinetics  for  the  reduction  and
oxidation of mixed metal oxides. Some promising examples of reversible
gas-solid reactions for thermochemical energy storage are presented in
Table 1.

storage  capacity,  reaction  reversibility,  reaction  kinetics,  reaction
product  separation and  storage,  flowability,  and  economic  factors  [9,
70]:

(1)  Reaction  temperature:  The  temperature  of  charge  reaction  is
determined by the nature of the reactive materials, reaction condi-
tions, and the heating methods, while the discharge reaction tem-
perature is also limited by the coupled power block.
(2) Energy storage capacity: The heat of reaction per unit of volume
or  mass  of  TCES  materials  determines  the  amount  of  material
required  for  a  certain  energy  demand,  requiring  different  sizes  of
reactors and storage containers.
(3)  Reaction  reversibility:  The  reversibility  of  the  forward  and
backward reactions impacts the charge-discharge cycling behaviors.

In  gas-solid  reactions,  a  poor  reversibility  will  lead  to  incomplete
reactions with deteriorated thermal energy absorption and release.
(4)  Reaction  kinetics:  Gas-solid  reaction  kinetics  are  often  experi-
mentally determined by thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) and dif-
ferential  scanning  calorimetry  (DSC),  allowing  the  design  of  cycle
duration and prediction of reaction extent as well as heat storage and
release.
(5) Reaction product separation and storage: To facilitate the gas-
solid  reaction  toward  the  desired  direction,  the  gaseous  products
have to be removed and separated from solid particles immediately,
while the solid products (i.e., the charged or discharged particles)
should be stored properly. The storage environment is subject to the
nature of materials.

(6) Flowability: The flowability of the solid particles is particularly
important for moving- and fluidized-bed reactors. Most TCES appli-
cations  involve  high  temperature  operations,  under  which  solid
particles tend to agglomerate and choke in the reactors. This would
prevent the continuous operation of the TCES systems.
(7)  Economic  viability:  The  abundance  and  low  cost  of  the  TCES
materials  are  of  particular  importance  when  they  are  applied  for
large-scale TCES systems.
(8)  Other  factors:  The  corrosivity,  toxicity,  flammability,  and  gas
storage requirement should also be considered when screening the
TCES materials.

2.2. Thermodynamics

Thermodynamic  analysis  is  a  critical  method  to  understand  the
theoretical  performance of  the  reactive  material  in  an  idealized envi-
ronment.  Thermodynamic  analysis  involves  the  calculation  of  energy
and  exergy  changes  of  associated  reactions,  including  changes  in
enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy (ΔG). The analysis can not only
assess the feasibility of a chemical reaction at given temperature and
pressure (e.g., spontaneous when ΔG < 0 and non-spontaneous when
ΔG > 0), but also determine how much heat can be stored in or released
from  chemical  bonds  (e.g.,  evaluation  via  enthalpy  change  ΔH).
Therefore,  the  suitable  reaction,  proper  reactants,  effect  of  different
operating conditions, and theoretical energy conversion efficiency can
be determined via the thermodynamic analysis of chemical reactions.

Thermodynamic feasibility of a redox reaction can be demonstrated
in an Ellingham plot, which is a plot of Gibbs free energy changes (ΔG)
as a function of temperature. As shown in Fig. 7, the promising redox
material  pairs,  such  as  BaO2/BaO,  Mn2O3/Mn3O4,  Co3O4/CoO,  CuO/
Cu2O, and Fe2O3/Fe3O4 are presented, and it is shown that the transition
temperature for Fe2O3/Fe3O4  can be as high as 1350
C, followed by
◦
CuO/Cu2O (1125
C) and Co3O4/CoO, Mn2O3/Mn3O4, as well as BaO2/
BaO (less than 1000

C) in air.

Manganese oxides (MnOx) are commonly used in TCES applications
due  to  its  multivalent  nature  and  abundance  in  the  Earth’s  crust.  As
temperature increases, the manganese oxides transition from MnO2, to
Mn2O3,  Mn3O4,  and  MnO  under  different  oxygen  partial  pressure  as
shown  in  Fig.  8.  The  MnO2/Mn2O3  redox  reaction  exhibits  poor
reversibility and is thus unfavorable to TCES cycles, while the transition
from  Mn2O3  to  Mn3O4  or  MnO  is  extensively  used  for  TCES  systems.
However, thermodynamic analysis does not provide information about

chemical  energy  storage  based  on  thermodynamic  simulations  using  HSC

cal Society.).

the reaction mechanisms, reaction rates, and heat storage or release rate,
where the knowledge of chemical kinetics is needed.

2.3. Chemical kinetics

Chemical kinetics analysis is the method to investigate how reactants
react to form products, how fast a chemical reaction proceeds, and how
fast heat is stored or released in a chemical reaction. The chemical ki-
netics  in  a  TCES  reaction  are  often  determined  by  thermogravimetry
analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), which are
important to understand the dynamics characteristics of a TCES reactor
[82,84]. Even though reaction kinetics have been widely investigated
for TCES materials, few extensive kinetics models can be found in the
literature and discrepancies exist in various studies [86]. The tempera-
ture,  pressure,  and  degree  of  conversion  are  three  major  operational
parameters that affect the performance of TCES materials and reactors,
and the rate of chemical reaction can be calculated as follows,

where α is the degree of conversion of chemical reactants, t is time in [s],
k is the rate coefficient, f describes the reaction mechanisms, and h ac-
counts for the pressure dependence of reactants. The rate coefficient, k,
is  a  function  of  temperature,  T  in  [K],  and  is  often  calculated  via
Arrhenius equation [86,87],

k(T) = A exp

where  A  is  the  pre-exponential  factor,  which  may  be  a  constant  or  a

(cid:0) 1]  that  can  be
constant,  and  Ea  is  the  activation  energy  in  [kJ⋅mol
indirectly measured by TGA analysis. The function f(α) determined by
the types of reaction mechanisms is presented in Table 2. Detailed cal-
culations  to  determine  A  and  Ea  can  be  found  elsewhere  such  as  in
Ref. [72].

where n is a constant coefficient based on different types of reactants and

the forward and backward reactions are proceeded at the same rate.

A good example of kinetics characterization can be illustrated by the
case of manganese oxides. Botas et al. [89] investigated the chemical
kinetics  of  the  thermal  reduction  of  Mn2O3  reactions  using  the  ther-
mogravimetric device as shown in Fig. 9a. The mass change of Mn2O3

pre-exponential factor,  A, and reaction mechanism, f(α) are the three
essential  components  to  quantitively  determine  the  reaction  kinetics,
which  are  known  as  kinetic  triplet.  However,  discrepancy  exists  in
various experimental studies, and the use of experimental data on re-
action kinetics should be carefully conducted [33].

2.4. Transport phenomena

Thermodynamics and chemical kinetics play a vital role in providing
insights  into  the  performance of  reactors  when  operating  under  ideal
conditions.  However,  the  actual  performance  of  reactors  is  subject  to

complex transport phenomena, including the conservation and transport
of mass, species, energy, and momentum [87,97]. In a practical reaction
system, the dynamics of these transport processes significantly influence
the  efficiency,  stability,  reliability,  and  durability  of  the  reactors.
Therefore, a comprehensive and thorough understanding of the trans-
port phenomena within the reactors is needed.

Mass conservation is enforced within the reactors for specific phases
and  species,  and  the  mass  may  increase  or  decrease  due  to  chemical
reactions or phase changes. The transport of mass and species can be
governed  by  convection  and  diffusion,  and  the  gas-solid  interactions
remain the  challenges for  model development [98].  For fixed bed  re-
actors, the solid reactants can be assumed to be stationary, while the
gaseous reactants pass through the void region resulting from packed
particles.  Diffusion  (governed  by  the  Fick’s  law  of  diffusion)  and
permeation (governed by the Darcy’s law) can be utilized to characterize
the transport losses in the packed bed, while in a moving bed reactor
(usually  gravity-assisted),  the  gas-solid  interaction  is  becoming  more
complex depending on the movement of solid particles. When the gas
and solid velocity is further increased, the mass transfer can be enhanced
by various flow patterns, such as smooth, bubbling, turbulent, and fast
fluidization. The fluidization pattern is determined by a number of pa-
rameters  including  the  gas  velocity,  particle  size  and  particle  density
[99,100].

The  energy  balance  within  the  high-temperature  reactors  necessi-
tates  considering  of  the  convection,  conduction,  radiation,  and  heat
generation or absorption by reactions and phase changes. These coupled
transfer  phenomena
involve  complex  gas-solid,  particle-particle,
particle-wall,  and  reactor-environment  interactions.  Crucial  to  under-
standing  these  interactions  are  effective  transport  properties,  such  as
effective  volumetric  heat  transfer  coefficient,  effective  thermal  con-
ductivity, absorption coefficient, and the rate of reaction heat genera-
tion  or  absorption.  The  integration  of  these  effective  parameters  into
mathematical models is vital to capture the high-temperature thermal
behavior of the reactors, facilitating the design and optimization of high-
efficiency  reactors.  Unfortunately,  there  remains  a  knowledge  gap  in
literature to understand the effective transport properties  of the solid
particles  as  well  as  the  gas-particle-wall  interactions  in  a  reacting
system.

The mathematical description of momentum transport for gas-solid
reacting  systems  represents  one  of  the  biggest  challenges  for  reactor
modeling. The momentum of gas phases in the fixed and moving bed
reactors  is  often  described  by  the incompressible  Navier-Stokes  equa-
tions  in  porous  media  with  effective  transport  properties,  including

viscosity,  effective  diffusivity,  and  permeability.  These  properties
depend  on  the  solid  and  gas  materials,  particle  and  pore  structure,
density and composition of the gas phases, temperature, and pressures.
In  fluidized  bed  reactors,  the  movement  of  solid  particles  can  be
assumed fluidlike. In a dilute fluidized region, particles can be assumed
to be perfectly entrained in a gas flow when the particle Stokes number
(St) is smaller than 1, and the particles do not need to be traced during
modeling. When the St is large enough, the gas-solid interactions need to
be considered. For very dense fluidized beds, particle-particle interac-
tion  should  be  considered  in  addition  to  the  particle-gas  interaction,
which made the modeling even more challenging. Considering the dif-
ficulties in experimental observation of the fluidized bed, various nu-
merical  simulations  have  been  employed,  e.g.,  direct  numerical
simulation  (DNS),  computational  fluid  dynamics-discrete  element
method (CFD-DEM), computational particle fluid dynamics (CPFD) and
two  fluids  model  (TFM)  [101]  (Fig.  10).  DNS  models  distinguish  be-
tween solid and gas phases, addressing gas-solid interactions by directly
solving  the  Navier-Stokes  (N–S)  equations  without  relying  on  model
assumptions.
including
Lagrangian-Eulerian,  Immersed  Boundary,  and  Lattice  Boltzmann
methods, have been developed for DNS. While DNS is advantageous in
capturing microscopic details in solid and gas flows, it can be extremely
computationally  expensive,  particularly  when  dealing  with  a  large
number  of  particles.  In  contrast,  CFD-DEM  models  leverage  the
computational  efficiency  of  the  DEM  method,  treating  particles  as  a

discrete phase and employing Newton’s second law to track their mo-
tion. The gas phase is treated as continuous, with N–S equations being
solved. Interactions between solid and fluid phases are characterized by
effective  interphase  properties,  and  solid-solid  interactions  follow
collision  models,  such  as  soft  sphere  model,  hard  sphere  model,  and
direct simulation Monte Carlo method. CFD-DEM, faster than DNS, is
commonly  applied  to  gas-solid  mixtures  involving  fewer  than  one
million  particles.  Despite  its  enhanced  speed,  the  resolution  of
inter-particle  collisions is  the major  limitation  to further improve  the
computation  efficiency.  For  accelerated  computational  speed,  CPFD
assumes  solid  particles  as  a  discrete  phase,  employing  a  multiphase
particle-in-cell (MP-PIC) approach to solve particle flow. The interaction
between  solid  and  gas  phases  is  based  on  the  drag  force  theory,  and
particle collisions are modeled using solid phase stress, ensuring high
computing  speed.  In  the  TFM  method,  solid  and  gas  are  treated  as
continuous  phases  that  can  interpenetrate.  All  solid  particles  are
assumed to be identical, and a highly resolved two-fluid model achieves
substantial agreement with the DNS model without requiring the con-
tinuum  assumption  of  solid  particles,  which  is  currently  the  most
well-established numerical methods for gas-solid flow. Detailed discus-
sions on the formulation, assumptions, and justifications of these models
have  been  well  articulated  elsewhere  and  are  not covered  here  [101,
102].

Particle-scale  modeling  to  resolve  particle  bed  flow  can  provide
valuable  insights  into  the  local  particle-particle  and  particle-wall

interactions  which  can  significantly  affect  the  flowability  and  heat
transfer in the particle bed [103,104], although many models assume a
solid  continuum  for  the  particle  bed  instead  of  resolving  the  actual
granular flow [96,105]. Chilamkurti and Gould [103,104,106] experi-
mentally  and  numerically  (via  DEM  methods)  studied  dense
gravity-driven granular flows in cylindrical hoppers and tubes to char-
acterize the effects of flow parameters (i.e., tube radius, tube inclination,
tube  length,  and  exit  diameter)  on  the  velocity  and  packing  fraction
profiles  in  two  distinct domains  –  bulk region  and  near-wall domain.
Near-wall  packing  fraction,  particle  residence  time,  and  velocity
decreased  with  an  increase  in  particle  bed  flow  velocity  due  to
particle-wall frictional interactions. Yarrington et al. [107] and Bage-
palli  et  al.  [108]  experimentally  determined  temperature-dependent
granular  flow  properties  of  Carbobead  CP  particles,  including  elastic
and  shear  moduli,  particle-particle  sliding  and  rolling  friction

coefficient,  and  particle-particle  restitution  coefficient.  There  flow
properties were used to study granular flow on an inclined plane. The
◦
high temperature at 800
C was observed to cause a 37.9 % decrease in
the steady-state mass flow rate and a 53 % increase in the time to reach
steady state. Grobbel et al. [109] also experimentally and numerically
determined  the  granular  flow  parameters  for  bauxite  particles  and
analyzed the influence of coarse-graining on the said parameters.

A  heat  transfer  model  for  dense  granular  flows  using  resistance
networks and effective near-wall thermal conductivity correlations was
developed by Watkins et al. [108] based on the packing fractions and
particle-wall residence times obtained in Ref. [104]. The effect of radi-
ation  was  included,  and  the  correlation  was  validated.  Heat  transfer
behaviors in gravity-driven granular flows have been studied via DEM
methods  for  a  shell-and-tube  moving  packed-bed  heat  exchanger
(MPBHX). The effects of the type of tubes (e.g., circular and elliptical),

tube  oscillation,  and  particle  bed  velocity  on  the  heat  transfer  co-
efficients  have  been  investigated  [110,111].  Johnson  et  al.  [112]
developed  an  open-source  DEM  model  including  conduction,  convec-
tion, and radiation. The shell-and-plate MPBHX model and Monte Carlo
ray  tracing  analysis  for  radiation  were  validated;  however,  the  inter-
stitial  fluids  were  not  considered.  Kuruneru  et  al.  [113]  developed  a
CFD-DEM model for an MPBHX taking into account thermal radiation
and temperature-dependent fluid properties. Temperature and packing
fraction  effects  were  studied  in  the  near-wall  and  bulk  regions  for
fixed-bed and MPBHXs. Lower temperature and packing fraction were
observed in the near wall region compared to the bulk region. It should
be  noted  that  although  CFD-DEM  models  have  been  employed  for
modeling heat transfer, fluid flow, and granular flow in MPBHXs, the
application  of  CFD-DEM  methods  for  reactive  particle  beds  is  still
limited.

While  the  detailed  resolution  of  particle-particle  and  particle-gas
interactions at a discrete level (DNS, CFD-DEM, etc.) is preferred, the
computational cost of such simulations is very high, limiting the simu-
lations  to  short  timescales.  For  this  reason,  a  substantial  amount  of
literature has been dedicated to the development of “continuum-scale”
models.  These  models  assume  both  gas  and  particle  phases  to  be  ho-
mogenous (continua) within the computational cell [102]. By treating
the reaction system at a macroscopic scale, these continuum models are
more  computationally  efficient,  enabling  the  simulation  of  longer
timescales and large spatial domains. Even though such models involve
corresponding  simplifications  and  assumptions,  the  trade-off  between
computational  efficiency  and  modeling  the  essential  gas-solid  in-
teractions can be balanced, make such models valuable tools to under-
stand the reactive flows in TCES systems.

When the particle phase is stationary, only the gas-phase flow needs

to be resolved for momentum equations. A transient continuum heat and
mass transfer  model (1D)  for a  packed-bed reactor  was developed  by
Str ̈ohle et al. [114]. Detailed model validation was performed against
both  a  classic  transient  sensible-only  storage  experiment  [115]  and
experimental results for the de-hydration of Ca(OH)2 by Schaube et al.
[116]. A recent work by Wang et al. [83] studied the thermal reduction
of iron-manganese in a tubular packed bed with a neighboring reflective
cavity. Their work demonstrated good agreement with transient mea-
surements of temperature and oxygen concentration for a corresponding
experimental setup. Hamidi et al. [117] studied a similar tubular reactor
for  iron-manganese  particles,  however,  their  model  did  not  consider
radiation through a cavity/receiver.

When the particle phase is moving, the effect of particle flow on the
gas-phase flow should be considered. Preisner et al. [96] presented a 1D
dual-phase  model  to  simulate  a  moving-bed  concept.  Validation  was
performed against experimental datasets developed by the same group
for  a  lab-scale  packed-bed  reactor  [64,82].  A  1D  extension  of  this
approach  for  a  Mg–Mn–O  based  reactor  was  demonstrated  by  Huang
et al. [105]. A follow-up 2D model by Korba et al. [23] was also pre-
sented, demonstrating improved prediction of oxygen concentration and
temperatures in a corresponding reduction reactor experimental setup
[28]. Furthermore, a 3D model was also developed by Korba et al. [118]
to  simulate  a  moving-bed  oxidation  reactor  to  demonstrate  sustained
high-temperature (>1000
C) heat extraction due to exothermic reac-
tion of Mg–Mn–O particles. A model for a tilt-bed reduction reactor was
developed by Schrader et al. [119,120]. The details of the TCES model
and  reactor  design  were  presented  in  Ref.  [119]  and  the  subsequent
experimental results were provided in Ref. [120]. Overall, these models
are able to simulate TCES reactors with spatiotemporal scales matching
those of realistic (lab/full-scale) designs. Nonetheless, there are several

◦

remaining  challenges  for  future  model  development:  (1)  developing
particle-wall heat transfer coefficient correlations for high-temperature
reactors,  (2)  measuring  specific  up-scaling  quantities  (e.g.,  Darcy
permeability, Forchheimer coefficients, effective bed conductivity, and
effective diffusivity), and (3) resolving particle-particle and particle-gas
interactions (e.g., interphase drag coefficients, interphase heat transfer,
and effective surface area).

Many customized codes and commercial software are developed and
employed to model TCES systems, taking into account complex chemical
kinetics and transport phenomena in different reactor geometries, and a
brief summary of various TCES models is presented in Table S1 of the
Supplementary Material.

3. TCES reactor classification and development

3.1. Types of reactors

The TCES reactors can be classified according to different criteria in
literature, e.g., phases of materials, operating modes, and heat transfer
modes [25]. Based on different phases of TCES materials, the reactors
can be classified as single- and multi-phase categories. In a single-phase
reactor, only one visible phase exists (either gas or liquid) during the
operation. In a multi-phase reactor, two or more different phases or two
immiscible liquid phases (e.g., liquid-gas, solid-liquid, solid-gas, solid--
liquid-gas, and liquid-liquid) are involved. The present review focuses
on solid particle based TCES reactors in the literature. Based on different
operating  modes,  the  reactors  can  be  categorized  as  continuous,
semi-batch,  and  batch  modes.  Continuous  reactors  are  designed  for
steady-state operation, and batch reactors are designed for non-steady
reactors  [25].  Based  on  the  heat  transfer  modes,  the  reactors  can  be
isothermal and adiabatic. The heat transfer capability is crucial to the
particle conversion efficiency, charging and discharging rates, reactor
power level, and thermal efficiency.

Based on the particle flow patterns, the reactors can be classified as
stacked,  fluidized,  and  entrained  bed  types  [121,122],  in  which  the
stacked bed reactors can be further categorized as fixed, moving, and
rotary bed reactors, as shown in Fig. 11.

3.1.1. Fixed bed reactors

The fixed bed reactors (i.e., packed bed or integral reactors) provide
a stationary vessel for the solid particles with gaseous reactants flowing
through during the charging and discharging reactions [123]. The en-
ergy storage capacity of this type of reactor is almost proportional to the
volume of the reactors, and it is challenging to scale up the reactors (e.g.,
~ MW). In addition, when the size of reactors is large, the performance
of reactors is also restricted by the heat transfer rate and temperature
uniformity within the reaction bed. Hot spots or temperature gradient
may  affect  the  selectivity,  rate,  and  extent  of  TCES  reactions.  It  was
recommended  to  enhance  the  heat  transfer  and  increase  the  active
surface  area  by  stirring  particles  [25].  Fixed  bed  reactors  have  been
reported  for  almost  all  types  of  TCES  reactive  materials  over  a  wide
range of operating temperatures from 400 to 2000

C.

Metal  hydroxides,  with  typical  low  charge  and  discharge  reaction
temperatures, have been widely tested in fixed bed reactors. Roßkopf
et al. [124] designed and built a lab-scale cylindrical packed bed reactor
with the diameter of 54.5 mm and height of 158 mm to store thermal
energy from industrial waste heat or CSP through Ca(OH)2/CaO reac-
tion  systems  at  the  temperature  of  400–600
C.  During  the  charging
process,  a  nitrogen  flow  was  preheated  to  600
C  and  subsequently
mixed with water vapor from a steam generator. During the discharging
◦
C without flowing gas
process, the reactor was firstly preheated to 300
mixture.  When  the  temperature,  pressure,  and  vapor  concentration
reached the design points, the inlet valve of the reactor was opened to
enable the reactions. It is reported that the white hydrated lime Ca(OH)2
(cid:0) 3 with the purity of
particles (~5 μm) held a bulk density of ~450 kg m
97.8 %. 2 wt% of SiO2 nanoparticles were added to the reactive particles
to stabilize the particle structure, reduce charging and discharging time,
and improve cycling stability. Schmidt et al. [125] developed a 10 kW
heat  exchanger-like  fixed  bed  reactor  at  German  Aerospace  Center
(DLR)  for  TCES  based  on  Ca(OH)2/CaO  reactions.  The  test  bench
included  four  major  subsystems  -  a  heat  transfer  fluid  (HTF)  supply
subsystem, a reaction gas supply subsystem, a reactor subsystem, and a
cooling subsystem. In the HTF unit, the air was compressed up to 10 bar,
and the flow was regulated by two mass flow controllers in parallel and
preheated up to 700
C in electric heaters. In the reaction gas supply
unit,  a  thermostatic  bath  was  used  to  control  the  temperature  of  the
distilled water via a tube bundle heat exchanger. The outlet temperature

Pure  metal  oxides,  with  a  typically  high  operating  temperature
◦
around 1000
C, were also widely tested in fixed bed reactors. Gigantino
et  al.  [65]  developed  a  thermochemical  reactor  based  on  CuO/Cu2O
pairs. The reactor was composed of a 5 mm thick fused-quartz tube, as
shown in Fig. 12. At the bottom of the reactor, a quartz wool and sin-
tered quartz disc were placed at the bottom of the reactor to support the
dark  reactive  CuO-based  granules.  About  50  wt%  yttria  (Y2O3)-stabi-
lized zirconia (ZrO2) (YSZ) was mixed in CuO as inhibitor to the sin-
tering of reactive particles. On top of the dark CuO-YSZ bed, an inert
fixed bed of 5 mol % Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 beads was used to minimize
radiation  losses  and  to avoid  fluidization.  The granules  demonstrated
almost complete redox conversions for more than 100 charge-discharge

cycles in the temperature range of 920–1120
C. The gravimetric energy

Mixed  oxides  can  benefit  the  reactor  design  in  various  ways,  e.g.,
stabilizing the particle structure, catalyzing reaction rates, and lowering
reduction  and  oxidation  temperatures.  Wang  et  al.  [83]  developed  a
10.6  kW  fixed-bed  thermochemical  reactor  based  on  iron-manganese

ratio  of  2:1,
(Mn0.33Fe0.67)2O3).  As  shown  in  Fig.  13,  the  fixed-bed  reactor  is
composed of a reaction tube made of silicon carbide (SiC), a cylindrical
cavity, a compound parabolic concentrator (CPC), a ZAL-15 insulation
layer, an MICROSIL insulation layer, and a stainless-steel mantle. The
reactive Fe67 particles (diameter dp = 1 mm) are packed in the middle of
the  reaction  tube  and  supported  on  a  packed  bed  of  non-reactive
alumina (Al2O3) particles (dp  = 3 mm). Argon was swept through the
reaction bed from the bottom when Fe67 was being charged through a
decomposition reaction at an elevated temperature of 627–927
C. The

about  40 %  of the  total  solar  radiation  was  absorbed  by  the reaction
tube. The instantaneous energy efficiency was 25.6 % taking sensible
and chemical energy into consideration, while as high as 9.3 % of the
total energy can be stored in chemical bonds. It should be noted that the
efficiency reported is based on the instantaneous peak performance, and

◦

the average or steady-state performance should be further verified.

Fixed bed reactors are relatively easy to construct, simple to control,
suitable  for  small  scale  tests, and  free  of  moving  particles,  which  are
commonly used to test and demonstrate new TCES reactive materials.
However, since particles are stationary, it is challenging to charge solid
particles in the fixed bed reactors uniformly and continuously. There-
fore,  the  energy  storage  capacity  is  limited  by  the  total  amount  of
reactive materials and reactor size. To promote the commercialization of
novel TCES concepts for large-scale applications, other types of reactors
that can be operated continuously have been explored, such as moving-,
rotary-, fluidized-, and entrained-bed reactors.

3.1.2. Moving bed reactors

Unlike  many  packed-bed  reactors  using  the  same  reactor  for  both
charging and discharging by switching the gas streams, the moving bed
reactors utilize a removable bed in which the particles can be removed
continuously or intermittently when immersed in an inert gas environ-
ment for thermal reduction or when reacting with gaseous reactants for
oxidation. In comparison with packed-bed reactors, moving bed reactors
can facilitate continuous reactions with enhanced heat transfer, flexible
operating  conditions,  and  improved  reactor  efficiency.  Therefore,
moving  bed  reactors  can  continuously  charge  solid  particles,  and  the
energy  storage  capacity  is  independent  of  the  reactor  sized  and  only
limited  by  the  availability  of  reactive  materials  and  storage  volume.
Potential  reactor  instability,  particle  attrition,  and  complex  operating
strategies are remaining challenges to scale-up this type of reactors.

An  indirectly  heated  moving  bed  reactor  based  on  Ca(OH)2/CaO
materials was developed by Schmidt et al. [66]. It was reported that Ca
(OH)2  particles are very cohesive and difficult for gravity-driven flow.
About 12 wt% Al2O3  nanoparticles were mixed with 270 kg Ca(OH)2
powder  for  reduced  flow  resistance  and  good  conversion  efficiency
(~78 %). The energy storage materials flow through 158 tubes with an
inner diameter of 28 mm, which are installed in the tube bundle heat
exchanger. On the shell side, the air and particles were transported in a
counter-current  direction  against  the  tubes,  generating  about  10  kW
thermal power.

Mixed metal oxide particles with better flowability are favorable in
moving bed reactors. Randhir et al. [28] and Hayes et al. [126] designed
and tested a reduction reactor and an oxidation reactor, respectively, for
a  magnesium-manganese-oxide  (Mg–Mn–O)  based  moving-bed  TCES
system  as  shown  in  Fig.  14.  In  both  reactors,  the  primary  vertical
ceramic tubes were filled with solid particles and additional pellets were
fed from top hoppers when the bed started to move slowly along the tube

reactors  under  gravity  –  a  non-mechanical  pulse-width  modulated
L-valve  flow  controller  that  minimizes  particle  attrition  and  abrasion
was also implemented in each reactor. A counter-flow gas stream (inert
gas for the reduction reactor and air for the oxidation reactor) was fed
from the bottom of reactor for driving the reaction as well as for sensible
heat recovery with mass flow rates matching   ̇msCp,s =  ̇mgCp,g  . With such
a scheme, the high-temperature reaction zone was confined in the center
along the axial direction, and recuperation and quenching zones were
also realized (see Fig. 15) to enable “cold-in and cold-out” for particles,
which  makes  the  sealing  very  convenient.  The  Mg–Mn–O  particles
demonstrated  excellent  flowability  up  to  1450
C  in  the  reduction
reactor with the extent of reduction reaction measured to be over 90 %
of the fully reduced state at equilibrium for selected sample pellets; and
the thermal-to-chemical efficiency and overall system efficiency (96 %
and  35  %  respectively)  are  among  the  highest  reported  for  thermo-
chemical fuels [28]. For the oxidation reactor, steady operation was also
achieved,  showing  reactor  temperatures  in  excess  of  1000
C  and
◦
extraction temperatures above 950
C [126]. Continuum heat and mass
transfer  models  have  also  been  developed  to  simulate  the  transient
processes  and  steady-state  operation  in  both  reduction  and  oxidation
reactors [105,118]; some representative simulation results for both re-
actors at steady state are shown in Fig. 15 (c, d). After validation, those
models  are  extremely  valuable  for  high-temperature  TCES  reactor
design and operating parameters selection.

A  5  kW  inclined  moving  bed  reactor  based  on  aluminum-doped

calcium  manganite  CaAl0.2Mn0.8O3  (namely  CAM28)  granular  pow-
ders (average dp = 45 μm) was developed by Schrader et al. [119,120].
As  shown  in  Fig.  16,  concentrated  irradiation  is  supplied  by  a  solar
simulator and enters a rectangular cavity (0.15 × 0.15 × 0.1 m3) made
of aluminosilicate boards. The interior surface of the cavity is coated by
reflective  and  high-purity  alumina.  The  particles  were  fed  into  the
hopper with the flow rate controlled by an orifice plate and a solenoid
valve.  Argon  gas  was  supplied  to  the  cavity  assisted  by  gravity,  the
particles flew along an inclined plane within the insulated cavity, which
was  exposed  to  solar  radiation.  The  designed  cavity  demonstrated
continuous operation with the bed temperature of over 800
C, and as
high as 64.7 % of the solar radiation was stored in sensible and chemical
energy. Schrader et al. [119] further developed a heat and mass transfer
model  based  on  ANSYS  Fluent  to  investigate  the  effects  of  inclined
granular flows of solid particles on the reactor performance. The radi-
ative energy exchange between solar simulator and the interior reactor
surfaces  were  modeled  based  on  the  methods  of  (i)  Monte  Carlo  ray
tracing for the directional solar intensities, (ii) finite volume for radia-
tive  governing  equations,  and  (iii)  Rosseland  diffusion  to  resolve
particle-particle interactions. A sensitivity study was performed for the
(cid:0) 1,
operating  conditions  of  solid  mass  flow  rates  of  230–300  g  min
radiative power of 4.3–5.2 kW, and inclination angle of 31–35
. It was
found  that  the  flow  velocity,  solar  power,  radiative  properties,  and
specific heat are among the four most sensitive parameters that impact
the reactor performance.

particles are fed from the top of the reactors, while inert or reactant gas
is  supplied  from  the  bottom.  Unlike  fixed  bed  reactors,  the  energy
storage capacity is theoretically unlimited as long as the reactive par-
ticles can be continuously supplied into and removed from the reaction
chambers. The operating conditions, such as residence time, flow rates,
and  pressure,  may  be  flexible,  while  they  should  be  optimized  for
desired reaction conversion.

3.1.3. Rotary bed reactors

Rotary  reactors  or  rotary  kilns  utilize  cylindrical  vessels  that  can
rotate slowly about their axes, which are often inclined slightly (about
2–10
) from the horizontal, to move reactive particles continuously in a
high-temperature  environment  [127–129].  The  solid  fraction  in  the

◦

reactor  is  generally  small  (e.g.,  10  %),  and  the  insufficient  gas-solid
mixing is often a challenge for reactor design. Adding a partition plate
and multiple guide plates can enhance the gas-solid mixing and move
the particles in desired direction by changing the flow patterns, and the
solid fraction can be increased to 20–40 % with enhanced heat and mass
transfer. When the particles in rotary reactor are directly heated by the
solar radiations, partition and guide plates should be used carefully to
avoid non-uniform heating.

Many  rotary  kiln  prototypes  have  been  developed  to  test  TCES
reactive materials with enhanced mixing capabilities. Alonso et al. [130]
developed a rotary kiln reactor under solar radiation to demonstrate the
TCES based on coper oxides (CuO/Cu2O pair), as shown in Fig. 17. The
cavity was made of ceramic materials and closed by a glass window. The

reactor body was fixed, supported by stainless steel housing, and insu-
lated by a layer of porous alumina. The rotational component was the
cylindrical reaction chamber made of alumina with the inner diameter
of 57.5 mm and length of 74 mm, driven by an engine at the rear of the
reactor. The rotation of reactor improved the reaction rate by mixing the
particles, and nearly 80 % of CuO particles was reduced in argon gas. A
few  redox  cycles  were  also  performed  in  air,  which  disfavoured  the
reduction of CuO in comparison with that in inert argon gas. A further
optimization of the operational variables was suggested for the rotation
speed, gas flow rate, particle size, and initial conditions to improve the
reduction and oxidation conversion of particles.

A  similar  rotary  kiln  reactor  utilizing  direct  solar  irradiation  for
chemical energy storage based on cobalt oxide redox reactions was built
and tested by Neises et al. [81]. The quartz window was installed in front
of the rotary kiln reactor, and the diameter of aperture was 0.08 m. The
admitted solar flux was absorbed by the wall of the rotary kiln and the
reactive particles. The cavity (0.2 m in diameter and 0.5 m in length)
was  fabricated  by  siliconized  silicon  carbide  with  excellent  heat  con-
duction capacity. The cavity was further isolated by ceramic fiber plates
and enclosed in an insulated housing. The entire reactor was rotated by
wheels  at  about  6  rpm,  and  the  rotary  kiln  was  directly  heated  by  a
high-flux  solar  simulator  with  concentrated  radiation  at  22  kW.  The
◦
redox materials were reduced on-sun at 900
C and oxidized off-sun at a
decreased temperature in the same rotary kiln in an air atmosphere. The

rotary kiln reactor can provide a large mass flow rate for solid reaction
materials,  and  a  30-cycle  durability  test  was  performed.  The  experi-
mental  results  showed  no  noticeable  degradation  of  redox  materials
[81]. Tescari et al. [131] further developed a thermal model for a similar
rotary kiln reactor. With the assumptions of equivalent black surface to
simulate  the  reactor  aperture,  the  computing  time  was  shortened  by
almost 50 times without decreasing the solution accuracy. Based on the
steady-state and transient simulation, the insulation thickness over 0.2
m  did  not  yield  significantly  enhanced  heating  up  performance.  The
aperture should be optimized depending on specific operating temper-
◦
C, the optimized aperture diameter was 6 cm. If the
atures, e.g., at 927
operating temperature is lower, the aperture diameter should be larger
to speed up the heating process.

To  enable  continuous  feeding  and  removing  of  reactive  materials
without interruption of operation, screw feeders are often employed in
rotary kilns. Tescari et al. [132] developed a rotary kiln charging reactor
for TCES utilizing manganese-iron oxides (i.e., (Mn0.7Fe0.3)2O3) manu-
factured  in  mm-size  granules,  as  shown  in  Fig.  18a.  The  rotary  kiln
reactor can be operated continuously by heating solid particles at the
rate of about 10 kg h
C, storing
the energy at the rate of 2.1 kW. The particles were fed into and out of an
Inconel cylindrical reactor chamber through a screw feeder and heated
by concentrated radiation (capacity: 20 kW) passing through a window
and an aperture. The rotary kiln was inclined to allow the particles to

flow from the back to the front, where particles can be discharged from
the reactor continuously. The charged particles were further oxidized to
release  heat  in  a  moving  bed  reactor  as  shown  in  Fig.  18b.  In  the
continuous oxidation mode, air is supplied from the bottom of reactor to
◦
oxidize the particles and release heat at the temperature of 300–880
C.
The overall storage efficiency, which is defined as the ratio of the total
stored  sensible  and  chemical  energy  to  the  incident  radiation  energy
from the high-flux solar simulator, can be 23.2–26.2 %, and the con-
version can be around 70 %.

Rotary  bed  reactors  are  often  adopted  to  enhance  heat  transfer;
however,  upscaling  the  rotary  reactors  are  challenging  due  to  the
handling of the rotating chamber, increased parasitic energy consump-
tion,  high  maintenance  effort  and  costs,  and  possible  high  system
complexity  for  large-scale  systems.  It  is  also  observed  that  rotary  re-
actors are mostly employed for charging reactions, and it will be inter-
esting to explore their feasibility in discharging reactors.

3.1.4. Fluidized bed reactors

The fluidized bed reactors utilize high-speed fluid reactants to flow
through and suspend fine solid particles, which behave like a fluid. This
type  of  reactor  offers  excellent  heat  transfer  performance,  can  easily
move solid particles in a fluid-like pattern, and process the particles with
a  wide  range  of  particle  sizes  [133–135].  The  design,  development,
control, and optimization of fluidized bed reactors are more complex in
comparison with stacked bed reactors, and it is challenging to scale up
this  type  of  reactors  as  the  erosion  to  the  bed  and  particle  attrition
should be minimized to avoid high operational cost.

The  fluidization  pattern  is  primarily  affected  by  the  gas  velocity,
particle size and particle density [99]. When the bed is initially packed,
increasing  gas  velocity passing through  motionless solid particles  can
increase the pressure gradient in the packed reaction bed. When the gas
velocity  is  large  enough  to  impose  a  drag  force  on  the  particles  that
overcomes the weight of the particles, the reaction bed becomes fluid-
ized. When the velocity exceeds the minimum fluidization velocity, the
height of the reaction bed is increased, and the fluidization pattern be-
comes  smooth,  bubbling,  turbulent,  and  fast  fluidization  as  velocity
continues to increase. Further increasing the velocity leads to complete
conveying of all particles.

Metal  carbonates  are  among  the  most  used  reactive  materials  in
fluidized  bed  reactors  for  TCES  applications.  Nikulshina  et  al.  [136]
developed a fluidized bed reactor made of quartz tubes to capture CO2
from air through the carbonation of CaO and calcination of CaCO3  by
utilizing  concentrated  solar  energy.  At  the  CaO-carbonation  step,  at-
mospheric air mixed with 500 ppm CO2 and 17 % water vapor is fed into
the reactor for better kinetics at 365–400
C. At the CaCO3-calcination

◦

step, argon gas flows through the reactor at 800–875
C to accelerate
reaction  rate  and  avoid  particle  sintering.  After  five  consecutive
carbonation-calcination  cycles,  the  mass  changes  of  CO2  capture  and
release was about 0.1 %. It was also observed that adding SiO2 particles
reduced CaO particle size with enhanced surface area.

◦

Since the gas-solid phases are mixed intensively at the top of fluid-
ized beds, concentrated solar radiation is often employed to directly heat
the reactive particles from the top of the reactor via a beam-down sys-
tem.  Kodama  et  al.  [137]  built  and  tested  a  30  kW  (solar  radiation)
fluidized bed reactor via a beam-down solar simulator system, as shown
in  Fig.  19.  The  major  materials  used  to  fabricate  the  receiver  were
Inconel and stainless steel. A quartz window was installed on the top of
the receiver with a diameter of 0.42 m, which allowed the high flux to
pass through. The concentrated solar radiation directly heated the top of
the fluidized bed, formed by quartz sand particles (100–500 μm and 4.8
kg). The static sand bed was cylindrical with a diameter of 16 cm and
length of 16 cm. At the bottom of the bed, a gas distributor with multiple
small holes (~0.5 mm diameter) was used to generate an internal cir-

The  external  wall  of  the  receiver  was  first  preheated  to  900

subsequently concentrated radiation was used to directly heat the flu-
idized  bed  at  the  power  of  15–30  kW.  The  experimental  results  sug-

shape, and solar input power, which should be properly optimized.

A similar fluidized bed reactor based on CaCO3/CaO materials was
developed by the Tregambi et al. [139]. The reactor was cylindrical with
0.1 m in diameter and 0.1 m in height, and under this aspect ratio, only
one  single  vortex  was  expected  for  the  emulsion  phase.  Two  ceramic
radiant heaters were employed to heat the reactor chamber. During the
operation, the top surface of the fluidized bed was subjected to radiation
from a simulated solar furnace (about 3.2 kW radiation). The reactant
gas was preheated before entering the wind box and fluidized bed. The
limestone  carbonation  reaction  was  operated  at  650
C  with  the  CO2

(see  Fig.  20).  The  reactor  was  composed  of  two  concentric  tubes,
forming  a  riser  region  and  an  annulus  region.  The  riser  region  was
enclosed by the inner tube, where fluidized particles were fed from the
bottom. The annulus region was the gap between the inner and outer
tubes, which was used to collect and recirculate particles. The outer tube
was  connected  to  a  conical  section,  which  was  enclosed  by  a  quartz
window. At the top of riser region, the fluidized particles were exposed
to  concentrated  flux  input,  and  the  reactor  can  be  safely  operated  at

et al. [140] also demonstrated a high thermal efficiency, defined as the
ratio of the thermal energy stored in solid particles to the total input
radiation,  of  70  %  based  on  non-reactive  particles  using  a  similar
equipment.

C. An average energy storage density of 1.0 GJ m

The  fluidized  bed  reactors  can  enhance  heat  transfer  and  enable
uniform  temperature  and  species  distributions.  Challenges  remain  in
terms of large pressure drop, high energy consumption, complex inter-
nal reacting flow, particle attrition, and difficulty in gas-solid separa-
tion, which must be overcome before the fluidized bed reactors can be
adopted in large scale TCES applications.

3.1.5. Entrained bed reactors

Entrained  bed  reactors  are  developed  for  large  power  plants,  in
which solid particles are entrained by the inlet gas and subsequently fed
into  the  reactor  chamber  together  with  the  gas  flow,  which  could  be
regarded as a special case of fluidized bed reactors. The biggest advan-
tage of entrained bed reactors is that the particles and gas are pre-mixed,
while  the  solid  and  gas  phases  can  be  separated  automatically  at  the
exits. However, the system is relatively complicated, and the gas-solid
mixing may be challenging depending on the materials used.

An atmospheric open, low-cost, and simple cyclone reactor without
moving components for the decomposition of CaCO3 was developed by

Imhof [141]. The CaCO3  particles were fed into the reactor through a
small tangential slot (see Fig. 21), and the air stream created a strong
vortex and high centrifugal force on the entrained particles, which were
then thrown to the cyclone wall and fell to the bottom. The mass ratio of
particles to conveying gas stream varied from 0.1 to 10. The particles
were then separated from the gas flow when the particle is big enough.
In  their  study,  the  maximum  size  of  the  fluidized  particles  was  kept
smaller than 10 μm. The exhaust gas mixture (CO2  and air) was then
expelled via a circular gap (or suction ring). The calcination reaction
occurred during the descent of particles along the cyclone wall, which
were exposed to concentrated solar radiation. The experimental results
suggested  that  even  though  the  reactor  was  atmospheric  open,  air
leakage was small. At low CO2  partial pressure of 136 Torr (or 0.179
◦
atm) and temperature of 1100
C, nearly 90 % of CaCO3 particles were
decomposed when the 100 μm particles resided in the reactor for about
1.3 s.

A  similar  conical  cyclone  reactor  with  concentrated  solar  beams
entering the open cavity via a windowless aperture was developed by
Steinfeld  et  al.  [52].  As  shown  in  Fig.  22,  CaCO3  particles  were
◦
decomposed at 1027
C heated by a solar thermal furnace. In the reactor,
the reactants were continuously fed, and the reaction products CaO and
CO2  were  separated  and  removed  simultaneously.  The  inlet  air  mass

flow rate was controlled at 6 kg h

size of 1–5 μm were fed at the rate of 0.6 kg h
perature can reach as high as 927–1177
C. The rate of sensible heat
stored in particles was about 1.01 kW, while about 0.28 kW of heat rate
was  stored  in  re-arranged  chemical  bonds  in  the  reaction  products
(assuming the reaction is complete). The energy absorption efficiency,
which  is  defined  as  the  ratio  of  energy  storage  rate  in  the  particles
(sensible  and  reaction  heat)  to  the  solar  energy  passing  through  the
receiver aperture, was  measured to be 43 %. The reactor can also  be
applied to the thermal decomposition of other carbonates and hydrox-
ides, e.g., CaCO3, MgCO3, Mg(OH)2, and Ca(OH)2  with large enthalpy
changes. However, the atmospheric open reactor may not be suitable for
the  reactions  for  coal/biomass  gasification,  in  which  a  window  is
required to separate the reaction products from air.

Entrained bed reactors are different from traditional fluidized bed
reactors as the solid and gas products can be simultaneously introduced
into  the  reaction  chamber  and  automatically  separated  at  the  exit.

Unfortunately, due to the complex structure and similar challenges to
traditional fluidized bed reactors, entrained bed reactors have not been
explored extensively for TCES applications.

3.2. Comparison of TCES reactors

4.1. Performance evaluation

The design and operation of a reactive-particle-based TCES reactor
are determined by many factors, including the nature of chemical re-
actants,  size  and  distribution  of  particles,  chemical  reaction  kinetics,
heat and mass transfer, operational mode, and flow patterns [25].

Many  performance  indicators  have  been  discussed  in  literature  to
quantify the performance of TCES reactors, among which energy storage
density, extent of reaction, and various energy efficiencies are the most
prevalent ones.

Table 4 presents the prototypes of different types of reactors with a
detailed comparison of energy storage materials, heat sources, cooling
method,  power  level,  reactor  wall  materials,  insulation  materials,
operating temperature, and solar-to-chemical efficiency. It is noted that
most exiting prototypes reported in the literature remain at the lab scale
with the input power level of 1–40 kW thermal, which is far away from
the requirement for large scale power plants at the level of MW. The
operating  temperatures  vary  significantly  from  300  to  2000
C
depending on the reaction reactants, reactor, and insulation materials,
as well as heat sources.

◦

Table 5 provides a comparison of different types of TCES reactors in
terms of their advantages and challenges [14,121,141,145]. Fixed bed
reactors  can  be  applied  to  particle  reactants  of  any  size,  are  easy  to
design,  construct,  and  operate,  and  are  relatively  simple  for  system
integration.  Due  to  the  nature  of  fixed  beds,  this  type  of  reactor  is
difficult to scale up with limited heat transfer capability and unable to
operate  continuously,  which  inhibits  the  rate  of  energy  storage  and
generation. Moving bed reactors allow the particles to move into and out
of the reactor chambers with different mass flow rates. In comparison
with fixed bed reactors, heat transfer capability is improved, while the
residence  time should  be controllable  and  optimized  for desirable  re-
action conversion [146]. For both fixed and moving particle beds that
are indirectly heated from concentrated solar radiation or electric fur-
naces,  achieving  uniform  temperature  distribution  within  the  bed  is
critical and remains challenging due to high thermal resistance between
the particle bed and reactor wall, especially for large sized tubular re-
actors.  To  further  enhance  heat  transfer,  rotary  bed  reactors  can  be
adopted; however, this type of reactors is difficult to scale up due to the
rotating reactor chamber, increased parasitic energy consumption, high
maintenance efforts and cost, and possible high system complexity for
large-scale solar system. The heat transfer can be even further enhanced
by  fluidizing  the  particle  reactants  in  fluidized  bed  reactors  and
entrained bed reactors. With fluidized beds, the particle reactants can
minimize hot or cold spots, with very high interstitial heat transfer co-
efficients  and  more  uniform  temperature  distribution.  However,  the
pressure drop, parasitic energy consumption, complex hydrodynamics
and granular flow behavior, particle attrition, and corrosion of internal
components are remaining challenges. In some studies, entrained bed
reactors are classified as fluidized bed reactors. In this review, entrained
bed reactors are discussed separately as they distinguish from traditional
fluidized  bed  reactors as  the solid  and  gas products  can be separated
automatically.

It is worth emphasizing again that many solar thermochemical re-
actors have been developed to split H2O and/or CO2  through two-step
redox  cycles  for  hydrogen/syngas  production  by  thermally  reducing
and oxidizing solid particles or porous structures (e.g., CeO2, SnO2, and
ZnO).  Those  prototype  reactors  can  potentially  be  modified  for  TCES
applications.  Their  representative  examples  include  fixed-bed  [39,46,
147–149],  moving-bed  [38,43,150],  rotary-bed  [44,45,151,152],  and
fluidized-bed reactors [40,41], and a number of review articles on this
topic can be found in the literature, e.g., Refs. [4,20,48].

4. TCES reactor characterization and assessment

A well-designed TCES reactor should be able to perform with high
energy conversion efficiency, fast practical reaction rate, optimal oper-
ating  temperature,  low  capital  and  operational  costs,  and  long  dura-
bility. Therefore, the characterization of TCES reactors is discussed in
three major aspects - performance, cost, and durability (e.g., material-
and component-level degradations).

(a)  Volumetric and gravimetric energy storage densities

Energy storage density is one of the most commonly used parameters
to characterize TCES materials and reactors, and is often defined as the
total energy stored during the charging step, Qstored, in [J] (kJ, MJ, or
MWh  are  often  used  in  the  literature),  divided  by  the  total  mass  or
volume of the reactive materials [153]. Those definitions for volumetric
(cid:0) 3] and gravimetric (mass) energy storage density (Dm) in
(DV) in [J⋅m
[J⋅kg

(cid:0) 1] can be written as follows
Qstored
Vbulk

DV =

(33)

(34)

Dm =

Qstored
m

where Vbulk is the bulk volume of the particle bed in [m3], and m is the
mass of particle bed in [kg]. The desired energy storage density is to be
as high as possible for a reduced weight or volume requirement. Fig. 23
provides  representative  volumetric  and  gravimetric  energy  storage
densities for some common TCES materials, and a more detailed sum-
mary can be found in Table 1.

It should be noted that in the above definitions the Qstored  does not
account for heat loss and parasitic energy inputs such as gas compression
and vacuum pumping. Therefore, the energy densities estimated using
these definitions are material specific. More importantly, it should be
emphasized that from the viewpoints of charge/discharge cycling and
TCES system design, the actual energy storage density of a TCES system
should be considered as the total energy released in the discharge step.
As such, the definitions in Eqs. (33) and (34) should be modified to

DV =

Qreleased
Vbulk

Dm =

Qreleased
m

(35)

(36)

In most TCES systems the reactive material serving as an energy carrier
is not cooled to room temperature for long duration storage [154]. In
such systems, Qreleased is the sum of the sensible heat (Qsensible) in [J] and
the chemical energy (Qchem) in [J]

Qreleased = Qsensible + Qchem

∫ TH

Qsensible =

mcpdT

TL

∫ TH

Qchem = n

ΔHrxndT

TL

(37)

(38)

(39)

where TH  and TL  are the upper and lower operating temperature limits
of the TCES system in [K], m is the instant mass of the storage media in
(cid:0) 1],
[kg], and cp  is the corresponding specific heat capacity in [J⋅kg
ΔHrxn  is  the  temperature-dependent  molar  enthalpy  of  reaction  in
(cid:0) 1], and n in [mol] is the total number of moles of gas reacted
[J⋅mol
when  the  storage  material  is  cooled  from  the  TH  to  TL.  To  avoid
confusion,  chemical  and  sensible  energy  capacities  should  be  clearly
delineated rather than lumped together, as the sensible energy storage is
relative to the specific discharge temperature desired.

(cid:0) 1⋅K

(cid:0) 1⋅K

The definition of Qreleased changes when the charged TCES medium is
cooled to room temperature for long duration energy storage, e.g., in

Ref.  [28].  In  such  systems,  reverse  reaction  during  cooling  to  room
temperature can be avoided by maintaining a very low partial pressure
of  gaseous  reactant.  The  stored  energy  is  recovered  by  heating  the
charged material again under a high partial pressure of gaseous reactant
to induce forward reaction. Qreleased  for such systems is given by

Qreleased = Qsensible + Qchem (cid:0) Qpreheat

(40)

where Qpreheat  in [J] is the energy needed to preheat the charged ma-
terial to a self-sustaining discharge temperature. The maximum value of
Qreleased  is preserved if the energy input to preheat the charged material
is completely recuperated [28], i.e., Qpreheat  = 0.

It should be noted that the energy storage densities of particle based
TCES reactive materials are not only affected by the amount of chemical
and sensible energy stored/released, but also determined by the volume
or  mass  of  reactive  materials  at  different  states.  Unfortunately,  many
studies  did  not  specify  how  and  under  what  conditions  the  energy
density of reactive materials was measured, and discrepancies exist in
the reported data on energy storage densities. For instance, in Rhodes
et al. [63]’s work, the gravimetric energy density is calculated based on
the initial mass of the SrO at fully reduced states, which may yield a
higher value of energy density in comparison of the mass of SrCO3  at
fully discharged states. However, in Ferchaud et al. [29]’s studies, the

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience102(2024)10114323

J. Zhao et al.

initial  mass  of  various  salt  hydrates,  such  as  CuSO4⋅5H2O  and
Li2SO4⋅H2O,  was  used  to  calculate  the  energy  storage  density  for  the
endothermic dehydration reactions, leading to a smaller reported energy
density. For instance, the energy storage density calculated based on the
mass of CuSO4⋅5H2O could be about 40.4 % smaller than that based on
the  mass  of  CuSO4⋅H2O  for  the  same  CuSO4⋅5H2O/CuSO4⋅H2O  dehy-
dration reaction. In Pardo et al. [155]’s studies, the volumetric energy
storage density is evaluated based on the volume of Ca(OH)2  for a Ca
(OH)2/CaO reaction system. Unfortunately, the measurement of mass or
bulk volume of reactive materials was often omitted in many studies,
making  it  difficult  to  compare  between  different  reactive  materials.
From material cycling and longevity viewpoints, the bulk volume and
mass in Eqs. (33) and (34) should be the maximum values for all stages
considered.

Furthermore, in addition to the intrinsic energy storage density of a
reactive material, one should also consider the storage density on the
reactor level as the particle bed may not achieve uniform temperature
and chemical conversion during the thermochemical reactions.

(b)  Extent of reaction

Extent of reaction is a parameter that measures the extent to which
the  reaction  has  proceeded.  It  can  be  determined  from  various  ap-
proaches for gas-solid reactions, such as mass change of solid reactants
(e.g., TGA experiments), energy absorption/release during the reaction
(TGA/DSC, drop calorimeter or acid-solution calorimeter [156,157]), or
through analyzing the gas product compositions.

For instance, in Schmidt et al.’s work on Ca(OH)2/CaO TCES systems
[125], the extent of reaction (α) is referred to as the conversion in per-
centage, and is defined as the mass ratio of water absorbed or released
during the Ca(OH)2/CaO chemical reactions (mH2O  in [kg]) to that in a
stoichiometric  (or  complete)  reaction  (mH2O,stoichiometric  in  [kg]),  as
shown in the following equation.

α =

mH2O
mH2O,stoichiometric

(41)

In Yan and Zhao’s study [158], the extent of reaction for Ca(OH)2/CaO
pairs is defined in a slightly different form. For the dehydration process,
the extent of reaction was calculated as follows,

αde =

74mH2O
18mCa(OH)2

(42)

where mCa(OH)
2  is the initial mass of Ca(OH)2 powder at the beginning of
dehydration, and mH2O  is the mass of water produced in a practical re-
action. For the hydration reaction, the extent of reaction can be calcu-
lated as follows,

αhy =

56mH2O
18mCaO

(43)

Randhir et al. [28,156], Korba et al. [23], and Huang et al. [105]
defined the extent of reaction based on the mass changes of particles for
the Mg–Mn–O redox reactions as

α =

m (cid:0) mred
mox (cid:0) mred

(44)

where m is the mass of solid reactants in [kg], and the subscripts “ox”
and “red” represent the equilibrium conditions at the reference oxidized
(1500
C,  0.9  atm  pO2 )  states,
respectively.

C,  0.01  atm  pO2 )  and  reduced  (1000

◦

◦

Wokon  et  al.  [82]  defined  standardized  extent  of  conversion  for

particle-based redox reaction as follows.

αred =

minitial (cid:0) m
minitial (cid:0) mfinal

(45)

αox =

m (cid:0) minitial
mfinal(cid:0) minitial

= 1 (cid:0) αred

(46)

where minitial and mfinal are the initial and final mass of particles prior to
and after a reduction reaction, and m is the mass of specimen at any
time. Similar to Randhir et al. [28,156], this definition can accommo-
date  potential  differences  between  the  stoichiometric  and  thermody-
namic extent of a particular reaction.

In  some  cases,  the  extent  of  reaction  can  be  calculated  indirectly
through  the  energy  stored  and/or  released  in  an  actual  reactor.  For
example, in Tescari et al.’s experimental work [80] on Co3O4/CoO re-
actions, the extent of reaction (also referred to as chemical conversion)
is defined based on the energy analysis as follows

α =

Qstored (cid:0) Qsens,ideal
Qchem,ideal

(47)

where  Qstored  is  the  total  energy  stored  in  reactants  in  the  forms  of
chemical  and  sensible  energy,  Qsens,ideal  is  the  ideal  sensible  energy
stored in reactants which can be calculated from the ideal temperature
rise before and after the reaction, and Qchem,ideal  is the maximum theo-
retical chemical energy stored in the reactants. In this study, a storage
performance  factor  (PF)  is  proposed  to  assess  the  completion  of  the
charge/discharge reactions.

PF =

Qstored
Qideal

=

Qchem + Qsens
Qchem,ideal + Qsens,ideal

(48)

In  conclusion,  there  are  many  approaches  to  defining  and  measuring
reaction extent. In simple terms, it is the amount of reaction progress
that  occurs  divided  by  the  amount  possible.  In  contrast  to  classical
chemical reaction engineering where stoichiometry has typically used to
define  what  is  possible,  in  TCES  literature  we  see  the  emergence  of
thermodynamically constrained reactions where stoichiometry is not a
good indicator of the theoretical maximum reaction progress. The dif-
ference between the actual and theoretical extent is a driving force for
forward reaction and can impact the effective kinetics of the reaction.

(c)  Energy efficiency

chem) and sensible heat (Qc

The  energy  flow  in  a  typical  CSP-  or  renewable  electricity-driven
TCES system is shown in Fig. 24. With CSP, the total solar energy (Qso-
lar,in  in  [J])  enters  the  solar  receiver,  a  portion  of  which  will  be  re-
radiated to the ambient through the aperture [47]. The target receiver
thermal efficiency set by the US Department of Energy (DOE) is above
90 % [159]. While in an electricity-driven TCES system, the charging
reactor is heated by electric furnaces powered by renewable electricity
(Qele,in  in [J]). The absorbed solar thermal energy or heat input from
electric  furnaces  (Qc
th)  is  primarily  converted  to  the  chemical  energy
(Qc
sens) of TCES materials in the charge unit,
while  a  portion  of  the  energy  is  dissipated  into  the  ambient  via  con-
duction, convection, and radiation [160]. While the sensible part of the
stored  energy is  mainly  for  short  term  storage  (due  to  thermal  losses
during  storage,  the  available  sensible  heat  Qdc
sens  at  discharge  will  be
lower  than  Qc
sens),  the  chemical  energy  stored  can  be  used  for  long
duration  (the  chemical  energy  available  at  discharge  Qdc
chem  can  be
approximately equal to Qc
chem) [28]. In the discharge unit, the available
chemical  and  sensible  energy  (Qdc
sens  and  Qdc
chem)  will  be  converted  or
transferred to thermal energy (Qdc
th ) again. The discharge step in TCES is
normally at higher temperature compared to typical sensible or latent
heat-based energy storage systems, and the discharge of chemical en-
ergy  can  be  on  demand  by  controlling  the  exothermic  reaction.  The
energy  output  in  a  TCES  system,  as  shown  in  Fig.  24,  can  be  either
electric energy (Qele,out  in [J]) through a power block or thermal energy
(Qth,out in [J]) for various industrial processes. For electric power output,
a heat exchanger is typically required to transfer the high-temperature

High-temperature TCES technologies are attractive in general as they
can enable high power cycle efficiency (ηoutput
th(cid:0) ele in Fig. 24); while the high
temperature in each component could also lead to higher heat loss if it is
not well managed. The related receiver thermal efficiency, ηinput
solar(cid:0) th, can
be  calculated  as  follows  by  considering  the  optical  and  re-radiation
losses.

The solar energy available from a heliostat,

determined  by  the  average  direct  normal  irradiation,  I,  in  [W⋅m
which varies geographically (e.g., 1000 [161], 950 [162], 818 [163],
(cid:0) 2 [54] were used), multiplied by the designed area of the
and 500 W m
heliostat, Ahelio, in [m2].
 ̇Qsolar,helio = IAhelio

(49)

Due to optical losses, only a portion of the total solar radiation collected
by the heliostat can be concentrated and enter the aperture of the solar

can thus be determined.

◦

The receiver temperature is thus elevated to the charging tempera-
C.  However,  re-radiation losses  to the
ture, which  can be  over 1000

ergy  loss  due  to  radiation  from  the  high-temperature  aperture,

In addition, various other forms of energy efficiencies have been defined
in different studies to characterize TCES reactors and systems, with most
of  them  focusing  on  the  evaluation  of  the  efficiencies  related  to  the
separate  charge  and  discharge  reactors,  i.e.,  the  thermal-to-chemical
efficiency, ηc

ficiency, ηdc
chem(cid:0) th, in the discharge reactor (some are listed in Table 4),
from which the round-trip efficiency considering both reactors, and the
overall efficiency considering all major processes, can be calculated.

In particular, with a moving-bed tubular reactor design powered by
an electric furnace for thermochemical reduction of Mg–Mn–O particles

ηsolar(cid:0) chem

fraction of solar thermal energy that is converted and stored in chemical

strate that the ηsolar(cid:0) chem  can be as high as 9.5–20 % [83,144].

As shown in Fig. 24, depending on the specific energy input, Qin could be
solar  thermal  Qsolar,in  or  electric  energy  Qele,in,  and  the  energy output

th(cid:0) ele/th  is the conversion

preliminary  assessment  of  process  viability.  Once  the  processes  look
viable on paper, it is customary to test a TCES concept on an experi-
mental test rig. Experimental data can be used for a more rigorous es-
timate of ηoverall. For a prototype TCES system producing electricity or

compress gases, to pull vacuum or separate gases, to transport solids, to

equipment.

It is worth mentioning that for solar fuel production reactions, the
solar-to-fuel efficiency, similar to solar-to-chemical efficiency, is often
employed to characterize the fuel production rate and efficiency [169,
170]. Chueh et al. [47] defined the solar-to-fuel efficiency (ηsolar(cid:0) fuel) for
the dissociation of CO2 or H2O based on CeO2 particles as follows

experimental  studies  in  prototypes  is  only  0.15–5.6  %  [39,46,148,
169–171]. With heat recovery, however, it was shown that efficiencies
up to 9.82 % can be achieved for a 4 kW solar reactor and 14.7 % for a
50 kW reactor [166].

4.2. Cost evaluation

The cost analysis or techno-economic analysis of TCES systems are
insufficiently reported in literature, while the extensive investigation on
particle-based sensible heat storage systems can provide some insights to
the  analysis  of  particle-based  TCES  systems  [51,163,172,173].  The
levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of the TCES devices, including solar
receiver, reactors, particle lift, storage bins, and power blocks (including
primary heat exchanger (PHE), recuperators, condenser, compressors,
and  turbines)  can  be  estimated  via  the  equations  in  Table  S2  of  the
Supplementary Material. However, it is observed that the cost of TCES
system components varies significantly in different correlation models,
and  the  cost  analysis  for  specific  TCES  systems  should  be  carefully
performed considering the validity of the cost corrections for equipment
with different sizes and materials.

C) and energy storage capacity may limit their power generation
(~500
efficiency. SrCO3 and BaCO3 have the highest discharge temperature at
above 1150
C, which allows the highest thermal efficiency of power
blocks.  High  efficiency  power  block  operation,  however,  does  not
necessarily translate to higher round-trip efficiency, as high temperature
processes  also  have  greater  losses.  Interestingly,  Bayon  et  al.  [174]
found that cycle thermal efficiency was not associated with lower cost
on a per unit energy basis. Instead, volumetric energy storage density
was a stronger determinant, as that impacts vessel sizes. Regardless of
the cost drivers, the costs projected by Bayon et al. [174] are still higher

than the U.S. Department of Energy targets for thermal storage ($15 per
kWhth) [175].

As  TCES  is  a  relatively  nascent  field,  cost  projections  for  various
specialized equipment should be taken with a given amount of uncer-
tainty.  More  work  and  experience  are  needed  to  determine  costs  for
components constructed from advanced materials at scales never before
seen  in  their  respective  industries.  Many  of  the  chemical  species
involved  have  non-trivial  material  compatibility  issues  with  conven-
tional materials of construction and will require that vessels have inert
lining or coating for long term operation. New fabrication techniques (e.
g., additive manufacturing) and new materials will force the community
to recalculate their cost correlations. Schemes where solids are stored at
lower temperatures forfeit additional sensible storage but may have the
potential  for  drastically  reducing  capital  costs.  In  addition,  processes
where  solids  are  continuously  processed  would  decouple  storage  ca-
pacity  and  reactor  volume,  analogous  to  flow  batteries. The  practical
TCES  system  design  should  consider  both  technical  feasibility  and
techno-economic factors.

4.3. Durability evaluation

The durability of TCES systems can be affected by two major aspects,

including reactive materials and reactor components.

(a)  Reactive material degradation

The  reactive  materials  for  TCES  can  degrade  due  to  impurity,  by
sintering,  and  with  “channeling”  issues  [59,124].  The  degradation  of
TCES  materials  can  affect  the  reversibility  of  charge/discharge  re-
actions, cyclic performance, and thermal/chemical stability [176]. TCES
materials with fast degradation rates may result in frequent replacement
of materials, increase of maintenance cost, and interruption of contin-
uous  operations  [7].  Sintering  can  cause  the  growth  of  particle  size
during operation, and larger particle sizes often lead to reduced surface

area  (or  reaction  sites),  meaning  the  utilization  of  reactive  particles
becomes low. For specific TCES materials, e.g., CaCO3/CaO pairs, the
CaO particles can be poisons by impurity in gas reactants, e.g., water
vapor,  reducing  the  cyclic  performance  of  CaCO3/CaO  systems.  Both
sintering  and  impurity  will  negatively  and  gradually  impact  the
reversibility and energy storage capacity. “Channeling” issues are often
◦
found in fixed bed reactors, e.g., Ca(OH)2/CaO at 400–600
C [124], in
which large agglomerates and large-size channels are formed. The gas
reactants tend to flow through visible channels, with a large portion of
the reactant sites not utilized. Additives, e.g., SiO2 nanoparticles (2 wt%,
7 nm), can stabilize Ca(OH)2/CaO particles at high temperature (e.g.,
1000
C),  avoid  side  reactions,  and  inhibit  agglomerations  to  some

(b)  Reactor components

The contamination of quartz window [150] is one of the common
failure  modes  for  solar  receiver  reactors.  The  quartz  window  can  be
contaminated  by  moving  particles,  which  may  either  block  the  solar
radiation or increase the window temperature due to heat absorption,
which may result in limited energy input or cracking of glass windows
[38].

The  reactor  materials  will  experience  strong  thermal  stresses,  hot
temperature, and corrosive environment during the cyclic charge and
discharge process. Depending on the operating temperature, the reactor
interior wall can be made of metal alloys, alumina, concrete, ceramic, or
other materials, as presented in Table 4. In some scenarios, the reactor
wall is also subject to high operating pressure and attacks by high-speed
solid  particles.  Therefore,  the  reactor  wall  can  be  corroded  and  even
cracked during operation.

The reactors should be properly insulated to maintain high operating
temperature for desired chemical reaction and kinetics and to minimize
thermal loss for improved energy conversion efficiency. Ceramic mate-
rial, e.g., alumina, is one of the most common insulation materials for
TCES reactors [43,46,47,130,150], and for extremely high temperature,
ZrO2  [149] can be employed (See Table 4 for some common materials
used in TCES reactor prototypes). A failed insulation system can lead to
decreased  insufficient  operating  temperature  with  potential  side  re-
actions or slow reaction kinetics.

5. TCES reactor scale up and integration with the power block

The rate of energy storage by the charging reactor and that of power
generation by the discharging reactor are determined by the design, size,
scale, and operating conditions. Most of the reactor prototypes reported
in literature were developed to demonstrate the feasibility and perfor-
mance of TCES materials and reactor design at an input power of less
than 40 kW (see Table 4). However, it may require hundreds and even
thousands of such reactors to develop a MW-level power plant, which is
challenging in thermal management and cost reduction.

Scaling up the rector with increased volume-to-area ratio is the key
to  inhibiting  energy  losses  through  conduction  and  convection  [44].
However, the scale up of the reactors and system integration at the level
of 0.1–100 MW are mostly at the design stage, and very limited data are
publicly available. Therefore, this section focuses on the current devel-
opment  status  and  technical  challenges  in  the  scaling  up  of  TCES  re-
actors and the corresponding power system integration at the level of
over 0.1–100 MW (see Fig. 26). It should be mentioned that the explicit
definition of the scale of TCES reactors is not consistent and may vary
significantly with diverse criteria. For example, Rüdisüli et al. [178] and
Kelkar and Ng [179] classified the scales of reactors according to the size
of  fluidized  bed  reactors,  e.g.,  lab-scale  reactors  (~0.2  m  in  size),
pilot-scale reactors (~0.5 m), and full-scale reactors (>0.5 m). However,
TCES  reactors  are  also  often  classified  at  different  power  levels,  e.g.,
lab-scale reactors (~kW) [148,180] and pilot-scale reactors (~100 kW)
[66,181], while many packed-bed reactors are referred to as lab-scale
reactors [117,124].

5.1. Reactor scale-up

Scaling  up  of  reactors  is  the  process  to  develop  pilot  or  industrial

reactors based on the knowledge of smaller lab-scale experiments. The
objectives of reactors scale-up are to establish the criteria to transition
the lab-scale reactors into an industry-scale reactor while preserving the
equivalent  or  improved  performance  as  the  reactor  size  increases.
However,  many  testing  and  trialing efforts  are  needed  to modify  and
optimize the reactor design, operating conditions, and control strategies
before a lab-scale reactor can be successfully transferred to the industry-
scale reactors [182].

There are no general rules to scale up the reactors to meet the power,
efficiency,  or  particle-conversion  targets  for  an  industry-scale  TCES
plant.  The  challenges  come  from  the  discrepancies  of  kinetic  data  in
various  reaction  systems  at  different  scales,  e.g.,  lab-,  pilot-,  and
industry-scale,  in  which  reaction  kinetics  may  be  masked  by  various
transport phenomena and inaccurately measured. The apparatus used in
industry-scale reactors may be completely different from lab-scale re-
actors, in which the same reactions can be carried out in different con-
ditions and phases within a fixed, moving, or fluidized bed [183].

In a lab-scale reactor, the reaction process is investigated by utilizing
a relatively small amount of TCES materials, and the physicochemical
phenomena that are independent of reactor sizes, e.g., chemical ther-
modynamics  and  kinetics,  are  examined  through  experiments  [183,
184]. Critical physicochemical properties, including density, porosity,
viscosity, specific heat, effective conductivity, permeability, and effec-
tive diffusion coefficient, can be measured at this stage to provide the
best knowledge for model development and scale-up design of reactors
[182]. Computational modeling techniques that are rigorously validated
against lab-scale reactor data can be applied to assist the understanding,
analysis, and improvement of the scale-up design process.

A pilot reactor is often needed before transferring the lab-scale re-
actors to industry-scale  reactors to prove that the large-scale reactors
can achieve equivalent performance and to investigate the phenomena
that are not dominant on the lab-scale [185]. In the pilot reactor, re-
action products, energy storage or output, and control strategies should
be  examined  to  provide  sufficient  knowledge  for  the  development  of
industrial plants. The design of pilot reactors varies over a wide range of
power  levels  and  sizes,  which  takes  into  account  the  industrial  con-
straints (e.g., operation hours, control strategies, component limitation,
reactant impurity, and material durability) based on lab-scale data. The
pilot reactor should represent part of the industry-scale reactor, in which
physical  and  chemical  phenomena  can  be  simultaneously  examined
[182]. In  the  actual reactor  development  process,  a  pilot  plant  is  not

J. Zhao et al.

always necessary, for example, if a similar industrial plant has already
been available and the industrial constraints can be properly evaluated
[183]. At this stage, process and economic analysis can be employed as
an  effective  approach to  narrow down  the  design of  interests, reduce
experimental efforts, optimize control/operating strategies, and accel-
erate the research, design, and development process.

The  industry-scale  (or  full-scale)  reactors  aim  to  maximize  profit
while minimizing the cost, which can be operated safely and reliably
over the entire designed lifetime. The reactor should be easy for system
integration, yield optimal system performance, and can be coupled with
properly selected and designed power blocks. Techno-economic analysis
can be employed at this stage to ensure the successful commercialization
of the reactor systems at the industrial scale.

Although there exist no universal criteria available for reactor scale-
up design, some general criteria are given in Refs. [178,183,186–188]
for the scale-up of chemical reactors with different scaling laws. How-
ever, these scaling up methods can only be used as a reference; further
detailed modeling and experimental verification should be conducted to
ensure the success of the specific design at different stages, as shown in
Fig.  27. Challenges  come  from the heat  and mass  transfer  limitations
which  may  not  be  important  at  the  lab  scale  but  may  emerge  upon
scale-up  [185].  Internal  and  local  variations  in  temperature,  particle
status,  and  reactant  distribution  are  difficult  to  accurately  analyze,
which may make the actual reactor design very different from the ideal
reactors. Therefore, modeling and simulations techniques are important
tools  in  a  TCES  reactor  scale-up  design  in  addition  to  experimental
studies.

5.2. Integration of TCES reactor with the power block

At  the  discharging  stage,  the  energy  stored  in  chemical  bonds  is
released  in  the  form  of  thermal  energy  at  elevated  temperature  via
exothermic reactions. The released thermal energy can be transferred
into  electric  or  mechanical  energy  via  a  power  block,  where  thermo-
dynamic cycles are employed. The most commonly used thermodynamic
power  cycles  include  steam  Rankine  cycle,  air  Brayton  cycle,  super-
critical CO2 (sCO2) cycle, and combined cycles [189–193]. On the other
hand, the high-temperature heat released can also be directly used for
industrial process heat [28].

As limited experimental data on the TCES systems integrated with
power blocks are available in the literature, some potential discharge
solutions  that  have  been  tested  and  demonstrated  in  non-reactive

particle-based energy storage plants are investigated through thermo-
dynamic analysis, and their potential performance and system cost can
be found in Table 6. For instance, direct CO2  Brayton cycles were pro-
posed in Refs. [162,194] for CaCO3/CaO systems to extract useful en-
ergy,  demonstrating  a  LCOE  of  0.18–0.25  $/kWh  for  a  period  of  25
years. Direct air Brayton cycles were proposed for Co3O4/CoO systems in
Refs. [99,159,160], in which air was used for both reactants and heat
transfer  fluids.  In-direct  steam  Rankine  cycles  were  proposed  for  Ca
(OH)2/CaO  systems  in  Refs.  [195,196],  and  its  annual  LCOE  can  be
$0.118-$0.163/kWh. In-direct sCO2  Brayton cycles were proposed for
CaCO3/CaO, Ca(OH)2/CaO, and Mn2O3/Mn3O4 systems, and the LCOE
can be around 0.12–0.15 $/kWh for a service period of 30 years.

As  seen  in  Table  6,  the  power  block  systems  are  categorized  into
direct  and  indirect  discharge  systems,  depending  on  whether  the
working fluids of thermodynamic power cycles are directly contacted
with the reaction bed.

5.2.1. Direct discharge system

◦

For most redox reactors, air can be used in the discharge reactors as
both reactants and heat transfer fluids. In this case, compressed air is
directly contacted with reactive particles, heated by reaction heat, and
can be used to power an air based thermodynamic cycle (see Fig. 28).
The  benefits  of  the  direct  air  Brayton  cycle  are  the  enhanced  heat
transfer  between  working  fluids  (compressed  air)  and  the  high-
temperature reactive particles, the low cost due to the abundance and
cost-free  atmospheric  air,  and  the  high  efficiency  due  to  good  flow
property  up  to  700
C  [199].  However,  only  a  few  commercial  TES
plants utilize air as the working fluid, for example, a 1.5 MW solar tower
constructed  in  Jülich,  Germany  [18],  and  a  1.3  MW  G3P3-KSA  solar
tower being developed at King Saud University, in which an air Brayton
cycle with a nominal capacity of 2 MW was adopted [15,55]. Challenges
may come from the coupling of reactors with air Brayton cycle, in which
the temperature and pressure of air can simultaneously affect the output
of reactors and the thermal efficiency of the power cycle. Unfortunately,
little  knowledge  on  the  reaction-thermodynamics-cycle  optimization
has been reported in the literature. In practical TCES system design, the
air Brayton cycle can be optimized with multiple stages of compressor
and turbine generators coupled with proper recuperators to enhance the
overall  thermal  efficiency.  More  details  about  the  system  design  and
optimization for air Brayton cycle can be found elsewhere in Refs. [199,
200]. Some other gas species such as water vapor and CO2 may poten-
tially  be  used  as  heat  transfer  fluids  to  directly  interact  with

parameters  can  affect  the  performance  of  reactors,  indirect  discharge
systems that coupled with Rankine cycles (steam or organic fluids) and
supercritical CO2 (sCO2) cycles have been widely investigated to extract
heat from the reactors indirectly through a heat exchanger [165,201].
Through an indirect discharge system, the working fluids of the power
blocks  do  not  have  to  contact  with  the  reactants  in  the  discharge  re-
actors, which can avoid impurities and particulate dusts in the working
fluid,  enable  various  types  of  working  fluids,  and  address  the  large
pressure difference between the reactants and power blocks [198].

Steam Rankine cycle is one of the most commonly used power cycle
in  practical  large-scale  solar  power  plants  (at  least  94  existing  solar
power plants) at the power level of 1–200 MW according to SolarPACES,
an  international  program  of  the  International  Energy  Agency  [15].
Organic Rankine cycles with higher thermal efficiency are also adopted
in solar power plants (at lease 4 organic Rankine cycle based solar plants
were  reported  to  be  operational),  while  the  power  level  is  relatively
lower at 1–5.5 MW [15]. Bayon et al. [174] pointed out the subcritical
Rankine  cycles  are  suitable  for  the  reactor  temperature  range  of
◦
450–600
C, which is typical for the hydration of CaO, SrO, and BaO, as
well as  the carbonation of (CaMg)O2,  La2O3  and  MgO. A detailed ex-
amination  of  the  working  fluids  for  organic  Rankine  cycle  that  are
suitable for power generation can be found in Bao and Zhao’s studies
[190]. The  selection  of  proper  working  fluids  for  an  organic  Rankine
cycle should be based on the desired reactor temperature [202].

sCO2 cycle is an emerging technology for power generation, which is
being introduced to large-scale solar power plants [15]. For instance, the

it still requires significant research efforts before it can be adopted in
practical TCES systems.

shown in Fig. 29. sCO2 cycles can be adopted for the reactor temperature

and  MnO.  sCO2  cycles  are  advantageous  in  terms  of  higher  energy
conversion  efficiency,  less  corrosion,  and  compact  turbomachinery
[203–205]. Various sCO2 cycle configurations have been developed for
power generation, including simple, partial cooling, and recompression
cycles [206,207]. Among these configurations, recompression sCO2 cy-
cles have been widely investigated in CSP applications due to its higher
efficiency  than  simple  sCO2  cycles  and  less  complex  structure  than
partial cooling sCO2  cycles, as shown in Fig. 30. More detailed intro-
duction to the power blocks for large-scale power plants integrated with
non-reactive  particle-based  thermal  energy  storage  systems  can  be
found elsewhere such as in Refs. [15,208].

6. Discussion and future perspectives

Based  on  the  present  comprehensive  review  of  the  particle-based
high-temperature  TCES  reactors,  the  challenges  and  opportunities  for
TCES reactor development have been identified as follows.

6.1. Challenges

(a)  Novel chemistry and reactive material

The selection of the TCES reactive material determines the thermo-
chemical reaction thermodynamics and energy storage performance (e.
g., enthalpy of reaction, extent of reaction, material longevity, and en-
ergy storage density), which dictates the reactor design and the power
block integration. Pursuit and discovery of novel chemistry and reactive
materials and approaches to improve the exiting materials’ reactivity is
potentially transformative.

(b)  Heat source for charging reactions

The endothermic charging reaction for TCES requires external ther-
mal input, while the heat sources for TCES systems can vary depending
on the specific thermochemical materials and processes employed. The
heat  source  can  come  from  solar  energy  (especially  CSP),  waste  heat

from industrial processes, excess electricity from the grid, geothermal
heat, and other sustainable sources. The choice of heat source depends
on the specific thermochemical reaction, as well as factors such as the
geographic location, available resources, and environmental consider-
ations. According to the literature review, a large portion of the research
efforts are devoted to couple TCES with CSP plants, which is one of the
most  promising  and  challenging  directions  for  the  TCES  technology
development.

(c)  Reliable and durable reactor material

The material selection for housing and containing the reactive ma-
terial  is  crucial  for  system  design  and  operation,  including  operating
temperature and pressure. The reactor interior surface may be subject to
high temperatures, corrosion, and/or high pressure, depending on the
TCES reactive materials and types of reactions. Therefore, the reactor
material should be non-reactive with the TCES reactive material, be able
to  withstand  high  temperatures,  resist  corrosion,  be  mechanically
strong, reliable, and durable for cyclic operations.

(d)  Reaction kinetics

Understanding the reaction kinetics is crucial to determine the rate of
chemical  reaction  at  different  operating  conditions,  such  as  tempera-
ture, pressure, and concentration of reactants. The knowledge of reac-
tion kinetics for TCES materials is still insufficient and not thorough in
the  literature,  especially  for  emerging  and  novel  materials.  Accurate
measurement  of the  intrinsic kinetics and  development of reliable  ki-
netic models are essential for designing and operating the TCES reactors
at optimal conditions.

(e)  Heat and mass transfer

Efficient heat transfer is critical to TCES reactors, as the temperature
distribution affects the rate of chemical reaction, thereby determining the
rate of energy absorption or release. Mass transfer is another important
factor that impacts the rate of chemical reaction, as the gas-solid reaction
can only proceed efficiently when reactants are promptly supplied to the
reaction sites and the products are promptly removed. As reviewed in this
work, five types of TCES reactors feature quite different heat and mass
transfer characteristics. CFD models are a powerful tool to simulate the
coupled transport phenomena in TCES reactors.

(f)  Reactor design and demonstration

are crucial to the compact, efficient, and cost-effective reactor and TCES
system designs.

Effective  reactor  design  to  provide  a  suitable  environment  for  the
reactive  material  to  realize  controlled  thermochemical  reactions  is
indispensable. Additionally, reactor testing to verify feasible design and
demonstration of a scaled reactor is probably the most important chal-
lenge  in  TCES  technology  development,  especially  when  most  TCES
reactors are merely demonstrated in a laboratory setting. In addition to
typical  challenges  encountered in  chemical reactor  design  and opera-
tion, the high operating temperature and required thermal-to-chemical
and  chemical-to-thermal  energy  conversion  steps  in  the  charge/
discharge reactors will also bring in unique challenges.

(b)  Advanced model development

Advanced models are urgently needed in aspects of chemical kinetics
and transport phenomena (e.g., gas-particle-wall interactions, gas/par-
ticle flow patterns, and multiscale effective transport properties), which
are important for the scaling up of reactors and the corresponding power
system  integration.  Accurate  and  effective  modeling  approaches  can
contribute to the comprehension of internal processes, reduce  experi-
mental efforts, and optimize the reactor design at different scales.

(g)  Safety concerns

(c)  Novel TCES reactor design and experimental demonstration

As  TCES  reactors  deal  with  highly  concentrated  solar  radiation,
exothermic  reactions,  extremely  high  temperature,  and  possible  haz-
ardous  by-products,  procedures  and  approaches  to  ensure  the  safe
operation of TCES reactors should be properly designed to protect op-
erators and the environment. Unlike inert particle-based sensible heat
storage, TCES particles are by definition reactive, leading to potential
hazards.

(h)  Economic impacts

The  costs  of  raw  materials,  construction  of  reactors,  accessories,
maintenance, and labor are important for the net benefits of TCES sys-
tems.  Economic  impacts  should  be  carefully  assessed  to  balance  the
performance of TCES reactor and investment.

6.2. Opportunities

(a)  Advanced materials

The  development  of  novel  TCES  reactive  materials  may  lead  to
improved reactivity, longevity, and durability, as well as increased en-
ergy density and the resulting higher storage capacity and power gen-
eration,  which  is  important  to  design  compact  reactors.  High-
temperature  resistant  and  corrosion  resistant  housing  materials  are
crucial to the reactor inner surface, and effective insulation materials are
important for the reactor and storage tanks to be operated at desirable
temperatures. In general, advanced materials with enhanced properties

As reviewed in this paper, various TCES reactor concepts have been
studied  worldwide  with  a  few  of  them  proved  from  bench-scale  pro-
totypes, and each type of particle-based reactors has their own benefits
and  shortcomings.  Novel  reactor  designs,  such  as  those  incorporating
heat recovery/recuperation, integrating solar receiver with the charging
reactor, and combining the discharging reactor with heat exchangers,
are  urgently  needed  to  push  the  TCES  technology  development,
demonstration, and deployment.

(d)  Reactor scale-up and power system integration

Many efforts have been devoted to the lab- and pilot-scale reactors
design,  while  the  reactor  scale-up  holds  the  key  to  the  commercial
success of TCES applications. Criteria for scaling up different types of
reactors  assisted  with  advanced  modeling  techniques  based  on  the
fundamental knowledge obtained from TGA or lab-scale reactors will be
of significant interest. In addition, the integration of the scaled-up re-
actors with efficient power blocks will impact the overall TCES system
performance and costs.

(e)  Contribution to industrial decarbonization

With the inherent benefit of being able to release high-temperature
heat, TCES is well poised to substantially contribute to the decarbon-
ization of a number of energy-intensive and green house gas emission-
intensive
renewable
electricity-driven TCES with electric furnace heating for the discharging

industrial  processes.  More

step, which is decoupled from geographically dependent CSP fields, can
readily be employed in any location where a specific industrial process is
in operation. Future work on critical component development to inte-
grate the electric grid to the TCES charging reactor, and effectively and
economically transfer the released heat from the discharging reactor to
the industrial process is urgently needed.

7. Conclusions

Gas-solid  thermochemical  energy  storage  (TCES)  is  a  promising
technology in storing and utilizing renewable energy such as concen-
trating  solar  power  (CSP)  and  excess  electricity  from  all  types  of  re-
newables  due  to  its  high  energy  storage  density,  ultra-long  storage
period, and efficient power generation at high discharge temperature.

sintering and agglomeration of solid particles remain the challenges for
practical applications. Metal oxide redox reactions can be at high tem-

reactions. Recent efforts were also devoted into mixed metal oxides to
improve  the  cyclic  stability, lower  reaction  temperature,  enhance the

To  demonstrate  the  feasibility  of  proposed  chemistry  and  reactive
materials,  various  TCES  reactors  have  been  developed.  They  can  be
categorized into fixed, moving, rotary, fluidized, and entrained bed re-
actors according to the gas-solid flow patterns. Almost all prototypes in
the  literature  are  limited  to  lab-scale  operations  with  thermal  input
below  40  kW.  And  their  nominal  bed  temperatures vary  from  300  to
1500
C, depending on the selected chemistry, reactive  material, and
heat sources. Fixed bed reactors are suitable for particles of any size, and
straightforward to design, construct, and integrate into systems. How-
ever,  the  difficulty  in  scaling  up,  heat  transfer  limitation,  and  non-
continuous operation are major challenges. Moving bed reactors allow
particles  to flow in and out with varying mass flow rates and exhibit
improved  heat  transfer  and  energy  storage  capabilities  compared  to
fixed  bed  reactors.  However,  particle  flowability  and  residence  time
control  to  maximize  extent  of  reaction  can  be  challenging.  For  both
fixed- and moving-bed reactors indirectly heated by concentrated solar
radiation or electric furnaces, achieving uniform bed temperature dis-
tribution  is  challenging  due  to  high  thermal  resistance  between  the
particle bed and reactor wall, especially in large tubular reactors. Rotary
bed reactors can enhance heat transfer, but their scalability is hindered
by challenges such as the rotating reactor chamber, increased parasitic
energy consumption, high maintenance efforts and costs, and potential
system complexity in large-scale solar systems. Fluidized and entrained
bed  reactors  can  further  enhance  heat  transfer  and  achieve  more

uniform  temperature  distributions.  The  challenges  for  fluidized  bed
reactor,  however,  include  high  pressure  drops,  parasitic  energy  con-
sumption,  particle  attrition,  and  corrosion  of  internal  components.
Entrained  bed  reactors,  which  pre-mix  gas-solid  reactants  and  auto-
matically  separate  solid  and  gas  phases,  face  similar  limitations  as
general fluidized bed reactors.

TCES  reactors  can  be  assessed  from  three  major  aspects  –  perfor-
mance, cost, and durability. The key performance metrics include en-
ergy storage density, extent of reaction, and energy efficiency. However,
discrepancies in their definitions were observed in the literature, making
it extremely difficult to make direct comparisons between various re-
actors. The cost analysis or techno-economic analysis of TCES systems
are  rarely  reported  in  the  literature.  The  levelized  cost  of  electricity
(LCOE)  of  TCES-based  power  plants  should  include  the  costs  of  solar
receivers  (if  driven  by  CSP),  reactors,  particle  lift,  storage  bins,  and
power blocks. However, it is observed that the cost correlations of re-
actors at different scales have not been well documented, and those of
other  components  vary  significantly  in  different  correlation  models.
Further research and practical experience are necessary to evaluate the
costs for components constructed from advanced materials at different
volumes of manufacturing in their respective industries. Many chemical
species  involved  in  TCES  exhibit  material  compatibility  issues  with
conventional construction materials, which may require inert linings or
coatings for long-term operation. The development of new fabrication
techniques, such as additive manufacturing, and the use of novel ma-
terials will necessitate a re-evaluation of cost correlations. Storing solids
at  lower  temperatures  may  sacrifice  some  sensible  storage  but  could
potentially lead to significant reduction in capital costs. Additionally,
continuous  processing  of  solids  could  decouple  storage  capacity  from
reactor volume, resembling the principles seen in flow batteries. Prac-
tical TCES system design requires a balance between technical feasibility
and  techno-economic considerations. The durability of reactive  mate-
rials and reactor components faces challenges such as impurity, sinter-
ing,  and
"channeling,"  affecting  cyclic  behaviors.  Addressing
contamination  issues,  including  quartz  window,  reactor  wall,  and
insulation materials, is critical for safe reactor operation.

Finally, the difficulties associated with upscaling TCES reactors and
their integration with the power block have been examined. The main
challenges in TCES research and technology development include the
exploration of innovative chemistry and reactive materials, integration
of  CSP  or  other  renewable  energy  for  high-temperature  charging,
development of reliable and durable reactor materials of construction,
and demonstration of feasible reactor design and scale up. TCES tech-
nology is very promising to impact the transition to a net-zero energy
future. We envision growing  interest, research  endeavors, and invest-
ment from various sectors in TCES reactor development in the decades
to come.
