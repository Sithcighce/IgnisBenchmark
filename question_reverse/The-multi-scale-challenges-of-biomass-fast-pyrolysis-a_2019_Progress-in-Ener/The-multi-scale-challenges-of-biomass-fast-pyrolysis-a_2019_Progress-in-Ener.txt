Biomass fast pyrolysis is potentially one of the cheapest routes toward renewable liquid fuels. Its commer-
cialization, however, poses a multi-scale challenge, which starts with the characterization of feedstock,
products and reaction intermediates at molecular scales, and continues with understanding the complex
reaction network taking place in different reactor configurations, and in the case of catalytic pyrolysis and
upgrading on different catalysts. In addition, crude pyrolysis oil is not immediately usable in the current
energy infrastructure, due to undesirable properties such as low energy content and corrosiveness as a
result of its high oxygenate content. It, therefore, needs to be upgraded and fractionated to desired spec-
ifications. While various types of pyrolysis reactors and upgrading technologies are under development,
knowledge transfer and closing the gap between theory and application requires model development. In-
depth understanding of the reaction mechanisms and kinetics should be combined with the knowledge of
multi-scale transport phenomena to enable design, optimization, and control of complex pyrolysis reac-
tors. Finally, underpinning economic and environmental impacts of biofuel production requires expanding
the system boundaries to include the overall process and supply chain. The present contribution aims at
providing a comprehensive multi-scale review that discusses the state of the art of each of these aspects,
as well as their multi-scale interactions. The study is mainly focused on fast pyrolysis, although reference
to other types of pyrolysis technologies is made for the sake of comparison and knowledge transfer.

Biomass-derived fuels have the potential of diversifying energy
resources. The International Energy Agency forecasts that in 2050,
27% of the global transport fuel can be sustainably supplied from
biomass and waste resources [1] . Amongst various biomass con-
version technologies, pyrolysis has been used to produce biochar
for thousands of years. However, only in the last few decades, the
application of pyrolysis to produce liquid fuels has gained indus-
trial interest. Fast pyrolysis (also known as flash pyrolysis) refers
to a process in which biomass particles undergo thermal degrada-
tion in the absence of oxygen. Typical operating conditions include
moderate  temperature  (450–600 °C)  and  short  residence  time  of
less than 2 s [2] . The products of biomass pyrolysis are char, non-
condensable gases such as carbon oxides and methane, in addition
to a condensable phase consisting mostly of oxygenates and wa-
ter. The condensable phase forms a brownish viscous liquid that
is often referred to as pyrolysis oil or simply bio-oil. The yield of
bio-oil can be as high as 75% on a mass dry basis [2] . In compari-
son with other biofuel technologies, biomass fast pyrolysis offers
a  cost-efficient  route  to  liquid  fuels.  The  pyrolysis  technology  is
highly flexible and can process a wide range of feedstock including
forest residue, food waste, tire waste, and municipal solid wastes
(MSWs).

Despite  significant  economic  potential  and  a  high  degree  of
flexibility, producing renewable liquid fuels via biomass pyrolysis
poses  a  multi-scale  challenge.  First  of  all,  biomass  resources  are
highly diverse, and characterization of their components is chal-
lenging. The second challenge is the abundance of different species
in the product stream; in which all the components are not de-
tectable by common characterization tools, and may have a short
lifetime.  Nonetheless,  pyrolysis  oil  is  highly  reactive  and  certain
compounds  undergo  aging  reactions  even  at  room  temperature.
Additionally, due to the variable nature of feedstock, very different
pretreatment strategies may be required to maximize the yield of
product slots. Product yield and composition can also vary signif-
icantly at different operating conditions. In addition, bio-oil is not
immediately usable by energy consumers as it is highly viscous,
immiscible  with  petroleum  fuels  [2] ,  chemically  unstable  due  to
the presence of oxygenates, and low in energy content. The crude
bio-oil should be, therefore, upgraded using a variety of upgrading
technologies to become compatible with the current energy infras-
tructure. As a result, the pyrolysis science and engineering are in-
herently multi-scale and multidisciplinary.

The  roadmap  of  this  paper  is  shown  in  Fig.  1.1  which  illus-
trates the multi-scale characteristics of the problem spanning over
a  wide  range  of  temporal  and  spatial  scales  that  require  a  di-
verse portfolio of scientific and engineering knowledge. Our jour-
ney starts at the molecular level (Node 1) by investigating the in-
teractions between reactant molecules and the catalyst (in the case
of catalytic pyrolysis). This is carried out using advanced analytical
methods that characterize feed and products to understand poten-
tial reaction pathways and optimal process configurations. An im-
mediate benefit of high-resolution characterization is the design of
more efficient catalysts. Catalysts can influence the reaction path-
ways and greatly influence the energy requirements as well as the
quality and the yield of products (Node 2). Kinetics models val-
idated  with  experimental  data  are  then  used  to  model  different
unit operations, mainly reactors (Node 3). The next step is to de-
sign and investigate upgrading and separation technologies (Node
4),  to  ensure  that  the  fuel  physical  and  thermal  properties  are
commensurate with the current energy infrastructure. Process in-
tegration, waste commercial viability, and environmental footprint
(Node  5)  are  then  investigated  as  well  as  supply-chain  manage-
ment (Node 6) in order to quantify the key performance indica-

tors of the pyrolysis process. In conclusion, advanced development
of pyrolysis and upgrading technologies require a variety of strate-
gic, tactical, and operational decisions at various special and tem-
poral scales and optimizing the overall network profitability and
sustainability.

2. Conceptual design

Conceptual process design is inherently a multi-scale paradigm
and  captures  all  the  constituents  of  pyrolysis  technologies  and
their interactions all through the temporal and spatial scales from
pretreatment to the pyrolysis reactor, followed by upgrading and
separation of products. Fig. 2.1 presents the graphical superstruc-
ture of the process and provides the roadmap for this section. Ac-
cording to Fig. 2.1 , a pyrolysis process is mainly comprised of three
main  stages:  (1)  feedstock  reception,  storage,  handling,  prepara-
tion, and pretreatment; (2) pyrolysis conversion, consisting of ini-
tial moisture evaporation and primary decomposition followed by
secondary reactions ( e.g. oil cracking and repolymerization [3,4] );
and (3) upgrading and refining the reactor effluents to marketable
products [2] . This section provides an overview of various pyrolysis
stages and process configurations.

In  addition,  Table  2.1  gives  a  representative list  of  the  pyrol-
ysis  technologies  including  details  of  the  pretreatment,  reaction,
and bio-oil upgrading sections. In this section, first different types
of biomass feedstock used are explained followed by an in-depth
overview of different pre-treatment, reaction, and upgrading tech-
nologies. As summarized in Table 2.1 , recent process design and
modeling research have focused on the centralized fast pyrolysis,
with an emphasis on the fluidized bed pyrolysis due to its reliable
and well-established performance. Although small portable pyroly-
sis reactors with low capacity ( e.g. a feeding rate of 50 metric tons
of  biomass  per  day  or  less)  are  under  commercial  development
[5,6] , mobile distributed fast pyrolysis facilities have been consid-
ered in only a few studies [6,7] .

2.1. Feedstock

An  important  characteristic  of  pyrolysis  technologies  is  their
adaptability  and  flexibility  to  accept  a  diverse  array  of  raw
materials.  The  feedstocks  include  first-generation  (1G)  food
crops,  second-generation  (2G)  lignocellulosic  biomass,  and  third-
generation (3G) algae and various wastes, as shown in Fig. 2.1 and
discussed in the following sub-sections.

2.1.1. Terrestrial biomass

Fast pyrolysis of 1G and 2G terrestrial biomass (especially the
lignocellulosic feedstock from 1G food crop residues and 2G non-
food woody biomass) has been widely investigated. A wide range
of factors such as feedstock species, form of the biomass ( e.g. bark,
sawdust, and other residues), biomass age, storage conditions, and
feedstock composition ( e.g. moisture content, cellulose-lignin com-
position,  nitrogen  content,  and  alkali  and  alkaline  earth  metal-
lic (AAEM) components) which affect the pyrolysis reactions and
products [8,9] were studied. Different 2G feedstocks produce hun-
dreds of compounds in a series of complex reactions which in turn
results  in  different  yields  and  physicochemical  properties  of  py-
rolysis bio-crude [10] . Cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin are the
main constituents of the 2G biomass. Zhang et al. [11] isolated cel-
lulose from pine wood, Poplar wood, and wheat straw and stud-
ied their pyrolysis characteristics. Due to the D-glucose subunits
arranged in the crystalline structure of microfibrils, cellulose is rel-
atively resistant to thermal decomposition. Therefore, the feedstock

with high cellulose content would require high pyrolysis temper-
atures [12] . Due to the complex and interconnected linkages be-
tween  p-hydroxyphenyl,  syringyl  and  guaiacyl  units  [13] ,  lignin
shows  even  higher  thermal  stability  [14] .  Hemicellulose  is  the
least thermally stable component in lignocellulosic biomass [15] .
Cellulose and hemicellulose (represented by xylan) decompose at
the temperature ranges of 315–400 °C and 220–315 °C, respectively
[16,17] , compared to a wider and higher temperature range (160–
900 °C)  for  lignin,  with  the  highest  biochar  yield  around  500 °C
[8] . In general, 2G biomasses with higher moisture content feature
more liquid production and lower gas and solid yields [18,19] while
2G feedstock with high nitrogen content favors both gas and bio-
oil generation [8] . AAEMs present in the biomass impact pyrolysis
pathways significantly, reducing bio-oil yield and quality, while in-
creasing biochar generation [20,21] .

2.1.2. Aqueous biomass

Pyrolysis  technologies  developed  for  lignocellulosic  ( i.e.  2G)
biomass  may  directly  be  applied  to  3G  algae  biomass.  In  recent
years, dried algae as a promising pyrolysis feedstock has gained in-
creasing research attention. The processing technologies proposed
by researchers include non-catalytic pyrolysis or catalytic pyroly-
sis systems with microwave or fixed-bed reactors [36–41] . An algal
cell is composed of a mixture of three different compounds groups
(lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins) which can be converted into
a range of bioproducts via various pyrolysis reactions. In contrast
to lignin which does not favor pyrolysis oil production [42] , the
biomass extractives containing protein and starch can enhance bio-
oil yield and quality [43] . The experimental analysis conducted by
Wang [44] on pyrolysis of protein- and lipid-rich feedstock sug-
gested that microalgae can potentially deliver high bio-oil yields.
This was also confirmed by Trinh et al. [41] , who concluded that
microalgae pyrolysis can achieve significantly higher energy recov-
ery in terms of bio-oil (76%) compared with lignocellulosic biomass
(45%).  Protein-rich  microalgae  can  also  lead  to  superior  pyroly-
sis oil quality (lower oxygen content and higher calorific values)
than with lignin-rich 2G biomass [41,44] . Other desirable proper-
ties of algal strains in comparison with terrestrial plants include
high resource-utilization efficiency, high CO
2 sequestration capac-
ity,  tolerance  to  a  wide  range  of  conditions  and  seasonal  varia-
tions, rapid production cycles, and high photosynthesis efficiency
[45] . Desirable features such as CO
2 utilization, bioremediation po-
tential  by  recovering  nutrient  resources  from  wastewater,  higher
energy  yield  per  unit  land  than  terrestrial  crops,  in  addition  to
the avoidance of competition with human food resources favor al-
gae as a competitive carbon-containing feedstock for fast pyrolysis
[46–51] .

2.1.3. Waste

Various waste streams can also be used as the feedstock for py-
rolysis, including industrial waste ( e.g. tires, packaging, and recy-
clable waste), municipal solid waste (MSW), sewage sludge, agri-
cultural  waste  ( e.g.  livestock  manure,  or  agricultural  residues),
pre-treated non-hazardous waste fractions such as refuse-derived
fuel  (RDF),  solid  refuse  fuels  (SRF),  and  some  hazardous  waste
(such as automotive shredder residue). Pyrolysis technologies ex-
hibit substantial flexibility to recover energy and carbon resources
embedded  in  these  waste  materials  regardless  of  their  calorific
values  ( Table  2.2 )  and  carbon  origin  (biogenic  or  fossil-based)
[52] .  The  pyrolysis  performance  and  reactor  design  of  various
waste  streams  including  biogenic  carbon  wastes  such  as  paper
[53] , green waste, food waste [54] , fossil-derived wastes e.g. plas-
tics  [55] ,  tires  [56,57] ,  and  mixed  fossil-biogenic  wastes  includ-
ing  RDF  [58,59]  and  MSW  [60–64]  have  been  extensively  in-
vestigated in the  recent two  decades. Such  waste-based systems
could  contribute  to  the  paradigm  shift  from  waste  disposal  to

2.2. Process configurations

Fig. 2.1 suggests that pyrolysis technologies are highly adapt-
able to various feedstocks. Pretreatment technologies enable opti-
mization of product yield and composition, and minimization of
undesirable by-products. The pyrolysis reactions can be promoted
catalytically or non-catalytically. The former is also referred to as
in-situ  catalytic  pyrolysis.  In  the  non-catalytic  configuration,  the
primary pyrolysis vapors may be immediately upgraded in a cat-
alytic  reactor  (known  as  ex-situ  catalytic  pyrolysis)  or  are  firstly
condensed  and  phase-separated,  and  then  the  liquid  phase  un-
dergoes  upgrading  processes.  Several  comprehensive  reviews  are
available covering pyrolysis mechanisms, reactor types and perfor-
mance, process parameters, conversion pathways, product proper-
ties, and yields [3,76–80] . In general, fluidized bed reactors incur
higher  capital  and  operational  costs  but  are  regarded  as  a  suit-
able technology for large-scale pyrolysis including catalytic pyroly-
sis. Entrained flow reactors are expected to be more economically
efficient but deliver lower carbon efficiency than fluidized bed sys-
tems.  Ablative  reactors  and  auger  reactors  are  considered  to  be
suitable  for  small-scale  operations  and  distributed  systems  [24] .
Other types of reactors in development include microwave-assisted
reactors [81] , and solar reactors [82] . The details of these technolo-
gies are reviewed in Section 2.2.2 . The optimum operational pa-
rameters ( e.g. particle size, reaction pressure, carrier gas, tempera-
ture, heating rate, and vapor residence time) for different types of
pyrolysis reactors vary significantly. The system performance un-
der various process configurations can be projected using process
simulation models.

To avoid secondary vapor cracking, the char formed from pyrol-
ysis reactor is separated straight away via char removal cyclones,
which are followed by vapor quenching [8] . Although fast pyrol-
ysis  oil  has  a  high  heating  value  of  around  17 MJ/kg,  it  is  high
in  oxygen,  moisture  content,  and  viscosity  [2,83] ,  and  contains
corrosive and thermally unstable substances. Thus, it is upgraded
using  chemical  or  physical  methods  so  that  a  final  oil  with  an
elevated  H  to  C  ratio  [84,85]  and  lower  oxygenated  compounds
can be acheived. Chemical upgrading includes catalytic esterifica-
tion, hydrothermal liquefaction, hydrodeoxygenation, or other cat-
alytic hydroprocessing (see Section 2.2.4.2 ), whereas physical up-
grading  involves  hot  vapor  filtration,  solvent  addition,  or  extrac-
tion of organic acids [86] . Catalysts play a significant role in py-
rolysis  oil  upgrading  by  triggering  or  enhancing  a  range  of  re-
actions including cracking, carbonylation, decarboxylation, hydro-
cracking, hydrodeoxygenation, and hydrogenation. As pointed out
in Sections 3.1.1.8 and 3.3.2 , upgrading using multi-functional cat-
alysts is believed to drive future pyrolysis development as this of-
fers flexible processing of different bio-oils produced from different
feedstocks and in different reactor configurations [85] .

2.2.1. Pretreatment technologies

Pretreatment  is  necessary  for  obtaining  desirable  pyrolysis
products [63] , and a variety of pretreatment methods prior to fast
pyrolysis have been developed [74] , including water leaching [87–
89] , dilute acid and alkali pretreatment [90–92] , bio-oil washing
[21] , thermal pretreatment (including torrefaction and hydrother-
mal pretreatment) [93–95] , and combined pretreatment (such as
two-step acid-demineralization and torrefaction [96] ). Water leach-
ing  removes  water-soluble  alkali  and  alkaline  species  as  well  as
undesirable inorganics ( e.g. K, Cl, and S) [87,97,98] . However, due
to organically-bound components, water-solution fractions only ac-
count for a certain percentage of metallic species [99,100] . More
AAEMs can be, therefore, removed [21,101] by contacting the aque-
ous phase of bio-oil which is a homogeneous mixture of water and
organic matters including acetic acid [102] with biomass as these
organically-bound components are acid-soluble. Such bio-oil wash-
ing treatment results in increased bio-oil and levoglucosan yields
[103] .

Using  similar  approach,  the  acid  pre-hydrolysis  method
[104]  proposed in  the 1980s,  uses dilute hydrochloric,  sul-
furic,  hydrofluoric,  perchloric,  or  nitric  acid  to  demineral-
ize  2 G  feedstock,  particularly  AAEM-rich  agricultural  waste
[89,92,105,106] , and other AAEM-containing biomass [99] . Detailed
studies [89,107] suggested that acid demineralization was more ef-
fective for 2G feedstock pretreatment than alkali or steam explo-
sion, but could be expensive and introduce undesirable elements
(such  as  S,  N,  and  Cl)  from  inorganic  acids  into  the  pretreated
biomass.

2 O, CO

Thermal  pretreatment  has  been  the  focus  of  recent  studies
[108] .  Torrefaction,  a  mild  pyrolysis  process  applied  for  biomass
densification  occurring  at  200 −350 °C  in  the  absence  of  oxygen,
has been regarded as an effective and advantageous pretreatment,
benefiting  from  low  energy  inputs  and  effective  oxygen  removal
[91,94] .  Torrefaction  was  found  not  only  to  cause  biomass  phys-
ical  changes  but  also  to  bring  about  chemical  structural  trans-
formations  such  as  hemicellulose  degradation  and  lignin  macro-
molecule changes [15] . By increasing biomass grindability and en-
ergy content, selectively decomposing hemicellulose fractions, low-
ering biomass acidity and losing H
2, and CO, torrefaction has
been reported to enhance the crude bio-oil yield, particularly aro-
matics’ yields (due to relatively higher aromatic yields from cel-
lulose and lignin) and to reduce the bio-oil oxygen content [109–
112] . Hydrothermal pretreatment (also referred to as “wet torrefac-
tion”) using compressed hot water or other hydrothermal media, is
another emerging technology for fractionating biomass [93,113,114] ,
pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass (removing the need for the
energy-intensive biomass drying stage [115] ), liquefaction of ligno-
cellulosic and aquatic biomass (by enzymatic hydrolysis [116–118] ),
or upgrading of pyrolysis oil. The hydrothermal pretreatment pro-
cess is conducted at saturated vapor pressure in the temperature
range  of  180–260 °C  [93,119] .  Under  supercritical  conditions,  wa-
ter undergoes enhancement in its properties (density, ionic prod-
uct and dielectric constant), causing it to behave like an organic
solvent with acidic/basic catalytic properties which is ideal for the
conversion of biomass macromolecules to simpler components via
depolymerization and decomposition reactions [31,120,121] . Alter-
natively,  aqueous  processing  can  be  conducted  on  the  biomass
directly.  Aqueous  processing  hydrates  cellulose,  and  depolymer-
izes hemicellulose, resulting in 40–60% solubility of lignocellulosic
materials  in  water  [122] .  The  underlying  reactions,  also  known
as  hydrothermal  liquefaction,  hydrothermolysis,  or  the  aquasolve
[122]  process  are  conducted  at  temperatures  lower  than  pyroly-
sis (approximately 300 °C) but significantly higher pressures (ap-
proximately 20 MPa) and longer vapor residence times for bio-oil
(20–60 min). The product of biomass liquefaction has a lower oxy-
gen (12–14%) and water (3–5%) content compared to pyrolysis oil

[123] . However,  lower  bio-oil yields  (25–35%) [115] compared to
biomass  pyrolysis  (55–75%)  [2]  are  observed.  Often  stirred  tank
reactors  are  used  in  hydrothermal  treatment  to  avoid  precipita-
tion and blockage. In comparison with torrefaction, hydrothermal
pretreatment  shows  better  performance  in  terms  of  carbon-rich
solid fuel production and inorganic metallic compound reduction
[119,124] .  By  effectively  solubilizing  hemicellulose  into  aqueous
compounds, retaining cellulose in the solid phase, and decreasing
the formation of water, acids, and reactive compounds, hydrother-
mal pretreatment has been reported to improve the pyrolysis oil
quality produced from 2G biomass [93] . However, both torrefaction
and hydrothermal pretreatments have been less investigated in the
literature, and their effects on feedstock structure and pyrolysis re-
action pathways have not yet fully understood [15,93] .

Although attempts have been made to apply torrefaction pre-
treatment for waste streams such as dry agricultural waste [106] ,
paper  sludge  [91] ,  and  sewage  sludge  [125] ,  the  main  focus  has
been on clean 2G feedstocks due to the technical challenges related
to  air  emissions,  product  quality  control,  and  feedstock  quality
variations [119] . On the contrary, hydrothermal processes eliminate
an energy-intensive feedstock-drying step and thus are considered
a  promising  technology  for  a  wider  range  of  feedstock  such  as
sewage sludge and wet agricultural waste [119,120] . Table 2.1 sug-
gests that although pretreatment technologies have been studied
empirically,  there  are  still  some  gaps  in  better  understanding  of
these technologies and their process designs.

2.2.2. Reactor technologies

Pyrolysis reactors typically account for only 10–25% of the to-
tal  capital  cost.  However,  the  reactor  design  and  operation  pro-
foundly influence the overall yield, process configuration, and en-
ergy requirements. Table 2.3 summarizes various commercial and
development  reaction  technologies,  which  vary  from  circulating
fluidized  bed  to  rotating  cone,  ablative  pyrolysis,  auger  reactors,
and microwave-assisted reactors. These designs differ significantly
in the method they employ for heat transfer, and their capabilities
for solid removal, liquid collection, and scale-up. As elaborated in
subsequent sections, the pyrolysis reactions are highly constrained
by  the  transport  phenomena  [126] .  In  particular,  amongst  vari-
ous design considerations, heat transfer poses the most significant
challenge. The pyrolysis reactions are inherently endothermic and
therefore higher heating rate, grinding biomass into finer particles
( e.g. 2–3 mm), and reducing the water content ( e.g. below 10%) all
result in higher bio-oil yield. The required energy can be supplied
by  a  carrier  gas,  from  reactor  surfaces,  through  transported  bed
materials  ( e.g.  sand),  or  through  partial  combustion  by  adding  a
small amount of air. The requirement for carrier gas significantly
affects the equipment size and the scaling up potential. In addition,
moving mechanical parts at elevated temperatures and feed entry
from the bottom (in the case of circulating fluidized bed (CFB) re-
actors)  adds  to  the  design  complexities.  The  method  of  biomass
delivery ( i.e. fluidization, centrifugal force, or mechanical driving)
also affects the residence time distribution of gases. Particle size
reduction  is  often  necessary,  as  excessive  heating  and  formation
of local hotspots would reduce product yields. The main pyrolysis
reactors and their corresponding features are further discussed in
Sections 2.2.2.1 –2.2.2.9 .

2.2.2.1. Bubbling  fluidized  bed  (BFB)  reactors.  Bubbling  fluidized
bed reactors, promoted mainly by Dynamotive [127] , have found
widespread application, due to their simplicity and ease of process
control. The bed media, often sand, is supported on a perforated
plate and is fluidized using an inert gas flowing upward from the
reactor bottom. High bio-oil yields (70–75%) [2] are achievable in
this type of reactor. The velocity of the fluidizing gas and its aero-
dynamics impose constraints on the reactor height-to-diameter ra-

500 °C [139] , albeit at poor heat transfer between gas and biomass
particles which results in large gas flow rates and limited scale-up
potential.

2.2.2.2. Circulating fluidized bed (CFB) reactors.  Circulating fluidized
bed  reactors  are  in  principle  bubbling  fluidized  bed  reactors  in
which a carrier gas stream transports the bed media, often sand
(with a sand/feed ratio of 20–25 [13] ), into and from the reactor.
The  char  and  sand  are  separated  from  the  pyrolysis  products  in
the downstream cyclone and sent to a combustor, burning unre-
acted particles [30] , thus enabling an energy-efficient heat supply
for the endothermic pyrolysis reactions, and easing the constraints
on the scale-up of CFB reactors. Char and sand have a smaller resi-
dence time (0.5–1 s) in CFB reactor compared to BFB reactor, which
requires smaller particle size (due to a higher residence time of
about 2–3 s). Fig. 2.2 presents three CFB reactor configurations. In
the left and right configurations, the biomass feed enters the re-
actor from the bottom; while in the middle configuration, it is fed
from the top, minimizing the required carrier gas. The main com-
mercialized CFB reactors include Ensyn Inc.’s Rapid Thermal Pro-
cessing (RTP) [127,128] , ENEL’s dual-reactor system in which py-
rolysis is carried out in the first reactor and the produced char is
combusted in the second reactor to heat up the sand and recycle
it back to the first reactor [130] , as well as reactors developed by
CRES and CPERI [13] .

2.2.2.3. Entrained  flow  reactors.  Entrained  flow  reactors  are  in-
spired by the gasification technologies, in which biomass particles
are entrained by a preheated inert gas stream [133] . These produce
about 50% bio-oil and 20–30% char at a reactor exit temperature of

2.2.2.4. Ablative reactors.  In ablative reactors, the heat transfer is
achieved by forcing the biomass against a hot plate ( e.g. reactor
wall), as it undergoes pyrolysis reactions. This is in analogy with
“melting butter in a frying pan” [2] . As an example, in an ablative
vortex reactor, developed by the National Renewable Energy Lab-
oratory (NREL), the biomass particles are carried by superheated
steam or inert gas at a speed of 200 m/s and are fed tangentially
to the reactor wall at 625 °C. The centrifugal forces of the gas slide
the particles on the reactor wall in a helical pattern. As the wood
is carried away, the “molten wood” evaporates. A high heat trans-
fer rate of 10 0 0 W/cm 2 was reported. A large particle size (20 mm
compared to 2 mm in BFB reactors) was used efficiently [130] . Up
to 70% bio-oil yield was achieved [140] . The limitation of vortex
ablative reactors is that the high-velocity biomass particles enter-
ing tangentially into the reactor cause erosion during their tran-
sition from linear to angular trajectories. The required high veloc-
ity also imposes some uncertainty on the scale up. Ablative vortex
technology was abandoned in 1997 [130] .

A  parallel  concept  for  ablative  reactors  was  developed  at  As-
ton University, in which biomass particles are scraped along the
reactor wall using rotating blades [141] . A bio-oil yield of 62% was
reported [129] . An advantage of the Aston ablative pyrolysis tech-
nology  is  that  the  carrier  gas  is  no  longer required, resulting  in
high-quality gas products. In addition, the rates of reactions are no
longer limited by the heat transfer rate. As a result, significantly

larger biomass particles can be used. The liquid product of abla-
tive  pyrolysis  also  features  significantly  lower  molecular  weights
(MWs) due to cracking and depolymerization on the surface of the
reactor which is deposited by char [76,142] . This comes at the price
of producing microcarbons that are difficult to separate and end up
in the bio-oil [76] . An example of the ablative reactor is shown in
Fig. 2.3 .

2.2.2.5. Vacuum  pyrolysis  reactors.  Vacuum  pyrolysis  reactors
[134]  reduce the  residence time of vapors,  thus limiting the
secondary  reactions.  Although  the  liquid  product  under  vacuum
conditions has a composition similar to conventional bio-oil, the
rate  of  heat  transfer  (or  heating  efficiency)  and  thus  the  liquid
yields  are  low  (35–50%  [144] ).  Generally,  vacuum  pyrolysis  is
highly  complex  and  involves  moving  parts  at  high  temperatures
( e.g. 500 °C). In addition, operating at vacuum conditions requires
special  techniques  for  feeding  solids  and  discharging  products.
However, vacuum pyrolyzers produce high-quality oil with no char,
eliminating the need for  hot filtration.  The absence of  sweeping
gas  minimizes  aerosol  formation.  The  lignin-derived  fraction  of
bio-oil has also a lower molecular weight compared to fluidized
bed reactors. In addition, larger biomass particles (2–5 cm) can be
used, reducing the energy requirement for biomass grinding [130] .

2.2.2.6. Rotating cone reactors.  Similar to CFB reactors, a mixture
of  sand  and  biomass  particles  is  used  in  rotating  cone  reactors
( Fig. 2.4 ) as the reaction medium. Centrifugal forces in a rotating
cone are used to drive the particles, eliminating the need for a car-
rier gas [132] . The biomass and sand particles are introduced from
the bottom of the cone. As the biomass particles travel upward to
the lip of the cone, they undergo pyrolysis reactions. The sand and
char are then sent to the combustor and the vapors are condensed
for extracting bio-oil. Up to 70% yield was reported [132] . The lim-
itations of this reactor include the relatively complex configuration
of a rotating cone, pneumatic conveyance of sand, and the difficult
control of the bubble bed char combustor [130] .

2.2.2.7. Auger kilns and screw reactors.  A screw pyrolysis reactor is
shown in Fig. 2.5 . These reactors apply mechanical drives to trans-
port the biomass. They share similar principles with ablative re-
actors regarding transferring the heat from reactor walls, but the
biomass may also be mixed with preheated metal or ceramic balls
or sand. The residence time of particles and produced gases is sig-
nificantly more than CFB reactors and is in the range of 5–30 s.
Due to longer residence time, lower bio-oil yields can be achieved,
with a tendency for phase separation due to longer contact with
char [2] . Auger kiln reactors have the advantage of being compact
equipment and are favorable for mobile pyrolyzers [24,139] .

2.2.2.8. Microwave-assisted  reactors.  Microwave-assisted  pyrolysis
is an emerging technology which exploits the microwave dielectric
heating effect. It has the advantages of efficient and fast “in-core”
heat-transfer. In fact, the temperature gradient of the microwave-
assisted pyrolysis is the inverse of that in conventional technolo-
gies. Biomass and waste feedstock are, in principle, poor heat ab-
sorbing  materials.  The  existence  of  moisture  to  a  certain  extent
and pretreatment using acids and ionic liquids can be used to im-
prove  this  technique  [81] .  The  microwave-assisted  reactors  have
the disadvantage of forming hotspots which may adversely affect
the  yield  and  quality  of  bio-oil.  In  addition,  microwave  penetra-
tion  is  limited  to  1–2 cm  posing  a  scale-up  challenge  [2] .  How-
ever, some strict specifications on the size and the moisture con-
tent of biomass particles are relaxed in this technique compared to
other technologies. The control of microwave pyrolysis also poses
another interesting scale-up challenge as slow heating rates favor
char formation and fast heating rates favor gasification [145] . There
is an optimal point where the bio-oil yield should be optimized.

2.2.2.9. Hydropyrolysis  reactors.  Hydropyrolysis  is  a  new  technol-
ogy in which pyrolysis is conducted under a hydrogen-rich atmo-
sphere and is often boosted by the presence of hydrotreating cat-
alyst. It is, in principle, the integration between pyrolysis and hy-
drodeoxygenation, and a good example of process intensification.
It was originally developed for coal pyrolysis [146,147] and is cur-
rently under investigation for biomass pyrolysis [136] . The primary
products of fast hydropyrolysis are aromatics. However, if the py-
rolysis reactor is followed by an ex-situ hydrotreater, it is possi-
ble  to  optimize  the  product  toward  alkanes  and  naphthenic  hy-
drocarbons  [136] .  This  technology  is  discussed  in  more  detail  in
Section 2.2.4 .

2.2.2.10. Other emerging reactors.  There are a variety of emerging
pyrolysis technologies which are under investigation. For instance,
concentrated solar energy can be a strong source of heat for the
endothermic  pyrolysis  reactions  and  can  reduce  the  greenhouse
gas  footprint  of  the  ultimate  fuel.  Both  solar  furnaces  and  solar

simulators have been used for experimental and modeling stud-
ies, including both biomass pyrolysis and gasification [148] . Rony
et al. [149] applied a solar simulator to study  biomass pyrolysis
using direct concentrated radiation. They identified 750 °C as the
optimal temperature and observed an improvement in the produc-
tion of phenolic compounds. Similarly, Morales et al. [150] studied
the application of solar energy for the pyrolysis of orange peel and
reported  high-value  products  in  the  pyrolysis  oil.  An  alternative
method for high heating rate required for fast pyrolysis is through
electric current. Honma et al. [151] studied pulse current-heating
of biomass pyrolysis. They reported enhanced production of pol-
yaromatic  hydrocarbons  under  catalytic  conditions.  Zhang  et  al.
[152,153] studied the so-called internally connected fluidized beds
(ICFB) in which a combustion bed is used for energy recovery from
coke  by-products.  They  demonstrated  that  spouting  and  fluidiz-
ing gas flow rates could be applied efficiently to control the solid
circulation rate and bed height as the most important operating
variables in the reactor hydrodynamics [152] . They reported that
catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) of rice stalk can produce up to 20%
petrochemicals  [153] .  Finally,  special  reactors  are  applied  to  de-
velop kinetic models. For instance, Hoekstra [154] applied a wire-
mesh reactor to study the decomposition of pinewood and model
compounds. The advantage of this reactor was the suppression of
vapor-phase  reactions  using  liquid  nitrogen,  enabling  analysis  of
liquid and char products.

2.2.3. Oil quenching and char separation

Quenching the hot pyrolysis products is essential for suppress-
ing the secondary reactions and maintaining a high product yield.
Indirect  heating  can  potentially  result  in  deposition  of  lignin-
derived  products  and  blockage  of  process  equipment.  Quenching
with a cooled bio-oil product or other inert hydrocarbons is often
the method of choice, as demonstrated in Fig. 2.6 .

For a self-sustaining process design, the energy content of char
and  gas  should  be  exploited.  The  gaseous  and  char  by-products
contain 5% and 25% of the initial biomass energy content, respec-
tively. 60–75% of char energy content is needed for the heat re-
quired for pyrolysis reactions. In addition to an economic incentive
for energy saving, char acts as a catalyst for secondary reactions
( e.g. vapor cracking and bio-oil polymerization), is pyrophoric and
combusts spontaneously in the presence of air. The char should be
therefore removed as soon as it is produced. Char removal poses
important  challenges,  as  it  contains  alkali  metals  such  as  potas-

sium and sodium (which are constituents of the original biomass).
The circulation of the alkali metal present in the char can be con-
trolled  by  char  gasification  before  combustion  and  circulation  of
hot gases, with the excess heat used for biomass drying. Most of
the char particles have a size similar to the biomass feed. These
can be removed by hot vapor filtration technologies which are cur-
rently under development. Fine char particles are also entrained
in the vapors and end up in the bio-oil product. These can be re-
moved by high-pressure liquid filtration although this is suscepti-
ble to filter blockage. An alternative is solvent addition; which is
discussed in Section 2.2.4.1 . Additionally, aerosol by-products are
often formed that are essentially incomplete depolymerized liquid
particles derived from lignin constituents of the biomass. A demis-
ter and coalescer can partially collect these by-products and miti-
gate the problem [2] .

Biochar not only can be used as fuel onsite, but also is a po-
tential  end-product  [155–157]  for  example for soil enhancement
and construction materials, thus reducing CO
2  emitted to the at-
mosphere [156] , in fuel cells [158] , as a catalyst for syngas clean-
ing, esterification, or Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) [159–161] , and
as  a  storage  material  for  hydrogen  and  CO
2  [162–164]  remedia-
tion [165] . The physical properties (elemental composition, surface
functional groups, stability, porosity, and surface area) of biochar
as an end-product can be tuned by pyrolysis temperature and res-
idence time [156] , as well as feedstock type. Short vapor residence
time with a high heating rate of 100–1000 °C/s favor thermal crack-
ing and reduce char formation [13] . Nutshell feedstock also pro-
duces  a  biochar  with  a  higher  surface  area  than  rice  straw  and
wheat straw [166] .

2.2.4. Upgrading technologies

The pyrolysis oil, also known as bio-oil, requires upgrading and
fine-tuning  so  that  the  product  specifications  are  commensurate
with existing transportation infrastructures. The upgrading meth-
ods  aim  at  stabilizing  the  crude  bio-oil  by  removing  its  oxygen
content and reducing its viscosity, aging potential, and solid con-
tent.  They  can  be  broadly  classified  into  physical  and  chemical
upgrading technologies and are discussed in Sections 2.2.4.1 and
2.2.4.2 .

2.2.4.1. Physical upgrading.  The key physical methods for improv-
ing  the  bio-oil  quality  are  solvent  addition,  emulsification,  and
filtration.  Addition  of  polar  solvents  such  as  methanol  [167]  or

ethanol modifies the liquid microstructure by dissolving the less
soluble components, which in turn, stabilizes the aging process. It
also results in homogenization and reduction of bio-oil viscosity.
Emulsification is achieved by adding diesel to the oil. Hot vapor
filtration can significantly reduce the ash and char content which
otherwise would catalyze secondary reactions. Hot vapor filtration
would also decrease the fuel ignition delay and increase its burn-
ing rate.

2.2.4.2. Chemical upgrading.  The chemical methods for upgrading
pyrolysis oil are more diverse as discussed in Sections 2.2.4.2.1 –
2.2.4.2.6 .  Table  2.4  summarizes  the  commercialized  and  under-
development technologies. These technologies greatly vary with re-
spect to the severity of operating conditions, residence time, prod-
uct yield, the requirement for additional feedstock, and the down-
stream refining steps to produce marketable products.

Hydrodeoxygenation.  Hydrodeoxygenation  (HDO),  also  known
as hydrogenation or simply hydrotreatment, is the main technology
for upgrading pyrolysis oils. It was originally inspired by the anal-
ogous hydrodesulfurization (HDS) and hydrodenitrogenation (HDN)
used in petroleum refineries and in the conversion of coal to liq-
uid fuels [168] . A catalytic reaction of crude bio-oil with hydro-
gen can significantly reduce the oxygenates through the formation
of water. However, hydrotreatment does not appreciably alter the
boiling range and molecular distributions [169] . The involved reac-
tions include hydrogenation, hydrodeoxygenation, decarboxylation,
hydrogenolysis, hydrocracking, and dehydration. The optimal com-
bination of these reactions requires significantly higher pressures
( > 20 MPa) than pyrolysis itself but a slightly more moderate tem-
perature (400 °C). Some advantages of hydrodeoxygenation include
the enhancement of the fuel yield, and similar properties to naph-
tha so that it can be integrated into conventional refineries to ben-
efit from economy of scale and engineering know-how. However,
such  advantages  come  at  the  price  of  expensive  hydrogen  con-
sumption. In addition, carbon deposition and coke formation are
reported as major barriers. As a resolution, it is recommended to
first stabilize bio-oil through hydrogenation at a lower tempera-
ture, followed by more intense HDO at higher temperatures.

Zeolite  cracking.  Unlike  hydrotreatment,  (zeolite)  cracking
helps  the  oxygen  atoms  to  leave  bio-oil  as  CO
2 ,  reducing  the
molecular  weight  distribution  of  bio-oil  components.  This  elimi-
nates expensive hydrogen requirement but at the cost of reduced
fuel  yield.  An  alternative  is  to  conduct  cracking  in  the  presence
of  hydrogen  ( i.e.  hydrocracking).  (Hydro)cracking  is  often  carried
out at more severe conditions than hydrodeoxygenation, ( e.g. > 350
°C and 0.7–14 MPa) [169] and has a higher risk of coke formation
which can cause operational difficulties.

Hydrothermal treatment.  Recently, the application of hydrother-
mal  processing  using  (near)  critical  water  in  upgrading  pyroly-
sis  oil  has  been  investigated  [31,170,171] .  It  was  shown  that  hy-
drothermal upgrading (HTU) can deoxygenate up to 30% of the hy-
droxyl compounds in less than 30 min, making it a suitable tech-
nology for short residence-time first-stage bio-oil upgrading. More-
over, the aqueous-phase product is a suitable feedstock for hydro-
gen production [31] . Despite these advantages, the products of hy-
drothermal  treatment  suffer  from  very  high  viscosity  and  lower
water-insoluble product yield. Therefore, the application of organic
solvents including methanol, ethanol, butanol, acetone, propanol,
glycerol, etc. has been under scrutiny. A research challenge is to
identify solvents that can be economically applied at large scales
[169] .

Gasification.  The  crude  pyrolysis  oil  can  be  gasified,  through
entrained flow reactors, with the advantages of easier pressuriza-
tion of bio-oil (compared to solid biomass) and higher gas qual-
ity.  The  gasified  bio-oil  can  be  later  converted  to  synthetic  hy-
drocarbons  in  a  range  of  diesel,  gasoline,  kerosene  and  lique-
fied petroleum gases, through steam reforming and Fischer-Tropsch
(FTS)  reactions.  However,  the  fuel  yield  is  relatively  lower,  and
tar formation can happen which leads to equipment blockage and
other operational difficulties [172] .

Steam  reforming.  Steam  reforming  converts  bio-oil  to  syngas,
and  then  to  synthetic  fuel  through  FTS,  or  to  pure  hydrogen
through water gas shift. Hydrogen can be used in other upgrad-
ing technologies such as hydrodeoxygenation or hydrocracking, and
therefore many proposed upgrading configurations involve reform-
ing a fraction of bio-oil [25,31] or water-soluble bio-oil [31] . Steam

Hydrogen yield from steam reforming reduces with the amount
of oxygen in the bio-oil and increases with its hydrogen content. It
also depends strongly on the catalyst used [174] . Steam reforming
is carried out at much higher temperatures than other upgrading
pathways ( > 800 °C) [83] and carbon deposition (up to 15% of initial
carbon [175] ) on the catalyst is identified as its most challenging
aspect [174] . Both fluidized and fixed bed reactors have been ap-
plied successfully for bio-oil reforming, and the former was shown
to benefit from less coke formation. Addition of small amounts of
oxygen mitigates coke formation and provides autothermal condi-
tions for endothermic reforming reaction, although it reduces the
hydrogen yield as well. Alternatively, the steam to carbon ratio –
can be increased (to 7–9 [83] ) to mitigate coke formation, although
this also increases energy costs. A secondary cause of catalyst de-
activation is poisoning, although bio-oils have typically low sulfur
content. Still, if the produced syngas is sent to FTS, its sulfur con-
tent must be reduced to ppbv levels [174] by a priori sulfur re-
moval, or a sulfur-resistant FTS catalyst should be used [176–178] .
Esterification.  Oxygenates  with  carboxylic  functionalities  ( e.g.
formic,  acetic,  or  propionic  acids)  reduce  bio-oil  energy  content
and  make  it  corrosive  and  chemically  unstable.  Esterification  of
acidic compounds is introduced as a “simple treatment” that can
reduce acidity, water content, and viscosity of pyrolysis oil and can
enhance its chemical stability [84] . Introduction of organic solvents
such as methanol (by about 10%) is proved to enhance the pyroly-
sis oil stability (measured in terms of potential increase in viscos-
ity) by 10-fold, through two pathways:

(1) Formation of esters and acetals [84] :

R 1 C OOH + R 2 OH (cid:2) R 1 C OO R 2 + H 2 O.

(2) Reactions with carboxylic acids and aldehydes [84] :

R 1 CHO + 2 R 2 − OH (cid:2) R 1 CH ( O R 2 )

2 + H 2 O.

(2.2)

(2.3)

Since esterification via organic acid addition is constrained by
thermodynamic equilibrium, removal of water and/or ester is crit-
ical  for  deriving  the  reaction  forward.  A  proposed  resolution  is
reactive-adsorption  on  molecular  sieves.  Alternatively,  high  effi-
ciencies  can  be  achieved  using  semi-batch  reactive  distillation
which enables online product removal [179] . Another advantage of
reactive distillation is process intensification through merging re-
actor and separation units.

2.2.5. Future research directions

Overall, our literature review ( Fig. 2.1 and Table 2.1 ) suggests
a  significant  research  gap  in  process  systems  design  and  engi-
neering of emerging pyrolysis technologies. Process conceptual de-
sign lags behind the empirical research on pyrolysis. In fact, not
only  should  conceptual  design  advance  in  parallel  to  the  exper-
imental programs but  more  importantly,  the  outcome  should  be
fed back to guide experimental work to be more focused on the
performance-limiting  and  environmental-damaging  steps.  Future
conceptual  design  integrated  with  modeling  and  validation  re-
search efforts should bridge the gaps and explore a wider range
of pyrolysis systems, particularly focusing on:

1. The potential contribution of pyrolysis to the waste-based cir-

cular economy for carbon and nutrient resource recovery;

2. Mobile distributed process design and the comparison between
centralized and decentralized systems to identify the optimal
configurations for various feedstocks using computer-aided de-
sign and simulation;

3. Comparison  of  different  reactors,  as  well  as  pretreat-
ment/upgrading technologies for desirable products, in addition
to the overall hydrogen balancing;

4. Trade-offs between optimal cost and environmental objectives
in different process configurations to derive the desired pyroly-
sis products as alternatives to fossil counterparts;

5. Modeling fast pyrolysis with multiple processing and catalytic
steps,  where  the  complexity  of  underlying  chemistry  is  ac-
counted  for,  and  understanding  of  how  such  complexity  im-
pacts the techno-economic performances of pyrolysis system;
6. Comparison  between  fast  pyrolysis  and  other  cost-effective
routes  with  simpler  underlying  chemistry  and  more  control-
lable pathways such as gasification-synthesis;

7. Model validation based on the techno-economic performances

of industry-scale fast pyrolysis.

3. Catalysis

Catalysts  play  a  significant  role  in  in-situ  catalytic  pyrolysis
or ex-situ upgrading and impact the overall multi-scale design of
these processes. Catalytic upgrading of bio-oil requires a compre-
hensive understanding of the chemistry of the reactions that pro-
duce the desired products and identifying the catalyst species that
would favor these transformations at different process configura-
tions so that an optimum combination of catalyst and process de-
sign is selected. This is a complex challenge due to multiple rea-
sons:

1. There are many components present in crude bio-oil, derived
from  simultaneous  or  sequential  reactions  happening  during
biomass pyrolysis. As an example, the number of oxygenated
compounds in a typical bio-oil is over 300 [75] . Selecting a cat-
alyst that selectively converts these species into desired prod-
ucts with low levels of by-product formation, is challenging.
2. The  biomass  composition  is  also  often  subject  to  significant
variation  due  to  non-homogeneities  in  the  biomass  feed  and
pyrolysis conditions, and therefore identifying a catalyst which
is robust to these changes can be difficult, but important for the
multiple aspects of pyrolysis and upgrading processes.

3. Finally, the catalyst ‘apparent’ performance is dependent on the
type of reactor and operating conditions, and therefore identi-
fying the most optimal combination of catalyst type and oper-
ating conditions is a major challenge in the multi-scale process
development.

This section starts with a comprehensive review of the current
level of knowledge of different upgrading catalysts and the kinetic
paths  they  would  trigger.  Different  catalyst  deactivation  mecha-
nisms that reduce catalytic activity are then reviewed. Finally, the
main challenges that should be addressed in future research works
are breifly.

3.1. Catalyst components

A good catalyst should have enough catalytic activity as well as
stability, high selectivity toward desired compounds, low hydrogen
consumption  in  the  case  of  hydrodeoxygenation  and  hydrogena-
tion, and finally low cost. These features are important not only
at the catalyst scale but also at the process scale. An ideal cata-
lyst choice would improve process compactness, economy, and ef-
ficiency toward selective products. However, it is often difficult to
have all the benefits mentioned before due to the complexity of
the  feed  compounds  and  reaction  schemes,  as  well  as  the  com-
plex  interaction  of  the  catalyst  performance  and  process  condi-
tions (reactor type, temperature, pressure, space velocity, etc.), and
hence in most cases a balanced trade-off amongst all these crite-
ria is targeted. This section explores catalysts applied in different

pyrolysis schemes. In addition, the interaction between the catalyst
selection and other process aspects (economic performance, envi-
ronmental impacts,  etc.)  is  investigated,  to  provide  a  multi-scale
perspective of pyrolysis upgrading catalysis.

Both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts have been used
in  catalytic  pyrolysis  and  upgrading  (see  Fig.  3.1 ).  Homogeneous
catalysts are defined as the catalysts that are in the same phase
as  the  reactant(s)  ( e.g.  bio-oil),  whereas  heterogeneous  catalysts
are those existing in another phase than the reaction media. Ho-
mogeneous catalysts are more common for in-situ catalytic pyrol-
ysis  [20,180] ,  whereas  heterogeneous  catalysts  are  used  for  both
in-situ and ex-situ upgrading (see Section 2.2 for further details).
Compared to homogeneous catalysts which contain only one phase
(active species), the design of heterologous catalysts is more com-
plex and consists of (a) active species, (b) support, and (c) poten-
tially promotors as shown in Fig. 3.1 . The overall (intrinsic) perfor-
mance of the catalyst is not only a function of individual catalyst
components, but also the interactions between active species, sup-
port, and/or promoter. Note that, as discussed previously, the ap-
parent catalyst performance is a function of these, as well as the
process  and reactor  configurations that  impact the  transfer phe-
nomena (heat transfer, mass and momentum transfer) around and
within the catalyst particles. The main components of the upgrad-
ing catalysts are reviewed in Sections 3.1.1 –3.1.3 .

3.1.1. Active species

The  main  role  of  active  species  is  to  activate  certain  reac-
tion  pathways  that  would  convert  a  wide  range  of  bio-oil  com-
pounds  into  desirable  and  stable  products.  The  diverse  range  of
transformations possible for bio-oil upgrading including cracking,
carbonylation, decarboxylation, hydrocracking, hydrodeoxygenation
and hydrogenation, and as a result, understanding how various ac-
tive species differentiate themselves in activating certain reaction
paths is crucial in enhancing our understanding of upgrading catal-
ysis, and how they can impact the overall process design. The most
common types of active species are explained in Sections 3.1.1.1 –
3.1.1.8 .

3.1.1.1. Soluble minerals.  Soluble inorganics are the main homoge-
neous catalysts explored in bio-oil upgrading, mainly in in-situ CFP
of lignocellulosic biomass [20,180] . Although mineral matter natu-
rally present in the biomass has been shown to help with the de-
composition of cellulose component [181] , the mineral-aided de-
composition results in the formation of more solids than gaseous

4 , and ZnCl

2 , NaCl, FeSO

products [182–185] . This could, in turn, results in higher char for-
mation  especially  if  potassium  and  calcium  are  present  in  the
biomass  [183,186–188] ,  and  can  impact  the  overall  process  effi-
ciency,  capital  cost,  and  environmental  performance,  as  further
downstream upgrading would be required. Other soluble inorgan-
2 also affect the product
ics such as MgCl
distribution,  decomposition  temperature,  and/or  biomass  weight
loss  as  shown  by  Varhegyi  et  al.  [189,190] .  MgCl
2  for  example,
leads  to  lower  aldehydes,  ketones,  furans,  and  2-furfuraldehydes
yields, whereas NaCl makes the decomposition envelope larger, i.e.
the thermal decomposition starts at a lower temperature and ends
at  a  higher  temperature.  This  wider  decomposition  envelope  re-
sults in a larger fraction of lower molecular weight chemicals being
produced, by up to 3 times. This could be beneficial in terms of the
process design and scale-up as simpler and/or smaller downstream
unit  operations  would  be  required.  In  addition,  the  presence  of
sodium helps with the suppression of transglycolylation reactions.
This  means  that  a  much  lower  fraction  of  complex  compounds
such as levoglucosan is formed in the presence of NaCl compared
to in its absence (0.4 wt.% vs. 36 wt.% [189,191,192] ). The presence
of FeSO
4 also helps to reduce the decomposition onset temperature
by about 50 °C but has the disadvantage of increasing levoglucosan
and levoglucosenone production [189,190,193] which is not favor-
able  from  a  process  development  perspective,  as  more  complex
downstream separation and upgrading techniques would be then
needed. Other soluble minerals also affect levoglucosan formation
and this is affected by both the cations and anions present in the
minerals [194] . It was shown that the levoglucosan yield reduces
in the following order K +  > Na +  > Ca 2 +  > Mg 2 +  for cations and
C l − > NO −
4  for anions. Table 3.1 provides a
summary of the effect of the soluble catalysts on in-situ catalytic
pyrolysis processes.

3.1.1.2. Noble  and  non-noble  transition  metals.  Metal-based  sup-
ported catalysts are among the most commonly used, for both in-
situ and ex-situ upgrading of the primary pyrolysis vapors or bio-
oil via hydrotreatment. A wide variety of single-metallic and multi-
metallic catalysts have been investigated as depicted in Tables 3.2 .
Iron,  cobalt,  nickel,  and  molybdenum  are  the  most  active  non-
noble  metals  whereas  ruthenium,  palladium,  rhodium,  platinum,
and iridium are the most active noble catalysts used.

Noble metals normally provide a higher activity in hydrotreat-
ment  reactions,  especially  hydrodeoxygenation  (HDO)  [239,254–
260] ,  compared  to  non-noble  metals.  This  could  enhance  the

economics of the process. Gutierrez et al. [257] for example, re-
ported that the activity of the catalysts for guaiacol HDO decreases

in  the  following  order:  Rh/ZrO

non-noble metals [239,254–260] as demonstrated in Fig. 3.2 .

Noble metals also have higher hydrogen consumption which is
not desirable [221] as hydrogen supply could be expensive if pur-
chased “over the fence”, or adds to the complications of the flow-
sheet if produced onsite. As such, less expensive non-noble metal-
based catalysts with moderate hydrogen consumption, have been
proposed as a more practical choice by many researchers for the
multi-scale design of the pyrolysis and upgrading processes.

Metallic  catalysts  generally  catalyze  more  than  one  reaction.
Therefore,  the  competition  between  the  reactions  they  catalyze
(mainly hydrodeoxygenation and hydrogenation of aromatic rings)
is a key aspect of catalyst performance. Often good hydrodeoxy-
genation and low hydrogenation of aromatic rings are desirable for
an optimal product quality [256] and this could be achieved by a
careful selection of the metal type and catalyst support. For exam-
ple, silica-supported iron catalyst offers good hydrodeoxygenation
selectivity which leads to the formation of benzene, toluene, and
xylene; without much aromatic ring hydrogenation [201] .

Another  feature  of  metallic  catalysts  that  impacts  the  multi-
scale aspects of the process is the relative level of activity against
selectivity and by-product formation. Ideally, both activity and se-
lectivity toward the desired product(s) should be high with neg-

ligible by-product formation for a catalyst to be commercially vi-
able.  However,  this  is  rarely  the  case  and,  therefore,  a  balance
needs to be established based on catalyst-process configuration. As
2 was shown to have a better activity but less
an example, Co/SiO
HDO selectivity than Fe/SiO
2  [201] . However, methane, an unde-
sired product in catalytic pyrolysis, is produced less with an iron-
based catalyst than on a cobalt-based catalyst [201] .

The  performance  of  metallic  catalysts  is  also  affected  by  the
composition of primary pyrolysis vapors. In [216] for example, CO
2 catalyst deactivation re-
was shown to lower the rate of a Fe/SiO
sulting in an improved guaiacol hydrodeoxygenation, whereas CO
2
resulted in iron carburization and coke formation which reduced
the  initial  reaction  rate.  Steam  present  in  the  pyrolysis  mixture
promoted the hydrolysis of adsorbed precursors and thus higher
rates of phenols than benzene was obtained, as well as a lower
overall conversion. Methane did not have a noticeable impact on
the  overall  conversion.  The  results  of  these  investigations  could
help to better understand and “design” the multi-scale aspects of
the process, for example, by optimizing the concentration of car-
bon monoxide or steam through recycling or purge streams.

Metallic  catalysts  that  promote  a  network  of  reactions  rather
than just one or two have been also studied in the literature and
showed  some  advantages  in  scaling-up  the  upgrading  processes.
Copper chromite (Cu
5 ) for example, was suggested [215] to
trigger  the  hydrogenation  and  hydrogenolysis  reactions  by  cop-
2 O
per  and  the  dehydration  and  transalkylation  reactions  by  Cr

(a weak acid). This resulted in benzene as a major product from
anisole conversion via the demethoxylation route. The authors in-
ferred that this combined reaction pathway gives unique selectiv-
ity with the advantage of removing hydroxyl and methoxy groups,
compared to conventional hydroprocessing catalysts which only ac-
celerate demethylation and transalkylation reactions. This results
in more intensified processes with potentially better economic and
environmental footprint.

Researchers  also  investigated  catalysts  with  multiple  active
species.  Bimetallic  catalysts  containing  rhodium  and  either  plat-
inum or palladium showed better results compared to monometal-
lic platinum or palladium catalysts [257] . Similarly, Ni–Cu/ δ-Al
2 O
3
showed [228] higher activity than a monometallic nickel. It was
suggested that copper reduces the incorporation of nickel into the
bulk  alumina  and  therefore  spinel  formation,  resulting  in  more
nickel being available for catalytic reactions. This bimetallic cata-
lyst can, therefore, improve the process costs in two ways: first by
reducing the catalyst volume or extending the catalyst life-cycle,
and second by ensuring lower catalyst costs, as copper is a cheaper
metal compared to nickel (see Fig. 3.2 ). Considering the fact that
copper  is  also  more  abundant  than  nickel,  it  could  improve  the
supply  chain  of  the  catalyst  manufacturing.  A  challenging  issue
with  the  bimetallic  catalyst  is,  however,  their  recycling  as  metal
separation could be costly and complicated.

3.1.1.3. Base  and  transition  metal  oxides.  Metal  oxides  in  general
and  transition  metal  oxides  in  particular  have  been  the  major
catalyst choice for various applications [263,264] . Several unsup-
ported/supported transition and non-transition metal oxides have
been  used  in  catalytic  pyrolysis  and  particularly  in  in-situ  CFP
[265] .  The  unique  performance  of  metal  oxides  is  due  to  their
redox  or  acid-base  properties  (especially  in  the  case  of  transi-
tion metal oxides) which promotes the thermal decomposition of
biomass as well as catalytic upgrading of pyrolysis intermediates
[263,264,266] .

Metal  oxides  with  Lewis  acidic  properties  (such  as  alumina,
silica,  and  alumina-silica),  or  sulfated  metal  oxides  (such  as
SO 2 −
4  / SnO 2 ) with Brønsted acidity are
among the first group of metal oxide catalysts investigated in CFP
[267–271] . Acidic metal oxides were shown to increase the gas (in-

4  / ZrO 2 , and SO 2 −

4  / TiO 2 , SO 2 −

1 -C

cluding steam) and solids yields at the expense of liquid content
[271] .  The  increase  in  the  gas  content  is  partly  due  to  a  higher
CO yield as acidic metal oxides catalyze decarbonylation reactions
as well as C
4 hydrocarbon production reactions [271] . The liq-
uid composition also changes when acidic metal oxides are added.
Higher acidity catalysts such as alumina, increase the aromatic and
polycyclic aromatic content of the bio-oil and increase the overall
anhydrosugar yields [267] , whereas weaker acids such as silica re-
duce oxygenate ( e.g. aldehydes, ketones, and acids) content as well
as coke and polycyclic aromatic formation [268] . Sulfated metal ox-
ides also impact the liquid composition based on their Brønsted
acidity. SO 2 −
4  / SnO 2 for example, provides the highest selectivity to-
ward 5-methyl furfural in CFP, whereas SO 2 −
4  / ZrO 2
offer higher selectivity for furfural and furan respectively [269] . All
these three catalysts are effective in reducing the yields of levoglu-
cosan and hydroxyacetaldehyde [269,270] and are potentially ad-
vantageous for the process development, as simpler downstream
separation or upgrading would be needed.

4  / TiO 2 and SO 2 −

Base metal oxides have been also utilized in CFP as they are ac-
tive for ketonization and aldol condensation of carboxylic acid and
carbonyl compounds [265] . Alkaline oxides  such  as  MgO  or  CaO
provide both acidic properties through their metallic ions and ba-
sic behavior through the oxide ions [263] . This gives them unique
characteristics, with MgO for instance, being an effective catalyst in
enhancing the quality of the bio-oil produced in terms of hydro-
carbon distribution ( i.e. higher fraction of lighter aliphatic hydro-
carbons), higher heating value, and significantly lower oxygenate
content [271,272] , albeit at the price of lower overall bio-oil yields.
2  yield  through  ketonization  of  car-
MgO  also  increases  the  CO
boxylic  acids  [271] .  The  addition  of  CaO  to  CFP  was  also  found
to be advantageous in reducing the selectivity to phenols and an-
hydrosugars significantly [273] . CaO is also an effective ketoniza-
tion catalyst, limits the carboxylic acid formation, and increases ke-
tones and cyclopentanones selectivities [273] . This is in addition to
the higher production of lighter compounds such as methanol, 2-
butanone, acetone, and acetaldehyde in the presence of CaO [273] .
In summary, CaO improves the multi-scale aspects of the process,
although comparative analysis can help to make sure all the in-
volved phenomena are well understood.

chemistry is quite diverse, but in general, most of them ( e.g. Fe
3 ,
NiO, TiO
2 , and ZnO) reduce bio-oil yield and increase gas, solid,
and  water  contents  [273] .  Carbon  dioxide  and  hydrogen  yields
were increased in the presence of NiO suggesting that nickel ox-
ide is favoring steam reforming [271] . Higher hydrogen production
could  help  the  economics  of  the  process,  although  nickel-based
catalysts are relatively more expensive, so the overall implication
2  was increased without a signif-
needs detailed investigation. CO
icant change in H

however, showed poor liquid selectivity, similar to Fe
3 [271,273] .
Given the high price of Zr-based material, ZrO
2 might not be
2 /TiO
the optimal catalyst choice for the industrial application. Fast py-
rolysis of rice husk in the presence of ZnO showed reduced bio-
oil content, although the produced bio-oil contained a higher frac-
tion  of  lower  molecular  weight  compounds  and  less  oxygenates
[276] . Hydrogen atom transfer in the cracking reactions was also
accelerated  by  ZnO  [278] .  Phenol  and  light  phenolics  were  pro-
3 assisted CFP at 450 °C [279] . Ketonization and
duced in FeO-Cr
aldol condensation of carbonyl compounds were found to be cat-
alyzed by silica-supported basic oxide metals such as CeO
3 ,
MnO
2 [274,275,277] . Ke-
2 , MgO, ZnO, and ZrO
tonization was suggested to be inhibited by furfural, whereas the
presence of water and phenols did not impact ketonization. CeO
2
was suggested to be a very good candidate for ketonization and
the activity could be even improved further if CeO
2 was supported
on alumina or titania, or if the catalyst was doped with a strong
base [265] . Cesium is, however, a very rare element, and mass pro-
duction of Ce-based catalyst could not be sustainable and afford-
2  and
able. Bimetallic oxides containing ceria such as Mn
ZrO
2  alone
2  also  showed  higher  activity  compared  to  CeO
[274] ,  offering  the  advantages  of  increased  activity  and  reduced
costs. Conversion of small oxygenates into larger hydrocarbons was
also promoted by mixed ZnO and ZrO
2 oxides at 400–550 °C and
0.1 MPa [280–282] .

3.1.1.4. Transition metal carbides.  There have been few studies on
the  performance  of  carbide-based  catalysts  in  hydrodeoxygena-
tion of biomass. Some metal carbides have shown a better perfor-
mance than metallic or even bimetallic catalysts. Jongerius et al.
[219] for example, studied W
2 C/CNF and reported
higher selectivity and conversion to phenolic compounds than with
3 . When comparing different metal carbide-based cat-
CoMo/Al
alysts,  the  activity,  selectivity,  and  stability  of  Mo
2 C/CNF  were
higher than W
2 C/CNF. The yields of completely deoxygenated aro-
matic compounds such as benzene and toluene were also higher in
2 C/CNF and the yields were positively affected by the tempera-
Mo
ture and the time online. Table 3.4 gives a summary of the metal
carbide catalysts studied for catalytic pyrolysis.

2 O

The implications of carbide-based catalysts on the overall pro-
cess include catalyst preparation which could be challenging with
limited vendors to choose from. Carbides also have a different ther-

mal conductivity than base and transition metal oxides, so reactor
heat transfer can be affected.

3.1.1.5. Transition metal sulfides.  The sulfide form of metals is the
main  active  phase  for  the  petroleum/natural  gas  hydroprocess-
ing.  However,  in  normal  cases,  there  is  no  need  to  presulfide
the  catalyst  as  the  catalyst  is  sulfided  upon  exposure  to  the
sulfur-containing  species  in  the  feed.  This  is,  however,  not  the
case  for  biomass-derived  feeds  with  zero  sulfur  levels,  and  as
a  result,  presulfiding  of  the  catalyst  can  enhance  its  hydrotreat-
ment  activity.  The  alternative  is  to  add  a  small  flow  of  sulfur-
2 S  or  a  thiol  to  the  upgrading  sec-
containing  species  such  as  H
tion feed [234,235,283] , but this can poison further downstream
catalysts  and  pollute  the  final  product,  or  release  to  the  atmo-
sphere.  H
2 S  can  also  inhibit  hydrogenolysis  and  hydrogenation
pathways if present at high partial pressures [284] . Supported or
2 )  or  multi-
non-supported  single  metallic  sulfides  (such  as  MoS
metallic sulfides (such as CoMoS, NiMoS, or CoMoWS) have been
tested  for  hydrotreatment  of  biomass-derived  feeds  by  several
researchers  [200,202,206,230,254,257,285–294]  as  summarized  in
Table 3.5 .

Huuska [200] investigated the effect of metal content  on the
performance  of  sulfided  Ni/ γ -Al
3  catalysts.  Under  similar  op-
2 O
erating  conditions,  the  anisole  conversion  of  0.5%  Ni-containing
catalyst was more than twice that of the catalyst containing 11%
of  Ni.  This  was  attributed  to  the  stronger  support  effect  in  the
low nickel-containing catalyst. The product distribution, however,
showed higher HDO selectivity for 11%Ni/ γ -Al
3 suggesting that
high metal content is advantageous for the upgrading of primary
pyrolysis vapors or bio-oil. Nickel is, however, an expensive metal.
Therefore, the trade-off between more expensive catalysts versus
more efficient upgrading processes needs to be investigated from a
multi-scale perspective.

2 O

The  positive  effect  of  (pre-)sulfiding  the  metallic  catalyst  has
been shown in several studies. Sulfiding CoMo/Al
3 , for example,
improved the conversion of phenols to benzene and cyclohexane
[301] or the conversion of guaiacol [302] . There have been, how-
ever, a few reports on faster deactivation of sulfided catalyst (by
carbon  deposition)  and  the  risk  of  sulfur-contaminated  products
[257] .  The  environmental  impacts  of  (pre-)sulfiding  the  metallic
catalyst, and the required safety concerns also need to be consid-
ered in the overall process design.

3.1.1.6. Transition  metal  phosphides.  The  idea  of  using  transition
metal  phosphides  in  bio-oil  upgrading  [221,298,303,304]  comes
also  from  petroleum  hydroprocessing.  A  summary  of  the  metal

was still higher than sulfided catalysts, due to their higher number
of  Brønsted  acid  sites  favoring  the  demethylation  pathway.  The
higher activity of metal phosphides translates into lower catalyst
loading  when  the  process  is  scaled  up.  Other  reactions  that  are
triggered  by  metal  phosphides  are  phenol  hydrogenolysis  and
benzene hydrogenation [303] . The catalysts’ stability and activity
were shown to be correlated with the active phase composition.
For instance, bimetallic NiMoP/SiO
2  catalysts offer higher activity
and stability, when the Ni/Mo ratio was increased [303] .

3.1.1.7. Transition metal nitrides.  Metal nitrides have been also un-
der scrutiny based on their proven performance in petroleum hy-
droprocessing. The electronegativity difference between metal and
nitrogen atoms is higher than with sulfur or phosphorus, mean-
ing  the  nitride-based  catalysts  offer  both  acidic  and  basic  active
sites, allowing additional reaction pathways to be activated, as well
as potentially reducing the required hydrogen consumption [256] .
There  are  also  reports  indicating  potential  nitrogen  release  from
the bulk lattice enabling the creation of surface active sites which
are beneficial for chemical adsorption and/or catalysis [306] . Metal
nitride  catalysts  also  offer  an  easier  synthesis  and  lower  overall
price which can benefit the multi-scale process design. Higher re-
sistance  to  oxidation  is  another  advantage  which  comes  to  use
with the large fraction of oxygen-containing compounds in the bio-
oil.  These  catalysts  also  possess  a  lower  environmental  footprint
and allow a safer plant design compared to sulfided or phosphided
catalysts.

One of few drawbacks of transition metal nitrides, however, is
that there is little work reported on their hydrotreatment activity
[301,307] , and hence their comprehensive comparison with other
catalysts is not easy. One of the few works addressing metal ni-
tride catalysts is the Ghampson et al.’s study [220,308] suggesting
that γ -Mo
2 N has higher activity in the conversion of guaiacol to
phenol, than β-Mo
2 or Mo. They also reported higher
yields of completely deoxygenated products but lower overall ac-
tivity  when  bimetallic  CoMoN  catalysts  instead  of  monometallic
Mo
2 N were used. A summary of the studies conducted on metal
nitrides is provided in Table 3.7 .

3.1.1.8. Zeolites.  Zeolites  were  initially  considered  as  they  have
been successfully used in refining or petrochemical processes such

as fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) or methanol-to-gasoline. Zeolites
provide both acidic properties and shape selectivity and thus fa-
vor reactions that convert biomass into fuels and chemicals [309] .
Medium pore sized zeolites with average internal pore space and
steric hindrance, were identified as optimal choices for the CFP of
glucose and other biomass feedstock into aromatics [281] .

Protonated  microporous  ZSM-5  is  the  most  studied  zeolite
due  to  its  good  shape  selectivity  (with  medium-sized  pores  of
0.54 nm  x  0.56 nm),  strong  acidity  [265] ,  and  stability  at  higher
temperatures  and  wet  conditions  [75] .  The  small  pore  sizes  of
ZSM-5  prevent  large  molecules  from  diffusing  into  their  struc-
ture and the compounds produced would not be larger than the
size of a trimethyl-benzene molecule [310] . This makes ZSM-5 the
most effective catalyst for aromatics production in ex-situ upgrad-
ing  of  primary  pyrolysis  vapors  [311–314] .  ZSM-5  was  found  to
catalyze a large catalytic reaction network e.g. deoxygenation, de-
carboxylation, cracking, disproportionation, isomerization, cycliza-
tion, aromatization, alkylation, oligomerization, and polymerization
[310,315–318] .  Steam  co-feeding  was  also  shown  to  improve  the
quality  of  the  distillate  fraction  produced  on  ZSM-5,  i.e.  reduc-
ing  catalyst  usage  or  hydrogen  economy,  although  the  aromatic
selectivity  was  reduced  slightly  [310] .  In  addition,  ZSM-5  results
in  the  oxygen  present  in  biomass  to  be  rejected  as  either  H
2 O
or  CO
X  at  lower  or  higher  reaction  temperatures  [319] ,  respec-
tively resulting in potentially a drop of > 25% in the bio-oil oxygen
content [320] .

Zeolite acidity can impact the catalyst activity and/or selectivity.
HZSM-5, for example, offers strong Brønsted acidity which results
in the activation of a wide reaction mechanism as explained above
via a carbonium ion mechanism [280,321] . Full or partial replace-
ment of H with K results in either almost complete activity loss,
and a significant decrease in the distillate selectivity, respectively
[314,322] . Strong acidity and shape selectivity of HZSM-5 also max-
imizes aromatic production whereas HY zeolites and silica-alumina
for example, result in aliphatic hydrocarbon production [311,323] .
The acidity of HZM-5 can also be tuned by varying the Si/Al ra-
tio to achieve certain product selectivity targets [313,324,325] . Liu
et al. however indicated that using very low Al/Si can potentially
lead  to  the  dealuminization  under  hydrothermal  conditions  and
potential catalyst instability [75] .

M. Sharifzadeh, M. Sadeqzadeh and M. Guo et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 71 (2019) 1–80

Another possibility to fine-tune the zeolite activity is through
the incorporation of metal cations or oxides. Examples of this in-
clude  NiZSM-5,  CoZSM-5,  CeZSM-5,  GaZSM-5,  H/[Co]ZSM-5,  and
H/[Al,Fe]ZSM-5 which proved efficient in the upgrading of bio-oil
[326] . A summary of the bio-oil upgrading catalysts using zeolites
is provided in Table 3.8 .

3.1.2. Supports

Supports provide a high surface area (up to 100 m 2 /g) needed
for heterogeneous catalysis, so that active species can be both dis-
persed and stabilized [256] , providing the required accessibility for
the reactants adsorption and reactions on the catalyst surface. They
also reduce the cost of the catalysts used and allow the expensive
active species to be utilized efficiently. Another feature of bio-oil
upgrading supports is their acidity. A higher level of acidity pro-
vides  more  activity  for  certain  reactions  such  as  transalkylation.
Huuska [200] studied the effect of support acidity on the perfor-
mance of Mo- or Ni-containing catalysts in anisole hydrogenolysis,
and  observed  that  acidic  supports  promoted  rapid  methyl  group
transfer, leading to the formation of phenol and methyl substituted
phenols.

Higher acidity, however, leads to more coke formation in pro-
cesses such as hydrodeoxygenation [291] . As a result, a balanced
acidity is required to minimize coke formation while achieving the
required activity. Developing supports such as carbon, ZrO
2 , SiO
2
and MgO that provide optimized acidity, reduce H
2 consumption,
and enhance direct oxygen removal, have been the subject of sev-
eral recent studies [203,287,288,291,347] .

3.1.2.1. Alumina (Al 2 O 3 ).  Alumina is by far the most common sup-
port used in bio-oil upgrading catalysts. This is mainly because alu-
mina is cheap, can be manufactured/purchased in bulk quantities,
and  offers  lar ge  surface  areas.  Alumina  also  offers  higher  activi-
ties than SiO
2 and carbon supports, although it also leads to higher
coke formation [226] due to its higher acidity levels.

The  high  acidity  of  alumina  also  favors  rapid  methyl  group
transfer  (or  demethylation),  favoring  the  formation  of  catechol
and methylphenols [200,230,288] . Other compounds produced on
alumina  include  deoxygenated  compounds  such  as  benzene,  cy-
clohexene,  and  cyclohexane  [300] ,  although  to  a  lower  content
[225,257,288] .

3.1.2.2. Silica (SiO 2 ) and mesoporous silica (SBA-15 and SBA-16).  Sil-
ica  is  also  commonly  used  in  the  hydrotreatment  of  biomass-
derived feedstock. Silica-supported catalysts typically show lower
activity than those supported on alumina. However, coke forma-
tion is in general lower on SiO
2 -supported catalysts, due to their
lower acidity [226] . The main products of silica-supported catalysts
are phenol and deoxygenated compounds [300] , mainly from the
demethoxylation route. Phenols can be also produced, as explained
previously,  on  alumina  with  the  demethylation  route.  Therefore,
the  overall  phenol  selectivity  on  silica  could  be  higher  or  lower

than  on  alumina.  For  example,  ReS

Catalysts supported on mesoporous silica such as SBA-15 and
SBA-16  have  similar  properties  to  those  supported  on  SiO
2  ( e.g.
higher phenol/catechol yields than on alumina-supported catalysts
[348] )  with  the  added  advantage  that  mesoporous  silica  offers
higher surface areas [308] and the potential for adjusted frame-
work compositions for optimal performance ( i.e. higher selectivity
toward certain desired products and lower coke formation) [286] ,
albeit at a higher catalyst cost.

3.1.2.3. Titania (TiO 2 ).  Titania has been identified by several stud-
ies [230,288] as a suitable support for bio-oil hydrodeoxygenation.

However, it has a higher price and lower surface area [223] com-
pared to alumina or silica resulting in its limited industrial-scale
application.

Titania  offers  a  higher  Brønsted  acidity  (but  lower  overall
acidity)  than  alumina  or  zirconia  [288]  and  thus  activates  both
demethylation and hydrogenation routes. Higher demethylation ac-
tivity means methane formation is higher on TiO
2 -supported cata-
lysts as shown in Fig. 3.3 ; and higher hydrogenation rates result in
higher H
2 consumption. Both of these effects have implications for
large-scale industrial applications, which need to be considered.

TiO

2 offers a higher selectivity toward fully deoxygenated com-
pounds compared to alumina-supported catalysts. This selectivity
is, however, lower than on ZrO

2 [288] .

3.1.2.4. Zirconia (ZrO 2 ).  Zirconia is another expensive support can-
didate  for  hydrotreatment  of  bio-oil  which  offers  high  activity
and a higher selectivity for hydrogenolysis compared to γ -alumina
and titania [230,288] . Low methane formation as demonstrated in
Fig. 3.3 and efficient conversion of guaiacol into deoxygenated hy-
drocarbons ( i.e. low hydrogen consumption rate) [288] are the two
main advantages of zirconia over alumina or titania. Zirconia also
simplifies the reaction network, and Bui et al. [288] suggested that
this means direct conversion of guaiacol into phenol and then into
benzene, in the case of CoMoS/ZrO
2 , which is a significant added
value, as it allows simpler downstream processing.

3.1.2.5. Cerium  oxide  (CeO 2 ).  Cerium  oxide  has  been  studied  in
few  works  as  a  hydrotreatment  support.  Yang  et  al.  [223]  stud-
ied 20% Ni-containing catalysts using a series of supports includ-
2 to investigate the interactions between support and ac-
ing CeO
tive species. Under similar conditions, Ni/CeO
2 showed 90% deoxy-
genation  conversion  compared  to  a  full  conversion  on  Ni/AlSBA-
15, Ni/C, Ni/SBA-15, and Ni/Al
2 -supported catalyst, how-
ever,  produced  the  highest  level  of  aromatics  ( ∼60%)  and  a  mi-
nor level of oxygenated compounds ( < 10%). It was suggested that
metal-support interactions are not very strong on CeO
2 , allowing
nickel  crystallites  to  grow,  and  the  hydrogenation  activity  to  be
promoted. The high aromatic selectivity is, therefore, explained by
anisole hydrogenolysis on relatively strong acid sites. Cerium oxide
is, also expensive and not very abundant, limiting its application in
industrial-scale processes.

3 . A CeO

2 O

3.1.2.6. Magnesium oxide (MgO).  Magnesium oxide is the main ba-
sic  support  which  has  been  investigated  in  the  literature  [349–
354] .  MgO-supported  catalysts  showed  [305]  a  high  conversion
12 -products. The
of phenol to benzene, cyclohexyl-aromatics, and C
main reaction route was suggested to be direct hydrogenolysis and
hydrogenation involving cyclohexanol as an intermediate.

Comparison of Pt/MgO and Pt/ γ -Al

3  [305] showed that the
basic  nature  of  MgO  provides  better  catalyst  stability  compared
to  the  acidic γ -alumina  although  both  catalysts  had  similar  hy-
drotreatment  activities.  MgO  provides  a  reasonable  catalyst  cost
and is quite abundant.

2 O

3.1.2.7. Mixed  oxides  (SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 ,  AlSBA-15,  SiO 2 -ZrO 2 ).  Although
using a single metal oxide support offers certain benefits, it has
also some drawbacks, as explained in Sections 3.1.2.1 –3.1.2.6 . Re-
searchers have, therefore, investigated the application of mixed ox-
ides; such as SiO
3 to combine the benefits while minimizing
2 O
the drawbacks of individually mixed oxides.

2 -Al

Fig. 3.4 demonstrates the impact of a combined silica-alumina
support  on  the  product  selectivity  of  guaiacol  conversion  [238] .
The addition of silica to alumina was shown to enhance the cat-
alyst deoxygenation activity significantly by encouraging an addi-
tional  mechanism,  i.e.  alcohols  dehydration.  Similar  trends  were
observed [223] for the combined alumina and mesoporous silica

In another study [227,355] using Ni/SiO

2 for the hydrocar-
bon production from lignin-derived bio-oil, it was shown that the
combined support structure offers an amphoteric character which
improves the stability and reduces coking on the catalyst, signifi-
cantly. The catalyst activity and high-octane hydrocarbon selectiv-
ity were also improved, suggesting this can be considered as a po-
tential catalyst in a commercial process.

3.1.2.8. Active carbon and carbon black.  Different forms of carbon
are  popular  supports  for  the  hydrotreatment  of  biomass-derived
feedstock. Gas-phase hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis of phenols over
nickel catalysts supported on active carbon showed lower activity
but also lower coke formation than on alumina-supported catalysts
[226] . This is attributed to the fact that carbon does not provide
the weak Lewis acid sites, deemed to be the main source of coke
production [291] . Ni–W catalysts supported on active carbon also
made less coke compared to alumina-supported catalysts [232] in
phenol hydrodeoxygenation.

(reprinted with permission from Yang et al. [223] ).

Another advantage of carbon-supported catalysts is their higher
selectivity toward fully deoxygenated products. This would mini-
mize any further upgrading to meet the required product specifi-
cations. For example in [223] , active carbon-supported nickel cata-
lysts showed not only similar levels of high activity, but also lower
oxygenated compounds, compared to SBA-15-, AlSBA-15-, and γ -
3 -supported catalysts. The Ni/C product distribution was sim-
Al
ilar  to  those  supported  on  reducible  oxides  like  TiO
2  and  CeO

which had significant aromatic selectivity. Benzene to cyclohexane
ratio was also the highest for Ni/C, followed by Ni/AlSBA-15 and

3.1.2.9. HY zeolites.  Application of zeolites as catalyst support for
bio-oil  hydrotreatment  has  been  also  considered  in  the  litera-
ture. HY zeolites showed to offer similar hydrodeoxygenation and
transalkylation  activity  as  Al
3 ,  although  their  activity  toward
oxygen removal reactions is often limited [247,356] . HY zeolites are
also more expensive than alumina, impacting the overall process
economics if they were to be used.

3.1.3. Promoters

Promoters  are  compounds  that  when  added  to  a  catalyst  in
small  amounts,  improve  its  performance  significantly.  Promoters
reduce active metal content needed, and potentially reduce cata-
lyst costs. Promoters also improve the product distribution so sim-
pler downstream units would be required. Nickel and cobalt are
the main promoters investigated for bio-oil upgrading. These are
explained in Sections 3.1.3.1 and 3.1.3.2 below.

3.1.3.1. Nickel.  Nickel  is  the  most  common  promoter,  studied  for
catalytic pyrolysis, typically for sulfided molybdenum catalysts on
alumina. The model based on the so-called “Ni(Co)–Mo–S” struc-
ture is the most widely accepted way of explaining the promot-
ing effects that nickel or cobalt have [357–359] . The model sug-
gests that nickel or cobalt atoms donate electrons to molybdenum,
weakening  the  existing  molybdenum-sulfur  bond  [360,361]  and
creating the Ni(Co)-Mo-S structure on the edges of the MoS
2 slabs.
The creation of this structure leads to the formation of coordina-
tively unsaturated sites [294] , increasing the number of active sites
2 cata-
available for reaction. As an example, nickel-promoted MoS

29

lyst was shown to have a higher 2-ethylphenol hydrodeoxygena-
tion activity than unpromoted catalyst by a factor of 1.7 [205] . In
another study [294] , NiMo sulfides were shown to be more active
than nickel or molybdenum sulfides alone. The authors varied the
Ni/(Ni + Mo) ratio and observed the maximum activity at a ratio of
0.3 mol/mol. This was explained by the high degree of dispersion at
this ratio which would generate a more active NiMoS phase, and a
higher catalytic activity.

3.1.3.2. Cobalt.  Cobalt  is  another  promoter,  widely  used  for  het-
erogeneous upgrading catalysts, again in MoS
2 catalysts primarily.
Cobalt works similar to nickel in terms of incorporation into the
active phase structure, and as a result, its impact on the catalytic
performance is relatively comparable. For example, Romero et al.
3  catalyst
[205] demonstrated that the activity of CoMoS
2 / γ -
was  similar  to  NiMoS
Al

Cobalt was also shown to improve the rate of direct deoxygena-
tion reaction [230,288] . The mechanism was suggested to be close
to the well-known increase of direct desulfurization pathway, ac-
tivated by cobalt promoted molybdenum sulfide catalysts, used in
hydrocarbon hydrodesulfurization.

Cobalt, however, is more expensive than nickel with the current
bulk prices of about $29.0 and $10.3 per kilogram for cobalt and
nickel,  respectively  [261] .  This  suggests  that  if  Ni  and  Co  would
improve the catalyst performance by the same extent, it would be
more economical to use Ni than Co.

3.2. Catalyst deactivation and regeneration

Catalyst  deactivation  is  another  important  aspect  of  catalytic
pyrolysis, and can impact the catalyst, process, and the choice of
operating conditions at large scales. Like other catalysts used else-
where in the chemical industry, deactivation of upgrading catalysts
is rarely due to a single mechanism. In fact, a combination of dif-
ferent mechanisms contributes to the loss of activity with time on-
line, with the main contributors suggested to be coke deposition,
poisoning, and dealumination [256,347] .

As  already  mentioned,  upgrading  biomass-derived  feedstock
takes place via a complex reaction network and deactivation can
influence certain pathways along this network. In hydrotreatment
processes,  for  instance,  Zhu  et  al.  [250]  observed  that  deactiva-
tion affected the reaction rates for both hydrodeoxygenation and
other related reactions such as transalkylation. There were, how-
ever, some differences in the way deactivation affected these re-
actions, depending on where the reactions take place ( i.e. on the
metal particles, or the acidic support).

The  main  deactivation  and  regeneration  mechanisms  of  cata-
lysts used in pyrolysis and upgrading are reviewed briefly in this
section.

3.2.1. Coking

Coking which is the result of polymerization or polycondensa-
tion on the catalyst surface is by far the most important deacti-
vation mechanism for bio-oil upgrading catalysts. Coking inhibits
active sites from being available for reaction, and may contribute
to  the  pore  blockage,  affecting  the  diffusion  of  the  reactants  or
the  products  into  or  out  of  the  pores.  Coking  was  shown  to  be
dependent on the catalyst properties ( e.g. active species and sup-
port types) as well as on operating conditions (feedstock compo-
sition,  temperature,  pressure,  contact  time,  etc.).  For  example,  it
was shown in [247] that the deactivation rate of an HY zeolite-
supported  Pt  catalyst  was  about  5  times  that  of  a  γ -alumina-
supported catalyst in the guaiacol conversion ,  mainly due to the
faster blockage of zeolites narrow pores by carbon deposition com-
pared to wider alumina pores. Besides the pore dimensions, the

support  acidity  also  influences  the  coke  formation  [362]  or  de-
activation, as discussed in Section 3.1.2 . Although the main com-
ponents of any pyrolysis bio-oil are unsaturates with a potential
to cause carbon deposition, some were found to be more prone
to  carbon  formation  than  others.  For  instance,  although  pheno-
lic compounds were shown to adsorb strongly on the surface, re-
ducing active sites accessibility [363] , compounds such as catechol
containing both an aromatic ring and more than one oxygen atom
in their structure were found to have a higher carbon deposition
risk [208,210,298] . Reduced temperature and contact time as well
as increased hydrogen partial pressure, were found to be advan-
tageous in reducing such risk [250,286,303] as they would reduce
the adsorption rate of heavy compounds and saturate more unsat-
urated components, respectively. The presence of steam was also
shown to reduce coke deposition due to partial steam gasification
and reforming [310,316,364] . Steam co-feeding is therefore recom-
mended to be considered when designing industrial CFP processes.
Steam can be generated using waste heat recovery downstream of
the reactor.

3.2.2. Poisoning

Poisoning  is  another  phenomenon  that  can  impact  upgrading
catalysts,  mainly  because  of  the  oxygen  and  nitrogen  contain-
ing  components  in  the  biomass.  Poisonous  materials  block  cer-
tain  sites  on  the  catalyst,  or  compete  with  the  reacting  com-
pounds, thus reducing the overall catalyst activity. Similar to cok-
ing, the level of poisoning impact on the catalyst performance de-
pends  on  the  catalyst  type  and  the  operating  conditions  [347] .
Oxygen-containing  compounds  including  water  reduce  the  activ-
ity of metal sulfide and metal phosphate catalysts [303,365] sig-
nificantly,  most  likely  by  the  oxidation  of  the  active  species
[303] . For sulfide catalysts, a small flow of sulfur-containing feed
can  help  to  maintain  catalyst  structure  and  thus  activity,  but
there  is  a  risk  other  sulfur-containing  compounds  being  formed
[232,257,283,365] which needs to be carefully monitored. Resulfid-
ing of a deactivated catalyst is another option explored by Ode-
bunmi and Ollis [366] which showed to help with activity recov-
ery.

3.2.3. Dealumination

Dealumination is another cause for deactivation, particularly in
zeolite-catalyzed fast pyrolysis processes [265] , where the catalyst
is subject to both high temperature and water content [367,368] .
Dealumination  results  in  both  Brønsted  and  Lewis  acidic  sites
losses and thus impacts the activity in an irreversible way [265] .
450 °C  was  suggested  as  the  threshold  for  the  dealumination  to
become important [368] and as a result, the zeolite-CFP processes
were recommended to be carried out below 400 °C to make sure
that there is a minimum risk of dealumination [369] . Limiting the
reaction temperature also helps with the economics and operation
2 emissions and environmental foot-
of the process, as well as CO
print. Co-feeding of water could also mitigate strong exotherms oc-
curred as a result of hydrotreatment or other reactions [256] , and
thus dealumination risks.

3.2.4. Catalyst regeneration

Catalyst  regeneration  can  help  to  reduce  the  catalyst  repal-
cement costs and the associated lost time, and thus make the pro-
cess more favorable economically. This would, however, depend on
the main deactivation mechanism and cannot be implemented if
the  deactivation  happens  by  an  irreversible  mechanism  such  as
sintering, dealumination, or sometimes poisoning. For other mech-
anisms though, such as coking, catalyst regeneration can recover
the activity partially, and there are examples of this in the liter-
ature, especially for the zeolite catalysts. It was, however, shown
that  the  deactivation-regeneration  cycles  are  not  fully  reversible

30

and the activity of HZM-5 was gradually reduced by further regen-
eration, and this resulted in higher oxygen content, and lower aro-
matic production [341] when using the regenerated catalyst. There
were also evidences that the regeneration process which is nor-
mally carried out at high temperatures to remove coke, resulted in
dealumination through localized hotspots [321] . Therefore, careful
investigation is required when ‘designing’ a regeneration process.

3.3. Future research directions

Although significant work has been already carried out on the
catalysts used for biomass pyrolysis and upgrading, further study
is  required  to  enhance  the  comprehensive  understanding  of  the
underlying chemical and physical phenomena taking place at the
catalyst scale, as this would help to better design catalysts and to
optimize  the  key  performance  indicators.  Several  potent  lines  of
research are summarized in the following.

3.3.1. Overcoming pyrolysis oil complexities

Currently  most  of  the  literature  work  is  focused  on  model
molecules  such  as  phenol,  anisole,  or  guaiacol  as  catalyst  feed-
stock. Although this approach is useful in understanding the com-
plex reaction network that could occur for any individual molecule
in the feed, the ultimate goal is to develop high-performance cata-
lysts that can be applied practically for a wide range of typical bio-
oils. As the result, further experimental work with more complex
feedstock would be beneficial in understanding the interactions of
different f eed com ponents on the overall performance of the cat-
alysts. These experiments are, however, difficult to carry out in a
repeatable manner, and one approach could be to pre-blend cer-
tain components with a known composition prior to entry to the
catalytic reactor.

3.3.2. Process intensification through multi-functional catalysts

The  development  of  multi-functional  catalysts  with  optimum
activity is a challenging topic. Biomass-derived bio-oil is a complex
mixture of several hundred compounds each requiring a different
upgrading  route  (hydrotreatment,  hydrocracking,  reforming,  etc.).
Currently, commercialized technologies use a mono-functional cat-
alyst acting mostly  on a primary upgrading route, and therefore
are dependent on the overall bio-oil properties. This would typ-
ically  mean  that  further  secondary  upgrading  is  required  to  up-
grade the remainder of the compounds. A multi-functional catalyst
allows improved upgrading to be carried out, minimizing the need
for subsequent processing steps. This would have direct impacts on
the overall upgrading costs as less catalyst and/or reactor volume
would be required, but at the same time would pose new chal-
lenges in terms of the operational flexibility and control resiliency.

3.3.3. Implications of catalyst properties on multi-scale process design
Another aspect that needs further work is the relationship be-
tween different scales/aspects of the process. Most of the existing
studies consider the catalyst design and process design in isolation.
However, catalyst design has profound implications on the main
process economic and environmental indicators. For instance, most
of  the  existing  research  is  focused  on  the  catalyst  performance
without considering its cost. However, a cheaper catalyst with a
slightly inferior performance could be more cost-effective than a
very expensive catalyst with better performance. Similarly, the ef-
fects of the catalyst performance on the overall fixed and operat-
ing costs of an industrial-scale process should be studied simulta-
neously to enable commercialization of the catalytic pyrolysis pro-
cesses.

3.3.4. Hydrogen economy

The hydrogen economy is another topic for research which is
not  well  fully  understood  yet.  Hydrogen  consumption  is  often  a
limitation for most pyrolysis plants not integrated with other hy-
drocarbon  processing  facilities.  H
2  needs  to  be  either  purchased
from external sources or produced onsite, both of which impact
the process economics. As a result, catalysts with a better H
2 econ-
omy are favored. However, no comparative assessment of hydrogen
consumption in catalytic upgrading processes has been carried out
so far.

3.3.5. Catalyst deactivation and regeneration/recycling

Finally, catalyst deactivation is another subject that needs fur-
ther investigation. Most of the existing research has been carried
out for short durations in conditions that may not allow a detailed
analysis  of  the  catalyst  deactivation.  Further  experimentation  is
therefore required to better represent the catalyst performance un-
der realistic conditions. In addition, further characterization tech-
niques (either ex-situ, in-situ , or in operando tools) will help to bet-
ter understand the deactivation phenomena under a wider range of
conditions, and corresponding mitigation methods. Once the deac-
tivation phenomena are understood with a certain degree of confi-
dence, the next step would be to develop quantitative models that
could help to predict the extent of deactivation under a wide set
of conditions. These models could be then incorporated in reactor
models (see Section 6 ), to describe the behavior of the pyrolysis
and upgrading processes more reliably.

Catalyst regeneration and/or recycling also requires further in-
vestigation, as they can improve the process economics. However,
more work needs to be carried out to make sure the regeneration
is carried out before the activity is lost irreversibly. Similarly, the
catalyst recycling at the end-use is another subject that needs to
be  considered.  Catalyst  recycling  is  a  challenging  task  given  the
presence of multiple species on pyrolysis catalysts. However, it can
improve the process economics if the valuable active species can
be separated and recycled efficiently.

4. Bio-oil characterization

Characterization,  in  general,  refers  to  identifying  the  physical
or  chemical  properties  of  different  species.  The  species  of  inter-
est in biomass pyrolysis are chemical compounds present in the
feedstock,  in  the  product  (bio-oil  or  non-condensable  gases),  or
on  the  catalyst.  This  section  reviews  bio-oil  characterization,  as
one of the biggest challenges facing consistent production, blend-
ing, or upgrading of bio-oils is the difficulty in characterizing the
vast mixture of compounds obtained [370] , which are often mixed
with non-converted species from the biomass feed. The liquid oils
obtained from biomass pyrolysis are viscous and heavily colored
(often  dark  red,  brown,  or  black),  in  which  both  their  chemical
composition and  physical properties greatly  vary  with  feedstock,
preparation method, and the age of the sample. The complex bio-
oil mixture is often composed of many different (poly-)oxygenated
hydrocarbons emulsified with varying amounts of water. The com-
pounds present could include aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons
containing carboxylic acid and hydroxyl groups, commonly in the
form of various substituted phenols and furanoics [13,77,370,371] .
The large range of compounds with varying polarity, multiple func-
tional groups, and water emulsion phase complicate this mixture
of lignin [321] and products of thermal and/or catalytic decompo-
sition. The compounds typically cover a molecular weight range of
30–20 0 0 Da, which necessitates the use of a variety of analytical
techniques in tandem for characterization. This section starts with
an  overview  of  the  main  properties  of  the  chemical  compounds
that need to be characterized. How the properties are influenced
by  different  factors  is  also  explained.  The  main  characterization

techniques studied by different researchers are then reviewed, be-
fore proposing new research avenues for future studies.

4.1. Bio-oil physicochemical properties

The main chemical characteristics of interest in bio-oils are the
water  content  and  elemental  composition.  More  specifically,  the
C:H:O ratios are of particular interest for fuel applications, as they
control the heating value of the resulting oil (low O bio-oils are
preferred for this application). As such, the C:H and C:O ratios are
often cited when comparing different bio-oil qualities. In addition,
pH is cited as an indicator of the acidity or corrosivity of the bio-
oils, although there are other indicators such as Total Acid Num-
ber (TAN) as well. Molecular weight is also used to indicate the
degree of thermal breakdown. Physical characteristics such as vis-
cosity and density are also vital for post-pyrolysis processing. The
measurement techniques required to obtain many of these prop-
erties are detailed elsewhere [372] , and Table 4.1 provides a sum-
mary of the main bio-oil physicochemical properties measured as
well as their typical ranges.

4.2. Factors influencing bio-oil properties

While the feedstock type and pyrolysis conditions are the main
influencing factors for bio-oil physicochemical characteristics, the
age  of  the  produced  bio-oil  is  also  important  in  determining
its  quality.  Certain  components  of  the  bio-oils  such  as  aldehy-
des are not generally stable, and reactions can take place within
the  oil  phase  or  oil-water  emulsion,  over  time.  These  reactions,
referred  to  as  secondary-reactions  [372] ,  include  polymerization,
low-temperature cracking, or condensation by oxidative coupling
of phenols [380] , in the case of lignin [381] . Advanced characteri-
zation can, therefore, clarify the nature and extent of the secondary
reactions and enable monitoring the bio-oil evolution with time. In
addition, the characterization techniques can help to establish the
storage conditions and/or immediately required treatments.

4.3. Bio-oil characterization techniques

The  most  common  analytical  tools  used  to  characterize  bio-
oil  include  high-performance  liquid  chromatography  (HPLC)  and
gas  chromatography  (GC)  for  compound  identification  [370,373–
379] , gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and HPLC-Mass Spec-
troscopy  (HPLC-MS)  for  larger  compound  identification,  1 H,  13 C,
and (derivatized) 31 Phosphorus Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ( 31 P-
NMR)  [382–384] ,  Fourier  transform  infrared  spectroscopy  [385] ,

Karl Fischer titration for water content determination, and thermo-
gravimetric analysis [386] . In addition to each technique’s limita-
tions and the range of compounds that they can detect, it could
be challenging to interpret or quantify results when oil yields are
small.

A summary of the main bio-oil characterization techniques is
provided  in  Sections  4.3.1 –4.3.3  below,  with  a  visual  illustration
given in Fig. 4.1 .

4.3.1. One- and two-dimensional chromatographic techniques

Chromatography is the most commonly used technique to de-
termine  the  chemical  composition  of  the  low  molecular  weight
pyrolysis products. Chromatography enables the separation of the
mixture into its individual compounds, which are then identified
qualitatively and/or quantitatively, depending upon the degree of
analysis employed. Historically simple one-dimensional (1D) chro-
matographic techniques (GC and HPLC) have been used based on
the expected physiochemical properties of the sample.

Presence of a large number of compounds in any bio-oil sam-
ple,  some  with  similar  structures  means  that  overlapping  peaks
in 1D chromatograms is a frequent issue, limiting the degree of
obtainable specificity. Two-dimensional (2D) chromatography tech-
niques have, therefore, become more popular for bio-oil character-
ization, as they can identify a larger number of constituents, al-
though for very complex bio-oil samples they might not be able
to  provide  the  full  analysis,  either.  Multi-dimensional,  hyphen-
ated chromatographic and spectrometric techniques ( e.g. GC × GC,
LC × LC, and GC-MS) are more powerful in this case and can pro-
vide  the  quantitative  determination  of  a  wider  range  of  lower
molecular weight compounds. The multi-dimensional pyrolysis gas
chromatography/mass spectroscopy (Py-GC/MS) even allows com-
bined biomass pyrolysis and characterization to take place at the
same time [391] .

GC ×GC  analysis  separates  two  distinct  GC  columns  of  differ-
ent polarity, enabling bio-oil characterization of highly polar and
non-polar compounds simultaneously. It also does not typically re-
quire any pretreatment except dilution in a tetrahydrofuran (THF),
acetone, or methanol solvent [370,387–390] , although some prepa-
ration methods have been suggested in the literature [392–395] .
The  derivatization  is,  for  example,  one  of  these  methods  which
can  overcome  an  existing  GC ×GC  limitations  i.e.  inability  to  de-
tect highly polar compounds such as phenols, alcohols, and acids.
Derivatization techniques [392] convert polar N-H and O-H groups
into relatively nonpolar groups, and the resultant products can be
better analyzed by GC columns. This derivatization is particularly
important for hyphenated GC-MS characterization as many stan-
dard MS and other detector protocols require chemical modifica-

tion. Effective GC ×GC characterization requires a careful selection
of columns (connected to detectors) as well as the modulator that
is placed between the two columns. The modulator is responsible
for  trapping  the  compounds  coming  out  of  the  first  (often  non-
polar  or  with  low  polarity)  column  and  sending  them  into  the
second  (often  polar)  column.  The  most  common  detectors  cou-
pled to GC ×GC for bio-oil analysis include flame ionization detec-
tor (FID) [396] and atomic emission detector (AED) [397] , which
are very sensitive detectors requiring careful model system eval-
uation, as well as detection techniques such as sulfur chemilumi-
nescence detector (SCD) [398] , nitrogen/phosphorus detector (NPD)
[399]  and  time-of-flight  mass  spectrometry  (ToFMS)  [396–400] .
The results of GC ×GC analysis are provided in the form of a three-
dimensional chromatographic output. The primary and secondary
retention times are shown along the horizontal and vertical axes,
while the peaks corresponding to each compound are represented
by color spots or contour lines. An example of this GC ×GC result
visualization,  which  enables  compounds  to  be  grouped  by  func-
tionality and even further clustered by chemical isomers [401] is
shown in Fig. 4.2 .

The division of the chromatographic space by the class of com-
pounds  also  allows  a  fast  estimation  of  the  bio-oil  composition.
An important feature of GC ×GC techniques is the requirement for
careful  calibration  of  peaks,  using  a  large  library  of  compounds.
Given that there are 10 0 - 1,0 0 0 compounds in the GC ×GC chro-
matographs, this can be carried out using either internal or exter-
nal standards, depending on the type of detectors the GC ×GC tech-
nique uses, as well as the compound(s) to be calibrated [370,387–
390,403] . External calibration is often preferred if a specific bio-oil
compound is targeted, whereas internal calibration allows a more
versatile calibration of different compounds.

Once  calibrated,  the  GC ×GC  methods  can  accurately  quantify
the bio-oil composition. This is a significant advantage over other
methods such as spectroscopic techniques which offer a qualitative
analysis only [370,387–390] .

Since not all bio-oil components are volatile to elute through a
GC column or have the low polarity required for GC analysis, 2D
LC is used more frequently for oil analysis [404–407] . 2D LC meth-
ods have been in use for food and pharmaceutical applications and
have potential in analyzing the bio-oil aqueous phase with higher
polarity  compounds  than  those  in  the  organic  phase.  The  aque-
ous phase can contain up to 20% [370,387–390] of organic com-
pounds produced in bio-oil pyrolysis and thus its accurate content
determination is important in process development and design of
the upgrading processes to improve the product quality of certain
fractions. Studies [408–410] showed potentially up to 2,0 0 0 com-
pounds (with different polarities and functional groups such as ke-
tones, furans, alcohols, guaiacol, syringol, lactones, aromatic ether,
and phenols) in the bio-oil aqueous phase can be determined using
LC ×LC technique, although not all the compounds could be quan-
titatively analyzed. 2D LC techniques use two columns connected
in series, each using a different stationary phase, elution solvent,
or separation technique. The sample is pumped into the first col-

umn for the first analysis. A fraction of the effluent is then injected
into the second column where a fast separation often takes place.
Like the gas chromatography, a set of detectors are connected to LC
×LC columns. These can be photo-diode array (PDA) and evapora-
tive light scattering (ELSD) which are used in conventional LC tech-
niques. Alternatively, normal or high-resolution mass spectrome-
ter (HRMS) [411] can be applied. LC ×LC MS, in particular, provides
perhaps  the  most  thorough  bio-oil  characterization/identification
method, currently available [412,413] .

4.3.2. High-resolution mass spectroscopy

Higher molecular weight compounds of the bio-oils have also
been analyzed using standard petroleum-based analyses, such as
Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-
ICRMS)  [414–418]  or  2D-NMR.  The  FT-ICRMS  techniques  have  a
sharp resolution of better than 0.003 Da [370,387–390] and thus
enable analysis of higher molecular weight species derived from
lignin  and  hemicellulose  decomposition  with  molecular  weights
of  up  to  1,0 0 0 Da  [419–421] .  The  technique  is  advantageous  be-
cause it does not require any sample preparation prior to injec-
tion (apart from dilution), is flexible enough to handle the more
polar compounds present in bio-oils, and can be accompanied by
relatively simple MS analyses such as electrospray ionization (ESI)
[422] . Such combined method offers easily translatable results and
comparisons  between  samples  [423] .  FT-ICRMS  is  also  especially
adept at detecting heteroatom-containing species (mostly nitrogen-
containing)  [419,424] .  This  detection  capability  opens  opportuni-
ties  for  feedstock  comparisons,  which  are  of  growing  interest  in
bio-oil production. Furthermore, high-resolution MS techniques are
essential  for  studying  the  efficacy  of  catalytic  upgrading  of  bio-
oils [370,425] which becomes more important as the bio-refining
and in particular deoxygenation [426] and lignin depolymerization
[427] processes develop. MS-based techniques provide the flexibil-
ity of detecting changes in molecular weight and composition of
the  pyrolysis  bio-oil  with  changes  in  operating  conditions  [428] .
Fig.  4.3  provides  an  example  of  the  FT-ICRMS  findings  for  both
a complete bio-oil sample produced via hydrothermal liquefaction
(HTL) and its substituent aqueous fraction. The results show how
the relatively lighter and heavier compounds are distributed in the
aqueous and hydrocarbon phases, respectively.

FT-ICRMS is, however, unable to detect low molecular weight
compounds  which  can  be  better  detected  with  GC  techniques
[430,431] . It is also often expensive and, therefore, cannot be used
on  a  day-to-day  basis.  Other  techniques  such  as  Orbitrap  and
Quadrupole  Time  of  Flight  Mass  Spectroscopy  (Q-ToF  also  called
Q-ToFMS) are more suitable for a routine basis [370,387–390] and
have been already used for bio-oil analysis [432–435] . Both Orbi-
trap  and  Q-ToFMS  offer  a  detectability  window  of  20 0–2,0 0 0 Da
[436–438] , although Q-ToFMS has a significantly simpler working
principle  compared  to  Orbitrap  or  FT-ICRMS  and  thus  is  faster.
This comes at the price of slightly lower accuracy. The accuracy in
fact drops in the following order: FT-ICRMS > Orbitrap > Q-ToFMS
[439,440] . Therefore, depending on the desired level of accuracy,

cost,  and characterization speed, either one or  a  combination of
these techniques can be used.

4.3.3. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy

Although HRMS techniques are useful in providing the molecu-
lar weight of a specific compound, they do not provide the chem-
ical structure and the functional groups. This would be achieved
using  NMR  techniques  which  have  become  increasingly  valuable
tools for bio-oil characterization [370] . Conventional 1D-NMR spec-
troscopy  has  been  widely  used  to  provide  qualitative  and  quan-
titative  information  about  the  functional  groups  and  structures
present  in  bio-oils  [382,4 41–4 43] .  2D-NMR  is  a  more  advanced
technique  which  provides  a  detailed  characterization  of  all  bio-

oil  functional  groups  irrespective  of  molecular  weight  and  col-
lects  spectroscopic  data  in  two  time  scales:  evolution  and  mix-
ing  ( t 1 ),  and  detection  ( t 2 ).  Each  time  domain  is  then  trans-
lated  into  a  frequency-domain  spectrum  using  Fourier  transfor-
mation [4 4 4,4 45] . 2D-NMR has been initially used for lignin and
biomass analysis [4 46–4 49] , but then adapted for bio-oil character-
ization, as it allows several derivatizations to take place for NMR-
based structural analysis. The most notable derivatizations include
phosphitylation  and  subsequent  31 P-NMR  analysis  which  help  to
determine  the  relative  amounts  of  phenolic,  hydroxyls,  hydrox-
yphenyl, guaiacyl, and syringyl structures, derived from lignin and
other functional groups such as primary hydroxyls and carboxylic
acids [450] . 2D-NMR can identify functional group environments

based  on  complex  assignments,  though  the  results  are  not  nor-
mally quantitative [370] . However, Ragauskas has shown that het-
eronuclear single-quantum correlation-nuclear magnetic resonance
(HSQC-NMR), which is one form of 2D-NMR, can give a wide range
of  compounds  in  a  semi-quantitative  form  [382,4 41,4 42] .  This  is
especially useful for identifying phenolics, and polyaromatic com-
pounds as well as carboxylic acids. Another advantage of 1D and
2D NMR techniques is their ability to follow changes in the com-
position of bio-oil either as the mixture ages [441] or as it becomes
upgraded (see Fig. 4.4 for an example of the results) [443] . These
are crucial information that would help with further development
of the pyrolysis and upgrading processes.

4.4. Conclusions and future research directions

The sheer number of compounds present in bio-oils means that
no  single  technique  is  sufficient  for  comprehensive  bio-oil  char-
acterization.  As  such,  a  range  of  techniques  needs  to  be  used
for comparing various samples derived from different feedstocks,
pyrolysis techniques, or  reactor  configurations. For  example,  Mc-
Cormick et al. used a combined method (elemental analysis,  13 C
NMR,  GC-MS,  LC,  and  derivatization)  to  characterize  three  hy-

drotreated  bio-oils  with  different  oxygen  contents  (8.2,  4.9,  and
0.4 w/w)  which  were  fractionated  into  light  naphtha,  jet,  diesel,
and gasoline [451] . This method of combined analysis provides im-
portant  information  on  how  compounds  are  distributed,  and  ul-
timately  where  the  bio-oils  can  be  utilized  most  effectively.  As
new techniques become available, the amount of extracted infor-
mation increases, offering many opportunities for comprehensive
analysis and identification of upgrading approaches and optimiza-
tion of bio-oil quality by improving the process or catalyst param-
eters. Catalyst poisons, as well as pyrolysis and upgrading reaction
mechanisms to provide both desired and undesired products, could
be identified by characterization of bio-oils. Bio-oil characterization
also can reveal important information about bio-oil aging. Charac-
terization techniques also play an important role in environmental
protection. While basic information such as mass or carbon yields
is easily obtainable, only in-depth characterization can reveal the
presence  of  trace  toxic  compounds  which  can  impact  emissions
and health hazards of bio-oils. Trace levels of toxins such as mer-
cury, arsenic, or heavy metals can impact both future applications
of bio-oils and their human or environmental health impacts.

In conclusion, high-resolution characterization of pyrolysis oils
is  essential  for  understanding  reaction  mechanisms  and  kinetics,

Fig. 5.2 , reports the bio-oil compositions obtained from five dif-
ferent sources of biomass under similar pyrolysis conditions [391] .
Transglycosylation of cellulose at 300 °C results in the production
of  levoglucosan  (sugar)  which  is  the  most  abundant  product  in
bio-oils. Levoglucosan can also be produced from cleavage of hemi-
celluloses unit from polysaccharides. Its further fission and dispro-
portionation produce furan and acids. Dehydration of levoglucosan
produces  dianhydro-R-D-glucopyranose.  In  the  presence  of  inor-
ganic salts containing potassium and calcium, cellulose degrades to
hydroxyacetaldehyde which is attributed to glucose fragmentation
rather than depolymerization, as well as levoglucosan. Depolymer-
ization of lignin results in monomethoxy-phenols such as 4-vinyl-
phenol, vanillin, isoeugenol, and guaiacol, dimethoxy fractions such
as  syringol,  4-(1-propenyl)-trans  syringol,  and  sinapaldehyde,  as
well  as  catechols,  namely,  hydroquinone  and  methylbenzenediol.
The biomass resources featuring a high concentration of lignin pro-
duce more phenolic compounds, e.g. catechols, and syringols [391] .

5.1. Fast pyrolysis mechanisms

Developing  kinetic  models  of  biomass  pyrolysis  requires  an
understanding  of  the  mechanisms  of  reactions  involved  in  py-
rolytic decomposition of biomass constituents. Typically, biomass
consists  of  40–50%  cellulose,  25–35%  hemicellulose  and  15–30%
lignin in addition to extractives (tannins, fatty acids, and resins)
and  alkaline  salts  (potassium,  sodium)  [265,391] .  Cellulose  pro-
vides  the  structure  of  cell  walls,  is  mostly  present  in  crys-
talline form in nature [75,256,452] , and is a linear homopolymer
of glucose connected with b-1,4-glycoside linkage. Hemicellulose,
which  has  lower  strength,  is  an  amorphous  polymer  of  various
polymerized  monosaccharides  such  as  D-xylose,  L-arabinose,  D-
galactose, D-glucose, and D-mannose, among which xylose is the
most abundant. Lignin, whose role is to strengthen the lignocellu-
losic structure, contains phenol-containing components such as p-
coumaryl/p-hydroxyphenyl, coniferyl/guaiacyl, and sinapyl/syringyl
alcohol units, which are bounded together with ether and carbon-
carbine bounds in a three-dimensional configuration.

It is widely recognized that the physical and chemical transfor-
mations happening in biomass pyrolysis, can be satisfactorily de-
scribed by the following steps [4,453,454] : First, moisture evapora-
tion and hydrolysis of extractives occur below 200 °C. Then hemi-
cellulose degrades mainly in the range of 220–315 °C, followed by
cellulose pyrolysis at 315–400 °C [14] . Lignin has rigid structures
that are resistant to pyrolytic degradation and hence its pyrolysis
is relatively slow and occurs over a significantly wider temperature
range (160–900 °C); starting before hemicellulose and continuing
beyond cellulose [4,455,456] decomposition. The assumption of in-
dependent thermal degradation of biomass constituents (cellulose,
hemicellulose, and lignin) offers a convenient method to study py-
rolysis  mechanism  at  low  temperatures.  However,  for  high  tem-
peratures i.e. near the gasification regime ( > 800 °C) strong inter-
actions between cellulose and lignin decompositions are observed.
Lignin is reported to reduce char formation and has an inhibiting
effect against decomposition of levoglucosan produced from cellu-
lose. Lignin, however, encourages production of light compounds
from cellulose decomposition. On the other side, cellulose discour-
ages vapor carbonization and char formation from lignin and pro-
motes the formation of guaiacol, 4-methyl-guaiacol, and 4-vinyl-
guaiacol [457] .

5.2. Fast pyrolysis kinetics

Several  parallel  reactions  take  place  in  pyrolysis  reactors,  in-
cluding  dehydration,  depolymerization,  isomerization,  aromatiza-
tion,  decarboxylation,  and  charring  [10,454,458] .  It  is,  therefore,
important  to  have  a  thorough  understanding  of  all  the  reaction

wood basis.

which in turn, helps with macroscopic process modeling, scale-up,
optimization, and commercialization. Based on the analysis, the au-
thors suggest the following directions be pursued in future charac-
terization developments:

1. Establishing  a  quick,  concise,  and  easily  applied  quantifica-
tion method for the characterization techniques especially for
GC ×GC analysis.

2. Seamless  integration  of  complementing  characterization  tech-
niques, so they can cover the full spectrum of pyrolysis oil com-
ponents.

3. Minimizing the preparation time and effort, to limit the degra-
dation of highly unstable components, so that the characteriza-
tion techniques can capture the “actual” behavior of pyrolysis
oils during pyrolysis, upgrading, and aging reactions.

4. Developing predictive techniques with respect to the ultimate

fuel properties such as ignition delay or octane number.

5. Development  of  characterization  strategies  that  can  provide
crucial information for catalytic upgrading of bio-oils, enabling
better catalyst designs.

5. Mechanism and kinetics

Thermal  decomposition  of  biomass  in  the  absence  of  oxygen
generates noncondensable gases, condensable hydrocarbon vapors,
water, and char. The composition and yield of each phase strongly
depend  on  the  reaction  temperature  and  the  residence  time  of
biomass particles, as demonstrated in Fig. 5.1 . In the mildest mode
of  pyrolysis,  torrefaction ,  biomass  is  heated  up  very  slowly  (10–
60 min) at relatively low temperatures and is gradually converted
to a high energy density solid. Decreasing the biomass residence
time by two orders of magnitude and increasing temperature to
450–500 °C results in a higher vapor and bio-oil yields, compared
to solids (aerosols and charcoal), known as slow pyrolysis . Increas-
ing  temperature  and  reducing  residence  time  further  to  the  fast
pyrolysis ranges maximizes bio-oil production. Other factors in im-
proving the liquid yield include limiting the vapor residence time,
rapid removal of char, and immediate quenching to suppress sec-
ondary  reactions,  hence  freezing  the  intermediate  products.  By
comparison, further increases in the temperature to the gasifica-
tion range (750–900 °C) increases secondary reactions and the gas
yield.

rates and transport phenomena in order to better design pyroly-
sis systems. Kinetic studies have been widely carried out for lig-
nocellulosic biomass since the 1980s [459–461] , and have been re-
viewed by White et al. [4] and Papari and Hawboldt [9] . Extensive
research  effort  has  been  focused  on  global  kinetic  model  devel-
opment  using  thermogravimetric  and  scanning  calorimetry  tech-
niques  [14,462–464] .  Most  of  the  proposed  models  estimate  the
pyrolysis kinetics by superposition of decomposition of the three
main biomass components [181,465,466] without considering the
interactions between these components during pyrolysis. Limited
studies attempted to understand the complex interactions between
cellulose,  hemi-cellulose,  and  lignin,  and  hence  no  consensus  is
reached on the effects of such interactions [17,43,467–469] . Lim-
ited kinetic modeling studies have been also performed on algae
biomass pyrolysis [470–472] .

Understanding biomass pyrolysis kinetics often falls under the
broader umbrella of thermal analysis, in which a certain property
of the mixture is monitored over time. Thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) is often the method of choice in which the biomass parti-
cles are heated and the changes in their weight as the result of
decomposition and the release of volatiles is measured as an in-
dicator of the reaction progress. TGA can be conducted at a con-
stant temperature or constant heating rate [4] . Isothermal TGA is
labor intensive and requires a wide range of temperatures to add
predictability.  In  addition,  the  initial  heating-up  period  may  en-
tail  an  important  part  of  the  reaction.  By  comparison,  the  non-
isothermal  method  can  be  programmed  to  expedite  a  range  of
temperatures. Despite their conveniences, both these methods are
sometimes criticized for their limited reproducibility and sensitiv-
ity to experimental noise [4,473] .

Table  5.1  summarizes  the  main  developed  kinetic  models  for
biomass  pyrolysis  so  far.  Representing  pyrolysis  reactions  aggre-

gated  as  a  single-step  irreversible  and  endothermic  global  reac-
tion has found widespread popularity [474] , not only due to sim-
plicity  and  efficiency  in  reproducing  TGA  data  but  also  because
of the cumbersome characterization methods needed for validat-
ing  multi-step  complex  reactions.  The  main  limitation  of  single-
step models is their predicted constant ratio between volatile, con-
densable,  and  char  products  [4] ,  which  does  not  correspond  to
the  experimental  findings.  This  limitation  is  overcome  in  semi-
global models which are based on concurrent first-order reactions
( Fig.  5.3 ).  For  instance,  cellulose  pyrolysis  [474,475]  is suggested
to occur by slightly endothermic polymerization at low tempera-
ture (200–280 °C), resulting in the formation of “anhydrocellulose”
or “active cellulose”. At a higher temperature, further conversion
is predicted to happen by two competing pathways: (1) more en-
dothermic end-group polymerization to produce condensable hy-
drocarbons, and (2) exothermic ring scission to produce char and
volatiles  [476] .  Although  semi-global  models  have  been  success-
fully used for comparison of pyrolysis kinetics under similar con-
ditions, they have limited ability in comparing data under differ-
ent operating conditions [477] . Global kinetic models comprising of
multiple consecutive steps can overcome this issue, although they
also have the issue of amplification of minor discrepancies in the
fitness of initial reactions to the following ones [4] . Furthermore,
characterization  of  intermediate  compounds  with  short  lifetimes
and complex products such as crude bio-oil residue is a challenge
for these models.

A  generalization  to  multi-step  models  is  the  distributed  acti-
vation energy model (DAEM) in which a continuous Gaussian or
Weibull distribution function is considered for the activation en-
ergy. This method is able to deconvolute the simultaneous effect
of parallel reactions and was successfully applied to analyze the
pyrolysis kinetics of various biomass [478–482] .

Where k ( T ) is the rate coefficient at a given temperature T, A is the

Arrhenius-based rate expressions provide a good fit to most of the
pyrolysis data, there have been cases where the fit has not been
good enough [4,483] , especially when the role of non-reactive phe-
nomena such as adsorption, desorption, and diffusion is significant.
The Arrhenius parameters estimated from isothermal TGA data
show  high  reproducibility,  although  assuming  a  constant  kinetic
triplet  is  often  proved  to  be  an  “oversimplification” [4,484] .  By
comparison,  models  based  on  non-isothermal  data  show  depen-
dency on the choice of the heating rate [4,485] . An innovative ap-
proach  is  using  the  iso-conversional  technique,  in  which,  unlike

tants conversion, d α/ dt - where α denotes the reactant(s) concen-

used  only  when  the  non-reactive  phenomena  (diffusion,  adsorp-
tion/desorption)  are  not  the  rate-determining  steps.  The  integral
methods do not have an exact analytical solution and need to be
approximated  using  numerical  methods  [4 87–4 90] ,  whereas  the
differential methods are sensitive to the numerical noise in exper-
imental data [4 91,4 92] .

Fig. 5.3 shows a representative list of kinetic models for cellu-
lose pyrolysis. A common feature for most of these models is the
existence of competing pathways, each producing a different (in-
termediate)  product.  For  instance, the  initial  model  proposed  by
Broido and Nelson [493] involved the formation of “active cellu-
lose” (also known as cellulose with a low Degree of Polymeriza-
tion (DP)) through depolymerization reactions. However, since an
expected accelerating pattern of weight loss was not observed at
higher  pyrolysis  temperatures  ( > 295 °C),  this  intermediate  prod-
uct was omitted from the modified model of Bradbury et al. [459] .
Active cellulose formation was also excluded from the model pro-
posed by Banyasz et al. [494] and Varhegyi et al. [181] . However,
by the emergence of new analytical chemistry techniques such as
solid-state cross-polarization magic angle spinning carbon-13 nu-
clear  magnetic  resonance  (CPMAS  13 C  NMR),  the  existence  of  at
least three forms of crystalline cellulose [495] , low DP amorphous
cellulose,  and  disordered  carbohydrate  was  characterized  [496] .
Among primary volatiles, anhydrosugars such as levoglucosan form
the dominant products, which may also be converted to secondary
char  (through  water-catalyzed  repolymerization  [4 97,4 98] ).  It  is
notable that as new models evolve, more details on transport phe-
nomena and the existence of  inhibition and autocatalysis effects
are  taken  into  consideration  (examples  of  this  include  Lewellen
et al.’s [498] and Mamleev et al.’s [499] models).

Exhaustive review of the kinetics models of bio-oil upgrading
is not in the scope of the present publication, but was presented
elsewhere [171] . The key challenge in developing high fidelity pre-
dictive kinetic models for upgrading reactions such as hydrodeoxy-
genation and hydrothermal upgrading is characterization of highly
complex reaction media, including hundreds of species. Recently,
Sharifzadeh et al. [171] proposed a novel framework for modeling
the short residence time hydrothermal upgrading of pyrolysis oil
under near critical conditions. The idea is shown in Fig. 5.4 . In the
proposed kinetic framework, the components are lumped accord-
ing the type of the connectivity of oxygen atoms. Five major groups
of aliphatic, condensed phenolic, carboxylic, phenolic and guaiacyl
OH groups were detected by 31 P-NMR characterization technique.
The 31 P-NMR silent compounds were lumped in a separate group
to enable mass balance calculations. A superstructure of all possi-
ble interconversion reactions was then optimized, which showed a
high degree of fitness to the experimental data.

6. Modeling

Modeling and simulation play a key  role in the development
and  commercialization  of  biofuel  technologies.  A  high  fidelity
multi-scale model with predictive capabilities helps to develop re-
liable and scalable technology, evaluate designs and operating con-
ditions,  reduce  design  time  and  production  costs,  mitigate  risks,
train personnel, do sensitivity analysis, improve productivity and
efficiency  and  real-time  monitoring  and  optimization  of  biofuel
processes [508,509] . Moreover, high fidelity models offer integra-
tion with experimental studies, and reduce the waste of resources
and time and improve the quality of experimental results [510] .

This section reviews the predictive models for pyrolysis reac-
tors,  their  merits  and  limitations,  and  promising  research  areas.
Different  modeling  techniques  are  first  described  in  Section  6.1 .
Different  tools  and  software  that  can  be  utilized  to  perform  a
modeling study are then introduced in Section 6.2 . Biomass par-
ticle modeling and different reactor models are then discussed in

Sections 6.3 and 6.4 , receptively. Finally, some future research di-
rections are proposed in Section 6.5 .

6.1. Modeling techniques: from full-space to lean modeling

Broadly speaking, mechanistic and empirical modeling are the
two main applied approaches [511] . In mechanistic modeling, also
known as systems analytic modeling, the features of the system
are considered using first principles and based on an understand-
ing of the behavior of the system’s components. By comparison,
empirical models are often of input-output nature and are based
on  direct  observation,  measurement,  and  extensive  data  acquisi-
tion. Empirical models are useful to interpolate a specific property
but  are  not  appropriate  for  prediction  and  extrapolation.  There-
fore, in this section of the paper, we mainly focus on the mech-
anistic models. An example of a fluidized bed pyrolysis reactor is
shown in Fig. 6.1 . Modeling this system requires an understanding
of the mass, heat, and momentum transfer phenomena and their
interactions, as the biomass particles undergo pyrolysis reactions,
shrink in size and change in shape and density. Additional com-
plications arise from the aerodynamics of the fluidizing carrier gas
and the collision of sand and biomass particles. A model contain-
ing all these phenomena is often called a full-physical model [512] .
Developing full-physical models often requires the following steps:

1. Establishing  assumptions  and  definitions  regarding  steady-
state or dynamic behaviors, the model dimensions (1D, 2D, 3D),
and the shape of the (biomass, sand, and catalyst) particles.

2. Developing conservation differential equations:

a. Mass balances:

i. Reaction  kinetics  which  depends  on

the  non-
catalytic/catalytic nature of the reactor (see Section 3.1 ),
and

ii. Deactivation terms in the case of catalytic reactors (see

Section 3.2 )
b. Energy balance.

3. Developing algebraic equations to predict or calculate the re-
quired thermophysical properties used in the differential equa-
tions described in step (ii) such as the aerodynamic properties
of  the  reaction  media,  molecular  weights  and  density  of  dif-
ferent materials, fluids viscosity, enthalpy, heat of desorption,
thermal conductivity, mass and heat transfer coefficients, and
diffusivities.

4. Establishing boundary conditions which link the reaction me-
dia  and  the  surroundings  ( i.e.  reactor  walls,  inlet,  and  outlet
surfaces).

5. Numerical solution and model implementation to solve the
algebraic and (partial) differential equations. Methods such as
the  Crank-Nicolson  [513–515] ,  the  Runge–Kutta  [516] ,  or  the
Gear’s [517,518] methods can be applied.

A full-physical model for biomass pyrolysis often considers the
spatial-temporal distribution of temperature, pressure, and concen-
trations, as well as the size distribution of particles, across the re-
actor. The biomass particles can have a known size/position dis-
tribution (i.e., the Lagrangian approach) or be regarded as a con-
tinuum media ( i.e. the Eulerian approach). The environment (car-
rier gas, fluidized sand particles, catalyst particles, or reactor wall)
properties are inputted to the model. The single particle conversion
is determined based on the presence and type of the catalyst in
a reactor. The fluidization regime and average gas/solid residence
time then translated this to the overall conversion [520] .

To  minimize  computational  costs,  researchers  often  simplify
models  by  lumping  certain  parameters  or  assuming  equilibrium
conditions [521–524] . Such simplifications may impact predictions
as  for  instance,  equilibrium  state  cannot  be  achieved  in  non-
catalytic  reactors,  or  as  explained  in  Section  3 ,  certain  catalysts

sidered.

include thermodynamic properties of chemical components [556–
558] to model reactors and unit operations [559] , albeit with lower
predictive capabilities.

6.2. Implementation procedures

From  the  implementation  viewpoint,  computational  fluid  dy-
namics  (CFD)  is  the  main  choice  for  full-physical  modeling.  The
CFD approach can predict the fluid flow behavior, heat and mass
transfer, chemical reactions, phase changes, and mechanical move-
ment [525] , from 1D to 3D. The computational cost increases with
increasing complexity and adding new dimensions. As a result, 3D
models are often too complex to be practical for large-scale reactor
modeling or fine-tuning operating parameters. The required level
of complexity is often assessed by evaluating the error, introduced
by simplifying assumptions and choosing a reasonable balance be-
tween accuracy and computational costs [526] .

Different CFD software packages (ANSYS Fluent ®, MFiX Multi-
phase Flow with Interphase eXchanges, ANSYS Polyflow ®, COMSOL
Multiphysics ®, OpenFOAM ®, etc.) can be used to perform the CFD
studies of pyrolysis systems. ANSYS Fluent ® is widely used in solv-
ing the governing equations including the fluid flows, heat/mass
transfer, and chemical reactions with additional options for user-
defined  functions  (UDF)  [527,528] .  van  der  Hoef  et  al.  [529]  re-
viewed different CFD models used for fluidized bed reactors ac-
cording  to  the  underlying  assumptions for  gas  and  solid  phases.
Gómez-Barea and Leckner [530] reviewed gasification fluidized bed
reactors based on the reactor type, pyrolysis rate (slow or fast), and
solution  approaches  (Euler-Euler,  Euler-Lagrange,  and  representa-
tive particle model). Rostami et al. [531] incorporated a Distributed
Activation Energy Model (DAEM) in a CFD code to predict the evo-
lution  rate  and  the  yield  of  volatiles  from  pyrolysis  of  cellulose,
charcoal, and a tobacco sample.

The  quasi-continuous  assumption  is  widely  used  in  model-
ing  fast  pyrolysis  reactors,  where  the  gas  and  solid  phases  are
treated  as  continuous  phases  [532–535] .  This  method  provides
a  suitable  explanation  of  mass  loss  for  thin  biomass  particles
in  which  the  temperature  gradient  and  species  concentrations
across the biomass particles are negligible. However, the temper-
ature/concentration gradients across the biomass or catalyst parti-
cles should be considered in modeling thick biomass particles in
slow pyrolysis [536] or catalytic pyrolysis and upgrading. Momen-
tum transfer is often simplified in Euler-Euler models using Darcy’s
law [532] . Although the Euler-Euler method is widely used for slow
pyrolysis reactor modeling, the Euler-Lagrange method, or Discrete
Particle or Discrete Elements Methods (DPM or DEM) offer alterna-
tive solution strategies. Here, the gas and solid (particle) phases are
treated as continuum (Eulerian assumption), and size/position dis-
tributed (Lagrangian assumption) mediums, respectively. The Euler-
Lagrange method is, therefore, more computationally expensive as
the model needs to be solved for each particle. The so-called repre-
sentative particle model (RPM) [536] offers a com promise in which
an intra-particle model is solved for each finite volume element in
the reactor, and is, therefore, less computationally expensive.

While CFD models provide detailed insight into the design and
operation of pyrolysis reactors, simpler models can be developed
based on lumped modeling. AspenTech ® modules such as Aspen
Plus ® or  Aspen  HYSYS ® were  proved  to  be  efficient  for  process
flowsheeting and ensuring plant-wide mass and energy balances
[31,35,509,537,538] . The rich library of these tools allows model-
ing of different catalytic/non-catalytic reactors with different feed-
stocks [34,539–548] .

In  addition  to  these  methods,  data-driven  models  such  as
artificial  neural  networks  (ANNs),  genetic  programming  (GP),
fuzzy  logic,  and  adaptive  neuro-fuzzy  inference  system  (ANFIS)
[549]  have  been  in  the  literature  in  addition  to  black-box  mod-
eling methods [550–555] . Black-box models are quite diverse and

6.3. Biomass particle modeling

A good particle flow model is required to predict the particle
residence time and the heat transfer into the particle which are
determinant factors for the reaction extent [560] . The mass trans-
fer into and out of particles is also important in predicting water
evaporation and diffusion of products from the particle core to the
surface and then to the gas phase. Different shapes are assumed in
the biomass particle modeling including cylindrical, spherical, and
flat plate shapes for wood pyrolysis [561,562] which then deter-
mine the dimensions (1D, 2D, and 3D) and the coordinates consid-
ered (see Fig. 6.2 ).

Chan  et  al.  [563]  modeled  devolatilization  rates  and  prod-
uct  compositions  of  a  single  biomass  particle.  They  found  that
diffusion  mass  transfer  is  less  limiting  than  hydrodynamic  flow.
Alves  and  Figueiredo  [513]  studied  pyrolysis  of  biomass  parti-
cles  using  a  simplified  1D  drying  model  that  was  controlled  by
heat supply, neglecting bounded water diffusion, air-water diffu-
sion, free water movement, and pressure gradient inside the solid.
Koufopanos  et  al.  [564]  coupled  heat  transfer  with  chemical  ki-
netics and fitted linear equations using experimental data to pre-
dict  the  required  properties  in  the  model  as  a  function  of  tem-
perature and conversion. They also considered endothermic reac-
tions at low conversions and exothermic reactions at high conver-
sions. Di Blasi [565] modeled biomass particles as a porous me-
dia and accounted for convection and radiation heat transfers in
the model. He [566] later improved his model by adding the par-
ticle size distribution and investigated the impact of the change in
particle size, the intensity of the radiative heat flux, and orienta-
tion of the anisotropic wood grain relative to the one-dimensional
heat flux, on the pyrolysis rate. He also [567] modeled pyrolysis of
anisotropic lignocellulosic components using a 2D dynamic model
with three heat transfer mechanisms, and the diffusion and con-
vection  of  volatile  species.  The  dynamics  of  particle  degradation
were found to be affected considerably by the solid grain struc-
ture, in both 1D and 2D models. Janse et al. [561] investigated the
impact of chemical and physical parameters on the bio-oil yield
from a cylindrical wood particle. They found that the direction (en-
dothermic vs. exothermic) and magnitude of the pyrolysis heat of
reaction  has  a  significant  effect  on  the  particle  conversion  time.
They also suggested that for a flash pyrolysis model, the internal
mass transfer might not be as important as the reaction kinetics
and heat transfer.

2 and O

Di  Blasi  et  al.  [568]  investigated  different  types  of  woody
biomass with respect to degradation characteristics, product yields,
and  gas  compositions.  The  authors  reported  that  a  higher  min-
imum  heat  flux  is  required  for  softwood  pyrolysis,  but  af-
ter  the  start  of  the  devolatilization  process,  macroscopic  differ-
ences  among  the  different  woods  are  insignificant.  Diego  et  al.
[569] studied the drying and devolatilization process of pinewood
particles of regular and irregular forms in a fluidized bed by mea-
2 concentrations after the complete combustion
suring CO
of the volatiles, and visual observation of flame. They then devel-
oped a model which showed that the devolatilization times and
the  evolution  rates  of  volatiles  of  non-spherical  pinewood  parti-
cles of different sizes were nearly identical when these particles
had the same value of equivalent particle diameter multiplied by
the shape factor. Consequently, they suggested that the models de-
veloped for spherical wood particles can also predict the behavior
of  non-spherical  wood  particles.  Bryden  et  al.  [570]  presented  a
model for pyrolysis of a moist shrinking biomass particle to study
the change of the moisture content at a constant external temper-

ature using different particle thicknesses, temperatures, moisture
amount, and shrinking factors. Having considered three pyrolysis
regimes namely, thermally thin pyrolysis (Biot number (Bi) < 0.2),
thermally thick pyrolysis (0.2 < Bi < 10), and thermal wave pyrol-
ysis (Bi > 10), they found that the pyrolysis regime is affecting the
moisture  amount  and  shrinkage  rate  significantly.  Finally,  it  was
found  that  when  the  interactions  between  the  moisture  content
and the shrinkage are considered, higher tar and reduced light hy-
drocarbon yields are predicted compared to when this interaction
is neglected.

In another study [571] , the shrinkage was shown to have a neg-
ligible effect in thermally thin and thick pyrolysis regimes, while in
the thermal wave pyrolysis regime it affected pyrolysis time and
products. Peters and Bruch [572] worked on the thermal decom-
position of large wood particles in drying and pyrolysis and pre-
dicted  that  the  drying  is  limited  by  heat  transfer in  large  wood
particles. Galgano and Blasi [573] used an unreacted core shrink-
ing approximation to model one-dimensional transport phenom-
ena and finite rate kinetics of thick wood pyrolysis. They suggested
that  convective  heat  transfer  has  a  significant  influence  on  par-
ticle  heating  rate  and  conversion  time.  In  their  next  study,  they
[574] added the effects of moisture evaporation to their model and
validated that using published literature data. Yuen et al. [575] de-
veloped  a  three-dimensional  model  for  wet  wood  pyrolysis,  ac-
counting for moisture evaporation, anisotropic and variable prop-
erties, and pressure-driven internal convection of gases. They ex-
amined different initial moisture content under different furnace
temperatures and discussed the effects of anisotropic properties on
transport phenomena. Shen et al. [576] presented a 1D model to
investigate the effect of heat flux, species, and moisture content
on the pyrolysis of wet wood. Sadhukhan et al. [577] developed a
model for a single particle using fully transient analysis involving
a kinetic model coupled with heat transfer. The authors utilized a
Runge–Kutta–Gill method and FORTRAN ® to solve the formulation.
Damartzis  et  al.  [578]  studied  pyrolysis  of  a  single  spherical
biomass particle in an ablative reactor. They included the effects
of  the  radial distribution  of the  products  and reactants, and the
effect of the porosity on the biomass thermochemical properties,
by considering the char heat capacity in the particle energy bal-
ance. Sreekanth and Kolar [579] presented a 2D model to evaluate
the shrinkage and heat generation during drying and devolatiliza-
tion of a cylindrical wood particle. Ratte et al. [580] focused on
the  mathematical  modeling  of  a  single  particle  in  slow  pyroly-
sis of wood waste using volume averaging throughout the wood
[581] to explain the complex transport phenomena and considered
the porous wood media as a continuum. Lu et al. [562] presented
experimental drying, heating, and conversion rates for sawdust of
different shapes in an entrained-flow reactor, and for large Poplar
particles in a single particle reactor. In addition, the authors devel-
oped a one-dimensional unsteady-state single particle model that
predicted the experimental data satisfactorily. They concluded that
the pyrolysis process is dominated by heat transfer instead of ki-
netics and demonstrated that shape and size have significant ef-
fects on conversion time, particularly for large particles.

Peters [582] considered different boundary conditions in a one-
dimensional model to predict the pyrolysis of different biomasses,
by accounting for various resolution and reaction kinetics.

Selected  studies  on  particle  modeling  are  summarized  in
Table  6.1  including  the  type  of  particle  considered ,  the  main
model  features,  and  their  objectives.  Most  of  the  models  stud-
ied wood particles with limited models focused on other biomass
types. In addition, most of the particle modeling studies are one-
dimensional (small particles).

6.4. Reactor modeling

Available  mathematical  models  for  pyrolysis  reactors,  broadly
classified as fast and slow pyrolysis [583] , are reviewed in the fol-
lowing sub-sections.

6.4.1. Slow pyrolysis

The  main  characteristics  of  slow  pyrolysis  are  slow  heating
rates,  moderate  temperatures,  and  long  residence  time  of  the
volatiles in the bed, which often lead to an increased char yield
[584] . In general, fixed bed reactors, screw reactors, and rotary kiln
reactors are considered for slow pyrolysis.

6.4.1.1. Fixed bed reactors.  Wurzenberger [585] developed a model
for single particles in a fixed bed reactor and solved mass, momen-
tum and energy balances for the entire system. Drying and primary
pyrolysis were described using an equilibrium approach, and inde-
pendent parallel reactions, respectively. Secondary tar cracking, ho-
mogeneous gas reactions, and heterogeneous char reactions were
modeled using kinetic data from the literature. Peters [586] con-
sidered a different approach to model biomass conversion by con-
sidering a finite number of particles inside a fixed bed reactor with
different properties and sizes using 1D transport equations. They
also  considered  a  sequence of  processes  namely  heating,  drying,
and pyrolysis. Later, a 1D model was also developed by Peters et al.
[587]  for  a  packed  bed  pyrolysis  reactor  using  a  Euler-Lagrange
method for particle level phenomena. Ravi et al. [588] presented a
simple and semi-empirical model for sawdust pyrolysis in a fixed
bed reactor by annular shape. They considered conduction as the
dominant  heat  transfer  mechanism,  estimating  the  thermal  con-
ductivity of the packed sawdust bed experimentally, and assumed
a pseudo-first-order kinetic model for pyrolysis reactions. Using a
sensitivity analysis, they concluded that the predictions might be
improved by considering the volatiles flow in the void space of the
char bed, and secondary pyrolysis of volatiles in the bed.

Di Blasi et al. [532] developed a pilot scale horizontal cylindri-
cal reactor and its model for straw pyrolysis. They reported that
the most important parameter to achieve a high straw conversion
to  volatiles  and  char  is  the  solid  residence  time.  Thunman  and
Leckner [589] presented a 1D model for a fixed bed reactor with
equally-sized particles of arbitrary shapes, with a separate particle
model for thick particles. Yang et al. [533] modeled a slow-heating
packed bed reactor with three biomass waste types and found that
wood has a higher tar cracking compared to cardboard and tex-
tile wastes. Johansson et al. [590] investigated the effects of intra-

proposing a new screw design. Berson and Hanley [594] utilized
CFD modeling to compare the performance of different designs of a
pre-treatment screw conveyor reactor, proposing a modified design
with  satisfactory  plug  flow  within  the  reactor.  In  another  study
[595] , accurate flow patterns were obtained over a wide range of
viscosities and pressure distributions, which was proved to affect
reaction rates. Zhu et al. [596] simulated the fluid flow in a hori-
zontal screw decanter centrifuge as well as the solid concentration
distribution. They [597] reported that the 3D unsteady computa-
tion with a moving mesh is effective in studying the solid concen-
tration distributions in a fast pyrolysis screw reactor.

6.4.1.3. Rotary  kiln  reactor.  Klose  and  Wiest  [598]  developed  a
steady-state one-dimensional quasi-continuous pyrolysis model of
a  rotary  kiln  reactor  and  reported  that  pyrolysis  temperature
and space velocity have significant effects on product yields, but
the  solids  residence  time  has  a  negligible  effect,  because  of  the
slow pyrolysis regime. Descoins et al. [586,599] showed that the
biomass particles movement inside the rotary kiln reactor can be
modeled by granular flow theory. Babler et al. [600] developed a
model that included mass and energy balances, pyrolysis reaction,
heat transfer, and granular flow inside the kiln, and compared the
results with experimental data using nine pilot plant trials at dif-
ferent feed and heating rates.

6.4.2. Fast pyrolysis

High heat transfer rate to the particles, rapid removal of pri-
mary products, and biomass feed composition are critical parame-
ters in fast pyrolysis that lead to reduced char and increased liquid
products yields [13,145] . Fast pyrolysis is often conducted at about
500 °C using the following reactors:

1. Fluidized bed reactors: bubbling and circulating
2. Entrained flow reactors
3. Rotating cone reactors
4. Downer reactors
5. Ablative reactors: vortex and rotating blade

In  the  reactor  types  (1)  and  (2),  small  particles  are  used  to
enhance heating rates across the particles and suppress the sec-
ondary char formation reactions [145] . Ablative reactors, in com-
parison, do not need low particle sizes as heat is transferred from
the reactor walls [601] . Fluidized bed reactors are modeled more
than other reactors in the literature.

6.4.2.1. Fluidized bed reactors.  As discussed in Section 2.2.2 , circu-
lating and bubbling fluidized beds reactors have found widespread
application in fast pyrolysis [145,602] . Liden et al. [603] developed
a simple fluidized bed pyrolysis reactor model assuming steady-
state operation, minor temperature gradients in the reactor, uni-
form particle concentrations within the reactor, and single mean
value approximation for the biomass particle residence time.

Felice et al. [604] developed a simple model for single biomass
particle devolatilization first at high temperatures, and then in a
fluidized bed reactor, in which attention was paid to heat trans-
fer,  particle  mixing  and  elutriation,  and  gas  production.  Di  Blasi
[605]  coupled  a  mathematical  model  for  intra-particle  transport

phenomena  and  chemical  reactions  with  an  external  heat  trans-
fer model, taking into account fluid-bed hydrodynamics, in order
to predict the fast pyrolysis characteristics of cellulosic biomass in
a fluidized bed reactor. Lathouwers and Bellan [606] presented a
comprehensive model to predict the thermo-fluid dynamics of a
dense  reacting  gas-solid  mixture,  using  separate  transport  equa-
tions for each particle class and a Euler-Euler approach in a lab-
scale fluidized bed reactor. They concluded that the temperature
of  the  fluidization  gas  is  the  most  important  parameter  in  de-
termining  the  tar  yield,  given  a  fixed  particle  size.  In  another
study [607] , the authors applied their model to optimize and scale
up a biomass pyrolysis in a fluidized bed reactor. Di Blasi et al.
[608] coupled a detailed single-particle model, including a descrip-
tion  of  transport  phenomena  and  a  global  reaction  mechanism,
with  a  plug-flow  assumption  for  extra  particle  processes  of  tar
cracking  in  the  fast  pyrolysis  of  wood  in  a  fluidized  bed  reac-
tor and examined the effects of size, shape, and shrinkage rate of
wood particles, and external heat transfer conditions on the model.
Jand and Foscolo [609] developed a semi-empirical model, to ac-
count for chemical reactions, and heat and mass transfer phenom-
ena, for the devolatilization step of wood pyrolysis in a fluidized
bed reactor. The global wood conversion was described in terms
of a single apparent activation energy and a Euler-Euler exponen-
tial  factor  that  varied  with  biomass  size.  Luo  et  al.  [610]  mod-
eled the effects of the main operating parameters on wood flash
pyrolysis product distribution in a fluidized bed. They suggested
that  the  reaction  temperature  plays  a  major  role  and  maximum
pyrolysis  oil  is  produced  at  a  bed  temperature  of  about  500 °C.
Saastamoinen [611] presented a devolatilization model for fluidized
bed conditions using different biomass feeds with varying parti-
cle  size,  moisture,  reactivity,  and  shape;  which  can  be  incorpo-
rated in a CFD sub-model. De Velden et al. [612] proposed a model
to  predict  the  oil,  gas,  and  char  yields  as  a  function  of  operat-
ing parameters in a circulating fluidized bed. Kaushal and Abedi
[613] developed a one-dimensional model using a two-step kinet-
ics and a two-phase (bubble and emulsion phases) hydrodynamic
model for a biomass pyrolysis fluidized bed reactor. They reported
that cracking and gas-phase reactions are significant beyond 500 °C
and the bed hydrodynamics and mass transfer govern the pyrol-
ysis rate at these high temperatures. Papadikis et al. [614] mod-
eled the momentum transport of a 150 g/h fluidized bed reactor in
two and three dimensions using a Euler-Euler approach and drag
forces. The model equations were incorporated into a FLUENT ® 6.2
code by a UDF. In part B of their study, they [615] modeled heat,
momentum, and mass transports from the fluidizing gas and flu-
idized sand, again using a Eulerian approach. They found that the
model could predict the residence time of vapors and biomass par-
ticles, as well as the pyrolysis particles properties properly since
the  model  accounted  for  particles  degradation  with  an  immedi-
ate  effect  on  their  trajectories  inside  the  reactor.  The  impact  of
shrinkage  on  biomass  pyrolysis  was  simulated  in  another  study
[616] .  Two  different  shrinkage  parameters  were  considered;  one
being equal to the volume left by the solid devolatilization, and the
other being approximately half of the particle volume. The shrink-
age did not have a significant effect on the momentum transport
from the bubbling bed to biomass particles at bigger particle sizes
(500 μm), whilst the effect became more important when the par-
ticles were closer to total disintegration. The effect of shrinkage on
the product yields or the pyrolysis time of thermally thin particles
was insignificant. Oevermann et al. [617] used a Euler-Lagrange ap-
proach to model wood gasification in a bubbling fluidized bed, us-
ing 2D Navier-Stokes equations and a DEM to model gas and solid
phases, respectively. Char was used as the bed material in a bub-
bling fluidized bed reactor CFD modeling [618] . The authors con-
sidered a Eulerian multiphase approach for modeling wood gasifi-
cation and investigated the effect of initial bed height, wood feed-

ing  rate,  reactor  throughput,  and  modeling  parameters  (thermal
boundary conditions, primary pyrolysis kinetics, and secondary py-
rolysis model) on product gas concentrations and temperature. The
effect of the operating conditions on the main product gas com-
ponents  was  reported  to  be  insignificant.  The  main  product  gas
components,  (CO  and  CO
2 )  were  found  sensitive  to  the  thermal
boundary  condition.  Furthermore,  a  very  strong  influence  of  op-
erating conditions and model parameters on the tar content was
observed. Papadikis et al. [619] investigated the implication of dif-
ferent drag models on particle trajectory, heat transfer, degrada-
tion rate, product yields, and char residence time in a CFD model
of wood (both cellulose and bagasse) fast pyrolysis in a bubbling
fluidized bed reactor. The impact of different particle sizes on heat
transfer rate inside a fluidized bed reactor was investigated in an-
other study [620] . The authors assumed conductive heat transfer
for the larger biomass particle (550 μm) and neglected biomass–
sand contacts for the smaller biomass particle (350 μm). They re-
ported  that  different  particle  sizes  affect  the  heat  transfer  coef-
ficient considerably, resulting in different temperature profiles at
the surfaces and centers of the biomass particles. In addition, the
final  product  yields  depended  on  the  particle  residence  time  in
the reactor. The dynamics, particle heating and reaction, char for-
mation, elutriation, and spatial distribution of tar and gas inside
the  reactor  were  also  investigated  [621] .  Xue  et  al.  [622]  devel-
oped a Euler–Euler multiphase CFD model, coupled with a parti-
cle pyrolysis model for gas-particle flow and found that biomass
particle size and superficial gas velocity considerably influence tar
yield and biomass residence time at a given bed height. The plot
of biomass decomposition against temperature illustrated that the
optimal temperature for bio-oil production was about 500 °C.

Bruchmüller  et  al.  [623]  developed  a  3D  CFD  model  using  a
Euler–Lagrange approach in a fluidized bed reactor. They reported
that  the  biomass  degradation  reactions  are  influenced  by  local
flow,  particle  properties,  and  the  superficial  fluidization  velocity,
while the particle moisture content is less significant for the final
bio-oil yield. Boateng and Mtui [624] modeled the unsteady consti-
tutive transport equations for inert gas flow and decomposition ki-
netics of biomass pyrolysis using a Euler-Euler approach and a CFD
model. The authors studied the spontaneous emergence of pyrol-
ysis vapors, char, and non-condensable (permanent) gases, as the
kinetics were fast, and bio-oil vapor evolution was accomplished
within a few seconds, occupying two-thirds of the reactor volume,
confirming what was widely reported in the literature.

Trendewicz  et  al.  [519]  integrated  a  one-dimensional  steady-
state biomass fast pyrolysis reactor CFD model with a biomass py-
rolysis  plant model.  Their  model  considered products  speciation,
and particle velocity was computed from a solid–gas momentum
balance  instead  of  empirical  correlations.  In  addition,  they  used
average reaction temperatures, computed from an energy balance
and validated their results with experimental data from the litera-
ture.

Mellin et al. [625] worked on a 3D CFD model of a fluidized bed
reactor and considered a complex reaction scheme for liquid, char,
and gas (levoglucosan) as the products, as well as the fluid dynam-
ics, and heat and momentum transfers of three Eulerian phases.
The pyrolysis products included reference species that reflected the
bio-oil composition and gas/char fractions. Thermal cracking of tar
compounds was also considered and the final compositions were
compared with experimental yields.

A multi-fluid CFD model was used by Sharma et al. [626] to
study  a  bubbling  fluidized  bed  pyrolysis  reactor.  The  model-
ing  results  were  analyzed  in  terms  of  the  distribution  of  non-
condensable gases, biomass, biochar, and the bed material in the
reactor. The effect of operating conditions (temperature, superficial
gas velocity, and biomass particle size) on the product yield was
also studied. Aramideh et al. [627] modeled fast pyrolysis in flu-

idized bed and auger reactors. The compositions of all phases were
modeled  as  interpenetrating  continua  using  a  multi-fluid  model.
Chemical reactions were simulated based on a multi-step reaction
mechanism with multiple compounds in the biomass and the gas
phases.  The  average  residence  time  of  the  materials  in  the  flu-
idized bed reactor was then calculated to estimate the final prod-
uct yields. They found that the tar yield decreased with an increase
in the pre-treatment temperature. It was also found that increased
inlet nitrogen and biomass flows led to increased and reduced tar
yields, respectively.

Ranganathan and Gu [628] investigated the effects of particle
density/size, and gas velocity using a Euler-Euler fluidized bed re-
actor CFD model with different hydrodynamic and kinetic schemes.
Their calculated product yields were then compared with experi-
mental data and a parametric study was carried out to find the ef-
fect of biomass particle type, size, and temperature on the product
yields.

Xiong et al. [629] combined a CFD model of a lab-scale bub-
bling fluidized-bed reactor for biomass fast pyrolysis with a global
multi-component,  multi-step  reaction  kinetics  scheme  to  predict
mean tar yields at the reactor output for different bubbling bed hy-
drodynamics. Increasing fluidizing gas flow and static bed height,
and decreasing the bed particle size were found to increase the
tar yield. In another study [630] , a lab-scale bubbling bed biomass
pyrolysis  reactor  with  a  DAEM  was  coupled  with  CFD.  The  re-
actor operating conditions, kinetics, and multiphase flow dynam-
ics were found to impact the reactor performance. DAEM kinetics
were compared with single-valued activation energy kinetics and
found to be more accurate.

Daw  et  al.  [631]  investigated  the  biomass  particle  residence
time distribution in fluidized bed reactors. They characterized sim-
ple reactor approximations that can be applied to guide, interpret,
and correlate lab and pilot-scale pyrolysis experiments.

6.4.2.2. Entrained  flow  reactors.  Gorton  et  al.  [632]  incorporated
gas and particle temperature profiles in their entrained flow  re-
actor model. They obtained the true particle residence time from
particle velocity as a function of position within the reactor. The
reactor  was  modeled  using  three  first-order  ordinary  differen-
tial  equations  to  study  energy,  biomass  pyrolysis,  and  produc-
tion/decomposition  of  the  oil  vapors.  They  used  the  experimen-
tal data obtained from their previous study [633] to validate the
model and predicted an oil yield of 60% although the maximum
experimental oil yield was 51%.

Brown  et  al.  [634]  simulated  a  laminar  entrained  flow  re-
actor  using  Navier-Stokes  equations  to  predict  reactants’  time-
temperature  profiles,  and  to  better  understand  the  internal  pro-
cesses  in  the  reactor  such  as  particle  devolatilization  which  de-
pends on the trade-off between heat transfer and kinetic control
of the pyrolysis rate. They found that for cellulose particles size of
about 50 μm, pyrolysis rate is kinetically controlled. Another CFD
modeling  of  an  entrained  flow  pyrolysis  reactor  was  Lagrangian
for  particles  and  Eulerian  for  gases  [635]  and  included  biomass
thermal degradation to char with simultaneous evolution of gases
and tars from discrete biomass particles, as well as a two-stage,
semi-global kinetic model. The convective heat transfer to the sur-
face  of  the  particle  was  computed  using  the  Ranz-Marshall  cor-
relation. They reported that the reaction mechanism controls the
particle  properties,  characteristics,  and  position  within  the  reac-
tor.  In  addition,  the  temperature  gradient  inside  the  particle  in-
fluences the biomass degradation rate and can determine the ex-
act amount of mass that is released. In their simulation of an en-
trained flow reactor, Tchapda and Pisupati [636] assumed spheri-
cal biomass particles and neglected any interaction or collision be-
tween the particles. They also considered very low volume fraction
of the particles in the reactor with a uniform temperature for every

particle. A partially stirred stochastic entrained flow gasification re-
actor model was presented by Weber et al. [637] , using a proba-
bility density function to describe state variables and mixing pro-
cesses,  and  a  Monte  Carlo  algorithm  with  operator  splitting  to
solve the problem.

6.4.2.3. Rotating cone reactors.  Wagenaar et al. [560] presented a
model  to  predict  the  product  distribution  of  rotating  cone  reac-
tors in a wide range of conditions. Their overall model consisted
of a single particle flow model, a single particle conversion model,
and a gas-phase reactor model. The gas-phase reactor model was
developed to  describe secondary  tar cracking  and to  predict the
composition of the gas mixture at the reactor outlet.

6.4.2.4. Downer  reactors.  Yu  et  al.  [138]  conducted  a  Euler-Euler
CFD modeling of biomass pyrolysis in a downer reactor that was
equipped with a solid-gas separator. They investigated the effects
of different operating conditions, separator geometry, and particle
properties on the overall hydrodynamics and separation efficiency
of  the  system  as  well  as  the  product  quality.  In  addition,  they
compared the simulated separator efficiency with the experimen-
tal data. In another study, Yu et al. [638] extended their previous
research [138] by including heat transfer equations and thermo-
chemical reactions taking place during the fast biomass pyrolysis.
Pyrolysis reactions were input as a one-step global reaction scheme
using a UDF in their CFD model. They reported satisfactory results
for the pyrolysis yield and the gas composition.

6.4.2.5. Ablative reactors.  Miller and Bellan [639] modeled pyroly-
sis in vortex reactors using a Euler-Euler approach and evaluated
the performance and optimal operating conditions. They also com-
pared one- and multi-dimensional particle models and discussed
the importance of biomass identity, particle size distribution, reac-
tor geometry, and scale. The vortex reactors were also modeled us-
ing a CFD Euler-Lagrange approach by Ashcraft et al. [640] , where
the authors suggested that these processes can be operated with-
out a solid carrier (sand), and that new biomass particles reach the
reactor temperature rapidly in vortex reactors.

Table  6.2  summarizes  the  different  reactor  models  developed
including biomass, reactor, and pyrolysis process details, as well as
the main features and objectives of the developed models.

6.5. Future research directions

Sections 6.1 –6.4 provided a critical review of the techniques ap-
plied  for  modeling  pyrolysis  reactors.  Upon  careful  investigation,
the research gaps described below were identified.

6.5.1. Model validation

While significant efforts are devoted to modeling various reac-
tors, the model predictions are seldom validated using experimen-
tal data. Nonetheless, as extensively discussed, pyrolysis involves
multi-faceted phenomena with conjugated interlinks. Isolating ev-
ery phenomenon and validating their superimposition poses sig-
nificant challenges which require integrating modeling and exper-
imental paradigms. Validation of various pyrolysis reactor models
provides a more rigorous design basis and robust inputs to the Life
Cycle Assessment LCA) and to advance the understanding of reac-
tor design implications on the system-wide environmental perfor-
mances.

Model validation is particularly more challenging for catalytic
pyrolysis and upgrading reactors. Fortunately, there is the wealth
of  knowledge  in  other  areas  such  as  catalytic  reactors  in  oil  re-
fineries, which can be adapted for bio-oil catalytic pyrolysis and
upgrading. Often the standard procedure for model development
and validation of catalytic processes involve the following steps:

• Step 1: Select optimal catalyst formulation by screening tests,
• Step 2: Conduct short-term experimentation (using Design of
Experiment)  to  understand  the  scale  of  transport  limitations,
the impact of operating conditions, feedstock composition, and
reactor type/scales on the main performance indicators such as
conversion, selectivity, and temperature profiles,

• Step 3: Construct and validate the first reactor model,
• Step 4: Reiterate from Steps 2 and 3 above until the model pre-

diction and experimental data are consistent,

• Step 5: Conduct long-term experimentation to understand the

stability and loss of catalyst with time,

• Step 6: Add deactivation terms to the reactor model using the

results of Step 5.

• Step 7: Reiterate from Steps 5 and 6 until the model prediction

and experimental data are consistent.

6.5.2. Managing computational complexities

As discussed, developing full-physical models for pyrolysis re-
actors requires significant effort and results in mathematical for-
mulations,  containing  nonlinear  algebraic  and  partial  differential
equations  which  are  formidable  for  the  available  solution  pack-
ages. Simplifying assumptions can reduce the problem order, but
this  requires  an  in-depth  understanding  of  involved  phenomena
and  their  interconnections.  Managing  computational  complexity
without sacrificing the model integrity and fidelity remains a re-
search  frontier,  particularly  in  the  case  of  catalytic  reactors.  The
way the experimentations are carried out can also help to reduce
the  computational  complexities.  For  example,  diffusion  terms  or
temperature-dependencies can be neglected in models developed
based on experiments conducted without significant mass transfer
limitations or isothermally, respectively.

6.5.3. Modeling emerging reactors

Most modeling studies are related to fluidized bed reactors with
few  studies  on  other  types  of  reactors.  Therefore,  more  work  is
needed  for  modeling  rotating  cone,  screw,  downer,  ablative  and
microwave-assisted pyrolysis reactors, as well as catalytic pyrolysis
and upgrading reactors. Such modeling advances will also be help-
ful for environmental performance evaluation at the system level.

6.5.4. Impact of reactor modeling on the multi-scale process design

The  development  of  reactor  modeling  in  the  context  of  the
multi-scale design of pyrolysis processes is a research frontier that
needs  to  be  studied  in  more  detail.  There  is  a  lack  of  knowl-
edge to correlate the reactor modeling to other aspects of process
development  such  as  cost  or  environmental  footprint.  Nonethe-
less, the proven knowledge from other applications such as gas-
to-liquids (GTL) processes could be transferred. For instance, Sade-
qzadeh et al. [6 45,6 46] have shown that in the Fischer-Tropsch re-
actor within a GTL process, a similar catalyst would have a slower
deactivation  in  a  slurry  reactor  than  in  a  fixed  bed  reactor,  and
thus the catalyst costs would be lower if a slurry reactor is selected
[6 45,6 46] .  Modeling  can  also  help  to  identify  the  recommended
modes of operation. As an example, Miller and Bellan [644] pre-
dicted that an intermediate temperature would achieve the max-
imum bio-oil yield at a given reactor set-up (see Fig. 6.3 ), using
their  model.  This  was  then  confirmed  in  an  experimental  study
[647] where the optimum bio-oil yield was achieved at 500 °C. This
demonstrates the prediction capabilities of a robust model to de-
sign the process without significant experimentation, thus reduc-
ing both the time and cost to develop the ideal flowsheet.

It is crucial to design pyrolysis processes/biorefineries such that
they  are  profitable.  Analysis  methods  such  as  techno-economic

analysis (TEA) play a central role on this front, as shown in several
biomass  pyrolysis  TEA  studies  reported  in  the  literature  [24,26–
28,30,32,649–663] . While there are simple economic profitability
analysis methods ( e.g. return on investment and payback period),
more detailed cash flow analysis has been commonly employed in
pyrolysis  TEA  studies  to  take  the  time  value  of  money  over  the
project lifetime ( i.e. economic lifetime of the plant which is typ-
ically 20–30 years [664] ) into account. Using cash flow analysis,
economic  performance  of  multiple  project  options  can  be  eval-
uated  (and  compared)  using  different  indicators  such  as  (1)  net
present value (NPV) at a fixed discount rate, (2) internal rate of re-
turn (IRR), which is the discount rate corresponding to a zero NPV,
or (3) the resulting minimum selling price (MSP) of the product(s)
[6,35,538] . The first two metrics are appropriate if the selling price
of the product is known or can be estimated. Otherwise, MSP can
be computed at a recommended IRR, which typically varies in the
range of 10–25%, depending on the source of investment ( e.g. pub-
lic or private). In general, projects with a positive NPV or IRR are
regarded as profitable and those with higher NPV or IRR (or lower
MSP) are economically more favorable than others.

7.1. State of the art

To begin, the economic potential of pyrolysis biorefineries de-
pends on the plant size [665] , measured in terms of the amount
of biomass processed or annual production capacity. Since energy
density of lignocellulosic biomass is low ( ∼18 MJ/kg) compared to
fossil-based fuels (42.8 MJ/kg of US diesel [6 6 6] ), costs associated
with the feedstock supply and logistics ( i.e. harvesting, collection,
and transportation) are significant, and thus, prospective cellulosic
biorefineries  are  expected  to  be  smaller  than  petroleum  refiner-
ies. For instance, most literature studies assume a biorefinery plant
capacity of 2,0 0 0 DMTPD [6 64,6 67] , which is 1–2 orders of mag-
nitude smaller than an average oil refinery in the US ( ∼129,0 0 0
barrels/day or ∼18,0 0 0 MTPD) or the world’s largest oil refinery
in  Jamnagar,  India  (1,240,0 0 0  barrels/day  or  ∼175,0 0 0  MTPD).  A
study by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) [26] esti-
mated that a 2,0 0 0 DMTPD pyrolysis biorefinery, with N th  plant
assumptions ( i.e. a mature technology), has the potential to pro-
duce biofuels (gasoline and diesel) at a minimum selling price of
$2.04/gal.

Broadly, the economic feasibility of biomass pyrolysis is highly
dependent on several factors that are discussed in other sections –
at a high level, these include the technology type ( e.g. slow vs. fast
pyrolysis, or catalytic vs. non-catalytic process), process configura-
tion ( e.g. single- vs. multi-step bio-oil upgrading process, source of
hydrogen), and type/number of the products ( e.g. liquid transporta-
tion fuels, hydrogen, chemicals, biochar, power, etc.). In addition,
process specific details such as the reactor type, catalyst technol-
ogy employed, and additional steps required ( e.g. preprocessing or
biomass drying) can influence the economic performance. From an
economic standpoint, fast pyrolysis is more favorable due to the
production of relatively higher value products ( i.e. bio-oil as op-
posed  to  biochar),  even  if  the  biochar  from  slow  pyrolysis  were
to be valorized at a price of $20–55 per metric ton ( e.g. revenues
due to carbon offsetting) [651] , and despite requiring about 50%
more  capital  investment.  Furthermore,  as  demonstrated  by  a  re-
cent study [668] given the relative yields and prices of bio-oil and
biochar, the economic viability of biochar heavily hinges on how
well the overall system performs in terms of bio-oil production.

Recently, Vispute et al. [654] proposed a multi-stage integrated
network for upgrading bio-oil to commodity products. They inves-
tigated the economics of several configurations including the up-
grading of the whole pyrolysis oil (WPO) or its water-soluble phase
(aqueous phase pyrolysis oil, APPO) in a FCC unit, potentially after
a single-stage or two-stage hydrotreating. While straight treatment

in zeolite-based FCC produced larger quantities of light products,
there was a higher chance of coke formation. Hence, it was recom-
mended to stabilize the bio-oil in hydrotreaters first prior to send-
ing it to the FCC. The overall yield increased with the number of
processing steps, with the highest yields in the scenario with two-
step hydrotreating followed by FCC. Compared to a simple FCC of
WPO only, the multi-step upgrading of APPO improved the overall
chemical yield by more than 100%; and resulted in additional rev-
enue even if the additional capital and operating expenditure were
included, making it attractive from an economic viewpoint. Later,
Brown et al. [29] found that the hydrotreating is essential to gen-
erate positive IRRs and pyrolysis yields of ≥70 wt% were needed to
reach IRR levels of 10% or more. Despite this, given that the indus-
trially relevant IRR is ∼25%, the authors concluded that the pyrol-
ysis technology, regardless of its configuration, requires further ad-
vancements if it were to attract significant investments. They also
observed that, despite being very different in terms of the number
of processing steps and the resulting IRRs, the capital requirement
was only different by ∼10% ($99–112 MM).

Sharifzadeh et al. [35] proposed to apply the integrated catalytic
upgrading scheme for retrofitting a conventional olefin process to
use biomass pyrolysis oil instead of naphtha. They extended the
analyses of the previous studies by detailed design of separation
processes, heat integration, and closing the overall mass and en-
ergy balances. They articulated their proposal in terms of the pro-
cess modifications that were needed to convert a petroleum-based
olefin process to a green one using biomass. Comprehensive stud-
ies including process retrofitting, flexibility analysis, in addition to
techno-economic and environmental analyses showed that the cost
of the bio-products remained economically competitive, while the
carbon footprint was reduced to half [35] .

Sirkar and Kumar [669] found that the large-scale biohydrogen
production from fast pyrolysis would cost $3.00–4.55/kg, thus re-
quiring carbon credits if biohydrogen were to be cost-competitive
with  H
2  produced  from  natural  gas.  In  contrast,  biohydrogen
produced  via  direct  biomass  gasification  [669]  was  found  to  be
cheaper, at $1.17–1.29/kg, because of the fewer number of steps. Al-
though biohydrogen production from fast pyrolysis could be more
expensive than from biomass gasification, Zhang et al. [28] showed
that the upgrading step in fast pyrolysis could have a significant
impact. Bio-oil reforming, for example, was found to give a higher
H
2  yield  (160  MTPD)  than  bio-oil  gasification  (147  MTPD),  in  a
facility  with  a  feed  processing  capacity  of  2,0 0 0  MTPD  and  was
substantially better in terms of energy efficiency (84% compared
to  74%  for  gasification).  Bio-oil  reforming  was  also  less  capital-
intensive ($333 MM vs. $435 MM for bio-oil gasification), making
it a more favorable upgrading pathway for biohydrogen production
(IRR = 18.6%) compared to bio-oil gasification (IRR = 8.4%).

Power  can  be  generated  in  fast  pyrolysis  followed  by  diesel
engines  for  $0.14/kWh  in  a  small  facility  (of  ∼1  MW  capacity),
or  $0.07/kWh  in  a  larger  facility  (of  ∼20  MW  capacity)  [670] .
However,  low  energy  conversion  rate  from  biomass  to  bio-oil
and  a  large  amount  of  electricity  required  for  biomass  grinding
[667] makes power generation from biomass inefficient, at larger
scales.

Bio-oil  upgrading  often  requires  hydrogen,  and  as  a  re-
sult,  choosing  catalysts  with  lower  hydrogen  consumption  (see
Section 3.3.4 ) would improve the process economy. Wright et al.
[25] also showed that using merchant H
2 is more economical than
onsite H
2 production from a portion of bio-oil, as the latter results
in lower yield ( ∼35 vs. 58 million gallons per year for onsite vs.
2 , respectively) and thus has a lower MSP by ∼$1.00/gal
merchant H
(corresponding to a MSP value of $3.09/gal vs. $2.11/gal for onsite
2 , respectively). In a more recent study, Zhang et al.
vs. merchant H
[28] however identified that it is more economical to produce H
2
onsite, via steam reforming of natural gas, compared to merchant

2 . Thilakaratne et al. [671] also found that it is more economi-
H
cal to have an onsite H
2 production facility for steam reforming of
non-condensable gases (NCG) and off-gases from the pyrolysis and
2 . The economics
hydroprocessing sections than using merchant H
was suggested to be further improved if the H
2 was produced by
steam reforming of natural gas than by NCG/off-gases.

Recently,  Sharifzadeh  et  al.  [31]  conducted  a  comprehensive
study  of  two  major  pyrolysis  oil  upgrading  technologies:  hy-
drodeoxygenation (HDO) and hydrothermal upgrading (HTU). De-
tailed experimental results coupled with modeling and analysis re-
vealed the fuel yield and hydrogen requirement of each technol-
ogy. In their analysis a fraction of the water-soluble phase of the
first-stage HTU product was used for hydrogen production and the
water-insoluble phase was sent to the second-stage hydrodeoxy-
genation. It was observed that hydrodeoxygenation technology fea-
tures a high fuel yield but suffers from a hydrogen deficit. Con-
versely, the hydrothermal upgrading process has a lower fuel yield
but  a  hydrogen  surplus.  A  synergistic  reaction  network  was  de-
veloped  in  which  a  fraction  of  bio-oil  was  upgraded  in  the  hy-
drodeoxygenation reactor and the rest in the HTU. The overall in-
tegrated process was found to be economically optimal and insen-
sitive to the hydrogen price. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis
demonstrated that while the process economics is robust with re-
spect to a variety of assumptions regarding biomass price, exper-
imental  data,  and  fuel  yield,  it  strongly  depends  on  the  process
scale.

In  a  novel  integrated  biorefinery  configuration  proposed  by
Sharifzadeh et al. [27] , a fast pyrolysis process was integrated with
microalgae cultivation for biofuel production. In this integrated ap-
proach, the CO
2 produced during fast pyrolysis and upgrading sec-
tions was captured and utilized for the growth of microalgae culti-
vation. It was found that, due to carbon capture and utilization, the
carbon-to-biofuel  conversion  efficiency  in  fast  pyrolysis  could  be
potentially improved from 55% to 73%, thereby synergistically re-
ducing CO
2 footprint of the overall process. In addition, due to the
integration of these two processes, the minimum selling price of
microalgae-derived-biofuel was found to be around 64–68% lower
than the minimum selling price of biodiesel produced in a stand-
alone microalgae biorefinery.

Given the uncertainty with the biomass supply and biofuel de-
mand growth, Sharifzadeh et al. [6] conducted stochastic optimiza-
tion of fast pyrolysis based supply chain networks. They found that,
while the deterministic scenarios were fueled by centralized pro-
duction facilities, mobile pyrolyzers can play an important role in
improving the resiliency of the supply chain networks. Mobile py-
rolyzers have the potential to reduce the lock-in capital, and there-
fore the associated risk which is very critical especially during the
early stages of the deployment. A recent study [672] evaluated the
economics of a mobile pyrolysis system for bio-oil production, us-
ing a novel fluidized bed reactor, and concluded that the overall
production cost of biofuels using mobile systems can be lower than
that of large-scale production facilities. Finally, process integration
offers significant opportunity for enhancing the efficiency of en-
ergy conversion. Dongke et al. [673] studied a combined heat and
power (CHP) process fed by syngas from pyrolysis and municipal
solid waste and demonstrated that such configuration has a higher
efficiency  and  cost  compared  to  conventional  steam  turbines,  at
lower scales ( < 5 MW).

7.2. Future research frontiers

While  some  studies  projected  an  optimistic  MSP  for  biofuels
derived  via  pyrolysis  (such  as  $1.74–2.04/gal  [26] ),  more  recent
studies estimated much higher values ( e.g. ∼$3.30/gal [22] ). While
some of these variations could be due to the differences in process
configuration, there appears to be significant uncertainty with the

numerous technical and economic assumptions given the current
state of the technology. In our opinion, this is mainly driven by
(1) the lack of high fidelity and quantitative characterization data
for biomass and products [126,674,675] , complete mass and energy
balances [676] , and fundamental understanding of underlying reac-
tion mechanisms [126] , (2) significant uncertainty around the asso-
ciated technical and economic parameters including capital expen-
diture [662,677] and catalyst performance in the upgrading process
[678] .

Despite  these  challenges,  pyrolysis  is  generally  regarded  as
an  economical  route  in  thermochemical  platforms  [676] .  Given
the current state of the technology, however, continued effort is
necessary  to  advance  pyrolysis  technology  to  a  point  where  it
is  also  economically  competitive  with  fossil-driven  technologies
[674,676,678] . Toward this objective, one of the key targets is to
achieve  high  yields  in  both  pyrolysis  and  upgrading  steps  [29] .
Higher yields are not only beneficial for improving economic pro-
files but also help the environmental footprint. Higher yields can
also reduce the feedstock utilization which is one of the most sig-
nificant cost contributors in MSP [29] . In addition, the use of other
chemical  inputs  ( e.g.  hydrogen  in  upgrading  steps)  needs  to  be
minimized, which in turn, will improve the economic and environ-
mental performance. Nonetheless, hydrogen utilization and conver-
sion efficiency are strong functions of the catalyst type and struc-
ture.

There  is  also  a  continued  need  for  detailed  techno-economic
analyses to help the research community in directing their future
work to key cost drivers that would likely result in the greatest
positive impact on the overall process economics [675] . In particu-
lar, value-added co-products may be considered in an integrated
biorefinery.  Hu  et  al.  [679] ,  identified  that  the  co-production  of
biochemicals ( e.g. aromatics and olefins) and biomaterials ( e.g. bio-
cement) is likely to remain profitable in 100% of scenarios studied,
whereas  the  biofuel  production  only  was  found  to  be  profitable
in 18% of the scenarios. The utilization of the existing infrastruc-
ture, whenever feasible technically and logistically, is yet another
strategy that could help improve the overall economics by reduc-
ing the production costs [26,123,6 80,6 81] , in addition to the en-
vironmental footprint. For instance, a recent study by Wright and
co-workers [682] has identified that the integration with a refinery
could potentially reduce the installed capital expenditure by more
than $100 MM. Although there is significant potential for integra-
tion with existing petroleum refineries, further research is needed
to ensure pyrolysis oil (in an upgraded form) can be processed in
these refineries with minimal infrastructural changes [681] . Infras-
tructure repurposing is another effective approach to lower overall
environmental  impacts  by  avoiding  extra  capital  inputs.  In  addi-
tion, as discussed earlier in Section 7.1 , mobile pyrolyzers [6] may
open  up  new  commercialization  avenues,  and  hence  further  re-
search on this area will be helpful as a stepping stone toward the
long-term and large-scale deployment of fast pyrolysis technolo-
gies. The economic success of such small-scale systems, however,
is dependent on several important considerations ( e.g. availability
of feedstock at a low price, and process performance in terms of
the fuel yield) [653] .

Furthermore,  given  the  potential  uncertainties  with  multiple
process  and  economic  parameters,  incorporating  detailed  uncer-
tainty  analysis  and  all  costs  as  an  integral  part  of  the  TEA  can
be very helpful as deterministic studies ( i.e. without any consid-
eration for uncertainty) and those with limited scope tend to un-
derestimate  biofuel  production  costs  [683] .  For  instance,  Vispute
et al. [654] used a performance metric ‘economic potential’, which
was defined as the difference between the revenue and the cost
of  primary  raw  materials  ( i.e.  biomass  and  hydrogen).  Based  on
the economic potential, three out of five scenarios exhibited com-
parable economics (with similar NPV values of $18 MM, $19 MM,

50

M. Sharifzadeh, M. Sadeqzadeh and M. Guo et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 71 (2019) 1–80

and $20 MM). Later, Brown et al. [29] investigated the same sce-
narios by including all the costs ( i.e. capital and energy, together
with raw materials costs) and found that the NPVs can be very dif-
ferent (-$26.2 MM, $9.0 MM, and -$2.8 MM, respectively). From this
analysis, it is evident that it is important to consider all the costs
to make informed decisions. In an initial study by Brown and co-
workers [24] , the utility section (to generate steam and electricity)
was not considered within the scope of the TEA which underesti-
mated the capital expenditure by $141 MM. By accounting for this,
and  improvising  on  the  cost  estimates  of  the  upgrading  section,
Brown and co-workers [671] have later found that the total capi-
tal expenditure was increased by more than 100% (from $200 MM
to  $429 MM)  and  MSP  was  increased  by  22%  (from  $2.11/gal  to
$2.57/gal of gasoline). Furthermore, some TEA studies made sim-
plifying  assumptions  for  the  wastewater  treatment  (WWT)  costs
without detailed modeling of the WWT section [684] . Given the
significance  of  WWT  costs  in  biorefineries  [685] ,  this  could  po-
tentially lead to wide variations in the results. In addition, in the
case of catalytic pyrolysis and upgrading, the costs related to plant
shutdown and catalyst change-outs need to be considered. Further-
more,  a  recent  study  [662] ,  by  comparing  the  capital  cost  esti-
mates in the literature, found that the difference between the pes-
simistic and optimistic assumptions in different studies in the lit-
erature is very significant, which could lead to a variation of NPV
by $300 MM. It is thus very important to ensure that the capital
requirement is reasonably accurate. For instance, by comparing the
estimates from different sources, whenever possible, one may im-
prove the resulting estimates.

Further research effort is also necessary to identify optimal pro-
cess configurations. For instance, while a previous study [29] ob-
served that the phase-separated bio-oil upgrading is economically
more favorable, a recent work [658] found that the WPO upgrad-
ing is more preferable in terms of economics. This may be due to
the differences in the technologies and end products considered.
For instance, the former study considered only chemicals ( i.e. no
fuel production) and the bio-oil were upgraded with FCC which, in
some scenarios, was preceded by one or two stages of hydrotreat-
ing.  In  the  latter  study,  both  the  chemicals  and  fuels  were  con-
sidered using hydroprocessing or reforming. Therefore, more com-
prehensive  studies  are  warranted  by  encompassing  all  the  path-
ways with possible technologies and suites of products (both fuels
and chemicals) to identify optimal pathways and/or to understand
the key cost bottlenecks in any given pathway. Furthermore, the
differences in process configurations could also be due to the as-
sumed  prices  of  chemicals  and  fuels.To  exacerbate  the  situation,
these prices are highly volatile. It is thus imperative to understand
the  impact  of  the  uncertainty  in  the  market  prices,  on  the  pro-
cess economics. In addition, feedstock type and supply-side uncer-
tainty  (in  terms  of  quantity  and  quality  e.g.  seasonal  variations)
would  impact  the  yield  and  product  distribution  of  pyrolysis  oil
[108] . This emphasizes the need for robust pyrolysis technologies
that can process a variety of feedstocks and/or feedstock blends. A
chemical or thermal pretreatment step prior to pyrolysis may en-
able pyrolysis technology to mitigate the risk of inherent variability
in the feedstock composition [108] . Yet another aspect that can po-
tentially improve biomass pyrolysis economics is biomass drying as
it can significantly reduce costs associated with biomass handling,
transportation, and pyrolysis itself. Various types of biomass dryers
are available including rotary, flash, and stationary- or fluidized-
bed dryers, that use different heating mediums such as hot air, hot
air mixed  with steam,  and/or superheated steam.  There is some
opportunity to optimize the biomass drying step by exploiting the
complex relationship of drying cost and throughput as a function
of key process parameters such as drying temperature and process-
ing time. For instance, an increase in drying temperature, which
typically reduces processing time and increases throughput, may

not necessarily reduce the costs [686] . Another related parameter
is the particle size as it can impact relative liquid and solid prod-
uct yields from pyrolysis [687] . In addition, given the energy in-
tensity of pyrolysis processes, energy integration with other facili-
ties ( e.g. CHP plants [6 88,6 89] ) could potentially improve the over-
all energy efficiency and thereby reduce the net production cost.
Energy integration could also lead to beneficial environmental sav-
ings by increasing energy efficiency, and thus reducing the exter-
nal energy demand. Furthermore, detailed exergy analysis can help
to improve the overall energy efficiency of the process [690] and
there are good examples of this for other processes in the litera-
ture [691–696] . Furthermore, biomass fractionation, into relatively
high concentration streams of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin,
may provide an opportunity to reduce the costs. Currently, such an
approach appears to be more common in the context of biologi-
cal biomass conversion ( i.e. fermentative route) as microbial host
performance tends to be substrate-specific. The success of such a
strategy heavily hinges on the economic viability of fractionation
technologies.  For  instance,  a  recent  study  [697]  investigated  the
economics of biomass fractionation into hemicellulose and cellu-
lose, and subsequent fermentation to co-produce 1,5-pentanediol
and  ethanol  has  identified  biomass  loading  during  fractionation
step as the key variable in determining the overall economic via-
bility. Furthermore, this study has reiterated the importance of co-
producing chemicals to improve the economic viability of biofuel
production.

As  discussed  earlier  in  Section  7.1 ,  the  source  of  hydrogen  is
also likely to play a critical role in determining the economic vi-
ability  of  biomass  pyrolysis  projects.  However,  an  economic  H
2
source  might  not  necessarily  lead  to  improved  environmental
scores, and thus, it is worth to explore the trade-offs between en-
2 sources. Given
vironmental and economic performances of the H
the current and projected price of natural gas [698] , which is likely
to remain below $5-$6 per MMBTU within the 2025–2030 time-
frame, H
2 produced either via onsite steam methane reforming or
purchased externally, are likely to remain economical compared to
other options [699] .

In addition to the important factors described above, catalyst
related parameters can influence the economics. Given the criti-
cal  role  of  catalysts  in  bio-oil  upgrading,  a  better  understanding
of  the  economic  impacts  of  catalyst  related  parameters  (such  as
the  lifetime  of  catalyst  and  the  regeneration  method)  is  crucial.
This will require long-term studies investigating the performance
of  the  catalyst  (as  a  function  of  time),  catalyst  stability  and  de-
activation mechanisms, and regeneration considerations (methods
employed, energy intensity, recovery efficiency, etc.) to be able to
objectively and accurately quantify their impact on the overall eco-
nomics  of  the  process.  These  details  are  generally  scarce  in  the
open literature. An exception to this is a recent study [700] which
investigated  two  different  catalyst  regeneration  configurations.  It
was found that the, despite being slightly less energy efficient (by
2%), a single-stage regeneration process is slightly more economi-
cal and, based on an sensitivity analysis, showed more robust eco-
nomic performance than a two-step process. More exhaustive stud-
ies of this nature are necessary to capture the impact of a wider ar-
ray of catalyst specific parameters. Similar to the discussion above,
a research gap on the environmental performances of the catalysts
has been identified, which is addressed further in Section 8 .

The choice of the reactor type is yet another important factor
in the economics of the process. A recent NREL study [22] inves-
tigated the economics of two types of upgrading reactor systems
( i.e. fluidized bed vs. fixed bed) for production of hydrocarbon fuel
blendstock by biomass fast pyrolysis followed by ex-situ catalytic
upgrading. With the assumption of similar yields in both alterna-
tives, despite being different technologies, the MSP (USD per gal-
lon  of  gasoline  equivalent,  $/GGE)  was  found  to  be  very  similar

-  $3.31/GGE  in  fluidized  bed  system  vs.  $3.33/GGE  in  fixed  bed
system.  This  study,  therefore,  reiterates  the  importance  of  yield
in  determining  overall  economics  – i.e.  although  using  very  dif-
ferent technologies with different cost structure, the overall eco-
nomics may still remain similar unless any of these specific dif-
ferences ( e.g . reactor type) leads to significant variation in the key
cost drivers such as yield and product portfolio. Therefore, there is
a need to carefully evaluate the economic potential of new tech-
nologies (such as microwave-assisted reactors systems) with a fo-
cus on investigating their impact on primary cost drivers such as
yield.

8. Environmental performance

In addition to diversification of energy resources, another main
driver for biomass pyrolysis is the increasing interest in environ-
mental sustainability. As demonstrated in Fig. 8.1 , a biomass pyrol-
ysis system concerns the entire life cycle of biomass growth, tech-
nology operation, and end-use phase. Life cycle assessment (LCA)
offers a systematic approach to capture all the processes and en-
vironmental aspects involved in these stages. The methodology of
LCA analyzes the cradle-to-grave environmental performance of a
product or service and has been widely recognized as an important
decision support tool for quantifying the environmental footprints.

8.1. The methodology of LCA

The  LCA  general  framework  has  been  formalized  by  the  In-
ternational Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards [701–
703] , which includes four phases: (1) goal and scope definition, (2)
life cycle inventory (LCI) analysis, (3) life cycle impact assessment
(LCIA), and (4) interpretation. In phase 1, the fundamental mod-
eling elements are described, which include the product, the sys-
tem boundaries, and the functional units. In addition, the princi-
ples and main methodologies to be applied are defined, including
data quality requirements, allocation approach, impact categories,
and impact assessment methods (characterization and normaliza-
tion methods). In the second phase, inventory data are collected
for each unit operation within the system boundaries and the in-
ventory  data  quality  is  analyzed  in  line  with  the  requirements,
scoped in the first phase [702] . LCI results are then analyzed in the
LCIA step, which is comprised of the mandatory element of charac-

terization and possibly optional considerations such as normaliza-
tion and weighting. Characterization refers to converting LCI out-
puts to category indicators by using defined characterization fac-
tors. The aggregated indicator results provide characterized profiles
of the studied system, which can be further normalized to give in-
formation on the relative magnitude of each indicator [703] . Sensi-
tivity and uncertainty analyses can be carried out to calibrate the
LCIA quality. Finally, LCI and LCIA outcomes are presented in the
interpretation  phase  in  accordance  with  the  goal  and  scope  de-
fined in the first phase to reach conclusions and recommendations
[703] . The four LCA phases are interactive with feedback loops e.g.
the system boundary can be redefined in line with the sensitivity
analysis of the LCIA phase.

8.2. State of the art

Table 8.1 summarizes the environmental research on biomass
pyrolysis  with  the  focus  on  emerging  fast  pyrolysis  technolo-
gies.  Diverse  groups  of  feedstocks  including  2G  lignocellulose
biomass, 3G algae, and waste have been considered. Particularly,
2G biomass such as corn stover [704,705] , dedicated 2G crops such
as  Poplar,  switchgrass,  Miscanthus  [27,706] ,  and  forest  residues
[685,707] have been studied.  Despite the  increasing research at-
tention on 3G algae biomass, very few LCA studies have been pub-
lished so far on the environmental profiles of microalgae or algae
oil  as  feedstocks  for  fast  pyrolysis  [708,709] .  The  environmental
benefits  of  using  waste  feedstocks  have  also  been  assessed  in  a
limited number of LCA studies [710,711] . Our literature review sug-
gests that the centralized pyrolysis system and particularly the cir-
culating fluidized bed pyrolysis with hydroprocessing has been the
LCA focus ( Table 8.1 ). The decentralized small-scale pyrolysis has
been rarely considered, despite potential benefits of such systems
for densifying agricultural biomass and meeting local energy mar-
ket demand. Interestingly, a few studies have covered the process
or supply chain integration options i.e. pyrolysis integration with
other thermochemical routes [705,707] and incorporation of pyrol-
ysis into biorefinery for the combined 1G and 2G biomass supply
chains [712] . No publicly available LCA has been found on the com-
parison of different fast pyrolysis technologies or production scales,
or the performance of alternative biomass. Energy vectors includ-
ing thermal and electrical energy as well as liquid biofuels are the
main concern in the available LCA studies, whereas the high-value

bioproducts ( e.g. biochemicals) production has been overlooked. As
shown in Fig. 8.1 , biogenic carbon fixation plays a significant role
in biomass pyrolysis life cycles. In a typical pyrolysis biofuel life
cycle, biogenic carbon ‘sequestration’ into the biofuels is achieved
via the 1G/2G/3G biomass cultivation phase, representing a ‘neg-
ative’ greenhouse gases (GHG) balance at this stage, which is fur-
ther released to theatmosphere as emissions ( e.g. CO
4 , and
CO) during the bio-refining and the combustion of the biofuel in
the vehicle engine. On the contrary, the biochemical and biomate-
rial sectors offer great potentials for high-value products such as
recyclable biopolymers, which can fix the biogenic carbon in the
long-term product cycles. Such biogenic carbon fixation effects can
be captured using a carbon counting approach [713] , which is dis-
cussed in the next section.

8.2.1. Methodology

The ISO 14040 series [701–703] of standards provide the gen-
eral  framework  for  undertaking  LCAs  and  indicate  generic  ap-
proaches. However, the applied LCA methodology is subjective and
should be specified according to the understudy product system.
Generally, the LCA methods can be broadly classified into attribu-
tional LCA (ALCA) and consequential LCA (CLCA). The former fo-
cuses on describing the environmentally relevant flows to and from
a life cycle system and its subsystems, and the latter aims to study
how environmentally relevant flows change in response to possible
decisions. Our literature review (given in Table 8.1 ) suggests that
all publicly available LCAs on fast pyrolysis are conducted from an
ALCA perspective, and there is a critical knowledge gap of the CLCA
evaluation.

The guiding principles in conducting LCA are (1) life cycle per-
spective, (2) transparency, and (3) completeness [703] . Usually, the
LCA studies tend to consider every stage of the product life cycle
[714] from the raw material acquisition to the final disposal. This
is often called ‘cradle-to-grave’ or ‘well-to-wheel (WtW)’ depend-
ing on the end-use fate. Other typical system boundary definitions
include ‘well-to-tank’ and ‘cradle-to-gate’ (or alternatively ‘well-to-
gate’). The former refers to a system that does not take the end-
use of biofuels into account, whereas the latter refers to the life
cycle excluding both distribution and end-use stages. The second
principle i.e. transparency, particularly in the assumptions and LCA
methodologies, ensures a reproducible analysis and appropriate in-
terpretation of the results can take place [703] . The third principle,
completeness,  leads  to  a  comprehensive  consideration  of  several
aspects of the natural environment, human health, and resources,
and helps to give holistic views. The literature studies reviewed,
have followed the life cycle perspective and transparency, although
their  choice  of  system  boundary  depended  on  the  research  pur-
pose. In terms of completeness, the majority of LCAs on fast py-
rolysis were focused on greenhouse gases and energy balance with
less attention to the wider range of environmental impact.

For multiple-product systems, three main allocation approaches
are  applicable  to  partition  the  material  and  energy  flows  and
their associated environmental impacts between the co-products.
These  are  (1)  allocation  by  physical  relation  ( e.g.  mass,  volume,
and energy content), (2) allocation by economic value, or (3) sys-
tem  boundary  expansion.  In  a  CLCA,  allocation  by  mass  or  eco-
nomic value can be avoided by applying system boundary expan-
sion  [715,716] .  Although  there  is  no  universal  agreement  on  the
allocation  method  in  ALCA,  the  system  boundary  expansion  has
been  indicated  as  the  preferred  approach  in  the  ISO  LCA  guide-
lines  [702,703]  as  well  as  in  the  Publicly  Available  Specification
(PAS) 2050 [717] . As highlighted by Dang et al. [705] , the alloca-
tion approach can be a sensitive decision for the LCA studies on
pyrolysis systems, as pyrolysis often produces several co-products
at different scales with different economic values. LCA of pyroly-
sis considering multiple allocation approaches would assign more

confidence in the research findings. Another important aspect in
the LCA allocation is the biogenic carbon. Carbon neutral assump-
tions have been generally adopted for pyrolysis [718] . Application
of either economic or energy-based approaches to the carbon al-
location  could  introduce  distortions  in  the  projected  carbon  se-
questration and release profiles between the main product and co-
products [719] . Thus, a carbon counting approach is recommended
to track the carbon flows from biomass to bioproducts and their
end-use phase over the life cycle. The carbon tracking analysis in-
cludes the carbon sequestration into the bioproducts from biomass
cultivation phase and the downstream release of the biogenic car-
bon  during  the  subsequent  processing,  its  end-use,  and  disposal
phases.  Such  an  approach  would  particularly  highlight  the  envi-
ronmental competitiveness of biochemicals or biopolymers which
have longer lifespans than bioenergy products.

8.2.2. Data quality

The focus of data quality analysis is the uncertainty in the ac-
quired datasets, and the sensitivity of results to measurement error
and noise. Data quality analysis has been traditionally considered
as  an  optional  element  of  LCA  for  which  specific  methodologies
and  guidelines  are  provided  by  the  United  States  Environmental
Protection Agency (USEPA) [720] and the ISO [703] . However, given
the diversity of biomass resources and emerging new technologies,
the significance of data analysis becomes more and more evident.
Amongst the sensitivity analysis methods, scenario analysis is
a widely applied approach [713,721] . As summarized in Table 8.1 ,
this  approach  has  been  adopted  in  several  studies  to  test  the
assumptions  regarding  process  parameters  [33,722,723] ,  system
boundary,  and  the  selected  scenarios  [723,724] .  The  effects  of
methodological options such as allocation approaches [705] , vari-
ation in the LCIA characterization model, and temporal boundary
definition ( e.g. 100 years vs. infinite) have been rarely examined in
previous LCA studies.

In  contrast,  uncertainty  analysis  is  not  commonly  performed
for  biomass  pyrolysis  technologies.  Uncertainty  classification,  the
source of uncertainty, and the methodology applied to express un-
certainty have all important implications [719] . Amongst a range of
uncertainty analysis approaches, Monte Carlo simulation is widely
applied  [721] ,  and  specific  methodologies  have  been  developed
[725–727] . Hsu [728] and Dang et al. [705] applied Monte Carlo
methods to quantify the uncertainties introduced in the LCA re-
sults for pyrolysis due to the variability of inventory data, where
the key parameters reflecting technology representativeness were
examined. Temporal and geographical dimensions [703] were not
covered. The uncertainty analyses combined with sensitivity anal-
yses presented in pyrolysis-focused studies [705,728] not only led
to an increase in the confidence in the LCA findings but also sug-
gested that previous studies lacking explicit interpretation of the
degree  of  uncertainty  and  sensitivities  should  not  be  used  as  a
robust evidence for comparative assertions [713] . Thus, more re-
search effort needs to be focused on LCA inventory development
with an emphasize on data reliability and variability.

8.2.3. Greenhouse gas emissions analysis

Table 8.1 suggests that GHG emissions are the most frequently
used measure for the environmental performance of pyrolysis sys-
tems.  A  summary  of  results  in  terms  of  GHG  emissions  for  the
gasoline produced from biomass pyrolysis is shown in Fig. 8.2 . Re-
sults for diesel are generally close to those for gasoline and there-
fore are not presented in all studies. A significant variability in the
GHG  profiles  of  pyrolysis  systems  was  observed,  ranging  from  -
0.053 to 0.061 kg CO
2 eq./MJ gasoline due to the variations in feed-
stocks, scenarios, moisture content, process design ( e.g. heat inte-
gration), the source  of  energy, LCA  system  boundaries, and allo-
cation method. Overall, the pyrolysis gasoline offers a promising

2 eq./MJ at refinery gate) [740] .

2 eq./MJ (0.0146 kg CO

Hsu et al. [741] from NREL conducted a ‘well-to-wheel’ analy-
sis for gasoline production from pyrolysis of forest residues. Their
mass and energy analysis was based on a technical report by Jones
et al.’ study [26] . They reported a relatively high GHG emission of
0.049 kg CO
2 eq./MJ (Hsu et al. (Scenario a) [741] in Fig. 8.2 ) for the
baseline design. However, in the scenario that the imported elec-
tricity from the grid was replaced with biomass-derived electricity,
the GHG emission was reduced to 0.035 kg CO
2 eq./MJ (Hsu et al.
(Scenario b) [741] in Fig. 8.2 ). In a follow-up study, NREL and PNNL
worked together to refine the LCA results to be 0.039 kg CO
2 eq./MJ
for the grid electricity case (Hsu et al. (Scenario a) [728] in Fig. 8.2 )
and 0.025 kg CO
2 eq./MJ for biomass-derived electricity case (Hsu
et al. (Scenario b) [728] in Fig. 8.2 ). Hsu et al. [728] pointed out
that the electricity imported from grid accounts for 37% of the net
GHG emissions, and fossil-based hydrogen accounts for 51% of the
net GHG emissions. Therefore, they performed an alternative case
study where the grid electricity was replaced by biomass-derived
electricity  and  this  resulted  in  a  36%  reduction  in  the  net  GHG
emissions. These findings were echoed by a more detailed contri-
bution analysis of Peters et al. [734] who showed that 70.8% of the
overall electricity consumption is from the pyrolysis plant and is
closely linked to feedstock drying.

Meanwhile, the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) conducted
an LCA of forest residue pyrolysis (Han et al. [729] ), using tech-
nical specifications adapted from Jone et al.’ study [26] , enabling
a  sound  analysis.  They  reported  a  relatively  lower  GHG  score
(0.036 kg CO
2 eq./MJ) for forest residue derived gasoline than Hsu
et al. [741] , even though they also considered the energy needed
for  biomass  drying  and  grinding.  The  difference  was  explained
by  the  improved production  efficiency  in  their  study  as  a  lower
feedstock moisture was assumed (Han et al. (Scenario a) [729] in
Fig. 8.2 ). They also analyzed another pyrolysis pathway using corn
2 eq./MJ
stover as a feedstock and reported a factor of 0.030 kg CO

(Han et al. (Scenario b) [729] in Fig. 8.2 ). Under the scenario of
replacing the  natural  gas  required for  hydrogen  production  with
off-gases, the GHG emissions were reduced further to 0.013 kg CO
2
eq./MJ (Han et al. (Scenario b) [729] in Fig. 8.2 ), illustrating the sig-
nificance of process integration in sustainability improvement. In a
follow-up study, Han et al. [730] updated their model to investi-
gate various biochar applications in addition to different hydrogen
sources. The reported GHG emission factors were (1) 0.011 kg CO
2
eq./MJ  for  the  scenario  in  which  the  pyrolysis  oil  was  reformed
for hydrogen production and biochar was combusted for electric-
ity generation [730] , and (2) -0.011 kg CO
2 eq./MJ for the scenario
in which the pyrolysis oil was reformed for hydrogen production
and biochar was applied as a soil improver for which carbon se-
questration credit was accounted [730] .

PNNL later updated their prospective 2017 design by incorpo-
rating new assumptions on feedstock moisture and derived GHG
scores of 0.032 (Snowden-Swan et al. (Scenario a) [732] in Fig. 8.2 )
and 0.037 kg CO
2 eq./MJ (Snowden-Swan et al. (Scenario b) [732] in
Fig. 8.2 ) for forest residue and Poplar derived gasoline, respectively.

8.2.3.1. Implications  of  LCA  methodologies  on  GHG  profiles.  The
methodological choices play a significant role in the LCA results,
which include system boundary definition as well as the allocation
method.  Iribarren  et  al.  [742]  conducted  a  ‘well-to-gate’  analysis
for Poplar pyrolysis pathways based on the data from Jones et al.
[26] with economic allocation method applied to split the environ-
mental burdens between the main products (diesel and gasoline)
and the co-product (biochar). The low GHG balance of -0.053 kg
CO
2 eq./MJ, they reported, is therefore attributed to the exclusion
of  the  distribution  and  the  end-use  of  fuels.  The  same  research
group  later  published  a  LCA  study  [734] ,  based  on  an  in-house
Aspen Plus ® model for a Poplar-to-fuels pathway and applied an
energy-based allocation approach that reported GHG profiles of -
2  eq./MJ for the ‘well-to-gate’ case (Peters et al. (Sce-
0.036 kg CO
2 eq./MJ for the ‘well-to-
nario a) [734] in Fig. 8.2 ) and 0.039 kg CO
wheels’ case (Peters et al. (Scenario b) [734] in Fig. 8.2 ).

Similarly,  Zhang  et  al.  [733]  studied  a  range  of  environmen-
tal impact categories for corn stover pyrolysis based on an Aspen
Plus ® model in which hydrotreating was carried out with hydro-
gen produced from steam reforming of bio-oil that also provided
some extra hydrogen as a co-product. This gave a relatively small
GHG emissions factor of 0.014 kg CO
2 eq./MJ as a result of system
boundary expansion.

Dang et al. [735] studied the environmental footprint of corn
stover pyrolysis. They considered three different configurations for
hydrogen production: (1) natural gas-derived hydrogen, (2) steam
reforming  of  bio-oil  with  no  extra  hydrogen  generated,  and  (3)
steam  reforming  of  bio-oil  with  extra  hydrogen  as  a  co-product
while pyrolytic lignin was hydroprocessed for liquid biofuel pro-
duction. The GHG emission factors for these three cases were 0.029
(Dang et al. (Scenario a) [735] in Fig. 8.2 ), 0.025 (Dang et al. (Sce-
nario  b)  [735]  in  Fig.  8.2 )  and  -0.018  (Dang  et  al.  (Scenario  c)
[735] in Fig. 8.2 ) kg CO
2 eq./MJ, respectively. Although the authors
mentioned a ‘well-to-tank’ approach for their study, they did not
take the carbon sequestered in corn stover into account which im-
plies the carbon neutral ( i.e. carbon sequestration offsetting GHGs
from end-use) assumption. Therefore, the GHG emission factors re-
ported in this study represent a ‘well-to-wheels’ life cycle.

8.2.3.2. Implications of pyrolysis feedstock  type.  In addition to the
2G biomass types mentioned above, the environmental aspect of
energy  grass  pyrolysis  was  also  investigated  ( e.g.  Zaimes  et  al.
[706] ). The GHG emissions factors for switchgrass or miscanthus
derived fuel ranged from 0.022 to 0.0 61 kg CO
2 eq./MJ [70 6] . A re-
cent study by Yang et al. [737] reported a GHG emission factor of
0.015 kg CO
2 eq./MJ for syngas produced from agricultural residue
in China. Moreover, this study performed a sensitivity analysis on
the important parameters ( i.e. utilization of exhaust, transport dis-
tance, and electricity-generation structure) affected by the national
policy.

In summary, the GHG scores for 2G biomass (including forestry
or agricultural residue, energy crops) fell into the range of -0.053
2  eq./MJ,  varying  with  their  assumptions,  system
to  0.061 kg  CO
boundaries, and allocation approaches. Some previous studies sug-
gested  that  the  pyrolysis  reactor  is  not  the  dominant  GHG  con-
tributor  in  2G  biomass  pyrolysis  systems  where  other  processes
such  as  the  biomass  feedstock  pretreatment  (drying  and  sizing)
and steam reforming of natural gas for hydrogen production are
more likely be the main two GHG contributors (see, for example,
Iribarren et al. [742] ).

In comparison to terrestrial biomass (2G), aquatic biomass (3G)
shows a range of desirable traits including no competition for land,
high resource-utilization efficiency, high CO
2 sequestration capac-
ity, tolerance to a wide range of conditions and seasonal variations,
rapid  production  cycle  and  high  photosynthesis  efficiency  [743] ,
and high bio-oil yield with superior quality [41,44] . Previous re-
search by Lopez-Gonzalez et al. [709] also suggested desirable GHG
profiles of biofuel derived from microalgae. It was found that ther-
mochemical conversion process is not a large source of GHG emis-
2  eq./MJ  fuel)  compared  to  algae  cultiva-
sions  (0.015–0.020 g  CO
2 eq./MJ) or dewatering (0.060–0.150 g CO
tion (0.025–0.087 g CO
2
2 capture and utilization
eq./MJ) processes [708] . The effects of CO
in microalgae pyrolysis system has also been investigated.

As mentioned earlier, biomass chemistry imposes an important
constraint on biofuel production, i.e. oxygen removal results in a
large amount of inventible CO
2 by-product. For example, in the py-
rolysis pathway, from every carbon atom in the original biomass
feed, almost one atom ends up in CO
2  emissions. Therefore, CO
2
utilization  is  an  indispensable  element  of  future  integrated  bio-
refineries. Recently, Sharifzadeh et al. [27] investigated the possi-
bility of enhancing the biofuel yield of a biomass pyrolysis process,
2 capture and utilization via microalgae cultivation and
through CO

demonstrated that it is possible to reduce the GHG emissions from
the standalone pyrolysis process by an order of magnitude in the
integrated scheme. They reported GHG emission factors of 0.007
and 0.015 kg CO
2 eq./MJ, for photobioreactors (PBR) and open pond
(OP) scenarios, respectively (Sharifzadeh et al. (Scenario a) [27] and
Sharifzadeh et al. (Scenario b) [27] in Fig. 8.2 , respectively).

8.2.4. Biochemicals and bioelectricity

In  addition  to  the  pyrolysis  of  municipal  solid  or  biodegrad-
able wastes to various products ( e.g. electricity, biofuel, or biochar)
[710,711,739] , biomass conversion to bioelectricity [704] and bio-
chemicals [35,736] via pyrolysis has been also under scrutiny. Shar-
ifzadeh  et  al.  [35]  investigated  the  environmental  footprint  of  a
biochemical  production  through  the  integrated  catalytic  upgrad-
ing  of  the  bio-oil.  They  proposed  a  retrofit  scheme,  in  which  a
conventional  olefin  process  producing  olefins  and  aromatics  was
retrofitted  to  consume  biomass  instead  of  naphtha.  The  signifi-
cance of this decarbonization scheme is that olefins production, as
a major building block of the chemical industry, is a relatively ma-
ture technology. In other words, the number of existing processes
is significantly larger than the number of new processes which are
being built. Therefore, retrofitting existing processes is more likely
to attract investment and to protect the environment. Sharifzadeh
et  al.  [35]  reported  GHG  emissions  in  the  range  of  2.04–3.04 kg
CO
2  eq./kg for the olefinic and aromatic biochemicals. A compar-
ison  with  other  pathways  for  producing  olefin  products  such  as
hydrocracking of naphtha and ethane [744] , gasification of munic-
ipal solid wastes [745] , and ethanol produced through enzymatic
hydrolysis of corn [746] , cassava [746] , and wood [747] , suggested
that the selected pyrolysis pathway is more environmentally ben-
eficial and leads to lower GHG emissions, because it significantly
reduces the number of processing steps required.

8.2.5. Catalysts and conversion technologies

In  the  previously  published  LCA  studies,  the  research  effort
has  been  mainly  focused  on  fluidized  bed  reactors  and  the  im-
pacts  of  catalysts  were  often  overlooked  or  estimated  using  a
surrogate  dataset  [730,733]  ( e.g.  Ni  and  zeolite  instead  of  man-
ufactured catalysts). Very limited research has compared the en-
vironmental  profiles  of  catalysts  for  hydrotreating  fast  pyrolysis
oils  [748] .  Snowden-Swan  et  al.  [748]  modeled  the  production
3  and  Ru/C),  and  con-
of  bio-oils  using  two  catalysts  (NiMo/Al
cluded that NiMo/Al
3  delivered better GHG scores (5.5 kg CO
2
eq./kg) throughout the cradle-to-refinery-gate life cycle stages and
the Ru/C GHG profiles varied significantly with the LCA allocation
methods  (13.7  and  80.4 kg  CO
2  eq./kg  following  mass  and  eco-
nomic allocation, respectively).

8.2.6. The whole system perspective

Often there is a strong trade-off between the economic perfor-
mance and environmental footprint of biorefineries. Therefore, in-
tegration of LCA and techno-economic metrics into multi-objective
optimization provides a unified decision support framework. The
aim is to ensure that the designed biorefinery is both economically
viable and environmentally sustainable. You et al. [749–752] pro-
posed a bi-criteria nonlinear programming (NLP) model that seeks
to maximize the economic performance measured by the NPV and
to minimize the environmental impacts ( i.e. global warming poten-
tial).

From the whole LCA system perspective with expanded system
boundaries, other potential value-added co-products from biomass
pyrolysis  such  as  biochar  could  bring  additional  environmental
benefits. Biochar can offer adsorption functions to capture and fix
CO
2 via various applications, where the climate change mitigation
effects vary with the life cycles and applications of the biochar. As
highlighted in recent reviews [156,157,753] , pyrolysis biochar bene-
fiting from its stability and other physical properties can act as car-

bon sequester in particular in long-term applications e.g. to replace
up to 50% of plaster mixture or to develop lightweight concrete
panels  and  biochar-lime  bricks.  Despite  few  studies  [734]  which
considered  the  environmental  benefits  of  biochar  derived  from
slow pyrolysis in alternative applications e.g. soil amendment, pre-
vious LCA research on pyrolysis modeled biochar as a fuel bring-
ing  energy  credits  [711,734,754] .  A  significant  research  gap  has
emerged on the biochar acting as an environmentally beneficial co-
product in pyrolysis; which means that the GHG saving effects and
environmental  implications  of  pyrolysis  configurations  and  feed-
stock on the CO
2 adsorption functions of biochar need further in-
vestigation.

8.3. Future research frontiers

Based on our critical literature review, several potential research

areas are identified:

1. As  discussed  earlier,  biomass  composition  imposes  an  impor-
tant constraint on biorefineries in terms of the large CO
2  by-
product. Therefore, carbon capture and sequestration/utilization
will be indispensable elements of future biorefineries, deliver-
ing  both  economic  and  environmental  impacts.  Furthermore,
as  many  fuel  and  chemical  industries  are  relatively  mature,
retrofitting existing processes in which fossil-derived feedstocks
are  replaced  with  renewable  feedstock  such  as  biomass  and
bio-oil is an important, yet neglected decarbonization pathway.
2. The “self-sustained” biorefineries with respect to the required
utilities show significantly better environmental footprint. This
is because biomass pretreatment ( i.e. drying and grinding) can
be energy intensive. Hence, biochar and off-gases can be burnt
to generate the required steam and electricity. The alternative
application of biochar for soil enrichment provides promising
carbon sequestration options but is subject to significant uncer-
tainties regarding the biochar carbon content and carbon reten-
tion factors.

3. Hydrogen  production  via  natural  gas  steam  reforming  (either
produced onsite or purchased off the fence) leads to additional
CO
2  emissions.  The  alternative  is  bio-oil  reforming,  although
this lowers the biofuel yield. Hence, a trade-off between the hy-
drogen cost and the biofuel yield could help with the optimal
design and operation of biorefineries which is crucial for their
sustainability, and requires further investigation.

4. The majority of LCA studies have been focused on GHG eval-
uation and fossil resource depletion, and other environmental
impact categories ( e.g. eutrophication, acidification, ozone layer
depletion, and ecotoxicity) are often overlooked (see Table 8.1 ).
For sustainable design of a pyrolysis-based biorefinery, a con-
sistent whole system evaluation approach is required, assessing
the holistic environmental performance of alternative processes
and products, in long-term.

5. All the biofuels derived from centralized pyrolysis systems re-
viewed in our study, proved to be environmentally superior to
conventional fossil-driven refineries in  terms  of  the  life cycle
GHG balances ( e.g. 0.093 kg CO
2 eq./MJ for gasoline). However,
there is no LCA research carried out on the comparison of var-
ious  feedstocks.  Further  LCA  research  on  feedstock  screening
and technology comparison as well as process integration will
help to advance the sustainable performance of pyrolysis sys-
tems, contributing more effectively to the energy system decar-
bonization.

6. A  significant  methodological  challenge  lies  in  the  analysis
of  data  quality.  Considering  biomass  pyrolysis  as  an  under-
development technology, there are significant uncertainties in
reaction  yield,  feedstock  requirements,  and  product  qualities.
Therefore, future LCA research should include explicit interpre-

tation of the degree of sensitivity (on key parameters, system
boundaries, and LCA methodologies) and the uncertainty cali-
bration at both the LCI and LCIA levels, which could assign the
confidence in the conclusions drawn from the LCA models.
7. To understand the potential trade-offs between conflicting envi-
ronmental targets and economic objectives, whole-system mod-
eling approaches, integrating multiple LCA criteria (rather than
GHG-focused targets only) into multi-objective optimization is
recommended.

8. The environmental impacts of the catalysis in the pyrolysis pro-
cesses need to be studied further. There is currently very lim-
ited information in the literature about the catalysts with the
lowest environmental footprint, given that this is a complicated
subject and involves considering catalyst manufacturing, load-
ing and start-up, catalyst lifetime, discharge, and recycling of
the active species.

9. Biochar can be used to remove tar from pyrolysis-driven syngas.
Such  technological  advances  may  lead  to  significant  environ-
mental protection reducing GHG scores and resource depletion.
LCA can be used to highlight the environmental benefits and
identify the best pathway by comparing the alternative path-
ways for biomass pyrolysis [755,756] .

10. Fast pyrolysis with CO

2 as a cost-effective reaction medium is
2 -assisted pyrolysis
2 activation of biochar, as
2  capture and utilization is a potent research area

another research frontier. Thereby, LCA of CO
for enhanced syngas generation or CO
well as CO
[757] .

9. Supply chain

The energy consumed over the last 27 years was equal to the
energy consumed in all the previous years [758] . Currently, most of
the primary energy consumption is sourced from fossil fuels (81%
from petroleum, coal, and natural gas in 2013) resulting in large
greenhouse gas emissions. As an alternative to conventional fuels,
biofuels are renewable energy sources which can be produced in
three physical states: solid, liquid, or gas from biomass [759] . The
biofuel  market  has  grown  dramatically  during  the  last  15  years
and the first-generation (basically ethanol and biodiesel) biofuels
are  currently  available  in  the  market  to  substitute  conventional
fuels. In 2014, the total production of ethanol and biodiesel was
three times greater than in 2004 [760] . Despite various incentives
that  triggered  such  growth,  many  issues  have arisen  around  the
first-generation biofuels. The main drawback is that the feedstocks
used in these technologies are principally corn and sugarcane with
potential overlaps with the human food supply chain. Therefore,
there  is  a  growing  interest  for  the  second-generation  (lignocel-
lulosic)  and  third-generation  (algal-based)  biomass-derived  fuels
[761] . As discussed in Section 2.2 , an enabling technology for ex-
ploiting  second-  and  third-generation  biomass  feedstocks  is  the
fast pyrolysis technology [762] . Despite its potential, this technol-
ogy has not been yet commercialized at an industrial scale mainly
because of the high risk of investing in a new technology [763] .
Supply chain optimization has been identified as a way to mini-
mize this risk by designing a highly flexible network that intercon-
nects all the entities related to the production process in order to
improve the overall network efficiency and accommodate potential
uncertainties [764] . In this context,  different biomass feedstocks,
which are geographically dispersed, can be efficiently (pre-)treated,
transported, and/or stored, to make biofuels compatible with cur-
rent infrastructures and engines in an economic way.

recent years, and classifies the most up-to-date research into seven
categories: (1) strategy, (2) topology, (3) solution algorithm, (4) en-
vironmental criteria, (5) stochastic modeling, (6) products, and (7)
technology. As can be seen from this table, the exisitng studies in
the literature have very diverse scopes. They start from the produc-
tion of a broad range of biofuels, and the processing technologies
that each feedstock favors, to the operational strategies required
for supply chain management. Other important aspects include hy-
brid technologies and potential integration with other supply chain
networks, as well as quantification of the environmental impacts
of the overall supply chain network and their trade-off with the
economic profitability. The transportation distance of feedstock, in-
termediate products, and final biofuels have profound implications
on the profitability and environmental impacts of the overall bio-
fuel supply chain. Regional studies in various parts of the world in-
vestigating the optimal location of biorefineries give testimony on
the significance of supply chain geographical configuration [6,765–
770] . The key observation is that there is often a need to estab-
lish a compromise between the location of facilities, transportation
costs, and the required biomass pretreatment [771,772] .

9.1.1. Supply chain configuration

Any supply chain can be analyzed from the perspective of its
constituents, namely (1) the upstream element which is responsi-
ble for feedstock procurement and pretreatment, (2) the midstream
element which encompasses the conversion and refinement tech-
nologies, and (3) the downstream element which supplies the pro-
duced chemical and fuels to the consumers. Fig. 9.1 shows a py-
rolysis supply chain in the UK. Additionally, a key aspect of the
biofuel supply chain from a pyrolysis pathway is its potential in-
teraction with other supply chain networks, e.g. other biofuels that
share common raw materials, or conventional fuels that share the
same final consumer.

mission from Sharifzadeh et al. [6] ).

9.1.1.1. The upstream.  The upstream part of a biofuel supply chain
consists  of  all  the  activities  prior  to  the  transformation  of  the
biomass to biofuel, including biomass plantation, cultivation, har-
vesting, collection, pretreatment, and storage [788] , all with pro-
nounced uncertainties. The economic viability of biofuel produc-

tion  strongly  depends  on  the  biomass  price  [789] .  As  a  result,
biomass  resources  which  are  remote  and  incur  expensive  trans-
portation costs are less likely to be economically competitive [6] .
Biomass availability is associated with a large degree of uncertainty

61

and  can  vary  significantly  on  seasonal  and  yearly  bases.  Certain
raw materials are not available all year round due to seasonality or
can be found heterogeneously distributed along a region [790] . Of-
ten, geographical information systems are used in order to estimate
the biomass availability [791] as a constant supply of raw materi-
als is critical for the economic viability of the process. Fortunately,
more than one feedstock can usually be used to manufacture the
same product [752,761] . The flexibility of biomass pyrolysis in the
application of various types of feedstocks is thus an important ad-
vantage  of  this  technology  compared  to  other  biofuel  pathways.
Such an advantage, however, comes at the price of more complex-
ities in the upstream of the supply chain. The biofuel quality de-
pends dramatically on the biomass properties, and the energy re-
quirement is a function of moisture content. For instance, open-
air biomass storage, even though less capital intensive, might not
be the cheapest option due to the exposure of biomass to ambi-
ent humidity [792,793] . Often, due to high degrees of uncertainty,
there is a need to oversize the design of production facilities and
warehouses [771] .

9.1.1.2. The  midstream.  The  midstream  section  of  biofuel  supply
chain consists of the conversion processes. The design decisions in-
clude the number, the location, the type, and the size of processing
sites. The operational decisions include the allocation of raw ma-
terials amongst processing facilities, routing intermediate products
and managing the stock levels. The differentiation between design
and operational decisions is due to the fact that design decisions
have physical realization. When the production facilities are con-
structed, their number, size, and locations become fixed and can-
not be changed without costly process retrofit. However, the opera-
tional decisions are available to counteract the negative realization
of uncertainties or to take advantage of their positive occurrence.

Biomass  pyrolysis  can  be  conducted  through  centralized,  de-
centralized,  or  mobile  production  strategies  [6,777,794] .  Central-
ized production strategy refers to the scenario where the biomass
is transported to large processing facilities. It often requires fewer
but larger processing sites benefitting from the economies of scale.
However, it also implies higher transportation costs. In a decen-
tralized  production  strategy,  the  processing  facilities  are  smaller
and located closer to biomass resources. Therefore, more produc-
tion sites are needed [777] . Clearly, there is a need to establish a
trade-off between the economies of scale and transportation costs.
In addition, the mobile production strategy has recently attracted
investors’ attention [7,653,795] . A mobile production strategy refers
to  the  relatively  small-scale  skid-mounted  facilities  are  shipped
to remote but inexpensive biomass resources. Not only this does
strategy reduce the transportation costs but it also enhances the
flexibility of the overall supply chain network [6] .

9.1.1.3. The  downstream.  The  downstream  part  endeavors  to  dis-
tribute the biofuel to the final consumers either directly or through
distribution centers. Researchers have devoted their effort to study
the upstream and midstream parts of the supply chain, and mi-
nor attention is paid to the downstream section. The main oper-
ational  and  tactical  challenges  arise  when  multiple  products  are
produced in a single facility, normally in the liquid state or even af-
ter conversion to electricity. From a strategic point of view, the cre-
ation of infrastructures dedicated to transporting renewable liquid
or gaseous fuels is an important consideration, since most of the
biofuels are not transportable by existing pipelines due to corro-
sion and contamination problems [796] . Therefore, the most stud-
ied transportation methods are containers in trucks, trains, or ships
at the national supply chain level [797,798] , and ships or tankers
for international supply chains [771] .

9.1.1.4. Integration with other networks.  Pyrolysis depending on the
feedstock, operating conditions, and potential application of cataly-
sis, generates different products and by-products. Indeed, the pro-
duction of commodity chemicals via biomass fast pyrolysis and cat-
alytic upgrading can be economically feasible on its own [35,657] .
Studies of pyrolysis supply chains for producing hydrogen, liquid
fuels, and lignin production demonstrated that the annual profit is
more sensitive to the price of hydrogen and liquid fuels than com-
modity chemicals [658] . Nevertheless, the fuel sector is several or-
ders of magnitude larger than the chemical sector adding to the
complexity of co-generation supply chains.

Not only a pyrolysis pathway can produce a diverse array of fu-
els and chemicals, it has also significant potential for integration
with other biotechnologies within the context of “integrated biore-
fineries”. Sharifzadeh et al. [27] showed that it is possible to uti-
lize the CO
2 generated during biomass pyrolysis and upgrading for
additional  biofuel  production  through  microalgae  cultivation  and
lipid extraction. The proposed framework exploited synergies be-
tween the two technologies for enhanced carbon conversion and
savings  through  the  economies  of  scale.  However,  the  economic
and environmental improvements come at the price of more com-
plex supply chains, especially in terms of land use and water con-
sumption, and this needs further investigation.

9.1.2. Supply chain management

The  economic  and  environmental  performance  of  a  pyrolysis
supply  chain  also  depends  on  the  management  and  operational
strategies.  Supply  chain  management  endeavors  to  improve  the
competitiveness of the network as a whole by integrating its or-
ganizational constituents in order to satisfy the customer demands
[799] . Depending on the operational timescale, supply chain man-
agement may have three scopes: (1) strategic, (2) tactical, and (3)
operational,  which  conform  to  the  automation  paradigm  shown
in Fig. 9.2 . Strategic decisions are taken at the highest level and
involve  optimal  decision-making  regarding  continuous  improve-
ment of the network design, feedstock procurement and storage,
retrofitting of the existing processing sites, investment in new fa-
cilities, (re-)allocation of production capacities, or distribution of
product among others [800] . In contrast, the tactical levels involve
mid-term and short-term production scheduling and maintenance
[801] . The lowest level of the supply chain management is con-
cerned with regulatory control and real-time optimization [802] .

9.1.3. Solution algorithms

The  methods  for  designing  and  operation  of  biofuel  supply
chains can be broadly classified into mathematical programming
and simulation-based studies [803] . In mathematical programming,
the involved decisions are represented using integer and continu-
ous variables. The integer (or binary) variables can be applied for
positioning  ( e.g.  mobile  pyrolysis  allocation)  and  interconnecting
the supply chain nodes (such as divergent, convergent, or multi-
nodal  interconnection).  They  can  also  refer  to  the  application  of
certain technologies or the selection of raw materials. Examples of
continuous variables include material, energy, money, and informa-
tion flows in the supply chain network, the capacities of produc-
tion sites, and storage rates. The optimization variables are con-
strained with respect to the availability of feedstock and desired
specifications of products as well as the performance of conver-
sion technologies, and the need to satisfy the demand. The math-
ematical models can also include time intervals that quantify the
response of the network to various sources of uncertainties such
as  demand,  energy  market  fluctuations,  availability  of  feedstock,
and price. By comparison, the scope of simulation-based studies
is much more limited and it focuses on the detailed dynamic op-
eration and control of certain configurations [790,791] . Since op-
timization programming has achieved wider application in design

and operation of biomass supply chain, we review this method in
more detail in the following sections.

A number of models have been presented in both mathematical
programming and simulation-based studies, and their most com-
mon feature is the use of linear and non-linear mixed integer op-
timization programs [804] . Indeed, mixed integer programming al-
lows users to analyze a wide range of configurations of the supply
chain to find the optimal solution. Researchers seem to disagree
on whether to use linear or non-linear programs. Non-linear pro-
grams allow users to deal with non-linearities, which are inherent
to the first principle models of industrial processes. However, the
non-linear models are restricted in their size due to the required
computational  effort  and  time  [805] .  This  limitation  is  more  se-
vere for the nonconvex formulations with the risk of the local so-
lution as the application of global optimization algorithms would
be necessary. For all these reasons, Mixed Integer Linear Program-
ming (MILP) is the most common approach to deal with supply
chain problems [806] . A typical MILP formulation is as follows:

Objective :
subjectto :

Min  f ( x, y )
h ( x, y ) =  0

g ( x, y ) ≤ 0
x ∈ R n ; y ∈ { 0 , 1 } m

Where x is the vector of continuous variables, such as the flow
of  materials  and  purchase  and  sales  of  products.  y  is  the  vec-
tor of the integer variables, which are employed to model tactical
and/or strategic decisions associated with the network configura-
tion, f ( x,y ) is the objective function to be minimized, h ( x,y ) is the
vector of equality constraints, and g ( x,y ) is the vector of inequal-
ity constraints. Only when all these functions are linear the prob-
lem can be solved with MILP solvers. An alternative approach is to
convert a nonlinear problem into an equivalent piece-wise linear
formulation [6] .

9.1.3.1. Decision variables and decision-making criteria.  It is crucially
important  to  clearly  define  the  scope  and  the  objectives  of  the
supply chain design and management. Such a complex structure
has three main implications: economical, environmental, and soci-
etal [807] . Melo and co-workers [808] reviewed 139 articles, and
identified  that  the  most  common  practice  was  to  define  a  sin-
gle  objective,  which  was  the  reduction  of  the  supply  chain  cost
(75%), followed by the maximization of the profit (16%), with only
9% of the remaining articles considering multiple objectives. The
optimization objectives can be multi-faceted and include various
economic, environmental, and societal impacts. Introducing green
policies into the supply chain management for environmental pro-
tection can potentially lead to economic benefits [809] . The most
common approach to evaluate environmental performance is the
life cycle assessment method [702] , which was first introduced in

supply  chain  studies  in  2001  [810] .  The  environmental  implica-
tions of biofuel production should be considered in an integrated
framework,  where  the  reduced  emissions  due  to  the  application
of biomass are considered in conjunction with carbon dioxide and
other greenhouse gases, emitted during upstream harvesting, han-
dling, and transportation [772,782] . The major social impact is job
creation [776,787] . The solution of a multi-objective optimization is
not a single solution but a Pareto front which quantifies the trade-
off between the competing objectives [752] .

9.1.3.2. Accommodating  uncertainties.  Zimmermann  [811]  defined
uncertainty as the amount of qualitative or quantitative informa-
tion from a system or its behavior that is not available in a certain
time period. He classified uncertainties into six categories of lack
of information, complexity or abundance of information, conflict-
ing evidence, ambiguity, measurement, and belief. From this defi-
nition, uncertainties during supply chain can arise at different lev-
els. Examples of such uncertainties include seasonal and geograph-
ical variations in the biomass supply as well as fuel price and de-
mand at the strategic level, equipment performance and failure at
the tactical level, and disturbances and fluctuations at the regula-
tory level. Tsiakis et al. [812] reviewed the probabilistic approach
and the scenario planning to deal with uncertainties. The proba-
bilistic approach consists of assigning a predefined probability dis-
tribution to all the parameters which are subject to uncertainty. In
contraposition, the scenario planning method is characterized by
the creation of representative scenarios that underpin the variables
subjected to uncertainty to a certain set of values at a certain time
interval. It is possible to map the solutions into a scenario tree and
it can be programmed as a MILP [813] . The aggregated value of the
objective function is calculated as the average of the objective val-
ues for various scenarios weighted by the likelihood of the corre-
sponding scenario. A number of examples of dealing with uncer-
tainties can be found in the literature [6,763,764,779,785,812] .

It is widely observed that deterministic supply chain manage-
ment  can  result  in  over  simplified  results.  Uncertainties  are  in-
trinsic  when  optimizing  supply  chains.  Using  average  values  of
biomass availability and price, product demand, and incentives/tax
policies  may  result  in  lower  profitability  or  higher  costs.  Of-
ten two-stage recourse-based stochastic optimization is employed,
which  has  the  ability  to  take  corrective  actions  after  the  real-
ization  of  scenarios  affected  by  the  uncertain  parameters  [814] .
With this approach, long-term design decisions ( e.g. constructing
processing facilities) are made in advance and the role of short-
term operational decisions ( e.g. processed materials) is to counter-
act or to take advantage of the realization of uncertain parame-
ters [764,806] . A number of uncertainties were reviewed by Awudu
and Zhang [815] including the uncertainty in raw material yield,
biomass to biofuel yield (due to the lack of information at indus-

trial scale), biofuel demand and price, or even governmental poli-
cies. Including various uncertainties in the optimization program-
ming results in an exponential growth of the problem size. The ap-
plication of scenario reduction methods is,therefore, recommended
[764] . It is also advisable to balance the impact of each uncertainty
and to choose intelligently which ones are more likely to have a
greater  impact  on  the  supply  chain  design  and/or  operation  be-
fore  developing  the  stochastic  model.  Nevertheless,  the  problem
size grows exponentially with each parameter considered as un-
certain, and therefore, there is a trade-off in terms of developing a
realistic problem that can be solved efficiently and being practical
about solving large-scale problems.

9.2. Future research directions

9.2.1. Flexibility and adaptability with various feedstocks

As reviewed, the economic viability of the biofuel production
depends on the price of the raw materials, which at the same time
depends on geographical and temporal conditions that are some-
times under limited control. Therefore, storage of biomass is a crit-
ical parameter that needs to be assessed, and which has received
little attention by researchers so far. Moreover, short-term storage
of intermediate products (such as bio-oil) needs also to be consid-
ered in an optimization problem, and more research is needed to
accurately account for the physical properties of the bio-oil com-
ponents over time, especially for the ones that suffer from degra-
dation. Also blending of bio-oils and conventional fuels need to be
considered further to improve the combustion properties and the
environmental footprint of bio-oil containing fuels.

9.2.2. Integrated planning, scheduling, and control

The current research frontier at the enterprise-wide scale is to-
ward seamless integration of planning, scheduling, and control . The
motivation  for  this  integration  is  that  the  main  concern  of  all
these three functions is dealing with uncertainties at different time
scales  [6,797,798] .  Examples  include  uncertainties  in  realization
of production targets, allocation of resources, constraint handling,
and disturbance rejection. Under uncertain conditions, intermittent
communication between different planning, scheduling, and con-
trol layers may result in suboptimal or even infeasible solutions.
However, the monolithic full-space integration results in extremely
difficult mixed-integer dynamic optimization problems. Therefore,
complexity reduction and enhancing computational capabilities re-
mains  a  frontier  in  research.  The  desired  framework  should  en-
able new paradigms such as distributed processing and power gen-
eration.  For  example,  mobile  pyrolyzers  or  skid-mounted  (remote)
biomass-to-liquid  converters  can  deliver  important  environmental
and energetic impacts by extending the supply chains to remote ar-
eas. These processes require simple operations with frequent start-
ups and shut-downs, with minimal help from control experts, or
options for remote control. Their incorporation into existing infras-
tructure requires seamless integration of control, scheduling, and
planning.

9.2.3. Integration with other supply chains

Biofuel supply chain optimization is a vibrant research field. Its
success is partly due to the development of new technologies to
convert biomass into biofuels more efficiently. Therefore, most of
the studies in the literature are devoted to optimization of the sup-
ply chain of a single biofuel, from a single type of biomass in a par-
ticular location and may fall in the classification of demonstrating
studies  of  development  technologies.  However,  the  scope  seems
too narrow compared with the potential of integrating the produc-
tion and distribution of all biofuels (and intermediates) from all
biomass resources, which is identified as a research opportunity.
Nevertheless, in the real world, the biofuel supply chain is a part

of the overall energy supply chain, where biofuels compete in the
same market as the conventional fuels and need to be considered
in an integrated framework.

10. Conclusions

The present paper extensively reviewed the field of biomass py-
rolysis and upgrading. The features of interest included the mech-
anisms  and  kinetics  of  the  chemical  reactions,  the  methods  ap-
plied for the characterization of pyrolysis products and interme-
diates,  and  the  design  of  (multi-)functional  catalysts  for  pyroly-
sis and upgrading. Furthermore, the conceptual process design in-
cluding the choice of feedstock, pretreatment technologies, design
and operation of pyrolysis and upgrading reactors, and the role of
phenomenological modeling in technology transfer was elaborated
and discussed. In addition, the review was strategic regarding the
economic and environmental impacts of pyrolysis technologies and
studied the broad scope of the biofuel value chain. For each of the
above-mentioned aspects, the state of the art was reviewed, and
promising future research areas were identified.

Nonetheless,  the  complex  multi-faceted  interactions  amongst
these aspects lead to commercialization of pyrolysis technologies
being a multi-scale multi-objective challenge. The authors propose
that addressing the following research gaps across the multi-scale
paradigm of biomass pyrolysis will potentially result in a break-
throughs of technological developments:

1. Analytical chemistry remains at the research forefront and will
have a key role in the development of new catalysts as well
as  characterizing  the  undergoing  phenomena  in  the  develop-
ment of pyrolysis reactors. In particular, characterization meth-
ods which can present a panoramic view of chemical entities
and capture the dynamic nature of their evolution throughout
the pyrolysis and upgrading reactions, as well as insights into
aging phenomena, have the potential to guide us all through
the multi-scale biomass pyrolysis commercialization effort.
2. Considering the profound impacts of chemical reactions on the
economic  and  environmental  performance  of  pyrolysis  tech-
nologies, catalyst development remains a key research frontier.
Design of multi-functional catalysts which can telescope the re-
action networks toward high-value fuels and chemicals will en-
hance the energy conversion efficiency, downsize the process
equipment in number and size and hence, can significantly re-
duce the capital investments and maximize profitability.

3. Nonetheless,  future  research  should  promote  the  flexibility,
durability, and reliability of the catalysts, to enable a new gen-
eration of pyrolysis technologies which are highly adaptable to
new  feedstocks  and  adjustable  to  variable  product  specifica-
tions.  The  research  into  pretreatment  technologies  should  be
orchestrated with the research into chemical reactions, in or-
der to enable the pyrolysis of unconventional feedstocks, with
emphasize on waste reduction and circular economy. Diversifi-
cation of pyrolysis feedstock enables adaptation of this technol-
ogy in various regions and countries.

4. The  true  economic  and  environmental  impacts  of  pyrolysis
technologies should be quantified in the context of the biofuel
supply chain and global energy network. This must include the
economic and environmental costs of biomass acquisition and
processing, as well as the distribution and consumptions of the
fuels and chemicals over their lifespan.

While the present review paper was focused on biomass-driven
feedstock,  the  pyrolysis  concept  has  widespread  application  and
could include non-renewable feedstocks such as coal, fossil-driven
wastes, tar sand, and petroleum heavy residues. The research find-
ings are therefore expected to be transferable to other analogous
industries.
