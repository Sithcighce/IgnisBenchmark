Plasma assisted combustion is a promising technology to improve engine performance, increase lean
burn flame stability, reduce emissions, and enhance low temperature fuel oxidation and processing. Over
the last decade, significant progress has been made towards the applications of plasma in engines and
the understanding of the fundamental chemistry and dynamic processes in plasma assisted combustion
via the synergetic efforts in advanced diagnostics, combustion chemistry, flame theory, and kinetic
modeling. New observations of plasma assisted ignition enhancement, ultra-lean combustion, cool
flames, flameless combustion, and controllability of plasma discharge have been reported. Advances are
made in the understanding of non-thermal and thermal enhancement effects, kinetic pathways of atomic
O production, diagnostics of electronically and vibrationally excited species, plasma assisted combustion
kinetics of sub-explosion limit ignition, plasma assisted low temperature combustion, flame regime
transition of the classical ignition S-curve, dynamics of the minimum ignition energy, and the transport
effect by non-equilibrium plasma discharge. These findings and advances have provided new opportu-
nities in the development of efficient plasma discharges for practical applications and predictive, vali-
dated kinetic models and modeling tools for plasma assisted combustion at low temperature and high
pressure conditions. This article is to provide a comprehensive overview of the progress and the gap in
the knowledge of plasma assisted combustion in applications, chemistry, ignition and flame dynamics,
experimental methods, diagnostics, kinetic modeling, and discharge control.

1. Introduction

1.1. Needs of combustion and emission control in extreme
conditions

More than 80% of world energy today is converted by combus-
tion. In air transportation, combustion has been playing a dominant
role because of the high energy density of liquid fuels and the
advantage in fast refueling. However, the energy conversion effi-
ciency of existing combustion engines is still low, and the com-
bustion of fossil fuels has become a major concern due to its
influence on climate change and air pollution [1].

For ground transportation, various new combustion engine
technologies such as the Homogeneous Charge Compression Igni-
tion (HCCI) engines [2e4], Partially Premixed Compression Ignition
engines (PPCI) [5], and the Reactivity Controlled Compression
Ignition (RCCI) engines [6] have been developed. These engines use
a higher compression ratio and lower combustion temperature to
increase engine efficiency and reduce emissions and heat losses.
However, at a high compression ratio and engine load, control of
ignition timing at low and intermediate temperature conditions
near the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) [7] region becomes
extremely difficult. Failure to accurately control ignition timing and
heat release rate may lead to either excessive unburned hydrocar-
bon emissions or engine knock. Although fuel stratification and duel
fuel combustion technologies have been demonstrated to be able to
control ignition, the use of multiple fuel pumping systems and
multi-pulse fuel injectors increases the complexity of ignition con-
trol over a broad engine loads. Therefore, there is a great need to
develop an alternative method with rapid control of engine ignition.

For air transportation, in order to increase the fuel efficiency and
meet the stringent emission standards of the Committee on Avia-
tion Environmental Protection (CAEP-6) and NASA (Nþ3), new lean
burn aircraft combustor concepts such as the twin annular pre-
mixing swirled (TAPS) lean-burn burners [8,9], lean direct injection
(LDI) burners [10], trapped vortex combustion (TVC) lean burners
[11], and pressure gain combustors [12] have been developed. One
of the biggest challenges in the development of lean burn engines is
flame instability. Therefore, it is important to develop a novel flame
stabilization method to achieve stable ultra-lean combustion. On
the other hand, the recent interest in supersonic propulsion, such
as for the X-51, has highlighted the increased challenge of ignition
control and flame stabilization under these conditions [13e15]. For
example, near flight Mach number 5, the flow residence time is so
short that the ignition and flame Damk€ohler numbers (respectively,
the ratio of flow residence time to ignition delay time and fuel
consumption time) are less than unity. As a result, there is not
enough time for the fuel to auto-ignite and to be oxidized
completely. Therefore, it is also necessary to develop new tech-
nologies to enhance ignition, stabilize flame, and to complete
combustion for scramjet engines.

For ground power generation and industrial burners, CO2 cap-
ture and NOx emission reduction are the primary drivers to the
development of ultra-lean high hydrogen content (HHC) gas tur-
bines [16,17], flameless combustion [18,19], and oxyfuel combus-

combustion, combustion instability and flame flashback are among
the greatest challenges. Another challenge is the broad distribution
of syngas energy density (5e80 MJ/kg) [21] that further increases
the problem of flame instability. For conventional flameless

combustion, the oxidizer temperature needs to be preheated to
1300e1400 K to achieve auto-ignition. As a result, the flameless
combustion technique is difficult to use in high pressure combus-
tors such as gas turbines due to material failure. The question is
whether we can develop a new ignition enhancement technique so
that the temperature of flameless combustion can be significantly
reduced. In oxyfuel combustion, excessive exhaust gas recirculation
(EGR) of CO2 is used to reduce NOx emissions from trace nitrogen.
Therefore, a reliable lean burn technology is needed for oxyfuel
combustion.

Furthermore, recent development of alternative and bio-derived
fuels to address energy sustainability and CO2 emissions further
complicates the combustion and emission control [1,22e24]. In
Europe, biogas produced from bio-wastes attracts great attention as
a renewable energy source for power generation. The EU Sustain-
able Bio-Fuel Jet Mandate targets 80% biofuel for aviation by 2050.
In the US, about 49 billion liters of corn ethanol and 4.1 billion liters
of biodiesel were produced in 2012. At the same time, unconven-
tional shale gas production reached one-third of the total US nat-
ural gas production. Oil production from tar sands, high hydrogen
syngas production from coal and biomass, synthetic aviation fuel
production from natural gas, coal and ethanol, and bio-oils from
plant oil and lignocellulosic biomass are also increasing [25e27].
These alternative fuels have completely different molecular struc-
tures and ignition properties from traditional transportation fuels
[28e32]. Moreover, biogas consists of trace amounts of hazardous
materials such as sulfur volatile organic compounds (VOCs), sili-
cone, and sulfur compounds [33]. Therefore, ignition and emission
control using biofuels and alternative fuels can be very challenging.
Moreover, the existing technology for fuel reforming and hydrogen
(H2) production from large hydrocarbon fuels using steam
reforming is very energy intensive and requires expensive noble
metal catalysts [34]. As such, an alternative method for fuel
reforming and hydrogen production is needed.

These new regulations and requirements have posed unprece-
dented challenges for combustion researchers to develop new en-
gine and fuel technologies to drastically increase the engine
efficiency, reduce emissions, and achieve extended flight envelopes
of high speed propulsion at extreme conditions [28,35].

1.2. Plasma assisted combustion: a new way to control combustion,
emissions, and fuel reforming

Plasma, which is the fourth state of matter, provides an un-
precedented opportunity for combustion and emission control
(Fig. 1.1) owing to its unique capability in producing active species
and heat and modifying transport processes. New reaction path-
ways, such as atomic O production from the collisions between
high energy electrons/ions and oxygen molecules, can be

introduced into combustion systems to modify the fuel oxidation
pathways considerably.

In last the two decades, plasma has been demonstrated as a
promising technique to enhance combustion, reduce emissions,
and improve fuel reforming [36e43]. In high speed propulsion such
as scramjet engines, since the pioneering work of Kimura et al. [44]
in 1980s, recent studies using plasma torch [41,45e50], filamentary
discharge [42,51], microwave discharge [52], low frequency arc
discharge [53], streamer high frequency (HF) discharge [54], sur-
face discharge [55], and nanosecond pulsed discharge (NSD) [56]
have showed that plasma can enhance ignition, flame stabiliza-
tion, and fuel/air mixing via chemical, thermal, and plasma induced
aerodynamic effects. Recent studies [57e62] have also demon-
strated that plasma discharge in pulsed detonation engines (PDE)
can shorten the ignition delay time, and facilitate the transition
from deflagration to detonation. In applications for gas turbine
engines, pulsed and steady plasma jets [63], gliding arc [64], DC
electric field [65], and HF streamer discharge [66,67] have been
tested to increase flame stabilization. The results have showed that
plasma discharge can extend lower lean blowout limit and lean
flammability limit. For internal combustion engines, successful
demonstrations of plasma assisted ignition and combustion have
been achieved by using microwave discharge [68e71], single and
multi-spark discharges [72], radio frequency discharge [73], laser
ignition [74e78], and corona and nanosecond pulsed discharge
[79e81].

In addition to combustion enhancement, plasma has also been
used in emission control [82]. By using a plasma jet [83], gliding
arcs [82], pulsed corona discharge [84e86], and dielectric barrier
discharge [87,88], extensive studies have shown that NOx emission
can be effectively reduced. Recent studies have extended plasma
emission control to remove SOx [82,89,90] and unburned hydro-
carbons (e.g., toluene and naphthalene) [91,92] in flue gas as well as
soot formation in the exhausted gas of diesel engines [93e96].

High hydrogen syngas, acetylene (C2H2), and formaldehyde
(CH2O) can also be produced from methane (CH4), large hydro-
carbons, and biofuels by low temperature plasma to accelerate the
non-equilibrium kinetic process for maximizing chemical yield.
Compared to conventional catalysts and steam reformers, plasma
reformers have the advantages of fuel flexibility, lower cost, high
energy efficiency, and being fast and compact [97]. Successful
demonstrations of plasma assisted hydrogen production from hy-
drocarbons have been conducted by using a thermal plasma [98],
gliding arcs [99e102], dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) [103,104],
microwave discharge [105], and nanosecond pulsed discharge
[106]. Recently, by using DBD and nanosecond pulsed discharge,
low temperature cool flames have been successfully stabilized to
reform large hydrocarbon fuels such as n-heptane (nC7H16) and
dimethyl ether (DME, CH3OCH3) to C2H4, CH2O, H2 and CO [107,108]
without carbon deposit.

Although the above studies have successfully demonstrated the
effectiveness of plasma in combustion and emission control as well
as fuel reforming, it remains unclear what kind of plasma is the best
option for combustion enhancement in a given environment.
Moreover, detailed plasma-combustion chemistry is not well un-
derstood. Quantitative kinetic modeling remains difficult even in
one-dimension. In addition, due to the large variation of plasma
properties and complicated interactions between plasma, com-
bustion chemistry, and transport processes and aerodynamics, it is
even more difficult to know whether the observed enhancement is
simply due to the thermal effect or favorably by the kinetic effect.
For example,
there has been a debate on whether a non-
equilibrium plasma discharge can kinetically enhance flame
speed and flammability limit or can only promote ignition. Many
controversial results have been reported. It is not clear what the

electron energy dependent. Therefore, the extent of combustion
enhancement by non-equilibrium plasma strongly depends on
plasma properties,
i.e., the electron temperature and electron
number density.

The electron temperature and number density of plasma are
governed by the reduced electric field (E/N, the electric field
strength divided by the molecular number density). A schematic
diagram of the averaged electron temperature and electron number
density is shown in Fig. 1.2 for different types of plasmas. More
detailed plasma characteristics are summarized in Table 1.

Among different types of plasmas, spark and arc discharges are
close to equilibrium plasmas. Spark discharge is an unsteady
process and occurs at a voltage above the breakdown level at
pressures generally above the atmospheric pressure. A fully
developed spark channel is a good conductor and has a large

discharge transforms into an arc. Therefore, spark and arc have a
high neutral gas temperature and electron number density, but a
low electron temperature. It consumes a large amount of energy
and has less kinetic enhancement effect in combustion compared
to non-equilibrium plasmas. On the other hand, non-equilibrium
plasma such as corona, DC, glow, RF, DBD, NSD, gliding arc, and
MW all have higher electron temperature [37]. Among them, NSD
can produce a very strong reduced electric field and allow energy
transfer mainly for electronic excitation and dissociation [37]. As
such, a nanosecond discharge is a highly non-equilibrium process
and has a high electron temperature to enable fast electron impact
dissociation in a large volume. For this reason, nanosecond plasma
has attracted increasing interest in plasma assisted combustion.
Corona is also a weakly ionized discharge appearing in the
neighborhood of an electrode, where the electric field is locally
enhanced and highly non-uniform. Ionization takes place only
locally and produces glow. As shown in Table 1, the electron
number density of corona is significantly low compared to
streamer and spark (arc) discharges. On the other hand, gliding arc
which has relatively lower electron temperature but reasonably
higher electron number density and neutral gas temperature
[38,111] also has wide applications in fuel reforming [82,89] and
flame stabilization [38], where large and continuous energy
deposition is needed. In non-equilibrium plasma, the energy dis-
tribution is highly non-Boltzmann. Due to the different degrees of
non-equilibrium in different plasmas, the energy transfer rate
between different energy excitation states in different plasmas are
also different. For example, the rotational-translational energy
transfer is very fast, and equilibrium between these two energy
modes usually can be reached with a few collisions. However,
vibrational-translational energy transfer is much slower, and
usually takes 103e108 collisions [36]. Therefore, the time scale for
combustion control has to be consistent with the timescale of
energy transfer. For example, in supersonic combustion, an in-
crease in rotational energy in plasma is necessary to accelerate the

and flame.

important kinetic pathways, radicals, and excited intermediate
species are in plasma assisted combustion. There are many unan-
swered fundamental questions behind the plasma “magic”. For
example, how is the kinetic pathway of plasma assisted combustion
dependent on plasma properties, temperature, and fuels? What is
the role of plasma if a fuel has low temperature chemistry? How
does plasma chemistry affect combustion chemistry and properties
and so on? As such, fundamental understanding of plasma prop-
erties and plasma assisted combustion chemistry in well-defined
physical and chemical conditions is necessary to answer these
questions.

1.3. Non-equilibrium plasma and the impact of plasma on
combustion

Plasma is a collection of neutral and charged particles which are
electrically neutral on average and exhibit collective effects. There
are two types of plasmas, one is the equilibrium plasma in which
the electron temperature, rotational and vibrational temperatures
of particles are in equilibrium and the neutral gas temperature and
electron number density are very high. The above mentioned
plasma torch and spark plugs belong to this category. The other is
the non-equilibrium plasma in which the electronic, vibrational,
and rotational temperatures are very different and the neutral gas
temperature and electron number density are relatively low.
Plasmas such as microwave discharge, DBD, gliding arc, streamer
discharge, and glow discharge belong to this category. Compared to
equilibrium plasma, non-equilibrium plasma has higher electron
temperature (1e100 eV) and is more kinetically active due to the
rapid production of active radicals and excited species via electron
impact dissociation, excitation, and subsequent energy relaxation

energy transfer to enhance ignition. Therefore, plasma assisted
combustion is also application dependent. To optimize plasma
assisted combustion,
is necessary to understand which
elementary process or what properties of plasma can generate the
greatest merits for combustion enhancement in each practical
application.

it

Due to a large difference in plasma properties, different plasmas
interact with combustion in different ways. Fig. 1.3 shows a sche-
matic of three major enhancement pathways of plasma interaction
with combustion. Since plasma produces heat, electrons, long-
lifetime intermediate species, radicals, ions, excited molecules,
fuel fragments, ionic wind, a large density gradient, and Coulomb
and Lorentz force, it affects combustion mainly via three different
pathways: thermal, kinetic, and transport (including aerodynamic).
In the thermal enhancement pathway, plasma increases tempera-
ture and accelerates chemical reactions and fuel oxidation ac-
cording to the Arrhenius law. In the kinetic enhancement pathway,
plasma produced high energy electrons and ions will further pro-
duce active radicals (e.g., O, OH, and H) via direct electron impact
þ
dissociation, ion impact and recombination dissociation (e.g., O2
þ
), and collisional dissociations of reactants with electroni-
and N2
cally excited (e.g., N2*, O2(1Dg)) and vibrationally excited (e.g.,
N2(v)) molecules. In addition, plasma can produce long-lifetime
reactive (e.g., ozone (O3)) and catalytic intermediate species (e.g.,
NO) which can accelerate low temperature fuel oxidation. Despite
many efforts in plasma assisted combustion research, quantitative
or even qualitative understanding of the kinetic enhancement
pathways has not been well-accomplished.
In the transport
enhancement pathway, plasma can breakdown the large fuel
molecules to small fuel fragments changing the fuel diffusivity and
thus modifying the combustion process [116]. Alternatively, the
ionic wind and the hydrodynamic and Rayleigh instabilities pro-
duced by plasma change the local flow velocity and increase the
flow turbulization and mixing. More importantly,
the three
different enhancement pathways often couple together and render
it difficult to understand the main mechanism of the plasma
assisted combustion. For example, the kinetic enhancement pro-
duces heat from the accelerated fuel oxidation to enhance the
thermal effect, and vice versa the thermal effect also accelerates the
kinetic processes. Similarly, the kinetic effect and thermal effect are
also both affected by the molecular and convective transport
induced or modified by the plasma discharge. Therefore, design of
well-defined experimental platforms with isolated enhancement
pathways and advanced diagnostics is extremely important to
assisted
understand the enhancement process of plasma
combustion.

combustion.

1.4. Progress and challenges in fundamental studies of plasma
assisted combustion

The earliest observation of electric field (plasma) interaction
with flames by applying an electric field to various flames goes back
to the work of Brande [117] in 1814. They found that flames were
attached to one of the electrodes due to the existence of charges in
the flames. Earlier observation of plasma assisted ignition was re-
ported by Haselfoot and Kirkby [118] in 1904. They found that an
electric discharge was able to ignite the mixture at low pressure
when otherwise it would not burn. In a later work, Kirkby [119]
applied an electric discharge to a low pressure H2/O2 mixture.
The chemical effect of H2O and atomic O formation was identified.
He also suggested that O collided with H2 to form H2O directly. In
1924, Southgate [118] applied an arc discharge to a flame front to
enhance the flame. More detailed work about the application of arc
discharges and plasma jets to flames was conducted in 1960s
[120,121]. Since then, arc discharge has been used widely in com-
bustion enhancement [44e46,48,50]. As shown in Fig. 1.2, since arc
discharge is equilibrium plasma and the temperature of a plasma
torch is as high as 10,000 K, the observed combustion enhancement
is dominated by the thermal effect (Fig. 1.3) and the energy con-
sumption of arc discharge is very high. Therefore,
thermal
enhancement by arc discharge is not an efficient way for combus-
tion enhancement because of the poor chemistry selectivity and
excessive thermal heating [118].

To find an energy efficient plasma to control combustion,
following the work of Brande [117], extensive attention was paid to
study the effect of electric field on flame dynamics and flame
chemionization. Earlier work by Lewis [122], Calcote [123] and
Wortberg [124] made significant progress in measuring the elec-
(cid:2)3) by using Langmuir probes
tron density in flame fronts (~1017 m
and in understanding the formation mechanism of negative and
þ
) in flames. It was found that a strong
positive ions (e.g., H3O
electric field increased flame speeds and improved stabilization
due to collisional energy transfer (heating) between electrons and
neutral molecules. At the same time, a strong electric field also
induced flow motion due to the collisions between positive ions
and neutral molecules [125]. The former effect was thermal and the
latter effect was termed “ionic wind.” By using a DC electric field,
quantitative measurements of the increases in flame speed and
flame extinction limits [125e127] as well as electron temperature
[128] via electric field flame interaction were conducted. It was
concluded that the increase in electron temperature and the ion
chemistry affected the combustion properties. When a strong
electric field was applied, it was found that the strong ionic wind
induced by an electric field increased the flame instability and
reduced the soot formation. Unfortunately, in these experiments,
the coupling between ionic wind and electron heating and ion
chemistry effects made it difficult to quantify the contributions of
individual enhancement pathways. In order to understand the
mechanism of the effect of an electric field on flame speed
enhancement and to suppress the effect of ionic wind, many ex-
periments since the 1970's have used high frequency electric field
such as HF (5e6 MHz) [129] and microwave discharges [130e133]
to study the interaction between electric field and flames. Unfor-
tunately, the earlier results in the 1970s were not conclusive as to
whether an electric field increased flame speed. Some studies re-
ported flame speed increase by 20% but others failed. The meth-
aneeair microwave flame experiments (200e500 W) by Ogawa
et al. [133] showed that although electron temperature linearly
increased with microwave field, increased burned gas temperature
was observed. A recent experiment and numerical simulation
[134e137] on microwave assisted combustion using high power
(2e4 kW) in a high Q microwave resonator demonstrated that the

26

Y. Ju, W. Sun / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 48 (2015) 21e83

flame speed of lean methaneeair mixture increased by approxi-
mately 20%. Both the numerical modeling [134] and laser di-
agnostics [137] showed that microwave absorption by the electrons
in the flame zone led to a flame temperature rise of about 200 K and
thus accelerated flame propagation. Unfortunately,
to avoid
microwave-flame front interaction, the intensity of the electric field
used had to be lower than the breakdown voltage. Therefore, both
the energy and density of electrons in microwave discharge were
low and a large portion of the microwave energy was absorbed in
the burned gas, leading to a very inefficient energy coupling be-
tween the flames and the electric field.

To increase the electric field and the electron number density for
the effectiveness of plasma assisted flame stabilization, gliding arcs
were tested in a counterflow diffusion flame to study extinction and
ignition of plasma assisted flame [38,138e140] by isolating the
complexity of flow field from plasma-combustion chemistry. The
results from this idealized platform showed that a gliding arc with a
moderate discharge power extended the flame extinction limit by a
factor of three. However, by quantitatively measuring the temper-
ature and OH distributions,
it was found that almost all the
enhancement was contributed by the thermal effect (Fig. 1.3). This
result raised a question of whether and at what conditions plasma
can have a kinetic effect on combustion enhancement. The authors
then extended their studies by comparing the ignition temperature
of hydrogen and methane with and without plasma [138,139]. It
was found that gliding arc discharge in air reduced hydrogen and
methane ignition temperature kinetically by more than 100 K via
the catalytic NOx reaction pathways.

Subsequent quantitative measurements of radicals formation of
nanosecond plasma discharge in counterflow diffusion flames
demonstrated that [43,106], although far less than the effect on
ignition, plasma still extended slightly the extinction limit via ki-
netic effect. These results prompted many questions on the
mechanism of plasma assisted combustion. First, why did gliding
arc have only primarily thermal effect for flames but have a large
kinetic effect on ignition? Does plasma really increase the flame
speed and flammability limit non-thermally (via kinetic pathway)?
If yes, what is the main mechanism? In addition, as shown in
Fig. 1.4, if plasma has a greater kinetic effect on ignition than on the
flame speed, can plasma accelerate ignition so fast that the ignition
S-curve will be changed into a monotonic curve and no flame
extinction limit will exist between ignition and flame (red dashed
line)? If this is true, different from the classical ignition S-curve
(blue line) [141e144], a new flame regime with a stretched ignition

Fig. 1.4. Schematic of the plasma assisted transition from the classical ignition and
extinction S-curve (solid blue line) to the monotonic stretched S-curve (red dashed
line) [145]. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the
reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

S-curve and continuous transition from ignition to flame (Fig. 1.4)
should be observed in plasma assisted combustion.

To prove the concept of the stretched S-curve transition by
plasma, an in situ nanosecond pulsed discharge (NSD) experiment
was conducted for a methane/air mixture in counterflow diffusion
flames. The experiments successfully demonstrated the plasma
ignition S-curve to the
assisted transition from the classical
monotonic stretched S-curve [144]. The S-curve transition in Fig. 1.4
due to plasma assisted ignition enhancement is equivalent to a
decrease of the activation energy of the global fuel oxidation re-
action at low temperature because plasma can provide new reac-
tion pathways to produce radicals faster than the fuel oxidation
chemistry alone. More recently, the S-curve transition and plasma
activated low temperature combustion were observed for dimethyl
ether (DME) flames [107]. This experimental finding clearly
demonstrated that although plasma can enhance both ignition and
flame extinction (flame speed) kinetically, the kinetic enhancement
to flame extinction (flame speed) is much less than that to ignition.
More importantly, ignition can be significantly enhanced kineti-
cally by plasma creating a new ignition to flame transition regime
without an extinction limit (Fig. 1.4). It is therefore necessary to ask:
what are the kinetic pathways of plasma to enhance ignition? How
does plasma enhance ignition if a fuel has low temperature
chemistry?

To understand the plasma assisted ignition chemistry, it is
necessary to produce a homogeneous plasma discharge and to
remove the non-uniform discharge effect. Significant progress was
made by the research group at the Moscow Institute of Physics and
Technology (MIPT) who introduced a discharge known as “Fast
Ionization Wave (FIW)” or NSD (nanosecond pulsed discharge)
[146] to combustion. NSD is generated by repetitive nanosecond
high voltage pulses and has a high reduced electric field (E/N) (up to
1000 Td). It provides uniform pre-ionization and efficient electron
impact dissociation at relatively higher pressure. NSD provided a
new research opportunity to understand the chemistry of plasma
assisted combustion. Shock tube NSD experiments were conducted
to measure the ignition delays of different fuels ranging from H2 to
C5 alkanes up to 2 atm [112]. Significant shortening of ignition delay
time by NSD discharge was observed. Different kinetic mechanisms
were also developed to model the plasma assisted ignition
enhancement. Despite the earnest efforts of this group, the exper-
imental results measured through optical emission spectroscopy
did not agree well with the simulated results. In addition, most of
the experiments have been focused on high temperature ignition.
The kinetic mechanism of plasma ignition enhancement at low
temperature was not well understood. Therefore, in order to un-
derstand the kinetic enhancement effects, time-resolved and in situ
experimental measurements of plasma generated radicals and in-
termediates at low temperature are greatly needed.

To address these challenges, in situ temperature and OH mea-
surements by NSD discharge in a rectangular quartz reactor were
conducted at different initial temperatures and reduced pressures
[39,147e149]. It was found that ignition temperature decreased by
about 200 K due to the accumulation of H atoms from H2 collisions
with electrons or excited N2. The studies suggested that plasma
discharge can have different kinetic effects for different fuels and
diluents. In situ NSD discharge in CH4/He/O2 [144] and DME/He/O2
[107] diffusion flames also showed that O atom production via
electron and helium ion (He
) impact dissociation of O2 played a
dominant role in ignition enhancement which led to the transition
to the stretched S-curve without an extinction limit (Fig. 1.4).

þ

More recently, focus of research in plasma assisted combustion
has been placed on low temperature ignition. This is an entirely
new research area of plasma assisted combustion. Using a coun-
terflow flame with NSD discharge, Sun et al. [107] demonstrated

Y. Ju, W. Sun / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 48 (2015) 21e83

27

that plasma can activate low temperature multi-stage ignition even
at reduced pressure. Starikovskiy et al. [150] conducted NSD
discharge in a Rapid Compression Machine (RCM) to study the
ignition kinetics at elevated pressures up to 40 bar and low tem-
perature regions (600 K-800 K). Two-orders of magnitude of igni-
tion delay reduction was
reported due to the streamer
development. Similar work of ignition enhancement by nano-
second pulsed surface dielectric barrier discharge in RCM was
conducted by Stepanyan et al. [151] Significant decrease of ignition
delays for methane and n-butane mixtures in the pressure range of
7.5e15 atm was observed. A transient streamer plasma discharge in
methane and ethylene (C2H4) [152] ignition was also conducted.
Ignition enhancement was reported. Unfortunately, in the above
experiments, due to spatial non-uniformity of discharge, the kinetic
pathways of ignition enhancement were not well understood. As
such, quantitative studies of the kinetic effect on combustion
enhancement by plasma generated radicals and intermediate spe-
cies on combustion in well-defined experimental platforms are
needed.

As shown in Fig. 1.3, plasma generated intermediate species,
radicals, and excited molecules can kinetically enhance combus-

O and other radicals, it was not certain whether O2(a1Dg) was the
only species causing the enhancement. The isolated effect of

O2(a

the effect of O3 and atomic O via NO quenching. The results showed

same method, the kinetic enhancement effect of O3 on flame speed
was reported [157]. The O3 enhancement of flame speed was also
observed in a flux burner [158,159]. More recently, it has been
discovered that O3 can enable stabilization of a self-sustained cool
flame for n-heptane (C7H16) [108]. These experimental results,
contrary to the previous results, have clearly indicated that O3 can
kinetically activate cool flame chemistry by releasing atomic O at a
low temperature. However, large discrepancies between the model
prediction and experiments have been found.

Since atomic O formation in plasma has a significant impact on
combustion, another major achievement in the fundamental study
of plasma assisted combustion has been the success of quantitative
diagnostics of atomic O. Uddi et al. measured the absolute atomic O
concentration in NSD discharges using the Two Photon Laser
Induced Fluorescence (TALIF) technique [160]. They found that O
was formed primarily from N2(A) collision with O2 and that atomic
O decayed much faster in fuel/air mixtures than that in pure air.
This indicated that atomic O production and its consumption by
hydrocarbon fuels and radicals are one of the primary pathways for
plasma assisted combustion. To further understand the formation
pathways of atomic O production by excited N2* (e.g., N2(A), N2(B)
and N2(C)) at a higher pressure, the absolute number densities of
N2(A, B, C) were measured by Cavity Ring Down Spectroscopy
(CRDS) and Optical Emission Spectroscopy in a NSD discharge at
atmospheric pressure in air [161]. Slightly different from the low
pressure results of [160], the results showed that O2 collisions with

N2(B) and N2(C) were the major reaction pathways to product
atomic O (probably due to the difference in pressure). These
quantitative measurements significantly advanced the under-
standing of plasma assisted combustion. Measurements of atomic O
production and consumption of NSD in a helium (He) diluted
oxidizer stream of counterflow diffusion flames was also measured
by Sun et al. [106] using TALIF. It was also found that NSD discharge
produced significant amount of atomic O via electron and helium
ion impact dissociation of oxygen. These findings support the
observation of improved flame stabilization of NSD discharge in a
turbulent flow [40,67,162,163].

Recently, diagnostics has been further advanced to use femto-
second TALIF for H radicals [164], picosecond CARS [165] for
vibrational states of nitrogen, mid-IR Faraday rotational spectros-
copy (FRS) [166,167] for HO2 and OH, and laser absorption for time
dependent measurements of C2H2, CH4, and H2O [168] in plasma
assisted combustion. As shown in Fig. 1.5, the above research has
provided a much better understanding of the electron impact
dissociation and radical production in the initial 100 ns plasma
discharge process and the kinetic coupling process for high tem-
perature ignition. However, the energy transfer and kinetic inter-
action between the plasma generated radicals and excited
molecules and the reactants at intermediate timescale and low
temperature region (100 nse1 ms and 300e900 K), at which low
temperature fuel oxidation pathways dominate, remains unclear.
The plasma interaction with cool flames is also poorly understood
[107,108]. The current plasma-combustion kinetic model cannot
predict key intermediate species at low temperature and high
pressure conditions. Many reaction pathways and rate constants
are still missing. Furthermore, producing uniform discharge at a
high pressure is still challenging. The transport of thermal energy
[169] and radicals/intermediates [170] produced from the local
plasma discharge needs to be investigated to understand the
mechanism of ignition and flame-holding at high pressure and low
temperature conditions. More fundamental studies of plasma
assisted combustion focusing on the kinetics at low temperature
and high pressure with in situ laser diagnostics and high level
quantum chemistry computations are needed.

1.5. Focus of this review

Three review articles respectively on the physics of plasma
discharge [37], the plasma kinetics and applications [36], and
ignition and development of plasma assisted combustion kinetic
mechanism [171] were published previously by the members of

former MIPT group. The first review emphasized on experimental
and theoretical analyses of various non-equilibrium plasmas and
their applications on ignition and combustion. The second review
paper expanded the first review by including applications in low
and high speed propulsion as well as discharge kinetics. The third
review covered the results obtained from 2006 to 2014 with a focus
on ignition study and developing a particular kinetic mechanism
for plasma assisted combustion. Although all reviews provided
excellent overviews of plasma assisted combustion from the view
point of plasma physics and kinetics, the underlying physics of
combustion dynamics and chemistry as well as advanced di-
agnostics were not emphasized. For example, questions such as
how and whether plasma can extend lean burn limit and change
minimum ignition energy were not answered. Moreover, the
question of how different the kinetic pathways and combustion
chemistry are for low and high temperature fuel oxidation in
plasma assisted combustion was not addressed. Furthermore, sig-
nificant progress in advanced laser diagnostics and combustion
kinetic mechanism development has been made. As such, this re-
view intends to discuss and summarize the progress and challenges
of plasma assisted combustion using the most recent experimental
results from combustion theory, flame dynamics, chemistry, and
advanced diagnostics. The goals of this review are to: 1) discuss
different enhancement pathways of plasma assisted combustion
and bridge the gap between combustion dynamics and chemistry
in plasma assisted combustion, especially for ignition, flame initi-
ation, propagation and flammability limit; 2) present the important
kinetic pathways in low,
intermediate, and high temperature
combustion and use them to explain the physics and chemistry for
plasma combustion enhancement in practical applications and
laboratory experiments; 3) provide a broad overview of funda-
mental phenomena and kinetic processes in plasma assisted com-
bustion experiments with well-defined boundary and discharge
conditions; 4) present the recent progress and findings made by
advanced laser diagnostic techniques and combustion theory; and
5) discuss the recent findings of plasma assisted low temperature
combustion and cool flames; and finally 6) discuss the challenges
and needs of future research in plasma assisted combustion.

2. Plasma assisted combustion: applications and
technological development

In the last two decades, many different plasmas including
plasma torch, dielectric barrier discharge (DBD), gliding arc, corona,
nanosecond pulsed plasma discharge, microwave, and lasers have
been widely tested and applied in high speed propulsion systems,
internal combustion engines, industrial burners, and reactors to
control ignition, flame holding, flame stability, lean burn, emis-
sions, and fuel reforming. Table 2 below lists the types of plasma
and combustors, merits of combustion enhancement, technical
difficulties and challenges, references, and the names of
in-
stitutions. In the sections below, the details of major research ef-
forts, results and progress, challenges, and future directions will be
reviewed and discussed for high speed propulsion, internal com-
bustion engines, emission control, and fuel reforming.

2.1. Plasma assisted combustion for supersonic propulsion and
scramjet engines

The major challenges in supersonic ramjet engines for hyper-
sonic propulsion are fuel/air mixing, ignition, flame stabilization,
and cooling [13,190]. At a high Mach number, the flow residence
time in the engine (tflow ~ 0.5 ms) is even shorter than the typical
auto-ignition time of jet fuels (tig ~1e2 ms) at 900 K [191]. More-
over, even when the fuel is ignited, the flow residence time may still

be shorter than the time for the fuel to be completely combusted
(tc). Therefore, both the ignition and combustion Damk€ohler
numbers are less than unity.

In addition, if the combustion heat release is too fast, the rapid
heat release rate may cause thermal choking of the flow and lead to
an engine unstart. Therefore, it is necessary to control both ignition
and combustion heat release rate. Plasma torch or plasma jet has
been extensively studied as an effective method to ignite and sta-
bilize flame at supersonic conditions [36,41,44e51]. Plasma torch is
an equilibrium arc discharge and is considered to enhance ignition
due to the thermal effect and abundant active radicals. The
extremely high temperature (up to 10,000 K) of the plasma torch
makes the thermal effect overwhelm the kinetic effect.

The earliest attempt to use plasma torch to enhance ignition in a
supersonic flow was conducted by Kimura et al. [44]. Since then, a
large number of experimental studies have been carried out to
control ignition in a supersonic flow by using different plasma
torches and feedstocks [41,45e50,192]. For example, Takita and co-
workers [41] developed a plasma igniter consisting of one and two
plasma torches with different plasma feedstocks (e.g., H2/N2/O2)
and fuels (e.g., H2, CH4, and C2H4). The experiment was conducted
using an intermittent suction-type wind tunnel. The plasma torch
was tested in a supersonic flow of Mach number (M) 2.3. Fig. 2.1
[192,193] shows the successful H2 ignition by a plasma torch in a
Mach 2.3 supersonic flow and the effect of total heat addition (the
sum of electrical energy of plasma and the injected H2 enthalpy
flux) on pre-combustion shock wave (PSW). It can be seen that with
the increase of H2 mole fraction and plasma power (Fig. 2.1(a) and
(b)), combustion became stronger and resulted in an increased
strength of PSW (an increased possibility of engine unstart). By
using twin plasma torches together with upstream and down-
stream fuel injections, both H2 and CH4 flame stabilization were
achieved. Moreover, to understand the kinetic enhancement by
plasma generated radicals and NOx, the effect of different plasma
feed-stocks using H2/N2/O2 for the twin plasma torches was also
studied [47]. Numerical analysis showed that the addition of a small
amount of NOx by plasma drastically reduced ignition delay time of
H2 and hydrocarbon fuels at a relatively low initial temperature. In
particular, it was shown that plasma produced NOx was more
effective than atomic O radicals for ignition enhancement of CH4.
Ignition tests by a N2/O2 plasma torch at Mach 1.7 showed that the
ignitability of the N2/O2 plasma torch was affected by the compo-
sition of the feedstock and that pure O2 was not the optimum
feedstock for ignition with downstream fuel injection.

Recently, Matsubara et al. [181] extended the plasma torch
ignition by combining it with a Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD)
in a supersonic flow. As shown in Fig. 2.2, H2 was injected upstream
of a back-step flame holder. The non-equilibrium DBD discharge
produces radicals through the kinetic pathways (Fig. 1.3) at the
back-step recirculation zone. The thermal N2 arc plasma jet was
issued from a flat wall at the downstream of the back-step flame-
holder to stabilize the flame. Fig. 2.2 shows that non-equilibrium
DBD plasma was successfully generated in a supersonic flow at
M 1⁄4 2.0 with maximum power consumption of about 8 W. It was
found that the minimum peak-to-peak amplitude of the applied
sinusoidal voltage of DBD, Vpp, to initiate DBD decreased with the
increase in the flow Mach number (M) due to the decreased static
pressure (about 55, 13, and 6 kPa in M 1⁄4 1.0, 2.0, and 2.5,
respectively).

Fig. 2.3 shows the dependence of the minimum Vpp on the flow
Mach number and the comparison with the results of the same DBD

discharge in a low pressure desiccators without a flow. Ignition
tests were conducted in an M 1⁄4 2.0 supersonic flow. It was
confirmed that ignition did occur by only operating the DBD
discharge. On the other hand, the wall pressure measurements
showed that with a high plasma torch power at Pin 1⁄4 4.05 kW,
strong combustion occurred, but no combustion enhancement was
observed by adding the DBD. However, for relatively weak and
unstable combustion at a lower plasma torch power, significant
enhancement was obtained when the fuel was injected upstream of
the DBD device. It was shown that the wall pressure distribution of
plasma torch at Pin 1⁄4 2.4 kW with DBD operation was almost
equivalent to that at Pin 1⁄4 3.8 kW without DBD operation, indi-
cating a significant drop of total electrical energy consumption with
combined plasma discharge. This experiment suggests that thermal
effect is needed to stabilize a flame in a high speed flow and non-
equilibrium plasma can kinetically enhance flame stabilization
near its stabilization (or extinction) limit when there is sufficient
thermal effect from the plasma torch. The authors explained this
observation through O3 effect from the DBD device. However, the
verification of the existence of O3 was not conducted.

Do et al. [182] integrated a nanosecond pulsed discharge with a
wall cavity and investigated the ignition of H2 and C2H4 jet flames
in a supersonic crossflow. An expansion tube was used to generate
conditions comparable to those of the supersonic flow in the
combustor of a scramjet engine. The schematic of the experimental
design mimicking a supersonic combustor in a scramjet engine is
shown in Fig. 2.4. The discharge consists of a rectangular aluminum
plate with inject nozzle and electrodes, and a ceramic plate

electrodes. The electrodes were 2% thoriated tungsten rods with
1 mm diameter. Non-equilibrium plasma was used to generate
reactive species at a lower temperature. The discharge was pro-
duced by repetitive pulses of 15 kV peak voltage, 20 ns pulse width
and 50 kHz repetition rate between the two electrodes. Sonic fuel
jets were impinged into the free stream air at Mach number be-
tween 1.7 and 3.0. Flame stabilization was found to be improved by
the plasma discharge.

Fig. 2.5 provides a comparison of auto-ignition cavity flames
and plasma assisted cavity flames at two different flow conditions.
The images in the presence of the plasma were taken 1 ms after a
discharge pulse and approximately 200 ms after the start of the test
time. The plasma was turned on well before the beginning of the
test time. Here, Jn (Fig. 2.5) is the cross jet momentum ratio, the

comes from the 30(cid:3) injection relative to the free stream flow di-
rection. The plasma enhanced cavity flames seen in Fig. 2.5(b) and
(d) clearly appeared to extend into the free stream flow on the
leeward side of the fuel jet. The results showed that the pulsed
plasma in the cavity served as a source of both heat and radicals,
shortening the ignition delay time of the well mixed flammable
mixture. In a marginal case with M 1⁄4 2.0 and stagnation enthalpy
~2.0 MJ/kg, H2 jet auto-ignition was observed within the test time
which is about 500 ms only with plasma enhancement. A simple
model was also employed to simulate the experiments. The au-
thors concluded that the reduction of the ignition delays was due
to H and atomic O through electron impact dissociation of H2
and O2.

To reduce the pressure loss and eliminate the coupling between
cavity and plasma discharge, Do et al. [182] further conducted the
flame-holding experiments with plasma discharge in a supersonic
crossflow without a cavity. Subsonic (upstream) and sonic (down-
stream) fuel (H2 and C2H4) jets were injected into a pure oxygen
free stream of M 1⁄4 1.7e2.4. The configuration of duel fuel jet in-
jection with plasma in between can couple the plasma energy into
the activation of the upstream subsonic fuel/oxidizer mixture that
served as a pilot flame that subsequently anchored the ignition of
the main supersonic flame downstream. Radical production by this
pilot flame can be several orders of magnitude more than that by
the discharge alone. The observed flame stabilization enhancement
is shown schematically in Fig. 1.3, indicating that both thermal ef-
fect (cavity or pilot flame) and kinetic effect are needed for flame
holding in a supersonic flow. However, in both experiments it was
not discussed at what temperature range and flow residence time
this kinetic enhancement is most effective. It was not clear whether
the observed enhancement is due to the ignition shortening or due
to the flame speed increase.

Leonov et al. [184] developed an experimental platform of
plasma assisted supersonic combustion by integrating multi-
electrode quasi DC discharge (similar to gliding arc) behind a
back-step cavity in H2 and C2H4 with air mixtures (Fig. 2.6). The
discharge dynamics in flow behind the back-step and in the cavity
was explored. It was found that the discharge effect on the flow
structure in the cavity and behind the back-step lied in that an
intensive turbulization of gas in the interaction area and simulta-
neously slight increase of the separation zone volume. The direct

photographs of
the multi-electrode discharge and associated
combustion are shown in Fig. 2.7. With H2 injection, the combus-
tion took place in the cavity as well as in the shear layer. For C2H4,
combustion was only detected in the cavity. The authors proposed
three mechanisms for high-speed combustion control: plasma-
induced ignition, plasma-intensified mixing, and flame-holding
by plasma generation.

Leonov et al. [183,185] further conducted experiments on
plasma-induced H2 and C2H4 ignition and flame holding by means
of near-surface electrical discharges in M 1⁄4 2 flow. The modified
experimental setup is shown in Fig. 2.8. The fuel injectors were
located downstream of the plasma generator on a distance that was
less than the plasma filament length. The injectors were arranged
at the same position as the electrodes for the most intensive air-
plasma interaction with the fuel jet. Fuel injection was started
prior to the discharge initiation and was switched off after
completion of the discharge. The discharge appeared in the form of
oscillating plasma filaments. The individual filaments were blown
down due to the main flow at a velocity that was a bit less than the
core value. It was found that the flame could only exist in the
presence of the plasma. The authors proposed a two zone model of
plasma induced ignition to explain the experimental data. In zone 1,
the cold combustion took place accompanied by plasma induced
fuel conversion and relatively small heat release. In zone 2, com-
bustion was completed or almost completed with high energy
release. The plasma launched the cold combustion inside zone 1
owing to the generation of high amounts of active species. The

lengths of zone 1 in the tests were measured by Schlieren technique
in the range from 50 to 150 mm, which corresponded to the in-
duction time range from 0.1 to 0.3 ms. However, the transition
mechanism of plasma assisted ignition to strong combustion in
zone 2 was not well understood. It might be the classical auto-
ignition to flame transition or the stretched ignition to flame
transition without extinction limit. More quantitative diagnostics is
necessary. The authors are conducting species measurements by
using tunable diode-laser absorption (TDLAS). The results may give
a clearer picture of the mechanism.

Esakov et al. [186] studied microwave assisted combustion of
C3H8/air in a supersonic flow. The experimental setup is shown in
Fig. 2.9. The steady state airstream was formed at the outlet of the
nozzle with M 1⁄4 2 and a static pressure of 100 Torr, static tem-
perature of 150 K, and stream velocity of 490 m/s. The free stream
stagnation conditions were 550 Torr and 300 K. A deeply under
critical discharge was created by an incident electromagnetic
beam with electric field (E) much smaller than the critical break-
down field. In order to create a local electric field which was larger
than the critical breakdown field to initiate the discharge, a pas-
sive electrodynamic vibrator was used and the discharge was
initiated in the base of the electromagnetic vibrator, which was
immersed in cold supersonic airflow. A linearly polarized beam of
electro-magnetic radiation with a wavelength of 12.5 cm, power
1.5 kW and a typical transverse size 9 cm was introduced
perpendicular to the screen surface. A C3H8 or C3H8/air mixture
was injected through internal tubes in the pylon and vibrator. The
stream velocity on the stream axis was approximately 200 m/s.
The experiments demonstrated that the use of a deeply under
critical microwave discharge can be used to effectively increase
the combustion efficiency of C3H8/air mixture in cold supersonic
flow. Stable operation of a hot combustion torch in a supersonic
stream in steady state was achieved. However, it was not clear
whether the flame stabilization was enhanced by the arc discharge

or by the electron energy absorption of microwave at the flame
front.

More recently, Brieschenk et al. [187] has reported experimental
investigation on laser induced plasma ignition in a model scramjet
engine for the first time. The experiments were conducted in the T-
ADFA free piston shock tunnel using a flow condition with a total
specific enthalpy of 2.7 MJ/kg and a free stream velocity of 2075 m/
s. The scramjet model features a rectangular duct with a 9(cid:3)
compression ramp, followed by a constant-area combustor. H2 is
injected through four 2 mm diameter holes located on the
compression ramp of the model, which are distributed across the
compression ramp, 120 mm downstream of the leading edge. The
laser induced plasma is formed by a Q-switched ruby laser with
pulse energies of 750 mJ (only about 54% of the laser energy was
absorbed). The location of the plasma is in the shear layers 1.7 mm
downstream of the injectors. The temporal evolution of the laser
induced plasma ignition region was monitored using OH PLIF
technique. Hydroxyl radical
formation was successfully
(OH)
observed. However, the subsequent ignition and flame propagation
events were not reported.

In summary, plasma activation can enhance ignition and flame
stabilization in a high speed flow through both thermal and kinetic
effects. However, due to strong turbulent mixing (heat/radical loss)
and short flow residence time (requiring a very short ignition delay
time and fast heat release rate), combustion enhancement using
non-thermal plasma alone is extremely challenging. A combination
of both thermal and non-thermal plasmas such as the gliding arc/
microwave and plasma jet/DBD discharge might be more effective
for high speed applications. As such, the kinetic mechanism to
optimize the combination of thermal and non-thermal plasmas
needs to be understood. Furthermore, the introduction of plasma
discharge may significantly modify the flow field. The effect of flow
perturbation by plasma in affecting ignition and flame stabilization
in high speed flow also needs to be addressed.

NSD [81], and gliding arc [197] have been used to replace or inte-
grate with a conventional spark plug. A schematic of the integration
of different plasmas with a conventional spark plug and a com-
parison of spark sizes are shown in Figs. 2.10 and 2.11, respectively.
Fig. 2.11 shows that using a gliding arc and microwave discharge at
the same pressure of 1 MPa the ignition kernel sizes are much
greater than that of the conventional spark plug.

Ikeda and collaborators developed and tested a microwave in-
tegrated spark igniter [68,69] that can be applied to existing engine
systems without any engine modification. As shown in Fig. 2.10,
microwave discharge at a frequency of 2.45 GHz was generated by a
commercial magnetron into a non-resistor spark plug which has
the same geometry as that of a conventional spark plug. The two
electrodes of the spark plug also acted as a microwave antenna. The
microwave system operated in burst mode, in which a series of
pulses of 2.45 GHz microwave energy were delivered to the spark
plug starting before and ending after the standard spark. The mi-
crowave energy was then absorbed by the electrons formed by the
spark between the two electrodes that raised the electrons to a
higher temperature. These electrons collided with the gas mole-
cules and raised the gas temperature and created excited species
and active radicals. In an earlier work [198], the rotational tem-
perature and N2 density were measured by rotational Raman
scattering in the region of the microwave discharge. It was shown
that at a microwave power less than the ignition energy of a spark
plug, the rotational temperature raised to a maximum of 1500 K in
a nitrogen/helium mixture by microwave.

ignition and microwave plasma ignition with C3H8 at the fuel and
equivalence ratio of F 1⁄4 1. In the case of using a normal spark plug,

engines

Over the last decade, plasma assisted combustion has attracted
increasing attention for applications in internal combustion en-
gines such as gasoline and diesel engines [68e81], gas turbine
engines [63,64], pulsed detonation engines [36,37,58e62], and lean
burn combustion systems [37,45,51e56,66,67,194,195]. In spark
ignition (SI) engines, the development of the initial spark ignition
kernel size strongly influences the lean burn limit and emission
characteristics. A larger ignition kernel size can extend the lean
burn limit for large hydrocarbon fuels [196]. In order to improve the
ignition of SI engines, different plasmas such as microwave [68,69],

spark discharge was observed at (cid:2)14.2(cid:3) after top dead center
(ATDC). The flame kernel was formed at (cid:2)7.0(cid:3) ATDC, and then the
flame propagated at (cid:2)0.2(cid:3) ATDC. With the microwave enhanced
spark plug, intense light from the plasma was observed shortly after
spark ignition. Then, a large flame kernel was formed by the mi-
crowave energy addition at 0.2(cid:3) ATDC.

The microwave enhanced spark plug was further tested using a
499.6 cc, four-stroke- single cylinder gasoline research engine at a
constant indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) of 275 kPa and
2000 rpm. The effects of the microwave enhanced spark plug on the
lean limit, fuel consumption, and exhaust emissions were evalu-
ated. The results are shown in Fig. 2.13. With a spark plug igniter, at
air/fuel mass ratio (A/F) of 17, the cyclic variation coefficient of IMEP
(COVIMEP) increased dramatically, indicating close to the lean limit
of the engine. In contrast, with the microwave enhanced spark plug,
the COV remained essentially constant until A/F 1⁄4 22. Moreover,
MW also reduced the fuel consumption (FC) and CO emissions for
A/F greater than 18.

Wolk et al. [70] further investigated the performance of the
microwave enhanced spark plug in a 1.45 L constant volume
combustion chamber at a range of initial pressures and equivalence
ratios. The microwave energy input in this study was approxi-
mately 225 mJ. The flame development time (FDT, time for 0e10%
of total net heat release) and the flame rise time (FRT, time for
10e90% of total net heat release) [70] were used to characterize the

early and the late stage heat release of the combustion. The effec-
tiveness of microwave addition on extending the lean and rich
ignition limits was experimentally investigated for initial pressures
ranging from 1.08 to 7.22 bar and 300 K for methane/air mixtures.
As shown in Fig. 2.14(a), SI þ MW (Spark Ignition þ Microwave)
ignition resulted in lower FDT for all equivalence ratios compared
to the SI ignition. Greater enhancement was observed at the leaner
conditions than the rich conditions. Fig. 2.14(b) shows that no
enhancement of the FRT was observed at any equivalence ratio,
indicating that although a more robust ignition event can be ach-
ieved with the addition of microwaves, subsequent flame propa-
influenced due to the small energy addition.
gation is not
Correspondingly, there was no effect on the total heat release with
microwave addition as far as ignition can occur.

The pressure dependence of the effectiveness of the microwave
addition on extending the lean and rich ignitability limits and FDT
was also investigated. Fig. 2.15 compares the ignition limits versus
initial pressure with and without microwave addition for initial
pressures ranging from 1.08 to 7.22 bar and 300 K. It can be seen
that the ignition limits are both extended at the lean and rich limits
with microwave use. Note that Fig. 2.15 might leave readers some
impression that the enhancement of rich limit is greater than that
of the lean limit. In fact, the effect is opposite. This is because of the
definition of equivalence ratio. The flame temperature decreases
much faster on the lean side than on the rich side. By considering

Fig. 2.14. the SI and SI þ MW modes as a function of equivalence ratio at an initial pressure of 1.08 bar and 300 K (a) for FDT, (b) for FRT [70].

The MW assisted ignition system was also tested for small en-
gines which are affected more by the spark ignition energy and
radicals losses to the engine wall due to the increased surface/
volume ratio. A single cylinder, 34 cc 4-stroke gasoline engine (Fuji
Imvac Model BF-34EI) is shown in Fig. 2.16 [69]. It was found that
the microwave enhanced spark ignition produced a larger ignition
kernel and led to an overall faster ignition and increase of the peak
pressure with about 750 mJ MW energy output (1/4 to 1/3 of that
energy is reflected back). By comparison, only less than 50 mJ en-
ergy was deposited by the standard capacitive spark plug. As shown
in Fig. 2.16, the experimental results of COVimep showed that the
lean burn limit was extended by 20e30% in terms of the air/fuel
ratio. Moreover, for the conventional spark plug the minimum fuel
consumption occurred at fuel lean conditions of A/F 1⁄4 17e20,
where there was a significant miss fire. The results suggested that
the microwave enhanced spark plug is an effective way to improve
lean burn for micro and mesoscale engines [199].

Using the same small engine as Lefkowitz et al. [69], Thelen at al
[173]. investigated the effect of a radio frequency (RF) plasma
ignition system. The RF power generator pulses at 20 kHz and the
output pulses are a burst of alternating high (30 kV) and low (0 V)
voltage square waves with 25 ms width. The maximum pulse burst
duration was 1.2 ms with the RF system providing maximum
amount of energy of 400 mJ to the discharge. The engine was tested
at multiple engine speeds and air fuel ratios. The results also
demonstrated an improvement in combustion stability at all
operating conditions and an extension of the engine lean flam-
mability limit. It was reported that the power output of the small
engine was also higher with the RF plasma ignition system for
stoichiometric and leaner air fuel ratios and the HC emissions was
reduced. However, NOx emissions increased owing to higher flame
temperatures and additional NOx formation pathways introduced
by the plasma.

The USC (University of Southern California) group has devel-
oped various transient plasma igniter using corona and nanosecond
discharge [79e81] for gasoline engines. The schematic of the
nanosecond transient plasma igniter is shown in Fig. 2.17. The
transient plasma was generated by applying high voltage short
pulses (20e85 ns) that had energy (~60 mJ) comparable to that of
the conventional spark igniter (~2 ms, 80 mJ). The transient plasma
igniter can create a large volume of distributed arrays of streamers

the same flame temperature, it can be interpreted from Fig. 2.15
that the enhancement of the lean side is greater than that of the
rich side. The experiments also showed that for methane/air mix-
tures at F 1⁄4 0.65, 0.75 and 1.0, the reduction of FDT by microwaves
decreased with the increase in initial pressure for all equivalence
ratios and the enhancement effect became negligible when the
initial pressure was greater than 3 bar.

Wolk's experiments raised several important and interesting
questions. Why did microwave use have more enhancement effect
in oxygen rich conditions than in fuel rich? Why was the extension
of the lean limit greater than that of the rich limit with the same
flame temperature? Why did plasma enhance ignition kernel
development time greatly but only slightly for flame rise time
(flame speed)? Why did the enhancement decrease with the in-
crease in pressure? The authors concluded that the observed de-
creases in flame enhancement were due to the decrease in E/N as
the pressure increased. As will be discussed in the next section, E/N
is not the major cause of the decreased effect.

time scales via electron impact fuel and oxygen dissociation.

It was found that by using a transient plasma igniter (TPI), the
ignition delay time can be improved. When a 20 ns pulse was used,
stable lean combustion was realized at conditions not ignitable by a
spark plug. It was also found that the peak pressure relative to spark
ignition increased by 20% using a 20 ns pulse transient plasma
igniter. High speed imaging illustrated in Fig. 2.18 shows that the
transient plasma igniter generated faster flame speeds than the
spark ignition. The authors inferred that during the initial phase of
ignition, the initiation reaction RH þ O2 / R þ HO2, where RH is a
hydrocarbon fuel molecule, is replaced by fuel and O2 dissociation
reactions, RH þ e / R þ H þ e and O2 þ e / 2O þ e. Shiraishi et al.
[81] further investigated ignition characteristics in the lean com-
bustion region and the relationship between the pulse width and
ignition characteristics. The TPI used in this study operated at 80 ns
or 25 ns pulse width with a fixed input energy of 60 mJ. The test fuel
was a 90 research octane number (RON) primary reference fuels
(PRF, a mixture of 90% iC8H18 (iso-octane) and 10% nC7H16 (n-
heptane) in volume). Since the decrease of pulse width from 80 ns
to 25 ns made the arc transition more difficult, the maximum
voltage of the streamer discharge at the same pressure condition
was increased, leading to an increase in E/N by roughly 30e40%.
The results indicated that a shortened pulse width produced even
faster combustion [81]. The USC group also examined the effects of

electrode geometry on the transient plasma induced ignition [79]
at atmospheric pressure with a variety of fuels. Amongst all the
electrode configurations, the needle-to-semicircle, the authors re-
ported, resulted in the best performance by providing a sheet of
transient plasma that was uniformly distributed over the gas
volume.

The ignition mechanism of transient plasma ignition was
investigated by Cathey et al. [152] in a quiescent, stoichiometric
CH4/air mixture by measuring the OH production in a large cylin-
drical chamber with the anode rod located in the center. The
transient plasma is generated using a 70 ns FWHM, 60 kV, 800 mJ
pulse. The total time for avalanche development, avalanche to
streamer development and streamer propagation between the
electrodes is typically 100e300 ns. Using a short high voltage pulse
(<100 ns) in this experiment, energy is effectively coupled into a
non-equilibrated plasma without a transition from the streamer to
the arc discharge [152]. The number density of OH was measured
using Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF). It was found that
OH was produced throughout the chamber volume after the
discharge and decreased below detectability near 100 ms. Ignition
occurs along the surface of the anode around 1 ms and propagates
outwardly with a wrinkled cylindrical flame front. The results
showed that the production of OH by the streamers in the bulk of
the volume was not the cause for ignition because of the low energy
release. The authors suggested that a high voltage to produce OH

throughout the chamber was not, apparently, critical for ignition.
The authors further explained that it was possible due to an elec-
trically enhanced surface catalytic reaction at the anode surface
and/or local joule heating of the electrode. Different from the MW
experiment, the TPI experiment indicated that the thermal effect
played an important role in the enhancement of ignition and that
the OH production by streamer affected the flame propagation.
Therefore, it is not clear whether kinetic enhancement can enhance
ignition or the flame speed.

Singleton et al. [81] recently modified the system and studied
the ignition enhancement in C2H4/air mixture using transient
plasma at 1 atm initial pressure. The center electrode was short-
ened and the discharge was produced between parallel electrodes
rather than between the center electrode and chamber wall as in
the previous experiments. The mixture equivalence ratio was
F 1⁄4 1.1. As shown in Fig. 2.19, at atmospheric pressure using a co-
axial electrode configuration with constant gas distance, multiple
flame kernels were formed along the anode as the bases of the
streamer channels after the transient plasma discharge. The
plasma-ignition process had two distinct phases. First, an initial
non-equilibrium phase where energetic electrons transfer energy
into electronically excited species. This phase accelerates fuel
molecule dissociation. Second, a spatially distributed thermal
phase that produces exothermic fuel oxidation. The heat release
from fuel oxidation results in ignition approximately 1 ms after the
discharge. Temperature measurement using rotational profile of
the N2 (C3Pu, n0 1⁄4 0) / N2 (B3Pg, n00 1⁄4 2) transition at 380 nm
showed that up to 100 ns after the discharge, the temperature in

the streamer channel was close to room temperature. This indicates
that the initial plasma process was non-thermal. However, the
radical pools generated in the high E/N transient plasma discharge
accelerated the initial chain branching reactions to ignition. Un-
fortunately, the detailed processes were not clear. Fig. 2.20 shows
the comparison of flame propagation between spark ignition and
TPI. In TPI, the initial flame kernels passed through the holes on the
wall of the concentric cathode forming a clover-shaped flame front,
in contrast to the hemispherical smooth flame front in the spark-
ignited case. An average flame propagation speed of TPI was 15%
more than that of spark ignition. However, it was not clear whether
the increase of flame speed was solely due to flame wrinkling or
there was any enhancement effect on flame speed.

Laser as another high temperature ignition source for internal
combustion engine has been tried for gasoline and natural gas en-
gines for a number of years by Toyota, Ford, Caterpillar, and Cum-
mins engines [74e78]. It has been reported that laser ignition was
able to ignite leaner mixtures with NOx reduction. The fundamental
mechanisms for laser ignition can be summarized as (1) Thermal
ignition in which molecules absorb photon energy and increase
temperature;
ignition in which molecules
dissociate or are ionized after absorbing multiple photon energy; (3)
resonant breakdown in which dissociation and ionization of target
molecules or atoms by the resonant multi-photon ionization pro-
cess; and (4) non-resonant thermal breakdown occurs when the
focus laser power is sufficiently high to influence the gas molecules
and initiate the electrical breakdown of the gas. By far, non-resonant
breakdown has been the most frequently adopted ignition mode to

intake manifold was seeded by ozone produced by a dielectric
barrier discharge reactor. Experimental results showed that low
ozone concentrations (<50 ppm) have an important impact on the
phasing of the cool and main flame in the engine. It was found that
the low temperature ignition and main flame ignition timing
decreased significantly when ozone concentration increased from
0 to 20 ppm. However, it was also reported that the influence of O3
became less important above 20 ppm although the ignition time
monotonically decreased. If the O3 concentration increased from
0 to 54 ppm at the intake of the HCCI engine, it advanced the main
flame phasing by 7 CAD (Crank Angle Degree). Comparatively, a
variation of 0e60% of EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) retards the
phasing of the main flame by 7 CAD. A variation of 60 K of the intake
gases mixture temperature affected 3 CAD and a variation of
49 ppm of NO had an effect of 1.5 CAD in this engine at the same
condition. Although numerical modeling identified that the effect
of O3 was majorly through the decomposition of O3 to release an O
atom, the detailed kinetic process was not well understood.

In summary, many engine experiments have shown that non-
equilibrium plasma can enhance engine performance. However,
due to the combined plasma effect on ignition and flame speed
through both thermal and non-thermal effects, some observed large-
enhancement in the lean burn limit was not appropriately explained.
Therefore, there is clear need to understand how plasma affects
ignition, flame propagation, and flammability limit from the point of
view of ignition and flame dynamics as well as combustion and
plasma chemistry. Moreover, since most of the practical engines
work at high pressure, there is a great need to understand the kinetic
properties of plasma and to develop a large volume plasma discharge
at high pressure to enhance combustion at engine conditions.

2.3. Plasma assisted combustion for pulse detonation engines

Since plasma can enhance ignition, non-equilibrium plasma
has also been tested to accelerate deflagration to detonation
transition in pulse detonation engines (PDE) [203]. Cathey et al.
[178] summarized the collaborative work between USC and Naval
Postgraduate School (NPS), Stanford University, and AFRL at
WrightePatterson AFB on TPI to accelerate ignition in pulse
detonation engines. It was demonstrated that at high flow rates
where spark-initiated flames were normally extinguished, the
transient plasma was able to ignite and effectively create a deto-
nation wave in the PDE experiment at NPS. Significant reduction
(factor of 4) in ignition delay time was also shown for C2H4/air
mixtures as in Fig. 2.22 together with a direct photograph of the

initiate combustion primarily because of its freedom in selecting the
laser wavelength and power. The advantage of laser ignition is that it
provides remote and multipoint ignition and avoids heat loss to the
electrode. Fig. 2.21 shows a compact prototype laser igniter which is
a passively Q-switched Nd:YAG/Cr4þ
:YAG giant pulse emitting
micro-laser with three beam output. Pavel et al. [200] reported that
at a 5 Hz repetition rate, each line delivered laser pulses with
approximately 2.4 mJ energy and 2.8 MW peak power within the
pulse duration. Recently, Princeton Optronics developed Vertical
Cavity Surface Emitting Laser (VCSEL) and increased the efficiency
(up to 63.4%) and energy output to 7 mJ per pulse with a repetition
rate of 20 Hz at pulse duration of 100 ms [201]. Although many en-
gine tests have demonstrated the ability of laser ignition to ignite
ultra-lean fuel-air mixtures and mixtures with high EGR, the laser
stability at a high temperature (e.g., 200e400 (cid:3)C), vibration, and
soot formation are still challenging problems [201].

Ozone (O3), which can be efficiently produced by plasma and
can have a strong low temperature kinetic enhancement effect
[108] and can modify flame speed [157,202], has also been used for
engine combustion control. The effect of O3 on the combustion of n-
heptane (nC7H16) in a HCCI engine was studied by Foucher et al.
[179]. Experiments were performed in a single cylinder diesel en-
gine fueled with n-heptane at constant equivalence ratio of 0.3,
intake temperature of 300 K, and engine speed of 1500 rpm. The

PDE setup. Tests were conducted at ARFL with H2/air and aviation
gasoline/air mixture. A reduction in the ignition delay by factor of
2 was obtained for both H2/air and aviation gasoline/air mixture.
The transient plasma was able to reliably ignite aviation gasoline/
air mixture at equivalence ratios of nearly 0.65, whereas the
baseline's lower limit was 0.71. The transient plasma ignition of
C2H4/O2 mixture resulted in ignition delay reduction by nearly one
order of magnitude (factor 9) in the PDE setup at Stanford
University.

Recently, Lefkowitz et al. [62] studied the effect of high-
frequency nanosecond pulsed discharges on PDEs as shown in
Fig. 2.23(a). By comparing the ignition delay times as well as high-
speed imaging of the ignition kernel growth with different igniters
(igniter powered by nanosecond pulsed power and conventional
multi-spark igniter), they found a significant decrease in the igni-
tion time in the PDE for a variety of fuels and equivalence ratios (F).
As demonstrated in Fig. 2.23(b), with the same amount of total
energy input, higher frequency discharges can initiate flame
propagation. Fig. 2.23(c) showed the difference between the
nanosecond pulsed plasma igniter and the multiple spark discharge
(MSD) igniter. With roughly the same amount of total energy
consumption, the MSD ignition kernel eventually extinguishes,
while the plasma ignited kernel goes on to become a self-
propagating flame. In addition, both the leaner and the richer
ignition could be achieved with the help of the nanosecond pulsed
igniter. One possible reason of the decrease in the ignition delay is
the increase in energy deposition from the nanosecond pulsed
the plasmaechemical
power supply. But
interaction in the
discharge is still not clear.

2.4. Plasma assisted combustion for flame stabilization in gas
turbine engines

Lean blowout limit, flame stabilization and instability are the
key issues of gas turbine engines. Plasma is also used as a new
technology to increase the flame stability and achieve ultra-lean
combustion. Serbin et al.
[204] claimed that a gas turbine
combustor with piloted flame stabilization by non-equilibrium
plasma can provide better performance, wider turndown ratios,
and lower emissions of carbon and nitrogen oxides. However, de-
tails were not discussed in the paper.

Moeck et al. [163] studied the effect of nanosecond pulsed
discharge on combustion instabilities at 1 atm. The nanosecond
pulsed discharges were generated by a solid state pulse generator
(FID 300-100MC4K) with 10 ns pulse width at 10e80 kHz pulse

repetition frequency (f) and 12 kV amplitude. The discharge was
coupled at the nozzle exit of a swirl-stabilized combustor as shown
in Fig. 2.24. A central pin electrode was installed at the swirler
outlet to the combustion chamber that served as the cathode. With
this electrode arrangement, nanosecond pulsed discharge fila-
ments were generated between the central pin electrode and the
loop-electrode in a disk-shaped area. The effect of the discharges on
the mean flame illustrated on the basis of averaged CH* chem-
iluminescence images is shown in Fig. 2.25. The images were taken
at an equivalence ratio F 1⁄4 0.62 and a thermal power of 50 kW. The
Reynolds number based on the bulk velocity in the burner passage,
the diameter thereof, and the viscosity in the unburned gases was
37,000. The mean flame shape without plasma discharges was
compared to the case with discharges at pulse repetition fre-
quencies between 5 and 25 kHz, which corresponded to an elec-
trical power of between 30 and 150 W. Without plasma, the flame
was lifted off and stabilized in the shear layers associated with the
recirculation zone (Fig. 2.25(a)). As the discharges were activated
and the pulse repetition frequency was increased, the flame moved
successively further upstream and eventually stabilized in the
burner passage (Fig. 2.25(b)e(d)).

The effect of steady pulsed discharges on combustion dynamics
was further investigated. It was found that the discharges had a
strong effect on the pressure pulsations associated with thermoa-
coustic dynamics. With the consumption of less than one percent of

the total power of the flame, the nanosecond discharge can
significantly reduce the oscillation amplitude of the acoustic pres-
sure. However, at some conditions, plasma forcing can also desta-
bilize a nominally stable combustion system. Since the discharges
affect both the flame shape and the position, they have an influence
on the dynamic response of the flame to acoustic perturbations. It
may have a stabilizing effect in nominally unstable conditions, but
the opposite is also possible. In order to use plasma as an actuator
to control the flame dynamics, much more work needs to be done

to reveal the fundamental mechanisms of
interaction.

the plasma/flame

Recently, Lacoste et al. [176] redesigned the experimental rig
and studied the effects of nanosecond pulsed discharges on the
dynamics of a swirl-stabilized lean premixed CH4/air flame at 1 atm
with thermal power 4 kW (Fig. 2.26, left). The discharge pulses
were 8 kV in amplitude and 10 ns in duration at f 1⁄4 30 kHz, which is
equivalent to 40 W electric power. The swirl number was 0.53. The
flame image in Fig. 2.26 (right) was
reconstructed for

reducing the velocity fluctuation amplitude by an order of magni-
tude. The authors explained that this phenomenon was mainly
caused by the thermal effect of the plasma. The ultra-fast heating of
the flow by plasma was followed by expansion of gas and genera-
tion of shock waves. This aerodynamical impact on transport affects
flow velocity and alters vortex structure, and therefore changes the
flame transfer function.

Barbosa et al. [177] further studied the effects of a nanosecond
pulsed discharge plasma on the flame stability domain of a lean
C3H8/air premixed of a swirling burner. A two-stage swirled
injector was connected to a rectangular combustion chamber with
optical access ports. Both stages were supplied with C3H8 and air.
Both the swirlers were oriented in the same direction to ensure a
strong co-rotating swirling motion. The primary and the secondary
stage C3H8/air mixtures mixed together upon entering the com-
bustion chamber. The peak power of the combustor was 52 kW
with exit velocity 40 m/s. The combustion chamber had a square
cross-section of 100 (cid:4) 100 mm2 and a length of 500 mm. The
sidewalls of the chamber were made of two silica windows to
enable optical diagnostics in the flame, and the top and the bottom
walls of the chamber were made of concrete. All studies were
performed at ambient pressure and ambient temperature. A direct
photograph of the experimental setup and flame stabilization is
shown in Fig. 2.27. The discharge was produced using a pulse
generator (FID FPG 30-100MS) with 10 ns pulse width. The voltage
amplitude was 30 kV at a repetitive frequency f 1⁄4 30 kHz which
corresponded to approximately 350 W power.

The operating regimes of the burner were determined as a
function of the global equivalence ratio, Fg using CH* chem-
iluminescence. Fig. 2.28 shows the evolution of the flames when
the fuel flow rate injected through the primary stage was
decreased. It is clearly showing that without plasma, the flame
extinction was observed when the equivalence ratios reached
Fg 1⁄4 0.41, whereas using plasma the flame stabilization limits were
reduced to Fg 1⁄4 0.11. Thus, the plasma discharge significantly
extended the global flame stabilization limit. By using a small
fraction (~1%) of the flame power, extended stability domain of a
laboratory scale gas turbine combustor was demonstrated. This
experiment also raised the question whether the observed
increased flame stabilization was due to the thermal effect or the
kinetic effect and whether the kinetic effect can extend local
flammability limit instead of the global equivalence ratio. Further
fundamental studies with local flame structure diagnostics are
needed.

The ionic wind effect caused by a DC electric field was also used
to increase the stabilization of the lean propane flames [65]. The
results showed that by using a low DC electric field opposing the
gas flow direction, not only the flame structure but also the flame
stabilization was significantly modified as shown in Fig. 2.29. The
results showed that dissociative recombination of major positive

demonstration purposes by combining a photo of the flame with
plasma contribution with a short exposure time and a photo of the
flame without plasma but with a much longer exposure time. The
velocity and CH* chemiluminescence signals were used to deter-
mine the flame transfer function. The flame response to acoustic
perturbations of the incoming flow was investigated in a range of
frequencies from 16 to 512 Hz at equivalence ratio F 1⁄4 0.7. It was
found that in almost the entire range of excitation frequencies, the
discharge affected the gain of the flame transfer function. The phase
was also affected by the discharges, but only at high frequencies. In
addition, the study showed the flame instability could be effectively
mitigated by the application of nanosecond pulsed discharges,

icals modifying both the combustion kinetics. However, it was not
clear why such a low concentration of radicals (below 10 ppb) could
have such a big impact on the flame structure and stability. The
effect of ion transport induced flow motion and acceleration might
produce a more significant effect. Therefore, not only the thermal
and kinetic effects but also the transport effect by plasma plays a
significant role in modifying combustion. It requires well-defined
experiment platforms to isolate these effects so that the funda-
mental mechanism can be understood.

Recently, Versailles et al. [205] integrated a DBD actuator into
the premixer of a combustor to investigate the effect of ionic wind
on flashback. Flashback makes combustor design very challenging
with the change of fuel properties. A flame flashback will happen
when the turbulent flame speed of a high energy fuel is faster than
the flow velocity. Due to the wall shear stress, the flow velocity near
the wall is very low and the propensity for flashback to occur in the
boundary layer is very high. In the study by Versailles et al. [205], a
DBD actuator was applied on the wall of the premixer as shown in
Fig. 2.30 to create the ionic wind to increase the flow velocity in the
boundary layer to prevent flashback. The flow acceleration also
helps in strengthening the outer recirculation zone in the
combustor to help anchor the flame at the dump plane. As shown in
Fig. 2.31, without DBD actuation, the flame stabilized on the rim of
the premixer (Fig. 2.31(a)), while with DBD actuation the flame
recirculation zone
anchoring was provided by the outer
(Fig. 2.31(a)). It was reported that with the DBD actuation, the
combustor stable operation regime can be stretched as much as
4.6% by shifting the flashback limit to higher equivalence ratios.

In summary, the above experiments have shown that non-
equilibrium plasma can enhance flame stabilization and extend the
lean burn and flashback limit significantly. However, it is not clear
through what kinetic pathways and flame dynamics the flame speed
is increased and the flammability is extended because many mech-
anisms such as the multi-dimensional discharge effect, temperature
increase, radical production, fuel reforming, and the ionic wind effect
all present at the same time. It is important to understand the re-
action pathways of kinetic enhancement and combustion dynamics
of plasma assisted combustion based on the fundamental flame
theory and using well-defined flame experiments.

2.5. Emission control and fuel reforming by plasma

Plasma has been widely studied for reduction of soot and NOx
emissions as well as fuel reforming [82e108]. Since the focus of this
review is on plasma assisted combustion, the applications of
plasma on soot/NOx/hydrocarbon emissions and fuel reforming are
only reviewed briefly here.

with (top) and without (bottom) DBD actuation [205].

Fig. 2.31. Direct photographs of CH4/air flames (a) without and (b) with DBD actuation
[205].

For soot emission control, Cha et al. [96] studied a dielectric
barrier discharge (DBD) in coflow jet C3H8 diffusion flames. The
plasma reactor had wire-cylinder type electrodes with AC power
supply operated at 400 Hz. The stainless steel wire acted as a
central electrode with 1 mm diameter. The cylindrical electrode
made from a woven stainless mesh (1 (cid:4) 1 mm) having a width of
10 mm surrounded the outer quartz tube. The effect of the ampli-
tude of applied voltage on flames was studied. It was observed that
with the increase of applied voltage, flame length decreased
(Fig. 2.32). At the same time, the yellow luminosity indicating soot
formation decreased with the decrease in the flame height.
Without plasma breakdown, significant soot reduction was re-
ported as demonstrated with low power consumption in the order
of 1 W. Further thermocouple and FTIR measurements showed that
the change in flame temperature and species concentrations for
C3H8, CO2 and H2O was negligible. Radical production, such as O, O3,
OH and H was used to explain the soot reduction phenomenon. The
reduction of soot was likely caused by the transport effect of ionic
wind on fuel/oxidizer mixing.

As an after-treatment technology for engines, non-equilibrium
plasma has also been extensively studied for soot reduction. The
challenge for conventional soot reduction methods, such as cata-
lytic coating of the filter, additives or soot oxidation by NO2 is that
they start working at a minimum temperature of 250 (cid:3)C, while the
typical exhaust temperatures of engines are in a wider range be-
tween 120 and 650 (cid:3)C [206,207]. Plasma is one of the promising
after-treatment technologies in this temperature range. Grund-
mann et al. [206] studied soot treatment by using DBD and ozone.
In their study, soot was externally accumulated in the engine
exhaust gas pipe of a small emergency generator (Yanmar, 0.4 L, 1
cylinder). The comparison showed that the plasma oxidized soot
significantly faster than O3. It was possibly due to the radical pro-
duction by plasma while O3 decomposed at lower temperature
(200 (cid:3)C).

Song et al. [188] characterized the abatement of particulate
matter (PM), hydrocarbons (HC), and NOx from an actual diesel
exhaust using DBD technology. A DBD reactor excited by a high
frequency AC power supply (sine wave, peak voltage 0e14 kV,
frequency: 10e27 kHz) was used to treat the exhaust gases. The
abatement capability of PM, HC and NOx as functions of voltage at
fixed frequency are shown in Fig. 2.33. No breakdown occurred
when the applied voltage was lower than 6 kV and the removal
efficiency of contaminants was very limited. When the increase in
the applied voltage had exceeded 6 kV, the abatements of PM and
HC increased obviously and saturated at approximately 80%. The
trend of NOx removal efficiency was different from those of PM and
HC. In the range of 4e7.5 kV in the peak voltage, a significant in-
crease of NOx removal efficiency from 0.5% to 67.3% was observed.

However, a further increase in the peak voltage lowered the
removal efficiency. A possible reason was the dissociation of N2 to
form NOx owing to the increase in E/N. The authors also reported
the abatements of various alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydro-
carbons (PAHs) including alkanes, alkenes, and aromatics. However,
the underlying abatement mechanisms are still missing.

NOx and hydrocarbon reduction by gliding arc has also been
extensively conducted [82,83,91,99,189]. Lee et al. [189] investi-
gated NOx reduction in industrial burners using gliding arc. A first
stage combustor integrated with gliding arc plasma was embedded
with the head of the commercial reference burner. The schematic of
the burner is shown in Fig. 2.34. The gliding arc was convected

downward with the fluid-dynamic rotation of reactant flow. Liquid
nature gas (LNG) was supplied through the bottom hole of the
reactor, where it was rapidly mixed with air and allowed to enter
into the arc region. The plasma used AC power with a frequency of
10 kHz corresponding to powers 50e150 W which were a value less
than 0.1% of the fuel heating value. The comparison of NOx pro-
duction rate in the reference and modified burners is shown in
Fig. 2.35 as a function of the excess air ratio. The direct photographs
of the flame from the two burners were also embedded. Significant
NOx reduction was observed. The first stage combustor operated as
a reformer that could host a partial oxidation process, producing
hydrogen rich (10% in volume) syngas flow that ignited and stabi-
lized the combustion flame apart from the burner rim. Ultimately,
the enhanced mixing and removal of hot flame zone with a
broadened flame area acted as the main mechanisms of NOx
reduction.

Plasma has been widely used in fuel reforming, in addition to
emission reduction [98e106]. Recently, two different types of fuel
reformers, the nanosecond spark discharge and the nanosecond
DBD have been developed for propane-air reforming. For the
nanosecond spark discharge, 70% fuel conversion was obtained
[208]. For the pulsed nanosecond DBD reformer, the effect of
temperature on reforming between 900 and 1300 K was studied. A
significant influence on mixture conversion efficiency, especially at
T 1⁄4 900 K, was obtained (Fig. 2.36). It was found that the energy
cost of hydrogen for DBD reformer is higher compared to that for
nanosecond spark reformer.

In this section, firstly, we will present an overview of the basic
chemistry and dynamics of ignition, flame initiation, propagation
speed, and extinction limit as well as their dependence on tem-
perature, chemistry, and transport. By using the physical and
chemical properties of plasma, we will discuss the mechanisms and
kinetic pathways in which plasma can enhance ignition, flame
propagation, and extinction and lean burn limits.

3.1. Dynamics and chemistry of plasma assisted ignition

Ignition is an exothermic, chain-branching reaction process
which results in an exponential increase in heat release and fuel
oxidation. Therefore, ignition requires two key processes: one is
that the temperature needs to reach a threshold of an exothermic
chain-branching process and the other is that the radical produc-
tion chain-branching process is faster than the chain-termination
process. As shown in Fig. 1.4, as the heat release of a reaction sys-
tem increases (or decreases), the temperature of the reaction sys-
tem increases. At a critical temperature of the chain-branching
limit, ignition occurs and both the concentration of radicals and the
temperature of the reaction system increase exponentially. In a
diffusion controlled system, once ignition occurs, a flame with
higher temperature will be formed. If the fuel concentration de-
creases or the heat loss of the reaction system increases in a flame,
the flame temperature decreases. As the flame temperature de-
creases to a critical temperature, the chain-termination process
becomes faster than the chain-branching process and the flame
extinguishes. This is the so-called ignition to extinction S-curve
(Fig. 1.4) [141e143].

For a given mixture with given initial temperature and pressure,
ignition occurs with a time delay. Fig. 3.1 shows an example of a
lean n-heptane ignition process at 20 atm and different tempera-
tures. It is seen that for an initial temperature of 1000 K, it takes
about 5 ms for ignition (exponential increase in temperature) to
occur. This delay time (tig) is called the ignition delay time. The
ignition delay time is not only affected by temperature and

function of the excess air ratio [189].

conflicting results. Some experiments reported that plasma
enhanced both the ignition and the lean burn limit. Others showed
that plasma had little impact on flame propagation speeds. Some
experiments showed that the plasma enhancement was due to
thermal effect, while others demonstrated enhancement effects via
kinetics and transport (e.g., ionic wind). The experimental results of
Wolk et al. [70] clearly showed that the use of microwave had a
greater enhancement effect in oxygen rich conditions than that in
fuel rich condition and that plasma enhanced ignition kernel
development but not for flame speeds. Moreover, the results
showed that the enhancement decreased with an increase in
pressure. How do we explain these observations from flame dy-
namics, chemistry, and transport?

pressure, but also significantly by the fuel chemistry and the initial
level of radicals.

Since hydrogen is the simplest combustion system, we first use
hydrogen as an example to understand how the chain-initiation,
branching, and termination processes govern the ignition time
and explosion limit at different pressure and temperature ranges
and to explain how radical production can enhance ignition. Table 3
shows the important chain-initiation, branching, propagation, and
termination reactions as well as important plasma generated
radical production and NOx catalytic reactions of H2/O2 system.
Without plasma, the radicals (e.g., H and HO2) are initially produced
by a slow reaction (R1). After that, one H radical will generate two
radicals (OH and O) via the branching reaction (R2). Note that the
reaction (R2) has a high activation energy and requires a high
temperature (~1100 K at 1 atm) to accelerate. Therefore, the pro-
duced OH and O radicals quickly generate three H radicals via the
chain-propagation reactions (R3) and (R4) (Fig. 3.2, left), leading to
an exponential
increase in radical concentration for ignition.
Therefore, at high temperature, one H radical produces three H
radicals via (R1)e(R4) and the ignition delay time is largely
controlled by two slower reactions: (R1) and (R2). As such, a small

radical production by plasma significantly shortens the ignition
delay time by bypassing the chain initiation reaction (R1).

Fig. 3.2 (right) shows that radical addition into stoichiometric
H2/O2 mixture at 1000 K reduces ignition delay time. It is seen that
only 10 ppm radical addition of H by plasma shortens ignition time
by a factor of five because radical addition by plasma bypasses the
slowest chain-initiation reaction (R1) and provides the initial rad-
icals directly for branching reaction (R2). In addition, it is inter-
esting to note that atomic O radical addition is more effective than
H and OH in a H2/O2 system. As seen in Fig. 3.2 (left), this is because
adding one OH radical immediately produces one H radical via
reaction (R4) since the reaction rate of chain-propagation reaction
(R4) is much faster than that of (R2). So OH and H additions are
equivalent. However, for one atomic O radical addition, as the re-
action (R3) is also faster than (R2), 2H radicals are immediately
produced from reactions (R3) and (R4). This is why adding atomic O
in a H2/O2 system is more effective than adding H and OH for
ignition enhancement. Fortunately, non-equilibrium plasma is an
effective tool to produce atomic O via electron and excited nitrogen
impact dissociation reactions (e.g., (R8a)e(R8c)) [43,148,161].

At lower temperature and high pressure, radical production via
branching reaction (R2) is suppressed quickly by the termination
reaction (R7) and the reverse reaction of (R1), leading to the
occurrence of the second explosion limit [209,210] and a negative
burning rate dependence [211] on pressure due to the competition
between (R2) and (R7);

(3.1)

where k is the reaction rate constant and M is the third-body
concentration. If pressure further increases, the HO2 concentra-
tion formed by (R7) becomes so high that the reactions (R5) and
(R6) become the main branching reaction pathways to produce
OH radicals from HO2 and H2O2. These three different chain-
branching pathways at low, intermediate and high pressures lead
to the three different explosion limits of the H2/O2 system
[141e143]. Fig. 3.3 shows that the three different H2/O2 explosion
limits [212] (red dots (in the web version)) and the successful
ignition conditions by plasma [213]. It is seen that without plasma,
as discussed above, there are three pressure-dependent explosion
limits, low pressure limit, the second explosion limit, and the high
pressure limit, controlled by reaction (R2), the competition be-
tween reactions (R2) and (R7), and the HO2 and H2O2 branching via
(R5) and (R6). It is interesting to note that with a plasma discharge,
ignition can occur at a temperature below that of the explosion
limit. This is because the radical production by plasma via reactions

reaction rate. Right: Ignition delay time decreases with the additions of different initial radicals (H, OH, O) in stoichiometric H2/O2 system at 1000 K and 1 atm.

OH radical but (R20) produces two OH (branching), the branching
ratio of (R18) and (R19) affects the low temperature reactivity
significantly. Moreover, the unimolecular decomposition reactions
of (R16)e(R20) are all pressure dependent. Therefore, the low
temperature ignition has strong pressure dependence.

After low temperature ignition, at an intermediate temperature
(800e950 K as seen in Fig. 3.1), the chain branching process via (R6)
accelerates in the products of
low temperature ignition (via
(R15)e(R20)) and leads to the transition to high temperature
ignition (HTI). This process is dominated by the temperature
dependent reaction (R6), and thus is very sensitive to the concen-
trations of HO2 and active radicals (X) as well as the heat release
rate. Any external radicals and heat addition will accelerate the
transition to high temperature ignition via the key reactions at
intermediate temperature ((R21)e(R24), and (R6)),

such as (R8) and (R9) in Table 3 breakdown the balance of the
chain-branching and termination reactions and thus enhance the
chain-branching process.

Moreover, in addition to the radicals at ground states, excited
intermediate species and long lifetime species such as O2(1Dg),
O(1D) (electronically excited atomic O), O3 and NO are also pro-
duced by plasma, which add new reaction pathways to produce
radicals via reactions (R10)e(R14) at much lower temperature than
that in (R2). For example, at room temperature, the reaction rate
constant of (R10) is about 100 times larger than that of (R2).
Therefore, these plasma generated new reaction pathways lead to
plasma assisted kinetic enhancement of ignition, especially at low
temperature. In addition, if plasma produces NO and NO2, the low
temperature NOx catalytic reactions ((R13) and (R14)) can convert
inactive radicals such as HO2 to two OH radicals and thus promote
chain-branching reactions and extend ignition limit [138,139]. De-
tails of plasma kinetic enhancement of ignition will be discussed in
Section 4.

For large molecule hydrocarbon fuels, the ignition and ignition
chemistry become more complicated than for hydrogen. As seen in
Fig. 3.1, for n-heptane at 20 atm and initial temperatures of 850 K
and 700 K, there are two ignition delay times, a low temperature
ignition (tig,LTI) and a high temperature ignition (tig,HTI). The low
temperature chain-branching for radical production (OH) and
ignition is mainly caused by the reactions such as [7,24,214,215],

Note that at a low temperature condition, the H abstraction
reaction (R15) is very slow because of the extremely low concen-
tration of radicals (X) (e.g., less than 100 ppb). Therefore, (R15) is a
limiting step to produce initial hydrocarbon radicals (R). Reactions
(R17) and (R19) are the other two limiting reactions to form QOOH
and O2QOOH for radical production. Since (R18) only produces one

Due to the distinctive fuel oxidation pathways in low, interme-
diate, and high temperatures, a typical ignition delay time depen-
dence of a stoichiometric n-heptane/air mixture on temperature
and pressure of n-heptane is shown in Fig. 3.4 [216]. It is seen that
at the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) region, where the
ignition delay time decreases first and then increase with the in-
crease in temperature, the ignition time at low temperature can be
much shorter than that of high temperature ignition. In addition,
the increase in pressure reduces the ignition delay time.

R8-R14, the following direct impact dissociation by electron,

also produce additional small and large hydrocarbon radicals to
further accelerate reactions of (R15) to (R20), and (R21)e(R23) at
low and intermediate temperature ranges.

Note that the plasma reaction pathways are strongly electron
temperature or reduced electric field (E/N) dependent. Fig. 3.5
shows an example of the variation of rate constant and reaction
flux as a function of the reduced electric field for reaction (R8a) in
comparison with the rate constants and reaction fluxes of impor-
tant chain-branching and propagation reactions ((R1)e(R3) and
(R6)). It can be seen that the rate constant of the electron impact
reaction is much larger than that of the important radical chain-
branching and initiation reactions as shown in Fig. 3.5(a). Howev-
er, the combustion process is determined by the reaction flux of
different reactions [218], not the rate constant. The reaction fluxes
of the same reactions are shown in Fig. 3.5(b). In the calculation of
reaction flux, the pressure is assumed to be 1 atm. The electron

O2 concentration is 19%, H2 concentration is 0.5%, and H2O2 con-
centration is 500 ppm. During the calculation, regardless of the
increase of temperature, the number density of e, atomic O and H
are held constant. It can be seen from Fig. 3.5(b) that at low tem-
perature conditions (T < 1000 K), the electron impact reaction (R8a)
is much faster than (R2) and (R6) to produce radicals. Especially, a
larger difference in fluxes in (R8a) and (R6) than that of in (R8a) and
(R2) suggests that the plasma assisted combustion will have more
impact in the intermediate and low temperature branching process
than that in the high temperature branching process. Note that
when temperature is higher than 1000 K, the conventional chain
branching reaction (R2) starts to dominate the radical production
process. Therefore, the plasma effect at temperature above 1000 K
is more thermal or bypassing the chain-initiation reaction (R1) than
kinetic enhancement.

As discussed above, plasma can kinetically shorten the ignition
delay time at low, intermediate, and high temperature, in different

ways. At low temperature, a plasma discharge will produce new
pathways (R8)e(R14) to form active radials to accelerate reaction
(R15) for the radical branching reaction of (R20). At intermediate
temperature, the production of radicals and heat will dramatically
enhance the transition from low temperature ignition to high
temperature ignition via reaction (R6). As seen in Fig. 3.5(b), at
the plasma assisted combustion
temperature above 1100 K,
enhancement becomes more like thermal effect. Moreover, Fig. 3.5
suggests that the plasma kinetic enhancement effect is much
greater at low temperature than that at higher temperature.

To summarize the kinetic effect of plasma discharge on low,
intermediate, and high temperature ignition for large hydrocar-
bons, Fig. 3.6 shows schematically the major reaction pathways of
plasma assisted ignition and combustion at different temperature
ranges. It is important to bear in mind that (at high temperature)
when the temperature is above the critical temperature of the
branching reactions ((R2) and Eq. (3.1)), the major role of plasma is
thermal enhancement because the branching rate of (R2) is very
high. The kinetic effect of plasma chemistry on ignition is much
greater at low and intermediate temperatures to promote branch-
ing reactions (R6) and (R20). In fact, in recent experiments of
plasma assisted combustion by using nanosecond discharge and
ozone addition, plasma activated low temperature ignition and cool
flames [107,108] were observed even at 1 atm at 550 K with flow
residence time less than 10 ms, which is impossible without plasma
discharge.

3.2. Dynamics, chemistry, and transport of plasma assisted flame
propagation

A flame is an exothermic self-propagating, thermal diffusion
driven auto-ignition front. The burning velocity of a premixed
flame is a function of fuel oxidation chemistry, transport properties,
adiabatic flame temperature, and heat and mass losses. On one
hand, a radical or heat loss from the flame decreases the flame
speed or can even quench the flame. On the other hand, if external
energy and/or radicals are added by plasma to the flame, the flame
speed increases and its propagation limit broadens. In order to
understand how the plasma produced thermal, kinetic, and trans-
port effects affect flame speed and the lean burn limit, it is neces-
sary to understand how flame speed and lean burn limit depend on
these processes.

The lean burn limit or flammability limit is defined as the lowest
equivalence ratio at which a one-dimensional, stretch free planar
flame can propagate. The theoretical and experimental determi-
nation of the limits have been conducted for several decades
[141e143,219,220]. It has been concluded that the radiation heat
loss from the flame is the cause of the flammability limit [221e223].
The flame speed with radiation heat loss normalized by the adia-
batic flame speed as a function of heat loss (H) normalized by the
total chemical heat release rate of the fuel mixture (proportional to
fuel concentration) is given as [224],

U2 ln U2 1⁄4 (cid:2)bH

(3.2)

where b is the activation energy (Ea) normalized by the ratio of the
temperature difference between the adiabatic flame temperature
(Tad) and the unburned gas temperature (Tu) to the product of
universal gas constant R0 and the square of Tad,

b 1⁄4 EaðTad

As shown in Fig. 3.7, with the increase in normalized heat loss
(H) (or the decrease in fuel concentration), the flame speed de-
(cid:2)1, the normalized flame speed reaches a critical
creases. At bH 1⁄4 e
(cid:2)1/2), beyond which a leaner mixture (larger H) is not
value (e
flammable (no flame speed exists). This critical limit (fuel lean
concentration) is the so-called flammability limit. From the defi-
nition of bH in Eqs. (3.2) and (3.3), for a given heat loss rate, both the
activation energy and the heat release from the fuel affect the
flammability limit. Note that a flame heat release rate is governed
by high temperature chain-branching process such as reaction R2,
which is exponentially dependent on temperature. The global
activation energy in Eq. (3.3) is largely determined by the activation
energy of reaction (R2). Therefore, for flame propagation speed and

flammability limit, the thermal effect of plasma is greater than the
non-equilibrium kinetic effect. This is why as shown in Figs. 2.15
and 2.16, at the same temperature non-equilibrium plasma can
barely change the flame propagating speed and the lean burn limit
kinetically. This means that we should not expect the plasma ki-
netic effect alone without the increase of temperature to signifi-
cantly enhance flame speed and flammability limit of a high
temperature flame because the radical production rate by plasma at
flame temperature is slower than that by the chain-branching re-
action (R2) at the same temperature (Fig. 3.5(b)).

Nevertheless, flame propagation speed and flammability limit
can be changed significantly by the transport process which mod-
ifies the peak flame temperature and the reaction rate of (R2). For
example, a methane/air mixture has a flammability limit near
F 1⁄4 0.5. However, the microgravity experiments and computations
[223,225] showed that the flammability limit of methane is much
lower than F 1⁄4 0.5 if there is a flow velocity gradient (the stretch
rate). Fig. 3.8 shows the computed G-curve [223] indicating the
extinction limits and flammability limit of premixed counterflow
methane/air flames. It is seen that without flow stretch (velocity
gradient), the flammability limit of methane is F 1⁄4 0.50 (point E).
(cid:2)1, the lean flammability
However, with a stretch rate around 10 s
limit becomes F 1⁄4 0.42, which is much lower than the flammability
limit of flame without a velocity gradient. This extension is caused
by the thermal effect of preferential diffusion or the Lewis number
effect, that is, a lighter fuel molecule such as methane can diffuse
faster into the reaction zone than the heat lost by the thermal
diffusion from the flame. In this case, if the total stretch rate of the
flame (flow velocity gradient) is not large, the normalized flame
speed of Eq. (3.2) can be given as [226],

U2 ln U2 1⁄4 (cid:2)bH (cid:2) b

Le (cid:2) 1

Ka

(cid:1)

(cid:3)

(3.4)

where Le is the Lewis number and Ka is the Karlovitz number (the
flame stretch rate normalized by the thermal diffusion timescale).
Therefore, if Le is less than unity and the stretch rate is positive, Eq.
(3.4) shows that the flame speed will increase with flame stretch
until there is not enough time for combustion to occur. This is why
the flammability limit shown in Fig. 3.8 is extended for methane/air
mixture if there is a flow stretch (Ka > 0). For hydrogen whose Lewis
number is even smaller, the extension of flammability limit by flow

stretch is significant [227]. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 1.4, if plasma
can reduce the fuel Lewis number, it will be able to reduce the
flammability limit.

How does plasma discharge affect flame speed and the flam-
mability limit? The flame speed dependence on plasma effects
(parameters with superscript of *) can be given as following,

(cid:1)

(cid:3)

(3.5)

Firstly, plasma will reduce the global activation energy from b to
b* by creating radicals and new reaction pathways (e.g., reactions
(R8)e(R14) and (R24)e(R28)) at high temperature to increase the
flame speed. Note that this increase will only be modest because
the plasma radical production rate at flame temperature is much
slower than that of (R2). Secondly, plasma discharge like micro-
wave can deposit additional heat (Q*) to the flame and accelerate
the flame speed. This thermal effect is very important because the
chain branching rate of (R2) is strongly temperature dependent.
Thirdly, plasma can lower the effective fuel Lewis number from Le
to Le* in Eq. (3.5) by dissociating or reforming the large fuel mol-
ecules to lighter ones such as H2, CH4, CH2O, and C2H4 so that the
flame speed increases. This effect is also large because it increases
the flame temperature directly via the transport effect. Finally,
plasma will also be able to change the local flow field of the flame
and modify the flame stretch to Ka*. This effect can be twofold
depending on the effective Lewis number (Le*) and whether the
flow stretch is positive or negative. In addition, the plasma modi-
fied local flow field can increase the mixing between the burned
product and unburned mixture and thus enhance the flame speed
thermally (like heat recirculation). The above four effects can
explain most of the flame speed enhancement by plasma. However,
keep in mind that for flames the kinetic enhancement on flame
speed and flammability limit is much less effective than the ther-
mal effect and that on ignition.

To summarize the discussions of kinetic, thermal, and transport
enhancement effects by plasma on ignition and flame propagation,
Fig. 3.9 shows a schematic of plasma activated low temperature
ignition as well as flame regime transition for a liquid fuel with low
temperature chemistry. Without plasma, the conventional ignition
to extinction curve (I) shows three different combustion regimes:
the high temperature combustion (HTC), intermediate temperature
combustion (ITC), and low temperature combustion (LTC). The low
(tig,LTC),
temperature ignition limit
intermediate temperature
ignition limit (tig,ITC), and the extinction limit separate these three
different flame regimes. Note that due to the difference in the rates
of chain-branching reactions in LTC (R20), ITC (R6), and HTC (R2),

Fig. 3.9. Plasma activated low temperature ignition and flame regime transition from
the conventional S-curve (I: no plasma) with separated ignition and extinction limits to
a smooth ignition to flame transition curve without extinction limit (III: strong plasma
kinetic effect). HTC: high temperature combustion, ITC: intermediate temperature
combustion, LTC: low temperature combustion.

the kinetic enhancement effect of plasma discharge is different for
different combustion regimes in the order of:

Kinetic effect of LTC > Kinetic effect of ITC > Kinetic effect of HTC
(3.6)

As a result, with a non-equilibrium plasma discharge, the flame
curve II in Fig. 3.9 shows that the low temperature ignition, tig,LTC, is
enhanced much greater than that of the intermediate temperature
combustion (ITC) and leads to a new broadened plasma activated
LTC branch. Note that the timescale of t(cid:6)
ig;LTC with plasma activation
is much shorter than tig,LTC without plasma, allowing us to observe
plasma activated cool flames in our recent experiments [107,108]. If
plasma discharge increases its intensity further by producing more
radicals, the low temperature ignition time of t(cid:6)
ig;LTC on curve II
further decreases so that it is shorter than the characteristic time of
flame extinction. As a result, the classical S-curve with separated
ignition and extinction limits becomes a monotonic curve. This
monotonic dependence is the so called stretched S-curve without
an ignition limit. The transition from the classical ignition S-curve
to the monotonic transition curve without extinction limit has been
experimentally demonstrated by Sun et al. with nanosecond
plasma discharge [107,144]. As seen in Fig. 3.9, non-equilibrium
plasma has a much lesser enhancement effect on the flame
extinction limit and flame speed than that on the ignition limit. In
order to significantly enhance flame stabilization and lean burn
limit, a combination of thermal effect with kinetic effect is neces-
sary. The above conclusions and the experimental evidence are
important to design energy efficient plasma assisted combustion
engines.

3.3. Dynamics, chemistry, and transport of flame initiation and
minimum ignition energy and the role of plasma discharge

In Sections 3.2 and 3.3, we discussed the dynamics and chem-
istry of plasma assisted ignition and flame propagation, respec-
tively. In many unsteady combustion process such as the internal
combustion engines and PDE engines, a plasma initiated ignition
process involving unsteady transition from spark ignition to
propagating flame is required. In these processes, one of the main
questions is: 1) When will ignition be successful? 2) What is the
minimum ignition energy? and 3) How can we accelerate the
transition process? This process is neither an auto-ignition process
nor a flame propagation speed process. Rather it is an unsteady
flame initiation process. In order to understand how plasma can
enhance flame initiation, we need to understand what physical and
chemical processes govern a successful flame initiation.

The measurements of the minimum ignition energy by a spark
plug goes back to earlier work of Lewis and Von Elbe [219,228,229].
It was shown that the minimum ignition energy (MIE) increased at
both lean and rich sides and had the minimum near the stoichio-
metric condition. Moreover, the fuel molecule size and diluents also
affected the MIE. However, it was not until recently that the
mechanism of the MIE has been understood theoretically and
experimentally [116,196,230,231]. These studies have showed that
a successful flame initiation is governed by a critical flame initiation
radius, that is, only the spark which can drive the flame kernel to a
size greater than this critical flame initiation radius, can cause
successful ignition.

Fig. 3.10 shows the predicted trajectories of the normalized
flame speed U (normalized by the adiabatic planar flame speed) of a
spherical flame kernel propagating outwardly with different en-
ergy depositions (Q, the normalized ignition power given by

for a spark to drive the initial flame kernel to reach the critical flame
initiation radius (Rc). Note that here Rc is normalized by the flame
thickness, which is function of pressure. Therefore, the critical
flame initiation radius depends on pressure as,

Rc (cid:7) P(cid:2)n=2

(3.7)

Therefore, the higher the pressure, the smaller the dimensional
critical flame radius and the lower the minimum ignition energy.
Eq. (3.7) has a special implication to plasma assisted ignition, that
is, a good plasma igniter needs to create an ignition size larger
than Rc, to not deposit more energy. This result supports the
observation of ignition enhancement by microwave, gliding arc,
and corona discharge in internal combustion engines and PDE
engines because they all produce a larger ignition kernel than a
spark at the same energy deposition. In addition, when the fuel
mixture becomes leaner, the flame thickness increases due to the
decrease in flame speed. As shown in Fig. 3.10, the critical flame
radius for a leaner mixture increases and thus a larger minimum
ignition energy is required to create a larger ignition kernel size
than Rc.

Recently, the critical flame initiation radius was measured for
hydrogen and other hydrocarbon fuels [230,231]. Fig. 3.11 shows
the results of the flame propagation speed relative to the burned
gas as a function of time (flame radius) for a lean n-decane/air
mixture. It is seen that similar to the theoretical results in Fig. 3.10,
the flame kernel speed decreases first then reaches a minimum,
and finally increases back to the adiabatic flame speed as it prop-
agates outside. The measured critical flame radius at 1 atm is as
large as 1.4 cm for n-heptane. That means to ignite a lean n-heptane
mixture at 1 atm we need a plasma igniter which can generate a
flame kernel with radius as big as 1.4 cm. Fortunately, at fuel rich
conditions, the critical radius decreases significantly due to the
decrease in the mixture Lewis number for large hydrocarbon fuels.
In addition, the critical radius decreases with the increase in
pressure. These conclusions explain why the ignition enhancement
decreases both in fuel rich condition as in Fig. 2.15 and at higher
pressure as in Fig. 2.16.

Fig. 3.12 shows the dependence of the minimum ignition power
(Q) on Rc3 for different mixture Lewis numbers. It is seen that the

minimum ignition power is linear to Rc
appropriate measure of the minimum ignition energy. In addition,
it is seen that the minimum ignition energy depends monotonically
on the mixture Lewis number. The larger the Lewis number, the
larger the minimum ignition energy. This is why ignition is always

center of a quiescent mixture of a spherical chamber. It is seen that
if there is no energy deposition (Q 1⁄4 0), flame cannot exist at a
normalized radius (R, the normalized flame radius by the flame
thickness) below R 1⁄4 2.5 (point c) due to the stretch by flame
curvature. When a small normalized energy (Q 1⁄4 0.1) is added, a
flame kernel is initiated from the center and its flame speed de-
creases so quickly that the flame kernel extinguishes at location f
before it can reach the self-propagating flame branch starting at d.
As a result, the flame initiation fails. When the ignition energy is
increased to Q 1⁄4 0.15, it is seen that the inner flame kernel trajec-
tory (gh) and the outside propagating flame trajectory (hb) merges
at location h where the flame kernel flame is the minimum. As the
flame kernel propagates further outwardly, the flame speed in-
creases as the flame radius approaches to infinity. Therefore, a
successful ignition initiation is achieved. For any larger energy
deposition (e.g., Q 1⁄4 0.6), successful ignition is always achieved.
Therefore, the minimum ignition energy of this mixture is Q 1⁄4 0.15
and the critical flame initiation radius is R 1⁄4 Rc (radius at point h). In
other words, the minimum ignition energy is the energy required

more difficult in IC engines when the mixture is lean (large Le) but
is easier at fuel rich conditions (small Le). Fig. 3.12 also shows that
the activation energy (Z) affects the minimum ignition energy as
well, implying that plasma can change the chemistry and reduce
the MIE kinetically.

What is the implication of Figs. 3.10e3.12 to plasma assisted
ignition in engines? In summary, plasma can help engine ignition in
the following ways: 1) Non-equilibrium plasma can be used to
generate a larger discharge volume than the critical radius (Rc) to
enhance ignition. 2) Plasma can dissociate or reform the large fuel
molecules to smaller ones so that the mixture Lewis number be-
comes smaller and the critical radius is smaller; 3) Plasma can
reduce the activation energy of fuel oxidation to reduce the flame
thickness and the critical radius; and 4) plasma can increase the
temperature so that the flame thickness decreases, leading to a
smaller dimensional critical flame initiation radius. In fact, recent
theoretical studies by Chen and coworkers confirmed these con-
clusions [232].

3.4. Plasma assisted ignition by creating a large discharge volume

In order to create a large ignition kernel, different discharges
and their combinations have been used to enhance ignition and
ignition to flame propagation. Recently, Wang et al. have developed
a microwave ignition system in a constant volume cylinder cham-
ber with high speed imaging [71] (Fig. 3.13). The results showed
that compared to a spark igniter, pulsed microwave energy depo-
sition (50 mJ) in 2 ms is able to achieve successful ignition of

Fig. 3.14. (a) Schlieren images shows development of two parallel lines with the effect

methane/air mixtures in much leaner conditions between 1 and
10 atm. At the same time, the results also showed that when both a
spark plug (60 mJ) and pulsed microwave igniter are able to ignite
the mixture, the flame propagated speeds are similar. The results
confirmed the discussions in the previous sections that it is
important for plasma to produce a large ignition kernel size greater
than the critical radius to enhance ignition. Moreover, a large
ignition kernel created by a pulsed microwave discharge can
enhance ignition to flame transition, while not enhancing flame
speed or lean burn limit.

To further increase the ignition volume, ignition pattern for-
mation by multi-laser beam guided microwave discharge was
investigated [233e235]. As shown in Fig. 3.14(a), by using two
parallel laser beams generated by low energy 150e200 fs seed laser
the
pulses and an overlapping subcritical microwave pulse,
extremely weak ionization in the parallel laser beams localizes the
microwave energy deposition and creates a larger ignition volume.
Fig. 3.14(b) shows that by using a similar technique, a well-designed
square ignition pattern can be formed. In Fig. 3.14(c), by using the
combination of laser ionization and a gliding arc, the gliding arc
trajectory can be controlled. The controlled ignition pattern for-
mation provides an innovative way to enhance ignition by creating
an ignition kernel larger than the critical flame initiation radius.

Another way to create a large ignition volume is to use a gliding
arc [38,82,89,111]. Recently, the dynamics of gliding has been
studied by using high speed imaging and OH LIF imaging [111,236].
Fig. 3.15 (left) shows the time-resolved observation of gliding arc
short cutting events and the dependence of emission intensity on
time. It is seen that as a new pathway was formed at 50 ms at the

centimeters [236].

upstream of the gliding arc, the luminescence intensity of down-
stream gliding arc decreased. The decay time was in the order of
500 ms, comparable to the ignition delay time of n-heptane at
1100 K. The long decay time of a large short-cutting gliding arc can
contribute to ignition enhancement of a large volume. Fig. 3.15
(right) shows the dependence of OH PLIF on the flow rate. It is
seen that with the increase in flow rate, large scale (~0.5e1 cm)
distributed OH formation zones were observed. Although the
mechanism of the formation is still under-investigation, the large
scale OH distributions suggest that a gliding arc at turbulent flow
can enhance ignition by creating large ignition kernels.

More recently, ignition and mixing enhancement using arc
instability has also been studied [237,238]. As shown in Fig. 3.16, a
short pulse high voltage discharge can produce flow turbulence via
different mechanisms in a high speed flow, which include local
superheating of the gas; discharge-induced shock wave, photo-
dissociation and photo-ionization; and unsteady artificial separa-
tion inflow in disturbed zone [238]. The large unstable flow
structures and the local heating, photoionization, and fuel oxida-
tion will enhance ignition initiation and fuel/air mixing.

With the fundamental mechanisms of plasma enhanced com-
bustion appropriately understood, one of the most important
things is to understand how plasma can reduce activation energy of
fuel oxidation, deposit energy to mixture, decompose fuel and
reduce the mixture Lewis number, and model the discharge

dynamics. This requires fundamental studies of plasma combustion
chemistry with advanced diagnostics in well-defined flame ge-
ometries to isolate the complicated couplings between different
mechanisms.

4. Kinetic studies of plasma assisted combustion using
idealized experiments

With the development of plasma technology and advanced laser
diagnostics, significant progress has been made in developing new
experimental platforms and diagnostic techniques for plasma
assisted combustion and in understanding the underlying
enhancement mechanisms of the plasma assisted combustion
(Fig. 1.3). This section reviews the recent progress in the study of
kinetic effects of non-equilibrium plasma on different combustion
phenomena, including ignition, extinction, and flame propagation.

4.1. Kinetic process in plasma discharge

In 2001, the first work using nanosecond pulsed discharge to
assist H2 oxidation was published by Starikovskaia et al. [239]. The
kinetic process of H2 oxidation in a stoichiometric H2/air mixture
activated by nanosecond pulsed discharge was studied at total
pressures between 1 and 8 Torr and ambient temperature. The
discharge device consisted of a quartz tube of length 200 mm and
diameter 47 mm with a high voltage plate electrode and a ringed
low voltage electrode with surfaces made of aluminum. Impulses of
negative polarity voltage of amplitude 13 kV, 25 ns duration at
FWHM with repetition frequency of f 1⁄4 40 Hz. The transition ra-
diation of H2 (a
u) was used to reconstruct the absolute
concentration of excited H2 in the mixture and compared with that
with numerical modeling. Reasonable agreement was reported.
Numerical modeling was further conducted employing a kinetic
scheme consisting of about 750 species and 8700 reactions for H2/
air mixtures.

into H3

was limited due to the low concentration of H2

through the reaction O2 þ e / O þ O

atomic O increased due to the dissociative quenching of N2(B3Pg)

and N2(A3Su
). Further production channels of atomic O included

the destruction of O2
. As the atomic O accumulation took place, it
began to convert into H and OH in the reaction with H2. (3) The
branching reaction O þ H2(n 1⁄4 1) / H þ OH(6 1⁄4 1),along with the
reverse process, was predominant up to the start of the next pulse,
being the main step of the water formation chain. Nitrogen in
þ
metastable state N2(A3Su
), in the reaction of dissociative quenching
by O2, produced atomic O into the system. As a result of the tri-
molecular reaction (R7) produced HO2 and H2O2 via (R6). H2O
formation from HO2 reacting with OH was observed. (4) At the final
stage H and OH was formed via reaction (R3). Moreover, using the
kinetic modeling, the kinetic involvement of atomic N and NOx was
identified. This study demonstrated that atomic O production is a
very important kinetic process in plasma assisted combustion.

To understand the reaction pathways of atomic O production,
Uddi et al. [160] conducted atomic O measurement in a rectangular
shaped quartz reactor with nanosecond pulsed discharges using
the Two Photon Laser Induced Fluorescence (TALIF) technique. The
time histories of the absolute concentrations of atomic O were
measured in CH4/air and C2H4/air mixtures after excitation of a
single 25 ns discharge pulse with peak voltage 20 kV. Fig. 4.2 shows

the experimental results of time-dependent atomic O mole frac-
tions generated by a single pulse discharge in air and CH4/air
mixture at P 1⁄4 60 Torr. The peak mole fraction in air at 60 Torr is
(cid:2)4, with decay occurring on a time scale of
approximately 0.5 (cid:4) 10
about 2 ms. Peak mole fraction in a stoichiometric CH4/air mixture
was found to be nearly the same to that in pure air, but the rate of
decay was faster by a factor two to three. In C2H4/air mixture at
F 1⁄4 0.5, the peak atomic O concentration was reduced by a factor of
approximately four, compared to pure air, and the rate of decay
increased by approximately two-orders of magnitude due to the
greatly increased reaction rate of atomic O with C2H4 compared to
with CH4 at room temperature. The results in C2H4/air mixture are
shown in Fig. 4.3.

The experimental results were further compared with numeri-
cal modeling with GRI Mech 3.0 [240] for CH4 and USC Mech II [241]
for C2H4, respectively, with combination of an air plasma model
[160]. Excellent agreement was reported for both mechanisms. The
numerical modeling also indicated that the primary formation
pathways of atomic O were from electron impact reaction,

CH4/air mixture at P 1⁄4 60 Torr and F 1⁄4 1.0, Dashed line, GRI Mech 3.0 [160].

The rapid reaction between fuel (e.g., C2H4) and atomic O
reduced the atomic O concentration quickly in fuel/air mixtures
(Fig. 4.3) and initiated the combustion process for ignition. This
direct diagnostics significantly advanced our understanding of
plasma assisted combustion at the elementary reaction level.

To understand the formation pathways of atomic O production
by excited N2 (N2(A), N2(B) and N2(C)) at higher pressure, the ab-
solute number density of N2(A) was measured by Cavity Ring Down
Spectroscopy (CRDS) and the densities of N2(B) and N2(C) were
measured by Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES) in a nanosecond
pulsed discharge at atmospheric pressure in air [161]. The results in
Fig. 4.4 show that in air plasma, the rise of atomic O concentration
synchronizes with the decay of N2(B) and N2(C), that is, oxygen
collisions with N2(B) and N2(C) are the major reaction pathways to
produce atomic O in addition to direct electron impact oxygen
dissociation.

Direct measurement of atomic O production was also done in
CH4/O2/Ar diffusion flames with nanosecond discharge at 60 Torr
[43]. Fig. 4.5 shows that comparison of atomic O and CH2O for-
mation with and without CH4 in oxygen. It is seen that high O

concentration was produced by plasma discharge via reaction R8b
in oxygen without fuel and collisions between O2 and excited Ar,
but the plasma produced atomic O radicals were consumed by
reacting with CH4 to form CH2O in a fuel lean mixture. Recent
experimental and numerical studies of in situ plasma discharge
CH4/O2/He diffusion flames [106,144] showed that the following
two reactions also contribute significantly in atomic O production,
respectively, by approximately 2% and 26% via reactions,

In addition to the measurements of radical production by
plasma discharge, in situ measurements of plasma generated in-
termediate species by mid-IR laser absorption spectroscopy of
C2H4/Ar and C2H4/O2/Ar mixtures activated by a nanosecond
repetitively pulsed plasma were also conducted in a low temper-
ature flow reactor (below 500 K) at a pressure of 60 Torr [168]. A
recently developed kinetic mechanism (HP-Mech) for plasma
activated C2H4 oxidation was assembled [168,242]. Fig. 4.6 shows
that there exist three fuel consumption pathways for plasma acti-
vated low temperature C2H4 oxidation: (1) a plasma activated low
temperature fuel oxidation pathway via O2 addition reactions (left)
to form RO2 and O2C2H4OH; (2) a direct fragmentation pathway via
collisional dissociation by electrons, ions, and electronically excited

molecules (top right); and (3) a direct fuel oxidation pathway by
plasma generated radicals such as atomic O (middle). It was found
that the plasma activated low temperature oxidation pathway is
dominant and leads to a larger amount of formaldehyde formation
with lesser acetylene and negligible large hydrocarbon molecules
compared to the decomposition experiment. The results also
indicated that the latter two fuel consumption pathways were
strongly dependent on O2 and Ar concentrations due to their effect
on the production of atomic oxygen and excited Ar. The comparison
between model prediction and experiments in Fig. 4.7 shows that
although the HP-Mech model [168,242] improved the overall pre-
diction over USC-Mech II for plasma activated decomposition and
oxidation, both models failed to predict quantitatively the H2O and
CH4 formation. The results showed that the plasma combustion
kinetics has a large uncertainty for low temperature fuel oxidation.
Experimental data of intermediate species diagnostics are needed
for future model development in plasma-assisted combustion.

Moreover, the effects of plasma produced O3, O2(a

1Dg), and NOx
on ignition and flame propagation were also studied [156,157] and
will be discussed in the following sections.

4.2. Effects of plasma on ignition

One of the pioneering studies of plasma effect on ignition delay
time and plasma-combustion kinetics was conducted by Bozhen-
kov et al., in 2003 using nanosecond pulsed discharge in a shock
tube to study the plasma-combustion kinetics [213]. A uniform
nanosecond pulsed discharge in the form of the fast ionization
wave was organized in the dielectric section. The end plate (EP) of
the shock tube was a high voltage electrode of the discharge sys-
tem. The discharge initiation was synchronized with the reflected
shock wave. The peak voltage of the electric pulse varied from 100
to 160 kV with pulse duration of approximately 30e40 ns. The
results showed that the nanosecond pulsed discharge was capable
of activating the premixture behind the reflected shock wave nearly
instantaneously while not elevating the temperature. As shown in
Fig. 4.8, nanosecond discharge can significantly decrease the igni-
tion delay of H2 by nearly an order of magnitude. Similar obser-
vations were obtained for CH4 mixtures at pressures from 0.3 to
2.3 atm. This study was one of the first carefully designed experi-
ments to decouple the thermal effect of plasma on combustion and
kinetic effect. Further experiments showed no noticeable difference
of the voltage polarity effect on ignition delay measurements. The
uniformity of the nanosecond pulsed discharge was also confirmed
[112]. Along with the experiments, a kinetic model was also
developed to simulate the effect of plasma on the combustible
mixture. This work demonstrated the increased effectiveness or
efficiency of non-equilibrium excitation over equilibrium excitation
in a H2/O2/N2 system as shown in Fig. 4.9.

specific deposited energy of 10e30 mJ/cm3 lead to one order of
magnitude of ignition delay reduction for C1 to C5 alkanes. In
addition, the predicted results agreed well with the experimental
data. Analysis showed that the effect of non-equilibrium plasma on
ignition delay was primarily due to the production of atomic O and
H whereas atomic O was shown to be the most effective in
enhancing the ignition.

Despite the earnest efforts of Starikovskii et al., the experimental
results measured through optical emission spectroscopy did not
agree well with that of simulations, and still requires more detailed
studies. As pointed out by the authors, time-resolved and in situ
experimental measurements of the dominant radicals and in-
termediates are needed. Therefore, even though the experiments
were fairly well-designed, the kinetics has remained a significant
issue. In addition, the experiments were focused on high temper-
ature ignition above the critical branching temperature of R2.
Therefore, as discussed in Section 3.1, the major role of plasma was
to add radicals to bypass chain initiation reaction (R1) to accelerate
ignition.

Recently, Wu et al. [248] has investigated plasma assisted igni-
tion below self-ignition threshold in CH4, C2H6, C3H8 and C4H10/air
mixtures at atmospheric pressures at temperatures from 300 to
800 K in a reaction chamber with 10 Hz, 10 ns repetitive pulse

and open points correspond to calculations. The initial temperature was between 1430
and 1450 K and the pressure was between 0.4 and 0.5 atm [247].

Since the earlier work in 2003, more experiments were con-
ducted for a variety of
fuels, pressures and temperatures
[243e247]. Similar observations were obtained for C1 to C5 alkanes.

discharge with 20 kV. The reactant flow rate was set at approxi-
mately 20 cm/s to allow each discharge pulse to occur in a fresh gas
mixture. The time evolution of OH radicals in premixed fuel/air
flows in the afterglow was studied using OH PLIF. The results are
shown in Fig. 4.11. At 300 K, three different equivalence ratios were
studied (F 1⁄4 0.1, 1 and 3.0). By comparing the OH evolution curves,
the decay time of OH for the CH4 mixture was found to be the
longest, while those for butane appeared to be the shortest. This
was due to the increased H abstraction rate by OH for larger hy-
drocarbons. Moreover, the OH evolution curves changed signifi-
cantly when the temperature increased to 400 K. The CH4 curve
showed that the time for OH to reach its maximum increased to
about 10 ms. This timescale significantly exceeded the time of
plasma recombination under atmospheric pressure conditions. This
indicates that some chain propagation/branching reactions may
occur even at 400 K. A drastic change was observed when the
temperature was raised to 500 K. The time of maximum OH re-
mains in the range of 30e70 ms for all fuels. The increase in OH
density clearly demonstrated the chain development processes and
OH production continuation after the plasma channel recombina-
tion. Another noticeable change was the OH signal decay order,
which was reversed compared to the case at 400 K. A third stage of
OH was observed when the temperature reached 700 K and this
stage became to be clear at 800 K as shown in Fig. 4.11. The maxima
in OH concentration appeared in a single curve. The first peak may
be related to the initial OH production in the discharge. The second
peak is likely owing to chain reactions by the accumulation of in-
termediate species. The third peak may correspond to the low
temperature chemistry because it was only observed for C3H8 and
C4H10 mixture. The authors also reported that all attempts with
current available models failed to predict these results.

A later work by Starikovskiy [249] suggested a possible reason of
the difficulty to reproduce the experimental results was the lack of
vibrationalevibrational excitation of HO2. Vibrational excitation
began to be very efficient at E/N 1⁄4 80e100 Td. The vibratio-
nalevibrational energy exchange between excited N2 and HO2 is
near-resonant process.

HO2(n2 þ n3) 1⁄4 H þ O2

(R32)

(R33)

The vibrational quantum energy of N2 is very close to the
vibrational excitation of HO2 where n2 vibrational mode of HO2
means OeH stretch and n3 means OeO stretch. Thus, the vibra-
tionalevibrational energy exchange can be extremely fast even at
room temperature. The fast excitation and decomposition of
vibrationally excited HO2 leads to the canceling of the chain
termination reactions and allows the oxidation process to develop
even below the self-ignition threshold. By including the vibratio-
nalevibrational excitation and decomposition of HO2, kinetic
models can reasonably predict the experimental results of OH
evolution curves reported in Ref. [248]. However, in this model,
many of the low temperature oxidation pathways (in Fig. 4.6) were
not considered. Given the large uncertainty and the pressure
dependence in the rate constants related to reactions R32 and R33,
quantitative diagnostic methods for HO2 time evolution are
needed. This diagnostic method will be discussed in Section 5.

Yin et al. [250] has developed a similar quartz reactor and
measured ignition delays, time-resolved temperature, and OH
concentrations
H2/air mixtures
(T 1⁄4 473e500 K). The reactor was made of a 280 mm long,
22 (cid:4) 10 mm rectangular cross section quartz channel with wall
thickness of 1.75 mm. The entire assembly was heated in a tube
furnace to improve the plasma stability. The ignition delay times

were measured by monitoring the intensity of excited OH (OH*)
emission at 310 nm through the side wall of the reactor, using a
narrow bandpass filter (centered at 310 ± 2 nm, bandpass 10 ± 2 nm
FWHM), a photomultiplier tube (PMT), and an oscilloscope. A
typical emission trace in H2/air mixture excited by the plasma with
initial temperature, Tini 1⁄4 473 K is shown in Fig. 4.12. Emission
during the discharge burst was primarily from N2 second positive
band system. N2 emission decayed rapidly after each discharge
pulse and disappeared after the burst. Self-sustained OH(A-X)
emission appeared after the burst and lasted for several millisec-
onds which indicated ignition as shown in Fig. 4.12. It was found
that ignition delay times increased steeply as the number of pulses
was reduced. OH LIF and two-line OH LIF were used to measure the
absolute OH concentrations and temperatures of the mixtures,
respectively. For two-line OH LIF, the laser system was tuned to two
absorption transitions in the OH A-X (1,0) band, Q1(5) at
282.667 nm and Q2(11) at 285.073 nm, chosen for optimum
sensitivity in preheated mixtures during ignition, from 500 to
2000 K.

can be seen the temperature immediately after the discharge burst
was Tf z 700e750 K, which is approximately 200e250 K higher
than the initial temperature of the mixture and significantly lower
than the autoignition temperature at these conditions, ~900 K.
Numerical modeling results were also shown in Fig. 4.13 as solid
and dashed lines. The modeling well predicted the experiments
and revealed that H atom accumulation (up to 0.1%) during the
discharge primarily by R2 reaction together with temperature rise
introduced ignition.

Besides the reactive radicals and intermediates, plasma can also
produce stable species, such as NOx. To study the effect of plasma
generated NOx on ignition, a gliding arc integrated counterflow
system was developed to measure the decrease of ignition tem-
perature on H2/CH4/air diffusive ignition systems [38,138,139]. The
counterflow system can be characterized by a flow velocity gradient
(strain rate or inverse of residence time) on the centerline near the
stagnation plane of the two opposite jets. The ignition temperature
measurements were conducted at atmospheric pressure for CH4
and H2/air diffusion flame. NOx was quantified by Fourier Trans-
form Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). The experimental results
together with computational results for H2/air diffusion flame are
shown in Fig. 4.14. It can be seen that with the plasma activation,
ignition temperatures decreased significantly compared to the case
of heated air (without plasma activation). To mimic the effect of
plasma enhancement, 3600 ppm NO and 1200 ppm NO2 were
added into the heated air. The ignition temperature measurements
showed good agreement between the case of NOx addition and the
results of gliding arc. Similar results were also obtained for CH4/air
diffusive ignition. Numerical simulations were conducted to un-
derstand the effect of ignition enhancement for methane with NO
the
addition [138,139]. Fig. 4.15 shows the dependence of
maximum temperature on stretch rate at different oxidizer tem-
peratures. It is seen that with NO addition at low oxidizer tem-
perature (e.g., 900e1000 K), a low temperature ignition limit
appears. That means that plasma produced NO can accelerate
ignition by causing low temperature ignition which does not occur
without NO.

The authors further discussed the formation and catalytic cycle
of NOx for CH4 and H2 ignitions. The electron impact reactions (R8a)

For CH4/air diffusion flame, at low temperature, the reaction

CH3 þ O2(þM) / CH3O2(þM)

converts CH3 radicals inactive CH3O2 and thus the ignition process
is slowed down. With the addition of NO, CH3O2 is catalytically
oxidized by the NOx reaction pathways,

CH3O2 þ NO / CH3O þ NO2

CH3 þ NO2 / CH3O þ NO

(R39)

to produce CH3O and subsequently H radicals so that ignition will
be enhanced at low temperature. For H2/air ignition system, the
formed inactive HO2 radical via termination reaction (R7) is cata-
lyzed by NO via the following pathways,

HO2 þ NO / OH þ NO2

H þ NO2 / OH þ NO

This process explained the catalytic effect of NOx on ignition in

plasma assisted combustion at low temperature.

4.3. The thermal and kinetic effects of plasma on flame extinction

With the same experimental setup, Ombrello and coworkers
studied the effect of gliding arc discharge on CH4/air diffusion flame
extinction in a counterflow system at atmospheric pressure [38].
With plasma discharge of the airstream, up to a 220% increase in
the extinction strain rate was observed. The authors further
examined the impact of thermal and non-thermal mechanisms on
the extension of extinction strain rates by direct comparison of
measured temperature profiles via Rayleigh scattering thermom-
etry and OH number density profiles via OH PLIF. It was found that
the effect of the plasma on flame extinction was predominately
thermal [38] due to the fast recombination of radicals which were
generated by the discharge on the oxidizer side.

Recently Sun et al. [43,106] has conducted research about
plasma on flame extinction at low pressures (60 Torr) by coupling
nanosecond pulsed discharge with a counterflow system. The
experimental setup consisted of a counterflow burner, which was
located in a low pressure chamber. Two parallel bare copper elec-
trodes were located inside the tubes of the upper (oxidizer side)
burner to generate non-equilibrium discharge. Fig. 4.16(a)e(e)
shows images of flames with and without the nanosecond non-
equilibrium pulsed discharge at 60 Torr. The pulse repetition fre-
quencies were increased from 5 to 40 kHz. The discharge was
uniform in the transverse direction of the electrodes and no visible
filamentary structure was observed for repetition frequency from 5
to 40 kHz. Fig. 4.16(d) and (e) shows a visible plasma jet issuing
from the burner exit and reaching the reaction zone. The optical
emission in the afterglow of an Ar/O2 discharge is produced from
the relaxation processes of excited species like Ar*, O(1D), O(1S),
O2(a1Dg), and O2(b1Sg). During the relaxation processes, ground
state atomic O can be produced. Therefore, the visible emission
indicates that there exist significant concentrations of excited
species, radicals, and atoms between the nozzle exit and the reac-
tion zone that need to be quantitatively examined.

The absolute number density of atomic O was then quantified by
(TALIF) method
Two Photon Laser
Induced Fluorescence
[43,106,160,251] as shown in Fig. 4.17 and then used as a boundary
conditions in the numerical modeling [43]. The results of extinction
strain rate measurement together with numerical modeling shown

in Fig. 4.18 indicate that for a CH4/O2/Ar diffusion flame, with the
increase in discharge frequency on the oxidizer side, the extinction
strain rates extended significantly. At the same time, the oxidizer
side flow temperature also increased. In order to isolate the thermal
effect, the extinction strain rates with plasma activation and that of
just electrically heated flow were compared both experimentally
and numerically using measured atomic O concentrations as
boundary conditions. The results showed that even though the
discharge can generate a significant amount of atomic O, most of
the atomic O was quenched before being transported to the reac-
tion zone at low temperature conditions. At high oxidizer side flow
temperature conditions, the enhancement started to be more sig-
nificant. More detailed analysis showed that if the oxidizer tem-
perature was higher than a crossover temperature, which was
about 900e1000 K at low pressure, approximately 80% of the
atomic O can be transported to the reaction zone to enhance the
flame. Therefore, in order to observe the kinetic enhancement from
plasma on flame, the oxidizer temperature must be higher than the
crossover temperature to avoid quenching.

One way to avoid quenching of the radicals is to add fuel into the
oxidizer stream. Following this idea, Sun and coworkers [106]
blended 2% CH4 into the oxidizer side stream and activated by
the plasma. In this way, the reactive species generated by the
plasma reacted with the fuel rather than being recombined or
quenched. After activation by the plasma, the CH4 added into the

oxidation and fuel reforming on the extension of extinction strain
rates. The comparison showed that the production of H2 from fuel
reforming can extend the extinction strain rate due to the increased
fuel reactivity. However, the extension owing to CH4 oxidation was
much more effective. This is because when the flame approaches
extinction, there is not enough residence time for the CH4 to
complete the oxidation reactions to release the chemical heat.
However, plasma can dramatically accelerate the CH4 oxidation to
release the chemical energy at low temperature. The prompt
chemical heat release extended the extinction limit.

The study in Refs. [43,106] demonstrated the effect of plasma-
produced species on flame extinction. The experiments success-
fully isolated the interaction between plasma and flame. However,
the lack of the coupling effect minimized the effect of the plasma on
the flame due to the short lifetime of reactive species. Thus, the
dominant effect of plasma on the reaction zone was not free from
thermal enhancement effects. Therefore, it is very important to
investigate the direct coupling effect between plasma and a flame,
where plasma kinetics pathways modify the flame kinetic path-
ways. In order to focus on the kinetic performance of the plasma/
flame interaction, Sun and coworkers [144] subsequently devel-
oped a novel well-defined counterflow flame system with an in situ
discharge using porous electrodes as shown in Fig. 4.21. In this way,
uniform discharge was generated between two burners as shown
in the embedded picture in Fig. 4.21.

The ignition and extinction characteristics were studied by
measuring the OH* emission intensity in the reaction zone since
ignition or extinction happens with an abrupt change of the OH*
emission. During the experiments, the strain rate (400 1/s), XO and
the discharge frequency (f 1⁄4 24 kHz) were held constant, while the
CH4 mole fraction on the fuel side, XF, was varied. The relationship
between OH* emission intensity as well as reaction zone peak
temperature and XF is shown in Fig. 4.22 with (a) XO 1⁄4 0.34 and (b)
0.62. The temperatures of the reaction zone were measured by the
Rayleigh scattering method. By starting from XF 1⁄4 0 and increasing
XF until it equaled 0.265, the OH* emission was negligible compared
to the background noise, and no reaction zone was observed in
Fig. 4.22(a). Further increase of XF caused an abrupt increase in OH*
emission intensity. This phenomenon was also identified by the
appearance of a visible flame, indicating that ignition occurred.
After ignition, further increase or decrease in XF only caused very
limited increase or decrease in the OH* emission intensity,
respectively. But when the XF was decreased to less than 0.20, an
abrupt decrease in the OH* intensity was observed and the visible

oxidizer flow was oxidized. The concentrations of the products and
atomic O were measured by FTIR, Gas Chromatography (GC) and
TALIF. The results are summarized in Figs. 4.5, 4.19 and Fig. 4.20. The
FTIR and GC measurements showed that with the increase in the
discharge repetition frequency, the CH4 oxidation ratio increased
significantly and the production of CO, CO2, H2, and H2O also
increased together with the increase in the flow temperature at the
nozzle exit. The experimental measurements were also compared
with numerical modeling. It was concluded that the modeling re-
sults deviated significantly from the experiments mainly due to the
uncertainty of the combustion kinetic mechanism at low temper-
ature conditions (below 700 K) and unknown plasma reaction
pathways. The path flux analysis revealed that O production by the
plasma is the major source to initiate the low temperature CH4
oxidation. Once O is generated by the discharge, it is consumed
rapidly by CH4 and its intermediate oxidized and dissociated
products. Only a small amount of O recombines to O2. The extinc-
tion strain rate measurements showed that with the increase in
discharge frequency (CH4 oxidation ratio), the extinction strain
rates extended significantly. Numerical modeling can fairly predict
the extinction strain rates with the FTIR and TALIF measured
speciation as boundary conditions. FTIR measurements indicated
significant amount of CO and H2 formation as a result of CH4
reforming. The authors further compared the effectiveness of CH4

flame emission disappeared, indicating the extinction. This hys-
teresis of OH* emission intensity between ignition and extinction
forms an S-curve of the flame which is the fundamental phenom-
ena of ignition and extinction. The local maximum temperature
measurement (reaction zone temperature) showed that the value
just before ignition was only 897 ± 50 K. With further increasing XF,
ignition occurred and the local maximum temperature increased to
approximately 1310 ± 80 K.

When XO was increased to 0.62, the ignition and extinction
limits (Fig. 4.22(b)) merged at XF 1⁄4 0.09, resulting in a monotonic
ignition and extinction S-curve Fig. 4.22(b). The temperature
measurements also demonstrated a similar monotonic increase in
the local maximum temperatures. The monotonic and fully
stretched ignition and extinction S-curve could be explained by the
fact that the plasma generated reactive species caused a transition
of flame stabilization mode from the extinction-controlled to the
ignition-controlled modes. This means that the extinction limit did
not exist by the plasma/combustion chemistry interaction (Fig. 1.4),

thus the chemistry of flame stabilization was fully dictated by the
ignition limit. These results were further confirmed by OH PLIF
measurements which were identical to the OH* emission results.

In order to further understand the underlying mechanisms,
numerical simulations were conducted at a condition prior to
ignition with XF 1⁄4 0.16 and XO 1⁄4 0.34 with constant electric field
assumption. As indicated in Fig. 4.23, the results of path flux
analysis showed that CH4 was predominantly dissociated to CH3 by
H abstraction through collision with OH, electrons, O and H. The
major reaction path of CH3 was the oxidization to CH2O and finally
to HCO, CO and CO2. OH and H (Fig. 4.23(b)) were predominantly
generated through the reactions between O and fuel/fuel-
fragments. Therefore, it can be concluded that O was the initia-
tion source of fuel oxidization and determined the population of
the radical pool as shown in Fig. 4.23(c).

The dominant formation pathway of O formation in this
experiment was from direct electron impact of O2, including re-
actions (R1)e(R3):

Once O(1D) and O

were produced, they were quickly quenched
or recombined with electrons, respectively, to produce O. Another
two important formation pathways of atomic O were from colli-
sions between O2 and He ions (He
). Once atomic O was formed, it
reacted with CH4 and its fragments to generate OH and H to further
oxidize CH4; only a small fraction of atomic O recombined to form
O3 and O2.

Since plasma is the source of radicals, the radical generation
from the plasma can change the chain branching effects in the re-
action zone. Reaction R8 generated O which reacted with CH4 to
generate CH3 and OH through reaction R41. Together with reaction
R42, the generation of CH3 promoted reaction R43 to generate H.
The generation of H promoted the chain branching reaction R2 to
generate OH and O and feedback to build up the radical pool.

A global reaction can be obtained by adding the above reactions

(R44)

One can see clearly from the above global reaction that one high
energy electron can lead to three radicals and other intermediate
species at low temperature to decrease the global activation energy
of fuel oxidation as indicated in Fig. 1.4.

Without plasma, the flame chemistry could not sustain the
chain-branching reaction below the crossover temperature for the
flames, exhibiting hysteresis between ignition and extinction
(Fig. 1.4). However, the plasma enabled the chain branching reac-
tion to be sustainable even at low temperatures by the positive loop
between fuel oxidation and regeneration of the radical pool (R44).
The dominant radical formation path was controlled by plasma,
rather than the H þ O2 1⁄4 OH þ O reaction. Thus, the strong radical
pool significantly decreased the global activation energy for fuel
oxidation at low temperatures. Finally, the excessive production of
radicals from the plasma diminished the hysteresis between igni-
tion and extinction.

As shown in Fig. 4.23, the oxidation path of CH4 is relatively
straight and does not contain any low temperature kinetics. In or-
der to examine the effect of plasma on the low temperature
chemical kinetics, dimethyl ether (DME) was employed as the fuel
by Sun et al. [107]. By replacing CH4 with DME and repeating the
experiments, similar folded S-curves were observed by recording
the OH PLIF. However, OH can only be used to characterize high
temperature chemistry rather than low temperature chemistry.
Therefore, CH2O PLIF [252,253] was used to characterize the effect
of plasma on low temperature chemistry. The relationship between
CH2O PLIF signal intensity (integration across burner gap) and fuel
mole fraction at the fuel side nozzle exit, XF, with a repetitive
plasma discharge is shown in Fig. 4.24 at f 1⁄4 24 kHz, and XO 1⁄4 0.4.
As shown in Fig. 4.24, with the increase of the fuel mole fraction
(XF), the CH2O PLIF signal intensity increases almost linearly. This

increasing XF, open square symbols: decreasing XF for DME) [107].

linear increase of the CH2O PLIF signal (proportional to CH2O
number density) with fuel mole fraction before ignition indicates
the occurrence of low temperature DME oxidation. In addition,
when the DME mole fraction at the fuel side nozzle exit is larger
than 9% at XO 1⁄4 0.4, ignition occurs with a sharp decrease in the
CH2O PLIF signal intensity. After the ignition, the CH2O PLIF signal
intensity becomes insensitive to the change in DME mole fraction.
On the other hand, when the DME mole fraction is decreased slowly
to 7% at XO 1⁄4 0.4, extinction occurs along with a rapid increase in
CH2O PLIF signal intensity. Similar results can also be observed at
XO 1⁄4 0.6 with ignition and extinction occurring at lower fuel mole
fractions.

In order to confirm whether this pronounced formation of CH2O
before ignition is a unique response of DME oxidation relevant to
the low temperature reactivity, numerical calculations for both
DME and the CH4 case [144] have been conducted. The modeling
results before ignition for both DME and CH4 as the fuels are also
shown in Fig. 4.24. It shows that the CH2O mole fraction is about
500 ppm for CH4 cases at the identical conditions shown in
Fig. 4.24, whereas the CH2O mole fraction in DME studied here are
about 10,000 ppm. The large difference in CH2O formation between
DME and CH4 suggests that the low temperature reactivity in DME
oxidation is activated by the in situ discharge.

In order to achieve the smooth transition between ignition and
extinction, the radical concentrations generated from the plasma
must be high enough. So the reaction fluxes for the low tempera-
ture pathway and the high temperature pathway can be compa-
rable at low temperature conditions. In an attempt to increase the
productivity of radicals, the discharge frequency is increased to
34 kHz and the results are shown in Fig. 4.25. A monotonic S-curve
without hysteresis between ignition and extinction is successfully
achieved by increasing the production of radicals. Therefore, a
smooth transition between low temperature chemistry and high
temperature chemistry is realized. This observation can be gener-
alized to other larger hydrocarbon fuels (such as n-heptane, jet fuel)
with two-stage ignition behaviors.

The authors conducted further numerical modeling and path
flux analysis was performed at XF 1⁄4 0.01, XO 1⁄4 0.4, f 1⁄4 24 kHz. As
shown in Fig. 4.26(a), approximately 37% of DME reacts with atomic
O to form OH and CH3OCH2. The formed OH abstracts H from DME
and continues to form DME radicals, CH3OCH2. At the very first
reaction step, about 54% of DME reacts with OH to form CH3OCH2.
There exist two reaction pathways for CH3OCH2 consumption. The
first channel is the decomposition of CH3OCH2 directly to CH2O and

dependence and very low DME concentration is chosen to prevent
excessive heat release. Without atomic O addition, the low temper-
ature chemistry is very slow at low pressure condition. The charac-
teristic time is approximately 1 s for the formation of CH2O.
However, with 1000 ppm atomic O addition, the low temperature
chemistry is significantly accelerated and the characteristic time for
CH2O formation is approximately 1 ms, three order of magnitude
faster than the case without O addition. Further path flux analysis
shows that atomic O addition significantly accelerates the reaction of
H
through
CH3OCH3 þ O 1⁄4 CH3OCH2 þ OH reaction. The subsequent formation
and isomerization of CH3OCH2O2, decomposition of CH2OCH2O2H to
form CH2O are considerably fast. In addition, approximately 90% of
CH2O formation is through the low temperature chemistry channel
(formation of CH3OCH2O2), as demonstrated in Fig. 4.26(a). There-
fore, radical addition (atomic O production from the plasma in this
study) activates the low temperature chemistry by initiating the H
abstraction reaction of DME and modifies the global characteristic
time scale of low temperature oxidation of DME. O addition increases
the total enthalpy of the mixture and can cause approximately 9 K
temperature rise if the same amount of enthalpy increase is used for
thermal heating.

Through both the experiments and numerical modeling, Sun
et al. [107] proved that CH2O formation is dominated by PA-LTC of
DME oxidation and atomic O production from plasma and subse-
quent radical productions initiate and control DME low tempera-
ture oxidation.

4.4. Effects of plasma on flames: the role of O3 and O2(a

1Dg)

Similar to flame extinction, the radical pool produced by the
flame is rich and the kinetic effect of plasma on flame speed is
difficult to be observed and quantified without a significant amount
of energy input. Ombrello and his co-workers investigated the ef-

fect of O3 [157] and excited oxygen (singlet delta oxygen, O2(a
[156] on flame propagation using lifted flames in which the flame
lift-off height is very sensitive to flame speed. Therefore, the plasma
enhancement effect on flame speed can be identified without a
significant amount of energy input. The lifted flame burner con-
sisted of a central fuel jet with an inner diameter of 0.271 mm that
was located in a 90 mm inner diameter quartz tube to contain the

CH3. This is a typical high temperature reaction pathway. The sec-
ond channel
is CH3OCH2 going through the low temperature
chemistry reaction pathway via O2 addition to form CH3OCH2O2
(RO2 radical). The subsequent isomerization of RO2 to R0OOH and
decomposition to OH and CH2O are the major (41%) formation
pathways of CH2O at low temperature. As shown in Fig. 4.26(b), the
dominant formation pathways of OH and H are related with atomic
O reactions. Therefore, atomic O produced by the plasma is the
critical radical controlling the oxidation of DME at low temperature
conditions. The major formation pathways (54%) of atomic O are
from direct electron impact of O2 (reactions R8a, R8b and R8c) and
also the collision between He ions (He
) and O2 (R29) which counts
38% towards the formation of atomic O.

In order to further examine the effect of atomic O production on
the PA-LTC, SENKIN [254] conducted homogeneous ignitions calcu-
lations employing a DME kinetic mechanism [255] with DME/O2/He
(0.003/0.1/0.897 in mole fraction) mixture and investigated at
72 Torr, 650 K with and without 1000 ppm atomic O addition,
respectively. The simulation is conducted at constant temperature
condition to avoid further complicated kinetic temperature

and microwave discharge device, respectively.

1Dg) were produced by a DBD device

The effect of O3 was first studied on the C3H8/O2/N2 lifted flame.
O3 was generated by passing ultra-high purity O2 through a
dielectric barrier discharge device. The O3 produced by the DBD
device was quantified using a one-pass, line-of-sight absorption
cell by employing BeereLambert's law in the flow downstream of
where the O2 and N2 streams merged [157].

The lifted flame was established for fixed oxidizer co-flow ve-
locity and O2 loading (18% in 82% N2). The lifted flame speeds were
evaluated based upon the axial local flow velocity from the simi-
larity solution of the cold flow at the measured liftoff heights with
initial jet velocities as summarized in Fig. 4.27. It is clearly shown
that there was an enhancement of the lifted flame speed with
increasing O3 concentration and the enhancement increased with
the increase in the O3 concentration. Approximately 3% of flame
speed increase was observed by 1000 ppm O3 addition, which was
much less than the effect on ignition.

Numerical simulations were conducted for equivalence ratios of
0.8e1.2 with and without 5000 ppm of O3. The results showed that
the laminar flame speed was enhanced more for lean and rich
equivalence ratios than at stoichiometric because lean and rich
premixed flames have relatively weaker reactivity and lower
chemical heat release compared to the stoichiometric condition.
The analysis showed the O3 decomposition through

O3 þ M / O2 þ O þ M

to produce atomic O in the preheating zone. The atomic O rapidly
reacts with the fuel via reactions

C3H8 þ O / nC3H7 þ OH

(R46)

(R47)

OH can also be produced from the reaction of O3 with H via

O3 þ H / O2 þ OH

(R48)

Then OH further reacts with fuel and fuel fragments to cause
heat release in the pre-heat zone of the flame to enhance flame
propagation speed.

unlike the lifted flame at atmospheric pressure described in the
work related to O3, a cold flow similarity solution does not correctly

method was used to estimate the amount of flame speed

amount of O2(a

mately 1% flame speed enhancement.

netic mechanisms involving O2(a

about O2(a
later.

Wang et al. [158] investigated the effect of O3 addition on the
enhancement of flame speed directly for premixed CH4/air flames
using the Heat Flux method. The O3 was generated by a DBD ozone
generator installed in the O2 gas line. A heat flux burner was
adopted for the adiabatic burning velocity measurement and all
experiments were performed at atmospheric pressure. The burning
velocity enhancement is shown in Fig. 4.29 with 2330 ppm and
3730 ppm O3 addition as a function of equivalence ratio for CH4/air
flame. Noticeable burning velocity enhancement was observed and
the enhancement was more significant at off-stoichiometric con-
ditions rather than at stoichiometric conditions. With 3730 ppm O3
addition in the oxidizer, experimental results showed ~8% flame
speed increase in fuel rich mixture and ~3.5% flame speed increase
for the stoichiometric mixture. An O3 kinetic mechanism involving
16 elementary reactions together with GRI-Mech 3.0 [240] was
composed and validated through PREMIX [262] calculation, which
gave good predictions of the burning velocities with and without
O3 addition as shown in Fig. 4.29. The simulation showed that the
atomic O radicals contributed by O3 in the preheating zone initiated
and accelerated the chain-branching reactions and consequently
increased the flame speed.

Similar experiments were conducted on the identical experi-
[159].

mental platform for H2/CO/N2/air premixed flames

Experimental data showed significant enhancement of the burning
velocities due to O3 addition. With 8500 ppm O3 addition,
maximum 18.74% of burning velocity enhancement was observed
at an equivalence ratio of F 1⁄4 0.7.

By summarizing available data for CH4 [158,263,264], and CO/H2
[159], approximately 1% flame speed enhancement can be achieved
by every 1000 ppm O3 addition at 1 atm, which is far smaller than
the kinetic effect of ozone on ignition and low temperature fuel
oxidation.

Recently, a novel method to establish self-sustaining cool
diffusion flames with well-defined boundary conditions has been
experimentally demonstrated by adding ozone into the oxidizer
stream in a counterflow configuration [108] (Fig. 4.30). It was found
that the formation of atomic oxygen via the decomposition of
ozone dramatically shortens the induction timescale of low tem-
perature chemistry, extending the flammable region of cool flames,
and enables the establishment of self-sustaining cool flames at
pressure and time scales at which normal cool flames may not be
observable. Cool flame chemistry [265e268] has been studied in
the past for the interest of engine knock [267] and fuel reforming
[265] in stirred reactor or flow reactor. However, this new method,
for the first time, provided an opportunity to stabilize and study
cool flame dynamics, structure, and chemistry simultaneously in
well-known flame geometry at atmospheric pressure without
oscillation nature. Extinction limits of n-heptane/oxygen cool
diffusion flames were measured. A cool diffusion flame diagram for
four different flame regimes was experimentally measured. Nu-
merical simulations showed that the extinction limits of cool
diffusion flames were strongly governed by species transport and
low temperature chemistry activated by ozone decomposition. The
structure of cool diffusion flame was further investigated by
measuring the temperature and species distributions with a micro-
probe sampling technique. It was found that the model over-
predicts the rate of n-heptane oxidation, the heat release rate,
and the flame temperature. Measurements of intermediate species,
such as CH2O, acetaldehyde, C2H4, and CH4 indicated that the
model over-predicted the QOOH thermal decomposition reactions
to form olefins, resulting in substantial over-estimation of C2H4,
and CH4 concentrations. The new experimental method of cool
flame provides an unprecedented platform to understand cool
flame and low temperature chemistry.

The ozone assisted cool flames supported the discussions in
Section 3, that is, plasma enhances ignition and low temperature
fuel oxidation kinetically more than high temperature flame
propagation. In future research, if a self-sustaining premixed cool
flame is established by a similar method and appropriate diagnostic
methods are developed, this method will bridge our knowledge gap
of cool flames for more than one century. At high pressure, the cool
flame chemistry will be enhanced. Quantitative study of cool

limitations include interference from Rayleigh scattering as well as
plasma emission. Since the number densities of neutral species are
much higher than the number density of free electrons in non-
equilibrium plasmas, the Rayleigh signal
is several orders of
magnitude larger than the Thomson signal. However, since Doppler
broadening is inversely proportional to the square root of the mass
of the particle, and the mass of neutral species is about four orders
of magnitude higher than that of free electrons, the Thomson
scattering line width is significantly broader than that of the Ray-
leigh scattering. So several possible techniques for filtering the
Rayleigh signal, including selective absorption and masking, can be
applied to filter the Thomson scattering signal. The resulting
Thomson scattering spectrum can be approximated by a Gaussian
line shape if the electron energy distribution is Maxwellian, which
can be used for inference of the average electron energy (electron
temperature). The integrated Thomson scattering cross section is
(cid:2)25 cm2. Details on data processing for Thomson scat-

tering can be found in Ref. [270].

In low electron density plasmas, where the incident light
wavelength is much shorter than the effective distance between
free electrons (proportional to Debye length), the Thomson scat-
tering is considered incoherent, and thus the total intensity of the
scattering is simply the sum of the intensities from each scattering
electron. This is often described by the dimensionless parameter
a 1⁄4 1/(klD), where k is the scattering wave vector magnitude
(proportional to 1/l), and lD is the Debye length. If a << 1, free
electrons and ions do not significantly affect each other.

Fig. 5.1 shows a schematic of the Thomson Scattering experi-
mental setup that was used by Roettgen et al. [270]. A frequency
doubled (532 nm) Nd:YAG laser, with a pulse energy of ~600 mJ at
30 Hz repetition rate, serves as the pump source. This beam is
focused into a glass test cell which can be filled with different gas
mixtures at different pressures. The laser beam enters and exits the
test cell through windows at Brewster's angle to reduce stray light.

beam direction to optimally collect the scattered photons from the
beam. The collimated scattering signal is then sent through an
image rotator (three silver protected mirrors), which rotates both
the image (to vertical orientation) and the polarization (to hori-
zontal), since horizontal polarization maximizes the grating effi-
ciency. The scattered light is then focused down onto a vertical slit

Thomson scattering signal is collected from a 3 mm long, ~60

signals over this region.

directly from HWHM from the Gaussian fit. The electron number
density is proportional to the integrated intensity of the Thomson
profile. So calibration of the integrated intensity by pure rotational
N2 Raman spectrum was conducted to put the electron number
density on an absolute scale.

flames may provide a key solution to solve engine knocking and
develop new engine technologies.

It is worth nothing that the cool flame discussed above in
Fig. 4.30 is controlled by low temperature chemistry of fuels (for-
mation and decomposition of QOOH) which is different from fuel
oxidation at low temperature condition. Another type of direct low
temperature fuel oxidation by plasma discharge for small hydro-
carbon fuels without low temperature chemistry had been also
reported before by Kim et al. [269] in a plasma assisted premixed
combustion system with ultra-lean CH4/air mixture (Fig. 4.31). At
low equivalence ratios, this low temperature flame was observed
without the ignition by the surrounding high temperature flame. It
was found that the temperature of the flame could be lower than
500 K. Because CH4 has no low temperature chemistry, as reported
low temperature flames by the authors is more like the flame
regime shown in Figs. 1.4 and 4.22b (for CH4 also). This low tem-
perature flame is initiated by direct O production via reactions R8
and R9 and the subsequent partial fuel oxidation via reaction
channels shown in Fig. 4.23. Therefore, it should be noted that
different from the cool flames (radical production via plasma
assisted QOOH formation and isomerization) of n-heptane, the low
temperature CH4 flame observed [269] is more likely the plasma
assisted direct CH4 partial oxidation/reforming via atomic O pro-
duction [40]. These two flames, although both have low tempera-
ture, have different kinetic mechanisms and should not be
confused.

5. Advanced diagnostics for plasma assisted combustion

5.1. Measurements of plasma properties

5.1.1. Thomson scattering for electron density and electron
temperature measurement

The most beneficial advantage of non-equilibrium plasma on
combustion enhancement is the radical production at low tem-
perature conditions. Through the path flux analysis shown in Sec-
tion 4.2, electron number density and electron temperature are two
important parameters determining radical production through
electron impact reactions. Therefore, the measurement of electron
density and electron temperature is very important for the study of
plasma assisted combustion and the validation of kinetic models.
Thomson scattering is an elastic scattering process involving
photons scattering off of a free charged particle. This diagnostic
technique is a non-intrusive, point measurement technique, and is
therefore used to measure spatial and temporal electron number
density, and electron temperature [270]. The major limitation of
Thomson scattering is its weak scattering signal intensity owing to
the low number density of free electrons in the plasma. Other

ecules in the rotational level J 1⁄4 6 (calculated from Boltzmann

(cid:2)3. After this, the electron density

decayed exponentially over 3 ms. Peak electron temperature
measured was approximately 4 eV. Thomson scattering technique
is a diagnostic tool to investigate these two critical parameters for
plasma assisted combustion and can provide valuable input pa-
rameters for numerical modeling.

Note that the Thomson scattering technique requires expensive
equipment setup. Alternative electron number density measure-
ments can also be made by using the Stark line broadening and the
optical emission spectroscopy line-ratio method, respectively, in
different ranges of electron number densities [272].

5.1.2. Electric field measurement

Another key parameter determining the electron energy is the
reduced electrical field E/N where E is the electric field and N is the
particle number density which is determined by temperature and
pressure. Due to the effect of dielectrics and formation of sheath,
the calculation of electric field in the bulk plasma region is not
straightforward. Therefore, measurement of the electric field in the
plasma discharge is very beneficial for both doing experiments and
modeling. Several methods have been reported for the measure-
ment of the electric field in the plasma discharge.

In 1992, Gavrilenko et al. [273] reported that coherent IR
emission from H2 molecule can be induced by laser light and a
static electric field. The IR intensity depends quadratically on the
intensity of the electric field. Therefore, this effect can be utilized to
develop a nonlinear-optics method for the measurement of electric
fields.

Based on this seminal work, Yatom et al. [274] measured the
electrical field in a nanosecond H2 plasma channel at 2 (cid:4) 105 Pa by
the Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman scattering method (CARS). CARS is
based on the generation of coherent infrared radiation as a result of
the biharmonic laser pumping of a symmetrical diatomic molecule
in an external electric field. The dipole moment of the molecules is
induced by the electric field therefore allowing the IR vibrational
transitions in the dipole approximation. In the study of Ref. [274], A
pump laser beam at l 1⁄4 532 nm was coaligned with the Stokes
beam at l 1⁄4 683 nm to generate Anti-Stokes (l 1⁄4 436 nm) and IR
(l 1⁄4 2.4 mm) radiation. The electric field can be then calculated as

s

I2:4

(5.3)

where I2.4 is the intensity of IR signal, I436 is the intensity of the anti-
Stokes signal, I532 is the intensity of the pump laser, and C is the
constant that depends on the experimental conditions. This tech-
nique still requires calibration of the constant C by performing the
experiment in the given optical setup with a uniform and known
electric field. By using this method, the electric field intensities of
up to 30 kV/cm was reported for an experiment by applying
~100 kV high voltage pulse to a blade cathode placed at a distance
of 20 mm from the anode.

Using H2 as the active species, high signal-to-noise ratio and
measurement sensitivity can be achieved owing to the large Raman
cross section of H2 [275]. It becomes challenging to measure the
electric field in N2 or air plasma. In 2009, Ito et al. [276] demon-
strated the feasibility of electric field measurement based on the
field-induced coherent Raman scattering in N2 containing gas at
atmospheric pressure for the first time. The minimum detectable
field strength in air was as low as 100 V/mm. The detailed diag-
nostic study of the N2 CARS based electric field measurement can
be found in a recent work by Lempert et al. [275].

Starikovskaia et al. [277] measured the electric field in surface
dielectric barrier discharge by measuring the relative intensity of
the second positive (N2(C3Pu) (cid:2) N2(B2Pg), y' (cid:2) y00 1⁄4 0e0,

y0 (cid:2) y00 1⁄4 0e0, l 1⁄4 391.1 nm) systems of nitrogen. In order to link the
intensity ratio of the two bands of N2 to the electric field, two ap-
proaches can be applied. The first approach assumes quasi-steady-
state. So the rate of population by direct electronic impact is equal
to the rate of depopulation due to emission and quenching. The
ratio of rate constants of excitation, kC/kB, depends upon the ratio of
population of excited levels. The population of excited species and
optical emission are then related to each other. On the other hand,
the ratio of kC/kB can be calculated for a given EEDF using known
cross sections. Therefore, electric field can be solved from the
emission spectroscopy. The second approach requires calibration of
the ratio of emissions of these two excited levels under fixed known
E/N values in non-sustained discharge system. Employing this
technique, 700e1000 Td reduced electric field values were calcu-
lated and reported in surface dielectric barrier discharge [277].

5.2. Measurements of plasma generated excited species

5.2.1. Measurement of ozone

Plasma can generate atomic O efficiently through electron
impact reactions with O2. At low temperature conditions (below
500 K) without the presence of fuel, atomic O recombines with O2
quickly to form ozone (O3). O3 has very long lifetime which is of
approximately 3 days at room temperature, 1.5 h at 400 K and
1.5 s at 500 K. O3 is one of the strongest oxidizers and can be effi-
ciently produced at high pressure conditions. The concentration of
O3 can be accurately quantified by absorption method.

Under conditions of weak absorption, the radiation intensity of a
light source (e.g., lasers, lamps) I(v) transmitted through a homo-
geneous gas sample is given by the BeereLambert Law:

where I0(v) is the incident intensity, k(v) is the absorption coeffi-
cient and labs is the absorption length. The absorption coefficient
k(v) is linked to the absorption cross section, s and the number
density N of the absorbers. With a known line strength, absorption
cross section, and the absorption length, the absolute density of the
absorber can be obtained [161].

In the work of Ref. [157] to quantify O3 concentration, a mercury

without the presence of O3, sozone is the absorption cross-section of
O3 at the excitation wavelength of 253.7 nm, and labs is the path
length. The authors [157] reported the concentration in parts per
million of O3 with an uncertainty of approximately 2% and a min-
imum detectable threshold of approximately 15 ppm in a micro-
wave discharge cell at 1 atm.

Singlet delta oxygen (O2(a

first electronically excited low-energy level at 0.98 eV. Singlet delta
oxygen has higher oxidation potential than O2 and has a signifi-
cantly long radiative lifetime which is longer than 4000 s, owing to

a spin forbidden transition to the ground state. Therefore, it has
attracted much attention.

5.2.3. Measurement of electronically and vibrationally excited
nitrogen

Stancu et al. [161] quantified electronically excited N2 (N2(A),
N2(B), and N2(C)) in a pin-to-pin nanosecond pulsed discharge at
1 atm. N2(A) was studied by probing the (2 ) 0) vibrational band of
þ
the N2 first positive system (B3Pg ) A3Su
) in the vicinity of 770 nm
using Cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS). CRDS is a technique
to improve the detection sensitivity from ppm to ppb level. Effec-
tive kilometer-absorption lengths in much smaller detection vol-
umes can be achieved with the CRDS technique using high-finesse
optical cavities.

In pulsed CRDS, a laser pulse is coupled into an optical cavity
formed usually by two highly reflective mirrors. Each time the
pulse reaches one of the mirrors a small fraction of the light leaks
out. When the laser is tuned to an absorption transition of the
species present inside the cavity, the decay of pulses is faster. The
difference of the decay times, t, for on-resonance and off-resonance
measurements is proportional to the absorption coefficient:

where c is the speed of light, L is the cavity length, labs is the ab-
sorption length and k(v) is the absorption coefficient as discussed in
Section 5.2.1. N2(A) number density can be then calculated using
the parameters on the right hand side of Eq. (5.5) measured in the
experiments.

In order to quantify N2(B), and N2(C), optical emission spec-
troscopy is employed by Stancu et al. [161] in the range of
500e800 nm for N2(B), and 300e500 nm for N2(C), respectively.
The local emissivity, el, of a volumetric light source is

where hv is the photon energy, A21 is the Einstein coefficient, N2 is
the population density of the upper state from where spontaneous
emission occurs and f(l) is the normalized profile function. The
emission intensity which is wavelength-dependent measured by a
spectrometer corresponds to the line-of-sight integration of emis-
sivity. In the pinepin electrode configuration used by Stancu et al.
[161], the discharge has cylindrical symmetry. An Abel transform is
applied to obtain the local distribution of the emissivity el(r).
However, the emission in absolute units is very difficult to obtain.
Typically a calibrated light source is required to calibrate experi-
mental parameters including the solid angle, length of collection

volume, response of the spectrometer and collection optics, and
quantum efficiency of the detector. After calibration, the local
particle densities of N2(B), and N2(C) can be obtained.

Measurement of vibrationally excited nitrogen N2(v) has also
been conducted by Macko et al. [278] using CRDS. The absolute
density of N2(v) at v 1⁄4 18 level in a 2.3 Torr DC glow discharge was
(cid:2)3 [278]. Even though Montello
reported to be (9 ± 3.5) (cid:4) 1019 m
et al. [165] did not quantify the absolute density of N2(v), he
investigated N2 vibrational loading and relaxation kinetics in non-
equilibrium N2 and air discharge using Picosecond coherent anti-
Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS) to measure rotational/trans-
temperature. Approximately 50% of
lational and vibrational
coupled discharge power goes to the vibrational mode of nitrogen
through electron impact excitation. More details on CARS will be
discussed in Section 5.4.2.

5.3. Measurements of active radicals by laser induced fluorescence
method

Active radicals such as O, H, and OH play an important role in
plasma assisted combustion. Detection of active radicals in PAC has
been conducted by using single and two photon laser induced
fluorescence methods. The laser induced fluorescence method is an
inelastic process in which photons are absorbed by the molecules
or atoms and then re-emitted at the same or different wavelengths.
The absorbed photons excite molecules or atoms to an energy level
above the ground state, and then photons are released during the
de-excitation process and can be detected. If only one photon is
absorbed to generate excitation, it is generally called Laser Induced
Fluorescence (LIF). If two photons are absorbed in order to excite
the species to a higher energy level, it is called Two photon Ab-
sorption Laser Induced Fluorescence (TALIF).

5.3.1. OH measurement by OH PLIF method

The OH PLIF technique has been widely used to quantify the OH
concentrations. If one photon is absorbed by the OH molecules,
fluorescence occurs during the de-excitation process. The fluores-
cence signal, SF, can be expressed as [279].

Sf

(5.8)

where h represents the overall efficiency of the optical setup in
collecting fluorescence photons, Vc is the collection volume, nOH is
the OH number density, fB is the Boltzmann factor for OH molecules
in the absorbing state, B12 is the Einstein absorption coefficient, E is
the laser energy, and fJ is the fluorescence quantum efficiency.
Since h and Vc are not well-defined parameters, calibration by a
known concentration of the species in the combustion system is
required to quantify the OH measurement.

Choi et al. [280] studied the OH radical kinetics in repetitively
pulsed H2/air nanosecond plasmas at P 1⁄4 54e94 Torr and initial
temperature of T 1⁄4 100 (cid:3)Ce200 (cid:3)C, equivalence F 1⁄4 1.0 at a flow
velocity of 0.5 m/s employing a plasma activated quartz reactor
[250]. A UV laser beam at 283 nm was used to excite the
A2Sþ ) X2P(1,0) electronic transition, followed by fluorescence
detection in the A2Sþ / X2P(1,1) band centered at ~315 nm. OH LIF
data obtained from the plasma experiment were put on an absolute
scale after calibrating with an atmospheric-pressure near-adiabatic
C2H4/air flameeflame Hencken burner. It is noteworthy that the
correction for differences in the collisional quenching and vibra-
tional energy transfer (VET) rates, which accounts for the change of
the fluorescence quantum efficiency (fJ), was considered in detail
in Ref. [280] for the calibration of absolute OH number density. It
was pointed out that the ratio of the VET rate to the quenching rate

was greater in the low pressure plasma discharge cell than in the
atmospheric pressure Hencken burner.

Through OH PLIF measurement, Choi et al. [280] found that the
typical value of OH number density after a single discharge pulse

was on the order of 1012 cm
OH number density increased rapidly during the initial ~0.1 ms
after the discharge initiation and decayed relatively slowly, with a
characteristic time scale of ~1 ms. In a repetitive burst mode, the
absolute OH number density was observed to rise rapidly during
the first approximately 10 pulses and then level off to a nearly
steady-state plateau. After approximately 5e10 ms,
ignition
happened accompanying a sharp rise in OH number density.

OH measurements have also been conducted in plasma assisted

ignition, stabilization, and flame extinction [56,144,147,249].

5.3.2. Atomic O and H measurement by TALIF method

The Two photon Absorption Laser Induced Fluorescence (TALIF)
method, calibrated with Xenon, was used to measure the absolute
atomic O concentration produced by the discharge. Ground state
atomic O is excited by absorbing two photons at a wavelength of
225.7 nm. The transition between the excited 3p 3P state and the 3s
3S state releases a single photon at 844.6 nm. Xenon can be excited
from 5p6 1S0 to 6p0[3/2]2 with two photons at 224.31 nm; de-
excitation to 6s0 [1/2]1 corresponds to fluorescence at 834.91 nm.
The number density of atomic O (NO) was calculated using the
following equation in terms of the known number density of Xenon
(NXe) [281],

where So and SXe are the observed fluorescence signals for O and
Xenon, respectively, a21 1⁄4 A21=A21 þ Q is the fluorescence quan-
tum yield (A21 and Q are the spontaneous emission and quenching
rates, respectively), s(2) is the two photon absorption cross sections
of Xe and O, FO(T) is the atomic O Boltzmann factor for the lower
level of the two photon absorption, ni represents the photon en-
ergies, and gND is the neutral density filter factor (neutral density
filter needs to be applied because the fluorescence from excited Xe
is orders of magnitude higher than the fluorescence from excited
atomic O). These values can be found or easily calculated based on
the data in Refs. [251,281].

A typical schematic of the TALIF system employed in Ref. [43] is
shown in Fig. 5.2. An Nd:YAG laser was used to generate 532 nm to
pump a tunable dye laser operating at ~573 nm. This 573 nm beam
was frequency doubled and mixed with the 1064 nm beam of the
Nd:YAG laser to get a ~226 nm beam of ~10 mJ/pulse required for the
TALIF diagnostics. The UV beam was focused 30 mm ahead of the
probe volume to avoid saturation. The TALIF signal was focused by a
lens with a 300 mm focal length and observed through an 850 nm
bandpass filter of 40 nm FWHM using a photomultiplier. The
atomic O TALIF signal was then quantified by Xenon TALIF signal
[251,281]. The overall relative mole fraction uncertainty of the
TALIF measurement was approximately ±40%.

Yin et al. [282] measured the concentration of H in a Ar/O2/H2
nanosecond pulsed discharge in a point-to-point geometry at
40 Torr using TALIF. H 3d2D3/2,5/2 ) 1s2S1/2 line was excited by two
photons at 205.144 nm. Fluorescence at ~656 nm was measured
and calibrated by Kr. The calibration process is very similar to the
atomic O TALIF measurement discussed above but uses two pho-
tons excitation of Kr 5p0[3/2]2 ) 2p61S0 line at 204.194 nm. Peak
concentration of H during the discharge was reported to be
approximately 6 (cid:4) 1015 cm-3.

The interaction of light with particles is a function of species
concentrations, scattering cross-sections, and particle density
(temperature). Therefore, with known effective cross-sections,
particle density (temperature) can be derived from Eq. (5.11).
However, the values of C, I, U and l are not well-defined so cali-
bration is still required to extract the quantitative results. The cal-
ibrations are conducted by comparing the signals with that from
measurements with known composition, temperature and pres-
sure to remove the uncertainty from C, I, U and l.

In the study of Sun et al. [144], Raleigh scattering thermometry
was employed to measure the temperatures of the flame with and
without in situ plasma discharge in a counterflow burner. The flow
composition was calculated using OPPDIF [284] to calculate the
effective cross-sections. Only major species (He, O2, CH4, CO, CO2
and H2O) were considered during the calculation of effective cross-
sections and these values can be found in Ref. [285]. The Rayleigh
scattering measurement was conducted with an Nd:YAG laser at
532 nm and the signals were collected with an ICCD camera
(Princeton Instrument, PI-MAX) with a narrow band filter near
532 nm. A total of 1500 images were accumulated and averaged to
obtain a high signal to noise ratio. The maximum uncertainty of the
Rayleigh scattering temperature measurements is found to be
±80 K, depending on the measurement location. Fig. 5.3 shows the
temperature profiles measured by Rayleigh scattering and
compared with simulations with and without the in situ discharge
in a counterflow flow system in the work of Ref. [144].

5.4.2. Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) thermometry

CARS thermometry is a nonlinear optical technique involving a
four-wave mixing process. The detailed mechanism of rotational
CARS can be found in Ref. [286]. It can be used for high spatial and
temporal resolution measurement of temperature distributions in
flames and plasmas. Zuzeek et al. [287] conducted rotational

reactor used by Uddi et al. [160] in C2H4/air at stoichiometric and

were excited by a burst of high-voltage nanosecond pulses (peak

5.4. Temperature measurements

As one of the most accurate and convenient methods, the
thermocouple has been widely used for temperature measure-
ments in combustion research. However, in plasma assisted com-
bustion, due to the ionization of the working gas and unsteady
nature of the problem, temperature measurement becomes very
challenging. For example, the interaction between the strong
electric field and thermocouple makes direct temperature mea-
surement using a thermocouple fail. While special thermocouples
[144] coated with ceramics may still apply for steady state prob-
lems in weakly ionized environments, advanced thermometry is
needed for the diagnostic of plasma assisted combustion.

5.4.1. Planar Rayleigh scattering thermometry

Different from the LIF technique, the Rayleigh scattering tech-
nique relies upon the elastic scattering of light by particles much
smaller than the wavelength of light used to perform the mea-
surement. Since it is an elastic scattering process, there is no energy
exchange between the incident light and the target particles. Thus,
the scattered light is unshifted from its initial wavelength [279]. It is
important to note that the scattered light signal peaks in the plane
orthogonal to the incident light polarization orientation and
different particles have different scattering cross-sections for the
incident light. The differential scattering cross-section of a partic-
ular molecule or atom for Rayleigh scattering at 90(cid:3) to the incident
light is given by [283].

rate and a burst repetition rate of 10 Hz.

A schematic of the pure rotational CARS apparatus is shown in
Fig. 5.4. An Nd:YAG pumped broadband Ti:sapphire laser with a
center wavelength of approximately 780 nm and pulse duration of
approximately 15 ns is split into two ‘pump’ beams, with approxi-
mately 20 mJ each, and orthogonal linear polarizations. The second
harmonic output (532 nm) of a second Nd:YAG laser, with 10 ns
pulse duration, is used to generate a horizontally polarized ‘probe’
beam. The pump and probe beams are overlapped in a focused
planar phase matching geometry, using a 400 mm focal distance
lens. The overlapped focused beams, which propagate parallel to
the major axis of the electrodes, form an approximately cylindri-
cally shaped measurement region ~0.1 mm in diameter and
1e2 mm long in the plasma. The pure rotational CARS signal beam
is generated with vertical polarization, which allows for very sig-
nificant (more than a factor of 1000) discrimination from stray,
horizontally polarized, probe light using a right angle polarizer. The

Inference of rotational temperature is performed using the
Sandia National Laboratories CARS code [288]. Fig. 5.5 shows the
square root of the experimental ethyleneeair CARS spectrum along
with the best fit synthetic spectrum generated by the Sandia CARS
code. While there are some statistical fluctuations that can be seen
from the imperfect agreement between the experimental spectrum
and best least squares fit, the overall rotational envelop is well
reproduced, resulting in an inferred best fit rotational temperature
of 860 K with uncertainty ±80e100 K. Compared to the spatially
averaged rotational temperatures inferred from emission spec-
troscopy, especially under conditions where heat transfer clearly
affects the temperature and may result in significant temperature
gradient across the plasma, CARS measurement provides high
spatial resolution measurement of temperature to clarify the effect
of temperature gradient.

5.4.3. NO laser induced fluorescence (LIF) thermometry

Nitric oxide (NO) can be produced from the plasma discharge
and as a trace gas naturally for temperature measurement using NO
Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) thermometry. The NO LIF ther-
mometry is based on a temperature dependent population of
rotational and vibrational energy levels of NO molecules [289]. Sun
et al. [43] implemented NO thermometry in a plasma assisted
combustion system to measure the flow temperature at the
downstream of plasma discharge and used NO thermometry to
verify thermocouple temperature measurement. During the ex-
periments, the laser beam was focused at the targeting position and
scanned over a part of the NO absorption band from 226.25 nm to
226.29 nm which is most sensitive to the temperature range of
interest. A PMT was used to collect the fluorescence and compared
with modeling [290,291]. The measurements were conducted at
the top burner exit as shown in Fig 4.16 at 60 Torr without the
presence of flame. NO was doped into the Ar/O2 plasma and Fig. 5.6
shows a typical NO fluorescence spectrum from experiment
normalized by laser intensity with discharge frequency 4 kHz and

for small hydrocarbons to address fuel oxidation kinetics at low
temperature [294]. Lefkowitz et al. [294] conducted in situ mid-IR
laser absorption spectroscopy of C2H4/Ar pyrolysis and C2H4/O2/
Ar oxidation activated by a nanosecond repetitively pulsed plasma
in a low temperature flow reactor at a pressure 60 Torr (see Fig. 4.7).
The implementation of mid-IR laser absorption spectroscopy in
non-equilibrium, low temperature plasma is challenging owing to
the small dimensional restraints required to sustain uniform
plasma. To overcome this challenge, Lefkowitz et al. [294] devel-
oped a miniature Herriott cell integrated with the flow reactor to
lengthen the path length in the plasma region. The Herriott cell is
comprised of two opposed 12.7 mm OD, 50 mm focal length
concave mirrors, which are centered 30 mm downstream of the
leading edge of the electrodes. The laser beam enters a 2 mm hole
in one of the mirrors and exits through the same hole after 24
passes through the plasma test section, resulting in a total ab-
sorption path length in the plasma of 1.08 m. An external cavity
quantum cascade laser operating in the 7e7.8 mm (mid-IR) range
was used to measure temperature, H2O, CH4, and C2H2 during and
after the activation of plasma discharge using the direct laser ab-
sorption spectroscopy technique.

In Ref. [294], all speciation measurements were quantified using
direct absorption. This experiment provided in situ diagnostic data
of intermediate hydrocarbon species in low temperature plasma
activated fuel pyrolysis and oxidation for the first time. By changing
(cid:2)1, CH2O formation in PAC can also
the laser wavelength to 2831 cm
be measured. This is an on-going experiment at PU by the authors.

5.5.3. Faraday rotation spectroscopy for HO2 measurement

As discussed in Section 4.2, HO2 is an important species for low
temperature fuel oxidation. HO2 can be formed through reaction R7
at low temperature conditions owing to the H production from
plasma. Brumfield et al. [167,293] demonstrated a mid-infrared
Faraday rotation spectroscopy (FRS) to in situ quantify HO2 for-
mation directly at atmospheric pressure in a flow reactor with He/
O2/DME as a working gas. In contrast to the optical absorption
methods, FRS is a dispersion based magneto-optical technique that
is selective only to paramagnetic radical species. Therefore, signals
from diamagnetic molecules, such as H2O, are suppressed, which
significantly mitigates the spectral interference.

In the work of Brumfield et al. [167,293], a longitudinal magnetic
field is applied to the exit of the flow reactor. This induces magnetic
circular birefringence for spectral transitions belonging to the
paramagnetic species, resulting in the Faraday effect. The amount of
polarization rotation depends on the strength of the applied
magnetic field, the intensity of the optical transitions, and the
number density of the paramagnetic species. Linearly-polarized
laser light from an external cavity quantum cascade laser with a
well-defined polarization axis is passed through the sample located
within a longitudinal magnetic field. Tunable light for probing the
HO2 Q-branch transitions in the n2 bending fundamental around
(cid:2)1 (7.1 mm) is used. The polarization rotation of the
1400 cm
transmitted light is transformed into intensity variations using a
polarizer (polarization analyzer). The FRS signal encoded in the
light intensity can then be measured with a photodetector. The
signal can then be modeled by taking into account system pa-
rameters to calculate the laser frequency dependent RMS signal
voltage (VRMS) at the output of the detector:

VRMSð~nÞ 1⁄4 GP0 sin 2 qQRMSð~nÞ

(5.13)

where G is an experimental factor that combines the transmission
through the wire grid polarizers, the detector gain, and the optical
collection efficiency at the detector. The optical power incident on
the wire grid polarizer is given by P0, and the polarization analyzer

modeling at different temperature. The thermocouple reading of
the temperature was 387 K and the best fit of the spectrum was
397 K.

Recently, Watson et al. [292] measured one-dimensional flame
temperature profile using NO thermometry with a different scan
range from 225.13 to 225.19 nm in order to maximize the tem-
perature sensitivity in a broad range from cold flow to burned gas.
More details can be found in Ref. [292].

5.5. Measurement of intermediate species

5.5.1. CH2O measurement by CH2O PLIF method

A typical feature of plasma assisted combustion is low temper-
ature combustion. As discussed in Ref. [107], low temperature
combustion, including cool flame behavior, cannot be characterized
by OH. CH2O, however, is an excellent marker of low temperature
combustion chemistry [107,293].

CH2O molecule has several absorption bands suitable for laser
excitation in the wavelength regime from 270 to 360 nm [252]. The
third harmonic of a conventional Nd:YAG laser can be used for
excitation of CH2O. The main drawback of this alternative is that the
laser line is overlapping with relatively weak rotational transitions
of the molecules. However, the main advantage is that a standard
Nd:YAG laser system can be used with high pulse energy available
at 355 nm.

1

Sun et al. [107] employed CH2O PLIF [252,253] excited by pho-
tons at 355 nm from the third harmonic from the Nd:YAG laser to
study the plasma activated low temperature chemistry in a DME/
~
A1A2 to
He/O2 diffusion flame. The fluorescence signal from the
~
A1 transition band is collected by the ICCD camera with a
X
bandpass filter from 400 to 450 nm. As discussed in Section 4.3, the
CH2O PLIF signal was successfully obtained and used as DME low
temperature chemistry marker. However, the quantification of the
CH2O LIF signal
is very challenging because the unknown
quenching rates from different species. In addition, temperature
and pressure were also found to have a quenching effect on the
fluorescence [253]. For quantitative measurements, mid-IR laser
absorption and molecular beam mass spectrometry are the alter-
native methods [294].

5.5.2. Measurement of H2O, CH4, CH2O and C2H2 by mid-IR
absorption method

The advantage of mid-IR laser absorption spectroscopy is its
ability to make quantitative, sensitive (sub-ppm level), time-
dependent measurements of multiple species and temperatures

offset angle is given by q. QRMSð~nÞ is the root mean square value for
the Faraday rotation angle as a function of optical frequency. The
QRMS spectrum is calculated for individual HO2 transitions at
discrete frequency points over the spectral window by numerically
calculating the first Fourier component at the magnetic field
modulation frequency. The model used for spectral fitting requires
the following input parameters: the RMS value of the magnetic
field, the temperature of the gas sample in the reactor exit, and the
optical path length. Four parameters in the model were used as
variables: the HO2 number density ðnHO2
Þ, the collision broadened
line width (D~nHWHM), a signal offset, and a frequency offset. The
signal and frequency offsets have been implemented to account for
systematic errors due to electromagnetic interference (EMI) from
the Helmholtz coils and an offset of the wavemeter frequency
reading respectively. D~nHWHM is a fitted parameter because the
collisional broadening for HO2 is unknown for gas mixtures
composed of 90% He and 10% O2 at 1 atm pressure. A non-linear
least squares fitting algorithm has been implemented to find the
best fit and determine the HO2 number density ðnHO2
Þ in the
sample. With FRS technique, Brumfield et al. [166] demonstrated
HO2 quantification at atmospheric pressure in a combustion envi-
ronment for the first time. The results from both experiments and
modeling are shown in Fig. 5.7.

It is worth noting that quantification of absorption spectroscopy
and LIF requires the distribution in quantum state of species which
is typically Boltzmann. However, the non-equilibrium nature of
plasma poses significant challenges on the diagnostics with non-
Boltzmann distribution in quantum state of species. This effect is
associated with the collisional energy transfer process which de-
pends on time, states, energy of particles, and pressure. Another
issue is the unknown cross-sections for plasma produced species
present in the flow. For example, the quantification of temperature
through Rayleigh scattering thermometry can be compromised.
Moreover, the measurement of electron number density and elec-
tric field over all electron energy range is also difficult. To the au-
thors' knowledge, these issues have not been well addressed in
detail.

6. Development of kinetic mechanisms and methods for
plasma combustion modeling

Modeling of plasma discharge in air and conventional com-
bustion has been widely addressed in other reviews and thus will

not be discussed here. The purpose of this section is to discuss the
recent efforts to model plasma assisted combustion. Because fuel
oxidation mechanism has not been emphasized in the plasma
modeling community and the fact that plasma kinetics is often
ignored in the combustion community, the major challenge of
modeling plasma assisted combustion is the lack of predictive
detailed kinetic mechanisms. The first step in an attempt to model
plasma assisted combustion is to combine the plasma kinetic
mechanisms (e.g. air plasma) with existing combustion kinetic
mechanisms by adding a few well-known interactions between
plasma generated species and the combustion kinetic mechanism.
Therefore, there may exist many missing reaction pathways and
intermediate species. Moreover, due to the limited data available in
well-defined experimental conditions, the developed mechanisms
for plasma assisted combustion often lack comprehensive valida-
tions with different experimental methods under broad pressure
and temperature conditions. In this section, we will discuss a few
recent efforts to develop validated plasma assisted combustion
mechanisms.

6.1. Coupling plasma mechanisms with combustion mechanisms

Adamovich et al. [194] developed a kinetic model by combining
an air plasma model [295] with a high temperature hydrocarbon
oxidation mechanism (GRI Mech 3.0 [240] or USC Mech II [241]) to
model CH4/air and C2H4/air plasmas. This combined kinetic model
is supplemented by CH4, C2H4, and C2H2 dissociation reactions by
the direct electron impact and the collisions with electronically
excited N2. The model was further extended by Sun et al. [106] to
include other dilution gases such as He and Ar. For example, in
order to consider species dissociation by reactions with excited Ar
and He, and dissociation of CH4 by electron impact reactions,
additional elementary reactions involving the dilution gases (He/
Ar), fuel, oxygen are required in the kinetic model. Table 4 [106]
presents the reactions describing the interactions between

plasma kinetics and fuel oxidation kinetics. The kinetic models also
incorporated chemical reactions of electronically excited species,
electron-ion recombination reactions, ioneion neutralization pro-
ionemolecule collisional energy transfer reactions, and
cesses,
electron attachment and detachment processes.

The rate coefficients of electron impact ionization, dissociation,
and electronic excitation as well as the electron energy distribution
function (EEDF) are normally calculated by using a Boltzmann
equation solver (such as BOLSIG [299]) with the input of electron
impact cross-sections. Similar plasma assisted combustion kinetic
models containing H2, CH4 to C5H12 were developed by Aleksan-
drov et al. [246] and Starikovskaia et al. [239]. Since no reliable
cross-section data are available for large hydrocarbons such as
C3H8, C4H10 and C5H12, the authors assumed that these cross-
sections are similar to those for C2H6. Among these kinetic
models, the H2/air plasma model [239] is a detailed state-to-state
kinetic model including 750 chemical and 8700 vibrational en-
ergy exchange processes with 254 species. To the authors' knowl-
edge, the most updated electron impact cross section data have
been documented, respectively, in references for O2 [300], N2 [301],
H2 [302], CO [303], CO2 [304], H2O [305], and simple hydrocarbon
molecules (CH4, C2H6, C2H4, C2H2, C3H8, C3H6 [306], and n-C4H10
[307] (only for ionization).

Uddi et al. [160] showed that the kinetic model predictions
using the model developed by Adamovich et al. [194] were in good
overall agreement with the experimental data for TALIF O mea-
surements. However, the overall agreement might be partly due to
the “lucky or magic choice” of the E/N ratio. In addition, for the fuel
oxidation products, different combustion kinetic models had very
different predictions and the results differ by almost one order of
magnitude as shown in Fig. 6.1. Since the same set of plasma re-
actions and rates were used in both cases, the difference between
the two kinetic models was from the difference between the re-
actions and rates used by GRI Mech 3.0 [240] and USC Mech II [241].
Note that both GRI Mech and USC Mech were developed for the
purpose of high temperature combustion. As pointed out by Sun
et al. [106], fuel oxidation kinetic mechanisms have rarely been
validated at low temperature conditions. Figs. 4.6 and 4.7 show
clearly that there exist many low temperature fuel oxidation
pathways which are missing in GRI and USC Mech. In addition, the
predicted low temperature species concentrations (H2O and CH4)

differ by even one order. Therefore, there are large uncertainties in
existing plasma combustion mechanisms at low temperature and
high pressure conditions, especially for large molecule liquid fuels.

6.2. Recent developments of plasma mechanisms

To extend the validity of combustion modeling to high pressure
and lower temperature conditions, a collaborative effort to develop
a comprehensive high pressure plasma combustion mechanism
(HP-Mech/plasma) for small hydrocarbon including (H2/H2O2/O3/
CO/CH2O/CH3OH) has been carried out by the team members of the
AFOSR multi-university research initiative on plasma assisted
combustion (MURI-plasma) at Penn State, Princeton, and Ohio
State. The approach is to take the advantage of the recent devel-
opment of a high pressure hydrogen mechanism [308], formalde-
hyde and methanol mechanism [309], formaldehyde and acetylene
mechanism [242], O3 decomposition rate [310], and NOx mecha-
nism [311]. Reactions of O(1D) with fuels/N2/O2/CO/CO2/H2O/CH2O
and O2 singlet with fuels/H/OH/CH3/H2/CH4 are updated using the
best estimates of the energy barriers and rate constants. Low
temperature fuel oxidation pathways including RO2 and aldehyde
formation are also added using similarity rules [312,313]. Fig. 6.2
and Fig. 6.3 show the preliminary validation of the HP-Mech/
plasma for H2 and CO mixtures with NOx addition from low to
high pressures [314]. The results show that the new mechanism can
well reproduce the experimental data in the variable pressure flow
reactor [209]. Fig. 6.3 also shows the comparison of predicted flame
speeds of O3 addition in methane/air mixture. It is seen that the
new model has better agreement with the experimental data than
the previous model. The current HP-Mech/plasma is still in a pre-
liminary version. Comprehensive validations and improvement in
the future are needed.

In recent years, another great effort has been made on the
development of the kinetic mechanisms of excited molecules for
plasma assisted combustion. Among different electronically excited

fuel lean conditions but only a minor effect was identified with the
stoichiometric mixture. At T0 1⁄4 450 K, converting 10% of O2 into
1Dg) can increase flame speed by approximately 70% for the
O2(a
mixture with F 1⁄4 0.45 and only ~20% for the stoichiometric
mixture. For the fuel rich mixture (F 1⁄4 1.9), the flame speed
increased by ~40%. At T0 1⁄4 300 K, the increase in the flame speed
was even smaller: for stoichiometric and fuel rich (F 1⁄4 1.6) mix-
tures, the increase was about 17%. The authors explained that the
main reason of the flame speed increase is the acceleration of chain
1Dg) molecules in the
branching due to the abundance of O2(a
1Dg) molecules in the mixture
mixtures. The abundance of O2(a
causes an increase in the rates of all reactions resulting in the

formation of highly reactive atoms and radicals responsible for the
chain branching development.

6.3. Plasma assisted combustion modeling

Numerical modeling can provide valuable insights in the un-
derstanding of plasma assisted combustion. However, one difficulty
in the modeling of plasma assisted combustion is the scarcity of
experimental data to validate numerical modeling. Another

fragments, experimental data play a critical role in

Typical detailed modeling methods for nanosecond pulsed
plasma assisted combustion are the zero-dimensional model [160]
and the one-dimensional model [316]. Details about the physical
model can be found in Refs. [316,317]. Only the technical challenges
will be discussed here. The zero-dimensional model does not solve
the Poisson equation and charge motion and therefore does not
resolve the sheath formation and charge drifting and diffusion
which determine the intensity of electric field (E) in the bulk
plasma region. In the work of Uddi et al. [160], E was adjusted as a
parameter in the zero-dimensional model until the peak atomic O
concentration matched with the experimental value. Then, the
decay of atomic O from experiments and modeling results were
studied. Nagaraja et al.
[316] conducted time accurate one-
dimensional modeling of the nanosecond pulsed discharge in H2/
air mixture. The modeling results showed good agreement with
experimentally measured OH concentrations before ignitions and
the ignition delay time. Compared to the zero-dimensional
modeling, one-dimensional modeling is still computationally very
expensive due to the multi-time scale nature of plasma assisted
combustion and special/temporal resolution. It is worth noting that
in the one-dimensional and high dimensional models, to improve
the computation efficiency, EEDF is often solved beforehand and
tabulated for the rest of calculation. Therefore, the effect of flow
composition change on EEDF will not be appropriately considered.

7. Technical challenges and future research

Plasma assisted combustion provides numerous opportunities
in both engineering applications and in scientific research. At the
same time, plasma assisted combustion is a very complicated sys-
tem coupling plasma kinetics, combustion kinetics, and flame and
fluid dynamics. As such, there are still many knowledge gaps from
discharge development to fundamental understanding and nu-
merical modeling capabilities.

For plasma assisted combustion in internal combustion engines,
the development of a large volume discharge of a size greater than
the critical flame radius at high pressure is very important. Unfor-
tunately, although many studies have shown that microwave,
gliding arc, and short pulsed repetitive discharge enhanced engine
performance, the observed enhancement was often limited to low
engine pressures. In addition, the discharge device is expensive and
produces serious electrical noise. To improve the ignition control in
advanced HCCI, PPCI, and RCCI engines, one of the major challenges
for plasma assisted combustion is to develop a plasma discharge
which can produce large volume discharge at high pressure.

Moreover, the increasingly stringent low NOx emission stan-
dards as well as the requirement of fuel flexibility and higher effi-
ciency in power generation also create a great opportunity for
plasma assisted combustion to enhance flame stabilization in ultra-
lean and low temperature combustion. For example, the combi-
nation of a microtube gas turbine combustor with non-equilibrium
plasma may have a great potential to solve the problems both in
flame flashback and lean blow-off. In addition, the combination of
microwave with gliding arc and/or short pulse repetitive discharge
has the potential to stabilize ultra-lean gas turbine combustion of
fuels with large variation in heating values. It is worth noting that
plasma assisted low temperature combustion can reduce NOx for-
mation. However, at the same time, plasma also produces NOx (this
effect may be significant at high pressure condition) depending on
the mixture and combustion environment. The key challenge here
is to develop methods to design efficient high pressure micro-
discharge with minimized NOx emissions. Furthermore, plasma is
a promising technique to extend the flight envelope of gas turbine

difficulty is that plasma assisted combustion modeling often ex-
periences large gradients of temperature and species concentra-
tions, which significantly affect the EEDF and therefore the rate
constants of electron impact reactions. Since there are large
amounts of missing reaction pathways such as electron impact
reactions of different fuels, the reactions between excited species,

afterburner relight. A large volume ignition by non-equilibrium
plasma is able to avoid the failure of afterburner relight at very
low pressure. As shown in Section 2, for unmanned aerial vehicles,
plasma assisted combustion can effectively extend the engine limit
burn limit. In scramjet combustion, non-equilibrium plasma also
provides good opportunities from selective fuel reforming of
endothermic fuels to ignition and combustion enhancement.
However, the key issue is the large energy consumption of plasma
in a high speed flow and the main challenge is how to produce a
discharge at the interface of fuel air mixing away from the engine
walls. Many filament discharges only occur near the electrodes. In
addition, the introduction of plasma may complicate the system
and the optimized location for plasma generator may not be real-
ized owing to the challenge of engineering design.

The observation of plasma activated low temperature combus-
tion and cool flames suggests that non-equilibrium plasma is an
effective technique for fuel processing and emission control. With
today's slow progress in cellulosic biofuel production, heavy fuel
residue processing, and fuel production from waste materials, non-
equilibrium plasma is certainly an attractive approach to improve
the fuel conversion efficiency. For example, the plasma generated
cool flames and low temperature oxidation can be used for in situ
fuel processing, reforming, and producing valuable chemicals from
heavy fuels, waste plastic materials, and cokes. However, the major
challenge is that we still do not know what the best plasma
discharge is for each of these applications.

In research, despite the significant advancement in the last few
years, many of the underlying plasma/combustion interaction
mechanisms remain unknown. For example, the energy coupling
between different electronic, vibrational, and rotation excitations
has not been well understood. There are many missing reaction
pathways in plasma assisted combustion. The existing plasma
mechanisms have not been extensively validated in practical
application conditions. Experimental data and cross-sectional areas
for large hydrocarbon fuels are scarce. There are large uncertainties
in ab initio quantum chemistry computation for reaction rate con-
stants involving excited species and electrons. Accurate modeling
of plasma assisted combustion even in one dimension is still
challenging. In order to address these challenges, future efforts on
experimental methods, kinetic mechanism development, numeri-
cal modeling, and diagnostics are needed.

In experimental study, the challenge is how to design funda-
mental experiments which have well understood flow and
boundary conditions and are easier to model from both combustion
and plasma point of views. Most of the studies of plasma assisted
combustion in the past have described plasma as a “magic black
box” which enhanced combustion significantly but with compli-
cated coupling between flow, combustion, and plasma. In order to
advance the understanding and the validation for modeling of
plasma assisted combustion, quantitative results such as electric
field, electron temperature, and species distribution need to be
measured directly or extracted from the experiments. Therefore, it
is extremely important to design well-defined experimental plat-
forms to produce high quality quantitative data, especially at high
pressure.

Flow reactors, shock tube, rapid combustion, jet stirred reactors,
and counterflow flame systems are good examples of well-defined
combustion systems. However, the development of well-defined
(e.g., uniform) plasma discharge in these experimental systems is
challenging, especially at high pressure. Moreover, in situ optical
diagnostics is also critical to understand the kinetic processes of
plasma discharge and fuel oxidation. Many of the previous studies
have focused on the measurements of small radicals (e.g., H, O, and
OH). However, measurements of intermediate species such as
CH2O, H2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, HO2, and H2O2 are equally important to

Physics and Technology, EP: Ecole Polytechnique).

understand the chemistry and reaction pathways. Mid-infrared
laser diagnostics has provided unprecedented opportunities for
detecting these intermediate species.

As discussed in this paper, the kinetic enhancement of non-
equilibrium plasma on combustion is more significant at low
temperature conditions. However, few experimental data sets are
available at low temperatures. As such, the validity of current
plasma assisted combustion kinetic models at low temperature
conditions is still in question. New combustion kinetic models
validated at low temperature conditions are needed for further
numerical investigation. Furthermore, due to the multi-time scale
nature of plasma assisted combustion systems, time history mea-
surement of intermediate species is also very important.

Most practical engine applications are at high pressures. Fig. 7.1
summarizes the experimental conditions of fundamental research
conducted in plasma assisted combustion. It is seen that current
research has only been carried at lower pressures rather than at
high pressure gas turbine and IC engine conditions. Although some

78

rapid compression machine studies have extended the experiment
to higher pressure, the discharge is not uniform and it is difficult to
understand the fundamental kinetics. Unfortunately, high pressure
causes thermal instability and local collisional thermalization of
plasma. Therefore, developing experimental methods to generate
stable, uniform non-equilibrium plasma under practical combustor
pressure conditions is a challenging question for fundamental
research. This challenge is not only open to the combustion society
but also to the plasma research society.

Understanding the energy transfer between different excited
energy modes is difficult. Due to the high excitation energy, plasma
can introduce many new reaction pathways between excited spe-
cies and through the collisions of excited species with neutral
molecules. In N2, He, and Ar plasma systems, the electronic exci-
tation energies are very high (above 5 eV for N2, and 10 eV for Ar
and He). As shown in Fig. 7.2, the excitation energy is much higher
than the chemical bond energy of most hydrocarbon fuels. Hence,
the excited species contain a significant amount of energy, and are
capable of dissociating a fuel molecule in a single collision. This
phenomenon can lead to drastic changes in the transport and
chemical properties of the combustible mixture. Energy transfer
involving vibrationally excited species such as N2(v), O2(v) and
HO2(v) is even more complicated. Unfortunately, few diagnostics of
electronically and vibrationally excited molecules have been made.
The studies of new reaction pathways involving energy transfer of
excited species in plasma assisted combustion require advanced
diagnostic techniques to quantitatively detect these species in situ.
Modeling of plasma assisted combustion is also difficult. Plasma
discharge is a multi-physical, multi-scale, and non-equilibrium
process. The characteristic time of plasma kinetics ranges from
sub-nanoseconds to milliseconds, which is vastly different from the
characteristic time of combustion kinetics. The non-equilibrium
and multi-time scale nature make the numerical modeling of
plasma assisted combustion extremely challenging. For example,
appropriate modeling of unsteady, multidimensional short pulse
discharge including the sheath effect is still difficult. Most of the
existing methods are based on the estimated E/N distribution and
the non-equilibrium Boltzmann solver without considering the
sheath effect and the coupling between electric field and charge
motion. An efficient and validated plasma modeling approach is
needed.

8. Conclusion

Significant advancements in plasma assisted combustion have
been made in both practical applications and fundamental under-
standing. New observations of plasma assisted ignition enhance-
ment, flame speed enhancement, ultra-lean combustion, cool
flames, flameless combustion, emission reduction, and low tem-
perature fuel reforming are reported in internal combustion en-
gines, gas turbines, turbulent flames, high speed propulsion
systems, and fuel processing. Several significant advances in un-
derstanding of non-thermal and thermal effects, kinetic pathways
of atomic oxygen production, diagnostics of electronically and
vibrationally excited species, plasma combustion kinetics of sub-
explosion limit ignition, plasma assisted low temperature com-
bustion, transitions of the classical ignition S-curve, dynamics of
the minimum ignition energy, and the transport effect by non-
equilibrium plasma discharge, have been made. These findings
and advances create many new opportunities in the development
of efficient plasma discharges for practical applications and in
future research. However, there are still large knowledge gaps in
both discharge development and fundamental understanding and
modeling capabilities. In engineering applications, development of
efficient plasma discharge for large volume ignition at high

pressure is the key to extend plasma assisted combustion in en-
gines. In research, understanding of the energy coupling between
different electronic, vibrational, and rotation excitations remain
challenging. The existing plasma mechanisms have not been
extensively validated in practical application conditions. There are
many missing reaction pathways in plasma assisted combustion.
Experimental data and cross-section areas for large hydrocarbon
fuels are scarce. Accurate modeling of plasma assisted combustion
even in one-dimensional is still difficult due to the multi-timescale
and non-equilibrium nature of plasma. In order to address these
challenges, future efforts on experiments, kinetic mechanism, nu-
merical modeling, and diagnostics are needed.
