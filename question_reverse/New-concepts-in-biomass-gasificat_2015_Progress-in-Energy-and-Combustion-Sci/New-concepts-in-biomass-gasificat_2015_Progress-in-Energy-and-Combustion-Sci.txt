Gasification is considered as a key technology for the use of biomass. In order to promote this technology
in the future, advanced, cost-effective, and highly efficient gasification processes and systems are
required. This paper provides a detailed review on new concepts in biomass gasification.

Concepts for process integration and combination aim to enable higher process efficiencies, better gas
quality and purity, and lower investment costs. The recently developed UNIQUE gasifier which integrates
gasification, gas cleaning and conditioning in one reactor unit is an example for a promising process
integration. Other interesting concepts combine pyrolysis and gasification or gasification and combustion
in single controlled stages. An approach to improve the economic viability and sustainability of the
utilization of biomass via gasification is the combined production of more than one product. Poly-
generation strategies for the production of multiple energy products from biomass gasification syngas
offer high efficiency and flexibility.

1. Introduction

Global warming and climate change concerns result in efforts to
reduce CO2 greenhouse gas emissions by increasing the use of
renewable energies and increasing the energy efficiency. Besides
solar and wind energy, biomass is considered as a main renewable
energy source. In the renewable energy mixture of solar, wind and
biomass energy, biomass can be used as adjustable, controlled
energy which will be supplied in increased amount when wind and
solar energy supply is low.

Since the discovery of the mankind how to make fire, biomass
has been the main energy source for thousands of years and still
today it contributes in the range of more than 10% to the world
energy supply and ranks as the fourth source of energy in the world
[1]. In rural agricultural areas, biomass is still the main energy
resource for heating and cooking and often it is the only available
energy source there. In developing countries in Asia and Africa
more than one-third of the total energy consumption is based on
biomass. A big advantage of biomass is that it is available at every
place all over the world which is in contrast to coal or natural gas.
For example, in India which has very large coal reserves of more
than 250 billion tons, the coal deposits are just located in the state
of Bihar and northeast. Transportation costs play a major role in the
distribution of the coal. Biomass in contrast is uniformly and widely
distributed over the country [2].

Gasification is a key technology for the use of biomass. It offers a
high flexibility in using different kind of feedstock materials as well
as in the generation of different products. In principal, all different
types of biomass can be converted by gasification into syngas
mainly comprising hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide
and methane. From this syngas, all kinds of energy or energy car-
riers e heat, power, biofuels, hydrogen, biomethane e as well as
chemicals can be provided. Synthesis of FischereTropsch (FT)
diesel, dimethyl ether (DME), methanol and methane are estab-
lished technical processes. The use of the available biomass re-
sources needs to be highly efficient and sustainable. Gasification
offers a high potential and a high process efficiency for the use of
biomass [3]. Gasification of biomass is performed by partial
oxidation of the carbon contained in the biomass at high temper-
ature using a controlled amount of an oxidant which can be air,
pure oxygen or steam. The composition and properties of the
syngas depend on the biomass feedstock, the gasifier type and the
operation conditions of the gasifier, such as the used oxidant, the
temperature and the residence time in the gasifier. Gasification
with air leads to a syngas with a heating value of 4e7 MJ/m3

whereas using pure oxygen or steam as an oxidant leads to
significantly higher heating values of the gas of 10e18 MJ/m3 [4,5].
Biomass comprises a broad range of different kinds of bio ma-
terials, such as wood, forest and agricultural residues, waste from
wood and food industry, algae, energy grasses, straw, bagasse,
sewage sludge etc. The use of different kinds of biomass results in
different challenges and solutions for transportation, storage and
feeding of the biomass, for operation of the gasifier and for cleaning
of the produced syngas. Most commonly used types of biomass
gasifiers are fixed bed and moving bed, fluidized bed and entrained
flow gasifiers. Fluidized bed and entrained flow gasifiers provide an
intensive contact between the gas and the solid biomass which
results in high reaction rates and conversion efficiencies. Fixed bed
gasifiers typically have a lower heat and mass transfer and often
generate higher amounts of tar and char. However, operation and
design of fixed bed gasifiers are simpler and they are preferably
used in small size. Performance data of the mentioned gasifier
types are given in Table 1.

Depending on the use of the syngas, its cleaning needs to be very
efficient. Catalytic synthesis reactions or the use in fuel cells for
examples require high purity of the syngas. Main impurities in the
syngas are fly ash particles and tar. Other impurities in the syngas
are typically sulphur compounds (e.g. H2S, COS), hydrogen chloride,
alkalines, and ammonia. Tar formation is a main problem in
biomass gasification. Tar condensation at lower temperatures can
cause clogging or blockage of pipes, filters, catalyst units or engines.
Tar formation also lowers the syngas yield and the heating value of
the gas. Tar removal has been the subject of many researches
leading to the development of primary and secondary measures for
tar reduction. Overviews on this topic are recently given e.g. by Han
and Kim [13], by Aravind and de Jong [14] and by Shen and Yosh-
ikawa [15].

In order to promote the utilization of biomass gasification,
advanced concepts are required which have to maximize the syn-
gas yield, optimize the gas quality, increase the gas purity, increase
the overall process efficiency and improve the economic viability
by decreasing system and production costs.

This paper aims to provide a detailed review on such new
concepts in biomass gasification. Process integration and combi-
nation, polygeneration strategies as well as new gasification con-
cepts are presented as follows (see also Table 2):

developed UNIQUE gasifier concept which integrates gasifica-
tion, gas cleaning and conditioning in one reactor unit. This

(cid:2) New advanced multi-stage gasification concepts separate and

This enables to achieve high process efficiencies and a syngas

the process is increased by combining different reactors.

tion of the slurries and production of biofuels in a large

well as biofuel production becomes more economical.

heat and power production as well as hydrogen and heat pro-
duction attract increasing interest.

(cid:2) New gasification concepts, such as plasma and supercritical
water gasification, provide interesting advantages for special
kinds of biomass.

2. Advanced process integration and combination concepts

2.1. Compact UNIQUE reactor concept e integrated gasification, gas
cleaning and conditioning

In existing gasification plants, abatement of particulate (char, fly
ash) and tar (high molecular weight hydrocarbons) content of the
raw syngas is normally done by filtration and scrubbing: in this way
the clean fuel gas is made available at temperatures close to
ambient, and the most immediate option for power generation is
gas engine. Such process configuration does not allow high electric
conversion efficiencies: reported values are close to 25% [16], that is
what is also obtainable with modern combustion plants coupled
with steam turbines. This penalizes notably the overall economic
balance of the plant, which would benefit of a higher share of
electricity against heat production, due also to the incentives for
green electricity offered in most countries. In addition, tar separa-
tion is sometimes not as effective as it should be, reduces the gas
yield, and generates waste streams difficult to dispose or recycle
properly.

High temperature gas cleaning and catalytic conditioning is
the focal point to promote more efficient industrial applications
of biomass gasification for energy and chemicals: gas treat-
ments should be strictly integrated with biomass conversion
and carried out at a close temperature range, to preserve the
thermal energy content of the biomass gas. This is even more
true in the case of steam gasification and its coupling with a
high temperature fuel cell or downstream catalytic processes,
to avoid loss by condensation of the significant amount of
water vapour contained in the gas stream, useful to reform
CH4, shift CO towards H2 and prevent carbon deposition on the
catalytic surfaces.

The application of such fundamental process integration con-
cepts not only allows to realize more simple, efficient and cost
effective gasification plants, but offers the opportunity to overcome
some major obstacles still preventing a large market diffusion of
such technologies, specifically at the small to medium scales (less
than 10 MWth) amenable to vast economic contexts of developed
and developing countries. It needs to be stressed that the integra-
tion of a biomass steam gasifier with a high temperature fuel cell
(more specifically, a solid oxide fuel cell) appears most suitable to
realize very efficient bio-energy systems at relatively small scale. It
is almost universally recognized that power generation by means of
a fuel cell can compete in terms of efficiency with large IGCC in-
stallations; high temperature fuel cells are able to utilize the major
fuel species obtained from the biomass gasification process (H2, CO,
CH4). Although they are much more resistant to contaminants than
low temperature fuel cells, provision should be made however to
drastically reduce the fuel gas content of alkali and sour gas
compounds.

Recent developments in innovative catalysts, sorbents and high
temperature filtration media offer the opportunity to integrate in
one reactor biomass gasification and gas cleaning and conditioning
processes needed to obtain a clean fuel gas from biomass that
would allow immediate and efficient conversion into power (high
temperature fuel cells; micro gas turbines; combined, strictly in-
tegrated heat and power plant schemes) and further catalytic gas
processing addressed to second generation bio-fuels (liquid fuels,
hydrogen) and chemicals, allowing to implement diversified poly-
generation strategies.

The UNIQUE gasification technology, developed by means of
joint R&D efforts by several research organizations and private
companies throughout Europe, did provide the opportunity to
develop technical innovations addressed to existing and new in-
dustrial installations. Their effectiveness was tested at real indus-
trial conditions, over a significant range of scales, from lab facilities
to output slip streams of industrial gasifiers. Both authors of this
paper are directly connected to the developments of the so called
UNIQUE gasifier: although such a circumstance may well explain
why it is described in some details within this survey about inno-
vative biomass gasification concepts, it should be mentioned here
that additional, complementary reviews stress in their conclusions
the potential of hot gas cleaning for efficient tar reforming, espe-
cially since the particulate filter combined with a catalyst can be a
key component of the gasifier itself [17].

2.1.1. The UNIQUE gasifier concept

This new concept for a compact integration of biomass gasifi-
cation and hot syngas cleaning and conditioning systems was
originally outlined in patents [18,19], deeply investigated in its
different technical aspects by means of a collaborative R&D Euro-
pean project [20] and applied in further developments [21] and
industrial testing campaigns.

Catalytic filter elements for particle and tar removal (see e.g.
Refs. [22,23]) are directly integrated into the freeboard of a fluid-
ized bed steam gasifier. Fig. 1 shows schematically the principle of
this new gas cleaning concept. Remarkable system simplification is
achieved by housing the whole gas conditioning system in the
gasifier, reducing thermal losses, equipment and plant space, and
allowing for a very compact unit: the activity of catalysts and sor-
bents is increased, while keeping high the thermal efficiency of the
whole conversion process as no cooling step is included, and
avoiding particle entrainment in the product gas at the reactor
outlet. As a result, some major advantages of traditional primary
and secondary hot gas treatments are combined together, without
their well-known respective drawbacks (catalyst clogging by solid
particles, loss of gas chemical and thermal energy, etc.).

Fig. 1. The UNIQUE concept for integration of gasification with hot gas cleaning and
conditioning in one reactor vessel [20].

As a result, this arrangement (integration of catalytic filtration
and biomass gasification in one reactor vessel) allows for the con-
version of tar, elimination of trace elements and an efficient
abatement of the particulate, delivering high purity syngas, suitable
to assure a high share of power generation even in small- to
medium-scale (few MWth) combined heat and power production
and power plants, and to increase the overall economic revenue.
The UNIQUE concept for hot gas cleaning and conditioning provides
a concrete contribution to the target of reducing the cost of elec-
tricity obtained by means of advanced biomass energy systems.

2.1.2.

In bed primary catalytic reduction of tar

As it is well known, the main problems to improve industrial
viability of biomass gasification processes are related to the pres-
ence of tar in the product gas. Steam reforming of high molecular
weight hydrocarbons is considered the most appropriate way for
their elimination [24], however chemical kinetics of the gaseous
phase homogeneous reactions are satisfactory at high tempera-
tures, above 1200 (cid:3)C, due to high activation energies, in most cases
greater than 250e350 kJ/mol. With the use of catalysts, steam and
dry reforming reactions become an effective way to remove tar
components from the fuel gas at lower temperatures, compatible
with those adopted in gasification processes.

One of the most important advantages of a fluidized bed gasifier
is given by the possibility to utilize a low cost mineral bed material
catalytically active for such reactions, in presence of steam as a
gasification agent [25,26]. The catalyst to be utilized should be at
the same time efficient in the reforming of hydrocarbons, has high
selectivity for syngas, and high resistance for attrition and carbon
formation. It should also satisfy the requirement of relatively low
cost, because the formation of ash and char obliges to discharge
used material and reintegrate the bed inventory continuously with
a fresh/regenerated charge. A detailed analysis of the performance
of primary tar removal catalysts applied at lab to industrial scale is
beyond the scope of this work; a comprehensive review of the
primary measures (including gasification conditions and gasifier
design in addition to bed additives) for tar elimination in biomass
gasification processes has been published by Devi and co-authors
[27], and a more general and recent examination of different stra-
tegies for tar reduction in the biomass product gas via mechanical,
catalytic and thermal methods [28] also provides quantitative and
comparative figures about catalytic hot gas conditioning performed
within the gasifier bed itself.

A large number of investigations deals with dolomite, (Ca,Mg)
CO3, or olivine, (Mg,Fe)2SiO4. Calcined dolomite,
limestone or
magnesite have been found able to increase the gas hydrogen
content [29e33]. Olivine shows a slightly lower activity in biomass
gasification and tar reforming, but higher attrition resistance than
dolomite [34e36]. Adding calcined dolomite to the fluidized bed
inventory of the gasifier allows to reduce the tar content in the dry
product gas from two digit numbers down to 1e2 g/Nm3, while
with olivine the corresponding average value is 5e7 g/Nm3.

Ni-based reforming catalysts show higher activity and selec-
tivity for tar conversion to hydrogen-rich gas, increasing noticeably
the gas yield at the expense of char and tar, but suffer from (i)
mechanical fragility, (ii) rapid deactivation mostly due to sulphur,
chlorine, alkali metals, coke,
(iii) metal sintering, altogether
resulting in limited lifetime [37]. Ni-based catalysts are also very
effective to reduce the NH3 content in the product gas. Very positive
results with respect of all points just mentioned were obtained by
impregnation of olivine with nickel [38]. The mechanism of the
active phase formation in Ni-olivine under biomass gasification
conditions is well understood [39] and the large scale preparation
controlled. The positive features of natural olivine (mechanical
resistance and activity in tar reforming) are combined with those of
nickel catalysts (high activity in reforming of hydrocarbons),
without the disadvantages encountered with commercial products.
The Ni-olivine catalyst showed very good resistance to attrition and
coke formation, with an order of magnitude reduction in the tar
content of the product fuel gas, when utilized instead of a bed made
entirely of olivine, in a pilot scale (100 kW thermal) dual fluidized
bed gasifier as primary catalyst for tar destruction and methane
reforming [26]. The major drawback to an extensive utilization of
Ni-olivine in the fluidized bed of biomass gasifiers is represented by
existing stringent
constraints on nickel manipulation and
discharge, Ni being a heavy metal. Its use would increase consid-
erably the cost of disposal of contaminated biomass ash.

It is well known that olivine samples with similar general
composition and phase structure may show different catalytic ac-
tivity depending on the degree of integration of iron into their
respective crystalline structure [40]. Calcination of iron-bearing
olivines in air leads to the oxidation of iron and formation of iron
free oxides, the presence of which affects the olivine activity. The
amount of iron oxides formed is dependent on calcination time and
temperature [40,41]. Recently, using an optimized impregnation
method, the Fe content of olivine was enriched with an additional
10 wt% (corresponding to a total iron weight percentage of about
16 wt%), and catalytic biomass gasification experiments were per-
formed at bench scale [42]. The abatement of tar content is shown

qualitatively (by visual comparison of liquid samples collected in
the tar condensers) and quantitatively in Fig. 2, as a function of the
gasification temperature, in relation to fully similar tests with sand
(catalytically neutral) and olivine. The Feeolivine material has a
double effect on tar destruction: on one hand, it acts as a catalyst for
tar and hydrocarbon reforming; on the other hand, it is also active
in relation to water gas shift reaction, at high temperature.

When 10 wt% Feeolivine was utilized in a pilot gasifier instead
of olivine, the gas yield increased on average by 40% and the
hydrogen yield by 88%; correspondingly, the methane content in
the syngas was reduced by 16% and tar production per kg of dry ash
free (daf) biomass by 46% [43]. Complete characterization and
micro-reactor reactivity data are also available for Feeolivine ma-
terials containing up to 20 wt% of iron [44] and definitively confirm
the interest of addition of iron on olivine.

2.1.3.

In bed abatement of detrimental trace elements

Studies were performed on high temperature separation of H2S,
HCl and other detrimental trace elements, like alkalis, and heavy
metals, by means of appropriate sorbents to be added to the flu-
idized bed inventory of the UNIQUE gasifier [45,46]. Thermody-
namic process models assuming Gibbs free energy minimization
were utilized to investigate the fate and removal of sour gases and
alkali species in the biomass gasification process, as a function of
different composition of inlet streams and gasifier temperature
[47,48]. To confirm theoretical findings, experimental tests were
performed on conventional and innovative synthetic solid sorbents
suitable to be utilized at the operating conditions of the gasifier and
able to assure very low concentration levels of these contaminants
in the gas phase, comparable with threshold values recommended
for solid oxide fuel cells and production of biofuels by chemical
syntheses (see also the following Section 3 about polygeneration
strategies).

Contaminants are typically removed in downstream equipment.
Adding suitable sorbents to the fluidized bed inventory of the
gasifier (see Fig. 1) allows for an additional beneficial effect: the
improvement of catalyst activity for tar reforming in the filtering
elements placed in the freeboard of the gasification reactor.

2.1.3.1. Sour gases. The experimental evidence indicates that Ni-
catalysts are suitable to convert tarry fuel gases into a clean syn-
gas even if hydrogen sulphide is present: with H2S concentrations
below 100 ppmv, as it is the case of most biomass gasification
processes, the catalyst activity is slightly reduced, however the
remaining activity is constant, even after substantial operation
time, and complete conversion of naphthalene (a key tar

phase on a support are the strategies commonly explored to over-
come these problems.

Experimental work done at real conditions for the H2S removal
or with simulated coal gas has led to the conclusion that fuel gas
composition does not have a large influence on the desulphuriza-
tion performance, except for the minimum residual H2S level. The
thermodynamic equilibrium is worse when CO, CO2, H2O are pre-
sent [54]. With CeO2, it is indicated that the presence of H2O has no
negative impact [55], and this seems to be true also with CuO-
eAl2O3 sorbents [56].

Data of H2S sorption experiments on packed beds of Ca- and Cu-
based sorbents (Fig. 4) show that these are not suitable to reduce
the H2S concentration below 1 ppmv at 700e900 (cid:3)C. The sorbent
composition has an influence on the achievable H2S reduction: slag
lime, which contains several oxides beside calcium oxide, achieves
the best H2S reduction (down to 50 ppmv) of all Ca-based sorbents.
In order to meet the requirement of 1 ppmv H2S, a new sorbent
was synthesized according to thermodynamic predictions indi-
cating that stabilized, Ba-based sorbents should be effective; the
“CaBa” sorbent was prepared from a mixture of 10 mol-% BaCO3 and
90 mol-% CaCO3.

The CaBa sorbent allowed to achieve H2S concentrations lower
than 0.5 ppmv (the detection limit in these experiments) in the
temperature range of 800e900 (cid:3)C [46]. The stabilization effect was
confirmed by the XRD spectra showing the occurrence of a BaS
phase. At temperatures below 760 (cid:3)C the H2S concentration in the
effluent stream raises up to 175 ppmv due to carbonation of the
sorbent: the CaBa sorbent regeneration could therefore be possible
by cooling the saturated sorbent under non-oxidizing atmosphere.
The sorption data also showed that the CaBa sorbent is able to
reduce the HCl gas content below 1 ppmv over the temperature
range 800e900 (cid:3)C [46]. The formation of BaCl2 phases is confirmed
by the XRD spectra.

Fluidized bed gasification tests at pilot scale (100 kWth) done at
Vienna University of Technology with the CaBa sorbent, confirmed
the tendency toward lowered H2S content in the product gas.
However, such tests show only qualitative trends; the operating
conditions, like sorbent particle size and amount charged into the
gasifier, still need to be optimized.

2.1.3.2. Alkali species. Alkalis and heavy metals cause fouling and
corrosion by condensing. As a result of the potassium and chlorine
content of biomass, KCl is the most important compound released
during biomass gasification. Aluminosilicates have shown the

Fig. 4. H2S concentration in the gaseous stream leaving the sorbent sample [46].

component) has been demonstrated with model gases treated by a
catalytic filter in these condition [49e51]. Of course, the presence of
H2S at such levels is expected to determine serious problems for
downstream chemical syntheses and at the fuel cell anode, espe-
cially for fuel cell operation at temperatures below 1000 (cid:3)C [14]: for
most applications of the product gas the utilization of appropriate
sorbents is therefore required, the development of which is
described below in this chapter.

An additional issue is that of separation of the sorbents from the
remaining constituents of the gasifier bed inventory, with the aim
to perform regeneration and cyclic utilization of them: classifica-
tion based on particle size appears as the most appropriate means.
Calcium based sorbents have been recognized for a long time as
effective media to capture H2S at high temperature; the sulphida-
tion of both, calcined and uncalcined limestone, has been studied
extensively [52,53]. However, thermodynamic limitations, espe-
cially in presence of a considerable content of steam in the gas
phase, can hardly allow to reach H2S concentrations as low as those
required by SOFC. Alternative systems are all characterized by
drawbacks of different nature, spanning from reduction of sorption
capacity with temperature (iron oxide), metal vaporisation (zinc
oxide), oxide reduction by H2 and CO (copper oxide) [14]. Combi-
nations of different metal oxides and high dispersion of the active

ability to reduce the alkali concentration to the ppb-level under
gasification conditions [57]. In addition, aluminosilicates rich in
alumina remove chlorine [57] and heavy metals like zinc [58]. Al-
kalis contaminated gases have high condensation temperatures, so
that the attention is often focused on the analysis of the sorbent
capacity more than on the gas purity at the outlet of the sorption
treatment, the latter being rarely determined in a direct way and
more often back-calculated from the sorbent conversion.

The thermodynamic calculations of KCl sorption on alumino-
silicates show that the alkalis concentration in the gasifier derived
gases can be limited to values of 100 ppbv to 4 ppmv depending on
the biomass type. Although KCl is the most abundant of all alkali
species in the syngas, NaCl is the alkali species with the highest
concentration in the cleaned gas. Thus, the condensation temper-
ature decrease depends on the residual NaCl concentration in the
cleaned gas. This ranges from 530 to 630 (cid:3)C, resulting in a drasti-
cally reduced risk of fouling and corrosion downstream the gasifier,
specifically when a SOFC is operated (at temperatures of about
800 (cid:3)C).

The sorption experiments reported in Ref. [46] were performed
at packed bed conditions and atmospheric pressure. The inlet gas
stream was laden with KCl by overflowing a KCl source set at
700 (cid:3)C; the KCl gas concentration was about 20 ppmv, determined
by the change in weight of the KCl source at the end of each
(cid:4)1 no evidence of kinetic
experiment. At a space velocity of 9800 h
limitation was observed. The results of the KCl sorption tests
confirm that aluminosilicates are suitable sorbents for KCl removal
below 100 ppbv at 800e900 (cid:3)C (Fig. 3).

Fluidized bed gasification tests at atmospheric pressure in
presence of bauxite for the removal of the most abundant alkali
halides, i.e. KCl (and NaCl), confirmed the suitability of alumino-
silicate sorbents for the removal of alkali halides released during
gasification processes [59]. These materials (bauxite, bentonite,
kaolinite and naturally occurring zeolites) are easily available,
cheap and without environmental implications for their disposal
when exhausted.

2.1.4. Tar and dust abatement by catalytic filter candles in the
gasifier freeboard

Laboratory tests at real process conditions (a 400 mm high
filter candle segment integrated in the freeboard of a 100 mm ID
gasifier electrically heated) and proofs of concept at the Güssing
dual fluidized bed gasification plant, run by Biomasse Kraftwerk
Güssing GmbH & Co. KG (a prototype candle inserted in the
gasifier freeboard and processing a slip stream of raw syngas)
confirmed that nickel-based catalytic filters of different design can
be used successfully in integrated high temperature reforming of
tar and removal of particles from biomass gasification product.
Fig. 5 shows the arrangement of the bench scale facility used for
the lab tests [60], while Fig. 6 shows a sketch and the P&I flow-
sheet of the test module realized in Güssing [61]; in the latter case,
the filter candle is cleaned periodically from the dust cake by
means of a rather conventional back pulsing system for rigid hot
gas filter elements. Nitrogen is used as the blowback gas for
regeneration, properly preheated to overcome possible conden-
sation problems.

Both types of test showed that the particulate content of the
cleaned gas is practically brought to zero, making it compatible
with the most sophisticated applications (fuel cells): in the Güssing
test the reference values were 56.3 and 23.6 g/Nm3, respectively for
the dust and char content of the raw gas in the gasifier freeboard.
Tar content reduction is as high as 95%; at bench scale a greater
methane conversion was obtained (with a maximum value of 40%;
at plant scale methane content decreased only from 10.1 to 8.1%).
The reference values are in both cases those obtained with olivine

fluidized bed and without filter candle. The dry gas yield
improvement obtained with the catalytic filter candle and quanti-
fied in the bench scale tests is in the range 70e100%, and the total
carbon in the permanent gaseous phase per kg of biomass is
increased on average by 30% as a result of tar conversion in smaller
molecules. This substantial increase in the gas yield is partially
counterbalanced by a reduction in the LHV of the fuel gas by
13e16%.

Fig. 7 shows the characterization of tar samples obtained from
bench gasification runs with catalytic candles, compared to the
reference test without candle [62]. The experimental rig is always
that schematized in Fig. 5; all tests were performed with a fluidized
bed of olivine particles; in the catalytic tests, the product gas is
made to percolate through an Al2O3 based catalytic filter candle
positioned in the gasifier freeboard. Test I is characterized by a
gasification time of 6 h, while the overall duration of Test II is 20 h
(three consecutive periods called a, b and c, with intermediate char
burning steps). The catalytic filter candle used in Test II contained
additional catalyst integrated in the hollow cylindrical space within
the porous candle structure. Tar samples were collected in 2-
propanol according to the UNI CEN/TS 15439 protocol and ana-
lysed by HPLC/UV. Quantitative determination was carried out by
using calibration curves of pure standard tar compounds: phenol
(Ph-OH), toluene (Tol), styrene (Styr), indene (Ind), naphthalene
(Nap), biphenyl (Bph), diphenyl ether (DphE), fluorene (Fle),
phenanthrene (Phe), anthracene (Ant), fluoranthene (Fla) and
pyrene (Pyr) [55]. Among different tar species, toluene appears as
the prevailing compound after the catalytic reforming treatment.

the

candle,

In the reference test (without candle) less than 60% of the
hydrogen content of the biomass was found in the product gas as
H2, while in each test with the catalytic candle this value greatly
exceeded 100% as a result of enhanced hydrocarbon reforming re-
actions with steam. To quantify the reforming activity of the cata-
lytic

namic equilibrium values calculated at the test respective condi-

are fixed as a result of equilibrium attained for the wateregas shift
(WGS):

where the empirical formula chosen for biomass (C21H30O14) agrees
with the composition of almond shells utilized in the experimental
tests.

As shown in Fig. 8, the water conversion obtained experimen-
tally is quite close to equilibrium values in almost all tests with a
catalytic candle. This is a noteworthy result, as low water conver-
sion is often considered as a drawback for steam gasification [63].
In the catalytic candle, methane and tar steam reforming takes
place together with WGS: from the experimental results and
thermodynamic calculations it is estimated a corresponding ther-
mal energy demand of the order 0.5 MJ/kg of biomass. The
enhancement of the reforming reactions inside the gasifier vessel
allows to optimize the supply of this thermal load, provided by
gasification itself, with respect to alternative process layouts with

downstream equipment for gas conditioning treatments, where
energy from additional sources is often required [64].

Pressure drop measurements through the catalytic filter candle
fitted in the reactor freeboard were performed on the empty sys-
tem (without the particulate bed in it) at different temperature
levels, and as a function of the filtration velocity (Fig. 9A). The data
reported here are generally higher than those exhibited by a non-
catalytic filter of the same structural characteristics, the reduction
of porosity brought about by impregnation and the presence of
more rough surfaces being the main reasons for this effect [63]. The
figure shows an increase of pressure drop with temperature at the
same filtration velocity, mainly ascribable to the increase of gas
viscosity. On the other hand, data in Fig. 9B were obtained during
different gasification runs (about 800 (cid:3)C) and show the increase of
pressure drop with time due to the build-up of a dust cake on the
filtration surface. Two different filtration velocities are considered:
the pressure drop measured at the beginning of each test (clean
filter candle) is quite compatible with that reported previously in

After substantial gasification time, the data points seem to reach a
plateau suggesting that the thickness of the powder cake tends to a
stable value; in industrial applications, pressure drop across the
filter candle is controlled by a periodic blowback of clean gas, as
was shown in Fig. 6. As a whole, the operation of the filter candle in
the gasifier freeboard appears to be a promising option for hot gas
cleaning toward tar and particulate. However, the overall technical
feasibility is not yet proven as the long term behaviour at industrial
conditions is still an outstanding issue: innovative ceramic porous
structures resistant to the gasifier freeboard environment and
temperature peaks were recently developed by Pall Filtersystems
GmbH and fully assessed at laboratory scale [65] and tests are in
progress at the Güssing plant to verify the long term reliability
required by commercial applications.

2.2. Combination of pyrolysis and gasification

Gasification as a thermochemical process to convert carbona-
ceous material into gas by using a gasifiying agent comprises
several overlapping process steps, such as heating and drying, py-
rolysis, oxidation and gasification. The overlapping of these process
steps makes it impossible to control and optimize the different
steps separately in a one-stage gasifier. Moreover, interaction be-
tween volatiles and char can have negative impact on the reactivity
and gasification of the char [66]. Thus, char gasification should be
performed in the absence of the volatiles in order to increase the
gasification efficiency. Modern, advanced gasification concepts
separate the pyrolysis and the gasification steps in single controlled
stages which are combined in a multi-stage gasification process.
High gas purity with low levels of tar and high process efficiencies
with high char conversion rates are possible.

There are two different approaches which have been followed.
The first one combines pyrolysis and gasification directly in a two or
three stage gasification process. The different stages can be com-
bined in one unit with separated pyrolysis and gasification zones or
in separate reactor units combined in a series. The second approach
performs pyrolysis and gasification at different locations. In this
concept pyrolysis aims to concentrate biomass at decentralized
small pyrolysis plants for an economical transport of the biomass

pyrolysis products (liquid and solid) to a centralized large gasifi-
cation plant in order to produce biofuels.

2.2.1. First approach e multi-stage gasification

Multi-stage gasification processes perform pyrolysis and gasifi-
cation controlled in separated zones in the gasifier or in single

combined reactors. This enables conversion of the biomass under
optimized operating conditions for the single steps. Main reason for
the development and use of a multi-stage gasification process is
that a clean syngas with low tar content can be achieved.
Furthermore, the overall process efficiency and the product quality
and quantity can be enhanced compared to a one-stage gasification.
Several gasification processes according to the multi-stage
gasification concept separating pyrolysis and gasification zones
have been developed recently. Some examples are the 75 kWth
Viking gasifier developed at the Danish Technical University [67],
the FLETGAS process developed at the University of Sevilla in Spain
[6] and the LT-CFB (low temperature circulating fluid bed) gasifi-
cation process developed by Dong Energy company from Denmark
[68].

The Viking gasifier (see Fig. 10) is a two-stage process with a
screw pyrolysis reactor followed by a fixed bed downdraft gasifi-
cation reactor. The outlet of the pyrolysis reactor is directly com-
bined to the gasification reactor. Between the pyrolysis and the
gasification zone air is added to partially oxidize the pyrolysis
products. By the partial oxidation and by passing the char bed, the
tar content in the syngas is reduced to less than 15mg=mN
3. The
produced gas contains about 32% H2, 16% CO, 20% CO2, 30% N2, and a
small amount of CH4 of about 2%. The higher heating value of the
gas is about 6:6mg=mN
3 [67]. A cold gas efficiency of 93% has been
reported for the process [69]. The Viking gasifier has recently been
upscaled to a 200 kWe gasifier and work is in progress for a 500 kWe
gasifier [3].

The FLETGAS process (see Fig. 11) is a special designed three-
stage gasification process. In the first stage, devolatilization in a
fluidized bed reactor takes place with low conversion of tar and
char at temperatures between 700 and 750 (cid:3)C. Air and steam can be
added in this stage at reduced amount to keep the temperature low
to have just the devolatilization. High amount of reactive tar is
produced. In the second stage, the tar is reformed with steam at
high temperature of 1200 (cid:3)C. In the third stage, the char generated
in the first stage is gasified in a moving bed downdraft reactor. The

gas coming from the second stage flows through the char bed
which serves as a catalyst for further tar reduction. The char pro-
duced in the first stage is directly transported from the first stage to
the third stage via a gas seal solid transport part [70,71]. Some
modelling work [6] has been performed showing the advantages of
the process compared to one-stage fluidized bed gasification. A
significant decrease of the tar concentration to 10mg=mN
3, char
conversion of 98% and gasification efficiency of 81% compared to tar
concentration of 31g=mN
3, char conversion of 59% and gasification
efficiency of 67% for the one-stage fluidized bed gasification has
been shown which is an interesting result of this new concept. The
composition of the gas was calculated on a dry basis with: 55 %N2,
13% CO, 15% CO2, 4% CH4, 8% H2, and 2% C2H6. The higher heating
value was calculated with 6:4MJ=mN
3. Some experimental work
[72e74] has also been performed to develop the process. The pro-
cess is still under development at pilot scale [6]. Besides the proof of
the concept by operation of a pilot unit a techno-economical
assessment would also be needed to prove the economical
benefit of this concept. A drawback seems to be the high complexity
of the reactor set-up.

Fig. 12 shows the schematic principle of the LT-CFB gasifier. The
gasifier has two stages. The first stage is a circulating fluidized bed
pyrolysis reactor operated at about 650 (cid:3)C. The second stage is a
bubbling fluidized bed reactor operated at about 730 (cid:3)C for the
gasification of char. Gasification of char is possible at this low
temperature since the residence time in the gasifier is high. The
gasifier is autothermally operated by using air as an oxidizing
medium. Sand and ash are recirculated from the bottom of the
gasifier to the pyrolysis reactor carrying the heat for the pyrolysis of
the biomass. Additionally, the char gas is redirected to the pyrolysis
reactor. In between the two reactors, a cyclone is installed to
separate char and sand from the gas. Char and sand enter the
gasifier and pyrolysis and char gas are cleaned in a second cyclone
from the ash [68]. After testing the process in a 100 kWth [75] and a
500 kWth unit [3], a 6 MWth demonstration plant has been built and
is in operation since 2012 in a power plant owned by Dong Energy
where the produced gas is co-fired with coal [68]. The LT-CFB
gasification process has been developed for the use of more diffi-
cult biomass feedstocks, such as straw, manure fibres, sewage
sludge and different organic wastes [3]. Cold gas efficiencies of
87e93% have been achieved in tests with the 500 kWth unit [3]. A
gas composition of 3.5% H2, 16.3% CO, 14.5% CO2, 59% N2, 4.3% CH4
and higher heating values between 5:2 and 7MJ=mN
3 have been
achieved [76]. It is reported that the two-stage process is robust, the

company in Germany [78e80]. Fig. 13 shows the Carbo-V process
schematically. The first process stage is a pyrolysis reactor, called
low temperature gasifier. The second process stage is a combustion
chamber where the pyrolysis gas and recycled char from the
deduster is oxidized with pure oxygen. The third process stage is a
gasification reactor. The char produced in the pyrolysis reactor is
gasified in this stage by using the combustion gas from stage 2 as a
reacting agent. Since the reactions in the third stage are strongly
endothermic, this stage is also called chemical quenching [79]. The
process has been demonstrated in a 1 MWth plant in long-term
operation for the production of biofuels. A cold gas efficiency of
82% and an almost tar free gas has been reported for the process
[80]. The gas composition was 34.6% H2, 36.8% CO, 22.6% CO2, 1.7%
N2, 0.4 CH4, and 3.9% H2O [81]. An upscale of the process to a
45 MWth plant was commissioned and a test program was started
but not completed due to insolvency of Choren in 2011 [82]. Main
reasons for the stop of the 45 MW plant have been seen in problems
related to the scale-up of the new technology. This extended the
commissioning of the plant far beyond the planned schedule and
increased the costs so that the investors decided to stop their
funding [83,84]. The technology has been acquired by the German
company Linde in 2012 [85]. Linde reported about 1 year after the
acquisition of the Carbo-V technology that they have refined the
process to a level that demonstration with a partner can commence
[86]. Forest BtL Oy from Finland has recently bought a licence from
Linde for using the Carbo-V process in a new BtL (Biomass to Liquid)
plant with a gasification capacity of 480 MW. Forest BtL Oy selected
the Carbo-V technology since this multi-stage gasification process
offers a high fuel conversion to syngas and a high syngas quality
[87].

An overview of the described multi-stage gasification processes
is given in Table 3. It can be concluded that very low tar concen-
trations in the producer gas are achieved by the different multi-
stage gasification processes. Also higher char conversion and gasi-
fication efficiencies are achieved compared to one-stage gasifica-
tion processes (see Table 1). The complexity of the gasification
process is increased by combining different reactors. However, this
can be compensated by a simpler subsequent gas cleaning process.

construction is cheap and requires low maintenance. Alkalines are
maintained in the ash due to the low process temperature [77].
However, the produced gas has a high tar content ð > 4:8g=mN

[76]. Thus, use of the gas in engines, fuel cells or for biofuel pro-
duction is not possible without further gas cleaning.

Besides the recent new developments, there has been so far one
multi-stage gasification process separating pyrolysis and gasifica-
tion in different reactors which has been built and operated in large
scale e the three-stage Carbo-V process developed by the Choren

2.2.2. Second approach e use of pyrolysis and gasification at
different locations

A special concept to use pyrolysis and gasification at different
locations has been developed under the name bioliq process by the
Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) [88e90]. In the bioliq
concept (see Fig. 14), biomass is concentrated into an oil-char slurry
in multiple decentralized small pyrolysis plants. The concentrated
oil-char slurry is then transported to a large central process plant

be tested and stable atomization and gasification have to be proven
for these different slurries.

An economical assessment of the bioliq concept has shown that
the production of gasoline and olefins from biomass by this process
is not competitive compared to current market prices. Only sub-
sidies, e.g. from tax reduction and CO2 certificates, could currently
enhance the competitiveness of the biofuels [91].

2.3. Combination of gasification and combustion

Concepts which combine gasification with a combustion stage
aim on one hand at increasing the overall process efficiency by
combining combustion of unreacted char for additional heat pro-
duction or on the other hand for the conversion of tar by partial
combustion to achieve a product gas with a lower
tar
concentration.

A third concept is to implement the gasification process for co-
firing of the product gas in a coal combusted power plant. This
option reduced the requirements with regard to the gas purity
significantly and needs no additional gas cleaning and conditioning
equipment downstream of the gasifier. Thus, the process set-up can
be kept very simple and cost-effective.

2.3.1. Dual fluidized bed process with internal combustion

Biomass gasification is globally an endothermic process, so that
it requires providing thermal energy to the reactor. This can be
done in different ways that in most practical applications involve
burning part of the gasification products, including sometimes
auxiliary fuels made available by downstream purification treat-
ments. In this context, air is the most common gasification agent
utilized in gasification plants: the excess of thermal energy avail-
able in industrial installations allows to heat up the air stream to
the gasifier above ambient temperature and to close the energy
balance satisfactorily. The ratio between biomass and air fed to the
gasifier, commonly related to what would be needed by a stoi-
chiometric biomass combustion process, is expressed as a fraction
of it and called equivalence ratio. In the case of fluidized bed gas-
ifiers, the air flow rate should also comply with an adequate
fluidization regime.

A major drawback of this simple and cost effective arrangement
is contamination with nitrogen of the product gas, with N2 molar
fraction values of 50% and more, resulting in a substantial reduction
of the gaseous fuel heating value (LHV) down to 4e5 MJ/Nm3, still
acceptable for generating power with internal combustion engines,
although unsuitable for more sophisticated and efficient energy
applications (fuel cells) and chemical syntheses. To avoid this
problem, air could be replaced by oxygen (enriched air) and steam
mixtures, with the additional benefit to enhance tar reforming
reactions and char gasification. However, this choice implies oxy-
gen (enriched air) availability. With small to medium size biomass
gasification units (operating at ambient pressure) and readily
available gas separation systems, air enrichment would be mainly
accomplished by selective nitrogeneoxygen sorption systems
requiring feed gas compression, that is compression of a volumetric
gaseous stream up to 5 times larger than the oxidant used in the
gasification process, with a substantial penalty of the whole energy
efficiency.

With fluidized bed gasification systems, a more efficient
arrangement is obtained by physically separating gasification and
combustion reactions and utilizing the mineral particle bed (sand,
olivine) to transfer heat between them. Fig. 15 illustrates thermal
and mass fluxes within the system [100], while Fig. 16 shows
schematically the application of this principle to biomass gasifica-
tion [101]. This is realized by means of dual fluidized bed (DFB)
systems. Relevant DFB biomass gasifiers and their major features

for gasification of the slurry and synthesis of biofuels. The concept
is based on the use of low-grade lignocellulosic biomass, such as
straw or forest residues. The energy density of the oil-char slurry is
increased by about ten times compared to the initial energy density
of straw. Thus, transportation of the oil-char slurry is much more
economical than that of the untreated biomass [91].

A demonstration plant of the bioliq process has recently been
built at KIT in Germany [92]. The process comprises the following 4
process steps: 1) Fast pyrolysis to produce the oil-char slurry in a
separate decentralized pre-step, 2) Gasification of the slurry to
produce syngas, 3) Hot syngas cleaning and conditioning, 4) Syn-
thesis of the biofuel.

Fast pyrolysis has been chosen since short reaction times give
higher yields of pyrolysis oil [93]. The slurry is gasified in a 5 MWth
Lurgi entrained flow gasifier at an operating pressure of 8 MPa [92].
Even if entrained flow gasifiers are widely used for gasification of
water based coal slurries or refinery residues, the gasification of
such pyrolysis oil-char slurry is new and part of several experi-
mental investigations related to the atomization of the oil-char
slurry as well as to the modelling of the gasification of the slurry
[94].

The syngas is cleaned in a completely dry hot gas cleaning
process [95]. First the syngas is filtered at 800 (cid:3)C in a special
designed ceramic hot gas filter, where the filter elements are hor-
izontally installed [96]. In a typical hot gas filter design, filter can-
dles closed at one end are installed vertically hanging in a
tubesheet [97]. An advantage of the design with horizontally
installed filter elements is a more compact design of the filter with
a smaller footprint and size of the filter vessel. A problem can be the
regeneration of the filter elements which requires a very efficient
backpulse system to remove the dust cake also from the top side of
the horizontally installed filter elements. Downstream of the filter,
chloride and sulphur gas components, such as HCl and H2S, are
removed by sorbents and tars are catalytically reformed in a
following step.

Open issues which need to be addressed by further research are
how storage (storage conditions and duration) influences the
properties and composition of the bio-oil and accordingly the at-
omization and the gasification behaviour of the oil slurry. Due to the
composition, bio-oil generally tends to change during its storage. Bio
oil from pyrolysis of biomass is a mixture of different components,
such as furfural, phenols, aldehydes, ketones, esters, ethers etc. [98],
having a quite high content of oxygen and water. Depending on the
biomass feedstock, oxygen content is usually in the range of 35e40%
and the water content is between 15 and 30% [99].

Furthermore, the properties of different oil-char slurries coming
from different locations and different biomass feedstocks have to

the utilization of steam as an additional gasification agent that
improves gas quality (lower tar content). In comparison to more
traditional installations, the complexity of plant layout and opera-
tion is increased, however the syngas quality is also increased
remarkably, opening the way to more diversified utilization options
and to polygeneration strategies.

The capacity of the Güssing plant is about 8 MW (electrical
output of 2 MWe and district heating output of approximately
4.5 MWth). This dual fluidized bed reactor was developed at the
Institute of Chemical Engineering of Vienna University of Tech-
nology (TUV) in cooperation with AE Energietechnik, and known
internationally under the name FICFB (fast internally circulating
fluidized bed) gasification system [103e105]. The construction of
the Güssing plant was started in September 2000, and electricity
was first generated in April 2002; since then, the plant has been
operating regularly, and the present utilization index is above
7000 h/year. A number of literature references about dual fluidized
bed systems for biomass gasification can be found in Koppatz et al.
[101]. Recently, the TUV FICFB CHP technology has been applied in a
number of gasification installations in Austria, Germany and
Sweden.

The gas cleaning (Fig. 17 [103]) has been investigated and
developed by RENET Austria (Energy from Biomass Network of
Competence): it is made in three different and integrated ways.
Fine hydrated lime is injected into the system to obtain a primary
reduction of tar to less than 1 g/Nm3, which allows enhanced re-
covery of sensible heat from the product gas stream; particulate
filtration is operated smoothly at about 150 (cid:3)C; the fuel gas is then
contacted with biodiesel (RME) in a scrubbing column, to reach a
3 and a temperature of about 50 (cid:3)C.
tar content of about 20mg=mN
Exhausted biodiesel is used as an additional fuel in the combustion
section of the gasifier, and condensed water recycled to the gasi-
fication section, so that disposal of liquid streams is avoided.

Finally, the dual fluidized bed gasification system is well suited
to exploit the advantages brought about by a reduction of CO2
content in the product gas by absorption on basic oxides [106]: the
use of a CO2 sorbent minimizes carbon oxides and enhances the
equilibrium conversion of catalytic tar and CH4 steam reforming
allowing to clean the gaseous fuel and improve the H2 yield. The
practical feasibility has been demonstrated by adding calcined
limestone or dolomite to the reactor bed inventory. The sorbent
circulates between the gasifier e CO2 capture bubbling bed, and the
combustor e calciner riser: in the reactor chamber devoted to
biomass gasification and CO2 capture, the endothermic gasification
and the exothermic solid carbonation processes combine well
together and their coupling reduces the amount of the solid cir-
culation rate required to sustain thermally devolatilization and
gasification reactions. On the other hand, the riser provides the
calcined solid sorbent and the remaining thermal loading. When
oxygen (instead of air) is utilized for combustion reactions in the
riser, a CO2 stream is easily obtained (by steam condensation),
available for storage and sequestration.

The thermodynamic constraints of the reaction between CO2
and CaO impose, at ambient pressure, a temperature level for
gasification somewhat lower (650e700 (cid:3)C) than the usual one
(800e850 (cid:3)C). However, the experimental evidence at pilot and
industrial scale [107,108] does not show substantial increase of tar
content in these conditions. The H2 yield in the dry product gas is
increased up to 70%.

2.3.2. Gasification with partial combustion

Thermal treatment of tar is one method for the reduction of tar
concentration in biomass gasification gas [28,13]. At high temper-
ature, the stability of tar is reduced and tar can be converted or
cracked into lighter gases. However, thermal reduction of tar is a

have recently been reviewed by Kaushal et al. [102] and Goransson
et al. [17].

The well-known CHP plant in Güssing is the prototype industrial
application of dual fluidized bed biomass gasification: the gasifier is
a bubbling bed fluidized by steam, where the biomass feedstock is
devolatilized, and organic vapours and char are properly steam
reformed to obtain permanent gases (CO, CO2, H2, CH4); the gran-
ular bed material is continuously circulated by means of a chute
(and a loop seal) to a fast circulating bed fluidized by air, where any
non-gasified fuel particles transported along with the bed material
are fully burnt, together with additional fuel properly injected,
determining an increase in temperature of the particulate solid of
50e100 (cid:3)C above that in the gasifier; solid and gaseous phases are
then separated at the top of the riser/combustor in a cyclone-type
device, and hot particles are brought back to the gasification
chamber by means of a second loop seal that avoids gas mixing
between gasifier and combustor, to provide the heat required by
the gasification reactions. By adjusting properly the solid circula-
tion rate, steady state behaviour is obtained at the desired gasifi-
cation temperature. As a result, air and steam can be used as
gasification agents while keeping a very low nitrogen concentra-
tion in the fuel gas, permitting LHVs of about 12e14 MJ/Nm3 and

quite complex process and the result depends highly on the process
parameters. For example, it has been shown that just heating a tar
containing gas by an external heat source to a temperature of
900e1150 (cid:3)C leads to polymerization reaction of light tar compo-
nents and to the formation of soot instead of the cracking of the tars
[109].

Partial combustion has been attracting increasing interest of
researchers in recent years as a method to achieve thermal tar
conversion. Air/fuel ratio, hydrogen concentration, methane con-
centration, temperature and free radicals produced during the
combustion influence the cracking or polymerization reactions of
the tar components.

Houben et al. [109] investigated tar reduction by partial com-
bustion by using naphthalene as model tar component at a very low
concentration of 2:6mg=mN
3 in a mixed gas stream of hydrogen,
methane and nitrogen. It has been shown that without oxygen
addition polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and soot were formed.
Also, if too much oxygen was added, PAH and soot were formed. For
a very low air to fuel ratio of l 1⁄4 0.2, the partial combustion reduced
the tar content by more than 90%. For l > 0.2, the tar concentration
increased. Thus, an optimum was found in the amount of air added
for the reduction of the naphthalene. For l > 0.4, polymerization to
higher tar rings and sooting prevailed. It has also been found that
hydrogen and methane have an influence on tar reduction.
Hydrogen acts as an inhibitor for the formation of soot. With
increasing hydrogen concentration, the amount of higher tar ring
components decreased. At hydrogen concentrations higher than
20% nearly all naphthalene was converted to benzene or permanent
gases. For higher methane concentrations and very low hydrogen
concentrations, polymerization to higher tar ring components and
soot formation was observed.

Naphthalene as model tar component doesn't simulate the tar
composition of real gases correctly. Real tar is composed of a lot of
different components and has typically high concentrations of
benzene and toluene which are the most stable tar species and
require high temperatures above 1200 (cid:3)C for their effective
reduction (see e.g. Ref. [110]). At the same time, high temperatures
favour the formation of coke. Zhang et al. [110] showed that coke
formation starts at 900 (cid:3)C having a maximum at 1100 (cid:3)C.

The influence of the hydrogen concentration on the presence of
free radicals in the partial combustion process has been studied by
van der Hoeven et al. [111]. Their investigation showed that a
higher hydrogen concentration has positive influence on tar
cracking due to increased reaction rates, higher amounts of free
radical generated, and longer residence times of the radicals.

Svensson et al. modelled soot formation during partial oxidation
of gasifier product gas [112]. They simulated different gas compo-
sitions and used naphthalene as a tar component. The simulation
results showed decrease of soot formation with increasing the
hydrogen concentration in the gas as well as an increase of soot
formation in the case of increased methane concentration. This is in
qualitative agreement with the experimental results by Houben
et al. [109]. However, the influence of the hydrogen concentration
on the soot formation was very low in the simulation which re-
quires further investigations. In all simulated cases soot was formed
and could not significantly be reduced expect when no naphtha-
lene was added to the gas. In this latter case about 50% less soot was
formed compared to the base case where naphthalene was added
in an amount of 0.5 mol% of the total incoming gas flow.

Ahrenfeldt et al. [113] showed higher tar reduction with
increasing air ratio for the partial oxidation of real gas from the
pyrolysis of wood pellets. They showed complete conversion of
phenol for l > 0.3 and temperatures above 950 (cid:3)C. For lower air
ratios higher temperatures were required to get the same result.
Above 900 (cid:3)C phenol and other primary tars were converted into
low molecular weight PAH, primarily naphthalene. The tar con-
centration in the raw pyrolysis gas was quite high (above 200 g/
kgwood).

Investigations of Brandt et al. [114] showed a minimum of the
tar concentration at an air ratio of l 1⁄4 0.5 for partial oxidation of gas
from the pyrolysis of straw. For higher air ratios the tar concen-
tration slightly increased. The tests were performed at 800 and
900 (cid:3)C. The tar reduction was nearly comparable for both tem-
peratures. Composition of the tar downstream of the partial
oxidation reactor as well as soot
formation has not been
investigated.

Su et al. [115] investigated the partial oxidation of gas from the
pyrolysis of rice straw. Maximum tar reduction has been achieved

86

S. Heidenreich, P.U. Foscolo / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 46 (2015) 72e95

at an air ratio of l 1⁄4 0.34 at a temperature of 900 (cid:3)C. Phenolic
compounds were completely converted for l > 0.2. It is reported
that oxygen increases the reaction rate and can promote the for-
mation of free radicals for initial tar cracking reactions. For air ratios
above 0.278 only PAHs e naphthalene, fluorine, phenanthrene and
pyrene e can be found in the gas. Higher air ratios lead to formation
of higher PAHs. This agrees with the results of Houben [109] (see
above).

Partial combustion for tar reduction has already been applied
successfully in some recent multi-stage gasification concepts, such
as the Viking gasifier (described in Section 2.2) for which a tar
reduction by partial combustion by a factor of 100 has been re-
ported [67] or the newly developed Fraunhofer ISE gasification
process for production of synthesis gas with tar contents below
50mg=mN
3 [116]. The partial combustion in these multi-stage
gasifiers aims to increase the temperature of the pyrolysis gas
required for the subsequent endothermic char gasification reaction.
In a single stage gasification process, a partial combustion stage
downstream of the gasifier is typically not used since the high
temperature required for an efficient conversion of tars reduces the
energy efficiency of the process. Additionally, it reduces the syngas
yield.

2.3.3.

Implementation of gasification in coal fired power plants
Co-firing of biomass in coal fired power plants is a simple way to
substitute fossil fuels by renewable ones [117e119]. At the first
sight, the easiest and least expensive way is direct co-firing of
biomass in the boilers. Up to about 3% of biomass on energy basis
can be directly co-fired with minimal additional investment costs
[1]. However, the properties of biomass as fuel are quite different
compared to coal. Biomass has lower ash content, higher oxygen
content, higher content of volatiles, lower density and heating
value, grinding is more difficult due to fibre structures and some
have high alkali and/or halogen content [120]. Thus, direct co-firing
of biomass can result in several problems, especially if higher
amounts of biomass shall be co-fired. These problems are mainly
related to the different properties of the biomass ashes due to high
alkaline and chlorine contents. Main problems which are reported
are corrosion, slagging and fouling in the boiler as well as in the
heat exchanger and in the piping, poisoning of DeNOx catalysts and
performance problems in electrostatic precipitators [121e124].

One approach to overcome these problems is indirect co-firing
of biomass by biomass gasification. Biomass is gasified in a
gasifier and the produced gas is co-fired in a coal fired boiler [125].
Up to 10% of the thermal capacity of the boiler can be co-fired
without the need of reconstruction of the boiler and auxiliary de-
vices. For higher ratios major changes of the boiler would be
required [117].

The first power plant where this concept has been used was the
Kymij€arvi power plant in Lahti (Finland) [126,127]. The power plant
has an electrical power production capacity of 167 MW and a dis-
trict heat production capacity of 240 MW. A Foster Wheeler CFB
(circulating fluidized bed) gasifier was started-up at the beginning
of 1998. Depending on the feedstock and its moisture content the
capacity of the gasifier is 40e70 MWth (nominal capacity 50 MWth).
Raskin et al. [127] reported on the successful operation of the plant.
Wood chips, wet and dry waste wood, saw dust, bark, shredded
tires, plastics as well as recycled fuels were successfully gasified.
The recycled fuels comprised mainly paper, cardboard and wood,
and about 5e15% plastics. It was demonstrated that the concept of
indirect co-firing of biomass by gasification is a successful way to
generate heat and power by using different types of biomass and a
way to operate an existing coal fired boiler with only small modi-
fications. The power plant could be operated in a flexible way by
adjusting the amount and the type of biomass which was co-fired.

Based on the successful operation in Lahti, the concept of indi-
rect co-firing of biomass by gasification using a CFB Foster Wheeler
gasifier similar to the one in Lahti has been applied at the coal fired
Ruien power plant of Electrabel in Belgium [128e131]. The gasifier
was commissioned in December 2002 and commercial operation
started in May 2003. The gasifier is installed at the boiler of unit 5 of
the power plant. Unit 5 has a power output of 190 MWe on coal. No
pre-treatment (drying, grinding) of the biomass as well as no
cleaning and conditioning of the produced gas are required. The
quality of the gas is sufficient to be burned in two burners, which
are installed below the coal burners in the boiler. Wood residues
from the local wood industry as well as fresh wood chips are used
as a feedstock. About 9% of the coal is substituted by gas from the
biomass gasification and 120 000 t/year CO2 emissions are saved
[131].

In the Netherlands, an 85 MWth CFB Lurgi gasifier is in operation
for indirect co-firing of biomass since 2002 at unit 9 (net produc-
tion capacity: 600 MWe and 350 MWth) of the Amer power station
of Essent in Geertruidenberg [132,133]. Low quality demolition
wood is mainly used as a feedstock. About 90 000 t biomass was
gasified in 2010 generating an electric capacity of about 33 MWe
[133].

In Austria, a 10 MWth, CFB biomass gasifier designed by Austrian
Energy was installed for indirect co-firing of biomass with coal at
the Zeltweg power plant (137 MWe, 344 MWth) [134,135]. The
gasifier was commissioned in 1997 and shut down in April 2001
due to shut down of the power plant. Mainly bark and wood chips
were gasified.

After 2003, the interest in the concept of indirect co-firing of
biomass by gasification declined. However, recently the interest
in this concept increased again and new biomass gasifiers were
installed at coal fired power plants. In Denmark, Dong Energy
installed a 6 MWth LT-CFB biomass gasifier (see Section 2.2),
which is in operation since 2011, at its Asnaes power plant [68].
Straw is mainly used as a feedstock. In Finland, the so far world's
largest biomass gasifier has been inaugurated in March 2013
[136]. The gasifier, a 140 MW CFB gasifier designed and supplied
by Metso, was installed at the 560 MWth coal fired power plant
of Vaskiluodon Voima Oy in Vaasa [137]. Between 25 and 40% of
the coal consumption of
the plant will be substituted by
biomass.

Indirect co-firing of biomass by gasification is a concept which is
well proven by long-term operating experience in large coal fired
power plants, as mentioned above. This concept has several ad-
vantages which can be summarized as follows:

- Easy and cost-effective way to reduce fossil CO2 of coal fired

power plants

- Purity and quality of the produced gas can be low to be burned
in the boiler. Thus, no high efficient gas cleaning and condi-
tioning or cooling equipment is required and the investment
costs are lower than in cases where high gas quality and purity
are needed.

- High flexibility in using a broad range of biomass feedstocks,
including low quality biomass as well as RDF (refuse derived
fuels).

- Biomass which generates problems in direct co-firing, e.g. straw,

can be used.

- Compared to direct co-firing, no drying or grinding is required.
- High biomass conversion; residual fine char particles and tars

are burnt in the boiler.

- No operating dependency on availability of biomass; biomass

can be substituted by fossil fuel.

- No influence on the operating availability of the power plant by

possible problems with the gasifier.

87

- Less coal ash pollution than in direct co-firing (coal ash is often
used in concrete production). Less biomass ash enters the boiler
since coarser ash particles are removed in the cyclone of the CFB
gasifier and returned into the gasifier where they accumulate
and are removed as bottom ash.
If higher percentages of
biomass are co-fired or higher coal ash purity is needed, a hot
gas filter [97] can additionally be used to remove fine ash par-
ticles from the produced gas without energy loss due to cooling.

3. Polygeneration strategies

Polygeneration is an approach to improve the economic and
sustainability of the utilization of biomass via gasification. Poly-
generation refers to the combined production of at least two
products. The goal is to maximize the transformation efficiency of
the energy and material of the feedstock into products. Syngas from
biomass gasification can be converted into a broad range of prod-
ucts, e.g. electricity, heat, gaseous or liquid fuels or chemicals. As an
additional advantage, polygeneration offers flexibility with regard
to changes of market demands. For example, a polygeneration
process for the combined production of biofuels, heat and power
could be used as a back-up power plant. If the current electricity
consumption increases, the production of biofuels can be switched
to the production of power.

However, higher flexibility comes with higher capital invest-

ment costs as well as higher operation and maintenance costs.

Combined heat and power production is a classical example for
a polygeneration process. Newer approaches aim to combine SNG
(synthetic natural gas) or hydrogen and heat production, or bio-
fuels, and heat and power production.

3.1. Combined heat and power production (CHP)

Power production is generally coupled with the production of
heat. If the heat can be used, the overall process efficiency can be
significantly increased. Whereas electricity can be easily trans-
ported and distributed, heat has to be produced close to the user.
For this reason, decentralized heat and power production by
smaller units is preferred, and larger units of several hundreds of
MW as typically used for power production are not an option.
Interesting ways to use the heat are for example CHP plants of a few
MW coupled to district heating systems, CHP plants below 1 MW
for heating large public or commercial buildings, public swimming
pools, hospitals, hotels or apartment buildings, or CHP plants
installed at pulp and paper plants, at saw mills etc. where biomass
waste can directly be used to produce electricity, heat or steam for
the local plant. Combined heat and power production by biomass
combustion is already widely used [138]. However, CHP by biomass
gasification offers some advantages, such as higher biomass to
power efficiency [3,139], and higher flexibility concerning the used
feedstock as well as the applied electricity generation process [140].
First CHP applications by biomass gasification started at the
beginning of the 1990s [141]. CHP biomass gasification plants with
capacities of a few MW of biomass input have demonstrated several
years of successful operation showing the overall reliability of the
technology and the achievable high process efficiency. Some ex-
amples are the 5.2 MWth Harboøre plant (start-up in 1993) [3,142,9]
and the 26 MWth Skive plant (start-up in 2006) [9] in Denmark, the
8 MWth plant in Güssing (start-up in 2002) [143], the 2 MWth plant
in Wiener Neustadt (in operation from 2003 to 2007) [144,145], the
8.5 MWth plant in Oberwart (start-up in 2008) [9] and the 15 MWth
plant in Villach (in operation from 2010 to 2013) in Austria as well
as the 15 MWth plant in Ulm (start-up in 2012) in Germany [146]. In
most of the plants just mentioned, overall process efficiencies of
about 90% and biomass to electricity efficiencies from 25 to 31% are

reported. In all cases gas engines are used for electricity generation
showing increased efficiency of newer gas engine types. The pro-
duced heat is used for district heating.

An approach to increase the amount of generated electricity is
applied in the 15 MWth plant in Ulm in Germany where in addition
to 2 gas engines an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is installed for
electricity production [146]. By using ORC, some of the heat
(10e15% of the heat) [9] can be additionally converted into elec-
tricity. Combining gas engines with ORC, biomass to electricity ef-
ficiencies of more than 40% are achievable.

Another approach to increase the electricity efficiency, is the
integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) process, where a gas
turbine and a steam turbine are combined to generate electricity.
The IGCC process has been used for coal gasification since the mid-
1990s, showing electricity efficiencies of up to 46% for plant sizes of
200e300 MW [147,148]. Theoretical investigations (see e.g. Ref.
[149]) show that even overall electrical efficiencies of up to 53%
could be possible with an IGCC process. For biomass, the IGCC
process has been applied in the 18 MWth (6 MWel and 9 MWth for
district heating) demonstration plant in V€arnamo in Sweden
[150,151]. The plant was operated from 1993 to 1999 when the
demonstration program was completed. The plant had a net elec-
trical efficiency of 32% and a total net efficiency of 83% [150]. Since
small steam turbines have a low electrical efficiency [152], an IGCC
process is only interesting for larger scales.

A technology for electricity generation which has already gained
a high interest is the fuel cell technology. Fuel cells offer the ad-
vantages of very high electrical efficiencies, an environmental
friendly operation and they can be used from some hundreds of
kilowatts down to 1 kW for very small scale applications. Solid
Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs), which operate at high temperatures with
hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane and their mixtures as
fuel [14] are specifically considered as a good option to be com-
bined with biomass gasification. For application as CHP, the high
exhaust temperature of the SOFC is an advantage to use the heat.
However, even if the biomass gasification syngas composition is
generally well suitable as fuel for a SOFC, it has to be cleaned to
achieve the high requirements of the fuel cell with regard to im-
purities. Aravind and de Jong [14] gave a very comprehensive
literature review of the different contaminants in the raw syngas,
their influence on the performance of a SOFC and techniques to
remove them. They concluded that it is possible to clean the syngas
to meet the requirements of a SOFC. They proposed a gas cleaning
set-up comprising a series of fixed bed reactors and 2 ceramic hot
gas filters.

Many performance models and theoretical analyses of the
combination of SOFCs and biomass gasifiers show the high poten-
tial of this combination with electrical efficiencies from 34 to 45%
and CHP efficiencies from 74 to 80% [153e157].

A further increase of the electrical efficiency is possible by
combining a SOFC and an additional Micro-Gas Turbine (MGT) with
a biomass gasifier. By adding the MGT, the excess fuel in the exhaust
gas from the SOFC can be used to generate additional electricity.
The combination of a SOFC and an MGT with a biomass gasifier
offers a very efficient power production solution for small decen-
tralized CHP plants. Recent modelling studies of Bang-Møller et al.
[158] showed an electrical efficiency of 58% and a CHP efficiency of
87.5% for an optimized process using the two stage Viking gasifier
combined with a SOFC and an MGT. Morandin et al. [159] have
recently modelled nine different system configurations using either
an internally circulating fluidized bed gasifier or the Viking two
stage gasifier and different combinations as CHP unit, just a SOFC, a
SOFC combined with a steam cycle and a SOFC combined with an
MGT. Their thermo-economic analysis showed that the combina-
tion of a fast internally circulating fluidized bed gasifier with a

88

pressurized operated SOFC and MGT is the most promising
configuration with an electrical efficiency of 65%.

However, combination of SOFC and biomass gasification has not
been demonstrated on full scale and for long-term operation yet.
Experimental investigations have only been performed with single
cells or very small stacks, and for short test durations of about
5e150 h (see e.g. Refs. [160e162,69,163]). Only one test has been
performed for longer test duration of 1200 h [164].

Based on the published experimental results, the following

conclusions can be drawn:

(cid:2) SOFCs can successfully be operated by using cleaned biomass
gasification syngas. General feasibility of the combination of
biomass gasification with a SOFC is shown. However, demon-
stration on full scale and for long-term operation is still missing.
(cid:2) The cell performance depends on the syngas composition and

fluctuations of both can be correlated [161].

(cid:2) The risk of carbon deposition increases with higher concentra-
tion of methane and tars. However, carbon deposition can be
prevented by addition of steam.

(cid:2) However, if steam content is too high, the risk of nickel oxida-
tion of the anode is increased resulting in cell performance
degradation [163].

(cid:2) Inefficient particle removal from the syngas causes ash deposits
and prevents a smooth long-term operation [160]. For this
reason fly ash and char particles have to be removed efficiently
from the syngas.

(cid:2) Besides particle removal, efficient removal of gaseous impu-
rities, such as tars, sulphur compounds, alkalines, chlorides and
ammonia, is important to prevent poisoning of the anodes [14].
(cid:2) Attention has to be taken on the syngas composition. Higher
concentrations of methane, propane and higher hydrocarbons in
the biomass syngas increase the rate of internal reforming, if no
separate external reformer unit is used, and cause thermal stress
which may result in cracking of the cells [161].

Finally, it can't be concluded which one of the available tech-
nologies for combined heat and power production should be fav-
oured. It depends on case specific conditions which CHP technology
is preferred. One important condition beside investment costs,
earnings or incentives for heat and power supply and availability
and cost of biomass is the local annual heat demand. Gas engines
are well proven and have a relatively high electrical efficiency at
relatively low investment costs. SOFCs and the combination of
SOFCs with MGTs are promising technologies which offer very high
power generation efficiencies even at very small size. However,
long-term testing on full scale size is still missing and will be an
important topic for future investigations.

3.2. SNG, heat and power production

SNG from biomass is considered as a renewable clean fuel
substitute for fossil fuels in heating, CHP and transportation sys-
tems. Bio-SNG is also regarded as a flexible renewable energy car-
rier. The existing natural gas pipeline system offers the advantage
for an easy transportation and storage of the SNG. Gas heaters,
boilers and engines as well as natural gas cars and buses are
available as established clean technologies for the use of SNG.
Several methanation processes were developed in the past for the
production of SNG from coal gasification syngas. One of these
processes is e.g. the well-known Lurgi process using a series of
adiabatic fixed bed reactors. A comprehensive review on metha-
nation technologies has been given by Kopyscinski et al. [165].

Before the methanation reaction can be performed, the pro-
duced syngas has to be cleaned and conditioned. The gas cleaning

aims to remove particulates, tars, alkali and sulphur components.
The removal of these components has to be very efficient in order to
protect downstream catalysts from poisoning. Conditioning of the
gas comprises typically a wateregas shift to adjust the needed H2/
CO ratio of 3 or more for the methanation reaction. After the
methanation, water and CO2 as well as unreacted hydrogen and
impurities of ammonia are removed from the SNG to achieve the
required gas quality, for example to deliver the SNG to the gas grid.
More details of the process are given in the literature (see e.g. Refs.
[165e167]).

In the last 10 years, the production of SNG from biomass gasi-
fication syngas has gained increasing interest and has been inves-
tigated by some research groups such as the Energy Research
Center of the Netherlands (ECN) and the Paul-Scherrer Institute
(PSI) in Switzerland [165].

Recently, the feasibility to produce SNG from biomass gasifica-
tion syngas has been demonstrated in a 1 MW scale at the Güssing
plant [168]. ECN operates a 0.8 MWth SNG pilot unit [169]. A
thorough investigation by Wirth and Markard showed that Bio-SNG
plants require a size of 20 MW or larger to be economical since the
process including gasification, gas cleaning, catalytic methanation
and CO2 separation is complex and expensive [170].

The first commercial Bio-SNG plant of a size of 100 MW will be
built in the GoBiGas project in G€oteborg in Sweden [171,172]. In the
first phase of the project, a 20 MW plant has been erected. In the
second phase a 80 MW plant will be built which shall start oper-
ation in 2016. There are further plans for large commercial Bio-SNG
plants, e.g. the 200 MW Bio2G project of EOn in Sweden [173].

Finally, there is the question whether the effort to produce SNG
from the syngas is valuable. If the SNG is used for domestic heating
and cooking, it would be a shorter chain to use the syngas directly
instead of having an additional production step to produce SNG and
to increase the costs and drop the process efficiency. The reason
why the additional step to produce SNG is taken is that the existing
distribution system for natural gas can easily be used for SNG which
is a big advantage and justifies the higher effort. In areas where no
natural gas distribution system is available it would be more
beneficial to use the cleaned syngas directly for household heating
and cooking like it has already been practised e.g. in China in rural
areas [174]. However, a risk of the direct use of the syngas is the
toxicity of the CO contained in the gas.

Compared to domestic heating by wood combustion, Bio-SNG is
less efficient and about twice the wood quantity would be required
to produce the same quantity of heat [175]. Also power production
by using Bio-SNG is less efficient than using the syngas from
biomass gasification directly.

However, Bio-SNG as renewable fuel for transportation can have
an efficiency advantage. Felder and Dones [176] showed in their
evaluation of the ecological impact of Bio-SNG that the preferential
use of SNG is as a transport fuel for cars to substitute oil based fuels.
Fahlen and Ahlgren [177] concluded in their study that it is more
economical to use Bio-SNG as vehicle fuel than to use it for power
and heat production. Ahman [178] showed in his assessment of Bio-
SNG as a transport fuel that Bio-SNG can be produced cost effi-
ciently already at low to medium scale plants of 20e100 MW
whereas the production of liquid biofuels require larger scale plants
to be competitive. Additionally he stated that the production effi-
ciency of Bio-SNG is higher than for DME, methanol or Fischere-
Tropsch diesel.

Production of Bio-SNG in a polygeneration plant offers several
process possibilities with high overall process efficiencies of up to
90%. For example, excess heat of the process can be used for district
heating [177] or part of the excess heat can be transformed in a
Rankine cycle to co-produce power [179]. The integration of SNG
and electricity via biomass gasification in a district heating system

S. Heidenreich, P.U. Foscolo / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 46 (2015) 72e95

89

offers economic benefit and reduces CO2 emission [180]. Poly-
generation of Bio-SNG can offer a high flexibility on market de-
mands by adjusting the requested amounts of Bio-SNG, heat and
power or just balancing the demands by producing the Bio-SNG as
an energy storage.

In a polygeneration system there is also the possibility to
operate the gasifier with the aim to produce a syngas with a higher
content of methane and to separate this methane directly from the
syngas avoiding the need of a subsequent methanation process. The
remaining syngas can then be used for heat and power generation
for example.

3.3. Biofuels, heat and power production

Comparable to Bio-SNG, biofuels, such as FT diesel, DME and
methanol, are considered as renewable clean fuel substitutes for
fossil transportation or heating fuels. Additionally, liquid biofuels
generate less emissions than oil based fuels.

Since the use of liquid fuels for cars and trucks is state of the art,
and accordingly an expanded infrastructure of oil based re-fuelling
liquid biofuels can be relatively easily
stations exists globally,
introduced and used in the market. This is the main advantage for
the use of liquid biofuels for transportation compared to SNG or
hydrogen from biomass.

Polygeneration of liquid biofuels, heat and power offers as main
advantages high process flexibility and process efficiencies up to
about 90% [3] which is similar to the polygeneration of Bio-SNG,
heat and power described in the previous section. The advantage
of a polygeneration versus a stand-alone production has been
concluded from several technoeconomic analyses.

Narvaez et al. [181] showed in a recent case study that a poly-
generation plant for the production of methanol and power has a
better performance and higher flexibility compared to the separate
stand-alone production plants. Furthermore, they showed savings
of the syngas consumption as well as the possibility to compensate
a decrease of the catalyst activity by an increase of the syngas feed
rate for the methanol production route and using the unreacted
syngas afterwards for power production.

Haro et al. [182] concluded in their assessment of 12 different
process concepts based on DME as intermediate and considering
ethanol, methyl acetate, DME, H2 and electricity as final products
that the highest internal rate of return is given by a concept of
producing methyl acetate, DME and electricity and that the poly-
generation is more profitable than a single product plant.

Meerman et al. [183] concluded in their study that the eco-
nomics of a flexible polygeneration FT-liquid facility is better than
its stand-alone counterpart.

Djuric Ilic et al. [184] showed in their study that polygeneration
of biofuels with co-production of heat and power has a higher
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions than the stand-alone pro-
duction of biofuels.

Comparing the production costs of biofuels to fossil fuels,
different techno-economic analysis have shown that biofuels have
to be supported by tax or CO2 incentives in order to be competitive
(see e.g. Refs. [185,91]). The production costs decrease with
increasing size of the production plant [186].

3.4. Hydrogen and heat production

Hydrogen generated from biomass can be an interesting envi-
ronmental friendly and renewable energy carrier mainly for the use
in fuel cells in stationary as well as transportation applications.
Gasification of biomass produces a syngas rich in hydrogen if steam
or oxygen and steam are used as a gasification agent. If air is used as
a gasification medium, the nitrogen dilutes the syngas leading to a

low hydrogen concentration and a high effort of hydrogen
purification.

In order to separate and purify the hydrogen from the syngas
pressure swing adsorption or membranes can be used. To achieve
high hydrogen content in the syngas a reforming stage and addi-
tionally a water gas shift stage typically follows the gasifier.

Toonssen et al. [187] modelled 10 process configurations with
and without heat recovery based on different gasifiers. They
calculated exergy efficiencies between 45 and 50% for the cases of
hydrogen production without heat recovery and between 62 and
66% with heat recovery. The hydrogen yield for the different gas-
ifiers was between 97 and 106 g per kg of dry biomass. Bhatta-
charya et al. [188] calculated in their model for an oxygen blown
gasification process a similar hydrogen gas yield of 102 g per kg dry
biomass.

Tock and Marechal [189] compared in their thermo-economic
modelling the hydrogen production from natural gas and from
biomass with regard to energy efficiency optimization by poly-
generation of hydrogen, heat and power and including CO2 capture.
They concluded that the system performance is improved by pro-
cess integration maximizing the heat recovery and valorizing the
waste heat. They calculated an energy efficiency of 60% for
hydrogen production by biomass gasification compared to 80% ef-
ficiency for hydrogen production by steam reforming of natural gas.
Shabani et al. [190] investigated hydrogen production by gasi-
fication of rice husk combined with heat recovery for electricity
generation by 2 Rankine cycles. They used a GE gasifier operated at
1200 (cid:3)C and 3 MPa with oxygen as gasification medium in their
model. Hydrogen efficiency of 40% and net electrical efficiency of
3.25% has been calculated if CO2 is not compressed for capture and
storage. With CO2 capture and storage the net electrical efficiency
drops to 1.5%.

Abuadala and Dincer [191] modelled a quite complex integrated
system for polygeneration of hydrogen, heat and power. They
considered a system comprising steam gasification of saw dust, a
coupled SOFCeSOEC (solid oxide electrolyser cell), steam reformer,
water gas shift reactor, compressors, gas turbine and burner. They
concluded that their results give an indication for hydrogen pro-
duction costs which are quite favourable and have potential for
practical applications.

Beside the aforementioned theoretical studies, an experimental
investigation of an efficient integrated process to produce hydrogen
is developed in the frame of the UNIfHY research project funded by
the European Commission [21]. The system developed in this
project comprises a UNIQUE gasifier (described in Section 2.1), a
water gas shift reactor and a pressure swing adsorption unit. Purge
gas is recirculated to the gasifier to be used as a heat source for the
endothermic reactions in the process. It is predicted that the pro-
cess with the integration of several subsystems will achieve high
hydrogen conversion efficiencies of higher than 66% [21].

4. New gasification concepts

4.1. Plasma gasification

In a plasma, gas molecules are ionized by electric discharges. A
plasma is highly reactive due to the electrons, ions and the high
energy density in the gas. To generate a plasma, direct current (DC)
discharge, alternating current (AC) discharge, radio frequency (RF)
induction discharge or microwave discharge are typically used.
Thermal and cold plasmas can be distinguished. Cold plasmas are
generated at vacuum pressure whereas thermal plasmas are ach-
ieved at atmospheric pressure. As plasma gases argon, nitrogen,
hydrogen, water vapour or gas mixtures are used. The temperatures
of thermal plasmas can be 5000 K and higher. Thermal plasma

90

gasification units often use DC or AC arc plasma torch generators.
Fig. 18 shows 2 different DC arc plasma torch generator concepts
[192]. Generators up to 10 MW power are commercially available
[193]. Fig. 19 shows as an example a plasma gasification reactor
where the reactor chamber is connected to a non-transferred DC
arc plasma torch generator [194].

The very high temperatures of thermal plasmas enable an effi-
cient decomposition of any organic material into its elemental
molecules. For this reason plasma gasification has gained interest
for the treatment of toxic organic wastes as well as for rubber and
plastic waste. Inorganic matter is recovered as a vitrified slag. En-
ergy can be generated from the gasification of the waste. For
example, a plasma gasification plant in Utashinai (Japan) is in
operation since 2002 gasifying up to about 300 tons per day of
municipal solid waste and automobile shredder residues and pro-
ducing 7.9 MWh electricity with a net production of 4.3 MWh
delivered to the grid [192].

Even if the main application for plasma gasification is waste
treatment, the use of plasma gasification has gained attraction for
syngas production from biomass. Gasification of injected biomass
in the plasma takes place within milliseconds without any inter-
mediate reaction at the very high temperatures [195]. Advantages
of plasma gasification are syngas with high hydrogen and CO
content, low CO2 content, low tar concentration, high heating value,
useable for wet biomass, such as sewage sludge [196,197], no in-
fluence of particle size and structure of the biomass.

Disadvantages are the high electricity consumption to operate

the plasma, high investment costs, and lower efficiencies.

Plasma gasification of biomass has been investigated by several
researchers recently. Hlina et al. [198] have investigated the gasi-
fication of wood saw dust, wood pellets, waste plastics and oil from
the pyrolysis of waste tires in a DC electric arc plasma with a torch
input power of about 100 kW. A mixture of water vapour with a
small amount of argon was used as plasma gas. CO2 or water vapour
was added as an oxidizing medium. For all 4 feedstocks, a syngas of
high quality with about 90 vol% H2 and CO was produced. They
evaluated the efficiency of the process by comparing the low
heating value of the produced gas to the torch input power. Due to
the high electricity input the efficiency of the process is low. For the
gasification of the pyrolysis oil the energy efficiency of the process
is even negative.

Rutberg et al. [199] evaluated plasma gasification of wood for
combined heat and power production. By using an AC air plasma
with a power input of 2.2e3.3 MJ/kg they produced a syngas with
13.8e14.3 MJ/kg. By calculations they showed the potential to
achieve a net electric energy conversion of 46%.

for biomass pyrolysis operated at

Tang and Huang [200] investigated a lab-scaled RF plasma
reactor
low pressure
(3000e8000 Pa). They produced two products, a gas of 66 wt% of
the biomass feed as well as char. The gas was a mixture of H2, CO,
CO2 CH4, light hydrocarbons and almost no tars. The energy loss of
this lab reactor was quite high and the energy input to the biomass
feedstock accordingly low.

A comparison between DC arc plasma gasification and conven-
tional air gasification has been modelled based on non-
stoichiometric chemical equilibrium for different feedstocks by
Janajreh et al. [194]. Air gasification showed a higher efficiency than
plasma gasification. They calculated an average process efficiency
of plasma gasification of about 42% compared to a process effi-
ciency of 72% of air gasification. The difference is caused by the high
energy consumption of the plasma.

Plasma gasification of distiller grains residues has been inves-
tigated in a 10 kW plasmatron reactor by Shie et al. [201]. A syngas
with 50e55 vol% H2, 40e44 vol% CO, 2e3 vol% CO2 and 1.4e2.5 vol%
CH4 was achieved.

In order to overcome the high energy consumption and high
investment costs of DC plasmas, several researchers have investi-
gated the use of microwave plasmas for gasification of carbona-
ceous feedstocks (see e.g. Refs. [202e205]). All these investigations
were performed on small lab-scale with power inputs from 1 to
5 kW. Gasification of glycerol from biodiesel production in a mi-
crowave plasma was performed by Yoon et al. [203]. They produced
a hydrogen rich syngas with 57% H2 and 35% CO without any oxy-
gen feed. The carbon conversion was 80% in this case. Feeding ox-
ygen decreased the hydrogen content and the heating value of the
gas and increased the CO2 content and the carbon conversion. Quite
similar results were also reported for the gasification of coal and
charcoal [204].

Even if lab studies showed that a syngas with high hydrogen
content can be achieved by microwave plasma gasification, the
possibility of an upscale to technical gasifiers with high through-
puts seems very unlikely.

4.2. Supercritical water gasification

Conversion and gasification of organic hydrocarbons in super-
critical water has already been fundamentally investigated since
the mid of the 1970s. In the last 10 years interest in supercritical
water gasification of biomass increased and progress has been
made in the investigation of technical processes. Several review
papers on supercritical water gasification of biomass have been
published giving overview of the fundamentals and reactions as
well as details and problems of the process (see e.g. Refs.
[206e208]). Furthermore, several studies on the usability of
different feedstocks, such as e.g. agricultural wastes, leather wastes,
switchgrass, sewage sludge, algae, manure, olive mill wastewater
and black liquor, have been performed (see e.g. Refs. [209e215]).

Water in its supercritical condition e above its critical point of
p 1⁄4 22.12 MPa and T 1⁄4 374.12 (cid:3)C (see Fig. 20) e has unique prop-
erties as solvent and as reactant. Solubility of organic materials and
gases is significantly increased and materials which are insoluble in
water or water vapour can be dissolved whereas solubility of
inorganic material is decreased.

Main components in the produced gas are H2, CH4 and CO2. CO
content is typically low since CO reacts further by water gas shift
and methanation reaction [209]. Tar and coke formation is inhibi-
ted by fast solution of the formed gas components in the super-
critical water. At reaction temperatures below 450 (cid:3)C, CH4 is the
main component in the produced gas, whereas at reaction tem-
peratures above 600 (cid:3)C hydrogen is dominant [216]. At tempera-
tures above 600 (cid:3)C, water is a strong oxidant and reacts with the
carbon and releases hydrogen [217].

Main advantages of biomass gasification in supercritical water
are: wet biomass can be treated without pre-drying, even liquid
biomass waste can be treated e e.g. olive mill wastewater [214],
production of hydrogen-rich gas, high gasification efficiency, low
tar formation. Main disadvantages are: high investment costs due
to the need of special corrosion and high pressure and high tem-
perature resistant materials, and high energy need to heat up the
water to the reaction temperature.

The use of catalysts can reduce the reaction temperature and
thus the equipment and operating costs. Furthermore, they can

enhance the conversion rate and the hydrogen yield. Several cata-
lysts have been tested for supercritical water gasification of
biomass including the typical reforming catalysts, such as Ni and
Ru, activated carbon, Pt-based catalysts, alkali metal based mate-
rials, such as trona, KOH, NaOH, K2CO3. Overviews are recently
given e.g. in the papers of Elliott [218], Guo et al. [216], and Azadi
and Farnood [219].

The energy efficiency of the supercritical water gasification of
biomass has been studied by different researchers. Marias et al.
[220] modelled the gasification of vinasse in supercritical water.
They showed that the best gasification efficiency of their process of
about 87% was achieved at a reaction temperature of 600 (cid:3)C. By
thermodynamic modelling of a supercritical water gasification
process for hydrogen production from wet biomass, Lu et al. [221]
showed an energy and exergy efficiency of their process of more
than 40%. Energy loss results from heat transfer mainly in the heat
exchanger, the cooler, the preheater and the reactor. High heat
transfer efficiency increases the energy efficiency of the system. As
an alternative to very efficient heat exchangers, oxygen can be
added to the process in a small amount to make the process
energetically self-sustainable with only a small loss of the heating
value of the produced syngas [222]. A polygeneration process for
the production of methanol and power by supercritical water
gasification of glycerol has been studied by Gutierrez Ortiz et al.
[223]. Power was produced by a turbine and a fuel cell in their
study. They calculated an overall net energy efficiency of their
proposed process of 38% for a gasification temperature of 1000 (cid:3)C.
Even if progress has been made in supercritical water gasifica-
tion of biomass in recent years and this technology seems to be very
interesting especially for wet biomass, technical solutions still need
to be developed for large-scale production.

5. Conclusions

Biomass is one of the main renewable energy sources beside
wind and solar energy. In contrast to wind and solar energy,
renewable energy production from biomass can be adjusted to
current consumption need. Gasification is a key technology for the
use of biomass offering high flexibility and efficiency. New
knowledge and more efficient and cost-competitive industrial ap-
plications are required for the long run, showing evidence of
promising developments and cross-fertilization with sectors other
than energy, which may provide ideas, experiences, technology
contributions, new approaches, innovative materials and skills.

The detailed survey of this paper showed some very interesting
new concepts and strategies in biomass gasification. These con-
cepts and strategies aim to promote the application of biomass
gasification in the future. New advanced process integration and
combination concepts enable higher process efficiencies, better gas
quality and purity, and lower investment costs. Polygeneration
biomass gasification facilities for the production of more than one
product in combined processes achieve a highly efficient use of
biomass. Furthermore, these facilities offer the flexibility to pro-
duce electricity when it is needed and if it is not needed to produce
biofuels or chemicals from the syngas. This flexibility is not free of
charge. It is coupled to higher investments in both the reactors as
well as in the power generation equipment. However, back-up
power plants are needed at all and the required investments can
be made in polygeneration plants.

In this frame, the development of innovative catalysts, sorbents
and high temperature filtration media was shown to represent a
fundamental requirement to increase yield and purity of the
biomass gasification product, to allow efficient conversion into
power (high temperature fuel cells; gas turbines; combined, strictly
integrated heat and power plant schemes) and further catalytic

processing addressed to second generation bio-fuels (liquid fuels
for transportation, hydrogen) and chemicals. Thanks to de-
velopments in new materials preparation, characterization and
testing at real
industrial conditions, poly-generation strategies
focussed on biomass, adaptable to different demands and markets,
can be implemented and enforced with success.

High temperature gas cleaning and catalytic conditioning is the
focal point to promote industrial applications of biomass for energy
and chemicals. To avoid unacceptable increase of plant and oper-
ating costs, gas treatments should be strictly integrated with
biomass conversion and carried out at a close temperature range, to
preserve the thermal energy content of the biomassegas.

Polygeneration by biomass gasification offers high potential and
flexibility, however, development and realization of polygeneration
strategies is highly influenced by national governmental energy
strategies. According to current prices of fossil based fuels and
electrical energy, CO2 incentives and tax supports are required to
achieve an economically competitive production of biomass based
fuels and power.
