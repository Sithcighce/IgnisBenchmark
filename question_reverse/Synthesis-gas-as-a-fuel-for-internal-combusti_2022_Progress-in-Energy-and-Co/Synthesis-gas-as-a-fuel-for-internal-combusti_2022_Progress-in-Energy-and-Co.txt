The adverse environmental impact of fossil fuel combustion in engines has motivated research towards using 
alternative low-carbon fuels. In recent years, there has been an increased interest in studying the combustion of 
fuel  mixtures  consisting  mainly  of  hydrogen  and  carbon  monoxide,  referred  to  as  syngas,  which  can  be 
considered as a promising fuel toward cleaner combustion technologies for power generation. This paper pro-
vides an extensive review of syngas production and application in internal combustion (IC) engines as the pri-
mary or secondary fuel. First, a brief overview of syngas as a fuel is presented, introducing the various methods 
for its production, focusing on its historical use and summarizing the merits and drawbacks of using syngas as a 
fuel.  Then  its  physicochemical  properties  relevant  to  IC  engines  are  reviewed,  highlighting  studies  on  the 
fundamental combustion characteristics, such as ignition delay time and laminar and turbulent flame speeds. The 
main body of the paper is devoted to reviewing the effect of syngas utilization on performance and emissions 
characteristics  of  spark  ignition  (SI),  compression  ignition  (CI),  homogeneous  charge  compression  ignition 
(HCCI),  and  advanced  dual-fuel  engines  such  as  reactivity-controlled  compression  ignition  (RCCI)  engines. 
Finally, various on-board fuel reforming techniques for syngas production and use in vehicles are reviewed as a 
potential route towards further increases in efficiency and decreases in emissions of IC engines. These are then 
related to the research reported on the behavior of syngas and its blends in IC engines. It was found that the 
selection of the syngas production method, choice of the base fuel for reforming, its physicochemical properties, 
combustion strategy, and engine combustion system and operating conditions play critical roles in dictating the 
potential advantages of syngas use in IC engines. The discussion of the present review paper provides valuable 
insights for future research on syngas as a possible fuel for IC engines for transport.   

1. Introduction 

Worldwide,  approximately  80%  of  useful  energy,  including  high- 
quality  heat,  propulsion  work,  and  electricity,  is  produced  by 
combustion-driven processes using fossil fuels. The main detriments of 
the  application  of  fossil  fuels  in  IC  engines  are  their  contribution  to 
global  warming  and  environmental  pollution,  and  therefore  govern-
ments are encouraging the use of zero/low-carbon fuels in power and 
propulsion systems for achieving energy security and meeting emissions 
targets [1,2]. In the coming decades, both IC engine efficiency and fuel 
technology  must  improve  and  contribute  to  achieving  carbon-neutral 
transportation  [3].  Engine  technology  must  also  use  fuels  that 

minimize greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on a well-to-wheel basis to 
meet  worldwide  emissions  legislation  [4].  The  next  generation  of 
cleaner  fuels  is  governed  by  several  important  factors,  including  the 
availability of the feedstock, production efficiency and environmental 
impact,  distribution  and  storage,  safety  issues,  integration  and 
compatibility with engines, vehicle, and transportation systems – costs, 
regional variations, standardization and public acceptance [5,6]. In this 
regard,  natural  gas  [7,8],  hydrogen  [9]  and  ammonia  [10,11]  and 
optimized engines [12] have recently drawn much attention from en-
gine researchers to meet the future emission standards. 

Hydrogen (H2) has been considered as a viable energy carrier for fuel 
cells and future IC engines. The wide flammability range of hydrogen 
makes  it  suitable  for  engine  operation  over  a  wide  range  of  air-fuel

mixtures, and the lean mixture operation can increase the fuel economy 
of the hydrogen-fueled engines. Moreover, its high diffusivity and flame 
speed  result  in  a  faster  uniform  fuel/air  mixture  and  an  improved 
combustion inside the cylinder [13,14]. The carbon-free structure of the 
hydrogen  also  makes  it  an  excellent  fuel  for  the  clean  and  efficient 
operation of IC engines. Fig. 1 shows the energy density of various fuels 
based on lower heating values (LHV) compared to hydrogen. As can be 
seen, hydrogen has nearly three times the energy content of gasoline on 
a mass basis. 

In contrast, hydrogen’s high auto-ignition temperature (858 K) ne-
cessitates the use of a spark plug or a supplementary low auto-ignition 
temperature fuel. On the other hand, its low ignition energy increases 
the propensity of phenomena like pre-ignition, backfire and knock. NOx 
emissions can also be increased due to the higher combustion temper-
atures associated with hydrogen combustion in IC engines [15]. 

Hydrogen can be produced in various ways to be stored in a pres-
surized tank on-board in a vehicle aiming at improving both combustion 
and aftertreatment processes [17]. The comparison of hydrogen usage in

stored liquid fuels on vehicles can mitigate many of the hydrogen stor-
age  and  combustion  challenges  [27–31],  and  this  will  be  extensively 
discussed in the upcoming sections. 

1.1. What is syngas? 

Syngas (an abbreviation for synthesis gas) can be derived by gasifi-
cation processes from natural gas, heavy oil, biomass, and coal (carbon- 
containing  fuels)  for  stationary  application  or  by  chemical  processes 
from  liquid  and  gaseous  fuels  for  vehicular  application,  in  which  a 
complex  and  long-chain  molecule  converts  to  simpler  molecules 
including H2  (hydrogen), CO (carbon monoxide), and CH4  (methane), 
CO2 (carbon dioxide), H2O (water vapor), and N2 (nitrogen). Based on 
the process adopted and the type of feedstock used, end-products as a 
form of syngas will have varying compositions and heating values, thus 
different  terms  such  as  “town  gas”,  “wood  gas”,  “water  gas”,  “producer 
gas”, “reformer gas”, “power gas”, and etc. have been used in the litera-
ture. A possible range for the volumetric composition of syngas is shown 
in  Table  2,  indicating  that  it  is  comprised  mainly  of  H2  and  CO.  The 
preferred  composition  generally  depends  upon  the  purpose  of  syngas 
usage,  feedstock,  and  production  cost.  For  example,  if  the  goal  is 
hydrogen production by a biomass gasification process, much more cost 
and  effort  are  needed  for  adequate  purification  than  the  reaction 
reforming process. 

Syngas can also be produced through fuel reforming with steam and/ 
or air using compact systems that can be located on-board a vehicle [27, 
33,34].  External  on-board  and  in-cylinder  fuel  reforming  techniques 
have been identified as possible pathways to produce syngas on-board in 
IC  engines  to  improve  efficiency  and  emissions  [33].  The  details  of 
on-board fuel reforming and syngas production will be covered in sec-
tion 4. 

1.2. Syngas applications 

Syngas can be used as an intermediate to create other attractive clean 
fuels  such  as  ammonia  (NH3),  dimethyl  ether  (DME),  and  methanol 
(CH3OH)  [35–39].  Another  use  of  syngas  is  as  a  primary  chemical 
building block in petrochemical and refining processes [40]. Syngas can 
be used in many different applications, including:  

• Power generation in existing coal power plants [22]  
• Combined heat and power (CHP) plants [41]  
• Integrated gasification combined cycles (IGCC) [42]  
• Fuel cells [43–46]  
• Production of transportation fuels from gas-to-liquid (GTL) processes 

[47]  

• Gas turbines [48–50]  
• Directly as the primary or secondary fuel in IC engines [51]

* The broad experimental studies of syngas-fed IC engines reviewed in sec-
tions 3 and 4 have been performed with simulated syngas whose H2/CO ratio 
can go beyond this value, i.e., H2/CO: 3/1 (by vol.). 

Fig. 1. Gravimetric and volumetric density of hydrogen and other fuels [16].  

vehicles through on-board hydrogen production, hydrogen storage, and 
stationary power generation systems is summarized in Table 1. The low 
ignition energy and volumetric energy density make storage of hydrogen 
on-board  a  challenging  task  [18,19].  Hydrogen  as  a  low-density  fuel 
needs to be compressed at high-pressure tanks (350–700 bar) to allow an 
adequate driving range of more than 500 km with safety and cost to be 
the  main  challenging  issues.  Difficulties  involved  in  the  storage  and 
transport  of  hydrogen  still  present  barriers  to  the  commercial  use  of 
hydrogen as a secondary or a main fuel for IC engines [19,20]. However, 
hydrogen is currently viewed as the most promising clean energy carrier 
of the future, and the hydrogen infrastructure is now rapidly expanding 
in many counties, both in the EU and outside. This has sparked research 
interest  in  the  energy  conversion  technologies,  particularly  fuel  cells 
that are capable of using hydrogen as the fuel [21]. 

While the merits of operating IC engines with varying concentrations 
of  hydrogen  have  been  well  documented  [25],  the  key  challenges 
remain  unresolved,  including  practical  approaches  to  hydrogen  pro-
duction  without  sacrificing  system  efficiency  and/or  sufficiently 
addressing its adverse combustion properties [26]. Syngas is considered 
an  intermediate  step  in  the  transition  from  carbon-based  fuels  to 
H2-based fuels, since it is composed mainly of hydrogen (H2) and carbon 
monoxide  (CO).  In  IC  engines,  using  syngas  produced  from  on-board

1.3. Syngas production methods 

Solid fuel (coal, biomass, wastes) feedstocks are sources for syngas 
production  [52,53]  by  traditional  gasification  methods  [54,55].  Also, 
liquid  and  gaseous  feedstocks  can  be  converted  to  syngas  by 
non-gasification methods [56] that comprise one or a chain of reforming 
processes using the catalysts; such processes are expected to be viable 
in-situ  methods  of  syngas  production  for  automotive  engines.  In  this 
section, only a brief review of different syngas production methods is 
presented since  several comprehensive review papers  [57,58] explain 
them in detail and emphasize the IC engine operation with gasification 
fuel [59,60] and non-gasification fuel [33]. 

1.3.1. Gasification processes 

Biomass gasification converts a solid fuel into syngas which can be 
burnt in stationary gas turbines and IC engines. Gasification is a ther-
mochemical  process  that  converts  a  solid  hydrocarbon  feedstock  like 
coal, petroleum coke, refinery residuals, biomass, and municipal solid 
waste, into syngas without consuming a large part of its heating value 
[58].  In  gasification,  the  carbon-containing  feedstock  reacts  with  a 
gasifying  agent  like  oxygen,  steam,  and  air,  which  breaks  down  the 
mixture into syngas, as illustrated in Fig. 2 [54,57,61,62]. The type and 
design of the gasifier, gasification temperature, type and flow rates of 
the feedstock  and oxidizing agents, and type and amount of catalysts 
[63], are the main parameters in influencing the gasification process and 
syngas  production  [64–70].  Oxygen  as  the  gasifying  agent  produces 
syngas called “medium syngas,” and if air is used, then it is called “pro-
ducer gas” [71]; the following sub-section will clarify the terms used in 
the rest of the paper. Using gasification methods, in addition to H2 and 
CO,  other  typical  products  including  H2O,  CO,  CH4,  unwanted  tars, 
small amounts of NH3, and H2S are also produced. The relative amount 
of each species depends on the feedstock and the gasification process 
[57].  Modeling  approaches  for  biomass  gasification  have  been  exten-
sively reviewed in [72]. 

For  syngas  production,  a  typical  solid  fuel  gasification  system 
coupled to spark ignition and dual-fuel diesel engines is illustrated in 
Fig. 3 [73]. The system includes a gasifier, a gas clean-up and cooling 
system, a gas mixer, a starting blower, and the engine. The engine draws 
air  from  the  gasifier  during  the  intake  stroke,  through  the  cleaning 
system, and from the gas mixer where air is combined with the syngas 
[74]. For example, Marculescu et al. [80] used food processing industry 
waste  for  energy  conversion,  using  gasification  and  an  IC  engine  for 

power generation. The biomass used consisted of bones and meat resi-
dues  sampled  directly  from  the  industrial  line,  characterized  by  high 
water content, about 42% in mass, and potential health risks. They re-
ported that syngas with a composition of 19.1%CO, 17%H2,  and 1.6% 
CH4 was produced. 

New gasification concepts such as dual fluidized bed gasifiers (DFBG) 
[76], plasma gasification [77–80], and supercritical water gasification 
[81,82],  have  demonstrated  the  potential  to  improve  syngas  quality 
from biomass gasification. However, they are not of significant interest 
at  present,  and  are  more  applicable  for  stationary  power  generation. 
Moreover, wood and solid fuels seem to be not effective for transport 
applications due to their low energy density. A further analysis on this 
topic is presented in section 3. 

1.3.2. Non-gasification processes 

Non-gasification  processes  include  catalytic  fuel  reforming,  where 
the  parent  fuel  reacts  with  steam  and/or  oxygen  in  a  heterogeneous 
process  to  produce  syngas  [27,83];  and  non-catalytic  processes  like 
plasma-assisted reforming [84]. The three main global reactions in fuel 
reforming  are  partial  oxidation  (POX),  steam  reforming  (SR),  and 
auto-thermal reforming (ATR) [47,85], which will be explained in the 
following. 

When a mixture of sub-stoichiometric oxygen and feedstock reacts to 
produce syngas, this self-sustaining chemical reaction is called “partial 
oxidation (POX),” It is an exothermic reaction. The complete combustion 
reaction forming CO2 is restricted due to insufficient O2 in the reactants 
[86,87].  In  endothermic  steam  reforming  (SR),  a  high-temperature 
mixture of fuel and steam is sent through a bed of catalyst. The heat 
required to drive the endothermic reaction is provided externally (e.g., 
electric  heaters  or  combustion  of  fuel).  The  syngas  stream  from  the 
steam reforming can then flow to a water gas shift (WGS) reactor, where 
additional  steam  converts  CO  to  CO2  and  generates  additional  H2 
[88–91]. 

When both the POX and SR reforming reactions are combined in a 
single reactor, it is called autothermal reforming (ATR). Industrially, the 
ATR reactor is implemented in a refractory-lined pressure vessel with a 
combustion chamber, burner, and catalyst bed. In this reactor, a sub- 
stoichiometric  environment  oxidizes  fuel,  natural  gas  in  most  cases, 
with O2. In the ATR reaction, POX provides heat for later SR reactions, 
thus controlling the exit temperature of the reactor. Endothermic dry 
reforming (DR) where the CO2 is reacting with hydrocarbons feedstock 
to create H2 and CO can also be employed [92–95]. The advantages and

disadvantages  of  these  processes  and  the  corresponding  chemical  re-
actions are summarized in Table 3 as main reforming reactions and in 
Table 4 as side reactions that may occur. These fuel reforming processes 
have  been  proposed  for  on-board  hydrogen-rich  gas  production  in 
vehicular applications, discussed in detail in section 4. Note that the goal 
is high hydrogen content; therefore, understanding the nature of these 
reactions  aids  us  in  deciding  which  reactions  should  participate  in 
reforming processes within a designed reactor and which ones to avoid. 

1.3.3. Syngas as an IC engine fuel 

Syngas as an IC engine fuel can be utilized in power generation and 
transportation,  produced  mainly  by  gasification  and  reforming  pro-
cesses,  respectively.  As  mentioned  above,  syngas  names  would  be 
different based on composition and LHV, while the terminology we use 
throughout the current work can be seen in Fig. 4, taken from IC engine- 
relevant  published  works.  It  is  worth  noting  that  the  figure  does  not 
encompass all viable routes for syngas production. 

As seen in the first row of Fig. 4, producer gas (PG) or low heating 
value  (LHV)  fuel  [59]  is  a  gasification  product  with  low  LHV  due  to 
using air as the gasifying agent and, therefore, the presence of high N2 
content  in  products.  With  steam  or  oxygen  or  a  combination  of  both 
utilized as the gasifying agent, the gasification product can be upgraded 
to fuel with a medium LHV. In general, the gasification process suffers 
from  low  thermal  efficiencies  (~  < 50%)  due  to  the  extra  step  of 
vaporizing the moisture contained in biomass and then from tar in the 
products  [101].  Noting  that  in  addition  to  gas  constituents,  tar  and 
residue  co-exist  in  the  end-product  of  gasification,  but  their  amounts 
reduce  as  high-temperature  steam  reforming  is  employed,  as  seen  in 
Fig.  5.  Thus,  gasification  fuel  presumably  creates  concerns  of  NOx 
emissions (due to probably high N2  content) and deposit formation in 
the combustion chamber, which should be considered when this fuel is 
being  used  as  an  IC  engine  fuel.  Several  IC  engine  related  studies, 
particularly with SI engines, with gasification fuels have been investi-
gated so far, which will be discussed in section 3. 

In  the  second  row  of  Fig.  5,  reformate  or  reformer  gas  (RG)  is  a 
reforming reaction product, which often has high H2  and CO contents 
with  negligible  N2  and  high  heating  value.  RG  can  be  economically 
produced  with  in-situ  methods,  which  will  be  discussed  partially  in 
section 3 (sub-sections of 3.2.2, and 3.3) and comprehensively in sec-
tion 4 (on-board fuel reforming technologies). 

The overall purpose  of using syngas  as a  primary  or secondary IC 
engine fuel is to benefit from renewable energy sources and clean power 
conversion technologies without scarifying efficiency, power derating, 
and pollutant emission formation of engines fueled with syngas [102, 
103]. However, its advantages are dependent on the physicochemical 
properties of syngas (i.e., the amount of CO and H2) (see section 2), the 
type  of  combustion  engine  (see  section  3),  and  the  fuel  reforming 
technique used for on-board syngas production (see section 4). 

1.4. Historical use of syngas as an engine fuel 

The first application of syngas in vehicles was reported in the 1920s 
when German engineer Georges Imbert developed a wood gas generator 
for automobile use [104]. The gases were cleaned and dried, and then 
fed into the vehicle’s combustion engine. Later, during World War II, 
shortages  of  petroleum  fuels  led  to  further  development  of  wood  gas 
vehicles  [105,106].  By  1945  syngas  was  used  for  trucks,  buses,  agri-
culture, energy generation, and industrial machinery. After the end of 
World  War  II,  the  application  of  syngas  was  changed  to  integrated 
gasification  combined  cycles  (IGCC)  for  stationary  power  generation. 
This could be due to less interest in syngas usage in IC engines related to 
the sharp drop in global oil price and intensified ambitions towards high 
power engines by increasing the anti-knock index (AKI) of gasoline fuel. 
The 1950s and 1960s are recalled as the “Power Wars” age [107]. The 
potential  of  syngas  production  and  application  in  a  low  compression 
ratio  SI  engine  fueled  with  a  syngas-methane  mixture  was  studied  in 

1956  by  Szezich  [108].  Later,  further  interest  in  biomass-based  fuel 
application  in  engines  was  sparked  by  the  oil crisis  in the  mid-1970s 
[109].  Simultaneously,  in  response  to  the  oil  price  shocks,  US 
Congress passed the first national standards for tailpipe-out emissions to 
increase miles per gallon (mpg) of passenger vehicles within ten years 
[110], which was the onset of adopting further stringent regulations for 
oil-based  fuels.  As  already  mentioned,  by  that  time,  syngas  use  was 
mainly limited to IGCC for stationary power generation [40,111,112], 
and as an intermediate to produce other biofuels [113,114]. 

◦

On  the  other  hand,  fuel  reforming  has  been  used  for  producing 
syngas  industrially  for  more  than  70  years  [115],  but  the  concept  of 
compact on-board reforming for engine applications dates back to the 
1970s [116]. Investigations carried out in 1973–1975 in the US with a 
Chevrolet  car  with  an  engine  equipped  with  a  syngas  generator 
demonstrated a decrease in petrol consumption by 26% when driving 
according  to  the  Federal  Drive  Cycle  CVS-3  [117].  On-board  fuel 
reforming was first practically applied to a carbureted gasoline engine 
through  a  project  named “Boston  Reformed  Fuel  Car”  by  Newkirk  and 
Abel  [118],  which  had  an  on-board  non-catalytic  system  operated  at 
higher than T = 1100 
C for the steam reforming reactions of gasoline. 
Martin [119] at the University of Arizona demonstrated a better concept 
of this project using a catalyst to reduce the temperature of the steam 
◦
reforming of gasoline to around T = 620 
C. In the meantime, Houseman 
and  Cerini [120]  from the  Jet Propulsion  Laboratory  (JPL)  evaluated 
on-board hydrogen generation by adding partial oxidation reforming to 
steam reforming along with the catalyst to perform the whole reforming 
process for both hydrocarbon and alcohol feedstocks fueled SI engine. A 
series of works from Lindstr¨om and Sj¨ostr¨om [121–123] at the Royal 
Institute of Technology (Sweden) was seemingly the first investigation 
on  directly  using  the  recirculated  exhaust  gases  as  the  primary  heat 
supplier for driving the endothermic reactions of the steam reforming 
process and as species that can participate in the reforming process. At 
the University of Birmingham, Jones [124,125] evaluated the feasibility 
of this concept as exhaust-gas reforming in more detail by incorporating 
the exhaust gases and using the entire fuel feedstock in the reforming 
process. For more reading on this topic, there are two notable reviews in 
the  literature  [126,127],  and  additional  discussions  are  provided  in 
section 4. 

The development of syngas-fueled IC engines was not commercial-
ized because of the low lifespan of the catalysts and tightening of NOx 
emission standards. However, research on syngas as a potential fuel for 
IC engines in transportation has gained much interest in recent decades 
with  advances  in  catalysts  and  the  potential  for  on-board  generation 
through waste heat recovery (WHR). An average of 30% substitution of 
fossil fuels by syngas has been proposed, based on extrapolating from the 
current EU Directives [128,129]. For further information, several review 
papers [27,51,59] and a book chapter [29] have been published on the 
historical and trends of syngas for power generation. 

1.5. Scope and structure of the current review 

There  are  many  studies  in  the  literature  on  the  use  of  syngas  in 
different types of IC engines, and it has been shown that syngas can be 
used  as  a  renewable  and  alternative  low-carbon  fuel  for  both  spark 
ignition  (SI)  and  compression  ignition  (CI)  engines  [130–133].  How-
ever,  there  are  still  numerous  subjects  such  as  on-board  syngas  pro-
duction and application in advanced combustion strategies that require 
further investigation and review. This work is focused on determining 
syngas’ potential as a renewable IC engine fuel in transportation. To do 
this:  

• Section 2 presents the fundamental physicochemical characteristics 
of  syngas,  which  ultimately  help  us  perceive  the  combustion 
behavior of syngas as an IC engine fuel under engine-relevant con-
ditions. Due to the composition variability of syngas, various H2/CO

• The  transition  from  syngas  as  an  IC  engine  fuel  to  syngas  as  a 
transportation fuel requires producing and carrying the syngas on- 
board a vehicle, such that both fuel economy and engine efficiency 
can  increase.  We  discuss  all  proposed  on-board  fuel  reforming 
technologies compatible with IC engine in section 4 to achieve these 
goals,  especially  paying  attention  to  waste  heat  recovery  (WHR) 
from engine exhaust. 

• The final section represents the summary and demonstrates sugges-
tions to make a feasible future for syngas as a transportation fuel. 

2. Fundamentals 

2.1. Physicochemical properties of syngas relevant to engines 

Table 5 lists the physicochemical properties of typical syngas mix-
tures compared to hydrogen, methane, biogas, and conventional fossil 
fuels. It is apparent that syngas has the highest laminar flame speed and 
widest flammability limits amongst all fuels after hydrogen, making it 
beneficial for application as a secondary fuel in IC engines, especially at 
low engine loads. It means that a wide range of stable operation (from 
rich to lean) could be achieved with syngas fuel, especially promoting 
the  ultra-lean  combustion  in  spark-ignition  engines.  The  volumetric 
energy  content  is  the  main  parameter  determining  the  fuel  injection 
system  design  and  required  storage  tank  for  vehicular  applications 
[134]. In the case of syngas use in IC engines, the fuel injection system 
size should be larger, or the injection duration should be longer. 

Although there is no available data for the minimum ignition energy 
of syngas mixtures, it can be concluded that the high hydrogen content 
in syngas could facilitate cold starts and guarantee rapid ignition [135], 
considering the unwanted ignitions, specifically pre-ignition and back-
fire (see sub-section 3.1.1). A scarcity in data has also continued for the 
quenching  distance,  and  a  lower  value  means  a  more  complete  com-
bustion [136], but with a higher heat transfer losses. 

Detailed combustion characteristics of syngas mixtures for gas tur-
bine engine-relevant conditions have already been reviewed by Lee et al. 
[137] and Jithin et al. [138]. In the following section, characteristics of 
the ignition delay times, laminar and turbulent flame speeds of syngas 
mixtures under engine-relevant conditions are reviewed and discussed 
with a focus on those aspects which have not been addressed carefully in 
previous reviews.

mixtures are considered in the first place, then the effects of diluents 
are discussed.  

• To better understand the effects of syngas on combustion, emissions, 
and  performance  of  IC  engines  with  conventional  and  advanced 
combustion strategies, section 3 reviews the syngas application in SI, 
HCCI and dual-fuel engines. In SI engine section, the power gener-
ation applications of the syngas-fueled engines are also included.

+ OH reaction. Those works were completely reviewed in [157,158]. 

Recently, in  order to justify  the observed discrepancies, Mansfield 
and Wooldridge [159] indicated two distinct ignition behaviors attrib-
uted  to  the  strong  (or  spontaneous  ignition  which  is  referred  to  as 
spatially  homogeneous  ignition)  and  mild  ignition  (or  deflagration 
ignition which is characterized by the onset of localized reaction sites) 
for a syngas, with a molar ratio of H2/CO = 0.7, mixed with air (O2/inert 
gas molar ratio = 1/3.76) at ϕ = 0.1 and 0.5, T = 870-1150 K, and p =
3-15.4  bar  through  high-speed  imaging  in  RCM  experiments.  Two 
high-speed imaging frames of that work are depicted in Fig. 7, in which 
multiple localized flame-like structures can be seen on the right side. The 
authors [159] indicated that the ignition behavior is weakly affected by 
the molar ratio of H2/CO, and, by comparison to other work [160], is not 
strongly  dependent  on  the  combustion  device  used,  albeit  strongly 
dependent on the initial thermodynamic state (i.e., pressure, tempera-
ture,  and  equivalence  ratio).  Also,  they  stated  that  the  mild  ignition 
behavior is not avoidable by reducing the equivalence ratio towards lean 
condition; however, the available chemical kinetics mechanisms used in 
the zero-dimensional (0-D) homogeneous reactor modelling would be 
capable of predicting the IDTs quite accurately. 

As mentioned earlier, a review by Lee [137] evaluated IDTs of syngas 
mixtures at different H2:CO ratios with different pressures ranging from 
1.6 to 49 atm, by collecting data from Krejci et al. [161,162], Mathieu 
et al. [163], Vasu et al. [164], Keromnes et al. [165], Gersen et al. [166], 
and Mittal et al. [152], as shown in Fig. 8. Relying on this review and 
related  works,  the  effects  of  various  parameters  on  IDTs  of  syngas 
mixtures are summarized below: 

Temperature and equivalence ratio (ϕ) effects: 
While increasing the temperature shortens the IDT substantially, the 
IDT of the various compositions of H2/CO syngas at lean equivalence 
ratios (ϕ) has a decreasing trend, but only at higher pressures, e.g., 49 
atm, as seen in Fig. 8(h). Conversely, at lower pressures, e.g., 7.9 atm, 
the IDTs can have an increasing trend by reducing the ϕ, which is the 
case of Fig. 8(b). 

Pressure effect: 
The influence of pressure on IDT of 50:50 H2:CO at ϕ = 1.6, and at p 
= 8, 12, and 32 atm are shown in Fig. 9 (left). The complex behavior of 
IDT can be seen with altering pressure at different temperature regions. 
At high temperatures (>1250 K), higher pressures significantly shorten 
the  IDT,  while  at  intermediate  temperatures  (1110  K<T<1250  K), 
increasing pressure from 1.6 to 32 atm exhibits a mild decreasing and 
even increasing decreasing trend for IDT, which implies that a compe-
tition  effect  may  exist.  Actually,  this  was  attributed  to  the  pressure 
dependence of H2 ignition [165], which is the competition between the 

Fig. 6. Discrepancies of ignition delay times between five homogenous reactor 
models’ predictions and three experimental datasets for syngas (H2/CO: 50/50, 
by vol.)/air mixture at ϕ  = 0.5 and p = 20.2 bar (Reprinted from [156] with 
permission of Elsevier). 

2.2. Ignition delay time (IDT) 

The ignition delay times, IDTs, of syngas mixtures were measured in 
earlier  studies  mostly  using  a  shock-tube  apparatus  confined  to  low 
pressure  (up  to  2.2  bar)  and  low-to-high  temperature (up  to  2850  K) 
conditions, which are less applicable to typical gas turbines and IC en-
gines operating conditions [144–150]. The emergence of advanced in-
tegrated system technologies like syngas-fired IGCC as an alternative to 
conventional  coal-fired  power  plants,  together  with  reported  discrep-
ancies between measurements and reaction model predictions of IDTs of 
syngas  mixtures  (see  Fig.  6),  has  provoked  researchers  to  reproduce 
experimental measurements and refine the reaction kinetics for syngas 
oxidation at higher pressures and temperatures [151,152]. Thus, some 
later studies were conducted using rapid compression machines (RCM) 
[152–154] and  shock-tubes [155,156] at higher  pressures,  suggesting 
that the observed discrepancies between measured and calculated IDTs 
at these pressures are due to not considering the overall activation en-
ergy 
the 
chain-propagation regime, and particularly the role of CO + HO2 = CO2

chain  branching reaction  (H + O2  →  O + OH) that dominates in the 
high-temperature  region,  and  the  pressure-dependent  propagation  re-
action  (H  + O2(+M)  →  HO2(+M)) 
the 
low-temperature region. Moreover, the latter reaction is more favorable 
at high pressures and is also pressure-dependent, inhibiting the chain 
branching and resulting in longer IDT at elevated pressures, as seen in 
Fig. 9 (right). 
CO effect: 
Though the H2-chemistry is dominant at low CO content, the CO has 
an inhibiting effect on the IDTs of H2/CO fuel due to the decrease in 
activation energy. Lower activation energy can be detected in the high- 
temperature  region,  followed  by  a  very steep  increase  at  around  T  =
1000 K. The inhibition effect is much more prominent as pressure in-
creases  from  ~15  to  30  bar;  that  is,  the  CO  oxidation  is  retarded  by 
increasing pressure. Beyond p=30 bar, the incremental variation in the 
inhibiting effect would be trivial. These mentioned trends can be seen in 
the  labeled  pictures  of  (a),  (c),  (e),  and  (g)  in  Fig.  8.  For  high  H2 

concentration (i.e., CO < 60%), adding CO to H2 did not lead to a sig-
nificant increase in IDT, as shown by Gersen et al. [166] (see Fig. 8 (a)). 
Further discussions regarding the CO’s inhibiting effect have been re-
ported in [152,166]. 

CH4 effect: 
Under  engine-relevant  conditions,  it  has  been  reported  [167–169] 
that the addition of H2  has ignition-promoting effect in CH4  mixtures, 
with  substantially  reduced  IDT  by  replacing  CH4  with  a  50%  mole 
fraction of H2, particularly at higher temperatures. For the purpose of 
IDT measurement in CH4/H2/CO/oxidizer mixtures, Gersen et al. [166] 
carried out experiments and calculations at ϕ = 0.5 and 1, p = 20-80 bar, 
and  T  = 900-1100  K  conditions  using  an  RCM  and  the  SENKIN  code 
[170].  With  the  addition  of  CH4  (> 50%  by  mole  fraction)  to  the 
H2/CO-oxidizer mixture, CO, with low mole fraction (≤ 30%), had no 
inhibiting effect on either IDTs of CH4/H2/CO or CH4/CO, while CH4 
had this effect, particularly at high temperatures, as illustrated in Fig. 10 
(a). In contrast to CO, CH4 with an even low mole fraction (~ 6%) in the

fuel showed an ignition-inhibiting effect due to OH consumption by CH4 
+ OH = CH3  + H2O, as can be seen from Fig. 10 (b); noting that the 
ignition stage is depicted as a two-step ignition process, i.e., τign1 and τ 
ign2, due to the presence of two separate regions of fast pressure increase 
on the recorded pressure-time history plot. This behavior has not been 
explicitly  reported  before  [171]  for  syngas  fuel  mixtures. The  experi-
mental works measuring IDTs of syngas mixtures under engine-relevant 
conditions are summarized in Table 6. 

There have been several correlations proposed in the literature for 
IDT calculation, which can provide a means to estimate syngas ignition 
properties  in  a  simplified  form,  where  detailed  kinetic  models  are 
computationally  expensive.  Walton  et  al.  [154]  performed  ignition 
studies of simulated syngas mixtures of H2, CO, O2, N2, and CO2  in an 
RCM. The IDT data spanned pressures between p = 7.1-26.7 bar, tem-
peratures from T = 855-1051 K, equivalence ratios from ϕ  = 0.1-1.0, 
oxygen mole fractions from 15% to 20% and H2:CO ratios from 0.25 to 
4.0 (molar basis). Regression analysis yielded the following best-fit to 

the data set:

In this correlation, τign denotes the ignition delay time [ms], p pres-
sure [bar], T temperature [K], φ the equivalence ratio, and χO2  the ox-
ygen mole fraction. The experimental data were also in good agreement 
with model predictions based on the detailed mechanism proposed by 
Davis [151]. 

As a final note, it is also important to study ignition delay times of 
syngas blended with other gases such as CO2, and H2O, since syngas is 
not suitable as a sole fuel for some type of IC engines (as will be dis-
cussed  in  section  3).  The  effects  of  diluents  like  H2O  [163,173],  CO2 
(negligible)  [163],  impurities  (e.g.,  trimethylsilanol)  [171]  and  NH3 
(negligible) [163] on IDT of syngas mixtures have been studied in only a 
few studies. It was suggested that H2O has contradictory impacts on the 
IDTs  under  various  pressures,  increasing  IDT  at  high  pressures  as

HO2/H2O2  reactions  become  more  profound,  thereby  increasing  the 
reactivity of the mixture [173]. Although substantial progress has been 
obtained in our awareness of IDT for H2/CO syngas, there are still few 
studies to achieve a general description for a representative H2/CO/di-
luents/(possible) impurities syngas under engine-relevant conditions. 

2.3. Methane number (MN) 

In the IC engine community, to isolate the knock propensity of the 
fuel from the specific engine design and condition, a practical measure 
was required to indicate the ability of a fuel to resist knock [174]. Due to 
this, octane number is defined, and some octane rating methods like the 
motor octane number (MON) have been established by ASTM for liquid 
fuels based on primary reference fuel blends, in which iso-octane-like 
fuel is assigned with ON (or MON) of 100 and n-heptane-like fuel with 
ON  (or  MON)  of  0;  which  means  fuels  with  high  MON  resist 
auto-igniting more than those with low MON. Extending this concept to 
gaseous fuels leads to the so-called methane number (MN), taken from 
the work done for the Austrian AVL Company through 1964-1969 [175]. 
The system rating of MN employs a reference fuel blend of methane and 
hydrogen, by which methane and hydrogen are given to MN of 100 and 
zero, respectively. CH4-CO2 mixtures were also considered as reference 
mixtures for MN beyond 100, defining 100 plus the volume of existing 
CO2 for MON; for example, 20%CO2 + 80%CH4 (by vol.) results in MON 
of 120 while 20%H2 + 80%CH4 (by vol.) leads to MON of 80. Therefore, 
it is expected that an engine fueled with a syngas fuel having a higher 
CO2 fraction leads to a rise in the upper limit of compression ratio (CR) 
without knock issue. More generally, once the MN number through this 
method  is  determined,  regulating  both  spark  timing  and  CR  can  be 
employed to avoid knock, applicable to an engine fueling with either 
100% syngas or syngas blended with other gaseous fuels. To determine 
the  MN,  some  researchers  [176–179]  have  conducted  their  own  pro-
cedure and compared it to developed MN programs, such as the AVL 
Methane program V3.20 [180] and the MWM MN program [181], which 
are partly looked at in the following. 

Generally,  the  procedure  for  specifying  the  MN  of  tested  fuel  is 
basically  a  comparative  basis  in  which  unknown  fuel  is  indirectly 
compared  to  a  map  of  reference  blends  at  the  same  CR  via  a  curve; 
however, this subject is out of scope for the current review and can be 
found  elsewhere  [182,183].  As  an  alternative  approach  for  indirectly 

comparing  the  tested  fuels  to  reference  blends,  Malenshek  and  Olsen 
[182]  conducted  a  direct  comparison  by  developing  a  test  procedure 
with a computer-controlled gas blending system, minimizing the effects 
of other uncontrolled variables besides CR, such as ambient temperature 
and atmospheric pressure, and producing maximum knock by sweeping 
the air-fuel ratio (rather than ϕ=1 for indirect comparison). Some results 
for a wide range of syngas composition are presented in Table 7. 

Experimental data, such as that represented in Table 7, were used in 
the  literature  to  compare  with  the  programs  that estimate  the  MN  of 
natural gas as a function of its composition. It was found that estimates 
can deviate considerably with respect to experimental data when syngas 
is considered as fuel [183]. These deviations are mainly caused by the 
various  and  high  concentrations  of  carbon  monoxide,  and  especially 
carbon  dioxide  (as  a  knock  suppressor)  and  hydrogen  (as  a  knock 
propagator) in syngas. The other reason, for example, for early version 
of  AVL  program  was  that  carbon  monoxide  effects  are  not  included 
[177].  Diaz  et  al.  [177]  carried  out  a  comprehensive  analysis  of  the 
auto-ignition  tendency  of  binary  mixtures  of  hydrogen  and  carbon 
monoxide  diluted  with  carbon  dioxide.  They  proposed  a  statistically 
validated second-order regression model to predict MN. Results revealed 
that increasing carbon dioxide concentration in the mixtures strongly 
increases the MN of the mixtures. A great fraction of H2 and CO intensely 
reduces the MN, whereas the CO2 or N2 raise knock resistance and thus 
increase the MN [176]. Lechner et al. [184] showed that the classical 
methane number or the propane knock index1  fail for the syngas com-
positions in practice. Based on a review of published fuel data, 31 gas 
mixtures were developed using a D-optimal statistical design consisting 
of H2, CO, CH4, CO2, and higher hydrocarbons up to C3. Additionally, 
pure  methane,  pure  propane,  pure  hydrogen  and  a  biogas  mixture 
consisting of 60 vol% CH4 and 40 vol% CO2 were examined as reference 
fuels.  Practically  all  syngas  blends  were  more  prone  to  knock  than 
methane or biogas. Admixtures of higher hydrocarbons were found to 
substantially increase the knock propensity. This indicates the promi-
nent role of higher hydrocarbons with regard to the knock propensity of 
fuel gases. Lean equivalence ratios, exhaust gas recirculation, and the 
addition of water vapor were effective measures to mitigate the risk of 
knock. 

Under  the  MN  determination,  hydrogen  should  have  the  lowest 
resistance to knocking, which somehow is not true since some work has 
presented a research octane number (RON) of around 130 for hydrogen. 
Also, hydrogen and methane as reference fuels in the MN rating system 
have very different characteristics in flame speeds and ignition delays, in 
contrast  to  those  in  the  ON  rating  system,  which  have  similar  flame 
speeds [185]. It was seen that the MN could be correlated to the adia-
batic flame temperature and laminar flame speed, a high MN fuel having 
a  low  adiabatic  flame  temperature  and  long  flame  initiation  period 
[176].  However,  compared  to  H2,  propane  (C3H8)  has  shown  more 
knock  tendency,  which  may  stem  from  its  lower  auto-ignition 
temperature. 

To summarize, there is still no comprehensive consensus to deter-
mine  the  knock  propensity  of  gaseous,  namely  syngas  fuels.  The 
currently potential errors in the MN method, such as various operating

engine conditions and heavy hydrocarbon presence in syngas, lead to 
keep investigating this matter. 

2.4. Laminar flame speed (LFS) 

Laminar flame speed is a crucial parameter, which results from the 
net effects of the diffusivity, exothermicity, and reactivity of the mixture 
[186], and has a strong dependency on pressure, temperature, mixture 
composition, and equivalence ratio [187]. The LFS of syngas-air mix-
tures  at  typical  temperatures  and  pressures  (NTP)  conditions  were 
extensively  reported  in  [188–194],  and  Fig.  11  shows  an  example  of 
published  data  for  LFS  of  a  syngas  mixture  (H2/CO:  5/95  by  vol.)  at 
atmospheric and high-pressure conditions. As can be seen, a relatively 
decent consistency in measured LFS values can be observed among all 
data,  with  a  maximum  variance  of  10  cm/s  peak-to-peak,  while  the 
difference was seen to be larger as pressure increases. 

Moreover, the discrepancies among measured LFS data are as high as 
40 cm/s at fuel-rich conditions (ϕ > 2) by increasing H2 concentration 
by  just  10%.  Fig.  12  shows  that  the  maximum  LFS  value  increases 
approximately from 65 in Fig. 11 to 130 cm/s by substituting 20% of CO 
with H2 in the syngas mixture. This can be attributed to the wide range 
of  data  sets  used  for  extrapolation2  (to  eliminate  stretch  effects  from 
data), the applied stretch extrapolation model, the chosen flame radius 
range, and the inhibiting effect of carbonyl compounds coming from the 
steel containers utilized to store the CO content of syngas. More infor-
mation  on  fundamentals  and  technical  possible  sources  of  observed 
discrepancies  and  uncertainties  are  described  in  [187]  and  [197]  for 
each  distinct  fuel-air mixture, and  in [198]  for spherically expanding 
syngas flames. 

For the high-pressure operating condition, Sun et al. [196] were one 
of the first groups that conducted the LFS measurement of H2/CO mix-
tures at pressures up to p=40 atm. They substituted nitrogen (N2) with 
helium  (He)  to  increase  the  Lewis  number  (Le)  of  the  mixture,  mini-
mizing flame-front instability3 due to wrinkling and cell formation over 
the flame surface. It is also noteworthy that if the ignition energy sup-
plied by the spark plug of a SI engine is not enough to drive the flame 
front to a minimum radius at which stretch effects are decreased, the 
propagating flame of a mixture with Le>1 can extinguish [199]. Refer-
ring back to Fig. 11 and now to Fig. 13 (left) for pressures higher than 
p=10  atm,  it  is  obvious  that  increasing  initial  pressure  substantially 
reduces  LFS,  which  is  attributed  to hydrodynamic  instabilities due  to 
decrease in flame thickness as seen in Fig. 13 (right). Some studies are 
available concerning the LFS of syngas mixtures at higher pressure [162, 
165,194-196, 200,201]; most of them used helium rather than nitrogen. 
High-H2 syngas, the target fuel for IC engines, is more susceptible to 
flame  front instabilities,  taken from  LFS of  pure H2-oxidizer  mixtures 
[19].  Both  thermal-diffusive  and  hydrodynamic  instabilities  are 
involved in amplifying the flame front’s destabilization by affecting the 
Lewis number and flame thickness, respectively. So, as compared with 
CO, H2 has a more dominant effect on flame stabilities [202]. To mea-
sure LFS of syngas with H2/CO: 85:15% (by vol.) at elevated pressures 
up to p = 10 bar and lean conditions (ϕ = 0.5-0.6), which is relevant to 
IC engines with premixed charge, Goswami et al. [203] conducted ex-
periments using the heat-flux method and then compared the resulting 
LFSs with those obtained from the available mechanisms [165,204-206] 
by  kinetic  modeling.  They  observed  significant  differences  between 
experiment and modeling, attributed to the uncertainty in key reactions, 
and  suggested  that  further  studies  are  requisite  to  modify  their  rate 

2  To correctly determine the LFS, particularly in spherical propagating flame 
at  elevated  pressures,  stretch  effects  due  to  flame  curvature  and  flame  un-
steadiness should be subtracted from experimental data to avoid scattering the 
data. Stretch effects can be eliminated by using non- and linear extrapolation 
equations. 

3  Two common intrinsic flame instabilities have been pointed out within the 
present work, the thermo-diffusivity instability that is characterized by Lewis 
number and the hydrodynamic (as known as the Darrieus-Landau) instability, 
which is due to density jump across the flame-front, that is characterized by the 
flame thickness and thermal expansion ratio.

constants. Later,  Zhang  et  al.  [207]  studied the  LFS of  the  same  lean 
high-H2  syngas  of  the  previous  study  [203]  at  elevated  pressures  but 
using the spherical flame method. Fig. 14 depicts that the measured LFS 
is seen to diminish monotonically as pressure increases, due to the fact 
that SL ~ p(n/2(cid:0) 1) [197] and the overall order of reaction n is normally 
less than 2, due to the third body, inhibiting the H + O2 + M → HO2 + M 
reaction. As can be seen from Fig. 14,  while mechanisms have better 
predicted the results of the latter study compared to that of the former 
study, the reason is unclear and needs additional study. In addition, the 
preferential diffusivity of high-H2 syngas must be noted here due to the 
high mass diffusivity of H2 [19], as it plays a vital role in the future of 
flame front structure [208]. Interestingly, at elevated pressures and lean 
conditions but lower H2 content (35:65 H2:CO mixtures), syngas laminar 
flames  were  determined  [209]  to  be  extremely  unstable,  resulting  in

is almost impossible to obtain accurate LFSs before the onset of flame 
instabilities at lean and elevated pressure conditions [210]. 

Based  on  the  above  discussions  and  Refs.  [211,212],  it  is  worth 
noting that lean high-H2  syngas (H2/CO) flames at elevated pressures 
tend to wrinkle and exhibit cellularity even at the early stage of kernel 
development. Such unstable cellular flames can be self-accelerated by

gradually increasing their frontal surface area, and, thus, this should be 
noted as a reason for knocking combustion in SI engines. Both intrinsic 
flame instabilities and the acceleration characteristic of the flame front, 
at decreased critical (minimum) flame radius, result in more difficulties 
in accurately measuring the LFS. Accordingly, Xie et al. [211] proposed 
an updated method, based on Bradley et al. [213], to obtain the LFS at 
various  flame  radii  without  the  acceleration  effect.  Identification and 
characterization  of  self-acceleration  of  syngas  flame  are  still  in  their 
infancy and an ongoing topic for research. 

As H2/CO mixtures do not represent real syngas and always refer to 
bottled gas or simulated gas, the effect of dilutions with CO2, N2, H2O, at 
least on LFS of H2/CO mixtures must be investigated by scrutinizing the 
thermal, chemical, and transport impacts of each of them. It has been 
separately  reported  in  [195,200,202,214,215]  that  CO2  decreases  the 
flame temperature, thereby reducing the rate of H2/CO oxidation and 
thus the LFS, which means the chemical effect of CO2 is dominating. Han 
et al. [200] measured the LFS of H2/CO (3/1, 1/1, and 1/3 by vol.) with 
CO2 dilution for elevated pressures p=1, 4, and 10 bar and temperatures 
T=298, 375, and 450 K using the outward spherical flame propagation 
method, and indicated that increasing CO2  dilution linearly decreases 
the  LFS and  directly  affects  the  elementary  reaction  rates.  A  compre-
hensive study by Vu [202] revealed that CO2- and N2-diluted syngas-air 
flames  are  more  sensitive  to  stretch  effects  than  a  He-diluted  one 
because of the reduced Markstein number with increasing diluent con-
centrations. Also, from Fig. 15, it can be seen that the effective Lewis 
number (defined as a combination of fuel and oxidizer Lewis numbers) is 
reduced in both cases of CO2 and N2 dilution and will be more prone to 
thermo-diffusive instability at lean conditions; according to such trend, 
Parthap et al. [214] showed the minimum permissible quantity of the 
equivalence ratio to achieve flame stability would be shifted from 0.6 to 
0.8 for increasing CO2  concertation from 0 to 30%, respectively, for a 
H2/CO: 1/1 (by vol.) mixture. A recent study [216] showed that for a 
diluted  H2/CO  mixture,  the  flame  would  be  more  stabilized  by 
increasing ϕ when the H2 fraction is more than 50%. Also, it was shown 
that the flame instability of high-H2 syngas (as H2/CO mixture) scarcely 
varies  with  increasing  CO2  or  N2  dilution  fraction  compared  to  a 
high-CO syngas whose flame becomes more stable with rising dilution. 
While  decreasing  LFS  with  both  CO2  and  N2  addition  has  been 
proven [217–222], syngas-air mixtures have higher LFS with N2  dilu-
tion,  which  has  a  thermally  dominant  impact  [222].  Therefore, 
increasing CO2 dilution has a more substantial inhibiting effect on LFS 
due to its direct engagement in the chemical reactions through CO + OH 
↔ CO2 + H [214,223], and hence it is necessary to evaluate it with more 
caution in predicting syngas containing CO2 by a reaction model. 

The LFSs of H2O diluted syngas-air mixtures have been explored by 
some researchers at atmospheric conditions using both stagnation [224] 
and spherical [193] flame methods, consistently concluding that H2O 
addition will non- and monotonically reduce the LFS of CO- and H2-rich 
syngas, respectively. For higher pressures up to p=10 bar, Santner et al. 
[225] found a monotonic drop in mass burning rate with increasing H2O 
concentration for an equimolar H2/CO syngas. Besides, they indicated 
that  the  inhibitory  effect  of  H2O  addition  would  be  increased  with 
increasing pressure.  In a  research on CH4  blended with  H2/CO,  Zhou 
et  al.  [226]  conducted  measurements  and  numerical  simulations  at 
Tin=303  K,  ϕ  = 0.6–1.5  and  p  = 0.1–0.5  MPa  with  a  wide  range  of 
bio-syngas  (H2/CO/CH4)  compositions.  They  experimentally  deter-
mined  and  measured  LFS  of  premixed  bio-syngas/air  flames  under 
various compositions of fuel mixtures, as depicted in Fig. 16, in which 
αBasis, as a base for comparison, is set to H2/CO/CH4 = 40/40/20 (% by 
vol.)  with  constant  mole  ratios  among  species;  and  αH2-60  equals 
H2/CO/CH4  = 60/26.6/13.3.  It  was  observed  that  the  Li  mechanism 
[204]  is  well  in  line  with  the  measured  LFS  of  premixed  bio-syngas 
flames, particularly under fuel-lean conditions. There is a slight differ-
ence  between  the  expected  findings  and  the  experimental  ones  for

fuel-rich conditions. 

It can also be seen in Fig. 16 that the peak value of LFS moves to-
wards fuel-rich conditions with increasing H2 content in the mixture due 
to  the  very  high  diffusivity  of  hydrogen  [227],  which  has  a  severe, 
increasing trend with ϕ. Conversely, the addition of CH4 to the mixture 
leads  to  shifting  the  peak  value  to  the  lean  side  with  a  quite  large 
reduction in the quantity of LFS due to the inherent slower LFS of CH4. 
Also, with an increase in CO fraction in the fuel, the LFS is not much 
influenced.  The thermal and chemical kinetic analysis shows that the 
addition of CO has much more impact on the adiabatic flame tempera-
ture but plays a minor role in its chemical kinetic impact as opposed to 
the addition of H2 [228]. The influence of H2 addition to LFS is mainly 
due to its chemical effect at lean and stoichiometric conditions. How-
ever, with the addition of around 75% CO, the rise in laminar flamma-
bility  is  attributed  to  the  high  adiabatic  flame  temperature  (thermal 
effect) [229]. 

The  effects  of  inert  gases  like  N2,  CO2,  and  H2O,  and  CH4  on  the 
laminar  flame  speeds  of  syngas,  in  the  form  of  H2/CO,  were  briefly 
reviewed here and are extensively discussed in [137,230]. The LFS of 
syngas  in the  form of  producer gas  (PG) have also  been addressed  in 
[231–235], which is the case of 100% syngas fueled IC engines in sta-
tionary  applications. Monteiro et  al. [234] investigated  the impact of 
various compositions of PG generated through fluidized bed, updraft, 
and  downdraft  gasification  on  the  LFS,  using  the  spherical  flame 
method. Fig. 17 illustrates that the LFS of two studied PG over a wide 
range of ϕ have a similar trend to those of syngas with high CH4 content, 
although the maximum values are at stoichiometric conditions. Tippa 
et al. [236,237], concluded that PG combustion with higher H2, CO, and 
N2 fractions and comparatively lesser amounts of CH4 and CO2 are stable 
to  preferential  diffusion  effects  and  predictable  for  minor  changes  in 
composition. 

Other researchers have tried to determine the LFS of syngas blended 
with hydrocarbon fuels [238–240] and with exhaust gas recirculation 
(EGR)  [241,242],  which  is  the  primary  case  in  syngas  fueled  engines 
through reforming fuel on-board a vehicle, of which detailed discussions 
can be found in sections 3 and 4.  For instance, Kwon and Min [238] 
calculated  the  LFS  of  syngas/iso-octane-air  mixtures  by  a  1-D  model 
under  conditions  relevant  to  SI  engines.  The  EGR  effect  was  also 
included using different fractions of burnt gas up to 0.5 in volume. The 
LFS  of  the  studied  mixtures  were  observed  to  be  proportional  to  the 
initial temperature, LHV, the fraction of syngas in the fuel mixture and 
H2  fraction  in  the  syngas,  and  inversely  proportional  to  the  initial 
pressure, deviation of equivalence ratio from the stoichiometric condi-
tion, and the fraction of burnt gas. A few studies have also considered the 
combustion  characteristics of  syngas  mixtures in  premixed  SI  engines 
[73,243,244].  However,  the  extent  of  accuracy  and  reliability  in  the 

results  of  such  studies  are  vastly  dependent  on  the  capability  of  the 
developed  reaction  mechanisms  in  predicting  the  LFS  under  desired 
simulation conditions. 

Finally, measured LFS data can establish correlations [245], which is 
a simpler and more convenient approach than detailed simulations with 
kinetic mechanisms, for easy use in estimating the LFS of syngas-based 
mixtures during engine combustion simulations [191]. However, those 
are only applicable to regions far away from stretch and ignition energy 
effects. An example of the kind of LFS correlation is given below, which 
is a function of equivalence ratio, temperature, and pressure [194]:

where Su0 is the reference LFS at certain point (ϕ = 1, T0 = 298.15 K, p0 
=1  bar),  ϕ  the  equivalence  ratio,  T  the  temperature  in  K  and  p  the 
pressure of the mixture in bar. The fitting coefficients, a, b, c, and d were 
obtained for different hydrogen concentrations using a nonlinear, least- 
squares method. This correlation is valid only for non-cellular laminar 
flames within the equivalence ratio range of 0.6 < ϕ < 5. The pressure 
and  temperature  ranges  are  a  function  of  the  equivalence  ratio  and 
hydrogen fraction. 

Semi-empirical correlations are also available to predict the LFS of 
H2/CO/air flames with N2  and CO2  dilution [246]. Although such cor-
relations  are  preferred  to  comprehensive  chemical  kinetic  models  in 
terms of computational cost, they have been restricted to specific con-
ditions,  beyond  which  the  predictions  are  inaccurate.  This  is  because 
many  earlier  correlations  were  based  on  a  small  collection  of  experi-
mental data, mostly carried out over a narrow range of engine operating 
conditions [73,191,196,238,245,247,248]. In addition, no flame speed 
correlation is available that allows the calculation of LFS for blends of 
syngas and gaseous fuels. For gaseous blends, blending has a non-linear 
effect  on  the  LFS,  resulting  in  complicated  mathematical  correlation 
equations to capture this behavior [249]. Therefore, the use of reaction 
kinetics  calculations  is  preferred  for  the  combustion  study  of 
syngas-fueled engines. With this in mind, data-driven machine learning 
(ML)  algorithms  [250],  as  a  more  recent  solution,  can  be  trained  to 
overcome this issue based on a large dataset having high accuracy to 
anticipate the LFS of syngas with large fluctuations in their composition 
at  various  conditions.  This  approach  also  allows  more  researchers  to 
participate  in  developing  syngas-based  combustion  systems  without 
requiring the in-depth knowledge that only qualified experts have. 

In summary, instabilities induced by high H2-containing syngas at 
elevated pressures  make LFS measurements  with reasonable accuracy 
impossible. In general, with an increase in pressure and concentration of 
H2, the LFSs for premixed H2/CO-oxidizer mixtures reduce and increase, 
respectively. Diluting syngas with N2, CO2, or H2O decreases the LFS. 
The  maximum  flame  speed  occurs  at  fuel-rich  conditions,  while  the 
maximum flame temperature occurs near the stoichiometric condition. 
Also,  the LFS  has shown a  strong  dependency  on pressure,  inlet tem-
perature, and equivalence ratio. It was shown that extensive modifica-
tions  in  kinetic  mechanisms  should  be  taken  into  account. There  is  a 
broad  experimental  data  collection  available  in  the  literature  for  the 
combustion of syngas with various concentrations of H2:CO. Nonethe-
less, research on syngas mixed with other gases such as CO2 and H2O is 
still limited, and a few experimental data are available for the LFS of 
syngas mixed with CH4  at elevated pressures [158,195,239,251]. New 
measurements with thorough uncertainty analysis on the LFS of syngas 
(H2/CO + diluents) solely and blended with other fuels (like gasoline, 
diesel,  etc.),  which  are  of  great  interest  in  vehicular  applications  at 
elevated pressures and engine-relevant conditions, will help us to un-
derstand syngas combustion behavior properly.

2.5. Turbulent flame speed (TFS) 

Like the LFS, the turbulent flame speed (TFS), ST, is of interest and is 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience90(2022)10099516A. Paykani et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                

defined when the surface area of thin laminar flames interacting with 
the turbulent flow is increased. Unlike LFS that exclusively depends on 
mixture properties, TFS is also a function of turbulent flow, enclosed by 
the  IC engine geometry. So, measuring TFS is  sensitive to the experi-
mental  rig  used,  and  it  was  confirmed  [252,253]  that  it  is  an 
experiment-dependent variable. Turbulent spherical flames propagating 
inside  the  IC  engine  consume  the  unburned  mixture  when  the 
flame-front  enters  to  reaction  zones,  thereby  determining  the  heat 
release  rate.  From  an  engine  viewpoint,  TFS  is  dependent  on 
trapped-mass conditions, residual turbulence at trapping, and the mean 
piston  speed,  while  processes  such  as  auto-ignition,  combustion,  and 
heat  conduction  are  also  affected  [254].  Generally,  Lipatnikov  and 
Chomiak  [253]  demonstrated  that  flame  stretch  and  instability  could 
significantly  affect  TFS,  depending  on  the  conditions  and  mixture 
properties. 

Because of high stretch sensitivity due to the high mass diffusivity of 
H2  content  [255],  the  turbulent  flame  properties  of  model  syngas 
(H2/CO) mixtures are of great importance and interest. A few helpful 
experimental measurements on the H2/CO-air mixtures have been car-
ried  out  under  elevated  pressures,  such  as  those  by  stabilized 
Bunsen-type flames [256–259] and centrally-ignited propagating flames 
[209,260]. The findings of several flame configurations suggested that 
the TFS of lean hydrogen flames are around a factor of two faster than 
those  of  hydrocarbon  flames,  although  their  magnitudes  vary  signifi-
cantly for various flame geometries [29]. Regarding measuring the TFS 
of  syngas-air  mixtures  in  high-pressure  environments,  the  two  most 
discussed topics in the literature are: 

1- The impact of pressure increase, fuel composition, flame-front sen-

sitives, and ReT on TFS.  

2-  Extracting  ST  correlations  from  experimental  data  for  a  particular 

fuel-air mixture at specific conditions and generalizing them.

Herein, the turbulent Reynolds number is defined as ReT = (u

, l0 and ν are the turbulent intensity or root-mean-square (r.m.s) 
where u
turbulent fluctuating velocity, the integral length scale, and the kine-
matic viscosity of the reactants, respectively. In the first topic, the in-
fluence of pressure, two scenarios have been reported to date. The first 
states  that  the  TFS  increases  with  increasing  pressure  due  to  the 
′
improvement of flame instabilities, at constant u
andl0, regardless of the 
fact that ReT also increases due to the inverse proportion of ν to pressure 
elevation.  However,  the  second  proved  that TFS  decreases,  similar  to 
LFS in a negative exponential behavior, with increasing pressure as the 
ReT is held constant [260,261]. 

As  instances  of  the  first  scenario,  Liu  et  al.  [209]  studied  TFS  for 
35:65  H2:CO-air  mixtures  at  ϕ  = 0.5  and  0.7  over  an  initial  pressure 
range  of  p  = 1–10  bar.  They  found  that  ST  increases  with  increasing 
pressure (ST~p0.15 for ϕ = 0.7 and ST~p0.11 for ϕ = 0.5) at a fixed r.m.s 
′ ≈ 1.4 m/s), often attributed to cellular 
turbulent fluctuating velocity (u
instability  promotion  due  to  thinner  flame  thickness  (hydrodynamic 
instability) [253,262]. At higher pressure up to 20 bar, Daniele et al. 
[257]  mentioned  that  the  ST  increase  is  because  of  diffusive-thermal 
instability  co-acting  with  hydrodynamic  impact.  Additionally,  it  was 
′
demonstrated that increasing u
/SL is much more effective in increasing 
ST/SL  than  increasing  pressure,  particularly  in  the  weak  turbulence 
regime.  Besides  the  pressure  influence,  the  increase  of  ST/SL  with 
increasing hydrogen fraction in syngas (H2/CO) mixtures was observed 
using  OH-PLIF  measurements  in  a  work  by  Wang  et  al.  [263], which 
resulted in the promotion of the intensity of flame front wrinkles due to 
amplified preferential diffusive-thermal instability. In addition to results 
consistent  with  prior  studies,  Venkateswaran  et  al.  [264]  displayed 
measured quantities of ST for 90:10 H2:CO that are around three times 
larger than for CH4  blends, with the same SL,u
, and operating condi-
tions. An important conclusion from the work of the same authors [255] 
was  that  fuel  effects  on  ST  are  not  simply  a  low  turbulence  intensity 
phenomenon  –  it  clearly  persists  over  the  entire  range  of  turbulence 

′

intensities used in the measurements. It is believed that these fuel effects 
are due to the reactant mixture’s stretch sensitivity, which has a strong 
effect on the positively strained leading points of the turbulent flame 
brush for non-zero Markstein length fuels [265]. 

The second topic was devoted to extracting ST correlations for ease of 
use in combustion modeling. Regarding syngas-air mixtures at higher 
pressure than atmospheric, some of them are presented in Table 8. 

However, such correlations are obviously incapable of capturing all 
sensitivities of the TFS. For example, Venkateswaran et al. [267] used ST 
databases for negative Markstein length fuel blends, i.e., mixtures with 
small Lewis number like H2-rich syngas- or H2-air mixtures, and high-
lighted  that  it  is  challenging  to  distinguish  the  effects  of  time-scale, 
length-scale,  and  ReT  on  these  correlations.  Thus,  future  works  are 
needed with novel correlations in a more unified form. 

As the final point of this section, the detailed experimental study on 
chemistry-turbulence interaction and instabilities of the flame front for 
simpler fuels like H2 particularly, in turbulent flame combustion is next 
to impossible at this instant, while it is possible with the aid of the direct 
numerical simulation (DNS) [268]. An exciting subject addressed with 
DNS is the effect of preferential diffusivity on turbulent spherical syngas 
flames on the lean side of stoichiometric. This is due to the well-known 
behavior  of  lean  hydrogen-air  mixtures,  which  is  a  non-unity  Lewis 
number fuel and differs from heavy hydrocarbon fuels. In an example 
study of three-dimensional DNS with detailed chemistry for lean 70:30 
H2/CO syngas at p = 4 bar, it was found [269] that thermo-diffusive 
instabilities  have  negligible  impact  on  cellularity  development  of 
flame structures under high turbulence levels, though the flame accel-
eration and species diffusive flux are still influenced by the preferential 
diffusion. The same authors [270] showed how the interaction between 
equivalence ratio variation and instabilities could affect the heat release 
rate. Performing two-dimensional DNS for a turbulent expanding 50/50 
H2/CO syngas flame at ϕ = 0.6 and atmospheric conditions, Bhide and 
Sreedhara [271] found heat release rate enhancement and a rise in flame 
speed  for  even  a  quiescent  medium  due  to  high  mass  diffusivity  of 
hydrogen.  Under  greater turbulence  levels, a  further increase  in  HRR 
and a shift in the peak location of HRR towards low-temperature zones 
were  also  seen.  The  shifting  trend  was  ascribed  to  atomic  hydrogen 
species, and it disappeared at high pressure and temperature conditions. 
The  differential  diffusion  effect  (related  to  the  different  values  of  the 
species Le) was also observed to diminish when raising the CO fraction 
to 70%. 

In conclusion, while noting that high-pressure turbulent combustion

cannot be directly inferred from atmospheric turbulent combustion re-
sults [209], there is no consensus among published findings at higher 
pressures than atmospheric, nor even a general description for turbulent 
premixed syngas flames. There are also very few studies presenting the 
turbulent combustion of spherical (model) syngas flames compared to 
Bunsen-type  flames.  As  in  Daniele  et  al.  [257]  study  under  gas 
turbine-relevant conditions, there is a need to study turbulent spherical 
syngas flames with boundary conditions matched with those in an IC 
engine, also considering the dilution effect. 

3. Syngas application in IC engines 

3.1. Syngas in SI engines 

Research  on  syngas application  in  SI  engines has  been  focused on 
improving  the  fuel  consumption  (or  fuel  conversion  efficiency)  and 
engine-out  emissions.  All  employed  strategies  that  result  in  a  more 
efficient SI engine4  can be divided into two categories, along with the 
associated engine design modifications:  

1-  Improve stoichiometric operation with a combination of downsizing, 

boosting, and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) strategies.  

2-  Move towards lean or ultra-lean operation through the intake charge 

dilution and advanced direct injection strategies. 

The  lean  combustion  concept  in  gasoline  SI  engines  has  allowed 
higher  brake  thermal  efficiency  due  to  reducing  pumping  and  heat 
transfer losses, while keeping NOx emissions low because of lower peak 
combustion  temperatures.  However,  ultra-lean  combustion  requires 
careful  consideration  in  order  to  operate  the  engine  beyond  the  lean 
limit  or  dilution  limit.  While  a  number  of  methods,  including  intake 
design improvement, advanced ignition systems, and EGR stratification, 
could address this, reformate containing hydrogen-rich gas can serve as 
an extender of lean and flammability limits of the engine. Additionally, 
since the choice of fuel directly affects the engine’s lean limit, alterna-
tive fuels with reformate can also be used in SI engines. Also, synergies 
can  emerge  from  syngas  production  via  on-board  fuel  reforming  and 
thermochemical energy recovery techniques. However, the focus of this 
section is to run SI engines with syngas as the primary fuel, which can 
only improve engine’s efficiency by extending its lean limit. 

3.1.1. 100% Syngas in carbureted and port fuel injection (PFI) SI engines 
The majority of studies on 100% syngas-fueled SI engine have used 
carburetor or port fuel injection (PFI) technologies in power generation 
for two main reasons. First, the SI engine can integrate thermo- and bio- 
chemical processes in which feedstock can be supplied from viable, eco- 
friendly energy resources, e.g., biomass. Second, since the LHV of syngas 
is lower than that of typical fuels such as gasoline and natural gas, the 
engine  output  power  and  torque  could  drop  by  20-40%  with  syngas 
operation,  as  reported  in  several  published  works  [59,272,273].  This 
drawback makes using 100% syngas in SI engines via carburetor or PFI 
technologies unsuitable for vehicular applications. However, it is a good 
choice for stationary applications where some limited operating points 
can  be  optimized  by  MBT  timing.  Also,  the  engine-out  emissions  can 
vary by changing the ways of syngas production or adding some other 
species to syngas. A brief review of 100% syngas fueled SI engines for 
stationary and transportation applications is presented below. 

Syngas composition variability can affect the level of extending the 
lean limit of engine combustion. Ando et al. [274] evaluated the per-
formance of low-BTU gases produced from gasification and a two-step 

pyrolysis/reforming  process  in  a  small-scale  naturally  aspirated  (NA) 
single-cylinder SI engine with variable compression ratio from 8.47 and 
11.9 and an installed mixer instead of the original carburetor. The gas 
produced  from  gasification  was  hydrogen-rich,  while  that  from  the 
two-step pyrolysis was methane-rich. They found that both gases pro-
vided  similar  thermal  efficiency  compared  to  CNG.  In  addition,  the 
hydrogen-rich gas was observed to show a wider stable engine operation 
range with the λ up to 2.0, and NOx and HC emissions were quite low for 
it compared to both CNG and the methane-rich gas. Bika [275] inves-
limits  of  a 
tigated  the  combustion  characteristics  and  knock 
syngas-fueled  SI  engine  with  a  variable  compression 
ratio 
(CR=6:1-10:1). The fuels investigated were pure H2, H2/CO: 75/25, and 
H2/CO: 50/50 (% by vol.). He reported that increase in the CO fraction 
increased the knock limit of syngas and advanced the ignition timing of 
MBT but did not affect the indicated efficiency up to H2/CO: 50/50. In 
addition,  the  maximum  heat  HRR  was  observed  with  pure  hydrogen. 
However,  the  compression  ratio  increase  affected  the  peak  pressure 
more than by the CO percentage increase. A maximum ITE of 32% was 
reported  with  H2/CO:  50/50  at  ϕ=0.6  and  CR=10:1.  The  general 
conclusion was that the extended combustion duration with a higher CO 
percentage  provides  more  knock  resistance  at  a  higher  compression 
ratio. 

As mentioned earlier, the power output of SI engines is usually de- 
rated during operation with 100% syngas. For instance, Mustafi et al. 
[272] studied a syngas fuel named “Powergas” that contained 44%H2, 
52% CO, and 4% N2 produced from the Aqua-fuel process5, to evaluate 
the performance and emissions with Powergas (15.3 MJ/kg LHV) in a 
variable CR Ricardo E6 single-cylinder SI engine and also compared it 
with those with gasoline at lean (ϕ = 0.81) and CNG at stoichiometric 
conditions (ϕ = 1.0). The Powergas indicated no superior performance 
relative  to  CNG  and  gasoline  as  the  main  fuel  in  the  SI  engine.  They 
observed more than 20% decline in brake torque output and more than 
100% increase in BSFC compared to gasoline and CNG at 1500 rpm and 
CR = 8.1:1, as seen in Fig. 18. Although the engine-out THC and CO 
emissions with syngas fueling were lower than those with gasoline and 
CNG, both CO2  and NOx emissions were higher. Similar power losses 
have also been reported with syngas combustion in SI engines [272,274, 
276-280], especially at lower CR and closer to stoichiometric conditions 
and operating away from the MBT timing. Munoz et al. [276] also found 
around 50% reduction in power output of a carbureted SI engine with 
producer gas compared to gasoline, at CR=8.1:1. 

Shah  et  al.  [277]  experimentally  studied  the  performance  of  a 
single-cylinder SI engine with syngas produced from biomass gasifica-
tion.  The  syngas  was  composed  of  16.2–24.2%  CO,  13–19.4%  H2, 
1.2–6.4% CH4, 9.3–13.8% CO2, and the balance N2 with an LHV of about 
5.79  MJ/Nm3.  Based  on  the  results  obtained,  the  overall  engine  effi-
ciency from the combustion of both syngas and gasoline fuels was found 
to  be  similar  at  the  same  maximum  power  output,  albeit  higher 
maximum power output was achieved by gasoline operation. CO was 
observed to be 30–96% lower with syngas than gasoline at each oper-
ating point due to the higher carbon content of gasoline fuel. In addition, 
the  HC  emission  of  syngas  was  negligible  at  less  than  40  ppm  in  all 
operating conditions due to the presence of very less HC (1.2–6.4%) in 
the syngas used in this study. However, the main reason for HC reduc-
tion  could  be  the  increased  H2  content  in  the  fuel  mixture,  which  is 
responsible for promoting fast conversion of HCs [273]. It was also re-
ported  that  NOx  emissions  in  syngas  operation  were  lower,  about 
54–94%,  compared  to  gasoline  operation.  This  was  due  to  the  lower 
cylinder  temperatures  as  a  result  of  the  lower  LHV  of  syngas.  The 
operating fuel/air equivalence ratio (ϕ) in this study was not directly

syngas. It is complicated to run a 100% syngas-fueled SI engine close to 
stoichiometric  conditions  (i.e.,  ϕ  > 0.75)  because  the  retardation  of 
ignition timing after the TDC is required due to hydrogen presence in the 
syngas composition (irrespective of unstable combustion possibility due 
to high hydrogen content in syngas). With this in mind, the following 
two studies are presented for fixed and varying ignition timings. 

In a study intended for vehicular applications, Arroyo et al. [281] 
conducted an experimental study to compare the operation of a NA SI 
engine fueled with two different syngas cases and two typical gasoline 
and methane fuels, at ϕ = 1, 0.85, and 0.7 in full and medium-loads over 
a wide range of engine speeds. Two syngas fuels produced from catalytic 
decomposition of biogas with molar composition of 23% H2  and 23% 
CO, 26% CH4, and 28% CO2, with the LHV=14.095 MJ/kg as syngas #1, 
and 40% H2, 39% CO, 11% CH4, 10% CO2, with LHV=16.525 MJ/kg as 
syngas  #2,  were  tested.  A  considerable  loss  in  BTE  was  observed  in 
gaseous  fueling  cases  at  stoichiometric  conditions;  however,  a  slight 
increase in power occurred at ϕ=0.85, as shown in Fig. 19 (gasoline did 
not achieve stable combustion at ϕ=0.7). As the authors reported, the 
reason for higher NOx emissions was the increased H2 and the decreased 
diluent  contents,  e.g.,  CO2,  in  syngas  composition.  The  established 
comparison with syngas #1, syngas #2, and methane showed that the 

high  methane  fraction  of  the  syngas  fuel  accounts  for  the  increased 
levels of HC emissions. The general increasing CO2 trend of syngas cases 
with  respect  to  gasoline  and  methane  cases  seen  was  due  to  the  CO2 
◦
content in syngas. Nevertheless, a fixed injection timing (15
BTDC) of 
gasoline  used  as  a  baseline  for  all cases  in  this  study  may  result  in  a 
deviation from a realistic comparison. 

In  the  case  of  varying  ignition  timing  to  achieve  MBT,  Ran  et  al. 
[282]  conducted  experiments  to  differentiate  the  performance  and 
emissions of a NA PFI single-cylinder CFR engine operating on E10 (90% 
gasoline  + 10%  ethanol  vol.),  CNG  (95%  CH4  vol.),  ethanol  (95% 
ethanol + 5% water vol.), and syngas (60% H2  + 40% CO vol.) at an 
engine  speed  of  1200  rpm  and  CR  = 8:1.  The  ϕ  was  in  the  range  of 
0.74-0.99,  0.63-0.98,  0.76-0.97,  and  0.3-0.78  for  fuels  in  the  above-
mentioned order. The high heat release rates and spark timing restricted 
the  upper  side  of  ϕ  for  syngas  (see  Fig.  20  (b)).  Among  tested  fuels, 
syngas  indicated  the  lowest  net  IMEP  due  to  having  the  lowest  volu-
metric efficiency and LHV. Generally, the volumetric efficiency of syn-
gas and CNG due to their gaseous nature and lack of evaporative cooling 
effects  is  lower  than  for  liquid  fuels. Also,  the  stoichiometric  air/fuel 
ratio of syngas is lower than CNG; therefore, extra mass fuel is injected 
for  syngas  fueling,  resulting  in  more  degradation  of  volumetric

efficiency, as can be seen in Fig. 20 (a). Moreover, the lowest CA0-10% 
(flame development period) and CA10-90% (rapid burn period) belonged 
to syngas because of the high laminar flame speed and high diffusivity of 
the H2  content in syngas. However, the smaller quenching distance of 
H2,  which  implies  the  flame  could  travel  nearer  to  the  cylinder  wall, 
leading to higher heat loss, reducing the net indicated efficiency (Fig. 20 
(c)) at closer stoichiometric conditions. 

Another work [283] tried to draw a comparison between syngas, and 
biogas, biogas-syngas blend fueling cases in a NA SI engine at various 
MBT timings and at a fixed engine speed of 1500 rpm, using experiments 
and numerical simulations. The syngas used had a molar composition of 
17% H2, 15% CO, 4% CH4, 15% CO2, and the balance N2 (HHV= 5.65 
MJ/nm3) and biogas had 65% CH4, 35% CO2 (HHV=25.83 MJ/kg). The 
corresponding ITE, NOx emissions, higher temperature, and maximum 
pressure  derivative  for  both  syngas  and  biogas  fueling  are  shown  in 
Fig. 21. As seen, all observed variables have a relatively distinct sensi-
tivity to where ignition timing occurs, revealing that the previous work 
lacks a reasonable basis for comparison. Although the syngas fueled SI 
engine  due  to having  high H2, low  CO2,  and  presence of  N2  contents 
produces more NOx and has the highest temperature regions over the 
entire ignition timing sweep than the biogas one, lower NOx formation 
belongs to syngas, 3 g/kWh, rather than biogas, 7 g/kWh, at maximum 
◦
MBT operation, where the maximum ITE happens (26
BTDC for 
syngas and biogas, respectively). Additionally, syngas fueling not only 
indicates 1.5% more ITE compared to biogas at maximum MBT, but also 
tends to maintain high ITE over the whole range of ignition timing in 
contrast to biogas, indicating the superior combustion characteristics of 
H2 relative to CH4.

3.1.2. 100% syngas in CI engines retrofitted to SI mode 

To  mitigate  the  power  loss  with  syngas  use  in  SI  engines,  Sridhar 
et  al.  [284,285]  experimentally  studied  syngas  combustion  in  a 
multi-cylinder SI engine modified from a diesel engine at varying CRs 
(11:5:1 to 17:1). Fig. 22 shows in-cylinder pressure traces at different 
CRs, which did not show any trace of knock for all the studied loads. 
Performance of the engine at higher CRs was smooth and proved that 
syngas use in the SI mode at higher CR is technically feasible. Homdoung 
et al. [286,287] also reported that for CRs as high as 17:1, the engine 
fueled  with  producer  gas  (PG,  see  section  1)  could  operate  smoothly 
without knock risk. This was attributed to the faster burn rate due to the 
presence of H2 in the PG. Although the maximum BTE for the PG engine 
was lower than the original diesel engine by about 3.5%, and the smoke

density recorded in the diesel engine (1.5-12%) was much higher than 
that in the PG case (0-2%). Zero-dimensional (0-D) modeling was also 
employed  to  compare  the  brake  power  results  obtained  under  a 
wide-open throttle (WOT) condition, and a good agreement was noticed

with experimental results [288]. 

Raman and Ram [289] studied the efficiency of a syngas-fueled en-
gine  at  different  loads.  Fig.  23  illustrates  the  comparison  of  syngas, 
diesel,  and  natural  gas  engines  in  power  generation  efficiency  at 
different load conditions. The maximum power generation efficiency of 
the  diesel,  natural  gas,  and  syngas  engine  is  28%,  24%,  and  21%, 
respectively. Again, a reduction in torque and power de-rating for the 
syngas engine was observed, but at a lower amount. The syngas engine 
operates at 21% power generation efficiency at the full load condition, 
which is about 20% and 10% less than that of the diesel and natural gas 
engines. 

It  can  be  mentioned  that  increasing  the  engine  compression  ratio 
through use of CI engines retrofitted to the SI mode is an efficient way to 
increase brake power. However, an average of 16% power loss can be 
observed in the gas mode compared to diesel operation at a comparable 
CR.  Recently,  Park  et  al.  [290]  demonstrated  that  high  compression 
ratios and intake boosting could improve syngas (30% H2, 25% CO, 45% 
CO2)  fueled  SI  engine  power  and  efficiency.  Engine  operation  with  a 
high compression ratio of 17.1:1 was possible in the lean combustion 
mode owing to the low combustion temperature. The gross ITE in the 
lean combustion mode was 18.4% higher than that in the stoichiometric 
combustion mode, mainly because of a significant reduction in the heat 
transfer loss. However, the gross indicated power in the lean combustion 
mode  was  25.6%  lower  than  that  in  the  stoichiometric  combustion 
mode. In summary, stoichiometric operation using syngas was appro-
priate for a high-power engine generator, whereas lean operation using 
syngas is more suitable for a high-efficiency engine generator. 

3.1.3. 100% Syngas in direct injection (DI) SI engines 

Hagos et al. [291–293] were the first researchers to utilize syngas 
(50%H2/50%CO) as the primary fuel in a direct-injection spark-ignition 
(DISI)  engine,  and  then  compared  its  combustion,  performance,  and 
emissions characteristics to those with CNG operation (as the baseline). 
It  should  be  noted  that  besides  overcoming  the  issues  related  to  the 
volumetric efficiency of gaseous fuels, the backfire phenomenon is also 
being  addressed  by  the  DI  ignition  system.  As  well-known,  imple-
mentation of gaseous injectors in comparison with liquid ones has its 
own  difficulty  in  terms  of  injector geometry  and  engine-related  char-
acteristics such as the interaction between piston design6 and the mixing 
process with late injection, injector width pulse, etc. An improvement to 
the previous work [272], as the authors stated, was a slight decrease in 
brake torque from ranging 20-30% to 14-19% at the same speed of 1500 
rpm, due to eliminating issues attributed to volumetric efficiency pen-
alty of delivering gaseous fuels at the intake. Despite the improvement, 
Hagos et al. [294] came across a limitation on the injection duration at 
late injection timings and higher  BSFC with syngas fueling than CNG 
fueling. Thus, the engine operation was limited to near stoichiometric 
conditions,  leading  to  a  restriction  in  maximum  brake  power  and  a 
request for a bigger fuel tank. These all were attributed to the low LHV of 
syngas,  which  is  lower  than  a  fifth  of  LHV  of  CNG  (see  Table  5).  To 
overcome this, in a series of works Hagos et al. [294–296] investigated 
enriching the syngas with methane (a higher LHV fuel) in a DISI engine. 
The new fuel was named methane enriched syngas (MES), consisting of 
H2/CO/CH4: 40/40/20 (% by vol.). It was found that the MES shortens 
the injection duration of syngas and extends the air/fuel stoichiometric 
ratio  (λ)  compared  to  CNG  and  syngas  at  the  same  engine  speed. 
Furthermore,  the  MES  improved  the  maximum  BTE  and  the  BSFC  by 
30.2% and 21.3%, with a little effect on the CO, NOx, and THC emissions 
[294] (see Fig. 24). 

6  Even  by  eliminating  the  physical  processes  associated  with  the  spray  of 
liquid  fuel  (droplet  breakup  to  evaporation),  a  sufficient  time  for  the  charge 
mixing process at late injection is still needed because the shape of the piston 
head  affects  the  charge  distribution,  which  may  result  in  an  uneven  air/fuel 
ratio in the chamber.

Following the work of Hagos [292], Fiore et al. [297] numerically 
investigated the effect of piston shapes and injection specifications on 
the  performance  and  emissions  of  a  syngas-fueled  DI  SI  engine.  The 
parametric  study  included  three  different  piston  bowl  profiles  and

shaped profile can provide best performance, despite of maximum NOx 
emissions compared to the high clearance and low clearance combustion 
cups.  The  results  were  very  sensitive  to  the  injection  angle  and  SOI, 
which affected the fuel distribution. 
Particulate matter (PM) emission: 
Compared to PFI engines, particulate matter (PM) emissions lead to a 
known big challenge in DISI engines, especially for ultrafine particles, 
which harmfully affect human health [298]. The sources of PM forma-
tion in DISI stem from mixture inhomogeneity because of a lack of time 
for fuel atomization and spray impingement, which depends on many 
factors,  including  operating  engine  conditions,  air-fuel  equivalence 
ratio, injection timing, spark timing, and fuel-specific properties [299]. 
While  fueling  a  DISI  engine  with  hydrocarbon-free  gaseous  fuels  is 
seemingly  expected  to  lead  to  lower  particle  emission,  Thawko  et  al. 
[300] surprisingly showed a 170% increase in total particle concentra-
tion of reformate (H2/CO2:75/25 %by mole) fueling compared to gas-
oline  at  the  same  and  fixed  engine  speed  and  load.  The  most  likely 
reason  for  the  high  measured  particle  is  attributed  to  the  interaction 
between lubricating oil and high-pressure reformate jet, as the authors 
claimed. Due to its lower density, the required time for syngas fuel in-
jection  at  high  pressure  is  much  longer  than  that  for  the  liquid  fuel. 
Besides,  the  small  flame  quenching  distance  of  hydrogen  content  in 
syngas may result in the syngas flame traveling closer to the lubricated 
cylinder walls. Thus, the chance of lubricant participating in the com-
bustion rises. In terms of particle size distribution, it was indicated that 
the  nucleation  mode  (< 50  nm)  is  primarily  responsible  for  the 
discrepancy in total particle number concentration between reformate 
and gasoline fueled DISI engines, as can be seen in Fig. 25 (right). 

In  contrast,  Bogarra  et  al.  [301]  indicated  that  the  addition  of 
reformate  (H2/CO/CO2/H2O:  5/2.7/11/9.0  %vol.)  plus  EGR  (called 
R-EGR, see Section 4.1) as supplementary fuel to gasoline in a gasoline 
direct  injection  (GDI)  engine  reduced  the  engine  PM  emissions  even 
more than the addition of EGR only, as shown in Fig. 26. It was found 
that the reformate combustion can significantly decrease the PM emis-
sions, however, the reduction was dependent on the PM nature. Refor-
mate combustion was also found to remove soot cores more efficiently 
than the volatile PM. Moreover, fuel reforming technology did not show 
significant detrimental influence on the TWC operation for the studied 
conditions. 

3.1.4. Syngas addition in SI engines 

As mentioned earlier, a possible use of syngas in SI engines is as an 
additive to enrich or improve the performance of another fuel such as 
methane  or  a  methane-rich  biofuel  (natural  gas  or  landfill  gas);  and 
gasoline. Since syngas has a lower heating value than these two fuels, the 
improvement obtained by adding it is not really on the engine power but 
rather  on  the  efficiency,  combustion,  and  pollutant  emissions.  Con-
cerning  knock  studies,  Gerty  and  Heywood  [302]  experimentally 
investigated  the  performance  of  a  knock-limited  SI  engine  by  consid-
ering  the  effects  of  relative  air/fuel  ratio,  inlet  boost  pressure, 
compression ratio, and reformate added to the tested fuel-air mixtures. 
The tested fuels were: Unleaded test gasoline (UTG96, representing as 
gasoline or indolene fuel with octane number of 96), primary reference 
fuel (PRF, a mixture of iso-octane and n-heptane), and toluene reference 
fuel (TRF, a mixture of toluene and n-heptane). A bottled mixture, as 
reformate, of H2/CO/N2: 25/26/49 (% by vol.) was utilized to simulate 
the output of a POX fuel reformer (named Plasmatron, see subsection 
4.1.1). The mixture was considered the replacement for a portion of the 
main fuel (gasoline), which then mixes with the gasoline in the intake 
manifold. Fig. 27 (a) shows the combustion retard, which was defined as

alkane hydrocarbons. The combustion retard needed to avoid knocking

decreased by about 2
TRF fuels composed of more than 20% n-heptane with octane numbers 
of  95  or  lower,  reformate  addition  was  only  marginally  less  effective 
than for PRF fuels. As the content of alkanes declined and the aromatic 
content increased, reformate addition seemed to be less successful for 
TRFs to the point where there was no value in reformate addition to pure 
toluene. 

Using the same reformate and at low CR (9.8:1), a direct comparison 
between  pure hydrogen  and reformate additions  showed that both of 
them could extend both peak efficiency and the lean limit of indolene 
combustion linearly [303,304]. On the contrary, at high CR (13.4:1), the 
reformate addition was no longer had a linear relationship, while pure 
hydrogen  still  indicated  an  obvious,  proportional/linear  extension  of 
peak efficiency [305], as can be seen in Fig. 28 (left). The main reason 
for this behavior was due to the proportional extension of the location of 
the Δθ10  (cid:0) 90%=30
CA. However, no distinguishable curves were seen 
with increase of reformate, as shown in Fig. 28 (right).

the combustion phasing disparity at the current state and the optimal

reduction in combustion retard can be seen with increasing reformate 
fraction. The reduction with the addition of reformate for each fuel was 
normalized, as shown in Fig. 27(b). As can be seen, reformate addition

Caterpillar engine converted to SI operation. A 44% extension of EGR 
tolerance on a mass basis and a 77% reduction in raw NOx emissions for 
using syngas with natural gas were detected compared to the natural gas 
case. Cha et al. [307] experimentally investigated the operating char-
acteristic of an SI engine for power generation upon mixing CH4  and 
simulated syngas (H2 and CO) in a diesel engine that was modified to run 
in the SI mode with a CR=13:1. Fig. 29 shows the fuel conversion effi-
ciency  versus  NOx  emissions  for  various  fuel  mixtures,  where  NOx 
emissions were elevated as fuel conversion efficiency increased. How-
ever, this increase was insignificant for syngas compared to H2  or CO 
when  added to CH4-air mixtures at a ratio  of 5% of the overall LHV. 
Since on-board fuel reforming methods can produce syngas as the pri-
mary fuel, this will be discussed in section 4. 

A summary of the main research works  published on syngas utili-
zation in SI engine is presented in Table 9. Future study of 100% syngas- 
fueled SI engines can be followed in designing an appropriate injection 
system  for  gaseous  fuel  like  syngas  in  DISI  engines  and  applying 
advanced spark systems like multiple injections. 

3.2. Syngas in HCCI engines 

Research  on  syngas  utilization  in  advanced  combustion  strategies 
has  significantly  increased  due  to  its  clean-burning  properties  and 
possible  production  from  several  paths.  The  homogeneous  charge 
compression  ignition  (HCCI)  engine  is  a  low-temperature  combustion 
(LTC) concept which combines the best features of SI and CI engines. 
The HCCI engine has shown the potential for higher efficiency and ultra- 
low NOx and soot emissions, however it has some drawbacks in terms of 
limited  operating  range,  combustion  control  and  excessive  unburned 
products  [319,320].  In  this  part,  syngas-fueled  HCCI  combustion  is 
analyzed in detail. 

3.2.1. 100% syngas fueling 

According  to  the  finding  of  previously  published  papers,  HCCI 
combustion with syngas has not shown superior performance over other 
fuels. It faces a similar barrier, such as the limited operating window and 
a need for regulating the intake temperature to control the combustion 
event. For instance, Stenlåås et al. [321] focused on HCCI combustion of 
100% syngas, which was reformed methanol gas (RMG), a mixture of 
hydrogen  and  carbon  monoxide  in  the  volume  ratio  2:1,  and  then 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience90(2022)10099524A. Paykani et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                

combustion, Maurya et al. [327] used a stochastic reactor model (SRM) 
with  a  detailed  chemical  kinetic  mechanism  (32  species  and  173  re-
actions)  to  numerically  investigate  syngas  fueled  HCCI  combustion 
validated  against  previous  experiments  [323].  Within  the  SRM,  a 
probability density function  (PDF) was  used to define the  local (vari-
able)  and  global  (constant)  physical  parameters.  For  various  engine 
operating conditions, simulations were performed by changing intake 
temperature, engine load, and speed at a constant compression ratio of 
19:1, and the obtained operating window is shown in Fig. 30. The in-
clined hatched line represents operating conditions with a combustion 
efficiency of less than 80%. The area with PPRR > 5 MPa/ms is repre-
sented by the crossed hatched region, and the contour lines in the plot 
represent IMEP. Operating conditions with combustion efficiency higher 
than 80% and PPRR < 5 MPa/ms are considered as the operating area of 
the HCCI engine. It can be seen that increasing the intake temperature 
(or Tivc, specified at intake valve closing) can help the operating range in 
the lean-side of stoichiometry, but at the expense of lowered IMEP due to 
decreased volumetric efficiency. At higher engine speed, suitable oper-
ating range has adversely shifted to a more bounded region that is highly 
sensitive to intake temperature and excess air (λ or air-fuel ratio). In this 
case, the chance of incomplete or vigorous combustion is severe. The 
maximum combustion efficiency of 98% is reported in the study. 

While the abovementioned works have dealt with 100% syngas in 
the form of simulated reformate gas (with only H2 and CO), there are a 
number of published works with producer gas generated from a biomass 
gasification process. Przybyla et al. [328] compared SI and HCCI fueled 
with low calorific producer gas under the same load; they reported that 
the  syngas-fueled  HCCI  engine  had  extremely  high  CO  and  a  lower 
indicated efficiency than SI, equaling a more than 10% loss in the base 
fuel’s chemical energy. It is worth mentioned that the use of high intake 
temperature to control the combustion in syngas-fueled HCCI engines 
has been reported in previous works. Bhaduri et al. [329] employed high 
temperature  strategy  as  a  positive  advantage  over  a  syngas-fueled  SI 
engine to introduce a novel concept of unprocessed syngas-fueled HCCI, 
which has tar contents and moisture. Because the intake temperature 
◦
was set to around T=250
C, which is higher than the dew point of the 
tars, issues related to tar condensation were eradicated. According to the 
authors, moisture in syngas tends to delay combustion, while tars’ effect 
was negligible. Nevertheless, such an intake temperature is not accept-
able for vehicular applications, but the readers can refer to their later 
works [330–332] for in-depth information on this concept. We believe 
that a brief discussion of syngas impurities can also be useful here. 

3.2.2. Syngas addition 

Reformate as ignition controller: 
The  operating  range  of  kinetically-controlled  HCCI  combustion  is 
narrow due to lack of any direct control on ignition timing; this can lead 
to extremely high pressure rise rates corresponding to nearly constant 
volume heat release of a homogeneous air-fuel mixture in the combus-
tion chamber at high loads (for low octane fuels), and poor combustion 
and  misfiring  at  low  loads  (for  high  octane  fuels).  To  mitigate  this, 
various techniques such as intake charge preheating [333], EGR [334, 
335], boosting [336,337], using two fuels with different reactivity (i.e., 
one has a high octane and the other has a high cetane number) [338, 
339] have been proposed which proved to have a profound effect on 
control of ignition event. For more details about these techniques, one 
can refer to [340,341]. 

Syngas or reformate plays the role of the ignition-timing controller 
by either retardation (if it is the primary fuel with high octane number, 
e.g.,  syngas/diesel  fueling  case)  or  advancement  (if  used  as  the  sec-
ondary fuel with higher combustibility characteristics, e.g., natural gas/ 
syngas)  of  the  main  combustion,  which  leads  to  widening  the  load 
operating range of the HCCI engine. In the former case, syngas has two 
widespread effects on fuels, showing two stages of heat release such as 
diesel, n-heptane, and dimethyl ether (DME). These result in prolonged 
ignition delay times, and widened combustion duration (in other words, 

Fig.  29. NOx  emissions  versus  fuel  conversion  efficiency  for  various  compo-
nents  added  to  CH4-air  mixtures  at  different  spark  timings  (Reprinted  and 
modified from [307] with permission of Elsevier). 

compared it to pure hydrogen fueling [322] in SI operating mode. They 
found that a higher temperature for RMG fueling than pure hydrogen 
was required to achieve the same combustion duration with HCCI mode. 
Both hydrogen- and RMG-fueled HCCI did not provide sufficient exhaust 
energy for the on-board reforming process by waste heat recovery. In 
summary,  the  operating  mode  based  on  100%  reformate  was  more 
favorable for SI mode operation. 

Several years later, Bika et al. [323] measured the HCCI performance 
on 100% syngas fueling at two equivalence ratios, 0.26 and 0.30, and an 
engine speed of 1800 rpm, with a diesel engine converted to HCCI mode 
by adding PFI injection and intake air heating systems. Three compo-
sitions  were  considered:  H2=100%,  H2/CO=3/1,  and  H2/CO=1/1  by 
volume.  By  increasing  intake  temperature,  it  was  seen  that  the 
in-cylinder pressure, temperature, and heat release started to increase, 
and finally led to advancing the combustion phasing, which had com-
bustion efficiency in the range of ηc  = 83%-88%. Also, by altering the 
equivalence ratio towards leaner regions and increasing CO in syngas, 
the  intake  temperature  was  increased  to  maintain  the  best  IMEP 
conditions. 

With  the  aim  of  improving  HCCI  combustion  and  reduction  of 
pollution  emissions  based  on  the  syngas-air  mixture,  a  few  modeling 
studies [324,325] have been carried out to explore the effect of various 
species addition. Starik et al. [325] assessed the potential of the addition 
of a highly reactive species such as ozone or singlet delta oxygen (SDO) 
into  an  HCCI  fueled  with  syngas  (50%H2/50%CO  by  volume).  They 
noticed that the presence of 0.38% of O3 mole fraction (=1% of SDO) in 
total oxygen could diminish the dependency on high intake temperature 
by  accelerating  and  intensifying  the  ignition  and  combustion  event, 
especially under the low load regime (φ = 0.2); this resulted in a 7-14% 
improvement of engine power output and up to a 15% reduction of both 
CO and NO emissions due to lack of excessO2. 

For better understanding of auto-ignition and combustion develop-
ment  in  HCCI  based  on  100%  syngas,  Yamasaki  and  Kaneko  [326] 
conducted an experimental and modeling study using mock syngas with 
varying compositions, ranging from 20% to 40% for H2, 7-27% for CO, 
20-40%  for  N2,  10-30%  for  CO2,  and  a  3%  CH4  by  volume.  An 
auto-ignition temperature of T=1100 K, almost similar to hydrocarbon 
fuels, was observed for syngas, governed by in-cylinder gas temperature 
and not by the fuel composition tested. It was also found that H2 has a 
longer  conversion  time  than  CO  during  the  combustion  process,  and 
combustion duration can be roughly determined by the volumetric ratio 
of  H2/  CO2.  For  detailed  analysis  of  the  syngas  combustion  in  HCCI

syngas with low NOx, low CO, and no THC. 

Smooth combustion at CR=17:1. To achieve MBT, 
a retardation in spark timings is needed. Compared 
to diesel mode, at equal CR, the maximum power

smoother combustion). This can be justified according to the following:  

1-  Dilution  (or  concentration)  effect:  O2-deficiency  happening  by 
replacing  O2  with H2  leads  to weakening the low-temperature HR 
(LTHR or partial oxidation) stage of the fuel, which is a preparation 
step of combusting the in-cylinder mixture, resulting in lowering the 
hydroxyl  (OH)  concentration,  and  thus  retarding  the  high- 
temperature  HR  (HTHR  or  combustion).  It  was  shown  that  the 
magnitude  of  LTHR  has  a  direct  correlation  with  advancing  or 
retarding the HTHR [342].  

2-  Chemical  effect:  OH  generated  from  the  first  HR  stage  may  be 
consumed  by  hydrogen  (i.e.,  H2  + OH  = H2O  + H),  suppressing 
chemical kinetics of the mixture before the combustion. 

In the latter case, the strong thermal effect of syngas on high octane 
fuels like natural gas may result in rising the specific heat capacity of the 
mixture  and  increasing  the  compression  temperature  of  in-cylinder 
charge eventually, depending on intake temperature. To highlight the 
thermal effect, valving strategies may be helpful without needing intake 
preheating.  Eng  et  al.  [343]  reopened  the  exhaust  valve  during  the

intake  stroke  to  obtain  more  hot  gases  in  the  cylinder,  i.e.,  exhaust 
re-breathing. The combustion chamber of an HCCI-mode engine fueled 
with iso-octane and partial oxidation gas (POX gas) added to the intake 
experiences  a  high quantity  of  internal residuals  and  thermal  stratifi-
cation; this causes the ignition timing to advance. Another technique is 
negative valve overlap (NVO), in which the residuals are trapped and 
recompressed, as described in section 4. 

Dimethyl ether (DME) has some more interesting combustion char-
acteristics than diesel (i.e., soot-free combustion and lower NOx emis-
sions), but still faces challenges with regard to its physical properties (i. 
e.,  low  viscosity,  which  leads  to  higher  leakage  and  in  turn  engine 
durability  concerns)  [344].  Similar  to  syngas,  DME  can  benefit  from 
on-board  fuel  reforming  in  vehicles  via  a  methanol-steam  reforming 
process [345]. With these mentioned potentials for DME, and emerging 
dual-fueling  strategies  for  achieving  controllable  HCCI  combustion, 
Shudo et al. [346–351] conducted a number of experiments supported 
by  chemical  kinetics  analysis,  to  run  a  single-cylinder  SI  engine  con-
verted to the HCCI mode fueled with DME and MRG (methanol reformed 
gas or syngas). Both fuels were produced from endothermic methanol 
steam  reforming  using  engine  exhaust  gases,  and  then  followed  by 
methane  dehydration  for  DME  generation;  with  a  single  fuel  tank 
required  for  liquid  methanol,  as  seen  in  Fig.  31  (left).  While  using 
simulated reformate comprising 67% H2 and 33% CO (by volume) in the 
experiments, they found that ignition of the second heat release (main 
combustion) and engine load could be controlled by altering the pro-
portion  of  the  MRG/DME  ratio;  by  increasing  the  ratio,  the  overall 
system efficiency reached 49% and a 14% rise in engine efficiency over 
the baseline was obtained (see Fig. 31 (right)). This controllable HCCI 
concept was achieved due to delayed ignition and increased temperature 
before the main combustion, corresponding to the hydrogen content of 
the MRG. Similarly, they proposed this concept by storing a tank of DME 
and partial oxidation of it to produce DME reformed gas (DRG) [352]. 

They  stated  that  this  concept  with  HCCI  combustion  can  result  in 
high  thermal  efficiency  over  a  wide  operable  window  of  equivalence 
ratio and high overall system efficiency, which is comparable to the fuel 
cell system. A brief summary of their work is given as follows:  

1-  Using an optimal compression ratio along with a suitable DME/MRG 
ratio (with increasing amount of MRG) resulted in a higher thermal 
efficiency for HCCI combustion, and a higher overall thermal effi-
ciency can be achieved by using waste heat recovery (WHR) [346].  
2-  Higher compression ratio led to advanced ignition timing, but with 
higher heat transfer (cooling) loss [346] due to the small quenching 
distance  and  fast  burning  velocity  of  hydrogen  content  in  MRG 
(syngas) [353].  

3-  While both H2 and CO have influence on retarding the second stage 
HR, the role of H2 is much more intense due to having a larger effect 
on  first  stage  HR  by  consuming  the  OH  radical  [347].  Also,  com-
bustion of hydrogen during LTHR is controlled by H + O2 → OH + O 
and  less  reactive  HO2  [349].  CO2  also  caused  a  slight  retardation 
[348].  

4-  Despite larger amounts of H2 being useful for ignition control effects, 

H2 has a lower effect on WHR.  

5-  Highest  overall  thermal  efficiency  was  expected  from  thermal 
decomposition  [350]  and  highest  output  would  be  from  steam 
reforming, which resulted in MRG with higherH2 content. 

A collection of works [354–356], which have studied use of a cata-
lytic reforming reactor in the exhaust stream of a natural gas HCCI en-
gine, have shown that hydrogen-rich gas could be a substitute for intake 
preheating  for  the  same  emitted  NOx,  greatly  benefiting  low  engine 
loads. These works have been expanded to form on-board fuel reforming 
strategies, which are called reformed exhaust gas recirculation (R-EGR), 
as described in the next section. Those works concluded that employing

with  using  the  supercharging  and  high  internal  EGR  technologies  for 
increasing  the  upper  load-limit  could  be  a  solution  for  extending  the 
entire  operating  window  of  HCCI  engines  fueled  with  natural  gas  or

At the University of Alberta, a series of research works have been 
experimentally  conducted  to  capture  the  effect  of  reformer  gas  (RG) 
blending  on  the  base  fuels,  including  high-octane  primary  reference 
fuels  (PRF)  [358],  low-octane  PRF  [359],  natural  gas  [360,361], 
n-heptane  [361,362],  and  iso-octane [361]  in  a  variable  compression 
ratio, single-cylinder CFR engine operated in the HCCI mode. The effect 
∗ 100)  was  studied,  while 
of  varying  RG  blend  fraction  (
intake  temperature,  air-fuel  ratio,  and  EGR  were  kept  constant.  For 
low-octane PRF, such as PRF0 (i.e., 100% n-heptane) and PRF20 (i.e., 
20% iso-octane and 80% n-heptane), it was observed, in conformity with 
the above discussion, that increasing values of RG replacement leads to a 
retarded and prolonged combustion event even after TDC [359]. As a 
reported case, 20% of RG replacement delayed the start of combustion 
(SOC) by about 14 CAD (3 ms) and lengthened the combustion duration 
by 50%, and increased the indicated power and thermal efficiencies by 
17%  and  12%,  respectively.  This  remarks  that  combustion  can  be 
controlled by syngas without using other strategies like preheating the 
intake  charge,  adjusting  dilution  level  or  EGR,  and  by  using  valving 
strategies,  which  do  have  slow  response  or  penalty  in  engine  power. 
They also applied a similar procedure to high-octane PRF [358], PRF80 
and  PRF100,  except  by  increasing  CR  and  intake  temperature  (from 
100
C).  Fig.  32  displays  representative  in-cylinder  pressure 
traces and their corresponding heat release. As can be seen, the peak 
in-cylinder pressure and pressure rise rate were reduced by increasing 
the  RG,  with  peak  pressure  shifting  from  approximately  TDC  to 
approximately  10
ATDC.  RG  substitution  effectively  smoothed  com-
bustion by retarding the combustion phasing towards a more efficient 
timing for HCCI combustion, and by widening the combustion duration. 
Replacing RG did not impact NOx emissions but increased CO and HC 
marginally, therefore, with a slight decrease in combustion efficiency. 
The indicated fuel conversion efficiency was slightly increased, because 
the combustion phasing was better than the baseline case. It was found 
that 40% of RG blended in a PRF80 fuel (by mass) has an octane number 
as close as PRF100, but with totally different combustion characteristics. 
Thus,  the  calculated  octane  number  is  not  a  good  indicator  of  the 
characteristics of HCCI combustion.

Later in 2008, the same researchers [361] examined the effects of 
varying  simulated  RG  compositions  on  HCCI  combustion  timing  with 
natural gas, iso-octane, and n-heptane. The RG compositions chosen had 
H2/CO  ratios  of  3/1  (H2/CO=75/25  %by  volume)  and  1/1 
(H2/CO=50/50 %by vol.). The first and latter are a typical output of 
natural  gas  steam  reforming  and  gasoline  partial  oxidation  in  an 
on-board fuel reformer, respectively. Fig. 33 reveals the impact of two 
selected  RG  compositions  on  ITE  and  SOC  for  selected  fuels.  For 
iso-octane, both compositions retarded the combustion timing similarly 
(i.e., +1.5 CAD per each 10% of RG); which implies that iso-octane may 
behave more sensitively to the thermal effect than the chemical effect of 
the H2 content in RG. Also, at the same IMEP, the RG 75/25 moved the 
mixtures towards the richer region compared to the RG 50/50, which 
was operated at the leaner condition. Fig. 33(a) shows the ITE with the 
expanded rich-limit of RG75/25 decreased, presumably due to increased 
heat  transfer  losses.  For  natural  gas,  both  compositions  advanced  the 
combustion timing with no obvious discrepancy by increasing the spe-
cific heat ratio and compression temperature of the mixture. The sup-
porting modeling studies showed that the thermal effect is dominant, 
and the chemical effect arising from the various compositions used has 
an insignificant effect. Also, ITE with RG75/50 is increased due to H2 
properties in extending the lean limit of the mixture (see Fig. 33(c)). 

For n-heptane, both compositions retarded the combustion timing by 
suppressing  the  LTHR  stage  (see  Fig.  33(e)),  in  which  H2  indicates  a 
stronger effect than CO (see Fig. 34). Indicated efficiency of the RG 75/ 
25 fueling decreased after reaching an RG fraction of 10%, staying away 
from optimal combustion phasing of n-heptane, with more retardation 
(see Fig. 33(b)). 

Thus, it is evident that RG with emphasis on the H2 content acts as an 
LTHR  inhibitor  (chemical  effect)  due  to  its  participation  in  low  tem-
perature oxidation for fuels having two-stage heat releases like n-hep-
tane, PRFs, and DME. In this regard, Gou et al. experimentally [364] and 
numerically [365] studied the thermal, chemical, and dilution effects of 
hydrogen enrichment on HCCI fueled with n-heptane. Recently, based 
on  numerical  validation  against  experimental  data  acquired  from  the 
work of Hosseini and Checkel [358,359], multi-zone modeling studies 
with  detailed  chemical  kinetics  and  with  artificial  inert  species  have 
been  carried  out  to  assist  in  the  fundamental  understanding  of  the 
chemical, dilution, and thermal effects of RG blending on the base fuels 
during the HCCI combustion [363,366-370]. For n-heptane [370] and 
low-PRF fuels [368], the dominance of the chemical effect among other

effects on retarding the SOC was confirmed, mostly due to H2 presence 
in low-temperature oxidation reactions during the negative coefficient 
temperature or NTC (period between LTHR and HTHR). For high PRF 
fuels, the dilution effect increases by increasing the PRF number [368]. 

Table 10 summarizes the main syngas works on HCCI engines pub-
lished in the literature. Syngas as a primary fuel of an HCCI engine has

compression ratios, hindering it from progress in vehicular engines. In 
contrast, syngas as a fuel additive can support the HCCI combustion of 
other  fuels  to  push  its  operating  window  to  a  broader  range  with 
attainable high thermal efficiency comparable to that of SI combustion. 
Briefly, syngas addition can be regarded as a  means of extending the 
lean- or the rich-side of the operating equivalence ratio of HCCI com-
bustion fueled with low- and high- octane fuels, respectively. 

3.3. Syngas in dual-fuel engines 

Stable combustion of a premixed syngas-air mixture is problematic in 
CI engines due to the low reactivity and high auto-ignition temperature 
◦
(> 500 
C) of syngas [59]. Also, more stringent diesel engine emissions 
regulations  have  directed  research  towards  further  development  of 
advanced  combustion  engines.  Meanwhile,  dual-fuel  operation 
[379–381]  with  a  premixed  fuel  and  pilot-injected  diesel  has  shown 
interesting  advantages  in  terms  of  efficiency  and  emissions  over 

conventional diesel  combustion (CDC). Similar to compressed natural 
gas  (CNG)  and  liquefied  petroleum  gas  (LPG)  [382],  syngas  is  also  a 
good  candidate  for  the  premixed  fuel  in  dual  fuel  mode  owing  to  its 
variable  composition,  flexible  feedstocks,  and  possibility  of  on-board 
production  on  a  vehicle  [383,384].  In  this  part,  syngas  utilization  in 
dual-fuel combustion is analyzed and reviewed in detail. 

3.3.1. Diesel/syngas engine performance and emissions 

Several studies have been focused on using syngas in dual-fuel con-
cepts, where diesel is directly injected into the cylinder as a pilot fuel to 
initiate the ignition, while syngas is introduced into the intake port as a 
premixed fuel. Syngas application in diesel engines as a secondary en-
ergy carrier has been considered to be a promising alternative method 
mainly for emissions reduction. In the early stages of the research, ef-
forts were dedicated to clarifying and distinguishing dual-fuel combus-
tion from CDC, which led to the recognition of two-stage combustion for 
dual  fueling  at  higher  engine  loads.  Specifically,  Garnier  et  al.  [385] 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience90(2022)10099532A. Paykani et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                

established  a  predictive  model  to  determine  the  ignition  delay  and 
combustion of a syngas/diesel CI engine, based on an empirical model 
and  three  Wiebe  functions  (for  pilot-fuel,  gaseous-fuel,  and  diffusive 
combustions)  calibrated  with  experimental  data.  After  that,  some  ex-
periments  were  conducted  to  characterize  syngas/diesel  dual-fuel 
combustion in terms of engine performance and emissions by varying 
syngas compositions. Sahoo et al. [386] evaluated the dual-fuel concept 
using syngas with a H2/CO ratio = 1/1 by volume in a single-cylinder 
◦
diesel  engine  at  a  constant  1500  rpm  and  injection  timing  of  23
BTDC by altering the load from 0 to 100%. Compared to the diesel-only 
mode, a lower BTE with a peak reduction of 21% at 80% load, increased 
◦
C), increased CO and HC emissions for 
exhaust gas temperature (50-100
all engine loads were observed; however, both NOx emissions and peak 
cylinder pressure were decreased. Also, by varying H2/CO’s volumetric 
ratio  during  various  loads  [387],  the  maximum  HC,  CO,  and  CO2 
emissions  and  minimum  BTE  occurred  with  100%  CO;  however,  the 
opposite behavior was observed with 100%H2  [388]. Moreover, from 
the  second  law  efficiency  point  of  view,  the  same  authors  [389] 
concluded that a syngas/diesel CI engine’s theoretical performance fa-
vors higher load (beyond 40% load) over lower loads, where the exergy 
destruction increases due to the heat transfer losses, see Fig. 35 (right). 
Bika  et  al.  [390]  experimentally  assessed  the  cycle  efficiency  of  a 
single-cylinder syngas/diesel engine for four diesel substitutions of 0% 
(diesel-only baseline case), 10%, 20%, and 40%, at two net IMEPs of 2 
and 4 bar, see Fig. 35 (left). Bottled gases of H2  and CO with varying 
proportions  (H2/CO:  100/0,  75/25,  25/75,  and  0/100  by  %volume) 
were used to simulate syngas. Compared to the diesel baseline case, they 
displayed  lowered  efficiencies  at  both  loads  (10-25%  for  2  bar  and 
5-17% for 4 bar IMEP), presumably attributed to the unburned syngas 
discharged  in  the  exhaust  stream.  Moreover,  NOx  emissions  were 
increased for all syngas proportions at 4 bar IMEP. 

So  far,  syngas/diesel  dual  fuel  operation  findings  have  shown  a 
common trend of efficiency degradation particularly at low- and part- 
engine loads with the decrease in combustion efficiency being due to 
increased H2 and CO. Wagemakers and Leermakers [382] reviewed the 
comparison of dual fueling of diesel with various gaseous fuels like CNG, 
LPG, syngas, and hydrogen. They reported that all gaseous fuels could 
reduce soot emissions except for syngas. As a consequence of the dual 
fuel mode for diesel substitution, methane demonstrated better perfor-
mance  than  syngas.  The  drawbacks  generally  reported  from  engines 
operating on gaseous fuels/diesel at part loads are excessive HC and CO 
emissions,  and  high  fuel  consumption,  resulting  in  lower  combustion 
efficiency and low thermal efficiency [391]. Also, a  recent review on 
natural gas (NG)/diesel engines reported the same trend with up to a 
2.1%  fall  in  engine  power  and  low  BTE  at  low-to-part  engine  loads, 
while a maximum rise of 3% at high loads would be attainable compared 
to  the  diesel  engine  [392].  The  only  reported  solution  to  the  stated 
problems was to increase the H2  content of the syngas, while the pilot 

injection  strategy  has  not  received  much  attention.  It  is  also  worth 
noting  that  higher  efficiency  with  H2/diesel  dual  operation  than 
diesel-only  operation  has  been  obtained  when  H2  is  injected  directly 
within the cylinder [393,394]. Antunes et al. [393] indicated fuel effi-
ciencies of 34% for H2/diesel and 43% for H2-only compared to 28% for 
the diesel-only case. 

At Okayama University, a group has conducted research on dual-fuel 
operation [395–402] with different producer gas generated by biomass 
gasification (BMG) and coke-oven gasification (COG) in a supercharged, 
single-cylinder diesel engine. They reported performance and emissions 
characteristics of a dual fuel syngas/diesel engine considering the effect 
of pilot injection. Their key findings are summarized below:  

• The  effect  of  injection  pressure  and  amount  of  pilot  fuel  (diesel): 
Smoke emissions were increased with increasing amount of injected 
diesel,  while  decreasing  with  increasing  injection  pressure  (i.e.,  2 
mg/cycle with 400 bar has the same measured smoke with 10 mg/ 
cycle with 800 bar) [395].  

○

• The effect of pilot-injection strategy with timings ranging from 4 to 
12 
BTDC, injection pressures of 40, 60 and 80 bar, pilot quantities of 
2  to  10  mg/cycle:  80  MPa  with  3  mg/cycle  was  optimal  for  best 
performance [396].  

• The lowest energy content PG used showed the lowest level of NOx 
emissions and smoke-free operation with smooth combustion [398].  
• The effect of varying hydrogen content in PGs from 13.7% to 20% by 
volume: High  hydrogen content in syngas led to a wide operating

range (i.e., equivalence ratio) and high thermal efficiency; however, 
increased NOx emissions [397]. 

Following  this  work,  Azimov  et  al.  [403]  suggested  a  novel  com-
bustion strategy with inspiration from the knock event in the end-gas 
regions  of  SI  engines.  The  natural  gas  engine  with  a  homogenous 
air-fuel mixture could be controlled; when natural gas combusts with the 
flame front supported concurrently by pilot-injected diesel fuel, which 
has already been ignited. They called it premixed mixture ignition in the 
end-gas  region  (PREMIER)  combustion;  also,  shifting  from  diffusion 
combustion to flame front combustion for syngas/diesel dual-mode was 
reported in [404]. With the proposed combustion strategy illustrated in 
Fig. 36, the effect of H2 and CO2 content in syngas on the performance 
and  emission  of  a  syngas/diesel  engine  was  investigated  under  lean 
operating  conditions  [401].  PREMIER  combustion  was  observed  pri-
marily when the amount of pilot fuel used was minimal. Additionally, 
they [401] stated that an increase in syngas’s hydrogen content short-
ened  the  main  combustion  period  and  caused  the  mean  combustion 
temperature,  IMEP,  and  efficiency  to  increase.  They  also  found  that 
diesel could not be substituted completely, or syngas could not be used 
as a single fuel in the diesel engine. 

Some other researchers [396,405-409] have explored the feasibility 
of the dual-fuel concept with syngas generated from various sources by 
either  gasification  like  producer  gas  or  on-board  reforming  processes 
like reformer gas. Dohle et al. [409–411] performed a series of experi-
mental  studies  to  investigate  the  combustion  characteristics  of  a 
dual-fuel  diesel  engine  fueled  by  three  cases  of  H2,  PG,  which  was 
generated from rice husk, and PG in combination with H2 (PG + H2) as a 
secondary  fuel.  Fig.  37  (left)  shows  the  thermal  efficiency  variations 
with  five  different combinations  of gaseous  fuel  replacement at  13%, 
40%, and 80 % engine loads. Again, up to 30% load, a decrease of BTE 
was  found  due  to  the  poor  combustion  characteristic  of  low  calorific 
producer  gas  even  in  combination  with  H2  at  low  loads.  While  by 
increasing the total mass quantity of fuel through increasing the engine 
load, the combustion of the dual fuel mode improved due to the higher 
flame velocity and diffusivity of gaseous fuels compared to diesel. As 
compared  to  H2/diesel  and  PG/diesel  cases  (see  Fig.  37  (right)),  H2 

would augment more stability in the flame of the H2+PG/ diesel case, 
presumably attributed to the high stability of H2-air flames while the PG 
flames tend to become unstable. Nevertheless, the increase in H2 from a 
certain amount (here, 40% of H2 in PG/H2 mixture) resulted conversely 
in the destabilization of the flame, which may be attributed to a decrease 
in  the  Markstein  length  [412].  At  higher  loads,  much  oxygen  was 
consumed by PG/H2  while hydrocarbon fuel received not enough oxy-
gen; thus, a reduction in BTE would be sensible. 

Fig. 38 depicts the variation in emissions at 80% load conditions for 
the  three  cases,  with  PG/H2  ratio  of  60:40.  Because  of  the  low  pilot 
quantity, HC emission is high with gaseous fuel replacement at higher 
engine loads. As noted above at higher loads, larger gaseous fuel sub-
stitutions, which replace some of the air during the intake stroke, can 
lead  to  increased  utilization  of  oxygen  and  the  reduction  of  oxygen 
available for further combustion of the pilot diesel fuel, thus raising the 
HC level. Higher CO emissions implies that incomplete combustion and 
burning of lubrication oil take place, together with the lower heating 
value of PG, CO-containing PG (lower mean effective pressure), lower 
adiabatic flame temperature, and lower over-mixing. For the PG case, 
the drop in NOx may be due to the lower adiabatic flame temperature of 
PG and the absence of nitrogen in the PG, as well as a more uniform 
temperature  distribution  achieved  with  the  gaseous  fuel-air  mixture, 
allowing  the  number  of  high-temperature  regions  around  the  diesel 
flame to decrease. 

The  summary  of  relevant  literature  that  has  been  reviewed  so  far 

indicates:  

1-  Feasibility  of  syngas/diesel  among  gaseous  fuels/diesel  as  a  good 
choice for dual-fuel operation: according to all cited work here, while 
it has no beneficial aspects in terms of engine performance, and even 
also emissions, it performs well at low and part loads.  

2-  The influence of syngas compositions confirmed that increasing the 
H2  content  of  the  syngas  has  considerable  merit  in  combustion 
improvement.  

3-  Modifying  the  pilot  injection  strategy  can  be  a  promising  way  of 

extending the prospects of the dual-fuel mode with syngas.

4-  This  concept’s  flexibility  with  a  broad  range  of  synthetic  gases 
derived from varying sources has led to more attention in research. 

The pilot injection strategy of Roy [396], is regarded as a means of 
controlling  the  in-cylinder  reactivity  and  combustion  phasing.  By 
introducing  two  fuels  having  different  reactivity  (i.e.,  low  and  high 
reactivity) with a pair of separate injections for the high-reactivity fuel 
within  the  cylinder  control  can  be  achieved.  This  concept  has  been 
presented by Kokjohn et al. [413], who named it reactivity-controlled 
compression  ignition  (RCCI).  In  terms  of  commercialization,  RCCI 
[380,381,414,415] is under more investigation for single-fuel operation, 
where high reactivity like diesel as the parent fuel, can be converted into 
a  low-reactivity  fuel  by  suitable  in-situ  on-board  fuel  reforming  [34, 
416-424]. 

Rahnama  et  al.  [34]  investigated  the  effects  of  reformer  gas, 
hydrogen,  and  nitrogen  on  the  combustion  characteristics  of  a 
heavy-duty RCCI engine fueled with natural gas/diesel. The impact of 
the introduction of syngas (up to 5%vol) at medium load engine oper-
ation was also investigated. As shown in Fig. 39, by adding syngas, peak 
pressure, combustion, and gross indicated efficiency values significantly 
increase,  but  after  a  certain  point,  the  gross  efficiency  drops  due  to 
improper  phasing  in  combustion  and  heat  release  during  the 

compression stroke. With respect to emissions, the introduction of syn-
gas increases NOx emissions due to the higher temperature induced by 
the  higher  adiabatic  flame  temperatures  of  carbon  monoxide  and 
hydrogen. It also decreases soot emissions, due to the higher tempera-
ture of combustion resulting from the hydrogen content of the syngas, 
which allows soot oxidation. It is also confirmed in a recent study by 
Zhong et al. [425] that hydrogen in syngas promotes NOx emission but 
suppresses soot emission. Even though HC and CO emissions at medium 
load operation are relatively low, syngas addition slightly reduces HC 
emissions and increases CO emissions due to the syngas CO content, as 
depicted in Fig. 40. In another work, Rahnama et al. [418] numerically 
studied the effects of reformer gas composition (3% syngas enrichment 
of intake air) on the combustion and emission characteristics of a natural 
gas/diesel RCCI engine at a low load condition. They observed that with 
increasing CO fraction in the syngas, peak pressure, ringing intensity, 
and  pressure  rise  rate  increased  significantly.  Using  a  mixture  with  a 
higher CO content, a shorter ignition delay and combustion time and 
advanced CA50 were achieved. These were interesting results but was 
attributed to the lower cylinder temperatures as a result of using lower 
intake temperatures with high-H2 syngas. 

Chuahy and Kokjohn [416] were the first to experimentally examine 
the  effect of varying  syngas composition  on a  single-fuel RCCI fueled

and the combustion phasing (at -0.3

authors  indicated  that  syngas  with  high  H2  content  suppresses  the

tical  effect  on  the  engine’s  gross  indicated  efficiency.  Moreover,  as 
shown  in  Fig.  42,  the  effect  of  syngas  replacement  by  energy  on  the

shaded regions, which is ± standard deviation. 

In  light  of  the  integration  of  single-fuel  RCCI  with  varying  fuel 
reforming reactions, work by Chuahy and Kokjohn [417] has shown that 
reformate  generation  from  all  reactions,  including  steam  reforming, 
partial oxidation, and auto-thermal, have the capability of raising the 
net indicated efficiency of the engine by 4% compared to that of con-
ventional diesel. The steam reforming case had the highest system effi-
ciency if exhaust energy recovery was enabled. Further, it was reported 
[426] that the engine-reformer system with endothermic reforming has 
comparable  efficiency  to  a  conventional  diesel  engine  at  equal 
tailpipe-out NOx and negligible soot emissions; lower hydrogen to car-
bon ratios allows to achieve more engine-reformer efficiency. 

By utilizing a thermally integrated R-EGR reactor (see the next sec-
tion), single-fuel RCCI operation in a light-duty diesel engine was ach-
ieved by Hwang et al. [427]. Data were collected over a range of EGRs 
and  main  diesel  injection  timings  at  a  constant  fuel  flow  rate.  The 
analysis indicated that RCCI is achievable with low efficiency in reactor 
conversion  as  long  as  reformate  produced  has  reasonably  small  reac-
tivity compared to diesel. The results also showed that while operating 
the reformer at a lower equivalence ratio resulted in higher hydrogen 
production, ignition was significantly delayed at achievable diesel in-
jection timings. This work showed that while single-fuel RCCI is possible 
using  an  R-EGR  diesel  engine  design,  more  research  is  required  to 
optimize the system in order to reach the efficiency and emission rates 
achieved by dual-fuel RCCI engines. 

3.3.2. Biofuels/syngas engine performance and emissions 

Vegetable  oils  such  as  honge,  rice  bran,  and  neem  oils  have  been 
investigated for their suitability as diesel engine fuels [428] due to being 
renewable, non-toxic, and biodegradable. Many researchers have per-
formed tests on CI and dual-fuel engines with different vegetable oils at 
different operating condition. Banapurmath et al. [429–432] studied the 
combustion  characteristics  of  a  CI  engine  operated  on  the  dual-fuel 
mode with PG as the premixed fuel and honge oil and its methyl ester 
(HOME) as the injected fuels (liquid pilot fuels). Fig. 43 represents heat 
release rate comparisons for the dual-fuel mode at optimum injection 
timings  for  the  selected  fuel  combinations.  It  was  observed  that  the 
premixed  burning  phase  associated  with  a  higher  heat  release  rate  is 
significant with diesel–PG dual-fuel mode leading to the higher thermal 
efficiency  of  diesel–PG  operation.  Furthermore,  the  diffusion  burning 
process indicated under the second peak was higher for honge oil-PG 
and  HOME-PG  than  diesel-PG  dual  fuel  operation,  which  is  in  agree-
ment with the effects of the viscosity of vegetable oils on the fuel spray 
and  reduced  air  entrainment  and  lower  fuel-air  mixing  rates.  Higher 
exhaust temperatures and lower thermal efficiency were noticed with

gas  at  optimum  injection  timings  (Reprinted  from  [429]  with  permission 
of Elsevier). 

honge oil–PG due to the significantly higher combustion rates during the 
later  stages.  However,  HOME–PG  operation  showed  improvement  in 
heat release rate compared to neat honge oil–PG dual-fuel operation. 

Yaliwal  et  al.  [51,433-438]  increased  the  fuel  efficiency  of  a 
single-cylinder,  dual-fuel  DI 
stationary  diesel  engine  using 
HOME-Bioethanol  (BE)  blends,  such  as  HOME+5%  bioethanol  (BE5), 
HOME+10%  bioethanol  (BE10)  and  HOME+15%  bioethanol  (BE15). 
Fig.  44  depicts  in-cylinder  pressure  versus  crank  angle  for  diesel-PG, 
HOME-PG, and HOME+ bioethanol-PG combinations at a load level of 
80%. The cylinder pressure was determined to depend on the combus-
tion rate, the type of combinations of fuel utilized, and how much of the 
fuel is involved in the rapid combustion cycle. Lower cylinder pressure 
was  observed  for  the  combination  of  HOME  –PG  and  HOME+ bio-
ethanol  –  PG  compared  to  the  combination  of  diesel–PG,  due  to  the 
combined impact of the lower heating value of the blends and PG and 
the  longer  ignition  delay  due  to  inadequate  mixing  with  the 
slow-burning nature of the PG. Nonetheless, for the BE5–PG combina-
tion, a significantly higher in-cylinder pressure was observed compared 
with the combinations of HOME–PG, BE10-PG, and BE15–PG. This may 
be attributable to the BE5 blend’s improved spray properties. Further-
more,  when  PG  is  present,  a  higher  blend  of  bioethanol  with  HOME 
lowers the energy content for dual-fuel operation. 

Overall, experimental work on the dual-fuel engine utilizing BE5-PG 
operation resulted in up to 4-9% increased BTE with reduced HC, CO 
emissions, and slightly equivalent NOx emissions compared to HOME- 
PG, BE10-PG, and BE15-PG modes. However, the overall performance 
of BE-PG operation was lower compared to diesel-PG operation. 

Later  in  2018  [439],  the  same  group  compared  the  performance, 
combustion,  and  emission  characteristics  of  a  single-cylinder,  DI  sta-
tionary diesel engine operated in dual fuel mode with a combination of 
HOME and the gaseous fuels CNG, HCNG, and PG. The combined effect 
of poor mixture preparation, longer ignition delay, lower heating value, 
and adiabatic flame temperature (1800 K) and slowing burning velocity 
nature  of  the  PG  (50  cm/s)  resulted  in  the  lower  peak  pressure  and 
lowered  rate  of  pressure  rise  for  HOME–PG  operation  compared  to 
HOME–CNG/HCNG operation. 

Carlucci  et  al.  [440–442]  studied  the  improvements  in  dual-fuel 
biodiesel-producer gas combustion seen at low loads through pilot in-
jection  splitting.  Utilizing  a  common-rail  injection,  single-cylinder 
research  diesel  engine  fitted  with  a  high-pressure  common  rail  injec-
tion  system  controlled  in  dual-fuel  mode,  they  measured  changes 
resulting  from  splitting  of  the  liquid  fuel  injection.  In  this  case,  the 
inducted gaseous fuel was a synthetic PG, while biodiesel was utilized as 
the  pilot  fuel.  The  experimental  campaign  was  split  into  two  parts, 
running on engine speed at 1500 rpm. First, only one pilot injection of 
constant fuel quantity (11 mm3/cycle) was used, the rail pressure was 
set at 500 or 1000 bar, while the quantity of gaseous fuel produced in the 
cylinder was varied on three stages. Second, splitting pilot injection was 
shown to be an efficient way to increase the efficiency of fuel conversion 
and to reduce the levels of all polluting emissions compared to the single 
pilot strategy. Based on the comprehensive experimental tests, a dwell 
ranging from 10 to 30 degrees of crank angle combined with a first in-
jection  timing  varying  from  35  to  20  degrees  of  crank  angle  BTDC 
allowed the highest fuel conversion efficiency and the lowest emission 
levels.  The  injection  pressure  was  verified  to  be  a  significant  factor 
affecting  the  development  of  combustion,  while  the  gaseous  mass 
inducted  in  the  cylinder  determined  a  side  effect  in  terms  of  oxygen 
depletion. Eventually, pilot injection splitting proved to be an efficient 
way  to  boost  the  combustion  of  gaseous  fuel  under  low  load  (lean 
mixture) conditions in the dual-fuel system. Kan et al. [443] simulated 
the combustion and emission performance of three dual-fuel strategies 
for utilizing the syngas and biodiesel produced from the biomass wastes, 
namely  syngas-biodiesel,  hydrogen-enriched  syngas-biodiesel  and 
DME-biodiesel 
the 
KIVA-CHEMKIN  code.  It  was  found  that  syngas-biodiesel  and 
hydrogen-enriched syngas-biodiesel cases can improve the combustion 

ignition  engine  using 

in  a  compression

and had higher indicated power at high engine loads of 50% and 100%. 
The DME-biodiesel case was advantageous for the combustion at 10% 
load comparing to the other two cases. With the increase in fuel sup-
plement ratio, the soot emission generally showed a decreasing trend at 
all engine loads for all three strategies. 

Table 11 summarizes the main syngas combustion works on dual fuel 

engines published in the literature. 

3.4. Syngas contaminants in IC engines 

There are two sources of contaminants leading to deposit formation 

after running the engine with syngas fuels:  

1-  Impurities that originate from the production method,  
2-  Changing syngas composition during the storage process. 

Impurities  in  biomass  feedstocks  and  partial  gasification  lead  to 
contaminants in syngas, which are mainly classified as tars, PM, alkali, 
nitrogen (NH3), Sulphur (H2S), halides, and trace elements [451]. These 
contaminants are responsible for downstream problems in the gasifier, 
such  as  corrosion,  clogging,  and  catalyst  deactivation  [61,452-455]. 
Syngas produced from biomass gasification should be refined to remove 
condensable tars prior to using it as a fuel for IC engines [456]. Syngas 
impurities  affect  engine  performance  for  all  types  of  IC  engines,  but 
there are few studies in the literature on this. Bhaduri et al. [329,331, 
376]  developed  a  tar  tolerant  system,  wherein  syngas  with  tar 
contamination  was  used  as  a  fuel  for  an  HCCI  engine  where  intake 
temperatures  were  set  to  be  above  the  tar  dew  point  to  prevent 
condensation  of  tars.  They  noticed  that  the  moisture  content  of  the 
syngas adversely affects combustion efficiency. In addition, the results 
demonstrated that the introduction of tars leads to an increase in the 
LHV without affecting the timing of combustion for neat syngas opera-
tion. In another work, Bhaduri et al. [330] carried out experiments using 
an impure and hot biomass syngas burned in an HCCI engine without the 
intermediate cooling and tar purification steps to test the engine’s sta-
bility in response to naturally occurring random variations in the syngas 
composition. Minimal tar deposits were found due to the use of a low tar 
gasifier after 24 h of operation (see Fig. 45). Besides, brown discolor-
ation from some deposits was observed on the piston and cylinder heads, 
which was attributed to the regular oil-related deposits. 

In the second case, Hagos et al. [457] ran a DISI engine with various 
syngas  compositions  free  of  tar  and  periodically  checked  the  fuel 
injector, spark plug, piston, cylinder head, and valve seats during the 
engine shutdown. Deposit formation was visibly observed on the surface 
of  the  injection  tip,  turning  the  color  glow  red,  as  can  be  seen  from 
Fig. 46 (left). While a similar deposit color was also seen in other engine 

components, as shown in Fig. 46 (right), such deposits have never been 
found when running the engine with CNG, hydrogen, or a combination 
of them. It was pointed out that producer gas with light tar compounds 
as fuel has less impact on the deposit formation [458], although neither 
the effect of engine hours running nor the effect of syngas composition 
on the deposit quantity were investigated. The deposit characterization 
revealed that reacting the CO content in syngas with the metallic wall of 
storage tanks at high pressure may result in metallic carbonyl contam-
inants such as iron pentacarbonyl (Fe(CO)5) in the syngas, which in turn 
participates  in  the  engine’s  combustion.  Before  deposit  formation,  as 
mentioned in section 2.4, these components also affect the ignition delay 
and laminar flame speed of the whole combustion process. Besides, such 
metallic  carbonyl  could  be  generated  during  syngas  production  via 
gasification. Consequently, extra attention should be paid to the design 
of syngas production and storage systems. 

4. Syngas from on-board fuel reforming in IC engines 

A study by Yang et al. [459] reported that syngas could be stored 
◦
under pressures as high as p=83 bar and temperatures of T = -15
C to 
◦
45
C.  However,  with  on-board syngas  production, the  storage-related 
issues such as the demand for a large storage tank due to the low en-
ergy density of the syngas and the syngas contaminants (see Section 3.4) 
can be eliminated. This section provides a comprehensive overview of 
previous research on on-board fuel reforming and syngas production in 
IC  engines.  Regarding  the  vehicular  applications,  the  fuel  reforming 
process  can  be  achieved  either  inside  cylinders  (i.e.,  in-cylinder  fuel 
reforming) or outside the engine cylinders (i.e., external fuel reforming). 
In-cylinder reforming methods are a preventive measure to achieve a 
more efficient engine by increasing thermal efficiency, reducing energy 
content in the engine’s exhaust stream. In contrast, external reforming 
methods are a corrective one to a lower engine efficiency by capturing 
the  exhaust  gas  energy  via  placing  a  WHR  device  (reformer)  in  the 
exhaust stream. Both methods are considered as thermochemical recu-
peration  (TCR)  technologies  [460–462],  which  can  be  more  efficient 
than thermomechanical methods [463] such as turbo-compounding and 
bottoming cycles because the energy transfer is not bounded by isen-
tropic  expansion  and  Carnot  efficiency.  Additionally,  there  is  no  sig-
nificant modification needed in the design of production engines. Fig. 47 
shows the schematic of the mentioned techniques by classification, and 
they are reviewed in detail in the following sections.

fuel  for  the reformer  is  supplied from the  engine’s  main fuel, and  no 
relationship exists between the reformer and engine exhaust in terms of

and  CO by  about 80% and  40%, respectively. Kirwan et  al. [465],  at 
Delphi  automotive,  also  established  an  intake-side,  external  POX 
reformer to convert a fraction of gasoline at rich conditions to reformate 
by catalytic reforming; then, the reformate was split into separate in-
jections, a portion into the cylinder and the rest into the exhaust stream, 
resulting in a reduction of both engine-out and tailpipe emissions during 
cold-start. Another study [466] proposed an on-board water electrolysis 
system to reduce fuel consumption of the SI engine fueled with ethanol 
and gasoline at the idle condition. 

The most significant way of producing reformate from this category 
is partial oxidation because of its inherently fast start-up and shut-down, 
rapid response to transient loads, and high hydrogen production, but at 
the expense of a drop in the reforming process efficiency, which should 
be offset by the increased engine thermal efficiency. Overall, enhance-
ment in engine-reformer efficiency was reported for motorcycle appli-
cations assisted with plasma converter [467,468]. 

more stringent emission standards are in progress. 

Plasma reforming: 
Plasma-assisted fuel reforming is a technique to generate hydrogen- 
rich gas on-board the vehicle by supplying a small fraction of the main 
fuel  stream  to  a  device  where  fuel  and  air  are  converted  to  a  stream 
containing the syngas by POX process, and then mixed with the main 
intake  air/fuel  charge  for  SI  and  HCCI  combustion  improvements  or 
directly applied to exhaust aftertreatment systems for a NOx trap [469] 
or for diesel particulate filter (DPF) regeneration [470], as demonstrated 
in  Fig.  48.  The  device,  which  was  initially  developed  and  tested  by 
Bromberg  et  al.  [471,472]  at  the  Plasma  Science  and  Fusion  Center 
(PSFC) of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and they called it 
“Plasmatron”, can be categorized into thermal and non-thermal plasma 
reformers, depending on how electrical power input transfers from the 
electric  field  to  plasma  components  including  electrons,  ions,  neutral 
gases to form and maintain plasma [473]. 

Briefly,  although  these  on-board  reforming  processes  could  be 
operated independently of the engine condition (as a positive point), the 
complexity and extra costs bring additional issues. It is worth noting that 
developments in the aftertreatment systems following the adoption of 

In thermal plasma reformers, the plasma energy input supplied by a 
DC source creates a small region with an extremely high temperature (in 
the range of 5000 to 10000K) to heat the electrons and the other plasma 
components, such that temperatures reach thermal equilibrium. While

the provided high-temperature environment, along with created plasma 
heating,  boost  the  slow  reaction  rates  associated  with  POX  reactions, 
irrelevant inert species (such as N2) are also heated, meaning that much- 
unused energy is wasted through this non-selective way. On the other 
hand,  in  non-thermal  plasma  reformers,  only  the  electrons  have  very 
high temperatures; however, the other components are relatively cold 
(near room temperature) and capable of absorbing and storing energy to 
efficiently  produce  locally  highly  reactive  species  to  perform  fuel 
reforming at low temperatures. Due to this behavior acting as a catalyst, 
many  researchers  believe  that  non-thermal  plasma  reforming  has 
inherent catalysis effects that are fundamentally yet unknown [84]. 

Rabinovich et al. [474] developed a high current (>10 A), thermal 
compact Plasmatron reformer to convert various fuels, namely biofuels, 
gasoline, and diesel, into H2-rich gas, and also integrated it with an SI 
engine  fueled  with  methane  [475]  and  gasoline  [476]  to  investigate 
engine performance, NOx emissions, and engine-reformer interactions. 
They succeeded to potentially apply the compact Plasmatron to IC en-
gine,  resulting  in  substantial  NOx  emissions  reductions  but  at  the 
expense  of 
the  high  overall 
engine-reformer  efficiency  cost,  and  possibly  lower  electrode  lifetime 
[477]. Besides, as seen in Fig. 49(left), they needed two or more chan-
nels in which water flows for electrode cooling prohibit electrodes from 
erosion. 

the  high  power 

requirement, 

To overcome thermal compact Plasmatron-related issues, the same 
authors developed a low current (<120 mA) version of that through the 
non-thermal  plasma  generation  mechanism,  as  indicated  in  Fig.  52 
(right) [470]. A wide range of fuels such as heavy hydrocarbons, alco-
hols [478], and renewable fuels [479] can be used with different types of 
non-thermal plasma reformers. 

It’s worth noting that due to developing an understanding of plasma- 
chemistry interaction mechanisms, the role of plasma, specifically the 
non-equilibrium one, in combustion enhancement by assisting ignition 
and flame stabilization has been drawing more attention than the low- 
temperature  fuel  reforming  application  in  recent  years.  For  instance, 
microwave non-equilibrium plasma could enhance an ignitor such as the 
spark  plug  of  SI  engines  to  initiate  a  sufficiently  large  flame  kernel, 
which in turn causes lean limit extensions by maintaining nearly con-
stant combustion variability by increasing the air-to-fuel ratio, in addi-
tion  to  the  observed  improvements  in  fuel  consumption  and  CO 
emissions. This is beyond the current review’s scope, but in this regard, 
two critical and comprehensive reviews have been published [480,481]. 
Several studies were also conducted to mimic the Plamsatron-generated 
reformate in gasoline engines through simulated gases using bottled gas 
[305,482,483] with a typical reformate composition consisting of 25% 
H2, 26%CO, and 42%N2, which indicated an improvement of about 12% 

in engine efficiency at partial loads. 

In  short,  plasma-assisted  reformers  have  shown  vastly  superior 
characteristics  compared  to  traditional  catalytic  reformers,  including 
fast  response,  rapid  startup,  fuel  flexibility,  size  requirements,  and 
absence of sulfur and soot as bi-products. Nevertheless, they deteriorate 
the  vehicle’s  overall  power  output  by  about  2%,  as  the  engine  must 
provide  the  electrical  power.  Additionally,  they  are  immature  for  IC 
engine  applications  since  plasma  technology  is  still  being  under 
development. 

4.1.2. Exhaust gas fuel reforming 

Since in an IC engine approximately about 30% of the fuel’s energy is 
lost  through  hot  exhaust  gases,  utilizing  a  part  of  these  hot  gases  for 
providing heat and the reactants required, along with a portion of engine 
fuel for an exhaust gas fuel reformer placed inside the EGR loop, can 
result in reformate having higher enthalpy than the base fuel, as seen in 
Fig. 50. Reformate mixed with the rest of the EGR (in total, reformed 
exhaust gas recirculation or R-EGR) is fed back to the intake manifold to 
run  the engine  similar to a  dual-fuel (the base  fuel + R-EGR (EGR +
Reformate)) engine. The same concept with varying configurations has 
been investigated by several researchers, as seen in Fig. 50. Because of 
using a catalyst to convert the fuel, it is also called on-board catalytic 
reforming. 

◦

Catalyst considerations: 
The catalyst formulation determines the catalyst activity and resis-
tance  to  deactivation  due  to  carbon  deposition,  and  reformer  design 
affects catalyst temperature; therefore, both influence reformer perfor-
mance  and  reformate  product.  An  earlier  work  [489]  on  an  R-EGR 
reformer  with  a  gasoline  SI  engine  exhibited  poor  performance  at 
moderate temperatures (T=600-650 
C) as compared with values pre-
dicted by thermodynamic equilibrium, resulting in a low concentration 
of hydrogen (2-5%). This low fuel conversion was mostly attributable to 
the  inactivity  of  the  catalyst  that  was  however  not  specified  in  that 
study. Recent works by Gomez et al. [490,491] showed that high activity 
of  precious  metal  catalysts,  e.g.,  1  wt%  rhodium  (Rh)  supported  on 
zirconia, can bring yields near equilibrium for a given fuel conversion 
rate by  preventing methanation  reactions at typical  exhaust tempera-
tures of a gasoline engine. The study revealed that increased fuel con-
version  occurred  with  higher  catalyst  mass  and  temperature  (see 
Fig. 51). A 10% drop was also observed in hydrogen production when 
increasing pressure from p=1 to 1.3 bar. In a current configuration, the 
exhaust gas reformer is placed after the TWC in the exhaust gas system 
[492],  and  achievable  hydrogen  and  CO  yields  were  in  the  range  of 
5-10%.; another current (and more complex) layout [487] is that the 
reformer is positioned close to the exhaust manifold, as will be discussed

conditions.  Efficient  TCR  with  a  high  heating  value  reformate  occurs 
when all reactions are eventually net endothermic; therefore, the target 
is  to  maximize  endothermic  reforming  reactions,  primarily  dry  and 
steam reforming. Nevertheless, the low temperature of the exhaust at 
low engine loads cannot drive endothermic reactions alone; thus, in this 
case, partial and complete oxidation reactions are useful to provide the 
heat  required  to  achieve  the  reforming  process  and  the  likelihood  of 
tailpipe-out emission reduction, with the possibility of heat loss. Hence, 
the  exhaust  gas  fuel  reformer  may  act  like  an  auto-thermal  reformer 
(ATR)  without  needing  a  separate  water  tank  and  air  supply  system. 
Recently,  Tartakovsky  and  Sheintuch  [33]  thoroughly  reviewed  this 
concept  and  we  would  recommend  to  refer  to  this  paper  for  more 
information. 

IC engine considerations: 
Incorporating the exhaust gas fuel reformer at various engine oper-
ating points at different combustion modes, including CI [495–502], SI 
[484,489],  HCCI  [356,498,503],  and  partially  premixed  compression 
ignition  (PCCI)  [504]  to  produce  R-EGR  reformate  has  been  widely 
investigated at the University of Birmingham over the last two decades; 
and more recently with a gasoline direct injection (GDI) engine reported 
in [100,492,505-510]. 

A  series  of  studies  on  diesel  engines  integrated  with  a  prototype 
exhaust gas fuel reformer (see Fig. 52 (left)) has been done with precious 
metal catalysts. Tsolakis et al. [496] employed this reformer whereby 
direct catalytic reforming of diesel is performed with the exhaust gas of a 
single-cylinder diesel engine operating at part load. They achieved up to 
16% hydrogen content in the R-EGR products for a reformer inlet tem-
◦
perature of T=290
C. They also indicated that the use of R-EGR shifted 
the traditional NOx-smoke trade-off curve to lower values and lowered 
the incremental slope of smoke as compared to conventional EGR, as 
depicted in Fig. 52 (right). The same author [499] externally heated a 
diesel  oxidation  catalyst  (DOC)  Pt/AL2O3  at  the  temperature  of 
◦
T=250
C (same condition as the engine running at 1800 rpm and 25% 
load) and then added R-EGR products to the engine intake manifold with 
reduced diesel fuel injected in order to maintain the engine condition 
constant at low load. They found that poor use of gaseous fuel (diesel 
combustion was still predominant) occurred with 20% R-EGR addition 
due to increased fuel consumption (i.e., a higher BSFC in g/kWh); while 
improving  gaseous  fuel  oxidation  with  30%  R-EGR  addition  lowered 
BSFC due to approaching the stoichiometric air-fuel mixture by reducing 
O2  concentration  in  the  cylinder  and  the  higher  intake  temperature. 
Note  that  all  these  engine  tests  were  achieved  with  simulated  R-EGR 
bottled gas replaced with a part (or entire) of EGR.

in the following. In general, optimized heat transfer from exhaust gas 
stream to catalyst with minimized heat loss positively affects hydrogen 
and CO yields, and this can be addressed with an appropriate reformer 
design and a fitting place of the reformer relative to the engine. How-
ever, before all of these, the engine operating conditions decide what 
will happen inside the reformer. 
Thermochemical recovery: 
The  engine  provides  heat  and  reactants  (oxidizer  or  steam)  for 
evaporating liquid fuel and initiating reactions involved in the reform-
ing process. The exhaust gas stream contains CO2  (for dry reforming), 
H2O (for steam reforming), and O2 (for partial or complete oxidation); 
each  of  them  can  initially  react  with  the  engine  fuel  with  a  proper 
catalyst.  Thereafter,  CO  supplied  by  incomplete  combustion  from  the 
engine or by the product of preceding primary reactions can react with 
steam not yet consumed to perform the water-gas shift (WGS) reforming 
reaction as a means of minimizing CO, which may be considered as a CO 
clean-up strategy for the catalyst [116,493], similar to that for avoiding 
poisoning of fuel cell anodes [494]. Finally, methanation reactions may 
take place to consume available hydrogen in reformate, decreasing the 
potential H2 yield. 

Understanding which of the reactions has a significant share in the 
reforming process depends on the temperature and composition of the 
engine  exhaust  gas,  which  directly  relies  on  the  engine  operating

Yap et al. [356] introduced a closed reforming loop system in the 
inlet of the exhaust manifold of a natural gas HCCI engine to perform 
◦
methane  (base  fuel)  reforming  at  low  temperatures  (~  300
C)  corre-
sponding  to  lean  operation.  Since  hydrogen  yield  varies  with  engine 
operating  load  (see  Fig.  53  (left)),  they  suggested  that  a  part  of  the 
exhaust  gas  can  be  displaced  by  extra  O2  content  from  the  incoming 
fresh air (see Fig. 53 (right)) to maintain the hydrogen production target 
of 10% (by vol.) from 1 to 3 bar IMEP. Recently, another study [511] 
also reported that the adverse effect of highly endothermic conditions 
(ϕcatalyst  >7)  on  the  suppression  of  high  reformate  yields  could  be 
counteracted  by  adding  a  small  quantity of  O2,  reaching  15%  H2  (by 
vol.). 

In  general,  if  the  steam  reforming  process  reduces  the  reformer 
temperature  sufficiently,  the  possibility  of  inactivating  the  entire 
reforming  process  must  be  considered.  Therefore,  the  addition  of  O2 
contained in the incoming fresh air as an option affords partial oxidation 
reforming to prevent inactivity of reforming process at low temperature 
and high reformer equivalence ratio (near to stoichiometric and higher 
engine loads) conditions. Interestingly, despite stressing on pure O2  to 
provide a large amount of H2 in fuel cells [512], just fresh air is sufficient 
due to the need for a small amount of H2 for IC engine applications. 

The  effects  of  water  added  into  the  exhaust  gas  fuel  reformer  on 
hydrogen  yield  and  conversion  efficiency  of  catalytically  diesel 
◦
reforming were also investigated by Tsolakis et al. [497]; at T=290
C 
reformer inlet temperature, H2 in the reformer product was obtained up 
to 15% more than with reformer operating without supplying water, due 
to presence of WGS reactions and then CO consumption in the reforming 
process. While heat losses from oxidative reactions can be mitigated by 
water  addition,  however,  endothermic  nature  of  WGS  can  lead  to  a 
reduction in overall engine-reactor efficiency. 
Full scale engine-reformer integration: 
A problem with aforementioned works was that the reformer and IC 
engine was not considered as a fully integrated system. As described in 
Fennel et al. [100,492], for the first time, a full-scale prototype gasoline 
reformer  consists  of  a  stack  of  five  metallic  catalyst  plates  loaded  by 
3.3% Pt/ 1.7% Rd was integrated with a modern TC, multi-cylinder GDI 
engine, by installing the reformer after TWC. A high pressure EGR loop 
was used to introduce a fraction of engine exhaust gas as the feed gas 
into the reformer and then the produced reformate was inducted into the 
intake  manifold  of  the  engine.  Initially,  they  showed  R-EGR  benefits 
over the baseline and conventional EGR in GDI engine, in terms of en-
gine efficiency, NOx and PM emissions, due to extension of the dilution 
limit [505,506]. Secondly, it was shown that temperature distribution 
and generally performance of the reformer have a great dependency on 
the  exhaust  temperature  and  mass  flow  rate  of  the  feed  gas.  At  high 
◦
temperature  conditions  (> 650
C),  both  efficiencies  of  engine  and 
reformer process were improved up to 8% and being more than 100%, 
respectively, indicating an improvement in the base fuel enthalpy. At 
◦
lower temperatures (~ 600
C), engine efficiency increased up to 4%; but 

in contrast, reformer efficiency was less than 100%, meaning some en-
ergy  is  lost  in  the  base  fuel  (gasoline)  during  the  reforming  process 
[507].  Finally,  they  offered  that  the  downsizing  strategy  and  using  a 
boost device with GDI engine would be favorable for exhaust gas fuel 
reforming  because  operating  IMEPs  of  engine  will  be  shifted  to  the 
higher loads, resulting in increasing the exhaust gas temperature. 

Ashida  et  al.  [485,513]  used  a  4  wt% Rh/Al2O3  catalyst  reformer 
installed in the external EGR line of a SI engine (see Fig. 50, under the 
label  of  ‘On-board  fuel  reformer’)  for  catalytic  steam  reforming  of 
injected gasoline in the presence of high-temperature EGR gas, without 
any additional O2. They initially observed an H2 production close to the 
calculated  equilibrium  concentration,  but  later  catalyst  deactivation 
almost started appearing within 5 hours, affecting the catalyst’s dura-
bility [514]. Thus, steam reforming only will potentially face the chal-
lenges of catalyst activity and durability in R-EGR strategy. Similarly, 
Brookshear  et  al.  [515]  at  Oak  Ridge  National  Laboratory  (ORNL) 
incorporated  a  2  wt%  Rh/Al2O3  catalyst  into  the  EGR  loop  of  a 
multi-cylinder,  stoichiometric  SI  engine.  That  work  was  followed  by 
Chang et al. [511] to characterize the catalytic reforming performance 
using  equilibrium  modeling  and  experiments  with  iso-octane  fueling. 
They firstly showed that reformer temperature, O2 mole concentration, 
H/C ratio of the fuel, and equivalence ratio of the catalyst are all key 
factors  for  determining  the  reformate  products.  Findings  at  a 
quasi-state-state condition revealed that the highest H2 yield (15% vol.) 
(Fig.  54-A)  for  O2  catalyst  flow  rate  of  12  g/min  (and  higher)  has 
coincided with maximum water consumption (Fig. 54-D) in the range 
of4  < φcatalyst  < 7,  suggesting  the  strong  presence  of  SR  or  WGS  re-
actions.  Moreover,  forφcatalyst  > 5,  CO  began  being  consumed 
(Fig. 54-B), and then H2/CO captured higher values, meaning that the 
WGS would predominate at lower catalyst temperatures (Fig. 54-C). 

Hwang  et  al.  [516]  were  the  first  researchers  who  introduced  a 
thermally  integrated  Rh/Pt  catalyst  reformer  with  a  diesel  engine  to 
mitigate heat losses to the environment by mounting the reformer inside 
the  exhaust  manifold  system.  In  this  way,  much  more  heat  is  readily 
accessible to the exhaust fuel reformer; thus, the primary candidate for 
catalytic reactions will be steam reforming. While the study showed the 
capability  of  producing  high  concentrations  of  hydrogen  (as  much  as 
10%  indicating  high  conversion  efficiency),  the  on-board  reforming 
system indicated a decrease in overall engine efficiency due to a fuel 
energy penalty for diesel at conditions with low reformer equivalence 
ratio  (φreformer~1.5).  Hence,  a  thermally  integrated  reforming  system 
with a high reformer equivalence ratio (lower dependency on POX re-
actions) demonstrated improvement in both engine and reformer con-
version  efficacies.  Completely  eliminating  POX  in  the  reformer  along 
with  using  water  contained  in  the  fuel,  like  hydrous  ethanol  as  the 
secondary fuel to provide a source of water for SR, is a solution to boost 
TCR effect; in this regard, the same authors [487] developed their pro-
posed  reformer  and  called  it  integrated  steam  reforming  (ISR)  (see 
Fig. 50, under the label of ‘Integrated steam reforming (ISR) reactor’) to 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience90(2022)10099546A. Paykani et al.

enable diesel engine dual-fuel (diesel/syngas) operation. It was shown 
that the heating value of the fuel increased by 23% at 100% conversion. 

Reforming fuel type: 
It has been reported that the reformer and catalyst designs should be 
optimized  exclusively  for  each  type  of  reforming  fuel  in  the  REGR- 
assisted  IC  engine  application.  For  instance,  Tsolakis  et  al.  [517] 
compared  the  reforming  of  ultra-low  sulfur  diesel  (ULSD)  with 
ultra-clean gas-to-liquid (GTL) fuels for a single-cylinder diesel engine. 
They  showed  decreased  methanation  reactions,  which  ends  with  CH4 
present  in  the  reformed  products  with  GTL  fueling.  Thus,  results  in 
higher  hydrogen  generation  and  fuel  conversion  compared  to  ULSD 
reforming.  These  advantages  of  such  fueling  can  result  in  reformer 
compactness improvement and catalyst cost-benefit. 

The feasibility of R-EGR with renewable fuels such as biodiesel was 
shown in the earlier stages of research in a CI engine [495], and later 
with renewable oxygenated fuels like bioethanol and rapeseed methyl 
ester (RME) in both CI and HCCI engines [356,503,504,518]. Tsolakis 
et al. [519] indicated that both of them have higher reforming efficiency 
(as defined by low heating values of products over the fuel input) and H2 

production compared to ULSD, especially at lower reformer inlet tem-
◦
peratures  (~290
C).  Thus,  reforming  process  efficiency  has  a  strong 
reliance  on  reforming  fuel  type.  For  CI  engines,  other  fuels  such  as 
biogas [501,520,521] are also used to upgrade into reformate through 
exhaust gas reforming. 

SI engine fueled with bioethanol was investigated for the first time by 
Leung et al. [484] for R-EGR; the activity of a precious-metal catalyst 
containing 1%Rh – 2%Pt (by mass) on 30% (by mass) ceria-zirconia for 
all expected reaction routes of bioethanol reforming during exhaust gas 
reforming  were  observed,  except  for  the  WGS  reaction.  Their  results 
predicted that the overall reforming process is oxidative, increasing fuel 
heating value by 6% while increasing it up to 20% with less O2 present in 
the  exhaust.  Researchers  at  AVL  and  Monsanto  Co.  [488,522,523] 
designed a compact lightweight, exhaust gas ethanol reformer, called 
"shoebox",  with  a  copper-nickel  powder  catalyst  to  combine  with  a 
multi-cylinder SI engine fueled with ethanol or E85 (see Fig. 50, under 
the label of ‘Shoebox reformer design’), with the objectives of reducing 
HC emissions during cold start and improving part-load dilution. They 
initially observed that mixing 50% of (simulated) reformate, known as 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience90(2022)10099547A. Paykani et al.

the  “low-temperature  ethanol  reformate”  due  to  low  temperatures 
requirement (300-350
C), with E85 enables diluted engine operation, 
leading  to  a  10-17%  and  20-25%  rise  in  brake  thermal  efficiency  as 
compared  to  stoichiometric  E85  and  gasoline  baselines,  respectively 
[522]; mixing 25-40% of real ethanol reformate in E85 increased the 
efficiency by 10-12.3% at part load and idle conditions, as well as HC 
emission  reduction  [523].  Ji  et  al.  [524]  placed  an  ethanol  steam 
reformer loaded with the copper catalyst inside a multi-cylinder SI en-
gine fueled gasoline. Note that deionized water and ethanol were the 
feedstock of SR, meaning that the engine exhaust was just the source of 
heat, not reactants. They reported around 4.5% improvement in indi-
cated thermal efficiency with 2.43% of reformate (by vol.) in the total 
intake  gas.  Also,  the  exploration  of  suitable  catalyst  formulation  for 
exhaust gas-driven ethanol steam reforming (ESR) of a single-cylinder SI 
engine  is  discussed  in  [525].  Unlike  the  TCR  goal,  catalytic  partial 
oxidation (CPOX) of ethanol over Pt, Pt-Palladium (Pd), and Pt-Rh cat-
alysts  at  typical  diesel  exhaust  temperatures  up  to  400
C  have  been 
experimentally carried out as a viable pathway of producing reformate 
for the automotive exhaust gas aftertreatment systems [526,527]. For 
instance, it has been reported that for the CPOX of ethanol over a Pt-Rh 
on  alumina  at  a  constant  reformer  inlet  temperature  of  300
C,  that 
oxygen/ethanol (O/E) molar ratio has a key role in the determination of 
ethanol conversion, reaction temperature, H2 generation, and selectivity 
towardH2, such that the maximum H2  would be produced at a higher 
O/E  ratio  than  that  predicted  by  equilibrium,  for  a  given  ethanol 
concentration.

Hydrous ethanol (HE) or wet ethanol has considerable saving energy 
rather  than  anhydrous  ethanol,  (as  typical  alcoholic  engine  fuel)  in 
terms of not only eliminating the water removal requirement, but use of 
water content for assisting steam reforming. It has been claimed that HE 
distillation and dehydration account for about 50% consumption of total 
base ethanol energy [484]; thus, HE has higher overall energy cycle than 
anhydrous ethanol. HE as standalone fuel for IC engines may result in 
poor  performance  due  to  incomplete  combustion  and  severe  charge 
cooling effect of water [528]. Li [529] indicated the feasibility of 150 
proof HE (i.e., 75% ethanol with 25% water volume content) as exhaust 
reformer  fuel  of  SI  engine  fueled  with  gasoline;  the  HE  conversion 
peaked  at  approximately  675  K  using  a  copper-based  catalyst.  Also, 
Hwang et al. [487] catalytically converted a 150 proof HE over a Pt-Rh 
catalyst into a secondary fuel (with a 23% increase in heating value) for 
a diesel engine coupled to an exhaust reformer. Nevertheless, ethanol 
production  is  confined  to  certain  regions  such  as  Brazil  and  North 
America. 

Methanol  has  been  the  primary  fuel  in  reforming  applications  for 
many years because it requires a slightly lower reforming temperature 
than ethanol due to having no C-C bonds. This makes it candidates for 
100% reforming such that its resultant reformate would be as standalone 
fuel for the IC engines [33]. In this regard, Tartakovsky et al. [530–535] 
conducted  a  series  of  studies  on  on-board  methanol  steam  reforming 
(MSR)  with  a  high-pressure TCR  system  and  then introducing  it  with 
direct injection into the IC engine. Results from a DISI engine fed with 
100%  methanol  SR  products  as  engine  fuel  showed  an  18-39% 
improvement  in  the  indicated  efficiency  and  a  reduction  of  73-94%, 
90-95%,  85-97%,  and  10-25%  in  NOx,  CO,  HC,  and  CO2  emissions, 
respectively compared to gasoline within a wide range of engine loads. 
Lia and Horng [536] employed the exhaust heat of a 4-cylinder SI engine 
to drive MSR reactions over a CuO–ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst at a controlled 
C;  a  maximal  methanol  conversion  of 
reforming  temperature  of  300
93% and the molar flow rate of produced H2 by about 1.34 mole/min for 
a  steam  to  carbon  (S/C)  ratio  of  1.2  were  reported.  More  recently, 
Nguyen  et  al.  [537]  numerically  examined  the  efficiency  of  a 
REGR-assisted  SI  engine  fueled  with  methanol  and  then  compared  it 
with  ethanol  counterpart,  considering  only  steam  and  dry  reforming 
reactions  for  both  fuels.  As  illustrated  in  Fig.  55,  steam  reforming  of 
ethanol  with  H2/CO  products  (EtOH-CO)  and  with  H2/CO2  products 
(EtOH-CO2) have  higher  engine-cycle  efficiency than methanol  steam

two lower cases indicate no EGR and no reforming usage, and the top of

As another renewable fuel, ammonia, an affordable hydrogen carrier 
[538], can be converted into reformate which  is free of COx. Earlier, 
ammonia in the form of urea was applied on catalytic after-treatment 
systems  of  heavy-duty  diesel  engines  to  reduce  NOx  [539].  Then,

[540], with a diesel engine that provided 100-400
C was investigated 
through the auto-thermal (i.e., NH3-ATR) process and using a ruthenium 
(Ru)-Al2O3 catalyst [541]. It was observed that the H2 production was in 
the range of 2.5-3.2 l/min with the O2/NH3  ratio from 0.03 to 0.175 
with a fixed NH3  feed flow of 3 l/min; and when the small amount of 
produced  reformate  was  added  to  the  intake  air  (representing  as  5% 
replacement of diesel fuel), a substantial reduction was obtained in CO, 
CO2,  and  THC  emissions.  In  a  more  recent  study  [542],  exhaust 
reforming of ammonia at higher exhaust temperatures of a GDI engine 
(450-550
C) over an Rh-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst was evaluated by two cases of 
direct catalytic conversion of ammonia (a portion of exhaust used) and 
ammonia  decomposition  (only  exhaust  heat  used)  to  produce  H2-N2 
products. They showed that 30 and 32% improvements were achieved in 
the case of extracting exhaust heat and using exhaust gas, respectively. 
In summary, ethanol and methanol as suitable reforming feedstocks 
can facilitate catalyst reforming at lower temperatures, mainly due to 
having a simpler structure than the complex long-chain hydrocarbons. 
Another advantage is that they are soluble in water and can be premixed 
to contain appropriate molar steam-to-carbon ratio for reforming. Pure 
steam reforming of alcohols can be accomplished using waste heat in a 
TCR  reactor  due  to  their  ability  to  be  reformed  at  engine  exhaust- 
relevant temperatures. The temperature needed for reforming HC fuels 
◦
is at least about 550
C while for methanol and ethanol is typically in the 
C. However, because of methanol’s toxicity, it is less 
range of 250-300
desirable than ethanol for reforming.

Conclusion: 
With  the  assumption  of  a  proper  catalyst  reformer  choice  and 

appropriate integration with the IC engine:  

• At  close  to  stoichiometric  conditions  and  high  engine  loads:  more 
provided  heat  and  steam  to  drive  predominantly  endothermic  re-
actions (steam and dry reforming) increase the heating value of the 
base fuel and afford a high TCR effect. In the case of low tempera-

tures (<700
C), fresh air addition is an option to maintain catalyst 
activity by providing more heat from POX or combustion reactions

within the reformer. The overall process can be either exothermic or 
endothermic;  depending  upon  catalyst  temperature  and  reforming 
fuel type. 

• At lean conditions and low engine loads: higher oxygen concentra-
tions in the engine exhaust stream are accessible to the reformer but 
at  lower  temperatures.  A  high  achievable  conversion  efficiency, 
which yields high reformate concentrations in the range of 10-15% 
for both H2  and CO, can be demonstrated. In this case, the risk of 
combustion occurrence exists due to the possibility of complete fuel 
oxidation.  POX  reactions  may  increase  the  reformer  temperature 
exceedingly until the catalyst burns out or deactivation takes place.  
• Moreover, in an engine operating map, transients from low to high 
loads impose controllability issues due to variations in local reformer 
equivalence  ratio  (O2  availability).  Hence,  there  is  a  continuous 
balance to manage between high fuel enthalpy achievement and high 
reformate production (high fuel conversion) across all engine speed/ 
load conditions. 

According  to  the  literature,  stoichiometric  exhaust  at  higher  tem-
peratures (i.e., modern SI engines) is the priority to fully take advantage 
of  exhaust  gas  reforming  in  terms  of  heat  recovery  benefits;  and  for 
overall lower exhaust temperature, and proven feasibility of renewable 
oxygenated fuels such as methanol and ethanol with R-EGR suggest the 
need for more research in this area, despite having more cost relative to 
in-cylinder reforming strategies. 

4.2. In-cylinder fuel reforming 

4.2.1. Negative valve overlap (NVO) reforming 

Negative valve overlap fuel injection or NVO fuel injection (initially 
referred to as activation injection) was suggested [543] as a chemical 
extender  for  homogenous  combustion  by  injecting  fuel  into  the 
remaining exhaust gas (called residuals, iEGR or residual gas fraction) 
between two timings of early exhaust valve closing and late intake valve 
opening. This technique offers control of the activation energy of the 
main  combustion  reactions  by  potentially  providing  an  in-cylinder 
environment prone to ignite, as shown in Fig 56. 

On the other hand, the absence of any direct control of in-cylinder 
fuel  processing  in  a  typical  HCCI  engine  will  lead  to  a  narrower  en-
gine operating range due to the possibility of misfiring at low-load and 
severe  high-pressure  rise  rates  at  high  load.  Urushihara  et  al.  [545] 
recognized the concept of shifting the chemical composition of the fuel 
in the high-temperature residual gases and then recompressing during 
the exhaust stroke, and called it the fuel reforming process. They tested 
various  patterns  of  direct  fuel  injection  to  explore  the  effect  on 
expanding the operating range of a gasoline-fueled HCCI engine at low 
load. They represented an optimal direct fuel injection strategy in which 
a small amount of the fuel is injected during the NVO exhaust stroke 
while the rest is injected during the intake stroke, representing a split 
injection ratio. HCCI with NVO fuel reforming has been drawing a great 
deal  of  attention  for  several  years  [546–548].  The  usefulness  of  this 
technique was also investigated in other low temperature combustion

and LTGC combustion, including valve events [544]. 

(LTC) modes, such as in partially premixed combustion (PPC) [549]. 

In the case of the SI engine, low-temperature combustion modes such 
as HCCI and spark assisted compression ignition (SACI) have been used 
to  switch  the  stoichiometric  mode  of  a  traditional  SI  engine  to  an 
effective dilution mode, presenting a higher fuel economy than before; 
however,  they  encounter  a  narrower  load  range  for  the  HCCI  engine 
along  with  TWC  deficiency.  As  a  solution,  employing  NVO  fuel 
reforming  in  stoichiometric  SI  engines  has  recently  drawn  attention, 
resulting in extending the dilution limit at low and maybe part engine 
loads. For instance, Chang et al. [550] explored the effects of sweeping 
the  start  of  injection  (SOI)  timing,  from  300  to  420  CAD  BTDCfiring, 
during  a  fixed  NVO  period  of  80  CAD  and  varying  the  NVO  periods 
dilution  limit  in  a  stoichiometric  SI  engine  fueled  with  E10  (baseline 
engine fuel) at BMEP=3 bar and engine speed of1800 rpm. At a fixed 
NVO period of 80 CAD, while the maximum peak heat release rate with 
lowest CoV of IMEP belonged to the SOI=380 CAD BTDCfiring case, the 
volumetric efficiency remained unaffected by the swept NVO SOI, which 
means that no variation was seen in BMEP. Also, an extended dilution 
limit was seen with a total EGR rate of 32%, and a 22% reduction in 
BSFC as compared to the reference engine version, in the case of TDC 
injection (SOI=360 CADBTDCfiring) and 80 CAD NVO. 

A comparison between symmetric NVO and PVO strategies has been 
conducted  by  Rodriguez  and  Cheng  [551],  which  resulted  in  NVO 
benefits  at  low  load  by  7%  improvement  in  fuel  consumption  due  to 
reduced pumping losses. At part load, IMEP can increase up to 6 bar by 
combining  symmetric  NVO  with  optimized  EVO  timing  to  minimize 
losses of the blowdown process; which means that the PVO strategy is 
superior to the NVO strategy at part-load of a SI engine. More recently, 
the possibility of using NVO fuel reforming in a gasoline/diesel dual fuel 
engine [552] and RCCI engine fueled with natural gas(NG)/diesel has 
been  proposed  and  evaluated  through  the  simulation  based  on  a 
developed  in-house  code  [553].  The  low-load  efficiency  of  NG/diesel 
RCCI  with  NVO  reforming  was  better  than  a  lean  strategy  and  EGR 
baselines by 5.5% and 3%, respectively, due to increased combustion 
efficiency and despite NVO’s increased pumping losses. 

NVO fuel reforming effects: 
Thermal  and  chemical  effects  corresponding  to  the  NVO  fuel 
reforming process directly influence the main combustion; hence, these 
effects  must  be  identified  individually.  Retained  and  recompressed 
exhaust  enthalpy during the NVO period can raise the  overall charge 
temperature and this increases the specific heat ratio (γ) of the charge. 
Moreover, NVO fuel injection, and the corresponding reactions and heat 
release, produce reformate, which itself has a high specific heat ratio 
(~1.40), which further enhances the overall γ of the charge prior to the 
subsequent main-combustion event. As an outcome, increased thermal 
efficiency can be expected. On the other hand, NVO-reformate products 
can reduce the mixture’s overall ignition delay and expedite the mix-
ture’s chemical kinetics (i.e., a mixture with higher reactivity than the 
base fuel), which leads to improved stabilization of the main combustion 
and low-load limit of the engine. Here, temperature and available oxy-
gen in the residuals during NVO link both effects together. 

Song et al. [554] noticed that there is a competing effect between 
thermal and chemical effects by performing simulations on a gasoline 
HCCI engine operating at various equivalence ratios from 0.6 to 1 with 
NVO  pilot  injection,  which  resulted  in  optimum  oxygen  availability 
(equivalence  ratio)  for  successfully  reducing  ignition  delay.  At  lean 
conditions (high oxygen concentration) and near-stoichiometric (low--
oxygen concentration), exothermic reactions and endothermic reactions 
(from fuel pyrolysis) will become dominant, respectively. Szybist et al. 
[555]  pointed  out  that  a  large  amount  of  reformate  and  other 
short-chain hydrocarbons could be obtained in the low-O2 environment. 
Reported oxygen concentrations from documents are in a range of 2–4 % 
during the NVO period. 

Due to the complexity of measuring in-cylinder temperature, espe-
cially at the IVC of an engine cycle with NVO fuel reforming, several 
thermodynamic-based  predictor models  have  been  developed, relying 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience90(2022)10099549A. Paykani et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                

on temperature measurements at the exhaust port during the exhaust 
event  (blowdown  and  recompressing).  For  instance,  Fitzgerald  et  al. 
[556] developed an algorithm to isolate the thermal effect of NVO fuel 
reforming  on  iso-octane  HCCI  combustion  from  the  chemical  effect 
through calculating cycle temperature. In a later work they found [557] 
that chemical effects are dominant in late NVO fueling, because the early 
exothermic reactions due to the presence of ethylene and formaldehyde 
(reformed NVO species) offsets the cooler charge at IVC (thermal effect), 
and the main combustion remains advanced similar to the early fueling 
case. But, thermal effects have prominent role in early NVO fueling, with 
higher fuel conversion efficiency (~ 80-90%) as compared with the late 
fueling case. As an overall conclusion, NVO heat release depends on the 
mass and injection timings of the NVO fuel and oxygen availability. 

For better understanding of fuel reforming chemistry, kinetics, and 
the evolving reactive species, various sampling approaches in conjunc-
tion  with  gas  analyzers  have  been  implemented  experimentally  to 
characterize  the  NVO-period  reformate  [558,559].  In  this  regard,  re-
searchers at the Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), Oak Ridge National 
Laboratories  (ORNL),  and  the  University  of  Minnesota  had  valuable 
relevant contributions [544,560-568]. Through these studies the effect 
of  molecular  structure  of  the  NVO-fuel  [565]  on  NVO  fuel  reforming 
were explored for various fuels. The related ensemble-averaged in-cy-
linder pressure and heat release rate profiles during the NVO period are 
shown  in  Fig.  57.  For  ethanol  fueling,  the  exothermic  heat  release 
resulted  in  the  highest  peak  bulk-averaged  in-cylinder  temperature 
among  the  fuels.  As  shown,  for  most  fuels  the  lack  of  sufficient  heat 
release reveals that the fuel-injected was mainly converted into refor-
mate. Later modeling work by the same authors [567] used a detailed 
kinetic mechanism for iso-octane in a stochastic reactor model (SRM) 
that examined the NVO reforming process. This work found that endo-
thermic and exothermic reactions are mainly balanced for most fuels, 
limiting obvious heat release as found using in-cylinder pressure anal-
ysis.  The  modeling  work  also  suggested  that  the  in-cylinder  mixture 
gradient during NVO reforming was responsible for producing reactive 
species,  in  addition  to  the  main  syngas  components,  such  as  allene, 
acetaldehyde,  and  acetylene,  which  were  partially  responsible  for 
improved reactivity in the main low-temperature gasoline combustion 
(LTGC) ignition event. The significance of the NVO-fuel type also was 
reported  by  another  work  [560],  in  which  hydrogen  fraction  of 
NVO-reformate was less than 1.5% with iso-octane and more than 8% 
with methanol fueling. 

Moreover,  pathways  to  get  more  fuel  decomposition  (more  reac-
tivity) during NVO [566], and the impacts of NVO-reformate on engine

the  NVO  period  for  various  fuels  (Reprinted  from  [544]  with  permission 
of Elsevier). 

performance [544] have been discussed. For instance, it was reported 
that  more  fuel  decomposition  was  achievable  with  longer  chemistry 
residence times and lower spray impingement on piston surface (i.e., an 
advanced NVO SOI). 

As an energy recovery method: 
NVO fuel reforming can be regarded as a thermochemical recuper-
ation process in which waste exhaust thermal energy converts to more 
accessible chemical energy for the main combustion; the injected fuel 
during  the  NVO  period  uses  the  heating  provided  from  trapped  and 
recompressed  exhaust  residuals  left  from  the  previous  cycle  to  drive 
endothermic reactions, resulting in the reformate having higher overall 
energy  content.  However,  heat  transfer  and  pumping  losses  are  two 
main source of losses which come from the trapped and recompressed 
NVO-gasses,  and  mixing  of  the  NVO-period  charge  with  the  cooler 
intake charge, respectively. Adjusting a combination of fueling rate, fuel 
injection  timing,  and  available  oxygen  concentration  during  NVO 
period, such that the recovered energy compensates for the losses, and 
the  reformate  species  maximize  at  that  combination  is  an  important 
topic. Ekoto et al. [563] modeled a single-cylinder, LTGC engine with a 
NVO  fuel  reforming  technique  as  a  closed  system  (from  EVC  to  IVC) 
undergoing  thermodynamic  processes  to  perform  energy  analysis  for 
two  fuels  of  ethanol  and  iso-octane.  In  comparison  with  iso-octane 
fueling,  ethanol  produced  higher  NVO-apparent  heat  release  (AHR) 
despite its higher evaporative cooling effect, but with lower recovered 
energy due to its fast ignition chemistry. Among the findings, it has been 
reported that approximately 70% of usable energy recovery, which was 
defined as the sum of AHR and recovered fuel energy, is achievable in 
NVO in-cylinder fuel reforming for gasoline-like fuels with low (or zero) 
toluene content. As a result, a higher NVO global equivalence ratio by 
either  reducing  the  NVO-period  oxygen  concentration  or  increasing 
fueling rates leads to a larger fraction of recovered fuel energy. Addi-
tionally, large NVO fuel injection and NVO-SOI advancement resulted in 
the  highest  overall-cycle  thermodynamic  efficiencies,  all  of  which 
depended  on  NVO-fuel  type  (fuel  chosen  for  the  NVO  reforming 
process). 

Conclusions: 
To sum up, NVO fuel reforming is a direct-injection fuel method that 
assists the NVO technique (a valving strategy) to address problems of 
undesirable combustion in the SI engine and misfiring at low load in the 
HCCI engine fueled with low reactivity fuels by changing the chemical 
and thermal effects, and consequently, the reactivity of the in-cylinder 
combustible  mixture  by  reforming  the  base  fuel.  Application  of  NVO 
fuel reforming to control combustion phasing and as an extender of the 
low-load HCCI/LTGC and stoichiometric SI engines by providing more 
stabilized  combustion  has  been  successfully  proved.  However,  the 
resultant  NVO-reformate  has  shown  great  sensitivity  not  only  to  in- 
cylinder  conditions,  but  also  heavily  to  the  NVO-injection  strategy, 
which is varied by the selected fuel. Therefore, this sensitivity leads to 
complex  interactions  that  must  be  considered  to  result  in  an  overall 
optimum charge to favor the main combustion. Demonstrating this on- 
board  fuel  reforming  technique  with  a  combustion  mode  like  RCCI, 
developing  suitable  kinetic  mechanisms,  and  achieving  the  best  fuel 
energy  recovery  in  terms  of  appropriate  in-cylinder  thermal  manage-
ment might be attractive research topics for the future. 

4.2.2. Dedicated exhaust gas recirculation (D-EGR) 

Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) is well-known as an effective tech-
nique of SI engine efficiency improver and NOx reducer; however, there 
are some severe impediments for EGR, including limited dilution and 
combustion  instability  at  a  higher  EGR  rate  (10-20%).  Developing 
concepts aiming at higher engine efficiency led to the idea of combining 
the  EGR  with  the  fuel  reformation  through  dedicated  cylinder(s)  to 
perform  in-cylinder  partial  oxidation  reactions  associated  with  rich 
combustion. 

The idea of using one or some of the cylinders of a multi-cylinder 
engine as a fuel reformer (or a reactor) to perform the fuel reforming 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience90(2022)10099550A. Paykani et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                

process  was  first  introduced  by  Meyers  and  Kubesh  [569]  at  the 
Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), where they studied a lean natural 
gas-fueled SI engine with an assigned rich-burn cylinder to produce the 
EGR, primarily consisting of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The work 
resulted in an efficient lean-burn SI engine with more combustion sta-
bility  and  thermal  efficiency,  called  the  “hybrid  rich-burn/lean-burn 
engine.”  The idea was then further developed into forming an engine 
technology termed dedicated exhaust gas recirculation or D-EGR [570] 
from the sequential works at SwRI. In this technology, while the dedi-
cated cylinder(s) runs beyond stoichiometric (i.e., rich combustion), the 
rest of the cylinders can operate at nearly stoichiometric conditions to 
properly comply with the three-way catalyst after-treatment system in SI 
engines. The dedicated cylinder’s exhaust stream, containing not only 
the inert species (i.e., typical EGR products) but also the reactive con-
stituents (i.e., reformate), is entirely separated from the exhaust mani-
fold and redirected to the intake manifold to serve as the only EGR for 
the entire engine, as demonstrated in Fig. 58. The D-EGR concept from 
various aspects to its demonstration in modern engine technology will 
be discussed in the following. 
D-EGR / TFR concept: 
In the first practical attempt, Alger and Mangold [572] reconfigured 
a 2.4 L gasoline engine to dedicate one of its four cylinders for only EGR 
production of the entire engine by a fixed rate of 25% (by vol.). Prior to 
metal  engine  experiments, they calculated the  concentration of  refor-
mate relative to the air-to-fuel (A/F) ratio variations from stoichiometric 
to  rich,  by  measuring  the  gasses  in  the  D-EGR  cylinder  exhaust  (see 
Fig. 59). Then, they investigated the effects of the D-EGR products on the 
engine  performance  for  the  various  engine  speed/load  combinations. 
The results obtained showed substantial improvements in thermal effi-
ciency and emissions at both high and, in particular, low loads when the 
D-EGR  cylinder  steadily  undergoes  rich  combustion  up  to  about  an 
equivalence ratio of 1.2 (φD  (cid:0) EGRcylinder = 1.2) and the other cylinders 
run at fixed stoichiometric conditions(φothercylinders = 1). Fig. 60 shows 
the low-load results in which fuel consumption, stability in terms of CoV 
IMEP, and emissions have been improved over the baseline case. Also, it 
was  observed  that  the  total  burn  duration  decreased  significantly  by 
reducing the early stages of kernel formation near the spark plug (i.e., 
0-2% MFB duration), resulting in increased in-cylinder temperature and 
elevated NOx emissions, but still lower than the baseline. 

Later, Zhu et al. [573] from Shanghai Jiao Tong University employed 
the  analogous  concept  to  D-EGR,  named  the  thermochemical  fuel

levels of enrichment by performing a chemical balance in the D-EGR cylinder 
exhaust [570]. 

reforming (TFR) concept (see Fig. 61 right). Initially, they applied it to a 
turbocharged, 4-cylinder SI engine specifically designed for natural gas 
fueling with stoichiometric operation to exhibit the potential benefits of 
the  TFR  concept  over  conventional  EGR.  Moreover,  they  defined  the 
term in-cylinder TFR to evaluate the in-cylinder thermochemical pro-
cess, in which a higher in-cylinder TFR would result in a greater amount 
of H2 and CO and lower unreformed CH4 fraction in the exhaust gas of 
the TFR cylinder (the cylinder dedicated to the TFR process). At a fixed 
◦
speed of 1500 rpm and the same ignition timing of 20
BTDC applied to 
all cylinders, they performed a line of experimental works coupled with 
laminar flame calculations using CHEMKIN to evaluate in-cylinder TFR

and engine uniformity by sweeping the equivalence ratio (ϕ) of the TFR 
cylinder from 1 to 1.4. At ϕ=1.2, where the maximum CO and H2 con-
centrations  were  achieved,  an  upper  limit  for  stability  of  the 
rich-combustion with natural gas fueling in the TFR cylinder was found 
over  a  range  of  low-to-high  loads.  Therefore,  φTFR  = 1  indicated  a 
constant EGR rate of 25%, and φTFR = 1.2 is representative of the same 
rate but containing reformate gas. Early results indicated that the CoV of 
IMEP improved by about 65% for low engine loads and engine perfor-
mance and emissions except that NOx was elevated over the entire load 
range tested in the case of φTFR  = 1.2 compared to φTFR  = 1 (conven-
tional EGR). 

New term definition: 
From the literature reviewed here cylinder(s) dedicated to run under 
on-board fuel reforming conditions and rich combustion can be marked 
as the D-EGR/TFR or rich cylinder(s) and the rest referred to as normal 
or stoichiometric cylinders. Additional fuel required for performing fuel- 
rich combustion in the D-EGR cylinder(s) can also be referred to by the 
over-fueling  or  reformation  ratio,  e.g.,  30%  over-fueling/reformation 

ratio that means φDEGR=1.3. The produced reformate is also called D- 
EGR/TFR  gas.  Some  new  terms  have  also  been  extracted  from  the 
comparison between traditional EGR (inert gases) and D-EGR (EGR +
reformate) that are explained in the following. 

In this concept, when routing the reformate-enriched EGR (or EGR in 
D-EGR engine) back to the intake manifold, it is vital to characterize the 
intake concentrations, since highly reactive species like H2 in the intake 
charge could promote backfiring, which can damage the intake system. 
Moreover, the contributions of isolated reactive species and inert gases 
from D-EGR in the intake charge are not well-known, and eventually, 
affect the main combustion. Thus, a new parameter of total inert dilution 
ratio (TIDR) was empirically defined by Alger et al. [574] as a common 
basis for comparison EGR and D-EGR. The definition is: 

TIDR =

XN2 in + XCO2 in + XH2O in
XN2 in + XCO2 in + XH2O in + XO2 in

(7)

ventional  EGR  rate  (calculated  by  the  ratio  of  CO2  at  the  intake  and 
exhaust manifold) has been shown when the air-fuel mixture’s equiva-
lence  ratio  in  the  D-EGR  cylinder  was  swept  from  1  to  about  1.5. 
Therefore, this term shows the discrepancy between conventional EGR 
(i.e., stoichiometric EGR with 100% diluents) and D-EGR (i.e., rich EGR 
with  a  mixture  of  diluents  and  reactive  species).  Nevertheless,  since 
TIDR has a slight variation range (0% and 30% EGR rate = 0.77 and 0.83 
of  TIDR,  respectively)  and  the  largest  constituent  of  diluents  is  N2,  a 
substitute term named EGR* [575] also is defined to show sufficiently 
the  differences  between  the  nominal  rate  of  conventional  EGR  (e.g., 
low-pressure loop EGR) and D-EGR, as shown in Fig. 62, and:

Comparison with conventional EGR: 
The D-EGR concept was introduced to overcome conventional EGR 
shortcomings,  such  as  combustion  instability  and  misfiring  at  a  high 
rate, and inappropriate flow control. Therefore, in most earlier studies, 
the D-EGR concept was compared to conventional EGR. 

In a direct comparison study, Gukelberger et al. [576,577] compared 
D-EGR with low-pressure loop (LPL) cooled EGR at part- and high-load 
operation in a turbocharged, 2L PFI SI engine. They found that at low 
engine load, combustion stability of φD (cid:0) EGR= 1.45 is comparable with 
almost  13-14%  LPL  cooled  EGR.  Both  HC  and  CO  emissions  were 
reduced; however, NOx emissions were increased slightly with D-EGR 
operation. Generally, at low loads, the findings indicated that the D-EGR 
engine  could  withstand  higher  levels  of  EGR  dilution,  allow  faster 
burning speeds, and afford a further improvement in efficiency, and at 
high loads, provides superior knock tolerance and stability over the LPL

EGR  system.  It  is  noteworthy  that  the  D-EGR  engine  was  allowed  to 
operate with higher compression ratios (12.5:1 and 13.5:1 at high load) 
than the baseline case (9:1). The engine operation map for 25% LPL EGR 
is demonstrated in Fig. 63. It can be seen that only 25% EGR has com-
parable performance with D-EGR (with the same nominal EGR rate, i.e., 
25%) in the green region. The yellow region could be covered with EGR 
but at a lower rate of 25% and approximately a 5% increase in BSFC. The 
region  colored  red  could  be  covered  with  D-EGR  and  an  adequate 
boosting system, but cannot be accessed with the LPL EGR setup due to 
knocking propensity. 

Overall, the D-EGR concept is a revision of conventional EGR (cooled 
EGR)  concepts,  and  has  advantages  over  those,  including  eliminating 
any  uncertainty  in  EGR  production  and  the  need  for  the  EGR  valve, 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience90(2022)10099553A. Paykani et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                

providing  an  easy  way  for  transient  control,  and  increasing  the  EGR 
quality by the reformate from in-cylinder fuel reforming. Interestingly, 
the  potential  of  more  than  25%  nominal  EGR  has  numerically  been 
explored for a V6 engine modified to run at 50% D-EGR using three of 
the six cylinders in D-EGR mode [578,579]. 

Fuel type effects: 
The main research related to D-EGR have been carried out on gaso-
line  or  natural  gas  fueled  SI  engines.  Gasoline  with  various  research 
octane number (RON) or anti-knock indices (RON+MON/2) and with 
different  ethanol  blended  (E0:100%  gasoline  [by  vol.]  and  E47:  47% 
ethanol  [by  vol.])  [580,581],  and  natural  gas  [573]  blended  with 
alcohol fuels like ethanol [582], methanol [583–585], propanol isomers 
[585,586], n-heptane [587,588], iso-octane [588] and propane [589] 
fuels have been studied so far. 

Gasoline fuels with various anti-knock indices (AKI) were selected to 
examine  the  relationship  between  the  reformation  rate  (over-fueling) 
and  octane  fuel  number  [580].  It  was  shown  that  a  1.8  AKI  increase 
corresponds  to  a  10%  increase  in  the  reformation  rate.  As  shown  in 
Fig. 64, higher octane fuel would be the same as lower octane fuel at a 
reformation  ratio  of  30%.  Additionally,  more  than  30%  over-fueling 
could  worsen  the  IMEP  balance  between  the  dedicated  cylinder  and 
normal cylinders, resulting in degenerating engine uniformity. Also, it 
was shown that higher ethanol content in gasoline fuel (e.g., E-47) leads 
to  an  apparent  increase  in  hydrogen  production  through  the  D-EGR 
in-cylinder  fuel  reforming  having  a  higher  H/C  ratio,  but  the  brake 
thermal  efficiency  is  virtually  independent  of  that  [581]  (see  Fig.  64 
right). 

○ 

A  small  amount  of  alcohol  as  an  enriching  fuel  can  improve  fuel 
reforming due to higher radical production to ease the partial oxidation 
reactions participating in the in-cylinder fuel reforming process. He et al. 
[582] experimentally compared natural gas and ethanol enrichment at 
φTFR=1.25 and  a  fixed spark timing of 20
BTDC for a  natural gas SI 
engine. Their results indicated more stable engine operation (i.e., lower 
cyclic  variability,  see  Fig.  65  (c)),  higher  engine  uniformity  (i.e.,  less 
IMEP  disparity  between  the  TFR  cylinder  and  a  normal  cylinder,  as 
shown by cylinder2, see Fig. 65 (d)), higher rates of produced H2 and CO 
concentrations and also lower unburnt CH4 fraction in the reformate (i. 
e.,  complete in-cylinder TRF, see  Fig. 65 (a)),  and significantly lower 
NOx with the case of ethanol enrichment. More reactive species are due 
to presence of hydroxyl in the structure of ethanol that might potentially 
lead  to  higher  O,  H,  OH  radicals  (see  Fig.  65  (a))  and  improved  fuel 
oxidation. 

Zhu  et  al.  [585]  numerically  and  experimentally  showed  that 
methanol enrichment has a great contribution to methane oxidation as 

compared with ethanol, propanol, ethylene glycol, aiding to the higher 
formation of H2 and CO, due to the presence of OH. Thus, methanol is 
the optimal enrichment fuel for the TFR-cylinder operating on natural 
gas. 

Reformate analysis: 
D-EGR reformate gas provided by running fuel-rich combustion de-
pends on how the  fuel-air mixture’s rich limit behaves under engine- 
relevant  conditions,  which  itself  depends  upon  the  fuel  type  used. 
Alger et al. [590] reported that only 0.2% and about 0.4% hydrogen by 
volume is needed in the intake stream of a SI engine fueled with gasoline 
and natural gas, respectively, to enhance engine stability significantly. 
For  instance,  Fig.  59  and  Fig.  65(b)  represent  the  reactive  species 
generated in the D-EGR and TRF concepts, respectively, based on the 
fuel used. 

Liu et al. [591] ran a single-cylinder, natural gas SI engine, retro-
fitted from a diesel engine, in a fuel-rich combustion mode (as a D-EGR 
cylinder) to characterize the generated reformate quantitatively by gas 
chromatography. They found that both H2 and CO mole fractions were 
increased linearly from ϕ=1 to ϕ=1.4 by about 8% with a nearly con-
stant H2/CO ratio (1:1 by vol.). They also employed rapid compression 
machine (RCM) experiments [592] for the CH4 ignition at similar con-
ditions. They also examined the effect of 1% (φD (cid:0) EGR= 1.2) and 2% (φD 
(cid:0) EGR= 1.4) H2/CO ratio (by vol.) on stoichiometric natural gas com-
bustion at a part load condition of ~ 6 bar IMEP at two nominal EGR 
rates of 15% and 20%. 

From the literature, φD  (cid:0) EGR  between 1.2-1.4 is a decent range in 
terms of stability while φD (cid:0) EGR>1.4 imposes a rich limit for fuels used. 
The possibility of φD (cid:0) EGR up to 3 and its effects on reformate generation 
were  investigated  numerically  [579].  Although  D-EGR  is  indeed  a 
non-catalyst fuel reforming technique, catalyst formulation such as the 
WGS catalyst with Rhodium and Barium was employed in the exhaust 
stream of the D-EGR cylinder to further boost H2  generation [593]; it 
was shown that H2  generation reaches 7% (by volume) through opti-
mizing the catalyst formulation, though an activity loss was seen after 
about 12 hours. This imposes durability challenges. 

Demonstration of D-EGR vehicle: 
As mentioned before, the constraints of a downsized boosted SI en-
gine operating stoichiometric with traditional (cooled or uncooled) EGR 
pertain to knock limitations, EGR tolerance, and combustion instability, 
which can be improved using reformate along with EGR. Therefore, the 
D-EGR  concept  provides  the  pathways  of  achieving  high-efficiency  SI 
engines.  To  better  demonstrate  an  actual  D-EGR  vehicle,  several  in-
struments,  including  an  advanced  high-energy  dual  coil  offset  (DCO) 
ignition system [594] for facilitating ignition of dilute mixtures and a

D-EGR  mixer  [595]  for  promoting  reformate  distribution  to  suppress 
sudden imbalances in CoV of IMEP of the normal cylinders, have been 
developed together with applying improvements in order to increase the 
reformate  yield  such  as  improved  injection  strategies  (more  effective 
with split and late DI than PFI, except at low speed) [596], valve timing 
(more  sensitive  to  retardation  of  exhaust  valve  compared  to  advance 
intake valve) [596] and ignition timing based on transient control [597, 
598]. 

Chadwell et al. [571] first successfully replaced a 2.4 L, NA PFI SI 
engine (LEA, engine produced by GM) with a converted D-EGR, 2 L, TC 
DISI  engine  (LHU,  engine  produced by  GM)  fueling  with  Haltermann 
EEE certification gasoline with an anti-knock index of 92 on a produc-
tion  vehicle  (2012  Buick  Regal)  with  a  designed  air  handling  system 
consisting of EGR control, boosting and D-EGR mixing systems, as seen 
in Fig. 66 (left), and with an increased compression ratio of OEM LHU 
from 9.3:1 to 11.7:1. The target operating points of torque and power for 
vehicle-based D-EGR with a nominal EGR ratio of 25% were designed 
beyond the reference vehicle with GM LEA (see Fig. 66 (right)). It was 
observed that BSFC is reduced by an average of 10% across most oper-
ating  points  relative  to  the  reference  engine.  The  most  considerable 
reduction  occurred  at  high  speeds  and  high  engine  loads  due  to 
completely removing the over-fueling in the D-EGR cylinder. This fuel 
economy improvement was attributed primarily to increased compres-
sion ratio due to enhanced knock tolerance resulting from the reformate 
existing in the charge and stoichiometric operation. Also, it was reported 
that the sufficient hydrogen concentration to stabilize the combustion at 
low loads was about just 1% by volume. Robertson et al. [599] tested the 
performance of the same converted D-EGR vehicle on the FTP-75 (for the 
city) and HWFET (for the highway); compared to the baseline vehicle, 
they observed that the fuel consumption was reduced by 13% and 9%, 
NOx was reduced by 85%, non-methane organic gases (NMOG) emis-
sions remained constant and were reduced by 33%, respectively, for the 
FTP-75 and HWFET. 

Also, potential demonstration of D-EGR system in a moderately large 
displacement (~ 3-4 L) gasoline engine as substitution of a medium-duty 
diesel  truck  (~  6-7  L)  was  shown  using  GT-Power  simulations,  and 
comparable thermal efficiency and GHC emissions results were noticed 
[600]. 

The core aim of the concept is to improve the stoichiometric SI en-
gine’s  efficiency  through  extension  of  its  dilution-limit  without  sacri-
ficing TWC’s efficiency or increasing the tailpipe-out emissions of the 
vehicle by using reformate (syngas)-enriched EGR. Jung and Lee [601] 
determined computationally the D-EGR potential with a lean SI engine 
fueled  with  methane.  They  founded  the  highest  engine  thermal  effi-
ciency (ηth e) of 42.9% resulted from a combination of φD (cid:0) EGR = 2 with 
φNormal = 0.7 operation, compared to the maximum ηth e of 39.4% for φD 
(cid:0) EGR = 1.9 and φNormal = 1. Recently, use of an air-assisted pre-chamber 
in a natural gas fueled six-cylinder D-EGR engine has also been shown to 
be highly effective in stabilizing the combustion and extending enrich-
ment limits by 11.7% [602]. The leaner mixture permits ignition of the 
mixture and stabilizes combustion. Therefore, the conventional benefits 
of the pre-chamber can be utilized for D-EGR applications. Osaka Gas 
Co.  [603]  has  also  considered  applying  a  D-EGR  system  to  a  turbo-
charged lean HCCI engine as a long-term pathway for a high-efficiency 
small gas engine in power generation applications. 

Conclusion: 
To sum up, in-cylinder on-board fuel reforming with the D-EGR/TFR 
concept  has  been  realized  in  various  production  vehicle  SI  engines 
operating stoichiometric without requiring any external reforming de-
vice, while avoiding catalyst-related issues (poisoning and aging) and 
vast  internal  engine  modifications  (excluding  potential  compression 
ratio  increase due to enhanced knock resistance). However, some de-
vices  are  required  to  convert  a  SI  engine  to  an  effective  D-EGR  one, 
including  a  mixer,  boosting  device,  charge  air  cooler,  and  suitable 
ignition system as well as an over-fueling requirement along with sup-
plying  injector(s)  and  delivering  the  D-EGR  loop  for  the  dedicated 

cylinder.  Profound  consequences  include  increased  engine  efficiency 
with  reduced  emissions  and  increased  EGR  quality  due  to  reformate 
presence  with  reduced/eliminated  downside  effects  of  conventional 
EGR, namely, uncertainty in EGR production and difficulty in transient 
control and the need for high EGR levels (>15%). Isolated combustion 
stability of the dedicated cylinder(s) and the balanced IMEP between D- 
EGR  (rich)  cylinder(s)  and  normal  (stoichiometric)  cylinders  (engine 
uniformity) represent a new trade-off that must also be considered as 
well as fresh concerns related to fuel selection. D-EGR fueling optimi-
zation based on fuel type is of significant importance and has not been 
well addressed until now. Besides, D-EGR experiments with lean SI en-
gines might be an interesting topic for the future.

5. Summary and outlook 

5.1. Summary 

This paper provides a critical comprehensive review on the use of 
syngas for IC engines over the last few decades, since syngas has become 
more attractive as an alternative and potentially renewable fuel for IC 
engines. Generally, engine configurations studied in the literature are 
considerably  different  and  the  results  have  been  rather  difficult  to 
compare. An overall observation based on the literature is that the se-
lection of the base fuel for reforming, the syngas production method, its 
physicochemical  properties,  engine  operating  conditions,  and  the  en-
gine design parameters play important roles in dictating the potential 
advantages  of  syngas  use  in  IC  engines.  Some  important  conclusions 
from this review are summarized below: 

• Variation of the hydrogen fraction in syngas has been a factor, pro-
hibiting its widespread usage.  In addition, other gaseous elements 
such as CO2, N2, and CH4 in the syngas can have adverse effects on 
engine combustion characteristics. To address these issues, a better 
understanding of fundamental combustion properties is vital. A large 
set  of experimental data is available for the combustion of syngas 
with various H2/CO contents. However, studies related to ignition 
delay times and laminar flame speeds measurements of syngas mixed 
with other gases under engine relevant conditions are still limited. 
Detailed numerical and experimental studies are required to gap the 
bridge. 

• The most important factors that cause power de-rating in an SI en-
gine are the low energy density of syngas/air mixtures and reduced 
engine volumetric efficiency due to air replacement. With high H2- 
content syngas  addition to  the  engine  as the  secondary fuel, com-
bustion  and  performance  were  better  than  with  low  H2-content 
syngas. Using higher compression ratios in syngas-fueled engines led 
to reduced power de-rating without any increase in the knock ten-
dency. Power de-rating can also be eliminated by direct injection of 
syngas, which is a promising solution to avoid problems of reduced 
volumetric efficiency and unwanted pre-ignition or surface ignition 
in the intake system.  

• Among the different types of engines, syngas as the secondary fuel or 
blended with other fuels in dual-fuel engines showed very interesting 
results  due  to  their  lower  power  de-rating  capability  compared  to 
syngas-fueled SI engines, which have problems running the engine 
under  near  stoichiometric  conditions  and  increased  PM  emissions 
with 100% syngas. High efficiencies with low emissions can be also 
obtained in the whole operating range with the use of appropriate 
strategies in dual-fuel engines. Recently, efforts have been directed 
towards the optimization of these engines with advanced numerical 
techniques. However, the presence of two distinct fuel supply lines is 
a complexity that points out problems related to the storage and the 
transportation of the fuels. 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience90(2022)10099556A. Paykani et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                

• Fuel  reforming  combined  with  dual-fuel  combustion  is  capable  of 
increasing  the  global  efficiency  of  the  system  over  conventional 
diesel combustion. On-board fuel reforming is an attractive method 
to  convert  a  dual-fuel  RCCI  combustion  strategy  into  a  single-fuel 
RCCI  concept  and  thus  eliminates  the  need  for  two  fuel  lines  and 
fuel tanks, which is one of the important demerits of RCCI combus-
tion. On-board catalytic fuel reforming is also a promising technique 
for improving efficiency and reducing pollutant emissions from IC 
engines. Overall, it seems that syngas in a single/dual-fuel engine is a 
promising technique for controlling both NOx and soot emissions in 
existing  engines,  but  with  slight  engine  hardware  modifications 
needed.  

• In  HCCI  engines,  100%  reformate  at  higher  intake  temperature 
would  be  a  suitable  strategy,  compared  to  the  100%  reformate, 
which was more favorable for SI engines at conventional operating 
conditions.  RG  blending  was  found  to  be  an  effective  method  for 
retarding  combustion  phasing,  since  it  reduces  the  heat  release  at 
low  temperatures,  followed  by  a  prolongation  of  the  NTC  delay 
period and a delay in the high-temperature heat release. RG can act 
like an ignition controller for the main engine fuel and can eliminate 
the need for preheating the intake charge. The levels of exhaust CO 
and UHC emissions increase as the RG concentration increases while 
NOx decreases. The chemical effects of RG on HCCI combustion of 
PRFs  were  found  to  be  stronger  than  thermodynamic  effects  and 
dilution.  

• Exhaust  gas  reforming  systems  are  currently  being  considered  in 
different configurations. Fuel choice dictates which R-EGR method is 
preferred. Catalytic on-board fuel reforming can be challenging since 
some hydrocarbon fuels like gasoline require high temperatures to 
reform, and the sulfur content in some fuels can poison the catalyst. 
Another drawback of on-board fuel reforming method using the POX 
method is the reduced LHV of the fuels, thus reducing overall engine 
efficiency. Catalytic R-EGR results showed that good hydrogen rates 
could be produced with adequate control of the reaction parameters 
at  temperatures  typical  of  the  exhaust  gas  temperatures  of  diesel 
engines operating at part load without any external heat source or air 
and steam supply requirements. Overall, the use of R-EGR allowed 
the realization of the benefits of both EGR and waste heat. Moreover, 
a  mixture  diluted  by  R-EGR  can  reduce  the  knock  tendency 
compared  to  EGR  dilution  cases.  With  faster  laminar  burning  ve-
locities, the R-EGR technology is a promising approach to support 
high  levels  of  EGR  dilution  in  advanced  SI  engines  for  increased 
thermal efficiency.  

• In-cylinder fuel reforming techniques like D-EGR/TFR are capable of 
delivering up to 15% more efficient engines than today’s mainstream 
ones, while simultaneously improving engine performance. It allows 
manufacturers  to  address  future,  more  aggressive  fuel  economy 
standards  and  meet  LEV  III/Tier  3  emissions  levels  [604] 
cost-effectively. The results reported in this paper indicate that the 
D-EGR engine can tolerate higher levels of EGR dilution at low loads, 
allow faster burn speeds, minimize cycle-to-cycle variations, and can 
further boost performance and emissions. At high loads, the D-EGR 
technique provides superior knock tolerance and stability over the 
LPL EGR. Disadvantages of in-cylinder reforming strategies include 
slow  kinetics  and  limited  reforming  stoichiometry.  Furthermore, 
homogeneous in-cylinder reforming of heavier fuels like diesel can 
potentially  lead  to excessive  carbon  formation at  rich  equivalence 
ratios. 

Overall,  syngas  combustion  technology  seems  to  have  reached  a 
considerable  level  of  technical  development,  and  the  analysis  of  the 
literature on syngas combustion in IC engines shows the potential for 
widespread research and development work on syngas in the automo-
tive industry in future. 

5.2. Outlook 

Syngas-fueled  IC  engines  with  technological  advancements  are 
attractive and economically viable and can serve as a future option for 
power  and  transportation  applications.  New  measurements  of  the 
laminar flame speed of syngas diluted with other gaseous compositions 
at elevated pressures would help further understand syngas combustion 
kinetics. The main issue with modelling combustion kinetics is the de-
mand  for  expert  knowledge  and  optimization  against  experiments,  as 
well  as  the  lack  of  understanding  of  the  associated  uncertainties. 
Therefore,  data-driven  ML  approaches  that  enable  efficient  discovery 
and calibration of kinetic models can be employed for syngas combus-
tion  modeling  in  coming  years.  The  ML  model  can  be  a  promising 
alternative to time-consuming experimental measurements or numerical 
calculations. 

It is  well documented that supplying  syngas directly to the  intake 
manifold  has  several  limitations,  including  backfire, pre-ignition,  and 
power loss through reduced volumetric efficiency. Transient operation is 
also limited due to the time required for gas to travel through the intake 
system, depending on where it is mixed. Syngas direct injection tech-
nology  can  eliminates  these  limitations  but  requires  high-pressure 
reforming, which could be an area for future study. Numerical models 
should  also  account  for  the  intake  and  exhaust  processes,  which  are 
usually not considered in the simulations of syngas-fueled PFI engines. 
Since  a  considerable  fraction  of  the  power  derating  is  related  to  the 
decrease of volumetric efficiency, those processes should be included in 
the simulations. Similar to DI technology, stratified lean-burn combus-
tion is also an effective way of using syngas in modern engines to address 
problems  associated  with  air-handling  at  lean  stoichiometric  air-fuel 
ratios. However, the required injection durations should be taken due 
into account. For better performance and emissions, further investiga-
tion of the optimization of injection timing, fuel composition, air-fuel 
ratio, and ignition advance are required. 

Studies  have  shown  that  single-fuel  RCCI  combustion  can  achieve 
high  efficiencies  while  maintaining  low  NOx  and  soot  emissions. 
Conversely, the transient performance of the combustion process alone 
(i.e., without the reformer) is assumed to be similar to other gaseous 
dual-fuel engines operating at early direct injection times, which may 
pose additional challenges in combustion control [605,606] if hydrogen 
percentages in the reformed fuel are not kept below those resulting in 
the high-pressure oscillation region. Future work should further analyze 
reformate concentrations and examine fuel reactivity as a function of 
reactor stoichiometry and temperature. In addition, matching reformer 
performance with the engine conditions that enable it to run effectively 
should  also  be  considered. Such  studies  would  provide  invaluable in-
formation to more optimally control combustion, and further define the 
operability range of thermally integrated reforming reactor systems. 

To minimize HC and CO emissions, the efficiency of syngas-operated 
dual-fuel CI engines must be optimized. Moreover, other engine opera-
tional  parameters  should  be  tuned  in  addition  to  the  amount  of 
combustible mixture inside the combustion chamber for achieving bet-
ter  combustion  characteristics.  Based  on  the  present  review,  detailed 
numerical and experimental studies with different compositions of the 
syngas and engine parameters are therefore needed. 

Syngas  production  and  combustion  research  for  IC  engines  have 
mainly  focused  on  steady-state  operating  conditions,  and  very  few 
transient operation studies have been investigated. It is expected that 
there will be challenges to allow reforming systems to work efficiently 
over the entire operating load and speed range. The long-term viability 
of  the  reforming  catalyst  and  the  reforming  reaction’s  response  to  a 
variety of fuels should be examined. In-cylinder reforming processes like 
D-EGR/TFR and NVO are the most promising for on-board syngas pro-
duction. The products of these processes should be evaluated for con-
trolling  combustion  phasing  and  enabling  advanced  combustion 
strategies.  For  D-EGR  vehicles,  the  low  exhaust  temperatures  are  a 
challenge  for  meeting  future  emissions  regulations  because  some

catalytic  aftertreatment  solutions  for  reducing  emissions  are  not 
currently feasible due to poor low temperature activity. Hydrocarbon 
traps are an area of future work for D-EGR- equipped vehicles. The effect 
of reformate composition on combustion and exhaust emissions can also 
be studied in future work. The stability and efficiency of combustion in 
the D-EGR cylinder may be a major concern for D-EGR natural gas en-
gines  and  optimizing  the  equivalence  ratio  of  the  D-EGR  cylinder  is 
crucial  for  D-EGR in  order  to  improve  the  overall  engine  combustion 
output. 

The  research  aimed  at  improving  IC  engine  start-up  and  transient 
behavior  is needed to broaden the range of possible applications. Ex-
amination of heat transfer processes is necessary to illustrate the opti-
mum configuration for complex systems, compared to conventional IC 
engines,  including  multiple  fuel  heating,  evaporation,  and  reforming 
processes  when  using  exhaust  gas  heat,  and  refreshing  the  reforming 
products before they are delivered to the engine. 

Finally, syngas-fueled engines can be optimally designed for hybrid 
electric vehicle application [607], allowing high efficiency operation at 
target  engine  speed  and  loads.  For  hybrid  configuration  research, 
investigating low-carbon fuels and optimized engines according to up-
coming emissions regulations for CO2  will be of particular interest. In 
addition, since most literature research has focused on light duty vehi-
cles, multi-mode hybrid powertrains can be investigated for commercial 
and medium/heavy duty trucks. Thus, there are still numerous issues 
that require further numerical and experimental investigation, particu-
larly  in  the  field  of  on-board  fuel  reforming  and  fundamental  syngas 
combustion studies in IC engines for transport applications.
