The drive toward greener process chemistry has stimulated the development of strong solid acids to replace
traditional catalysts for efficient biodiesel production from free fatty acid (FFA) enriched biomass feed-
stocks. Notably, heterogeneous systems enable simple product isolation procedures and improve the cata-
lyst recyclability. They may also be used in continuous reactors. Increasing interest is directed toward
organic polymer-supported solid acid catalysts, holding the promise of easy incorporation of the catalyst
into the support with high density and easy tuning of the support microstructure/morphology. In the pres-
ent review, the focus is set on the most widely employed members of this class, including cation-exchange
resins, micro- and mesoporous acidic resins, as well as supported acidic ionic liquids and ionomeric mem-
branes. Moreover, we present the use of alternative organic polymer-based acidic catalysts (hybrid sys-
tems). Attention is paid to correlations between parameters such as catalyst morphology, excess of alcohol
required, FFA content in oil feedstock, presence of impurities and the performance of resin-supported acid
catalysts, as well as to the catalyst recyclability. Finally, a brief survey illustrates the use of resin-supported
acid catalysts for the preparation of biofuel additives alkyl levulinates (cid:1) structurally quite similar to the bio-
diesel (cid:1) starting from biomass derived levulinic acid.

1. Introduction

PProcess innovation is the front research of the liquid fuel indus-
try. Most of efforts, indeed, are directed toward reframing the way
of producing conventional biofuels (e.g. sugar-cane ethanol) as well
as their advanced counterpart, i.e. fuels from biomass sources and
lands not used for primary production systems, such as food produc-
tion and farming. Researchers and industry seek for higher process
efficiency, improved product purity, lower power consumption and
ultimately, reduced operating costs. In addition to process innova-
tion, product innovation is also the subject of further research, by
developing new bio-based products that reach ideal conditions for
fuel usage [1].

PThe European Union endorsed a mandatory target of 10% of the
transport fuel consumption coming from renewable sources by
2020. Fuel suppliers are also required to reduce the greenhouse gas
intensity of the EU fuel mix with 6% by 2020 [2]. To effectively
reduce greenhouse gas emissions without adversely affecting envi-
ronmental social sustainability, biofuels must be produced in a sus-
tainable manner [2]. To start with, sustainable feedstocks must be
selected in accordance with the EU Renewable Energy Directive to
provide at least 35% net CO2 emission savings (in comparison to fos-
sil fuels), but at the same time they should benefit local communities
in terms of food availability, economical and labor benefits, human
and property rights as well as preservance of local biodiversity and
soil and water quality used for the biomass production [2]. Sustain-
able feedstocks typically include lignocellulosic residues from

Pagriculture and forestry, fast-rotation non-edible crops, organic frac-
tions of urban waste and algae [1,3]. However, sustainable biofuel
production also implies the use of clean, safe, efficient and viable
manufacturing processes [1(cid:1)3].

1.1. Fatty acid methyl esters

low-toxic and biodegradable diesel

PBiodiesel consists of a mixture of long chain C10(cid:1)(cid:1)C22 fatty acid
(FA) alkyl esters, generally methyl esters (FAMEs, Fig. 1a). It is a
sustainable,
fuel substitute
produced and used worldwide. It has been proved to enable low
emissions of particulate matter, CO2, CO, polycyclic aromatic hydro-
carbons, sulfur oxide and nitric polycyclic hydrocarbons. Further-
more, it has superior lubricity, high flash point and cetane number
[4(cid:1)6].

PBiodiesel can be manufactured from a variety of feedstocks, rang-
ing from (in)edible vegetal feedstock (e.g., sunflower, rapeseed,
Jatropha curcas, palm and soybean oil) to animal fats and waste cook-
ing oil [5(cid:1)7]. Microalgae are also an emerging feedstock, since they
hold the promise of cost-competitive biodiesel production, although
much work is still required in the field. In fact, algal species can pro-
duce biomass very rapidly, and have the capacity to produce energy-
rich oil in high yield. They can be grown on marginal or non-arable
land and, additionally, they may be efficient in removing nutrients
from water, thereby enabling waste stream remediation in the pro-
cess of culturing these microalgae. [7] The use of inedible vegetal or
waste cooking oils is preferred because of their low price and

Pbecause they do not interfere with the food and feed production
market. However, these feedstocks often present a high content of
free fatty acids (FFAs) along with water, as well as traces of metal
salts, which may interfere with the biodiesel production process
(see below). Biodiesel is produced by transesterification reactions
between triglycerides (Fig. 1b) from vegetal oils or fats and an alco-
hol. Crude glycerol is the main by-product of biodiesel production,
accounting for about 10% by weight of the starting material. It is
worth mentioning here that both industry and academia are putting
a lot of efforts into conversion of crude glycerol co-product into ani-
mal feedstuff, commodity chemicals and polymers [7(cid:1)9], thereby
paving the way to lower biodiesel production cost as well as pro-
mote its industrialization on a large scale.

PThe transesterification process can be assisted by a wide range of
catalysts (Fig. 2) to improve the overall efficiency, including homo-
geneous (bases, acids and metal complexes), phase transfer and het-
erogeneous catalysts and biocatalysts (enzymes). A number of
excellent reviews have been recently published, which give an over-
view of the state art in the field [7,10(cid:1)18].

PFor the industrial production process, however, the triglycerides
are most commonly converted into biodiesel with the help of homo-
geneous strong base catalysts such as alkali metal hydroxides and
alkoxides. Such a process may present a severe drawback, that trans-
lates into high production cost. More specifically, when the base cat-
alyst is in the presence of FFAs, it produces soap, which is not
desirable since it contaminates the fuel by dispersing the byproduct
glycerol, thereby lowering the fuel yield by interfering with the
phase separation of the fuel and glycerol, and, ultimately, rising
the production costs. Thus, the refining process to remove FFAs in
the raw oil to less than 3% wt is normally required for the biodiesel
fuel production [19,20].

PRecently, catalytic decarboxylation of fatty acids either in the
presence or without hydrogen has been reported as “pre-treatment”
step [21(cid:1)23]. Another (cid:1) more consolidated (cid:1) strategy involves an
esterification reaction with alcohol typically acid-catalyzed by

Phomogeneous acids such as sulfuric acid, though they must be sub-
sequently neutralized and disposed. Moreover, the concomitant
requirement of high temperatures is associated to equipment corro-
sion problems. Therefore, development of efficient and stable acid
catalysts that can improve markedly the efficiency of biodiesel pro-
duction still stands as a great challenge.

1.2. Heterogeneous acid-catalyzed esterification

POver the past decade, the advances in heterogeneous acid cataly-
sis for biofuels and biofuel additives has been a very active research
area because their employment sets several advantages compared to
their homogeneous counterparts. For example, replacing conven-
tional homogeneous catalysts with heterogeneous ones can over-
come problems related to equipment corrosion [10]. Moreover,
heterogeneous catalysts are attractive as in general they can be
easily recycled by filtration or decantation, thereby minimizing the
production of waste. They open the possibility to convert batch
arrangements (typical of homogeneously catalyzed reactions) into
continuous operations using flow-through fixed bed reactors, which
paves the way to process intensification [24(cid:1)26]. All this contributes
to the setting of protocols in support of a sustainable biofuel produc-
tion system. On the other hand, such catalytic systems may suffer
from lower activity and/or selectivity compared to their homoge-
neous counterpart, which may be due in part to (1) the effects of
mass transfer (or diffusion) between the different phases of catalyst,
reactant(s) and product(s); (2) the accessibility of catalytic sites by
the reagents in solution; (3) the site heterogeneity.

PIn view of acid catalyzed biodiesel production, it should be
highlighted that there is an important difference in the reaction
mechanism between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalyzed
esterification. This difference is mainly related to the difference in
hydrophobicity of the catalyst surface. This is especially evident for
lipophilic reactants such as fatty acids [27,29]. Three different sce-
narios are possible, as reported by Rothenberg and co-workers [27]:

P(1) if there is one isolated (hydrophilic) Bronsted acid site, sur-
rounded by a hydrophobic environment, the lipophilic tail of e.g.,
the fatty acid would likely approach and adsorb in a parallel fashion
with respect to the hydrophobic surface (Fig. 3, top); (2) if there are
a few acid sites near there, the fatty acid molecules could adsorb per-
pendicularly to the surface, with the lipophilic tail forming locally a
hydrophobic environment (Fig. 3, middle); (3) in the case of a very
acidic and/or hydrophilic material (i.e. many adjacent sites and/or
hydroxy groups), the by-product water produced during the esterifi-
cation process would adsorb preferentially on the surface (Fig. 3,
bottom). Water causes the catalyst to deactivate (i.e. the water layer
would prevent the access of acid and alcohol to the catalyst). On the
other hand, when there is an excess of alcohol, that mixes better
with water than with fatty acid, the reaction mixture remains some-
how monophasic until equilibrium conversion is reached, and there-
fore, no catalyst deactivation would be observed. Thus, efficient
heterogeneous catalysts are those which can lower the reaction tem-
perature (mass transfer) and reduce the excess of alcohol required
(catalyst activity). Additionally, the challenge is to develop heteroge-
neous catalyst production systems that can be used for a wide vari-
ety of feedstocks [27].

PA variety of robust and industrially benign heterogeneous acid
catalysts have been used since recent times for short- and long
chain FFA esterification, as well as for simultaneous esterification/
transesterification reactions, including supported heteropolyacids,
zeolites, hybrid catalysts, carbon-based materials functionalized
with sulphonic groups, sulfated metal oxides, metal organic frame-
work (MOF) structures, and mesoporous silicas [10,11,14,28,30(cid:1)35].
A number of excellent reviews have been published on these
approaches, and the interested reader is referred to them for details
[10,11,14,28,30(cid:1)32]. In the general context of heterogeneous cata-
lysts, organic polymer-supported systems are among the most ver-
satile ones. In particular, the development of efficient, functional
group tolerant, controlled and living polymerization methods has
allowed to synthesize diverse ranges of structures, to tune the den-
sity of catalytic sites along the polymers and to incorporate catalytic

Pcenters into polymer structures easily [36(cid:1)42]. A significant number
of studies have been carried out in the last few years on the produc-
tion of biofuels through (trans)esterification reactions mediated by
resin-supported acid catalysts. Despite the achievements, to the best
of our knowledge, to date no reviews focusing exclusively (nor
extensively) on such topic have been reported. Thus, in the present
review we first present an overview of cation-exchange resin-medi-
ated (trans)esterification reactions to FAMEs, which stands as the
most widely explored route in the field to date. Next, we critically
summarize the progress made with micro- and mesoporous acidic
resins, as well as with supported acidic ionic liquids and ionomeric
membranes. Moreover, the use of alternative organic polymer-based
acidic catalysts is discussed, including hybrid systems. Wherever
applicable, within each section, the focus is set on the correlation
between parameters such as catalyst morphology, amount of alco-
hol, FFA content in (waste) oil feedstock, presence of impurities
including water and the performance of resin-supported acid cata-
lysts, as well as on catalyst recyclability. Finally, we give a brief sur-
vey of the studies related to the use of resin-supported acids as
catalysts for the preparation of alkyl levulinates by upgrading the
biomass derived platform molecule levulinic acid [43,44]. Levulinic
acid esters are structurally related to FAMEs and possess significant
potential as oxygenated blend components in diesel formulations.
Such esters do confer improved oxidative stability, low temperature
properties and lower gum formation tendency upon addition to
(bio)fuels [45,46]. The most studied is a formulation for low-smoke
diesel developed by Biofine and Texaco that uses ethyl levulinate as
oxygenated additive [47]. Additionally, ethyl levulinate has been
tested as an additive for transportation fuels to improve emissions
of nitrogen oxides in high compression diesel engines [48,49]. Also,
ethyl levulinate has been studied as a 100% biodegradable neat fuel
for the near future [50].

2. Cation exchange resins

PSulphonated co-polymers of styrene (S) and divinylbenzene
(DVB) are by far the most widely used acid ion exchange resins
(Fig. 4, left). The amount of crosslinking component (DVB) is one of
the main determinants of the resin surface area and pore-size distri-
bution. Suspension polymerization is generally used for the prepara-
tion of co-polymer networks in the form of beads of varying
diameter. So-called gel-type resins are prepared from e.g., styrene
monomer in the presence of DVB (typically < 5 mol%) and no other
components except the polymerization initiator [51]. The resulting
materials typically consist of hard glassy transparent beads, with
low surface area in the dry state (<10 m2g¡1 by Brunauer Emmett
Teller (BET) method) and ultimately, a rather low penetrability into
the network segments. However, gel-type resins are able to swell in
“good” solvents (i.e. solvents with solubility parameters similar to
that of the polymer), giving rise to a porous structure and becoming
readily accessible. The swelling level is inversely related to the
cross-linker (DVB) content [51]. So-called macroporous (macrore-
ticular) resins are typically prepared from e. g styrene in the pres-
ence of substantial amounts of DVB (10(cid:1)80 mol %). Importantly,
the term “macroporous” in this context indicates a class of resins
featuring a permanent porous structure, even in the dry state. The

Ppermanent porous morphology of these resins is generated when
introducing an appropriate organic solvent (porogen or “pore for-
mer”) which induces the growth of the polymer network and even-
tually phase separation/precipitation during the polymerization
[51]. At the end of polymerization, when the porogen is removed,
hard but opaque resin beads with a porous structure are formed.
Macroporous resins can have much higher surface area in the dry
state (50(cid:1)100 m2g¡1) [51] than gel-type resins and tend to exhibit a
wide pore size distribution ranging from micropores (<20 A
) to mes-
opores (20(cid:1)500 A
). Notably, a fine control
) to macropores (>500 A
over this morphology can be achieved by choosing the nature and
amount of porogen and cross-linker employed [51]. Perfluorinated
acidic ion exchangers based on sulphonic acid groups represent
another well-known class of (non-porous) solid acid materials which
have been reported to have an acidity close to that of 100% H2SO4
[52(cid:1)54]. In particular, Nafion resin (e.g. Nafion NR50(cid:1)) is a co-poly-
mer of tetrafluoroethylene and perfluoro-2-(fluorosulphonylethoxy)
propyl vinyl ether, which after hydrolysis of the sulfonyl fluoride
yields the strongly acidic terminal -CF2CF2SO3H groups. (Fig. 4,
right). Nafion resins are commercially available as millimeter-sized
beads and its surface area in this form is very low.

PIon exchange resins are commonly used for diverse organic trans-
formations, including esterification and transesterification reactions
[52,55(cid:1)66]. For instance Amberlyst 15(cid:1), a well-known commer-
cially available macroreticular styrene based sulphonic acid has
been frequently used for promoting the esterification of simple sub-
strates such as acetic acid with different alcohols and in different
reactor configurations [67(cid:1)70]. In this context, Rothenberg and co-
workers [27] used for the esterification of lauric acid (C-12 FA) with
2-ethylhexanol (150 °C) two different well-known different organic
ion-exchange resins, i.e., Amberlyst 15 and Nafion-NR 50 (3 wt%),
keeping in mind that Amberlyst-15 has large pore volumes
(4.8 cm3g¡1) as well as BET surface area (ca. 50 m2g¡1) while Nafion
NR50 is non-porous (BET surface area »0.02 m2g¡1). Both catalysts
showed high catalytic activity at an early stage of the reaction with
Amberlyst 15 reaching 96% conversion. The lower FA conversion
with Nafion-NR 50 (78%) is partially attributed to the limited swell-
ing degree of the polymer matrix of such non-porous ion exchange
catalyst at low alcohol content (alcohol/acid molar ratio 1:1) [71].
No side reactions such as ether formation and/or alcohol dehydra-
tion were observed. These results make Amberlyst-15 and Nafion
NR50 good esterification candidates, but under the described condi-
tions they deactivated after 2 and 4.5 h, respectively. The faster deac-
tivation of
the porous resin may likely be due to solvation
(poisoning) of the catalytic sites by water produced during the ester-
¡ is formed) as well as to
ification (i.e., hydrated proton -H3O+-SO3
water adsorption on the inner/outer surfaces, which may hinder the
accessibility of the hydrophobic lauric acid molecules [72].

PMore recently, Amberlyst 15 was successfully employed in the
simultaneous esterification and transesterification for biodiesel pro-
duction. Kusakabe and co-workers esterified oleic acid in the pres-
ence of methanol, using a three-phase fixed bed reactor packed with
Amberlyst 15 and an optimal alcohol: acid molar ratio of 6:1, achiev-
ing conversions up to 93% at 100 °C [73]. When the operational tem-
perature exceeds the water boiling point, it starts to evaporate and
being removed with the methanol vapor flow, thereby shifting the
equilibrium toward the product side. Additionally, no catalyst was
observed during the first 5 h. In the same study, the authors showed
that by addition of sunflower oil to oleic acid simultaneous esterifi-
cation and transesterification occurred, but at lower conversions to
FAME (65 and 55% with 75 and 50 wt% FFA, respectively). Marchetti
and co-workers explored the activity of Amberlyst 15 using ethanol
as the alcohol for oleic acid esterification [74]. With 20 wt% catalyst
at 60 °C, the acid conversion reached 53% after 6 h. Remarkably,
the optimal reactants molar ratio was found to be 1:1. The authors
claimed that, although this finding is counterintuitive (the

Pesterification being an equilibrium reaction), it can be explained by
the fact that the reaction was considered at an initial stage. There-
fore, the observed effect is that equimolar reactants enable the high-
est initial reaction rate. Some loss of catalyst activity was observed
after a single re-use of the catalyst, which was attributed to the poi-
soning of active sites by water. Interestingly, when Amberlyst-15
was employed in the transesterification of triolein (acid value
2.5 mgKOHg¡1) with methanol by Paterson et al. [75],
it was
observed that the products acid value increased, whereas the addi-
tion of up to 15% of stearic acid or 1% water did not affect the reac-
tion products, which led to the conclusion that hydrolysis and
esterification side reactions were taking place under these condi-
tions. Optimized reaction conditions (97% conversion) were a meth-
anol: oil molar ratio of 24:1, 13 wt% catalyst, 200 °C (4 MPa) and 10 h
reaction time. Studies on the Amberlyst-15 recyclability showed
that the activity of the third run was ca. 17% of the fresh catalyst
activity.

PVery recently Boz et al. [76] compared the performance of
Amberlyst-15 and modified Amberlyst-15 for the biodiesel produc-
tion through esterification/transesterification of waste cooking oil
(FFA content of 1.04%) with methanol [76]. The modified Amberlyst
15 catalysts (A15-1, A15-2 and A15-3) were prepared by thermal
treatment at 220 °C for different times (4, 24 and 48 h, respectively).
Such treatment led to a markedly decreased hydrogen exchange
capacity over time compared to neat Amberlyst-15. On the other
hand, BET surface area and porosity increased, due to the formation
of surface macro-cracks. The best results (78% conversion) were
obtained in the presence of neat Amberlyst 15 (3 wt%), employing a
12:1 methanol: oil molar ratio at 65 °C (9 h). As a general trend, the
conversions increased linearly with the resins hydrogen exchange
capacity, pointing out the key role of this parameter. Recyclability
studies revealed that Amberlyst 15 maintained its original activity
for three consecutive reaction cycles, with the catalyst being washed
and subsequently dried between runs. When excess FFA was added
to the waste cooking oil, esterification and transesterification took
place simultaneously, with FFA conversion reaching a maximum ca.
40%. This rather poor result was explained on the basis of catalyst
poisoning by the water generated as co-product of the esterification,
as well as of the hydrolysis of triglycerides promoted by the water
itself, thereby emphasizing the need of continuous water removal
from the reaction mixture. Ilgen and co-workers explored the poten-
tial of commercially available macroreticular Amberlyst 46 for the
esterification of neat oleic acid with methanol [77,78]. When the
reaction was performed at 3:1 alcohol excess and 15 wt% catalyst at
100 °C (2 h) optimal conversion was achieved (98%). Interestingly, as
a general trend, higher methanol excess (9:1) was found to be detri-
mental for the catalyst efficiency, leading to lower conversions. A
high amount of alcohol was thought to prevent the proper interac-
tion between the acid and the catalyst by blocking the active sites.
Interestingly, a negligible loss of catalyst activity (2%) was observed
after ten reaction cycles. No indications about possible catalyst
regeneration between runs were reported. By using a model sun-
flower oil feedstock containing 6% oleic acid, a 6:1 methanol: acid
molar ratio and 20 wt% catalyst, esterification/transesterification
conversions reached as high as 76% (130 °C,10 h). As to the recycla-
bility of Amberlyst 46, the catalyst showed 15% activity loss after
four reaction cycles, which was partially attributed to the incom-
plete mass recovery upon filtration. The ion exchanger was sub-
jected to drying in between runs. Four different ion exchange resins
made of styrene and DVB containing strong sulphonic acid groups
(Amberlyst-15, Amberlyst-16, Amberlyst-131 and Relite CFS) were
compared by Santacesaria and co-workers under batch and continu-
ous modes for the esterification of a mixture of FFA (oily mixture of
oleins) as well as the simultaneous esterification/transesterification
of oleic acid and soybean oil with methanol [79(cid:1)84]. All the catalysts
featured 20(cid:1)25% crosslinking degree, acidity of 4.7 meqg¡1 and

Pparticle average diameter of 0.7 mm. Relite CFS in particular exhib-
ited high activity in batch conditions, reaching 80% FFA conversion
after 2 h. The reaction was carried out at 85 °C using methanol: olein
molar ratios of 8:1 and 2.5 wt% catalyst. Furthermore, different con-
tinuous reactor configurations were explored, among which a pilot-
scale fixed bed tubular reactor (Fig. 5, left) operated on stream for
relatively long time (242 h) producing biodiesel with conversions
over 95%. The reactor comprised a stainless steel tubular reactor
(50 cm £ 8.2 cm i.d.) containing ca. 1 kg ion exchange resin and
stainless steel springs to compensate the swelling effect and there-
fore avoiding excessive pressure drops along the catalytic bed. Meth-
anol and FFA were mixed in a reservoir (0.72:1 wt ratio, 35 °C), then
fed to the reactor (1Lh¡1) which was kept at 100 °C and 6 bars to
maintain methanol in the liquid state. Unfortunately, Relite CFS
underwent deactivation via both fouling phenomena derived from
the raw nature of the feed and ion exchange with metals (mainly
Iron) also present in the feed. A visual confirmation of the resin alter-
ation with respect to its initial state was a pronounced discoloration
of beads during continuous operation (Fig. 5, right). The resin could
be regenerated by treatment with H2SO4 (24 h) followed by a time-
consuming washing/drying protocol.

PPark et al. investigated the activities of Amberlyst 15 and BD20
for the esterification of FFA enriched oils (50% and 99%) with metha-
nol [72,85]. Amberlyst BD20 is a gel-type ion exchanger manufac-
tured by Dow Chemicals and presents an average particle diameter
of 750 mm, 5.10 eqkg¡1 acidity and a BET surface area <0.1 m2g¡1.
Optimal conditions were found at 20% wt catalyst and 6:1 methanol
excess (80 °C). Under these conditions both catalysts demonstrated
high activity, with a residual FFA content in the oils between 0.2%
and 3%. However, the activity of Amberlyst 15 decreased both with
(1) increasing amount of water content in the feedstock oil and pro-
duced during the esterification process and (2) recycling of the cata-
lyst. The authors attributed this to poisoning of acid sites by water
solvation and poorer accessibility of reactants to the acid sites
located inside the pores due to poor water removal from the pores.
Amberlyst BD20 in contrast did show good water tolerance. A tenta-
tive explanation was given by considering the non-porous structure
of Amberlyst BD20 vs. the porous Amberlyst 15 (BET surface area ca.
40 m2g¡1), the former showing very little water adsorption on the
inner and/or outer surface. This was supported by the fact that the
activity of both catalysts was not hindered when only small amounts
of water were produced in soybean oil with low FFA content (2.5%).
To overcome the decrease in activity of Amberlyst-15 by water in

Poils with high FFA content, the authors considered a two-step esteri-
fication of oleic acid and high-acid acid oil (HAAO). By replacing the
methanol (3 equiv.) and catalyst (2.6% wt) with fresh ones after
30 min., the time to reach FAME yields over 90% was reduced from 5
to 1.7 h (80 °C). The 30-min mark was chosen according to the point
at which water accumulated considerably. Similarly, the analogous
two-step esterification of HAAO reduced the reaction time from 6 to
1.8 h to reach FAME yields over 85%.

PJe(cid:4)rabeck et al. demonstrated that the alcohol: acid ratio was det-
rimental for the esterification kinetics [86,87] and the morphology
of the ion exchange catalyst under operational conditions. At a con-
centration of methanol above 20%, the oil and methanol components
formed two separate phases, i.e., a predominant methanol-saturated
oil phase and an alcohol-rich phase, with conversions over 50% using
Amberlyst BD-20 starting from a synthetic mixture of stearic acid
(5% wt) in a low acid vegetable oil (0.04%). For methanol concentra-
tions below this limit, a homogeneous methanol unsaturated
mixture was observed where conversion started to decrease. Impor-
tantly, it was observed that the specific volume of the catalyst bed
decreased with decreasing alcohol concentration, indicating shrink-
ing of the polymer matrix under those conditions, preventing the
access of the reaction mixture to the acid sites. This finding sup-
ported the hypothesis that poorer conversions are not simply a
result of lower reactant content, but also of change in ion-exchange
catalyst morphology (swelling degree). For comparison purposes,
three sulphonated polystyrene-based macroreticular resins featur-
ing a DVB crosslinking degree of 15%, 40% and 60% were considered
(M-15, M-40 and M-60, respectively). The reaction was performed
in continuous mode, using flow-through fixed bed reactors.
In
this case, the lowest conversion was achieved when the reaction
mixture was methanol-saturated. When the methanol concentration
decreased to 5(cid:1)10%, the FFA conversion increased up to a maximum
(25(cid:1)35%). The authors stated that under methanol-saturated condi-
tions, the sulphonic alcohol groups become less available for interac-
tion with the hydrophilic heads of the fatty acids. As a consequence,
the sulphonic groups were much less efficient than their “free” coun-
terparts. By decreasing the methanol concentration in the reaction
mixture, the fatty acids start to compete with methanol for the sul-
phonic acid groups. Finally, the authors observed that the lower the
crosslinking degree of the macroreticular catalysts, the higher the
difference was between swollen and “shrinked” morphologies and
therefore the effect of the decrease in methanol concentration on
the reaction kinetics was more distinct. A very recent study reports

Pthe production of biodiesel using a combination of Amberlyst BD20
and choline chloride-glycerol (Chcl-gly) deep eutectic solvent (DES)
[88]. Nearly quantitative conversion (98%) was achieved after
100 min. esterification of oleic acid with methanol at 85 °C (12:1
alcohol: acid molar ratio, 20 wt% catalyst and 2:8 catalyst: DES mass
ratio). The Chcl-gly hydrogen-bonding characteristics were found to
be well suited for “subtracting” water from the reaction mixture,
thereby promoting FFA esterification. Lower FFA conversions were
observed in all experiments when macroreticular Amberlyst-15 was
used with varying amount of DES. Taking into account the difference
in porous nature of Amberlyst 15 and BD20, the water adsorption
capacity of Amberlyst 15 resulted stronger than that of DES and
therefore in case the catalyst activity did decrease. Additionally, sig-
nificant deactivation of Amberlyst-15 was observed after being re-
used twice, whereas Amberlyst BD-20 showed only ca. 10% activity
loss after four cycles. This was attributed to the extensive water/DES
coverage of active sites both on the surface and within the pore
structure of Amberlyst 15 during the esterification process, as seen
from BET specific surface analysis and pore volume measurements
before and after reaction.

PIn 2016, Fu et al. studied the effect of impurities (metal ions,
organic acids others than FFA and water) in used cooking oil on
the biodiesel production over 10 wt% Amberlyst BD-20 and 15 at
70(cid:1)100 °C (5(cid:1)14 and 1(cid:1)14% conversion for Amberlyst BD20 and 15,
respectively) [89,90]. Results from the reaction without catalyst
indicated that Fe+3 (i.e., the dominant metal ion) can act as Lewis
acid catalyst in the esterification reaction, but shows a deactivation
effect on resin catalysts through metal exchange. For high methanol:
FFA molar ratios the latter phenomenon became predominant due
to the higher viscosity of the reaction mixture and the higher disper-
sion of Fe+3 in the alcohol phase, promoting the metal ion exchange.
The authors also considered the deactivation effect of water, which
form highly stable hydrated protons on resin catalysts. This effect
could be reduced by raising the reaction temperature, but not by
increasing the methanol concentration. Non-FFA organic acids were
found to be highly active in promoting the esterification reaction,
showing synergy with the sulphonated resins.

PHoelderich and co-workers investigated the pre-esterification of
various FFA containing vegetable oils with methanol, using three
different resins, i.e., EBD-100, EBD-200 and EBD-300 [91]. These
EBD resins are sulphonic acid functionalized styrene/DVB co-poly-
mers, featuring a gel-type (EBD 100, Fig. 6a) and a macroporous
morphology (EBD-200 and EBD-300, Fig. 6b and c). The gel-type
EBD resin exhibited an ion-exchange capacity (IEC) of 5.37 molkg¡1
while the macroporous resins hadan IEC of 2.81 (EBD-200) and
3.33 (EBD-300). The authors found that the catalytic performance
of EBD-100 was superior to that of macroporous EBD-200 and
¡300, leading to 100% FFA conversion and (TOF 1.55 h¡1). Most
probably the low cross-linking degree of the gel-type EBD-100
resulted in a higher swelling and methanol uptake. Additionally, it
can be argued that the acidic sites in EBD-100 were accessible for
the reactants to a large extent, whereas for macroporous resins

Ponly a fraction of the sulphonic acid groups were accessible via the
catalyst surface, most of the active sites being embedded in the
dense polymer matrix. Importantly, a fast catalyst deactivation was
observed after four cycles, which was attributed to continuous ion-
exchanges with traces of salt contaminants present in the oil feed-
stock (e.g., Na+, Mg2+ and Ca2+). However, deactivation was showed
to be a reversible process, since it was possible to restore the origi-
nal catalyst activity by regeneration with hydrochloric acid wash-
ing. Hidaka and co-workers [92] compared the performance of
Amberlyst 15 and the gel-type Amberlyst 31 resin for the esterifica-
tion of oleic acid with methanol [92]. The reaction was carried out
using a large excess of methanol (70:1 molar ratio), in the presence

of 100 wt% catalyst at 60 °C (1.5 h).
reports, the gel-type resin revealed to be more active than the mac-
roreticular Amberlyst 15 leading to a 13% conversion increase
(82 vs. 69%, respectively), not only because of the larger accessibil-
ity of the catalytic sites but also because of greater hydrogen
exchange capacity of Amberlyst 31 vs. Amberlyst 15 (7.1 vs.
5.4 mmolg¡1). Interestingly, Amberlyst 31 lost only ca. 15% of its
original activity after four reaction cycles.

PLiu and Wang [93] performed the esterification of rapeseed
oil deodorizer distillate (with acid value 97.6 mg KOHg¡1, i.e., ca.
50 wt% FFA content) in the presence of a cation-exchange macrore-
ticular polystyrene resin, namely D002 (32% DVB crosslinker,
IEC4.0 mmolg¡1and particle size 0.05 nm). Conversions up to 96%
were reached in a fixed-bed reactor with 18 wt% catalyst at 9:1
methanol: oil ratio and at 60 °C (4 h). The liquid mixture of methanol
and raw oil was circulated at 1 mLmin¡1 to ensure long residence
time sufficient for complete conversion. Interestingly, when the
same reaction was performed using 002CR and 732 gel type resins
with higher crosslinking degree (35% and 38%) and IEC comparable
to the macro-reticular one (4.5(cid:1)5.0% mmolg¡1), but with bigger par-
ticle size (1.18 and 1.28 nm) the maximum conversion obtained was
only 74%. This apparent discrepancy with the trend of the results
obtained by Park [72,85], Hoelderich [91] and Hidaka [92] may be, at
least in part, attributed to the differences in catalyst particle size.
€
Ozbey et al. [94] observed that the macroreticular resins
Similarly,
Amberlyst-15, 35 and 16 were more effective than the gel-type
Dowex HCR W2 in the esterification reaction of FFA contained in
waste cooking oil. Particularly, higher BET surface area and average
pore diameter were found to be more effective in promoting the
esterification reaction than the swelling capacity (i.e., low crosslink-
ing degree), the order of catalytic activity being Amberlyst 15>
Amberlyst 35> Amberlyst 16> Dowex HCR W2. Here it should
be noted, however, that the FFA content in the employed waste
cooking oil was only ca. 0.5%, and, therefore, the reaction produced
only small amounts of water. Feng et al. compared three different
styrene/DVBcation exchange resins, namely NKC-9, 001 £ 7 and D-
61, for the esterification of high acid value (13.7 mgg¡1KOH) waste
fried oil with methanol [95(cid:1)97]. The macroreticular NKC-9 gave the
best result under the reaction conditions studied (6:1 methanol: oil
molar ratio, 20 wt% catalyst, 64 °C, 2 h), leading to a FFA conversion

Pof ca. 80%. NKC-9 exhibited a high average pore diameter (56 nm)
which was helpful for the reactants to access the active sites of the
resin. Macroreticular resin D61 in turn, having a similar BET surface
area (84 vs. 77 m2g¡1) but smaller average pore diameter (ca. 11 nm)
gave the lowest conversion (10%). Under identical reaction conditions,
gel-type 001 £ 7 resin enabled conversions up to 32%. The authors
claimed that NKC-9 had the lowest moisture content (<10 vs. 50% for
D61 and 0.01 £ 7, respectively), which enabled a better adsorption of
the water produced during esterification. However, this may be argu-
able, since the experimental procedure reports a pre-treatment of
001 £ 7 and D-61, which includes washing with methanol to displace
water in the resin, followed by storage under airtight conditions.
Additionally, the authors studied the re-usability of the best perform-
ing NKC-9 resin and observed the conversion even to be slightly
increased during the first ten runs, but also a poor mass recovery due
to extensive breakdown of the catalyst particles under mechanical
stirring. The authors highlighted that such improved catalytic
properties were likely due to the resin enhanced surface area
during fragmentation. To face this issue, in subsequent studies,
the same group developed a continuous FFA esterification proto-
col employing different sizes of fixed bed reactors (catalyst bed
of 450 mm £ 25 mm i.d.) packed with NKC-9. All the reactors
comprised a water-jacketed stainless steel column with side out-
lets. With a feed solution at 0.8 mL min¡1flow rate and a 1.25:1
methanol: acid molar ratio, an impressive 96% conversion of FFA
in the waste fried oil (acid value 36.0 mgg¡1KOH) was achieved
at 65 °C. Notably, no significant catalyst deactivation was
observed after 500 h on stream.

PFu et al. [71] investigated the esterification reaction of FFA mixed
with rapeseed oil (50 wt% FFA content) and methanol by using a
self-synthesized macroreticular polystyrene-based sulphonated
exchanger (CLD-50). The main features of such resin were 50% cross-
linking degree, 3.4 mmolg¡1 IEC, 185 m2g¡1 BET surface area and
97 nm average pore diameter. Under the optimal conditions of 15:1
methanol: acid molar ratio, 10 wt% catalyst and 100 °C (3 h), CLD-50
resin enabled a FFA conversion as high as 98%. In a separate set of
experiments, the effect of water (0(cid:1)5 wt%) on the CLD-50 activity
was also studied. A comparison with a (not specified) commercial
resin featuring gel-type morphology was also made. CLD-50 was
sensitive to both water present in the oil feedstock (rH2O) and water
produced during the esterification (pH2O). More specifically, the
authors demonstrated that the two catalysts behaved differently
with different water sources (Fig. 7). The macroporous resin is more
affected by rH2O (initially absorbed water), but shows a relatively

Pbetter tolerance to pH2O (feedstocks with high FFA content). This
observation supported the authors(cid:3)hypothesis that a higher FFA con-
centration competes more for the active sites with produced water
and therefore reduces the pH2O deactivation effect. On the other
hand, gel type resin resulted less sensitive to rH2O since it presented
a low surface area (<0.1 m2g¡1). However, the limited active sites
restricted its performance with high FFA content raw feedstocks.
Finally, the authors explored the recyclability of macroporous CLD-
50 and found ca. 7% activity loss after ten reaction cycles, with cata-
lyst washing/drying in between runs. The reduced performance was
attributed to physical damage of the resin beads. A better stability,
in terms of activity as well as mechanical resistance was evidenced
for the gel-type resin.

PRecently, Zecca and co-workers developed a series of novel gel-
type polystyrene based hydrogen exchanger through acylation of
the supports by means of acetyl-, butyroyl- and caproyl-chloride, to
tune the hydrophilic character of the resulting catalysts [98]. The
acylation degree ranged from 50 to 80%, whereas the IEC varied in
the range of 2.8(cid:1)4.2 mmol g¡1. The activity of these catalysts was
studied for the esterification of stearic acid (5 wt% mixture in oil)
with methanol in a flow-through fixed-bed reactor at 85 °C. At high
methanol concentration (20 wt%) the catalyst activity was mainly
influenced by the degree of swelling, and therefore, the best per-
forming catalyst was the most hydrophilic one (i.e., the non-acylated
reference material). Despite its lower swelling degree (4.5 vs.
6.6 cm3g¡1) the more hydrophobic caproyl functionalized catalyst
showed similar conversion (ca. 75% at 77 h¡1 weight hourly space
velocity (WHSV)) which was attributed to the enhanced adsorption
of stearic acid near and on the catalytic site, assisted by the hydro-
phobic groups. For lower methanol concentrations (5 wt%), the
swelling degree was similar for all the catalysts, but it was observed
that the (low) activity generally increased with the hydrophobic
character of the catalyst, with the caproyl functionalized system giv-
ing once more the optimal result. An interesting contribution by
Lachter and co-workers [99] describes the results on the esterifica-
tion/transesterification of soybean oil (acid value: 1.74 mgKOHg¡1
oil) with methanol in the presence of lab-synthesized sulphonated
macroporous polyDVB resin CAT-30a [99]. The synthesized resin
exhibited 3.4 meq. H+/g¡1 IEC, 442 m2g¡1BET surface area and
0.90 cm3g¡1 pore volume. When the reaction was performed in the
presence of large excess of methanol (300:1 methanol: oil molar
ratio) and catalyst (100 wt%), a conversion to FAME of 97%
was achieved after 8 h at 65 °C. Unfortunately, no data on catalyst
re-utilization were available.

PTo sum up, some major points can be given here with respect to

sulphonated cation exchange resins for the biodiesel production.

PThus, it has been seen that a good number of studies have been
performed on the influence of morphology of ion-exchange resins in
catalyzing the FFAs esterification. To cite again some examples, Park
[72,85], J(cid:4)erabeck [86,87], and Hidaka [92] demonstrated that the cat-
alysts activity may be mainly influenced by its swelling capacity, the
gel-type resins being more effective than the porous Amberlyst 15
benchmark at high alcohol-to-FFAs molar ratios. We have seen that
further support in this direction was given by Hoelderich and cow-
€
orkers [91]. On the opposite, Liu [93] and
Ozbey [94] reported exper-
imental results showing that permanently porous resins may be
more effective in promoting the esterification of FFAs in waste oils.
Here, it should be highlighted that parameters like feedstock FFAs
content [94] may account, at least in part, for the discrepancy
between the result trends. Next, adding hydrophobicity to catalyst
surfaces may increase the catalyst activity, by assisting the adsorp-
tion of hydrophobic tail of FFAs near and on the catalytic sites
[27,98], thereby leading to a limited deactivation of acid sites
through water produced during the esterification process [89,90].
Resins showing a permanent porous structure seem to deactivate
more easily than gel-type resins [72,85,91], due to their greater
capacity to adsorb the water. A catalyst deactivation effect of metal
ions impurities (e.g., Fe+3) through metal exchange may be observed
on biodiesel production from waste cooking oil, particularly for high
alcohol: FFA molar ratios. Further, non-FFA organic acid impurities
were found to show synergic effects with the sulphonated resins
[89,90]. A few groups [84,90(cid:1)92] also demonstrated the deactiva-
tion effect on resin catalysts of metal ions impurities (e.g., Fe+3)
through metal exchange, particularly for high alcohol: FFA molar
ratios.

PTable 1 resumes the results on cation-exchange sulphonic acid
resins for FFA esterification reactions and Fig. 8 shows their corre-
sponding structures.

3. Resin-based acid catalysts

3.1. Microporous catalysts

PHyper-crosslinked polystyrenes are typically microporous mate-
rials. Extensive crosslinking occurs via Friedel Crafts reaction
between a cross-linker (typically dihalogen methyl hydrocarbons)
and the phenyl rings of the polymer chain. After solvent removal,
permanent microporous structures with high surface areas are
obtained [100]. The commercially available super acidic hyper-
crosslinked resin Purolite C275 was employed by Papayannakos and
co-workers in the esterification of highly acidic vegetable oil
(38 wt% acidity) with methanol [101]. The main resin features were:
acidity of 5.2 eqH+g¡1, BET surface area of 31£10¡3 m2 kg-1 and pore
volume of 0.3 cm3g¡1. Only ca. 1% FFA was left over after reaction at
6.6:1 methanol: acid molar ratio and 100 °C using 2 wt% catalyst.
However, catalytic activity was substantially lost after the first reac-
tion cycle. The sulphonated hyper-crosslinked polystyrene resins
Purolite D5081 and D5082 also have been successfully applied in the
esterification reaction of oleic acid with methanol [102]. Purolite
D5081 exhibited nearly double BET surface area with respect to the
D5082 (700 vs. 380 m2g¡1). On the other hand, the latter contained
more acidic sites (2.0 vs 1.0 mol SO3Hg¡1) and had larger pore vol-
ume (0.4 vs. 0.2 cm3g¡1) and average pore diameter (27 vs. 19 nm).
The reaction conditions were set at 44:1 methanol; acid molar ratio,
5 wt% catalyst and 65 °C. Despite its lower content of acidic sites,
Purolite D5081 exhibited the highest activity, with a turnover fre-
quency number (TOF) of 65 h¡1 vs. 26 h¡1 for D5082. Anyhow, both
hyper-crosslinked resins were demonstrated to be much more
active than macroreticular Amberlyst 15, for which a TOF of 2 h¡1
was observed. The superior performance of Purolite D5081 was

Pexplained on the basis of its high surface area. Particularly, by com-
paring the two hyper-crosslinked resins, the authors hypothesized
that a greater extent of functionalization reduces the available sur-
face area, likely because (solvated) acid groups blocks some of the
network micropores, reducing the accessibility to reactants. How-
ever, the activity of Purolite D5081 was significantly lost after one
reaction cycle. For higher reaction temperatures (85 °C), the catalyst
maintained its activity for four runs. The authors speculated that the
activity loss was caused by the blockage of resin fine pores by large
FFA molecules; at higher temperature the diffusion of FFA through
the resin may likely be faster, thereby preventing such blockage.
The reaction scope of Purolite D5081 and D5082 was broadened by
Saha and co-workers [103], who reported the esterification of used
cooking oil (acid value of 12.2 mgKOHg¡1) with methanol. With
Purolite D5081 FFA 88% conversion was reached whereas with Puro-
lite D5082 only 78% (both at a 6:1 methanol: acid molar ratio and at
65 °C (8 h)) with 1 wt% catalyst. Macroporous Amberlyst 36 was also
tested for comparison. Despite the higher sulfur content in the latter
(18.7% vs. 4.9 and 5.9% for Purolite D5081 and D5082, respectively),
the con version achieved was the lowest (ca. 30%), which highlight
once more the predominant influence of the surface area on the cat-
alyst activity. However, 8(cid:1)10% activity loss per reaction cycle was
observed (in a total of four runs), which was attributed to fouling
phenomena and sulfur leaching.

PIn two subsequent papers, Bhaumik and co-workers reported
novel sulphonated hyper-crosslinked polymers for the synthesis of
biodiesel under mild conditions [104,105]. The authors first reported
the preparation of HMP-1-SO3H (Fig. 9,
left) via Friedel-Crafts
alkylation between a,a'-p-bromoxylene and carbazole over FeCl3,
followed by sulphonation of the resulting polymer with chlorosul-
phonic acid [104]. HMP-1-SO3H exhibited acidity of 3.7 mmolg¡1,
BET surface area of 346 m2g¡1, pore size distribution centered at
1.54 nm and pore volume ca. 0.2 cm3g¡1.

PThe catalyst activity was tested in the esterification of a wide set
of FFAs (lauric, mirystic, palmitic, stearic, oleic, adipic andsebacic
acid), employing a methanol: acid molar ratio of 50:1 or 100:1 and
20 mg of HMP-1-SO3H per mmol FFA at room temperature. In all
cases, excellent conversions between 93 and 99% were achieved
after 10(cid:1)12 h reaction time. Interestingly, the catalytic activity was
retained for four reaction cycles, with catalyst washing/drying in
between runs. Subsequently, the same group developed a new class
of sulphonated pyrene-based hyper-crosslinked microporous cata-
lysts SPPOP-x (Fig. 9, right) via Friedel-Crafts alkylation of pyrene
and bis(1,4-dibromomethyl)benzene in different molar ratios rang-
ing from 2:1(SPPOP-1) to 1:1 (SPPOP-2) to 1:2 (SPPOP-3), in the
presence of FeCl3 catalyst, followed by sulphonation with chlorosul-
phonic acid [105]. These polymers showed a crosslinked nanofiber-
like or spherical morphology, were thermally stable (25% weight
loss at 250 °C for SPPOP-1) and featured high acidity (2.2(cid:1)3.2 mmol
SO3Hg¡1). The BET surface area decreased inversely with the sulpho-
nation degree, i.e., in the order SPPOP-1 (280 m2g¡1 )> SPPOP-2
(244 m2g¡1)>SPPOP-3 (205 m2g¡1). The catalysts activity was tested
for the esterification of various long-chain FFA with methanol. Using
a methanol: acid molar ratio of 50:1 and 0.054 mmol SO3H per
mmol FFA, conversions up to 90% were achieved in all cases after
10 h at room temperature. No substantial activity loss was observed
after six reaction cycles, with catalyst washing/drying in between
runs. Interestingly, SPPOP-3 gave promising results when used in
the transesterification of olive oil (94% conversion). Very recently,
the same group [106] reported different type of microporous cata-
lyst (PVDTA-SO3H), synthesized via sulphonation with chlorosul-
phonic acid of poly-DVB-co-triallyl amine [106]. The SO3H loading
on this material was 2.3 mmol g¡1, with a BET surface area of
410 m2g¡1, randomly arranged micropores with average diameter of
1.4 nm and good thermal stability (4(cid:1)10% weight loss at 200 °C). The
catalytic activity of PVDTA-SO3H for esterification of above

Pmentioned FFAs with methanol was tested under the following con-
ditions: 120:1 methanol: FFA molar ratio, 10 mg catalyst per mmol
FFA, 25 °C. In all cases, conversions in the range of 92(cid:1)98% were
obtained after 12 h reaction time. Interestingly, no significant cata-
lyst activity loss was observed after six reaction cycles.

PTable 2 resumes the results on microporous sulphonic acid resins
for FFA esterification reactions and Fig. 10 shows their correspond-
ing chemical structures.

3.2. Mesoporous catalysts

PThe development of mesoporous solid acids has contributed to
overcome the porosity limitations, since they commonly exhibit suf-
ficient high BET surface area as well as abundant and homogeneous
mesoporosity, leading to good catalytic activities in a wide number
of acid catalyzed reactions with bulky substrates [107]. In (trans)

Pesterification reactions sulphonic acid-functionalized SiO2 and sul-
fated ZrO2 are frequently used. However, in many cases, these inor-
ganic hydrophilic networks result in a lower dispersion in various
organic substrates, which ultimately limits the catalytic activities
[108].

PIn a series of publications [109(cid:1)111], Liu et al. reported the
development of sulphonated mesoporous hydrophobic polydivinyl-
benzenes (PDVBs) for the esterification of FFA with different alcohols
as well as the simultaneous esterification/transesterification of
(highly acidic) oil to FAME. The authors prepared first a series of
PDVB-SO3H by hydrothermal polymerization of DVB followed by
sulphonation with chlorosulphonic acid, each step of the process
occurring under a variety of conditions such as the porogenic sol-
vent, the monomer: porogen ratio and the reaction time. The cata-
lysts presented excellent catalytic activities for the esterification
reaction of lauric acid with ethanol (89(cid:1)99%), using a 20:1 alcohol:

Fig. 10. Chemical structure of various mesoporous sulphonic acid resins.

Pacid molar ratio and a 0.187:1 catalyst: acid mass ratio at 70 °C (5 h).
Notably, these conversions were much higher than those obtained
in the presence of the Amberlyst-15 benchmark (75%), which
was attributed, at least in part, to the higher BET surface area, larger
pore volume and the more hydrophobic nature of the polymer
network. Interestingly, no substantial activity loss was observed
after four reaction cycles, with the catalyst undergoing extensive
regeneration in between runs (i.e., washing/drying/H2SO4 regenera-
tion). PDVB-SO3H-type catalysts also showed good performance
in the transesterification of tripalmitin which contained both FFA
and water impurities. When the reaction was performed at a 60:1
metanol:tripalmitin molar ratio and 0.12:1 catalyst: tripalmitin
mass ratio, conversions up to 76% were achieved at 65 °C. Recyclabil-
ity studies pointed out that the optimal catalyst showed only 5%
activity loss after three reaction cycles.

PMore recently, the same research group successfully prepared a
novel class of hydrophobic mesoporous catalysts (H-PDVB-SO3H) by
solvothermal co-polymerization between DVB and sodium p-styrene
sulphonate, under varying conditions. The reaction between acetic
acid and butanol or cyclohexanol was considered as a model esterifi-
cation reaction (alcohol: acid molar ratio of 1:1.5 or 1:2.6, 0.20 or
0.65 g catalyst per mol acid, 90(cid:1)100 °C). Conversions up to 90% for
1-butanol and 78% for cyclohexanol were obtained, this latter being
lower likely because of the greater alcohol steric hindrance which
limits the access to the acidic sites. The catalytic activity was sub-
stantially retained after five reaction cycles.

PTable 3 resumes the results on mesoporous sulphonic acid resins
for FFA esterification reactions and Fig. 11 shows their correspond-
ing chemical structure.

3.3. Ionic liquid catalysts

PA wide range of SO3H-functionalized ionic liquids (ILs) can poten-
tially replace both conventional homogeneous and heterogeneous
acid catalysts, since they are very effective in many acid-catalyzed
reaction, including (trans)esterification. Indeed, some exhibit activi-
ties comparable to those of homogeneous catalysts such as sulfuric
acid [112(cid:1)114]. Moreover, their structure can be tuned to enhance
their selectivity and recyclability. Despite these advantages, ILs have

Psome drawbacks such as high viscosity, which causes a difficult han-
dling and limits the diffusion processes. Also, their use is not conve-
nient in industrial continuous systems due to their relatively high
cost and potential environmental impact [115]. To overcome these
issues, attempts have been made to immobilize acid ILs on a number
of solid supports [115], including organic polymers such as polysty-
rene (PS) based or PDVB based networks. Guan's group reported the
synthesis of an acidic PS-supported 1-(propyl-3-sulphonate)imida-
zolium hydrosulfate ionic liquid (PS-CH2-[SO3H-pIM][HSO4]) catalyst
through supporting the IL on highly crosslinked chloromethylated
polystyrene [116]. Interestingly, scanning electron microscopy stud-
ies revealed the formation of a compact thin layer of acidic IL on the
surface of polystyrene, originally rough. Also, the catalyst revealed
to be thermally stable up to ca. 300 °C, which was higher than that
for the original support. The catalyst activity was tested in model
esterification reactions,
including acetic acid esterification with
butanol. Using a small excess of butanol over acetic acid (1.2:1 molar
ratio) and 8 wt% catalyst, a conversion of 99% was achieved after 3 h
at 92 °C. No substantial activity loss was observed after 13 reaction
cycles, with catalyst washing/drying in between runs. Xiao and co-
workers developed a series of interesting hydrophobic mesoporous
heterogeneous IL based catalyst, exhibiting high thermal stability
[117]. They were synthesized by solvothermal co-polymerization of
DVB with 1-vinylimidazolate, 4-vinylpyridine or 1-vinyl-2-pyrroly-
done in ethylacetate at 100 °C, and subsequent quaternary ammoni-
zation and anion-exchange treatment. Particularly, PDVB-[C1vim]
[SO3CF3] (C1 = CH3, vim = 1-vinylimidazolate) was found to enable
excellent conversion (97%) for tripalmitin transesterification with
methanol (methanol: tripalmitin molar ratio 90:1, 0.05 g mmol¡1
catalyst,65 °C,16 h). No significant activity loss was observed after
five reaction cycles. Notably, under the same conditions, Amberlyst
15 as a benchmark gave a much lower conversion (29%).

PMore recently, Liang described the preparation of a PDVB co-
polymerized [SO3H(CH2)3VPy]HSO4] poly(ionic)liquid (PIL) and its
use in the biodiesel synthesis from waste fried oil with high FFA con-
tent (22%) [118]. The reaction was carried out using1:0.6 oil: metha-
nol mass ratio, 1 wt% catalyst at 70 °C, yielding 98% FFA conversion
after 12 h reaction time. Recyclability studies were performed; the
authors did not find any substantial activity loss after six reaction

Fig. 11. Chemical structure of mesoporous sulphonic acid resins.

Pcycles. Moreover, the catalyst was easily recoverable by filtration.
The authors attributed the excellent activity/stability of the catalyst
to its hydrophobic surface and the stable porous structure of the
immobilized IL. Yang's group in turn, reported the preparation of a
mesoporous polymeric solid acid synthesized via hydrothermal co-
polymerization of DVB with vinylimidazole, followed by quaternary
ammonization,
ion-exchange and subsequent sulphonation with
chlorosulphonic acid [119]. The resultant catalyst presented acidity
of 2.6 mmol g¡1, large BET surface area (280 m2g¡1), large pore vol-
ume (0.9 cm3g¡1), abundant wormhole-like mesopores (which
improves the contact between the active site and the reactants and
improves diffusion constraints) and good thermal stability up to
226 °C. In the esterification reaction of oleic acid with methanol
under the conditions of 30:1 methanol: acid molar ratio, 5 wt% cata-
lyst and 100 °C (8 h), an excellent conversion of 98% was achieved,
with the catalyst activity substantially retained after four reaction
cycles. Regeneration of the catalyst was required in between runs
(washing/drying/H2SO4).
Interestingly, the catalytic system was
also efficient in the simultaneous esterification/transesterification of
crude Jatropha curcas oil (acid value 15.9 mgKOHg¡1), affording
94% conversion to FAME, under similar reaction conditions, except
for reaction temperature and time (160 °C, 8 h). However, in this
case, ca. 20% activity loss was observed after four cycles due to par-
tial active site detachment.

PA novel approach to heterogeneous IL-based catalyst was intro-
duced by Wu et al. [120]. In their study, a macroporous PIL was
synthesized by free radical polymerization of 1-vinyl-3-(3-sulpho-
propyl)imidazolium hydrogen sulfate [VSIM][HSO4], with Fe3O4
particles acting as a solid template. The easy removal of the template
led to the formation of macropores. The polymer network was multi-
layered and exhibited repeating units of -SO3H and -HSO4. Interest-
ingly, the catalytic system showed excellent activity in the esterifica-
tion reaction of oleic acid with butanol, leading to 93% conversion at
12:1 butanol: acid molar ratio and 110 °C (4 h) with 8.5 wt% catalyst.
The catalyst showed fine separation efficiency from the reaction
mixture and substantially retained its activity after six cycles.

PTable 4 resumes the results obtained with IL immobilized acid
resins for FFA esterification reactions and Fig. 12 shows their corre-
sponding chemical structures.

4. Ionomeric membranes

PFunctional membranes with strong acid groups (so-called iono-
meric membranes) are attracting increasing interest as solid acid
catalysts, since they can prevent equipment corrosion caused by
homogeneous acids and since they can be easily removed from the
reaction mixture and, in principle, be re-utilized. Moreover, they
are easily prepared by polymer blending or hybridization with
other active components. For instance, Castanheiro and co-workers
reported the use of a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) membrane crosslinked
with sulphosuccinic acid (PVA_SSA40) for the esterification of pal-
mitic acid with methanol [121]. PVA_SSA40 swelled in methanol
contained a high amount of acidic sites (4.0 molg¡1) with BET sur-
face area ca. 3 m2g¡1. Using a large excess of methanol (63:1 metha-
nol: acid molar ratio) and 10 wt% catalyst, an equilibrium conversion
of ca. 90% was achieved after 2 h at 60 °C, with a selectivity to
dimethyl ether of 97: 3. Lower conversion (80%) was obtained when

Pusing the corresponding PS based membrane crosslinked with DVB.
The PVA_SSA40 superior behavior was explained on the basis of the
different hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance of the two polymeric
matrices, with the PVA matrix being more hydrophilic due to the
high -OH content (i.e. higher swelling capacity). In the catalyst re-
utilization tests a 17% activity loss was observed after the first cycle.
Then, a stabilization of the activity was observed and no substantial
drop occurred during six reaction cycles. This behavior was attrib-
uted to some leaching of unbound sulphosuccinic acid. Finally, the
scope of the sulphonated membrane was to oleic acid and stearic
acid, leading to a FFA equilibrium conversion close to 80%.

thermal

PZeng's group proposed the esterification of waste cooking oil (ca.
8% FFA content) with methanol in the presence of polystyrene sul-
phonic acid PSSA/PVA membranes, prepared by solution casting and
subsequent
treatment at varying temperatures [122].
Higher temperatures were found to enhance their stability, owing to
the formation of crosslinks among PVA and PSSA chains. Indeed, an
increased retention of PSSA in the blend membrane was observed
with higher annealing temperature. As a general trend, the catalytic
activation of the membrane increased with increasing PVA content
in the blend, which was attributed to (1) increase in the membrane
surface area (at fixed thickness); (2) increase in hydrophilicity,
which improves the absorption of water produced during the pro-
cess, shifting the reaction equilibrium forward. The optimized blend
membrane exhibited a 1:2 PSSA/PVA molar ratio, an ion exchange
capacity of 0.98 meqg¡1 and a fair good thermal stability (21%
weight loss in the 120 ¡250 °C). The activity of the catalytic system
was tested at 1:1 methanol: oil mass ratio and 64 °C, with
0.06 meqg¡1 (oil) of catalyst. A conversion to FAME as high as 90%
was achieved. Recyclability studies evidenced a 10% deactivation
after the first run, then the activity was substantially retained after
three reaction cycles.

PLi and co-workers prepared functional catalytic membranes fea-
turing -SO3H groups by blending polyethersulphone (PES) and sul-
phonated polyethersulphone (SPES) and used it in the esterification
reaction of FFA in waste oil (8 wt%) with methanol [123]. At the opti-
mal conditions of 13.5:1 methanol: oil molar ratio, 0.06 meqg¡1oil of
catalytic membrane (20% degree of sulphonation), and, FFA conver-
sions of 98% were achieved at 65 °C. The recyclability of the SPES/
PES membrane was investigated and after five cycles the original
activity decreased ca. 14%. This was attributed to leaching of -SO3H
groups. As a continuation on the previous work, the same group
modified the membrane by blending PES and SPES with polyethyl-
ene terephthalate non-woven fabrics [124]. The optimized compos-
ite SPES/PES/NWF featured an acid capacity of 15.8 mmolH+g¡1,
8.61 mm thickness and 68% porosity. It was used for the oleic acid
esterification with methanol in a flow through catalytic membrane

Preactor. At the optimal feed flow rate of 1.2 mL min¡1 (3:1 methanol:
oil mass ratio), an oleic acid conversion over 98% was obtained for
500 h on stream.

PZhao's group developed a series of catalytic membranes consist-
ing of cation-exchange resin particles (CERP) and PES, prepared via
immersion phase inversion. The optimized CERP/PES membrane
(IEC 1.89 meqH+g¡1) was used for the esterification of acidified oil
(FFAs content 8%) with methanol, ethanol, propanol and butanol
[125,126]. The best results were those obtained with butanol (buta-
nol: waste oil molar ratio 29:1) in the presence of 0.17 meq catalytic
membrane g¡1 acidified oil at 120 °C. After 8 h reaction time, a FFAs
conversion of 95% was achieved. Despite the lowest swelling degree
of the catalytic membrane in butanol, better results were obtained
as butanol was more miscible with FFAs, compared to the shorter
chain alcohols.

PTable 5 resumes the results obtained with ionomeric membranes
for FFA esterification reactions and Fig. 13 shows the corresponding
chemical structure.

5. Miscellaneous

PA novel sulphonated polyethersulphone PES-H was prepared by
Zhang et al., using direct co-polymerization of the sulphonic mono-
mer bis(4-chloro-3-sulphophenyl) sulphone disodium salt with
(4-chlorophenyl)sulphone and 4,40-biphenol [127]. The polymer
chains contained electron withdrawing SO2- groups, which confers
improved acid strength and thermal stability (decomposition of sul-
phonic groups started at 274 °C) compared to the Amberlyst 15
benchmark. The polymeric catalyst showed high activity in the
esterification reaction of lauric acid with ethanol, with 96% FFA
conversion at 6:1 ethanol; acid molar ratio, 2:1 wt/mol catalyst and
65 °C (5 h). To better compare the efficiency of PES-H vs. Amberlyst
15, having a higher content of acidic sites (2.4 mmolH+g¡1 for PES-H
vs. 5.0 mmolH+g¡1 for Amberlyst 15), the authors calculated the
activity per catalytic active center (i.e., specific activity) and found a
value 2.2 times higher for PES-H. After a four-time re-use,
14%catalyst activity loss was observed, which was attributed to a
decrease in acidic sites concentration. Correspondently, no substan-
tial activity loss over four reactions was observed when catalyst
regeneration was performed in between cycles. More recently, Ma
and co-workers prepared PES porous nanofibers through electro-
spinning, on which perfluorinated sulphonic acid (PFSA) resin was
anchored by dip-coating followed by heat treatment [128]. The
resulting material (CM3) exhibited a macroporous structure result-
ing from the disordered accumulation of mesoporous nanofibers
(41 m2g¡1). The catalytic activity was tested in the model esterifica-
tion reaction of acetic acid with ethanol at 80 °C (ethanol: acid molar

Pratio 3:1 and 5 wt% catalyst). After 1 h reaction time, conversion
reached already 90%. Further, a 94% mass recovery by filtration
after three reaction cycles was achieved, with stable ion exchange
capacity.

PLee and co-workers have synthesized sulphonic group functional
macroporous phenol-formaldehyde resins (PSF) featuring a botryoi-
dal structure [129,130]. The activity of these resins was evaluated in
the esterification reaction of oleic acid with different alcohols. By
employing 1.4 mol% of catalyst, conversions in the range of 97(cid:1)99%
(96(cid:1)97% yield) were obtained after 6 h at 90 °C. No substantial activ-
ity loss was observed after 30 reaction cycles, with the catalyst being
subjected to extensive regeneration in between runs. On the other
hand, close to 30% activity loss was observed after the first run by
omitting the catalyst regeneration protocol. Bae's group developed a
polystyrene-supported superacidic fluoroalkyl sulphonic acid cata-
lyst (sPS-S) via iridium-catalyzed borylation of the C(cid:1)(cid:1)H bonds of
aromatic rings of (syndiotactic) polystyrene and subsequent Suzuki
cross-coupling reaction with fluoroalkylsulphonated phenylbromide
[129,130]. Although not featuring a porous structure, it was possible
to grind the catalyst into fine particles, affording a BET surface area
of 0.1 m2g¡1, which is five times higher than that for the Nafion
NR50 benchmark. The presence of the strong electron-withdrawing
fluoroalkyl group enabled an (estimated) pKa of ¡14. The authors
pointed out that sPS-S exhibited an acid content which was nearly
doubled that for Nafion NR50 (1.67 mmol/g vs 0.90 mmol/g). The cat-
alytic efficiency of sPS-S was explored in the esterification reaction
of lauric acid with methanol, under the conditions of 16:1 methanol:
acid molar ratio, 0.5 wt% catalyst, 65 °C. A complete conversion of
lauric acid into the corresponding ester was obtained after 10 h reac-
tion time. Similar results were obtained for the esterification of FA
bearing different chain length (i.e., C12, C14, C16 and C18). Interest-
ingly, recyclability studies showed very good catalyst mass recovery
(1(cid:1)5 wt% loss after each cycle), and no substantial activity loss was
observed after ten reaction cycles, the catalyst being washed/dried
in between runs. Finally, the catalytic activity was also tested in the
transesterification of trilaurin with methanol, affording 98% conver-
sion in methyl laurate after 22 h (200 eq. methanol, 5 mol% catalyst).
Liu et al. [131] employed an aminophosphonic acid resin immobi-
lized on a PS backbone (D418) for the microwave-assisted esterifica-
tion of stearic acid with ethanol. FAME conversion up to 90% were
obtained after 7 h at 80 °C (9 wt% catalyst and 11:1 alcohol: acid
molar ratio). A slower reaction and a somewhat lower conversion of
88% were achieved by conventional heating. The microwave radia-
tion exerted a synergic effect with the catalyst, by exciting the polar
reactants in the solution phase. The resin was structurally stable as
determined by XRD, TGA and SEM, retaining 87% conversion after
five reaction cycles.

PRecently, Aguilar-Guarnica et al. explored the possibility of using
waste polymers as acid catalyst supports for biodiesel production
[132]. Thus, the authors performed the sulphonation of poly(sty-
rene-co-butadiene) waste collected from disposable cups, to afford a
catalytic system featuring acidity of 5.1 meqH+g¡1, methanol and
water adsorption capacity of 1.7 and 7.2 gg¡1, respectively. The cata-
lyst was tested for the esterification of FFAs (59 wt%) contained in a
mixture of tallow fat and canola oil with methanol. At 40:1 metha-
nol: FFA molar ratio and 0.12:1 catalyst: FFA mass ratio, conversions

Pup to 91% were achieved after 1 h at 60 °C. For comparison, reaction
in the presence of H2SO4 (5 wt% based on total FFA weight) gave a
comparable conversion of 99%. Goodwin Jr.'s group investigated the
esterification reaction of a variety of carboxylic acids featuring dif-
ferent chain lengths (acetic, propionic, butyric, hexanoic, and cap-
in the presence of Nafion SAC-13
rylic acid) with methanol
[133,134]. Nafion SAC-13 is a composite material comprising Nafion
and porous silica, with high BET surface area (196 m2g¡1) and strong
acidity. At 2:1 methanol: acid molar ratio, 2.5 wt% catalyst and 60 °C,
a TOF value of 438 h¡1was observed with acetic acid. The reaction
rate increased as the number of carbons in the carboxylic acid alkyl
chain decreases (less steric hindrance and hydrophobicity). The
authors also found that the alkyl chain length affected catalyst deac-
tivation by water as well as its recoverability and re-usability, as
well as the mass recovery from the polymer and catalyst surface
inside the pores. Indeed, using THF washing, Nafion SAC-13 exhib-
ited decent reusability in esterification of short chain acids, whereas
it underwent a continuous activity loss in consecutive runs involving
the long-chain counterparts. A hybrid catalytic membrane was pre-
pared by Shi et al. from sulphonated PVA loaded with solid acid cata-
lyst Zr(SO4)2 in a 1:1 ratio, which gave 95% conversion for the
esterification of FFA in acidified oil with methanol [135]. The cata-
lytic system revealed a good stability, with only 8 % activity loss after
five consecutive reaction cycles.

(HNs)

PRecently, hollow nanospheres

solid catalysts have
attracted attention because of the impact of this morphology on the
diffusion length of reactants and product, which clearly improved
the reaction rate as well as selectivity, by decreasing the possibility
for side reactions. In this context, Zhang et al. reported the fabrica-
tion of hybrid solid acids with a double-shell nanostructure (DSNs)
via polystyrene sulphonic acid (PS-SO3H) self-assembly driven
by H-bond interaction in the confined nanospace of silica HNs,
denominated PS-SO3H@mesosilicas DSNs [136]. The fabrication pro-
cess involved the preparation PS@mesosilicas with yolk-shell nano-
structures (YSNs) by organosilane assisted etching using1,2-bis-
(trimethoxysilyl)ethane as precursor (Fig. 14). A structural surface
modification by octyl groups through grafting was introduced for-
tuning the hydrophobicity. PS-SO3H@mesosilicas DSNs featured
higher BET surface area (412 m2g¡1) and larger pore volume
(0.42 cm3g¡1) than the Amberlyst 15 benchmark. Interestingly, it
was found that the acid strength of PS-SO3H@mesosilicas DSNs
could be balanced,
through restoring and destroying H-bond
interactions by treatment in aprotic polar solvents and acids.
PS-SO3H@mesosilicas DSNs with enhanced acid strength exhibited

Plargely motivated by the fact that levulinates are structurally quite
like the biodiesel FAME (Scheme 1). Additionally, they feature better
oxidative stability, cold flow properties, as well as less tendency to
form undesirable gums, and therefore, the addition of alkyl levuli-
nates to biodiesel is expected to address these issues [45,46]. Also,
the family of levulinates help to achieve cleaner burning fuel. It is
worth mentioning here that ethyl levulinate can be used as a bio-
additive in diesel fuel up to 5 wt.%. Finally, technological initiatives
are being taken to use levulinates as neat diesel-type alternative fuel
in the next future [46,50].

PLevulinate esters can be obtained in good yields following differ-
ent routes [45]. One of the most straightforward is the direct esterifi-
cation reaction of the short-chain FA levulinic acid (LA) (cid:1) one of the
platform molecules that can be accessed starting from lignocellu-
losic biomass (cid:1) with alcohols, catalyzed by homogeneous acid cata-
lysts, e.g. sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid (Scheme 1). A variety of
heterogeneous acid catalysts have been used more recently (mostly
for esterification with ethanol), including supported heteropolya-
cids, zeolites, hybrid catalysts, carbon-based materials functional-
ized with sulphonic groups, sulfated metal oxides and silicas
[138(cid:1)146].

PYet, only sporadic attempts were undertaken to use resin-
supported acid catalysts. Teixeira da Silva and co-workers tested
Amberlyst 15 ion exchanger for the esterification reaction of LA
with ethanol. Wihan ethanol: levulinic acid molar ratio of 5:1,
2.5 wt% catalyst, a conversion of 55% was achieved after 5 h at
70 °C [147]. After four reaction cycles the catalyst activity was sub-
stantially maintained, with the catalyst being subjected to washing/
drying in between runs. Under identical reaction conditions, except
for the catalyst amount (0.8 mol%), Melero et al. obtained only 5%
conversion after 3 h reaction time [148]. Similar results were
obtained with Nafion NR 50 (8% conversion). Amberlyst 15 and
Nafion NR 50 were also tested by Maggi et al, along with a fluori-
nated Nafion NR 50 congener (Aquivion(cid:1)) for the esterification of
LA with pentanol [149]. Remarkably, a stoichiometric amount of
alcohol was used; with the Aquivion(cid:1) leading to the highest con-
version and yield (84% and 80%, respectively), using 1 mol% catalyst
at 100 °C (2 h). Macroreticular Amberlyst 15 gave a conversion and
yield of 52% and 31%, which illustrates that fluorinated catalysts
were much more selective toward pentyl levulinate than Amberlyst
15 (94% vs. 60%, respectively).

PVery recently Tejero et al. efficiently demonstrated the potential
of a range of acidic ion-exchange resins in promoting the esterifica-
tion of LA with 1-butanol, yielding 64(cid:1)94% butyl levulinate [150].
All the experiments were performed with butanol: acid 3:1 molar
ratio and 0.8% catalyst at 80 °C and 2.5 MPa. As a general trend, con-
version (gel-type resins with low crosslinking degree (e.g., Dowex
50Wx2, Dowex 50Wx4 and Purolite CT224) provided higher conver-
sion (up to 94%) than macroreticular ones (e.g., Amberlyst 15, 16, 35
and 46). These findings highlighted that a good swelling capacity in
butanol is essential. Within the gel-type series, over sulphonated
Purolite CT224 was less active than conventionally sulphonated
Dowex 50Wx2, the crosslinking degree being constant (4%). This
was attributed to the possible additional stiffness conferred to the
resin morphology by the over sulphonation, which reduces swelling.
The lowest activity was that of macroreticular Amberlyst 46 (20%
crosslinking degree), which is surface sulphonated and therefore
with only a low number of active sites. Still, LA conversion in the
presence of Amberlyst 46 was only 9% lower than conventionally
sulphonated Amberlyst 15 and 16 (20 and 12% crosslinking degree,
respectively) and Amberlyst 35 (20% crosslinking degree). On this
basis, the authors speculated that when the crosslinking degree is
(cid:2)12%, the swelling is so poor that the reaction likely takes place
quasi on surface active sites exclusively.

PMost recently [151], some of the authors of this contribution
reported a study focusing on the development of a sustainable

phonated PS. Reproduced with permission [137]. Copyright 2014, Royal Society of
Chemistry.

Pexcellent catalytic activity/selectivity in the esterification of lauric
acid. Particularly, under the conditions of 5:1 ethanol: acid molar
ratio, 1:50 catalyst: acid molar ratio and 85 °C, 90% conversion was
achieved after 6 h (TOF 28.6 h¡1). Recyclability studies evidenced
that the solid catalyst could be easily recovered by centrifugation,
and no significant activity loss for eight reaction cycles was reported,
with catalyst being washed/dried in between runs. In a subsequent
paper [137], the same group reported the synthesis of hybrid hollow
nanospheres featuring PS-SO3H aligned uniformly in the mesopo-
rous channel of a silica shell. In this case, the fabrication process
involved the sulphonation of silica HNs, which were prepared by dis-
persing PS in the mesoporous shell synthesized by co-condensation
of a mixture of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and alkoxysilyl-functional-
ized polymethylacrylate (PMA) around PS nanospheres in a base
medium using a mesostructure directing agent followed by THF
treatment (Fig. 15). The resulting catalysts PS/nPMA-SiO2 HNs fea-
tured high BET surface area (120(cid:1)330 m2g¡1) and pore size
(2.5(cid:1)6.4 nm), depending on the polymer content (33(cid:1)72 wt%) incor-
porated in the silica shell. Acid exchange capacity was in the range of
0.8 to 2.0 mmolg¡1. PS/nPMA-SiO2 materials efficiently catalyzed the
lauric acid esterification with ethanol (88(cid:1)95% conversion), compa-
rable to that achieved in the presence of homogeneous H2SO4 (94%)
and much higher than that for the Amberlyst-15 benchmark catalyst
(65%). Moreover, the TOF of the optimized hybrid catalyst was very
close to that of H2SO4 (27.3 and 29.3 h¡1, respectively). The authors
attributed the high activity mainly to the uniform distribution of PS-
SO3H in the silica shell, which facilitates the approach of reactants to
the acidic groups, as well as the fast diffusion of the reactants and
products through the mesoporous shell during the process. How-
ever, for catalytic systems with unmodified surface, the conversion
decreased with about 50% after ten reaction cycles, owing to the
leaching of catalyst active sites. In turn, when octyl groups are pres-
ent, after ten cycles the catalyst could retain 82% of its original activ-
ity. These findings suggested that the hydrophobic octyl group were
able to prevent leaching of active sites likely by tangling with the
PS-SO3H chains during the process.

catalysts for FFA esterification reactions and Fig. 16 shows the corre-

Fig. 16. Chemical structure of various porous (hybrid) polymer based acid catalysts.

three members of

Papproach to structurally diverse alkyl levulinates from LA by using
sulfonated cation exchange resins in the batch mode and under flow
conditions. Specifically,
this heterogeneous
catalyst series exhibiting different morphologies were chosen, i.e.,
macroreticular Amberlyst 15, macroporous polystyrene-supported
p-toluensulfonic acid (PS-pTsOH), and non-porous Aquivion(cid:1) in the
form of micronized pellets (Aquivion mP98, average particle size
»0.7 mm). The results demonstrated that all three catalysts were
active in the model esterification reaction of LA with 1-pentanol and
that, in general, the activity trend was established as follows: Aqui-
vion mP98>PS-pTsOH >Amberlyst 15. This latter finding was tenta-
tively explained based on the porous structure of Amberlyst 15 and
the low-to-non-porous structure of PS-pTsOH and Aquivion mP98,
respectively. In other words, the increase of the surface area due to
the presence of permanent pores appeared to inhibit the process
under the investigated conditions, which matches the trend of the
results obtained by e.g., Park [72,85], Hoelderich [91] and Hidaka
[92] (vide supra) for the esterification of long-chain FFAs. Thus, Aqui-
vion mP98 (10 mol%) gave selectively the highest LA conversion
(92%, 88% isolated yield) under conventional batch conditions,
and the protocol encompassed the nearly complete recovery of

Fig. 17. Chemical structure of Aquivion(cid:1).

Punreacted 1-pentanol by distillation, for subsequent reuse. On the
other hand, maximum conversion of 83% and 76% were achieved for
PS-pTsOH and Amberlyst 15, respectively. The protocol could be suc-
cessfully extended to a panel of short-, moderate-, and branched-
chain aliphatic alcohols. No substantial loss of activity was observed
for all three systems after five reaction cycles, with catalysts wash-
ing/drying in between runs. However, non-porous Aquivion mP98
only was fully recoverable in weight (»5% total loss), thereby reveal-
ing its superior mechanical strength. Importantly, the use of flow
technology proved to be a very efficient solution to maintain the cat-
alysts physical integrity, thereby enhancing their reusability. Addi-
tionally, it helped in enlarging the scale of the batch protocol, by
enabling the production of levulinates in the range of »1 (Amberlyst
15; TOF 0.88 h¡1) to »5 (PS-pTsOH and Aquivion mP96; TOF: 4.30
and 4.68 h¡1, respectively) grams per hour scale.

PTable 7 resumes the results obtained with resin based acid cata-
lysts for levulinic acid esterification and Fig. 17 shows the chemical
structure of the fluorinated resin Aquivion(cid:1).

7. Summary and outlook

PThis work reviews the use of resin-supported strong solid acids
as replacements for traditional catalysts in the efficient overall pro-
duction of biodiesel from biomass feedstocks with high free fatty
acids (FFAs) content. Recent progress in this field has been proved
the technical viability as well as the sustainability of this approach.
Sulfonic ionic exchangers are the most widely investigated members
of the series, though an ever-increasing number of studies focuses
on sulfonic micro- and mesoporous materials, acidic ionic liquids,
ionomeric membranes, and organic-inorganic hybrids. Most of these
resin-supported solid acids showed a promising reactivity toward
esterification of FFAs. On the opposite, the (very limited) amount of
data available with respect to their reactivity toward transesterifica-
tion reactions, indicates that this latter is still unsatisfactory, espe-
cially in view of industrial applications.

PSome limited trends can be identified, though there is often a
conflict among the experimental results, and it is hard at this stage
to identify the resin catalysts appropriate to the biodiesel produc-
tion. Large surface area, large pore volume as well as pore diameter
may be effective in promoting the esterification reaction, though
the catalysts activity may be mainly influenced by its swelling
capacity (cid:1) inversely related to the cross-linking degree (cid:1) at high
alcohol-to-FFAs ratio. Hydrophobic surfaces may promote the
adsorption of hydrophobic FFAs on the solid acid surface, thereby
limiting the deactivation of acid sites by adsorption of water pro-
duced during the esterification process. Resins showing a permanent
porous structure (e.g., Amberlyst 15 benchmark) seem to deactivate
more easily than gel-type resins, owing to their greater capacity to
adsorb the water. A catalyst deactivation effect of metal ions impuri-
ties (e.g., Fe+3) through metal exchange may be observed on biodie-
sel production from waste cooking oil, particularly for high alcohol:
FFA molar ratios.

PThe ultimate scope of this review is to stimulate a discussion
across the scientific community for the need of further research in
the direction of designing robust and stable organic polymer-based
solid acid catalysts that can improve the overall efficiency of valu-
able fuel esters production dramatically. This is still an important

Pchallenge, and a number of factors need to be considered, to ensure
the prominence of such systems on an industrial scale. Particularly,
it is necessary to tune the textural properties of the catalysts (e.g.,
surface hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity balance) to overcome diffu-
sional limitations, as well as catalyst deactivation by polar com-
pounds such as water, glycerol (if transesterification is carried out)
or other contaminants. The design of microstructures featuring an
excellent porosity in terms of homogeneous distribution of pores,
high surface area as well as proper pore diameters are also very
likely to contribute in tackling diffusion limitations. Catalyst stability
is also an issue to be carefully addressed, e.g., by designing the struc-
ture in such a way that the interaction between the polymer net-
work and the acidic sites is strong, to prevent the leaching of active
sites during the reaction process and to ensure at the same time its
resistance at high temperatures.

PThe matter of the comprehensive effect of impurities, including
their co-effects on catalytic activity of cation exchange resins
undoubtedly requires, in turn, to be further clarified to help a wider
application of resin-based catalysts in the biodiesel production
industry.

PBesides, it is worth mentioning here that sulfonated resins can be
conveniently functionalized with metals to afford bifunctional cata-
lysts, which is relevant for hydrodeoxygenation of biomass to access
directly alkane fuels [18,152]. Finally, it is also important to bear in
mind that cumbersome multistep protocols for catalyst preparation
should be avoided, to effectively reduce biofuel production costs.
