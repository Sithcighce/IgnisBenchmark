Thermal energy storage (TES) transfers heat to storage media during the charging period, and releases
it at a later stage during the discharging step. It can be usefully applied in solar plants, or in industrial
processes, such as metallurgical transformations. Sensible, latent and thermo-chemical media store heat
in materials which change temperature, phase or chemical composition, respectively. Sensible heat storage
is well-documented. Latent heat storage, using phase change materials (PCMs), mainly using liquid–
solid transition to store latent heat, allows a more compact, efficient and therefore economical system
to operate. Thermo-chemical heat storage (TCS) is still at an early stage of laboratory and pilot research
despite its attractive application for long term energy storage.

The present review will assess previous research, while also adding novel treatments of the subject.
TES systems are of growing importance within the energy awareness: TES can reduce the LCOE (levelized
cost of electricity) of renewable energy processes, with the temperature of the storage medium being
the most important parameter. Sensible heat storage is well-documented in literature and applied at large
scale, hence limited in the content of the present review paper. Latent heat storage using PCMs is dealt
with, specifically towards high temperature applications, where inorganic substances offer a high po-
tential. Finally, the use of energy storage through reversible chemical reactions (thermo-chemical storage,
TCS) is assessed. Since PCM and TCS storage media need to be contained in a capsule (sphere, tube, sand-
wich plates) of appropriate materials, potential containment materials are examined. A heat transfer fluid
(HTF) is required to convey the heat from capture, to storage and ultimate re-use. Particle suspensions
offer a valid alternative to common HTF, and a preliminary assessment confirms the advantages of the
upflow bubbling fluidized bed and demonstrates that particulate suspensions enable major savings in
investment and operating costs.

Novel treatments of the TES subject in the review involve the required encapsulation of the latent
and chemical storage media, the novel development of powder circulation loops as heat transfer media,
the conductivity enhancement of PCMs, the use of lithium salts, among others.

1. Introduction

1.1. Global energy and the required CO2 reduction

Energy supply is a vital issue, with special concerns of the public
regarding the emission of greenhouse gases and the need to reduce
the use of fossil fuels [1]. The worldwide economic crisis since 2008
added additional challenges [2], leading worldwide governments
to enact new policies and financial incentives in support of renew-
able energies, enhancing their implementation and development,
while simultaneously creating valuable new business opportuni-
ties for companies involved in this energy sector [3,4]. One of the
hot topics in the energy strategy is the capture and storage of thermal
energy as applicable to renewable energy concepts and in waste heat
recovery: these advanced energy utilization schemes call for the de-
velopment and new usage of existing and/or new materials. Based
upon the current statistics and predictions of energy consump-
tion, the U.S. Energy Information Administration predicated an
increase in the total world energy use from 0.15 × 1012 MWh in 2008
to 0.18 × 1012 MWh in 2020, and to 0.23 × 1012 MWh in 2035 [5]. Since
crude oil fuels remain an important source of energy, albeit with
depleting traditional reserves but with significant current fracking
operations, their prices are expected to remain around 60 US$/
barrel for the near future, while 20–40 US$/barrel were valid from
1985 till 2005, but prices of 120–140 US$/barrel are predicted from
2020 onward [5,6].

Because of the use of fossil fuels, current global CO2 emissions
are at 30.6 × 109 tpa of CO2 (against 28.2 × 109 tpa in 2005). Without
effective measures, it is however expected that world energy-
related emissions of CO2 will further increase to 33.5 × 109 tpa in
2015 and 43.2 × 109 tpa in 2035 [5].

The imposed reduction in CO2 emissions will require a combi-
nation of detailed strategies and tactics, including (i) a mix of energy
generation technologies; (ii) a reduction in energy usage through
the use of incentives, technologies, taxes and quotas; (iii) maxi-
mizing CO2 absorption, through carbon sequestration by both natural
means and by technical developments; and (iv) the development
of highly-efficient energy capture, storage and re-use methods [3,7].
There is indeed still a considerable scope for improving the energy
efficiency. In the short or medium term, waste heat recovery and
high temperature thermal energy storage are crucial concepts to im-
plement such solutions, and even current power plants can use high
temperature thermal energy storage to improve the energy balance
of their operations, since they increase the flexibility and availabil-
ity of heat and electricity in traditional or sustainable power plants.
The re-use “of low grade heat”, typically between ambient tem-
perature and 200 °C, is not widespread since it is a technical and
economic challenge to obtain useful exergy and energy from low
grade heat. A large amount of low grade heat is available in the
process industry, e.g. water from cooling towers with exhaust gas
temperatures between 35 °C and 55 °C, and stack exhausts with a
broader temperature range, between 30 °C and ~180 °C [8,9]. Highly

efficient heat exchangers or heat pumps might help in recycling this
low-grade heat. The barriers associated with low grade heat utili-
zation [7] include (i) the need to match the sources with potential
end-users around the process plant; (ii) the difficulty in harness-
ing the potential of the waste water streams available at lower
temperatures (between 35 and 55 °C), while achieving economic
benefits; (iii) the economic and geographic limits towards dis-
tances of pumping recovered heat (steam or hot water); (iv) the heat
losses; and (v) the total cost for pipeline installation and pumping
cost.

In “high grade heat” applications, electricity generation and solar
energy are the key topics. We need energy – electrical or thermal
– but in most cases where and when it is not available. Energy
storage technologies are a strategic and necessary component for
the efficient utilization of renewable energy sources and energy con-
servation, since the addition of short and long term energy storage
will enable an extensive and more efficient use of the fluctuating
renewable energy sources by matching the energy supply with
demand [9]. “High grade waste heat” is already commonly re-
used in chemical and mineral processes such as using the hot exhaust
gas of cement kilns to preheat the raw clinker meal, or through steam
generation in chemical reactors, such as FCC cracking regenera-
tors, production of acrylonitrile, and other synthesis reactions.

Low cost, fossil fuel-based electricity has always served as a major
cost competitor for electrical power generation and traditional power
plants store their energy resource on site in the form of a stock of
e.g. coal, oil, nuclear fuel or even water behind a dam. The alter-
nating current electricity grid requires that supply and demand is
always strictly matched, and electricity network and transmission
system operators have arrangements in place to ensure that this re-
quirement is always met. The traditional electricity market is
therefore largely based on fuels sold and traded as commodities,
and used to generate electricity to instantaneously match supply
with demand. A future electricity system predominantly or solely
supplied by renewable energy sources will therefore find it diffi-
cult to meet the fundamental stability requirement of alternating
current networks to constantly match supply and demand unless
storage facilities are integrated to balance both [9].

1.2. Maturity of different energy storage systems and cost effects

The LCOE is calculated as the system’s expected lifetime costs
(including construction, financing, fuel, maintenance, taxes, insur-
ance and incentives), divided by the system’s lifetime expected power
output (kWh). All cost and benefit estimates are adjusted for in-
flation and discounted to account for the time-value of money. The
LCOE is very useful to compare various generation options, and a
relatively low LCOE means that electricity is produced at a low cost,
with higher returns for the investor.

For a conventional plant, the effects of inflation on future plant
maintenance must be considered and the price of fuel for the plant
lifetime into the future needs to be estimated. A renewable energy
plant is initially more expensive to build, but has very low main-
tenance costs, and no fuel cost over its 20–30 year life. The cost
structure of solar power plants will vary depending on the tech-
nology they use. Fig. 1 shows the capital cost structures for solar
power tower and parabolic trough collector, respectively. Clearly,
major cost items are the solar field and the receiver, together with
the TES component and the power block. To reduce the capital cost
and associated LCOE, these are the major items to be considered.
Both improved TES-systems (reduction of the storage volume) and
an increased operation temperature of the HTF (reduction of solar

receiver capacity, heliostat field size and storage volumes) will enable
this reduction to be achieved. Novel HTF systems using powders and
latent/thermo-chemical TES will be important in this respect, and
are subsequently dealt with in the paper. LCOE estimates for con-
ventional sources of power depend on very volatile fuel cost
estimates, as shown in Fig. 2. These uncertainties must be fac-
tored into LCOE comparisons between different technologies. LCOE
estimates may or may not include the environmental costs and/or
benefits associated with energy production. Governments have
worldwide begun to quantify these costs.

Fig. 2 shows some LCOEs for different renewable energies and
for different MWel produced. The shaded area between both hori-
zontal lines at 0.05 and 0.14 $/kWh indicates the range for electricity
generation based upon fossil fuel. In general the LCOE decreases
when more MW is produced and over the years, due mostly to tech-
nology improvements. This decrease in LCOE with time is very clear
for wind energy, for solar PV and for CSP (concentrated solar power).
Since the energy storage part of the CSP represents 9–18% of the
required investment in PTC or SPT, respectively, reductions in TES
costs will favourably impact the LCOE.

In order to achieve the European climate energy objectives as
defined in the European Union’s “20–20–20” targets and in the Eu-
ropean Commission’s Energy Roadmap 2050, energy storage
technologies are necessary. The energy objectives contain impor-
tant assumptions on long term views for the energy policy based
on different energy mix assumptions. The text moreover does not
claim to determine the future.

The percentage of renewable energy sources in the gross final
energy consumption should attain at least 55% in 2050, and this in
all scenarios of the Roadmap. This shift towards renewable energy
sources will surely lead to a situation in which, from time to time,
generation will considerably exceed demand or vice versa, with ex-
plicit concern to transmission and distribution networks. To respond
to this challenge and to provide a continued security of energy supply
at any time, energy storage is notably well suited. This is why the
crucial role of energy storage technologies for an increasingly de-
carbonized European energy system is recognized by the European
Commission Energy Roadmap 2050. A growing use of renewable
energy sources, especially considering e.g. wind and photovoltaic
(PV) generation, will boost the demand for flexibility in the energy
system.

Energy storage is indeed very appropriate to respond to this chal-
lenge and to assure a continued security of energy supply at any
time.

As mentioned before, there are four main goals met by energy

storage.

Firstly, energy storage will ensure the balance between demand
and supply, especially in view of the expanding variability at the
generation side. Since energy storage allows a timely and geograph-
ical displacement between consumption and generation sites, it
promotes the integration of renewable energy sources generation.
Secondly, it is possible to manage transmission and distribu-
tion grids with energy storage, confirmed to become a fundamental
element of the future electricity infrastructure to stabilize the grid,
even with ideal expansion of transmission capacities. Moreover, some
storage technologies could be realized much faster than grid up-
grades. With the current trend of electricity production and
consumption being decentralized and fluctuating, storage can be
used to improve generation, transportation and distribution: energy
storage will allow to size grids closer to average energy flows instead
of peak power requirements, whilst also resulting in reduced trans-
mission losses, and improving the stability and reliability of grids
with the use of storage.

Thirdly, energy storage technologies will have a major role in the
transition to a more efficient and sustainable energy use. This will
be mainly seen in the transportation sector with the use of (hybrid)
electric vehicles, but also in the emergence of intelligent build-
ings and smart grids. With energy storage, it is also possible to
manage electricity/heat generation and consumption on a local level,
in an optimal way for the whole power system.

Finally, energy storage will also contribute to a competitive and
secure electricity supply. Since energy storage can provide an eco-
nomically interesting alternative to grid expansion and load shedding,
it will be very important in new market designs. Market mecha-

nisms for flexibility and security of supply and specific storage
regulation will help to establish a competitive energy storage market.
Within the different types of energy storage such as electrical,
thermal, mechanical, electrochemical and chemical storage, the tech-
nologies recommended by the European Association for Storage of
Energy (EASE) are listed in Table 1 with their actual state-of-the-
art repartition: thermal, electrochemical and chemical energy storage
seem most suitable or possible in different technology sections.

Sensible heat storage is one of the most developed technolo-
gies for thermal storage and has been used for many years in both
the domestic and the industrial sector, e.g. in the form of hot water
and ice storage systems, or using thermal fluid or molten salts in
concentrated solar tower technology. Sensible heat storage is indeed
most commonly used for CSP plants using a two-tank storage of
molten salts. For low temperature applications (<40 °C), under-
ground thermal energy storage is recently gaining popularity in the
European markets. For high temperature applications very few ex-
amples are currently used in the process industry, despite numerous
publications and research.

Latent heat storage, using PCMs, is in full development. By 2015,
the specific investment costs of latent heat storage, storage of in-
dustrial waste heat, and improved thermal management need to
be reduced below 100 €/kWh. By 2020 the specific investment cost
for compact latent heat storage should be below 50 €/kWh. Towards
2030 the intention is to have industrial process heat applications
with thermal energy storage [12].

Thermal–chemical energy storage applies both thermal and
chemical storages, using the sensible heat of reactants and the re-
action enthalpy of reversible thermo-chemical reactions. According
to EASE [12], the niche applications for thermo-chemical storage

still need to be identified. By 2020, the goal is to have a specific in-
vestment cost for thermo-chemical storage below 50 €/kWh. Towards
2030 the intention is to have thermo-chemical storage tanks for solar
thermal power plants and industrial process heat applications. To
take advantage of the high energy storage density, the operating tem-
perature should exceed 400 °C [12].

1.3. Energy storage in general, and thermal energy storage
specifically

Energy storage, as suggested by its name, is to store a certain
form of energy, which can thus be used later when necessary: the
storage device is generally called an accumulator. Various forms of
energy, commonly including kinetic energy, potential energy (gravi-
tational), chemical energy, electrical energy or thermal energy, can
be stored by using appropriate methods, as illustrated in Fig. 3.

The different systems can be tentatively assessed in view of
energy density and prices per unit energy-stored, as illustrated in
Table 2.

High temperature thermal energy storage is the main objective
of this paper, although cryogenics and moderate temperature storage
will also be briefly dealt with.

TES works by heating storage media during a charging period
and then releasing the heat when the energy is needed [14], thus
increasing the energy efficiency of a system and being commonly
used to compensate the mismatch between energy supply and
demand [15]. Current applications include thermal building pro-
cesses [16]; solar applications such as cooking, solar water boilers,
air heating systems, greenhouses and concentrated solar power
plants [17–21]; mining and metallurgy [22,23]; and solar tower
power plants [3,17].

1.4. Heat balances in thermal energy storage

Sensible heat storage (SHS) stores thermal energy by raising the
temperature of a solid or liquid without the occurrence of a phase
change. The following equation expresses the SHS potential:

where m is the mass of storage material, Cp is specific heat at con-
stant pressure of the SHS materials, and TL and TH are the low and
high temperatures of SHS use. Cp is assumed independent of tem-
perature within the narrow temperature range of the SHS application.
In applications below 100 °C, water is the best SHS liquid, because
of its wide availability, low cost and relatively high specific heat.
Above 100 °C, synthetic oils, molten salts, liquid metals, or powders
can be used. For air heating applications, rock bed type storage ma-
terials are more suitable. Besides physical properties, such as density
and specific heat of the storage materials, there are other proper-
ties that are important for the efficiency of SHS, including operational
temperatures, thermal conductivity and diffusivity, vapour pres-
sure, compatibility among materials and their stability, heat losses
as a function of the surface area to volume ratio, and cost of the
materials and systems. A SHS system usually consists of a storage
medium, a container tank, and inlet/outlet connections. To prevent
any potential loss of thermal energy, thermal insulation is re-
quired. The storage medium can be solid or liquid. Solid media, such
as concrete and cast ceramics, are commonly used in the form of
packed beds, which require a fluid for effective heat exchanging and
as heat carrier. If the fluid is a liquid, the system is called a dual
storage system, because the heat capacity of the solid in the packed
bed cannot be neglected. One of the most significant advantages
of the dual system is the use of inexpensive solids, such as rock, sand,
or concrete as storage materials. Liquid media mainly include molten
salts or synthetic oils. They are naturally stratified in the storage
vessel due to the difference in density between hot and cold layers:
the hot fluid is supplied to the upper part of storage during charg-
ing, whereas the cold fluid is extracted from the bottom part during
discharging.

Latent heat storage (LHS) makes use of the heat absorbed or re-
leased by the storage material when it experiences a phase change
between solid and liquid or liquid and gas. The storage capacity of
a LHS system with phase change materials is given by:

where Tm is the melting point of the PCM, Cps and Cpl are the spe-

into the following equation:

LHS with PCMs is at present very promising, because it exhib-
its high energy storage density and can store heat at constant
temperatures, i.e. the phase transition temperatures of the mate-
rials [22–26]. Phase transition may occur in forms of solid–solid,
solid–liquid, solid–gas, and liquid–gas. Among these phase changes,
only the solid–liquid phase change has been used for LHS. Liquid–
gas phase changes are not practical for use as thermal storage due
to the large volumes involved or high pressures required to store
the energy when the compounds are in their gaseous or vapour
phase, although liquid–gas transitions have a higher latent heat of
transformation than solid–liquid transitions. Solid–solid phase
changes are usually too slow and have a very low value of latent
heat of phase change. Although PCMs are expected to have a po-
tential advantage towards energy storage in comparison with sole
sensible heat storage, Fig. 4 illustrates the temperature range where
the efficacy of sensible heat storage of the heat carrier (e.g. sand)
can exceed the latent heat storage capacity, as illustrated for e.g.

Fig. 4. Total heat stored vs. temperature for sensible and latent heat storage mate-
rials. 1: KNO3=NaNO3, 2: NaOH=NaCl, 3: SiO2, 4: SiC, 5: Sb2O3 [27]. HTF: Heat transfer
fluid.

Sb2O3–PCM: the total heat stored is lower than the sensible heat
stored in SiC and/or SiO2. Molten salts KNO3—NaNO3 and
NaOH—NaCl, on the contrary, offer a significant advantage. Due to
the latent heat of fusion, there is a steep jump in energy stored at
the temperature of the PCM melting point.

Thermo-chemical storage (TCS) uses the heat absorbed and re-
leased by a reversible chemical reaction. The amount of heat stored
is proportional to the amount of storage material (m), the endo-
thermic heat of the reaction (ΔHr) and the conversion (α), given by:

It should be remembered that the external heat supply will also
need to cater for the sensible heat of the initial reactant between
the starting (ambient) and the reaction temperature.

For an operation between 750 °C and 250 °C, with specific heat
value around 1 kJ/kg, the heat storage capacity of sensible heat
storage is ~500 kJ/kg, between 700 and 1000 kJ/kg in latent heat
storage due to the contribution of the heat of phase transition, and
in excess of 1000 kJ/kg for thermo-chemical storage, respectively.

1.5. Classifications of thermal energy storage

TES systems can be classified according to different param-
eters, being the temperature range of application, the mechanism
of energy storage, and the integration within the energy storage
concept.

1.5.1. Classification according to temperature range and associated
re-use technology

Essential to be able to capture, store and re-use thermal energy
is the use of a heat transfer fluid (HTF): the ranges of applicable
thermal energy storage are hence a function of the HTF selected.
According to the temperature range at which the system works, TES
can be classified as low temperature thermal energy storage and
high temperature thermal energy storage. In this study the divi-
sion temperature is considered at about 200 °C. The classification
according to the working temperatures of the HTF, TES and thermal
block is illustrated in Fig. 5.

The increased technological risk reflects the impact of safety of
operations at extremely high temperature and the use of high value
construction materials. Traditional HTF include gas, water/steam,
thermal fluids and molten salts. The use of particle suspension as

HTF is considered as a novelty and offers major benefits to enhance
the solar power tower commercial potential [7,21,28]. The use of
particle suspensions as heat carrier to transfer solar heat from the
receiver to the energy conversion process offers major advantages
in comparison with water/steam, thermal fluids or molten salts. Since
the particle suspension has a heat capacity similar to that of molten
salts, without temperature limitation except for the maximum al-

lowable wall temperature of the receiver tube, suspension
temperatures of up to 800 °C can be tolerated for refractory steel
tubes (even higher when using ceramic or glass tubes), thus offer-
ing new opportunities for highly efficient thermodynamic cycles such
as obtained when using supercritical steam or CO2. With higher tem-
perature HTFs, a cascade of effects is noteworthy, with additional
high efficiency thermodynamic systems being viable, as illus-
trated in Fig. 6 and assessed by e.g. Dunham and Iverson [29]. A
higher temperature operation will increase the power cycle effi-
ciency, whilst increasing the temperature range over which the
storage operates, thus enhancing the storage density. The in-
creased efficiency of the power cycle also reduces the thermal power
demand for a constant receiver efficiency, which allows more elec-
tricity to be generated per unit of stored thermal energy. The
increased capacity of the storage moreover increases the power plant
capacity factor, thus reducing investments, despite the use of more
expensive construction materials. If a new high-temperature HTF
is to improve the economics of e.g. SPT applications, the cost re-
duction of the solar field and storage must more than outweigh cost
increases of the receiver and power block. A high temperature
powder circulation loop allows advanced power cycle configura-
tions to be used, albeit not yet exploited in current solar power tower
applications. Such suspension receivers with outlet temperature
above 700 °C are being developed in the Concentrated Solar Power
in Particles European project (CSP2) [30].

Supercritical Rankine cycles and associated steam turbines are
commonly designed for large power outputs (~800 MWel) [31], and
will need to be scaled-down for smaller plants by a redesign in order
to cope with the low volumetric flow rates and the resulting small

blade sizes, although solutions using radial turbines or operating
a high pressure turbine at higher speeds have been suggested [32].
In order to use solar power tower plants in arid locations, the power
block will use dry, indirect cooling for lack of sufficient cooling water.

1.5.2. Classification according to energy storage mechanism

If the material is not subjected to a phase change or a chemical
reaction, due to temperature variations, it is referred to as SHS. LHS
requires the material to absorb or release enough energy to trans-
form its phase structure during melting/solidification. Finally, a TES
system is classified as TCS, if the storage media undergo revers-
ible endothermic/exothermic chemical reactions for heat storage.

1.5.3. Classification according to the storage concept

The different TES concepts are also classified regarding the lo-
cation of the storage media within the TES and on how the energy
reaches it. This classification involves active, passive and hybrid
storage, as illustrated in Fig. 7 and dealt with in detail by Kuravi et al.
[34].

In an active storage system, the storage medium circulates
through a heat exchanger (which can also be a solar receiver or a
steam generator) and it is charged or discharged by forced convec-

tion heat transfer. Active storage systems can be subdivided into
direct and indirect systems, where the former uses the same ma-
terial as heat transfer fluid and storage medium, whereas the latter
uses a secondary storage medium.

Contrary to an active storage, the passive storage medium does
not circulate through the system, but always stays in the same lo-
cation. The heat transfer fluid is responsible of carrying energy
through the system: in the charging process the HTF carries the re-
ceived energy from the energy source to the storage medium and
receives energy from the storage medium when discharging. This
type of system mainly uses a solid heat storage medium such as
concrete, casts, and contained-PCMs.

The hybrid storage combines active and passive concepts in trying

to improve the characteristics of the storage systems.

1.6. Objectives and structure of the paper

Energy capture and storage are “hot” research topics, as illus-
trated by the literature review of Fig. 8: both PCMs (and nanoparticle-
PCM) and TCS are within the focus of increasing current research,
whereas the use of powders as sensible HTF has only recently at-
tracted a lot of interest.

Prior to delineating the objectives of the present review paper,
two previous review papers are important to cite, since both already
deal with specific aspects of TES.

The assessment of Yu et al. [35] evaluates TES by sorption process
using silica gels, zeolites, alumino-phosphates, silico-alumino-
phosphates and metal organic frameworks. These systems are
recognized for their high thermal energy storage densities and long
term applications. Intensive studies are however additionally re-
quired to demonstrate the technical feasibility of the concept.
Sorption energy storage is however not further discussed in the
current review.

A more comprehensive review of TES systems is provided by
Kuravi et al. [31]. This review discusses the thermal energy storage
design and practise for application and integration into concen-
trating solar power plants. This integration is studied at plant,
component and system level. Storage systems using active two-
tank, steam accumulation, extended/embedded heat transfer
structures, and packed bed systems were assessed. Energy and exergy
efficiencies of the TES-systems were calculated to define the eco-
nomic optimization. A life cycle assessment of TES systems and a
case study conclude the research. The present review will exten-
sively refer to Kuravi et al. [34] as far as these specific topics are
concerned. It will however add additional and up-to-date findings
in various fundamental and practical aspects of TES, all integrated
into a design logic as illustrated in Fig. 9.

The structure comprises 7 sections. Section 1 positioned TES
systems and their growing importance within the energy aware-
ness, with aspects of TES classification and its main impacts.

Section 2 will deal with sensible heat storage, well-documented

in literature and hence limited in the content of this review.

Section 3 will deal with latent heat storage, specifically towards
high temperature application, where inorganic substances offer a

high potential. Experimental and modelling data will be com-
pared. Since inorganic solid/liquid phase change materials suffer from
a low thermal conductivity, conductive inserts offer a high poten-
tial, reducing the charging/discharging time by a factor of 2.

Specific applications of latent heat storage with cryogenics and
with steam accumulations will be discussed, both however within
very special ranges of application. Finally, recent developments in
enhanced high temperature PCMs and the important impact of using
lithium salts will be assessed: enhancement techniques appear to
be moderately to highly effective.

Section 4 will review the fundamentals of using reversible chem-
ical reactions to store heat for short to long term periods. Within
the selected reaction pairs, Ca(OH)2, CaCO3, Co3O4 and Mn2O3 offer
a high potential, both towards reaction temperature and revers-
ibility. All reactions can be treated as first order chemical reactions,
with activation energy between 50 and 250 kJ/mol and reaction rates
of 1 to 2 × 10−3 s−1 at reaction equilibrium temperature.

Since latent and thermo-chemical storage medium needs to be
contained in a capsule (sphere, tube, sandwich plates) of appro-
priate materials, Section 5 assesses the mechanical strength of the
containment from both a theoretical and experimental evalua-
tion. Alloy-capsules of 1–2 mm thickness meet the requirements of
long term stability, even after multiple charging/discharging cycles.
Section 6 deals with the current development of a novel heat
transfer fluid, involving particulate suspensions. Literature and ex-
perimental data confirm the high heat transfer coefficient achieved
over 400 W/m2 in circulating fluidized bed, to 1100 W/m2 K in a
dense upflow fluidized bed. A tentative assessment selects to a po-
tential design and demonstrates that particulate suspensions lead
to major savings in investment and operating costs. Finally, Section
7 will summarizes the findings and highlight required priority
research.

2. Sensible heat storage

Sensible heat storage materials undergo no phase change within
the temperature range required for the storage application [14].
Table 4 summarizes the main characteristics of the most common
solid and liquid sensible heat storage materials.

Within the indicated solids, concrete and cast ceramics have been
extensively studied due to their low costs and good thermal con-
ductivities, despite their moderate specific heats. In terms of liquids,
molten salts [17] and mineral oils [38] are widely used in solar towers
and parabolic trough collectors, respectively, being liquid at ambient
pressure, providing an efficient and low cost medium, and having
their operating temperatures compatible with current high-
pressure and high-temperature turbines (temperature range over
120–600 °C). From Table 4, it is clear that the main candidates for
liquid high temperature sensible heat storage are either a solar salt,
i.e. a binary salt consisting of 60% of NaNO3 and 40% of KNO3, that
melts at 221 °C and is kept liquid at 288 °C in an insulated storage
tank; or HitecXL, a ternary salt consisting of 48% Ca(NO3)2, 7% NaNO3,
and 45% of KNO3 operating beyond its melting point of 130 °C.

Common mineral particles, such as silicon carbide, crystobalite
silica, exhibit high values of Cp, and are hence subject of increas-
ing research as SHS media, as described in Section 6 of this paper.
Sensible liquid heat materials have been widely studied and are
currently applied in solar thermal plant applications, despite im-
portant disadvantages that can affect the storage system design and
stability. The low solidification point may be a problem for solar
power plants because of the required heat tracing during non-
functioning periods. Furthermore, the sensible fraction of thermal
energy is seldom fully recovered due to the required temperature
difference for the heat transfer driving force. Another important dis-
advantage consists in the low energy storage density of sensible heat
materials, leading to the requirement of large volumes or quanti-
ties in order to deliver the amount of energy storage necessary for
high temperature thermal energy storage applications. The above
mentioned problems can imply significant increments in the costs
of sensible heat storage systems. For solid SHS media, the number
of available materials is extensive and current handbooks and da-
tabases give no comparison or possible relationships between
properties of materials that enable their selection [39]. Materials
with the highest Cp are natural and polymeric materials, such as
natural rubber or the thermoplastic copolymers (acrylonitrile bu-
tadiene styrene) with a Cp value of around 2 kJ/kg K. Other composite
materials such as glass fibre reinforced epoxy concretes have Cp
values close to 1 kJ/kg K. The specific heat capacity should be con-

sidered in conjunction with the price of the SHS material. Materials
for sensible thermal energy storage in the range of 15–200 °C were
considered and presented by Fernandez et al. [39]. Commercial prices
vary from 0.02 to 0.08 €/kg for standard concrete, from 0.15 to 0.25 €/
kg for high density concrete, from 0.1 to 0.3 €/kg for common mineral
powders, and from 0.5 to 3 €/kg for steel and alloys.

3. Latent heat storage

3.1. Main characteristics

Latent storage systems based on PCMs with solid–liquid tran-
sition are considered to be very efficient in comparison to liquid–
vapour and solid–solid transitions [40]. Liquid–gas transition requires
a large volume recipient for the PCM and the solid–solid transi-
tion presents a low value of latent heat, making both alternatives
not considered as appropriate choices. A large number of materi-
als are known to melt with a moderate to high heat of fusion within
different ranges of temperature. No material yet studied has all the
optimum characteristics required for a PCM, and the selection of a
PCM for a given application requires careful consideration of the
properties of the various substances and/or mixtures [34,41]. The
main disadvantage of a PCM is its low range of thermal conductiv-
ity between 0.2 and 0.8 W/mK, whereas sensible heat materials score
better. Therefore, improving the PCM thermal conductivity will
enhance the TES efficiency by improving its charging/discharging
processes as dealt with below.

3.2. PCMs classification

PCMs are generally classified in different categories consider-
ing their melting temperature and their material composition. The
melting temperature can be divided in two main groups: low tem-
perature (<200 °C) and high temperature (>200 °C). The categories
for material composition are mainly threefold, being organic, in-
organic and eutectic compounds [34], as illustrated in Fig. 10.

Organic materials can repeatedly freeze and melt without phase
segregations and are usually non-corrosive. Both “paraffin” and “non-
paraffin” compounds are limited in use to low and moderate
temperatures, hence outside the scope of the present review. Some
of the features of this group are their high heat of fusion, low thermal
conductivity and instability at high temperatures. Properties are re-
viewed in literature by e.g. Zalba et al. [36], Kuravi et al. [34],
Jegadheeswaran et al. [37] and other authors.

Fig. 10. PCM classification considering material composition [24,36,37].

Inorganics are divided in two main groups called “salt hy-

drates” and “metallics”.

• Salt hydrates are mixtures of inorganic salts and water forming
a typical crystalline solid of general formula AB·nH2O. At the
melting point the hydrate crystals decompose into anhydrous
salt and water, or into a lower hydrate and water. This type of
material is used as PCM due to its high latent heat of fusion per
unit volume, relatively high thermal conductivity (almost twice
the thermal conductivity of paraffin) and small volume changes
at melting. The major problem of salt hydrates is that most of
them have incongruent melting, which means that the salt is not
entirely soluble in its water of hydration at the melting point.
This results in an irreversible melting–freezing and a reduction
of the available salt hydrate with every charge–discharge cycle.
• Metallics include low melting metals and eutectic alloys. Despite
their advantages, they have not yet been considered as a PCM
due to weight penalties. They are used when volume is a con-
sideration because of their high heat of fusion per unit volume.
Other features of these materials are their low heat of fusion per
unit weight, high heat of fusion per unit volume, high thermal
conductivity, low specific heat and relatively low vapour pressure.

Eutectics are melting compositions of two or more compo-
nents, which melt and freeze congruently forming a mixture of the
component crystals during crystallization. Due to this crystalliza-
tion, the materials have little chance of separation. Depending on
the nature of the material composition, they can be divided into
organic–organic, inorganic–inorganic and inorganic–organic. Towards
CSP application, the most used heat storage medium is a eutectic
salt known as “solar salt”. This is a combination of 60% NaNO3 and
40% KNO3.

The low-temperature PCMs (organic, inorganic or eutectic) are
mainly used in waste heat recovery systems and buildings, while
high temperature PCMs (inorganic or eutectic) can be used in solar
power plants and other high temperature applications [25].

When developing a TES system, the selection of a PCM is an im-
portant task, and the selected PCM must fit the requirements of the
system. Abhat [26], Jegadheeswaran et al. [37] and Zalba et al. [36]
described the main criteria that govern this selection, which can
be classified in thermal, physical, chemical and economical
properties.

Thermal properties should include a melting point in the desired
operating temperature range (temperature range of application);
a high latent heat of fusion per unit mass, so that a smaller amount

of material stores a given amount of energy; a high specific heat
to provide additional significant sensible heat storage effects; and
a high thermal conductivity, so that the temperature gradients for
charging and discharging the storage material are small.

Physical properties should account for small volume changes
during phase transition, so that a simple container and heat ex-
changer geometry can be used; a high density; exhibiting little or
no sub-cooling during freezing; and a low vapour pressure in order
to avoid stresses and problems with the container and the needed
heat exchangers.

Chemical properties of the PCMs are focused upon their chem-
ical stability without decomposition; whilst avoiding corrosion of
construction materials. They must moreover contain non-poisonous,
non-flammable and non-explosive elements/compounds. Phase seg-
regation should be avoided.

Towards process economy, PCM materials should be available in

large quantities at low cost.

Since organic PCMs have applications at low to moderate tem-
perature (110–260 °C) only, Table 5 only lists physical properties of
non-organic PCMs.

To the extent of our current knowledge, there is no commer-
cial high temperature thermal energy storage module using PCM
storage, and only experimental modules have been constructed and
assessed. According to a recent study of the International Renew-
able Energy Agency (IRENA) [43], the status of the market for high
temperature thermal energy storage modules is still low. All the in-
vestment in this area has been focused on research and development.
One PCM test module recorded in literature was developed within
the DISTOR project, developed by the Institute of Technical Ther-
modynamics of the German Aerospace Center (DLR), which focuses
on the development of thermal storage systems using PCM in the
temperature range from 230 °C to 330 °C for systems using steam
between 30 and 100 bar. In this context, this project has devel-
oped innovative PCMs and heat transfer concepts to overcome PCM
disadvantages. From their research, they could conclude that the
finned tube design is the most promising and technically feasible
concept, therefore, it was decided to build a test 200 kW PCM storage
module based on the finned tube module design [44].

3.3. Moderate or high temperature PCMs

Although different PCMs can be used within a temperature range
of 300–700/800 °C, as illustrated in Table 5, their application at these
temperatures is still subject of widespread investigation. PCM
usage in high temperature thermal energy storage has been

experimented for solar plant applications, but it has not yet been
commercially used [45,46]. The development of high temperature
thermal energy storage using PCMs is of increasing interest since
they are fairly cheap, have a high energy density, can be available
in large quantities, and are able to store and release thermal energy
at a constant temperature. In addition to adapting PCM melting
points to a high temperature range, their heat conduction charac-
teristics need to be improved in order to increase the efficiency of
the charging and discharging processes. Although PCMs are ex-
pected to have a potential advantage towards energy storage in
comparison with sole sensible heat storage, Fig. 4 illustrated that
the efficiency of sensible heat storage can in some cases exceed the
contained sensible and latent heat of the PCM. Molten salts gen-
erally offer significant advantages. To counteract the slow charging/
discharging rates of PCMs, the integration of high conductivity
structures has been investigated. Figs. 11 and 12 illustrate some of
the experimental results [27].

The experimental results illustrate the effect of different param-
eters. The temperature of phase change should be a constant 230 °C,

as obtained when a pure substance solidifies. With mixtures, the
solidification takes place over a range of temperatures, sometimes
referred to as the “mushy region” between the solid and liquid zones
[36]. The effect of inserted metallic foam or metallic sponge is
evident, with a significantly shorter discharge rate as a result. The
curve with forced water cooling (hence with a far higher external
heat transfer coefficient) is very steep, and the temperature de-
creases from 270 °C to 160 °C in less than 700 s (against 2500–
3700 s when air cooling is applied). This external heat transfer
coefficient is an important parameter of the Biot-number, the di-

et al. [49] and later extended by Pitié et al. [50] and Parrado
et al. [51], presenting the confined melting in composite ma-
terials made of graphite-nitrates, ceramic-nitrates, and copper-
nitrates, respectively. Comsol-Multiphysics offers additional
calculation procedures such as internal pressure build-up due
to the thermal expansion of the PCM. The procedure “Thermal
Stress contains Heat Transfer and Solid Mechanics phenom-
ena” needs to be used. In order to provide results with a
minimum error range, it uses an extra-fine mesh. The shell
wall is considered to be homogeneous, isotropic and present
at a known and uniform temperature. At the interfaces, an
equality of phase temperature and heat flux continuity at the
melting front, and an equality of temperature and pressure
at the shell/salt interface are accepted.

To predict the effective thermal conductivities of the PCM with
inserts (foam, sponge), a series of empirical correlations was used,
as listed in Table 6. The symbols keff, kPCM and kINS represent respec-
tively the effective thermal conductivities of the composite mix, the
thermal conductivity of the PCM itself, and the thermal conduc-
tivity of the insert. The porosity, ε, represents the void space (PCM-
filled) of the composites. The sphericity, Ψ, is estimated at 0.95 for
the composites. The predicted values for the composite systems are
given in Table 7, with ±10% deviation noticed between the differ-
ent predicted and average values. The inserts clearly increase the

a slightly higher effect that the metallic foam.

Fig. 13 illustrates the comparison of calculated and experimen-
tal discharging rates of both liquid and solid PCM [27,49]: within
the temperature range under consideration, cooling rates can be fairly
well represented by a linear relationship of temperature and time.
This results in respective cooling rates, ΔT/Δt (°C/s), which provide
a tentative comparison as presented in Fig. 12.

The theoretical calculation of the cooling rate of the liquid PCM
underestimates the experimental temperature gradient, due to the
fact that only conduction is taken into consideration, whilst natural
convection within the liquid phase also contributes to the heat trans-
fer. When calculating the Rayleigh-number within the liquid salt,
values exceeding 107 are obtained, significantly above the thresh-
old 1700 normally given for the onset of natural convection. Since
it is difficult to predict the contribution of natural convection, Zalba
et al. [36] propose to characterize the melt by an effective thermal
conductivity, exceeding the thermal conductivity as such. An ex-
pression of this effective thermal conductivity could not be obtained
yet, but it should indeed be expressed as: k
with
Ra being the Rayleigh number.

To fit the experimental results, the value of the f(Ra) ranges from
1.2 to 1.4, but further refining is required. The Comsol predictions
of the temperature evolution are very promising, again with an un-
derestimation of the cooling rate in the liquid phase, but a close
prediction of the periods of phase transformation and solid’s cooling.

3.4. Specific PCM applications

3.4.1. Latent heat storage with cryogenics

Cryogenic fuels, such as liquefied natural gas, have been deemed
to be promising alternative fuels due to their high energy density
[57]. They are stored at extremely low temperatures to maintain
the liquid state. At the consumers end, the cryogenic liquids need
to be re-gasified to about ambient temperature, and plenty of cryo-
genic cooling capacity would be released during this vapourization
process. It is therefore quite important and imperative to maxi-
mize the recovery of the cold energy either through the use of other
cryogens or PCMs [55,56]. Cryogens normally refer to as liquid media
at a temperature below approximately −150 °C and are physical
energy carriers [58]. The use of cryogen as an energy carrier is dif-
ferent from normal heat storage in that the energy is stored through

decreasing its internal energy while increasing its exergy. The use
of liquid air/nitrogen as an energy carrier is not commonly known
until fairly recently [59–61]. Cryogenic energy storages can have a
relatively high energy density (100–200 W h/kg), low capital cost
per unit energy, are benign to the environment and have a rela-
tively long storage period. However, it has a relatively low efficiency
(40–50%) according to the current energy consumption for air liq-
uefaction [61]. Cryogenic energy storage is still under development
by Mitsubishi (Japan) [62], the University of Leeds (UK) and the
Chinese Academy of Sciences [63]. Specific topics of research involve
hydrogen releases [64], the phase change itself [65,66], and inte-
grated applications [67,68]. Table 8 and Table 9 illustrate that
although the specific heat and phase change heat of the cryogens
are of a similar order of magnitude than those of common heat
storage materials, the exergy density of cryogens is much higher.
Once produced and stored in insulated containers, the cryogen
is ready to be delivered. No extra energy is required except for the
pumping power consumption which is negligible. The only energy
loss of the cryogen is the heat dissipation of the cryogenic tank,
which can be less than 1% per day using conventional insulation
technologies [70–72].

The exergy efficiency for a cryogenic engine is about 40% as a
considerable portion of the exergy is in the form of cold, which is
wasted during the heating process. In order to improve the effi-
ciency, the recovery of the waste cold energy can be integrated with
the direct expansion of the cryogen using cycles such as the Rankine
cycle as shown in Fig. 15. Many power cycles, based on Rankine and
Brayton cycles, were proposed to recover the cooling capacity of cryo-

genic liquids [74–77]. Cryogenic liquids vapourizers are commonly
used as low temperature thermal sinks for the bottom Rankine cycle
(see Fig. 14), with waste heat or low-grade thermal energy (to
enhance exergy efficiency) as thermal sources. Its alternative heat
source could also be using the atmosphere [60], unlike a conven-
tional heat engine that uses the atmosphere as a cold reservoir or
heat sink. The combined methods for cryogenic energy extraction
have been discussed in detail by Li et al. [61,68]. It has been con-
cluded that the combined cycle cryogenic heat engines could have
an exergy efficiency of 65–78% under ideal conditions [78].

Chen et al. [79] claimed that the exergy efficiency could be im-
proved from ~78 to 117% if the working fluid were superheated to
~100 °C, and the exergy efficiency could be doubled if the waste heat
temperature is as high as 300 °C.

3.4.2. Latent heat storage with steam accumulators

The accumulator is an insulated steel pressure tank containing
hot water and steam under pressure, thus storing energy in the form
of latent heat stored in the liquid phase, i.e. water. It releases steam
by extracting latent heat when needed and to accept steam when
the demand is low. The volume specific thermal energy densities
are typically in the range of 20–30 kW h/m3. The released steam
powers the steam turbine for electricity production. Storing steam
under pressure in saturated or superheated conditions in pressure
vessels is generally not economic due to the low volumetric energy
density [73]; it is nevertheless applied in specific cases as buffer
between e.g. a boiler and the steam-driven process of a paper mills
[80].

Fig. 15. Pressure drop accumulator [73].

There are three types of steam accumulators, as described and

illustrated in Steinmann and Eck [73] and DOE [81]:

• Water filled accumulator:

1. Constant pressure accumulator: usually arranged in a verti-
cal position to allow for both hot and cold water to be stored
in the same vessel via thermal stratification, where the hot
water is in the top part and the cold water in the bottom part.
2. Pressure drop accumulator: also called feed water accumu-
lators, where pressure and temperature are allowed to vary
(see Fig. 15). The accumulator is usually arranged horizon-
tally and when fully charged, it is usually at 90% full of water.
• Supercritical steam accumulator: this requires a storage condi-
tion of a minimum temperature of 647 K at pressure of 220 bar.

During the thermal storage process the temperature of the liquid
water can be increased by condensation of superheated steam, with
little variation of the liquid storage mass; or the mass in the volume
is increased by feeding saturated liquid water into the system, where
the pressure remains constant, charging indirectly where a heat ex-
changer is integrated into the liquid volume. The medium flowing
in the heat exchanger needs not be water; hence heat from a heat
source at lower pressure can be used.

Steam is charged beneath the surface of the water by a distri-
bution manifold, which is fitted with a series of steam injectors, until
the entire water content is at the required pressure and tempera-
ture. If the steam accumulator is charged using saturated (or wet)
steam, there may be a small gain in water due to the radiation losses
from the vessel.

To avoid a pressure drop in a constant pressure water filled ac-
cumulator, the application of a separate flash evaporator is required,
where the saturated liquid water is taken from the steam accumu-
lator, which is later depressurized externally. Cold water is fed into
the bottom of the storage vessel to keep the water level constant,
where mixing of hot and cold water must be minimized. Thermal
stress resulting from filling the pressure vessel with cold water must
be considered [73]. An alternative option is to maintain constant
pressure by integrating PCM into the storage vessel partly replac-
ing the liquid water (Fig. 16). PCMs usually exhibit a low thermal
conductivity so layers of this material must be thin to ensure a suf-
ficient heat transfer rate or via the encapsulation of PCM in small
containers placed inside the liquid volume. PCM is not only attrac-
tive regarding the avoidance of thermo-mechanical stress, the

characteristic volume-specific storage capacity of PCMs is also de-
sirable, which is in the range of about 100 kW h/m3, significantly
exceeding water (20–30 kW h/m3) [73].

The design of accumulators should fulfill important criteria, as

listed by DOE [81] and summarized below:

• Provide sufficient time from the end of one overload period to
the beginning of the next, to fully recharge the accumulator.
• Sufficient surplus boiler capacity should be available to re-
charge the water stored in the accumulator during off-peak times.
• The accumulator volume should be large enough to contain
enough water to provide the required amount of flash steam
during the discharge period.

Fig. 16. Constant pressure accumulator with PCM [73].

16

H. Zhang et al./Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 53 (2016) 1–40

• Higher steam release rates will produce wet steam, prevented
by ensuring a large enough water surface area, and hence again
determining the accumulator size.

• The evaporation capacity must be sufficient. This is a function
of the pressure at which the water is stored when fully charged
(the boiler pressure) and the minimum pressure at which the
accumulator will operate at the end of the discharge period (the
accumulator design pressure). More flash steam is produced when
the differential between these two pressures increases.

• The accumulator design pressure must be higher than the down-
stream distribution pressure, to create a pressure differential and
allow for the required flow.

• The steam inlet pipes must feed well below the water surface
level to ensure the maximum possible liquid head above them.
The steam injectors should be installed at a slight angle to avoid
erosion of the vessel, and discharge at a very high velocity to
provide turbulence and mixing of the stored water mass.

• Both the design of the inlet pipe and the manifold system, to-
gether with the location of the steam injectors, must provide even
injection of steam throughout the length of the accumulator re-
gardless of the actual steam flow-rate.

The steam injector capacity will reduce as the pressure in the
vessel increases because the differential pressure between the in-
jected steam and the vessel pressure is reduced. At very low flow
rates, the steam feed will not be uniformly distributed and will tend
to issue from the injectors closest to the steam inlet pipe.

Supercritical water is water that exists above its thermody-
namic critical point (374 °C, 22.1 MPa). Using water as the working
fluid at supercritical conditions, the respective efficiencies can be
raised from about 39% for subcritical operation to about 45% using
current technology. The supercritical fluid is a single non-condensable
phase which has physical properties that are intermediary between
its liquid phase and gaseous phase, with a density typically being
closer to that of water but with transport properties being gas-
like. Supercritical water at low density behaves like a non-polar
solvent unlike its liquid counterpart due to loss of hydrogen bonding
[82]. It has high thermal efficiency, as it combines high tempera-
ture, high pressure and its existence as a single phase which benefits
from relative simplicity in system design due to not having to handle
multi-phase flow.

The problems associated with supercritical steam is that the pres-
ence of ionic species can induce corrosion. At low ionic density (low
pressure), corrosion is typically more severe in subcritical than
supercritical water, due to the fact that ionic species are insoluble
in supercritical water at low density. This is the reason that com-
ponents and/or piping used to preheat or cool fluids in a supercritical

water system are more susceptible to corrosion than the reactor itself
[83–85]. At high ionic density (high pressure), most salts will be
soluble. Therefore, pure distilled water should be used in supercritical
water/steam accumulator to eliminate salt-induced corrosion.

Pressure vessels are designed to have a thickness proportional
to the radius and operating pressure of the tank, and inversely pro-
portional to the maximum allowed normal stress of the particular
material used in the walls of the container. Theoretically, any ma-
terial with good tensile properties that is chemically stable in the
chosen application could be employed. No matter the shape, the
minimum mass of a pressure vessel scales with the pressure and
volume it contains and is inversely proportional to the strength to
weight ratio of the construction material (minimum mass de-
creases as strength increases). Godall [86] has suggested that the
best ratio of diameter to total length of a steam accumulator should
be between 1:4 and 1:6 in order to obtain optimal condition in terms
of thermal storage capacity and material cost.

3.4.3. Moderate to high temperature PCMs

Within the high temperature thermal energy storage option using
PCMs, various alternatives have been investigated, as illustrated in
Fig. 17. Each of the parallel topics is subsequently dealt with. To il-
lustrate the practical use of the results reported in previous sections,
design approaches for thermal energy storage installations are further
elaborated. This will be demonstrated by describing potential ap-
plications of high temperature thermal energy storage in three typical
case studies:

• The encapsulated PCM is mixed within a high temperature con-

crete for passive heat energy storage.

• The encapsulated PCM is mixed in a liquid HTF.
• The encapsulated PCM is used in a solid–gas conveying system

as heat carrier.

In these case studies, described in Table 10, the coated PCM in-

teracts with a different heat carrier, being solid, liquid or gas.

3.4.4. The growing importance of lithium salts
3.4.4.1. Lithium for sensible heat storage. Lithium has been used to
improve the properties of molten salts used in CSP by adding it to
their composition. Fig. 18 shows new compositions with lithium and
in comparison with the commercial solar salt (34 wt% KNO3 and
66 wt% NaNO3): the salts have nearly similar heat capacities, there-
fore they have similar energy density. The benefits of adding lithium
to solar salts are noticed in the melting temperature of the com-
position, which is lowered. The range of working temperature is
extended, whilst improving the thermal stability [91]. Due to the

concept

A three component thermal storage system, combining sensible and latent heat storage was tested by Laing et al. [44] for use in solar
power plants. Investigations and experiments supported the hypothesis that high temperature concrete could serve as sensible heat
storage up to 500 °C. Within the limitations of the solid concrete structure, the incorporation of phase-change materials is beneficial since
capable of absorbing a high quantity of energy (sensible and latent heat), while keeping the temperature of the matrix close to the
melting point of the phase change.
This use of encapsulated PCM mixed with concrete was further demonstrated for applications at ambient temperatures [16,24,87],
achieving high energy savings in cooling power.
A micro-encapsulated PCM slurry is a suspension where the PCM is dispersed at 10–20 wt % without significantly altering the physical
properties of the liquid (density, viscosity) [88]: PCM is microencapsulated using a polymeric capsule and dispersed in water. A slurry
with a 10 wt % concentration of paraffin was conducted by Delgado et al. [89] to investigate the effectiveness of its properties as a thermal
storage material and as a heat transfer fluid. Results demonstrated an increase of approximately 25% in the convective heat transfer
coefficient when compared to water, as the result of improving the overall heat capacity of the material through applying the latent heat
properties of the PCM.
The feasibility of using ionic liquids as liquid thermal storage media and heat transfer fluids in a solar thermal power plant has been the
subject of additional investigations. According to Bridges et al. [90], nanoparticle enhanced ionic liquids have been shown to increase the
heat capacity of the ionic liquid without adverse secondary effects on the ionic liquids’ thermal stability. The ionic liquid physical
properties were shown to be only affected in cases of high nanoparticle loading. Those similarities between high and low temperature
slurries’ properties tend to indicate that a high temperature equivalent of an encapsulated PCM slurry is possible.
Heat storage units of new concentrated solar plants could benefit from a heat transfer fluid which incorporates encapsulated particles of
PCM. The heat transfer capacities would be improved by the high conductivity and the high energy density of the PCM. In comparison
with a conventional thermal fluid, e.g. Santotherm 350, the specific heat will be increased by a fraction of 3 whilst the energy density will
increase by about 5.
The main issues for developing salt-PCM modifications would be the loss of fluidity of the high temperature slurry. Further studies have
to prove if the addition of particles increases the thermal properties of the HTF without affecting the viscosity and associated pumping
power needed. Existing CSPs would then see their global efficiency improved by the higher energy density of the HTF.
High heat transfer coefficients can be achieved between a fluidized bed of coated PCM particles and a heat exchanging surface [7]: heat
can be captured by the particulate gas–solid flowing suspension. Further research is required, since it was impossible to coat the PCM
particles by a non-porous metallic layer (chemical vapour deposition or electrolysis)

lower temperatures, it is expected that operational and mainte-
nance costs of CSPs are reduced, therefore savings should be obtained
[91]. In terms of costs, the U.S. Department of Energy performed a
comparison between salts used for CSP, including solar salt (40%
KNO3 and 60% NaNO3), and the cost of storing energy with each of
them in a two tank system [92].

Results are shown in Table 11: despite the higher price of the
salts with lithium nitrate, a lower cost per stored kWth is achieved,

which can be attributed to the higher energy densities and the
savings in heat tracing to keep the salts molten.

3.4.4.2. Lithium compounds as phase change materials. PCMs in-
cluding lithium have been a potential for building applications and
for high temperature TES. There are different lithium compounds
to be used in building applications which are compared to the well-
known octadecane and Glauber salt in Fig. 19. It can be seen that

with a latent heat in excess of 300 kJ/kg are considered of high po-
tential towards different applications [91–94]. Lithium compositions
for high temperature TES are illustrated in Fig. 20.

The advantage of using Li-based PCMs is illustrated in Table 12,
where important properties are compared with a common NaNO3/
KNO3 molten salt.

Table 12 shows that a lithium salt mixture has the advantage of
a lower point of fusion and twice the sensible heat compared with
the current solar salt. The density values are quite similar, but the
price of the Li mixture is more than two times that of solar salt. Re-

tion of heat tracing parasitics and a reduced amount of material can
be obtained. These improvements will reduce the final prices of in-
vestment and cost of energy.

3.4.4.3. Lithium market. As far as the availability of the metal is con-
cerned, the worldwide reserves of lithium are estimated in 36.72
million tonnes, with Bolivia, Chile, Argentina and China having es-
timated reserves of 8.9, 8.04, 7.09 and 5.15 million tonnes
respectively. Other countries in Europe, Australia, Africa, Russia and
Canada represent reserves of 0.7–1.5 million tonnes each. As illus-
trated in Table 12, the cost of Li salts is about 2–3 times the cost
of common alkali-nitrates.

3.5. Mechanisms to improve phase change material applications

3.5.1. General principles

To improve the efficiency of the charging and discharging pro-
cesses of PCMs, the most relevant parameter to be studied is their
thermal conductivity. In order to increase the thermal conductiv-
ity of PCMs, several heat transfer enhancement techniques have been
studied [14,27,34], such as the use of metal carrier structures made
of steel or stainless steel; a dispersion of high conductivity mate-
rial i.e. copper, silver or aluminium particles, within the PCM; the
impregnation of high conductivity porous materials, either as a metal
foam (copper, steel or aluminium) or as porous material like graph-
ite; the use of high conductivity, low density materials such as carbon
fibres and paraffin composites; and the micro-encapsulation of PCMs
using graphite [48], polymers, or the nickel film coating of PCM
copper spheres [95]. The general review of these techniques was
undertaken by Agyenim et al. [96], and the encapsulation of PCM
in shells was determined as being one of the most promising and
suitable approaches at the present stage of the investigations. The
reasons behind this selection are the result of the detailed assess-
ment, which summarizes as given below.

3.5.2. Review of applied enhancement methods
3.5.2.1. Fins. Fins are being used in order to increase the heat trans-
fer surface area with the storage media [97], therefore enhancing
the rate at which thermal energy is distributed within it. They can
be axial or radial and are usually attached to tubes [98]. Depend-
ing on their shape and their configuration inside the storage tank
with the storage media, this mechanism has different results. For
example, according to Zhang and Faghri [99], for internally finned
tubes, the melting fraction volume can be significantly increased
by adding more fins and increasing their thickness and height.

Castell et al. [98] experimented adding longitudinal graphite fins
to PCMs (sodium acetate trihydrate whose melting point is 58 °C)
and tested if these fins could decrease the solidification time of PCMs.
They concluded that despite fins altered natural convection within
the PCM and they did not enhance the heat transfer coefficient of
the material, it was possible to decrease the solidification time of
the PCM. Two cases where analysed: PCMs with small fins and PCM
with longer fins. Both were compared with a base case module which
had no fins. In the first case, a lower temperature difference was
necessary to achieve the same heat transfer coefficient as with no
fins. Therefore, the needed time to solidify the PCM decreased. In
the second case, a lower heat transfer coefficient was obtained in
comparison to the PCM with no fins. This was attributed to the width
of the fins that should be interfering with natural convection of the
PCM. Despite that the heat transfer coefficient decreased, it is im-
portant to notice that the solidification time of the PCM was reduced.
Lamberg [100] analysed the two phase solidification problem in
a low temperature finned PCM storage system (it used aluminium
fins and paraffin as PCM) by using an approximate analytical model.
It is important to note that the geometry of the storage module had
a big influence in the accuracy of the analytical model. Hence,
through this analysis, it was concluded that the solidification was
dominated by conduction while natural convection existed only
during the beginning of the solidification process. In terms of com-
parison, the natural convection is negligible compared to conduction.
Erek et al. [97] numerically and experimentally investigated latent
heat thermal energy storage with phase change around a radially
finned tube. The results showed that the stored energy increases
with increasing fin radius and decreasing fin space.

Velraj et al. [101] investigated the solidification of PCM in a cy-
lindrical vertical tube with radial internal fins arrangement. It was
concluded that this configuration, which forms a V-shaped enclo-
sure for the PCM, gives maximum benefit to the fin arrangement.
With an imposed constant heat flux as a boundary condition,
Talati et al. [102], and Mostaffa et al. [103] studied solidification of
a finned rectangular PCM storage analytically and numerically, with
the salt hydrate ClimSel C23 as the PCM and aluminium for the fins.
Results showed that when the length of fin to the height of storage
ratio is smaller than unity, the PCM solidified more quickly in the
storage.

Within the framework of the DISTOR project [104], a prototype
of high temperature thermal energy storage module with graph-
ite fins was tested: to increase the transfer area, expanded graphite
was adhered to tubes through which flowed a bi-phase medium.
It was concluded that for the same amount of PCM, area and metal
material, heat transfer was enhanced by using fins [104].

3.5.2.2. Fluidized bed. The term “fluidized bed” is unavoidably con-
nected to the term “particulate solid material” [105–110]. The
geometrical, physical and aerodynamical properties of the par-
ticles affect the onset of fluidization, the characteristics, behaviour
and the main parameters of fluidized beds. The most important solid
properties are particle density, diameter, and porosity.

Recently, this technology has been used to store energy through
PCM. Izquierdo-Barrientos et al. [111] studied the performance of
an air-fluidized bed of micro-encapsulated PCM as a thermal storage

system and compared it with a fluidized bed of sand and a fixed
bed with sand and PCM. They concluded that PCM is an alterna-
tive material that can be used to increase the efficiency of storing
thermal energy in the form of latent heat in fluidized bed systems.
In fact, under the experimental conditions tested in this work, greater
charging efficiencies are observed for the PCM than with just sand
in fixed and fluidized beds. Furthermore, when the charging effi-
ciency is stabilized, the PCM shows similar results for both beds.
The PCM also presents a better recovery efficiency for both beds after
the solidification time. Moreover, the influence of the bed height
was tested. This study showed that it takes longer to achieve a certain
temperature when more mass is used, but higher efficiency values
are obtained. The analysis of the influence of the flow rate showed
that a higher flow rate allows a faster achievement of the set tem-
perature. At the end of the charging process, similar efficiencies are
measured at the different studied flow rates. The cycling study re-
vealed that the PCM suffers attrition during the fluidization process,
although no loss of PCM is observed under the experimental con-
ditions tested in this work (75 h of continuous operation with 15
charging/discharging cycles).

Pitié et al. [7] introduced PCMs and their potential application
in high temperature energy capture and storage, using a circulat-
ing fluidized bed (CFB) as transfer/storage mode. Thermal
considerations determined the optimum size range for the applied
particles (<400 μm) when convection heat transfer dominates. In
the design of a CFB heat collector, the heat transfer coefficient
between the riser wall and the flowing suspension is an impor-
tant design parameter to determine the required heat exchange
surface area.

Peng et al. [112] predicted the thermal behaviour of the system
with a concentric-dispersion model for a packed bed latent heat
thermal energy storage using PCM capsules and a molten salt HTF.
The radial heat transfer and wall heat losses were considered. The
effects of PCM capsule diameter, fluid inlet velocity and storage tank
height on the temperature profiles and efficiency of a packed bed
were investigated for the charging process. The heat transfer between
PCM capsules and molten salt was shown to be significantly influ-
enced by the capsule diameter, with finer sizes shortening the
effective charging time, thus increases the charging efficiency. The
numerical concentric-dispersion model established by the authors
enables a fair prediction of the thermal behaviour in a packed bed
latent heat thermal energy storage. The fluid inlet velocity has a
smaller influence on the charging process, whereas a higher thermal
storage tank increases the charging efficiency.

3.5.2.3. Microencapsulation. Microencapsulation is defined as a
process in which tiny particles or droplets are surrounded by a
coating, or embedded in a homogeneous or heterogeneous matrix,
to produce small capsules with many useful properties [113–116].
Unless the matrix encapsulating the PCM has a high thermal con-
ductivity, the microencapsulation system suffers from low heat
transfer rate. The rigidity of the matrix prevents convection cur-
rents and all heat transfer needs to occur by conduction. This can
reduce seriously the heat transfer rates, especially in the charging
process. The most important parameters in microencapsulation are
the thickness of the shell; the geometry of the encapsulation; and
the encapsulation size [117].

Microencapsulation of phase change materials refers to a tech-
nique in which a large number of small PCM particles are contained
within a sealed, continuous matrix which ranges in size from less
than 1 mm to more than 300 mm [118]. Nowadays the cost of the
microencapsulation is high compared to other storage methods, and
it is used only in thermal control applications [116]. Microencap-
sulation of PCMs is an effective way of enhancing their thermal
conductivity and preventing possible interaction with the surround-
ings and leakage during the melting process. This method is classified

20

H. Zhang et al./Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 53 (2016) 1–40

into three categories: physical, physico-chemical, and chemical
methods.

Li [119] studied the improvement in thermal conductivity of PCMs
(paraffin) with nano-graphite. It was demonstrated that nano-
graphite can be prepared easily from exfoliated graphite and
expanded graphite. Moreover, the price of nano-graphite is low, while
the improvement effect of nano-graphite on the thermal conduc-
tivity is significant. Results showed that the thermal conductivity
of the composite PCMs with 1% and 10% nano-graphite is 2.89 times
and 7.41 times of that of paraffin, respectively. The phase change
temperature of the nano-graphite/paraffin composite PCM was
slightly less than that of pure paraffin. As the nano-graphite content
increased, the thermal conductivity of the nano-graphite/paraffin
composite increased while the latent heat gradually decreased.

Parrado et al. [51] conducted a numerical study of a deform-
able spherical copper shell containing solar salt at high temperatures.
The thermo-mechanical analysis by Comsol Multiphysics was per-
formed during charging and discharging, and showed that the
volume expansion and pressure rise are below the acceptable me-
chanical properties of copper and are not expected to crack the shell.

3.5.2.4. Macroencapsulation. A significant quantity of heat storage
media is encapsulated, where the mass per unit may range from
grams to kilograms [40]: by careful selection of the capsule geom-
etry and the capsule material, the macroencapsulation can be used
for a wide variety of energy storage needs. The shape of
macrocapsules varies from rectangular panels to spheres or pouches
without a defined shape. The macrocapsule shape selection will
depend on the needs and design of each intended application. Ac-
cording to Regin et al. [40] the most cost-effective containers are
plastic bottles (high density and low density polyethylene bottles,
polypropylene bottles), tin-plated metal cans and mild steel cans.
In the DISTOR project using PCM and expanded graphite, a
macroencapsulation of phase change materials was tested [104]. The
extra volume required in this process, based on the thermal ex-
pansion of PCM due to temperature changes, drastically reduced the
volumetric storage capacity [101]. This design was compared with
the graphite fin concept, mentioned above. Results showed that for
the same amount of PCM, the same area and material for heat ex-
change, heat transfer is more effective using fins.

Cascades of macroencapsulated PCMs, as will be further de-
tailed in Section 3.7, can store 50% more energy per unit volume
than the conventional system using two tanks.

3.5.2.5. Metal matrix. A metal matrix, such as a porous matrix, has
been used to enhance the heat transfer rate in TES. A porous matrix
is characterized by two parameters, i.e. the porosity and the cell size
which refer respectively to the percentage of volume that will be
occupied by PCM and the size of the pore expressed in pores per
inch (PPI). For the first parameter, Mesalhy et al. [120] indicated that
the performance improvement depends on both the porosity of the
matrix and its conductivity. Low values of porosity lead to a higher
effective thermal conductivity, resulting in an increased perfor-
mance enhancement. However, a decrease in the porosity has the
opposite effect because the low porosity of the matrix hampers the
movement of the liquid PCM and the natural convection. For the
second parameter, Elgafy et al. [121] showed how the mean pore
size of the additives could be of critical importance on the system
performance. If it is too small, the PCM molecular motion will be
hindered, thereby it will be very difficult to impregnate the porous
media with the PCM, which will adversely affect the latent heat
storage capacity.

Metals with the highest thermal conductivities are silver, copper,
gold and aluminium [122], which turns them into a desirable option
for metal matrix production to latent heat thermal energy storage
systems. Their characteristics are given in Table 13. Due to their lower

are most commonly used. Also, nickel has been studied, as re-
ported in Table 14.

3.5.2.6. Graphite composites. Another alternative to improve thermal
energy storage materials is producing a new compound with the
storage media. To improve the PCM thermal conductivity, the use
of graphite to enhance the heat transfer rate has been investi-
gated by numerous researchers.

Mehling et al. [130] demonstrated that PCM/graphite compos-
ites show a significant improvement in the heat transfer within latent
heat storage materials. They studied two PCMs: the eutectic salt
MgNO3/LiNO3·6H2O and paraffin RT50. In fact, the thermal conduc-
tivity in the composite material is up to 100 times higher than in
the pure PCM, leading to the phase front moving between 10 and
30 times faster.

Py et al. [131] experimented a new supported PCM made of par-
affin impregnated by capillary forces in compressed expanded
natural graphite (CENG) matrix. High loads of paraffin were ob-
tained: from 65% to 95% weight depending upon the bulk graphite
matrix density. Composite PCM/CENG thermal conductivities were
found to be equivalent to those of the sole graphite matrix from 4
to 70 W/mK instead of the 0.24 W/mK of the pure paraffin. Thermal
power and capacity of the composite are theoretically compared to
those of conventional systems in the case of two usual external ge-
ometries: tubes and spherical hollow nodules. The compressed
expanded natural graphite induced a decrease in overall solidifi-
cation time and a stabilization of the thermal storage power. An
optimization procedure of the composite composition was pro-
posed according to the antagonistic behaviours of the thermal power
and the thermal capacity in respect to the compressed expanded
natural graphite content. Within the usual external heat transfer
coefficient range, the estimated compressed expanded natural graph-
ite matrix optimized densities fell within the practicable range.

Cabeza et al. [132] investigated three heat enhancement methods
to improve the low conductivity of the PCM water/ice. These were
the addition of stainless steel pieces, copper pieces, and a graph-
ite matrix impregnated with the PCM. The use of graphite composite
allows an even larger increase in the heat transfer than with copper.
The heat flux is about four times larger on heating and three times
larger on cooling as compared to using pure ice.

Lopez et al. [49] studied the behaviour of graphite with closed
and open pores, made with salt as a PCM. A pore-thermo-elastic
analysis was performed from which was concluded that varia-
tions in expansion volumes of the salt due to fusion were limited
by the matrix of graphite, which causes an increase of pressure in
the pores. Higher pressure causes a progressive increase in the
melting temperature of the salt and a gradual decrease of the latent
heat. This implies that a significant part of the energy supplied to
the material is used to heat it (sensible heat instead of latent heat).
Zhao et al. [133] studied the addition of the highly thermal con-
ductive ENG-TSA (expanded natural graphite treated with sulphuric
acid) to solar salt (60% sodium nitrate and 40% potassium nitrate),
in order to enhance the thermal conductivity of nitrates when used

The addition of metal foams with a cell size of 10 PPI and 95% porosity can increase
the overall heat transfer rate by 3–10 times. Also, smaller porosities and pore densities
produced better heat transfer performance, depending on the metal foam parameters.
The equivalent thermal conductivity of a foam-wax composite was found to be 3.8 W/
mK, which was 18 times higher than that of pure paraffin wax, i.e. 0.21 W/mK.
Moreover, copper foam reduced the time required to melt approximately the same
amount of wax to 36% of that without the use of metal foam.
Heat transfer coefficient of the thermal energy storage with copper matrix can be
significantly increased up to 28.1 times by heat conduction when the PCM is in the
solid phase, and up to 3.1 times by the combination of natural convection and heat
conduction when the PCM is in the liquid phase. Hence, both the melting and
solidification times are substantially shortened. In addition, it was concluded that
porosity plays a more important role to enhancing the heat transfer efficiency in
thermal energy storage system than pore density.
An increase in aluminium foam metal fraction results in an increase in the effective
thermal conductivity of the composite because only about 2% of the heat flow is
through the PCM, and the interfacial bond resistance decreases due to increased
contact area. The trade-off is a reduced charging time versus a reduced volumetric
latent heat storage due to the increasing aluminium foam metal fraction.
An increase in the heat transfer rate during melting and freezing of the PCM (water).

It was demonstrated that thermal conductivity of the paraffin/nickel foam composite
was nearly three times larger than that of pure paraffin, 0.4 and 1.2 W/mK
respectively.

Fiedler et al. [129] compared a copper and aluminium metal matrix and found that copper matrices achieve approximately an increase of 80% in the effective thermal con-
ductivity compared to aluminium matrices. It was found that a further increase is possible using diamond-coated copper matrices. Xiao et al. [128] and Fiedler et al. [129]
concluded that copper is an acceptable matrix material.

as PCM. Different samples of this composite were evaluated. The
results showed that the highest effective thermal conductivity of
composite PCM was 50.78 W/mK, which was 110 times higher than
that of salt powder. Also, it was concluded that the addition of ENG-
TSA causes a decrease in latent heat, but there is no remarkable
variation in phase change temperature.

3.6. Nanoparticle-encapsulated PCMs

ductivity than aluminium, carbon/copper nanoparticle dispersed
paraffin composite in the same condition showed in Fig. 21.

Additional recent work on nanoparticle PCMs is summarized in
Table 15. The review by Kibria et al. [134] illustrates how dispers-
ing nanoparticles in PCMs enhance the overall heat capacity, whilst
also demonstrating the effects upon the PCM viscosity and
subcooling.

Major areas of concern remain to be clarified.

As illustrated in Table 15, most of the research work in the lit-
erature was conducted on improving the thermal properties of
organic PCMs such as paraffins and fatty acids. Paraffin draws a great
attraction to researchers for its desirable characteristics i.e. good heat
storage density, melting or solidification compatibly with little or
no sub-cooling, being inert to most common chemical reagents and
of low cost. The main drawback of these PCMs is their low thermal
conductivity, hence the growing interest in dispersing high con-
ductive nanoparticles within the PCMs [134]. Wu et al. [146] tested
different metal nanoparticles in order to enhance the thermal con-
ductivity of paraffin wax. The results concluded that Cu/paraffin
composite had a better cooling/heating rate i.e., better thermal con-

• Although the thermal conductivity of the PCM increases with
increase in concentration of nanoparticles, surface modifica-
tion of the nanoparticles might be required. The diameter of the
nanoparticles was shown to have a limited effect only. Mostly
carbon nano-tubes and fibres, graphite and graphene have been
investigated.

• Metal and metal oxide nanoparticles show an enhancement in
thermal conductivity that varies with their shape, size and con-
centrations. The enhancement is also temperature dependent.
• The presence of nanoparticles reduces the solidification and
melting time of the composition. Too high a concentration of
nanoparticles could negatively modify other properties of PCM.

enhance the performance of the system during the charging
(melting) and discharging (solidification) process. In the case of a
single PCM, this temperature difference decreases in the flow di-
rection of HTF, thus leading to a decrease in heat transfer rate and
poor performance of the unit. If multiple PCMs with different melting
temperatures are packed in the unit, in decreasing order of their
melting points, nearly a constant temperature difference can be
maintained during the melting process, even though the temper-
ature of HTF decreases in the flow direction. This leads to an almost
constant heat flux to the PCMs. During discharging, if the flow di-
rection of the HTF is reversed, the PCMs remain in increasing order
of their melting points. A nearly constant heat flux from the PCM
to HTF is maintained [34,147–149].

An example of experimental multiple PCM is shown by Kuravi
et al. [34] the shell side is loaded with different PCMs and synthet-
ic oil is allowed to flow through the inner tube, all PCMs being
arranged in the flow direction (axial direction) in contact with the
HTF.

In solar thermal applications, the PCMs are mostly kept in the
storage tank, which contains the HTF, used as the heat carrier
[150,151]. Since the PCM is surrounded by the HTF, there is no axial
temperature variation within the HTF. In such configurations, mul-
tiple PCMs should be arranged in the radial direction instead of in
the axial direction. With multiple PCM arrangement, it is possible
to have lowest melting point PCM at the centre and other PCMs ar-
ranged in the increasing order of their melting points from the centre
of the unit to the outer wall. This may lead to more or less simul-
taneous melting at all points, because a nearly constant temperature
difference can be maintained in the radial direction.

A similar work, with three coaxial cylindrical tubes to store three
PCMs and the entire unit being kept in water bath, has been re-
ported by Wang et al. [152,153]. The PCMs are arranged in a similar
way as discussed above. The experiments for the charging process
with different HTF temperatures indicate that the melting time in
three PCMs system is decreased by 37–42%, as compared with that
of the single PCM unit, which has been attributed to the fact that
the three PCM unit terminates the melting process earlier by 15–
25%. With multiple phase PCMs, it is possible to produce variable
distribution of phase change temperature [151,152]. In the systems
with constant temperature boundary conditions, the distribution
of a linear phase change temperature can be realized by properly
arranging those PCMs with different melting points. Simulation and
experimental results indicated that a 25% reduction in phase change
time can be achieved by using multiple phase PCMs. It is also found
that the efficiency in the enhancement is dependent on the number
of the PCMs. For practical applications, the number of the PCMs
should be in the range of 5–10 [147,154].

Peiró et al. [155] performed an experimental evaluation of the
advantages of using the multiple PCM configuration instead of the
single PCM configuration in thermal energy storage (TES) systems
at pilot plant to fill the gap of experimental and high scale studies
on this concept in the literature. For the evaluation were selected
two PCM with melting temperatures in the range of 150–200 °C due
to their high value of heat of fusion and compared: d-mannitol and
hydroquinone. Three configurations were evaluated: single PCM
with hydroquinone; single PCM with d-mannitol; and multiple
PCM with hydroquinone and d-mannitol. Results showed that the
multiple PCM configuration introduced an effectiveness enhance-
ment of 19.36% if compared with single PCM configuration as well
as a higher uniformity on the HTF temperature difference between
the inlet and outlet.

In order to improve cascade thermal energy storage, Tian et al.
[156] experimented adding metal foam to the PCM. Exergy effi-
ciency of STES cannot be significantly improved by CTES (15% to ca.
30%), nor by MF-CTES; exergy transfer rate of STES is increased by
CTES (up to 23%), and is further increased by MF-CTES (by 2–7 times).

• Nanoparticles generally reduce the latent heat capacity of PCM.
The determination of the optimum addition of nanoparticles has
to be explored.

• Predicting the thermal conductivity and latent heat capacity of

a nanoparticle-PCM is very difficult.

• Nanoparticles present affect the nucleation and decrease the

super-cooling of the PCM.

• The presence of nanoparticles will moreover significantly in-

crease the viscosity of the PCM-melt.

As far as now, mostly organic nanoparticles have been used. It
is however not excluded to use mineral or metal nanoparticles in
suspension with the HTF. The segregation of these denser par-
ticles from the lighter HTF needs however to be cautiously
investigated.

3.7. Cascades of PCM systems

The use of multiple component PCMs in PCM-TES systems has
been shown as an effective way for the enhancement in their per-
formances [134]. It means that in a system more than one PCM are
used. These PCMs have different melting points. The differences
between the temperatures of HTF and the melting points of the PCMs
have significant effects on the heat transfer rate of the unit and thus

4. Thermo-chemical heat storage

4.1. Principles

One of the most novel approaches to the problem of storing
thermal energy from a solar collection field, or from transforming
excess renewable power (wind turbines, photovoltaics) into heat
[14], is the use of reversible chemical reactions. Unlike sensible or
latent thermal energy storage, mostly limited in time due to heat
losses, chemical energy storage enables to bridge long duration
periods between supply and demand, hence making it particular-
ly suitable for a large scale electricity generation. In such a system,
as outlined in Fig. 22, excess energy is converted into high grade
heat at the absorber containing the reactant during the charging
cycle: the high grade heat is converted into chemical energy by pro-
moting an endothermic reaction whereby reaction products are
either stored for re-use in the reverse reaction, or exhausted. At the
time of energy demand by the central power generation plant or
other users, the high grade heat is regenerated through the reverse
exothermic reaction cycle and is converted into electricity and low
grade heat (CHP concept) through e.g. a standard steam-driven turbo-
alternator or through a heat carrier powered Stirling engine.

A large number of reversible chemical reactions can be used for
thermo-chemical energy storage, each within a given range of equi-
librium temperatures and heats of reaction [157–163]. Table 16
selects some of the possible reaction pairs, within the target tem-
perature range of 300 °C to ±1000 °C. Numerous low temperature
reversible reactions are not included. Clearly, the Mn2O3—MnO pair
does not match the proposed temperature range, but can similar-
ly equivalent to oxides, be used in the reaction of MnO and H2O to
produce H2 [164–168].

The selection of the optimum system for high temperature ap-
plications is governed by both the overall thermodynamic
performance, and by chemical engineering criteria (kinetics, design
factors, etc.) which determine practicability and cost of operation.
In a complete analysis, these factors are normally combined in terms
of global cost-effectiveness, expressed as the levelized cost of elec-
tricity (LCOE), and previously discussed in Section 1. At the present
stage of development, there is a lack of comparative data for such

a complete analysis. It is however important that an early guide as
to the viability of each system is obtained. The present section hence
examines thermodynamic and engineering criteria to provide a sci-
entific comparison among the systems listed before [169,170]. The
analysis will moreover provide guidance as to the important as-
sessment criteria of new candidate reaction systems.

4.2. Thermodynamic assessment

4.2.1. Gibbs’ free energy and work recovery

A reversible reaction system suitable for high temperature energy
storage, and subsequent steam turbine or Stirling engine use for work
recovery, should absorb heat at temperatures below 1000 °C in order
to lessen problems of material limitation and heat losses, and should
furthermore be capable of delivering heat to the turbine inlet at typ-
ically 500–600 °C [168]. As initially presented by Williams and Carden
[171], the thermodynamic criteria for the preliminary screening of
candidate reactions are assessed from available thermodynamic equi-
librium data. Williams and Carden [171] proposed to use two
parameters for the initial screening of reversible reactions. The first
is the “equilibrium” temperature, T*, i.e the temperature at which
neither forward nor reverse reactiions are thermodynamically fa-
voured. T* is derived by applying the definition of Gibbs’ free energy
to the condition of T*.

(
ΔG T* P,

) = 0

(7)

where ΔG is Gibbs’ free energy change for the reaction, i.e.
ΔG = ΔH − TΔS, in this case

with ΔH and ΔS respectively the reaction enthalpy and entropy at
pressure P and temperature T*.

The second screening parameter is the maximum work recov-
ery efficiency, ηw
max, defined as the ratio of the maximum available
or ideal work to the actual work, and obtained from standard chem-
ical thermodynamics [42].

The “lost work” is only zero, when a process is completely re-
versible. For irreversible process, the energy that becomes unavailable
for work is positive, and ~TsΔS. The engineering significance is clear:
the greater the irreversibility of a process, with a greater the rate
of entropy generation corresponding with a greater amount of energy
that becomes unavailable for work.

The maximum work recovery efficiency is hence:

where Ts represents the ambient or the sink temperature. The at-
tainment of the maximum work implies that the endothermic heat
exchange operation must be reversible and complete, whilst also
the exothermic reaction must proceed reversibly. The reaction must

hence proceed so that chemical equilibrium is maintained at all tem-
peratures. All the reaction heat and all heat imbalances in the heat
exchanger must be converted into maximum work by use of a Carnot
cycle available throughout the temperature range. The advantage
of both T* and ηw
max is that they may be estimated to a fair approx-
imation for a given reaction by use of standard reference data alone.

4.2.2. Calculation results

From the calculations, Figs. 23 and 24 illustrate both screening

parameters, T* and ηw
the equilibrium temperature versus the equilibrium pressure for the
different reactions in Table 17. The maximum work efficiency versus
the sink temperature is plotted in Fig. 24.

To make a selection between the reactions, different aspects need
to be taken into consideration. Firstly, the temperature should pref-
erably be as close as possible to 500–900 °C. Secondly a higher
maximum work recovery efficiency is preferred. But also the prac-
tical aspects need to be considered, because adding water vapour
is easier than collecting, storing and injecting carbon dioxide, whilst
O2 reactions are most favourable since air can be the reactant of the
reverse reaction. Oxides and hydroxides are thus favoured above
carbonates.

Fig. 24 shows that the temperature is not very dependent on the
pressure for most of the systems selected except at low partial pres-
sures of the gas/vapour phase, as commonly encountered when a

separate gas carrier is used to exhaust the gas/vapour reaction prod-
ucts. For Mn2O3 the temperature is a more outspoken function of
pressure for all pressures. The work efficiency is rather low for car-
bonates and hydroxides. Oxides provide the higher value of work
efficiency in the selected range of sink temperatures.

4.3. Kinetics from thermogravimetric analysis

Thermogravimetry (TGA) measures the weight of the sample
every second, recording M0, Mt and M∞, at the initial measure-
ment time t0, time t and the time for completing the reaction t∞.
The conversion is calculated as

The reaction rate constant can be derived within the complete
time and/or temperature scale, as described in detail for other chem-
ical process by Brems et al. [172,173].

For example, typical TGA plots for Mg(OH)2 are illustrated in
Fig. 25. The decomposition rate is slightly dependent on the tem-
perature ramp, β. Similar weight loss curves were obtained for all
reaction pairs tested.

Additional TGA plots are illustrated in Figs. 26 and 27 for the re-
versible reactions of Mn2O3 ↔ Mn3O4 and Co3O4 ↔ CoO, respectively.
Clearly, the oxidation reaction is slower than the reduction and
incomplete, assumed to be the results of compaction of the reduced
reaction compound, hence hampering diffusion of O2 during the
reverse reaction [170,174]. This is also illustrated in the BET ad-
sorption curves of Mn2O3 and Mn3O4 (Fig. 28) [170].

A fair approximation of the reaction kinetics is obtained by trans-
forming the TGA data, using the Arrhenius equation of the reaction
rate constant, k:

=

k Aexp

−⎛
E

⎝⎜

⎠⎟

(11)

Plotting ln(k) versus 1/T provides –EA/R as the slope of the linear

fit, and ln(A) as ln(k) at 1/T = 0.

In this equation k is the reaction rate constant; A the pre-
exponential factor with same units as k; Ea the activation energy,
J/mol; R the universal gas constant, 8.314 J/mol K; and T the tem-
perature, K.

The rate of reaction, dα/dt, is a function of the rate constant k
(dependent on temperature) and a function of conversion f(α) (in-
dependent on temperature). This results in:

Different methods were tested to fit the experimental data, i.e.
(i) iso-conversional methods (Friedman, Flynn–Wall–Ozawa and
Kissinger–Akahira–Susone); and (ii) the mechanistic methods based
upon the Coats–Redfern approach, using different expressions for
f(α). The iso-conversional methods do not provide the expected

linearity of the conversion rates expression versus 1/T for various
β-values, resulting in widely different values of the activation
energy with degree of conversion. Within the different f(α) ap-
proach (nucleation, diffusion, reaction order), the expression as a
first order reaction [f(α) = −ln(1 − α)] provides a very fair fit for all
of the reaction pairs tested. The activation energies and pre-
exponential
factors (A) were hence determined by solving
Eq. 13 for the experimental values of α, and using a first order

T > Teq + 100 K:

For the given reversible reactions, the maximum conversion is
given by Eq. 13 above and the reaction stoichiometry. To achieve
99% of the maximum conversion in a first order reaction, Eq. 11 de-
termines the required reaction time above Teq below 300 s for all
of the reactions studied. This is however tentative only, pilot/large
scale experimentation is certainly required.

Recently, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) had been also
testing TCS heat storage materials at laboratory scale. In order to
investigate TCS at a larger scale, a test bench as well as a reactor
containing around 20 kg of reaction material was built and brought
into operation. Due to the good availability at low cost and its
favourable temperature range for CSP plants, previous work at DLR
focused on the reversible dissociation reaction of calcium hydrox-
ide [175–177]:

The dehydration was performed at 450 °C and the rehydration
at about 550 °C. Reversible conversion of 77% of the material with
no degradation effects after 10 cycles was determined.

Within their results they evidenced losses of chemically stored
thermal energy, but they concluded that these could be estimated
by implementing a loss term into their simulation and accounted
for around 2 kW during the first minutes of the reaction. Addition-
ally, the good agreement between experimental and simulated results
showed that the reaction kinetics determined in micro-scale mea-
surements as well as the known bed properties offered a sufficient
representation of the effective conditions within the bed. Anyhow,
research is still needed in order to develop TCS at an industrial level.

The selection of the optimum reaction system for high temper-
ature applications is governed by both the overall thermodynamic
performance, and by chemical engineering criteria (kinetics, design
factors, etc.) which determine practicability and cost of operation.
In a complete analysis, these factors are normally combined in terms
of global cost-effectiveness, expressed as the levelized cost of elec-
tricity (LCOE), as explained in Section 1. At the present stage of
development, there is a lack of comparative data for such a com-
plete analysis. It is however important that an early guide as to the
viability of each system is obtained, and this is provided by ther-
modynamic calculations and kinetic measurements.

From the previous and preliminary assessment, TCS certainly
offers a potential for medium to high temperature heat storage. The
reactions are fast and generally reversible (except Mn2O3 and Co3O4).
The reaction rate itself can be considered as moderate (≤300 s), and
is thereafter not a limiting factor. The heat penetration inside the
chemicals’ packed bed is governed by conduction, where the con-
duction approach of PCM storage, as developed in Section 3.3 (with
or without inserts), will determine the rate of heat penetration, and
hence the overall charging/discharging rate of the TCS system.

Additional pilot-scale experiments with Co3O4 and doped Co3O4
were examined by Tescari et al. [178] and the reaction concepts were
numerically modelled by commercial CFD software. Adding up to
10 wt% of non-reactive oxides to the Co3O4 is shown to prevent con-
solidation and enhance the reversibility of the Co3O4/CoO redox
reaction.

5. Containment of LHS and TCS materials

5.1. Preliminary selection concerns and criteria

5.1.1. Pressure upon phase change or chemical reaction

Phase change materials and thermochemical storage (TCS)
systems certainly offer a significant potential towards thermal energy
storage. Of course, the materials used need to be properly con-
tained in e.g. a spherical capsule, heat exchanger tube or sandwich
plates, or in any other container that meets the required need of
being closed and able to withstand the high temperatures envis-
aged, to resist possible chemical attacks by the contained materials
[179–184], and to resist the pressure build up during the phase
change (expansion for solid to liquid phase) or during the release
of gases and vapours during the thermochemical transformations.
This containment is hereafter referred to as “encapsulation”.

H. Zhang et al./Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 53 (2016) 1–40

27

In most PCM systems, the density of the liquid is 3–5% lower than
the density of the corresponding solid. In thermochemical storage,
gas (CO2, O2) or H2O-vapour are formed, again with a correspond-
ing pressure increase in the encapsulation. This pressure increase
can be significantly higher than in PCMs, and only special mea-
sures such as a pressure relief valve on the encapsulation will be
able to cope with the ΔP.

For PCM or TCS encapsulation, mostly tubular containment will
be applied. A spherical encapsulation, applied by e.g. vapour de-
position or electrolysis is also possible, but with additional problems
of very high pressure build-up on the capsule [51].

For PCM encapsulations, the pressure to be considered can be
calculated as e.g. for a capsule of volume V, filled for ~95% with
molten PCM. After cooling and solidification, the filling volume will
reduce (through contraction) by e.g. 3.1% for Sb2O3 and 4.4% for KNO3
respectively. The tube is then closed by welding a lid onto the cyl-
inder with material-appropriate welding rods, or by a ceramic lid
in the event of using ceramic tubes. The enclosed air will expand
upon heating and re-melting of the PCM.

Since the starting pressure is 1 bar, the internal pressure upon
melting will increase (reducing free volume and increasing tem-
perature) to P2.

The formula for the minimum required wall thickness tm is given
in Eq. 14. For straight metal pipes under internal pressure, this
formula is valid for D0/t ratios larger than 6. The factor Y in this
formula varies with material and temperature. It is used to take the
redistribution of circumferential stress into account: this redistri-
bution occurs under steady-state creep at high temperatures and
permits a slightly lesser thickness at this range.

5.1.2.2. Pressure to deformation and to burst (rupture). The Barlow
formula [183] for the pressure to deformation or to burst is given
in Eq. 15:

The internal pressure on the encapsulation will hence increase
to approximately 5.3 bar for Sb2O3 and 4.2 bar for KNO3. These values
are slightly pessimistic since the expansion of the capsule should
be taken into account (V increases as T increases). In TCS-systems,
such pressure increases are not expected, since a tubular encapsu-
lation will be vented to the atmosphere at 1 bar during the
endothermic reaction, whilst pressures will be set at 1–3 bar during
the exothermic reverse reaction. The mechanical analysis of E-PCMs
is hence also valid for the reversible reaction TCS case.

In the event of a complete encapsulation such as in coated PCM
spheres [51], no air buffer is present, and the capsule material will
need to fully withstand the expansion of the phase change.

5.1.2. Design of the encapsulation

Calculations should focus upon normal design parameters for

straight pipes under internal pressure, to determine:

• minimum required wall thickness
• comparison with Young’s modulus (limit of plastic deforma-

tion) [51]

• pressure to rupture [185]

These calculations are available on Internet calculators, provid-

ed by ASME and engineering companies.

5.1.2.1. Wall thickness. When the wall thickness to withstand an in-
ternal pressure is used as a design parameter, it requires that the
relief-valve setting may not be higher than the design pressure. For
piping, the chosen design pressure and temperature are the
maximum intended operating pressure and the coincident tem-
perature combination. This results in the maximum wall thickness.
The allowable stresses for possible capsule materials will be given
in Section 5.2.

φ = safety factor: calculations commonly use 1 as safety factor

5.1.2.3. Young’s modulus. Young’s modulus (tensile modulus or elastic
modulus) characterizes the material and is the stiffness of an elastic
material. The definition of Young’s modulus is the ratio between
the stress along an axis, and the strain along that axis in the range
of stress in which Hooke’s law is valid. The strain is defined as the
ratio of deformation over the initial length. Eq. 16 shows the def-
inition of Young’s modulus.

When a material has high Young’s modulus, it is rigid. It is im-
portant to not confuse rigidity with strength, stiffness, hardness or
toughness. The difference between rigidity and stiffness is that ri-
gidity characterizes the material (intensive property), the stiffness
looks to products and construction (extensive property). The hard-
ness of a material is the relative resistance of its surface to the
penetration of a harder body. Toughness is the amount of energy
that can be absorbed by the material before fracturing when sub-
jected to strain. Young’s modulus indicates e.g. how much a sample
extends under tension or shortens under compression. Young’s
modulus is directly applicable to uni-axial stresses, these are tensile

It is clear that only AISI 310 (to 700 °C), AISI 321, Incoloy 825, Inconel 600 and ceramic tubes (to 900 °C) meet the required general properties at temperatures in excess of
600 °C. In addition to these properties, several thermal and mechanical properties will determine the final selection, together with the mechanical calculations of the ge-
ometry of the tubular encapsulation.

directions.

5.1.3. Preliminary selection criteria

In view of the concerns of operating temperature, thermal cycling
between charging and discharging, possible oxidation by air or chem-
ical attacks by the PCM or TCS reactants, the selection is rather
limited and illustrated in Table 19.

5.2. Relevant properties of E-materials

Since extensive properties are provided in standard handbooks
or websites of suppliers [187–189], or by the American Iron and Steel
Corporation [190], only essential properties are summarized here-
after; with an example more detailed description for INCONEL® alloy
600.

5.2.1. INCONEL alloy 600 [187]

INCONEL® alloy 600 is an engineering material with excellent
mechanical properties, high strength and good workability. It is used
for applications which require resistance to corrosion and heat. The
high nickel content makes INCONEL alloy 600 resistant to corro-
sion by organic and inorganic compounds and to chloride-ion stress-
corrosion cracking. Chromium makes the alloy resistant to sulphur
compounds and to oxidizing conditions at high temperatures or in
corrosive solutions. INCONEL alloy 600 is used in a variety of ap-
plications with temperatures from cryogenic to above 1095 °C.
Mechanical properties are listed in Table 20 for tubes. The yield
strength is between 170 and 345 MPa, the yield strength together
with elongations of 35–55% [187] makes the alloy easy to fabricate.
Fig. 29 shows the high-temperature tensile properties of an an-
nealed (870 °C/1 hr) hot-rolled plate. Data for other materials are
also included.

Although both INCONEL alloy 600 and Incoloy 825 are applica-
ble at temperatures beyond ~700 °C, the mechanical properties
decrease significantly with increasing temperature.

Fig. 30 presents the rupture life of hot-rolled material at tem-
peratures of 538–1093 °C, and demonstrates that the applicable stress
decreases with temperature and duration of use.

INCONEL alloy 600 with a minimum nickel content of 72% is vir-
tually immune to chloride-ion stress-corrosion cracking. Stress-
corrosion problems occur in INCONEL alloy 600 in high-temperature,
high-strength caustic alkalis. In this case the material should be
stress-relieved at 900 °C/1 hr or 790 °C/4 hr prior to use and oper-
ating stresses should be kept to a minimum. Fig. 31 shows the alloy’s
resistance to oxidation and scaling at 980 °C, with other potential
alloys included. This figure was obtained from weight-loss deter-
minations which indicate the ability of a material to retain a
protective oxide coating under conditions of cyclic exposure to the
temperature. INCONEL alloy 600 offers the best long term oxida-
tion resistance.

When the machinability of INCONEL alloy 600 is compared with
stainless steel, it is slightly more machinable than Type 304 and
slightly less machinable than Type 303. The joining of INCONEL alloy
600 is done by conventional welding processes, using specific elec-
trodes and either shielded metal-arc, gas tungsten-arc and gas metal-
arc, or submerged-arc welding.

5.2.2. Incoloy 825 [191]

Similar to Inconel alloy 600, Incoloy® alloy 825 is a Ni—Fe—Cr
alloy with excellent thermal properties and corrosion resistance. The
presence of molybdenum and copper enhances the resistance to a
reducing atmosphere and to pitting and crevice corrosion.

The addition of chromium confers resistance to different oxi-
dizing substances such as nitric acid, nitrates and oxidizing salt. The
addition of titanium, in combination with an appropriate heat treat-
ment, stabilizes the alloy against sensitization to intergranular
corrosion.

Physical and mechanical properties are discussed in literature
[190,191]. INCOLOY alloy 825 has good mechanical properties from
cryogenic temperatures to moderately high temperatures. When the
temperature exceeds 540 °C, microstructural changes (phase for-
mation) can occur which lower ductility and impact strength. So
at temperatures where creep-rupture properties are design factors,
the alloy is not used. Some tensile properties of INCOLOY alloy 825
are given in Table 21: the alloy can be strengthened significantly
by cold work.

Fig. 29 showed the high-temperature tensile properties and in-
dicated the typical usage range. The ultimate tensile strength of the
material was found to be 720 MPa. The alloy has good impact
strength at room temperature and retains its strength at high
temperatures.

5.2.3. Extruded tubular ceramics [192–196]

Ceramic materials are far less documented than their steel coun-
terparts. In tubular ceramics, mostly alumina and its composites,
zirconia, SiC and SiN are used. The alumina ceramics are recog-
nized for their ease of production and moderate costs, although still
between 4 and 5 times the cost of their steel equivalents. Some es-
sential parameters are given in Table 22.

To seal the ceramic heat exchanger tube after having been filled
with PCM or TCS materials, different options are offered by ceramic
specialists, including tungsten carbide, or silicon carbide or graph-
ite seals [196–198]. For less demanding applications, steel hardware
(clamps, clips, etc.) are proposed, e.g. Ref. 199.

subjected to pull and press experiments, and pressures to defor-
mation and to rupture were measured and given in Table 23. Clearly,
the pressure required to deform or burst the tested encapsula-
tions significantly exceeds the pressure generated during the phase
change (~5 bar = 0.5 MPa). Moreover, the KNO3 tube of larger di-
ameter and thickness performs better, with a lower reduction in
pressure after multiple cycling. These results are however in line
with the theoretical predictions, as shown below.

The minimum required wall thickness at the maximum oper-
ating temperature is calculated according to Eq. 14. The pressure
to deformation and rupture is calculated according to the Barlow
formula, Eq. 15. The maximum intended operating pressure P is
3 bar; the outside diameter for cylinder 1 and 2 is respectively 39 mm
and 27.6 mm. The allowable stress SE (yield strength) at 650 °C for
AISI 321 is 250 MPa. The coefficient Y is 0.4 because the material
is nonferrous and the factor C is taken as 0.01 mm, which is a pes-
simistic estimation. The minimum required wall thickness for the
two cylinders and the selected materials is summarized in Table 24.
A commercial wall thickness of 1.5 or 2 mm provides a large excess
wall thickness.

For the pressure to deformation, S is the yield strength at 650 °C,
this is the same as SE in the calculation for the minimum required
wall thickness, and the safety factor φ is 1.5. To calculate the pres-
sure to rupture, S is the tensile strength and the safety factor is 1.
The results of the calculations for the pressure to deformation and
rupture are given in Table 25. Clearly, experimental values are about
10–20% below the theoretical predictions, so the pressure equa-
tions can hence be used. For high numbers of cycles, the design
pressure should however be increased by 10 to conservatively 20%.
Form the above data and experimental treatment, it emerges that
the proper properties of the encapsulation materials as given in spe-
cialized references provide a very fair basis for design calculations.
Yield strength, tensile strength, and time-dependent creep strength
are the most important properties that enable to assess required
wall thickness and allowable pressures to deformation and rupture.
Thermal cycling of E-PCM sample tubes has demonstrated that the

calculated required wall thickness is far below the standard thick-
nesses of commercial tubes. Predicted and experimental pressures
to deformation and rupture are in very fair agreement. Further ex-
perimental confirmation is however required.

6. PCM/TCS integration in TES requires heat carriers

6.1. Introduction

TES generally requires the use of a heat transfer fluid during the
charging and discharging processes. Although water/steam, gas, syn-
thetic oils and others can be used, current HTFs are commonly
molten salts, when large-scale heat storage is included, however with
drawbacks of temperature limitation required heat tracing of the
molten salt circuits, and high pumping power requirements. The
maximum temperature for the application of thermal fluids is
between 350 and 400 °C, whilst molten salt applications are limited
to ~560 °C.

Molten salts are mostly nitrates, such as solar salt (NaNO3/
KNO3) or Hitec® (NaNO2/NaNO3/KNO3), with an upper temperature
limit of ~600 °C for solar salt, and a lower temperature limit through
solidification at 230 and 140 °C respectively. The molten salts have
a low vapour pressure, but their moderate viscosity as a function
of temperature leads to considerable pumping energy. The insta-
bility of the molten salts should be carefully considered, with e.g.

As a result of these instabilities, physical properties (μ, ρ, etc.)
will change and environmental issues should be taken into con-
sideration (e.g. emissions through pressure venting of the formed
gases), whilst plugging problems might occur.

Recently, the use of particle suspensions as HTF has been ad-
vocated. Since the particle suspension has a heat capacity similar
to that of molten salts, without temperature limitation except for
the maximum allowable wall temperature of the receiver tube, sus-
pension temperatures of up to 800 °C can be tolerated for refractory
steel tubes (even higher when using ceramic or glass tubes), thus
offering new opportunities for highly efficient thermodynamic cycles
such as obtained when using supercritical steam or CO2, as previ-
ously illustrated in Fig. 6. Despite the pre-cited advantages of using
circulating particles as HTF, multiple questions need to be investi-
gated concerning powder stability (attrition); equipment erosion;
or the overall economy of the system when the receiver tempera-
ture is increased, leading to increased power cycle efficiency,
increased storage density, reduced thermal power requirements, and
increased plant capacity factor.

6.2. Powders as novel heat carriers in renewable energy systems

A novel application of powders in renewable energy relies on
their use as heat transfer medium for heat capture, conveying and
storage. Gas, mostly air, but possibly inert gas such as N2, is used
as powder carrying medium. According to the gas velocity applied,
different gas–solid concepts are possible. With increasing gas flow
rate, the operation moves from a fixed bed to a bubbling fluidized
or ultimately circulating fluidized bed and pneumatic conveying
[201]. Without, or with a limited gas flow, falling particle reactors
or mechanical conveying could be used. Whereas powder reactors
in chemical applications mostly use Geldart A or B powders as bed
material [202], HTF applications will mostly use A-type powders
in order to limit the required gas flow rate and associated sensible

heat losses. Fig. 32 illustrates the different operation modes of solid–
gas systems, with representative values of the major characteristic
transition velocities given in Table 26.

Compared to the moving bed concept, introducing relative par-
ticle movement improves the heat transfer and gas/solid mixing,
but abrasion, erosion and particle elutriation increase with increas-
ing gas velocity. Bubbling fluidized beds (BFB) and BFB with induced
solids circulation (UBFB), operating with A-powders and at low U,
provide an excellent balance between heat transfer rates and par-
ticle stability.

Falling particle reactors have poor heat transfer and particle sta-
bility could be critical. The heat capturing capacity of the solids is
low per unit reactor length. Circulating fluidized bed (CFB) systems
offer the advantage of operating at high solid circulation fluxes,
(>>500 kg/m2 s), thus being capable of conveying significant amounts
of heat. The somewhat lower heat transfer coefficient than in BFB
and UBFB, and higher risk of abrasion and attrition are drawbacks.
The application of a higher value of U will moreover necessitate

appropriate de-dusting equipment and heat recovery on the exhaust
gas. The application of CFB seems hence limited to very large storage
and re-use capacities. The rotary drum and screw conveyer can offer
advantages for heat storage, but can be excluded as heat capture
option due to the low heat transfer rate achieved. Among the dif-
ferent concepts, the UBFB (low to moderate CSP capacities) and CFB
(large capacities) are recommended.

The BFB, CFB and moving bed concepts can however be applied
in the TES and thermal block of the plant, with some tentative il-
lustrations are given in Fig. 33 and Fig. 34 as example applications.
The excellent heat transfer characteristics of powder beds more-
over facilitate the integration of E-PCM, as temporary heat storage
medium. The loop of Fig. 33 is generally composed of a hot storage
silo fed from the discharge of the heat or energy receiver, and feeding
a fluid bed heat exchanger, where the particles transmit their energy
to submerged tubes inside whose a working fluid (for example
steam) is generated and further expanded in a turbine: the fluid bed
heat exchanger is a common device in the electrical power indus-
try (mostly implemented for coal and biomass combustion in
fluidized beds).

The cooled particles exit the boiler (continuous circulation) and
are returned towards the cold storage tank by mechanical convey-
ing. Finally, a conveying system raises the particles from the cold
silo to the heat receiver inlet. Particles are used as heat transfer fluid
and heat storage medium, possibly complemented by using an
E-PCM.

The loop of Fig. 34 includes the same unit components. Heat is
supplied to the hot-side of the Stirling engine in a BFB of the par-
ticle heat carrier.

6.2.1. Dense up-flow of particles

Literature concerning dense up-flow systems, with forced up-
flow and bubble-induced mixing is scarce. Initial research mostly
covered moving packed beds. Fluidized bed up-flow reactors were
described by several researchers. The dense up-flow column is fed
at its bottom by a circulation flow of solids at an appropriate pres-
sure to overcome the pressure drop of the upwards-moving bed of
solids. The column itself is either aerated from the windbox [3,7]
or by a combined windbox aeration and additional aeration at the
bottom of the riser column itself [21,28].

6.2.2. Particle loops in SPT and CSP applications

Since the particle solar receiver is the key component, previ-
ous investigations in the field of solar receivers using particles as
HTF are dealt with in Table 27. Tubular absorbers are generally pro-
posed for use in current solar thermal receivers. The first studies
on direct absorption solar receivers started in the early 1980s with
three concepts, the fluidized bed receiver [208], the free falling par-
ticle receiver [209] and the rotary kiln receiver [210,211].

In the free falling particles concept, the solids are dropped di-
rectly into the concentrated solar beam from the top of the receiver
and are heated during their pass through the concentrated solar ra-
diation. The principle was validated by on-sun experiments at pilot
scale [212]. A receiver prototype was tested at the National Solar
Thermal Test Facility (NSTTF) in Albuquerque NM, USA. Short batch
runs were performed for a total particle inventory of about 1800 kg.
The receiver efficiency generally increased with the particle flow
rate and varied from about 35% to 52%, thus in good agreement with
simulated data. A review of the falling particle receiver was pro-
posed by Tan and Chen [213]. CNRS (FR) developed a “sand heater
loop” using sand particles as HTF [211]: it combined a solar rotary
kiln that delivered hot sand to a heat storage/heat recovery sub-
system consisting of a hot and a cold heat storage bin and a
multistage fluidized heat exchanger.

The air jet flow concept of Röger et al. [214] used falling par-
ticles that line the inner wall of a cylinder closed at its top, whilst

the bottom part was facing the concentrated solar beam. Heat re-
covery from the hot storage is then possible using fluidized bed heat
exchangers as described by Warerkar et al. [215], or by moving bed
particle-air heat exchangers tested by Al-Ansary et al. [216]. In the
former study, storage bins are integrated at the top of the tower.
Direct and indirect absorption particulate receivers were dis-
cussed in detail by Zhang et al. [28]. Indirect receivers operate at
lower flux density in the range 200–400 kW/m2, but offer a better
control of particle circulation within the receiver and a possible man-
agement of operating pressure and heat losses.

The particle mass flow rate inside the solar receiver is one of the
main issues for a high power solar concentrating system using par-
ticles as HTF. In industry, BFB and CFB are widely used at large scale
in oil refineries and in combustors [217,218]: the dense phase flu-
idized bed can be used in standpipes to provide an important and
steady downward flow of solid as shown by Bodin et al. [219], Smol-
ders et al. [220], and Chan et al. [221]. In this regime, the suspension
is uniform, it has a low voidage, and it circulates slowly (a few cm/
s), thus limiting both the energy consumption and its use as HTF.
Novel concepts use a dense suspension of small size solid par-
ticles, patented by Flamant and Hemati [222], and are currently
developed in the framework of both a French National and a Eu-
ropean project [30]: they involve a dense particle upflow suspension
receiver (solid fraction in the range 30–40%) in vertical absorbing
tubes submitted to concentrated solar energy.

6.2.3. Recent experimental results

Recent experimental investigations of using a particulate HTF
were presented by Flamant et al. [21] and Zhang et al. [28], where
the concept of using UBFB and BFB particle suspension carriers was
tested at the solar receiver of Font Romeu (F). The selected par-
ticles were 64 μm silicon carbide (3120 kg/m3), conveyed in a single
tube at air velocities between 0.03 and 0.22 m/s, achieving powder
circulation fluxes between 8 and 50 kg/m2s. The tube wall temper-
ature reached up to ~800 °C.

The experimental results of the heat transfer coefficient, HTC,
against solid flux and for all values of operating gas velocity are il-
lustrated in Fig. 35. The heat transfer coefficient is a clear function
of G. Values of HTC range from >430 W/m2 K to 1120 W/m2 K. These
measured values include both the contribution of particle convec-
tion and radiation at higher temperatures. The radiation contribution
can be separately assessed from the Stefan–Boltzmann equation and
ranges from ~30 W/m2 K at low wall and bed temperature, to 200 W/
m2 K for high temperatures [28].

CFB experiments were also carried out and were partly re-
ported by Zhang et al. [231]. Solids circulation was achieved via a
downcomer and L-valve. Heat supply was by hot water or thermal
fluid (Santotherm 350). The downcomer was water-cooled through
a 0.2 m long concentric cooler.

Temperatures were measured and recorded (wall, different lo-
cations in the CFB, feeding and overflow lines of the fluid). The HTC
was calculated from the known exposed surface area, Aex, the mea-
sured temperature difference, ΔT, and heat input, Q. The bed material
used was rounded sand of 75 μm, 2260 kg/m3, and Cps = 1.05 kJ/
kg K. Various combined (U,G) values were tested to scan the different
riser hydrodynamic regimes (dilute flow, core/annulus flow, dense
flow): G was varied from 8 to ~500 kg/m2 s and U – UTR from 1 to
18 m/s (with U, the superficial gas velocity, and UTR, the required
onset superficial gas velocity for CFB riser flow).

The HTC varied from ~20 W/m2 K (G = 0) to ~400 W/m2 K
(G = 500 kg/m2 s). If a higher temperature would have been used (wall
temperature >600 °C), the radiation contribution should have in-
creased the measured HTC. The required superficial gas velocity in
a CFB (>>3 m/s) significantly exceeds the low value in the UBFB
(~0.1 m/s).

At equivalent values of the specific heat of molten salts and
powders, and with a lower powder temperature after heat recov-
ery (~150 °C against ~300 °C for molten salts), the higher receiver
temperatures of the powders reduce the storage requirement on a
mass basis by ~50%, however only about 30% on a volumetric basis,
due to the lower bulk density of the powder bed. Parasitic power
consumption is also significantly reduced due to the reduced
pumping energy, and lack of heat tracing of the circuits. The com-
bination of these technological advantages will considerably reduce
the LCOE of the SPT concept. The dense particle suspension is a
promising option, justifying additional testing (e.g. using multiple
receiver tubes), and allowing a more correct analysis of economic
advantages in both operating and investment costs, as tentatively
proposed in Table 28. A multi-tube receiver (16 parallel tubes) has
been studied within the CSP2 project [27] at the CNRS 1MW solar
furnace, and results are presented in a separate paper.

7. Conclusion and recommendation for priority research

This work reviewed some recent developments and design rec-
ommendations for the high temperature heat storage, where
sensible/latent/reaction heat each offers a contribution with re-
versible reactions being the most effective (heat storage >>1000 kJ/
kg), followed by latent heat storage (500–1000 kJ/kg) and sensible
heat storage materials (<500 kJ/kg). This is dealt with in Section 1
of the paper.

Section 2 of the paper specifically dealt with sensible heat storage.
Sensible heat storage materials are well-documented, have the lowest
cost materials but at the same time the lowest storage capacity com-
pared to PCM and TCS. Most commonly used minerals’ costs range
from 0.05 €/kg to 0.1 €/kg, hence cheaper than latent heat storage
costs sensible heat materials have excellent thermal conductivi-
ties: 1.0 W/mK–7.0 W/mK for sand-rock minerals, concrete and
firebricks, 37.0 W/mK–40.0 W/mK for ferroalloys. Their disadvan-
tage is their heat capacity, ranging from 0.56 kJ/kg K to 1.3 kJ/kg K,
making storage unit sizes to be bigger than when using latent heat.
The energy stored by a SHS material towards variations of 1 °C in
its temperature can be 100 times lower compared to the energy
storage capacity when it has a phase change, as can be noticed in

Fig. 35. Experimental values of the heat transfer coefficient, HTC, vs. G, for all ex-
perimental superficial gas velocities.

The studies confirmed that upflowing particles can be used in
the novel design of a solar receiver, both in UBFB and CFB mode.
UBFB heat transfer coefficients up to 1100 W/m2 K were obtained
for operation at low superficial gas velocities, thus limiting sensi-
ble heat losses by the exhaust air. Although CFBs could be interesting
for large scale operations, due to the higher solid flux achieved, the
comparison of Table 28 tentatively illustrates the main advan-
tages of using the UBFB principle, even for high receiver capacities.
This selection accounts for sizes, complexity and operating costs.
The high heat transfer coefficient obtained within a given range
of superficial gas velocities, U and solid flux, G, and the possible op-
eration of the powder upflow bed at high temperatures (>750 °C)
moreover offers new opportunities for high efficiency thermody-
namic cycles, with a conversion increase from the current 40% to
over 46% (leading to a reduction of the receiver and heliostat
requirements).

The UBFB application results in lower heat losses, but a slightly higher pressure drop. Towards the number of parallel receiver tubes, the CFB is more advantageous. The
conveying of the powders from the cold storage to the feeding system of the receiver is supposed to be operated by mechanical conveying (as a series of bucket elevators).
Further scale-up work is required to confirm the tentative economic and design assessment.

different materials is illustrated when used as SHS (in their liquid
state) and LHS (when they change from solid to liquid).

Section 3 dealt with latent heat storage, specifically towards high
temperature application, where inorganic substances offer a high
potential. Experimental and modeling data will be compared. Since
inorganic solid/liquid phase change materials suffer from a low
thermal conductivity, conductive inserts offer a high potential, re-
ducing the charging/discharging time by a factor of ~2.

Section 4 reviewed the fundamentals of using reversible chem-
ical reactions to store heat for short to long term storage. Within
the selected reaction pairs, Ca(OH)2, CaCO3, Co3O4 and Mn2O3 offer
a high potential, both towards achieved reaction temperature and
reversibility. All reactions can be treated as first order chemical re-
actions, with activation energies between 50 and 250 kJ/mol and
reaction rate constants of 1 to 2 × 10−3 s−1 at reaction equilibrium
temperature.

Since latent and thermal chemical storage medium needs to be
contained in a capsule (sphere, tube, sandwich plates) of appro-
priate materials, Section 5 assessed the mechanical strength of the
containment from both a theoretical and experimental evalua-
tion. Alloy-capsules of 1–2 mm thickness meet the requirements of
long term stability, even after charging/discharging cycles.

Section 6 specifically dealt with a novel particulate HTF, con-
sidered for both heat capture and storage. Since particulate
suspensions deal with sensible heat storage, the paper reviews pre-
vious investigation and recent experimental results. Literature and
experimental data confirm the high heat transfer coefficient achieved
(>400 W/m2 K in circulating fluidized beds, to >1100 W/m2 K in a
dense upflow fluidized bed).

A tentative technical and economic assessment demonstrates that
particulate suspensions lead to major savings in investment and op-
erating costs.

Although sufficient fundamental and practical information on
SHS/LHS and TCS is available in literature, the achievement of a high
efficiency TES needs to be proven, preferably on pilot or large scale.
These requirements, subjects of additionally required research,
include (i) a high energy density in the storage material (storage
capacity); (ii) a high heat transfer between the HTF and the con-
tained storage media; (iii) a chemical and mechanical stability of
the storage materials used during extensive cycles; (iv) the com-
patibility between HTF, storage medium and heat exchanger; (v) the
complete reversibility of the charging/discharging cycles; (vi) working
at low thermal losses; (vi) ease of control, operation, and integra-
tion into the proposed heat storage concept; and (vii) operation at
as high a temperature as possible.

According to the analysis, specific priority research targets should
include (i) the further development and testing of PCMs and their
charging/discharging enhancement techniques; (ii) the proof of
concept of using nanoparticle-encapsulated PCMs; (iii) the further
development and large-scale confirmation of TCS storage tech-
niques, with special emphasis on the complete reversibility of the
endothermic/exothermic cycling; (iv) the large scale testing of ap-
propriate PCM/TCS containments; (v) the further development of
particle suspension HTFs, possibly even using TCS powders in a cycle
between a reducing (charging) and oxidation (discharging) atmo-

sphere; and (vi) finally, exergy and energy analyses should be
conducted to optimize a storage module: entropy generation anal-
ysis is specifically important in optimizing design and operation
parameters of the systems.
