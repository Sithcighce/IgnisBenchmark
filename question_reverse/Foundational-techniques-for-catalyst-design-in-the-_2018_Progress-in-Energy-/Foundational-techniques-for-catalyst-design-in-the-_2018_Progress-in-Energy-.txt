Catalyst design

The production of fuels and chemicals from renewable lignocellulosic biomass resources has been a major
research focus in the last few decades. The most efficient method for synthesizing value-added chemical
products from sustainable feedstocks is direct catalytic conversion, however, the multifunctional and highly
oxygenated biomass-derived substrates are significantly different from petroleum-based feedstocks. Thus,
systematic development of new catalytic materials is required to take advantage of the only substantial
source of renewable carbon. In this review, we discuss the foundational methodologies that enable rational
catalyst design through the investigation of surface-adsorbate interactions and the elucidation of descrip-
tors for selectivity control. Molecular spectroscopies, efficient and predictive computational modeling, rig-
orous kinetic investigations, and highly controlled materials synthesis have generated fundamental insights
leading to general catalyst design principles in biomass upgrading processes. The application of each tech-
nique in biomass research is discussed in the context of several case studies, with a focus on the unique
insights available from each technique. Moreover, the interplay among multiple techniques, particularly
between experimental and computational methods, is also highlighted. Despite the impressive progress
made in the biomass field, major roadblocks still exist due to the complexity in the composition and struc-
ture of both substrates and catalysts. We share our perspectives regarding future needs in selective catalytic
conversions of multifunctional substrates and methods for accelerating catalyst development.

1. Introduction

PMotivated by concerns about anthropogenic climate change,
major advances have been made in the last decade-plus toward the
synthesis of fuels and commodity chemicals from non-edible ligno-
cellulosic biomass, which is the only substantial source of renewable
carbon [1(cid:1)14]. Abundant and transportable petroleum-derived
hydrocarbons have been used to synthesize fuels and chemicals for
the last century, and heterogeneous catalytic research has histori-
cally been performed in the context of upgrading these fossil carbon
resources [15(cid:1)19]. Industrial processes and catalytic materials that
efficiently mediate the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons have
been established and improved over decades to synthesize partially
oxidized platform chemicals and monomers [20(cid:1)22]. Replacing pol-
luting fossil carbons with renewable biomass-based raw materials
entails the development of new production methods that account
for the substantial differences in the chemical composition between
the two types of feedstocks (particularly the oxygen content, which
is 0.05(cid:1)1.5 wt% in fossil hydrocarbons vs. 30(cid:1)50 wt% in biomass
feedstocks), and the resulting contrasts in physicochemical proper-
ties such as thermal stability and polarity [16,23(cid:1)25]. Selective
reduction and deoxygenation, rather than oxidation, are required for
the synthesis of drop-in platform chemical substitutes from biomass
feedstocks [3,9,10,26,27]. Efficient heterogeneous catalysis is neces-
sary to upgrade biomass on the industrial scale, but new fundamen-
tal understanding is first required to develop the novel catalytic
materials and systems that will facilitate renewable chemicals pro-
duction [7,14,26,28(cid:1)33]. In this review, we discuss the application
of key research strategies used to gain molecular-level insights into
the catalytic chemistry of biomass valorization, and how those
insights are applied to the design of active, selective, and durable
catalysts (Fig. 1.1).

PWhile multiple strategies have been proposed for upgrading bio-
mass resources to fuels and specialty chemicals, direct catalytic
transformation is the most promising approach because it has the
potential to meet the stringent technical, economic, and sustainabil-
ity targets [9,13,14,28,34(cid:1)37]. Lignocellulosic biomass has three
main constituent parts: hemicellulose (25(cid:1)35 wt%) and cellulose
(40(cid:1)50 wt%) are composed of polymerized sugars, and lignin
(15(cid:1)20 wt%) is an amorphous polymer consisting of methoxylated
phenylpropane units [1,2,23,38,39]. Early valorization proposals
focused on complete gasification or pyrolysis of raw biomass to pro-
duce syngas for established petrochemical processes such as the
Fischer(cid:1)Tropsch and the alcohol synthesis processes [40(cid:1)46]. This

Papproach deconstructs the starting material through complete C(cid:1)H
and C(cid:1)C bond cleavage followed by inefficient molecular-level reas-
sembling of the most basic building blocks (synthesis gas) in capital-
intensive chemical plants. Due to high transportation costs, widely
distributed biomass resources are not well-suited to the centralized
processing required for upgrading through gasification and pyroly-
sis. These processes also destroy the potentially valuable structural
units of lignocellulose [3,36,37,47(cid:1)49]. By contrast, direct catalytic
transformations utilize these molecular building blocks to synthe-
size value-added chemicals and monomers, and can be performed in
a modular and distributed manner [1,9,24,50]. Upstream processing
steps such as fractionation and depolymerization are applied to
generate a variety of oxygenated platform molecules, e.g., short-
chain polyols/carboxylic acids, substituted furanics, and phenolics
[6,51(cid:1)55]. These multifunctional molecules can be converted to
polymer precursors such as alkylated furans, aromatics, and
a,v-diols through selective hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) and/or
dehydration, accompanied by hydrogenation, hydrogenolysis, cyclo-
addition, or isomerization steps as needed to attain the final product
[3,12,27,32,56(cid:1)58]. This review focuses on these downstream trans-
formations, particularly the challenges of upgrading multifunctional
molecules, as well as developing multifunctional catalytic materials
that enable these processes.

PThe most significant challenge in direct conversions of multifunc-
tional biomass-derived platform molecules is selectivity control.
Selectivities for critical reactions have substantially improved in
recent years as a direct result of improved mechanistic understand-
ing. Targeting specific functional groups in multifunctional mole-
cules for reduction or deoxygenation typically requires catalysts
with tailored combinations of active sites [27,31,50,59(cid:1)63]. The
complexity of these materials poses challenges in establishing clear
structure-activity relations and gaining insight into reaction mecha-
nisms, both of which are prerequisites for catalyst design. Rather
than a comprehensive review of the biomass upgrading field, this
article aims to provide the authors’ perspective on the central meth-
odologies utilized in mechanistic investigations of biomass-to-
chemicals reactions, and how the insights gained aid in the rational
development of active, selective, and durable catalysts for upgrading
biomass-derived feedstocks. We focus on the application of: (1)
spectroscopic techniques; (2) multi-scale computational methods;
(3) rigorous kinetic investigations; and (4) controlled materials syn-
thesis methods (Fig. 1.1). Readers interested in more general surveys
of biomass conversion are referred to recent review articles
[10,12,13,27,31,32,49,55,56,64(cid:1)69].

Fig. 1.1. Overview of foundational techniques used to investigate catalytic biomass upgrading.

PA common theme of the case studies included in this review is
the use of a technique or approach to obtain unique insights that are
difficult to acquire otherwise. Comprehensive mechanistic under-
standing of a particularly system usually requires a combination of
complementary techniques because a specific technique, however
powerful it may be, only reveals one or a few aspects of the process.
A long-sought goal in the catalysis community is to have predictive
computational models that efficiently survey a broad parameter
space to identify promising materials or systems for more detailed
experimental study. With more powerful hardware and efficient
algorithms than were previously available, such models are being
actively pursued. Meanwhile, accurate and efficient models must be
calibrated and trained with reliable experimental data and appropri-
ate catalyst structure information, especially in the case of semi-
empirical methods. Thus, intimate interplays between computa-
tional and experimental investigations are needed, which will be
reflected in the discussion of case studies as a crosscutting trend.
Through discussions of specific techniques and reaction mechanisms
in case studies, this contribution aims to elucidate general themes in
the rational design of selective catalysts for biomass valorization,
including: (1) designing multifunctional catalytic surfaces, with
atomically mixed active sites mediating tandem reactions; (2) tun-
ing surface site functionalities, by either modifying the composition/
structure of the active sites or introducing strongly adsorbed spe-
cies; and (3) tailoring the binding of targeted functional groups on
the surface. As this review is focused on the technical advances and

Pchallenges of the design, synthesis, characterization and evaluation
of catalytic systems, recent progress on the economic and process
intensification aspects of biomass upgrading will not be covered in
detail [59,63,68,70(cid:1)77].

2. Spectroscopic techniques

PSpectroscopic techniques, especially those conducted under in
situ or operando conditions, can yield unparalleled molecular-level
information regarding the interactions of reactants and intermedi-
ates with the catalyst surface [78,79]. The compositional and struc-
tural complexity of both the catalyst and substrate in biomass
reactions makes spectroscopic insights particularly helpful in estab-
lishing structure-activity relations [80(cid:1)83]. Spectroscopic techni-
ques are generally underutilized in biomass research, which is
attributable at least in part to technical barriers of probing surface-
adsorbate interactions
in liquid or biphasic reaction media
[27,84(cid:1)87]. Ex situ characterizations of surface site functionality and
density with probe molecules, e.g., adsorption of pyridine and
CD3CN for acid sites, pyrrole for base sites, and CO for metal sites,
are common and can be useful, but in situ and operando methods
lead to more consequential insights by directly correlating the state
of the catalyst under working conditions with its performance
[78,85,88(cid:1)94]. In particular, vibrational spectroscopies capable of
providing molecular signatures of adsorbed reaction intermediates,
e.g., high-resolution electron energy loss (HREEL) and Fourier-

PTransform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopies have contributed substan-
tial mechanistic insights into deoxygenation chemistry. These meth-
ods, and particularly the interpretation of spectroscopic data to
elucidate reaction mechanisms, will be the focus of this section. A
variety of other spectroscopic techniques, including Raman spectros-
copy [95(cid:1)99], X-ray absorption spectroscopy [100(cid:1)104], and solid
state nuclear magnetic resonance [105(cid:1)109], have also been
employed in biomass upgrading research and will be discussed
briefly. Recent liquid-phase applications are also discussed due to
their general relevance to biomass upgrading, along with the techni-
cal challenges encountered when probing reactions in the con-
densed phase.

2.1. Spectroscopic investigations of reactions at solid-gas interfaces

PSpectroscopic observations of solid-gas interfaces have provided
insights into key factors governing selectivity control in biomass-to-
chemicals upgrading reactions, including how surface functionality
guides adsorption behavior and the formation of critical intermedi-
ates. Catalytic reactions at solid-gas interfaces are the most accessible
for spectroscopic investigations because carrier gases are generally
spectroscopically invisible and interference from non-adsorbed spe-
cies can be mitigated, e.g., by efficient pumping [79,81]. A subset of
biomass-derived platform molecules are sufficiently thermally stable
to allow gas-phase reactions that can be investigated with estab-
lished spectroscopic tools [3,12,82]. These techniques are organized
based on the pressure regime of operation, providing increasing reso-
lution for adsorbates over gas-phase species: diffuse reflectance
infrared Fourier-Transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) at (cid:1) atmospheric
pressure; transmission FTIR under vacuum (typically >10¡6 Torr);
and HREELS under ultra-high vacuum (typically <10¡9 Torr). While
each method can provide molecular-level understanding of surface-
adsorbate interactions, sample preparation is complicated by the use
of vacuum: powder or packed-bed samples can be used in DRIFTS
instruments, while transmission cells require self-standing wafers,
and HREELS is usually conducted on single-crystal surfaces. HREELS
provides lower spectral resolution than FTIR (> 20 cm¡1 vs. 1 ¡4
cm¡1, respectively), but the ability to compare of on- and off-specu-
lar modes with HREELS can yield insights into the configuration of
surface adsorbates, which can be critical for selectively converting
multifunctional substrates [111]. The cases discussed in this section
show how vibrational spectroscopies contributed unique insights
into selectivity control in HDO and dehydration reactions of bio-
mass-derived platform molecules to valuable monomers.

P2.1.1. Hydrodeoxygenation of furanics over metal and metal carbide
catalysts

PInsights into the effects of surface binding energy and adsorption
geometry on HDO selectivity have been derived from HREELS investi-
gations of short-chain and furanic oxygenates on model catalytic sur-
faces. Because biomass-based platform molecules are multifunctional
and oxygenated, understanding competition between catalytic C(cid:1)C
and C(cid:1)O bond scissions is critical to exercising selectivity control. By
monitoring the presence and/or attenuation of specific adsorbate
vibrational modes on metals and metal carbides, e.g., Mo2C, during
temperature-programmed experiments, HREELS studies reveal the
importance of atomic oxygen binding energy (OBE) as a descriptor for
selective C(cid:1)O bond cleavage, as well as the role played by adsorption
configuration in the HDO of furanic and phenolic substrates. Further,
the molecular-level information gained from HREELS on well-defined
single crystal surfaces typically used in surface science investigations
provides an ideal starting point for computational modeling.

PHREELS observations of reactions of ethylene glycol (EG) on met-
als and metal carbides, aided by computational insights, indicate
that high OBE is correlated with preferential C(cid:1)O bond scission. Pre-
vious studies have noted that Mo-based materials selectively cleave

PC(cid:1)O bonds in EG, commonly used as a model compound for more
complex oxygenates [112,113]. HREEL spectra of adsorbed EG at
100 K on both Mo2C and 1 monolayer (ML) Ni-covered Mo2C surfaces
lack n(OH) (3085 cm¡1) and t(OH) (744 cm¡1) bands, indicating that
the presence of an ethylenedioxy species ((cid:1)O(cid:1)CH2(cid:1)CH2(cid:1)O(cid:1)) in
both cases (Scheme 2.1). On the Ni-covered surface, the n(C(cid:1)C)
mode (879 cm¡1) disappears at T > 300 K, with the concurrent for-
mation of syngas, consistent with the C(cid:1)C cleavage and reforming
activity commonly observed over metal catalysts. By contrast, on
Mo2C the n(C(cid:1)C) band remains visible at T = 500 K and only ethylene
and H2O, formed via selective C(cid:1)O bond cleavage, are detected as
products. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of atomic
binding energies (carbon = CBE, oxygen = OBE, hydrogen = HBE) show
that Mo2C has a similar CBE (736 kJ/mol) to common reforming cata-
lysts, e.g., Pt (690 kJ/mol), but a much higher OBE (674 kJ/mol vs. less
than 400 kJ/mol), suggesting that oxophilicity is a descriptor for
deoxygenation activity.

PExtending the results from EG, HREEL spectra of furanics show
Mo2C is active for HDO of these biomass-derived platform mole-
cules. Selective deoxygenation of FAL, furfuryl alcohol (FOL), and
other derivatives has the potential to be a major component of the
biomass-to-chemicals portfolio, but selectivity control is challeng-
ing. HREEL spectra of FAL and FOL adsorption on Mo2C at T < 250 K
show significant shifts in the n(C = O) (1684 cm¡1 to 1644 cm¡1) and
n(C(cid:1)O) bands (1078 cm¡1 to 1067 cm¡1), respectively, indicative of
strong surface-oxygen interactions likely in an h2(C1, O1) adsorption
configuration (Scheme 2.2). No shift of the C = C furan ring stretching
band (n(C = C) at 1596 cm¡1) is observed, and this mode sustains to
500 K even in the presence of excess adsorbed H, suggesting that
both ring hydrogenation and C(cid:1)C scission are suppressed, as

Pobserved with EG. By contrast, the C(cid:1)O bond modes of both FAL and
FOL attenuate at 250(cid:1)300 K, producing an adsorbate similar to 2-
methylfuran (2-MF) through selective C(cid:1)O scission [114,115]. DFT
calculations of the potential energy surface suggest that C(cid:1)O bond
cleavage has a lower activation barrier and more negative ΔGrxn than
C(cid:1)C scission over Mo2C, corroborating the HREELS observations
[110]. Similar to results observed with EG, Mo2C is proposed to be
selective for C(cid:1)O bond scission in furanics as a result of high OBE.

PComparison of on- and off-specular HREEL spectra of adsorbed
species suggests that the adsorption configuration of oxygenated
substrates plays significant a role in HDO selectivity control. The sur-
face selection rules of HREELS dictate that only vibrational modes
with dipole moment changes normal to the surface are visible with
the on-specular mode, while no such restriction exists for the off-
specular mode. Thus, comparison of on- and off-specular scans can
provide information about substrate adsorption configuration
[111,116(cid:1)118]. HREEL spectra reveal that FAL adsorbs in a flat orien-
tation on surfaces which are selective for decarbonylation to furan, e.
g., Ni(111) and Pt(111); the same is true of oxygenated aromatics
such as benzaldehyde. The addition of an oxophilic metal, i.e., Fe, to
a Ni(111) surface causes FAL to adsorb in a tilted configuration with
the furan ring no longer bound to the surface, rendering ring chemis-
try, i.e., decarbonylation or ring hydrogenation, less likely. DFT calcu-
lations suggest that the aldehyde C(cid:1)O bond lengthens (weakens)
after Fe is alloyed with Ni, and HDO selectivity is significantly
improved [116,119,120]. Observations of benzaldehyde and anisole
on Zn-Pt alloys (Zn being the oxophilic metal) via HREELS show simi-
lar results: the oxygenates adsorb in tilted configurations with sur-
face binding through the oxygen moieties, and selectivity to
aromatics via HDO is improved [121]. Even molecules as small as
acetaldehyde show increased selectivity for C(cid:1)O over C(cid:1)C scission
on Zn-Pt materials, suggesting this effect is general to oxygenates.
Adsorbates on crowded surfaces also favor a tilted configuration.
After pretreatment with excess H2 (100 ML) to reach a saturation
coverage of H on a Pt surface, furan production from FAL is
completely suppressed while hydrogenation to FOL proceeds. High
surface coverage is proposed to hinder flat orientation and subse-
quent decarbonylation. Meanwhile, hydrogenation and HDO are less
affected because adsorption through the carbonyl group requires a
smaller surface footprint [114,122(cid:1)124]. Understanding of how

Psurface oxophilicity and coverage affect adsorption configurations
and rates for HDO pathways of oxygenated substrates, obtained
based on HREELS studies, opens the door for selectivity control via
tuning the surface composition and coverage.

PAs a bulk catalyst, Mo2C has been successfully applied to deoxy-
genations of various biomass-derived species, e.g., long-chain bio-
oils [125(cid:1)127], phenolics [128(cid:1)133], and propanal [134], achieving
high selectivities (>90%) and confirming the general applicability of
the insights gained based on HREELS studies. Interestingly, Mo2C is
much less selective (60(cid:1)80%) for the HDO of furfural (FAL), and cata-
lyst deactivation is substantial [135(cid:1)137]. This has been attributed
to interactions with oxygenates leading to the in situ generation of
Brønsted acidic molybdenum oxycarbide sites that decompose FAL
to humins and/or coke. Bio-oils and phenolics are less sensitive to
Brønsted acid sites and thus selectivity is not as significantly affected
[138(cid:1)140]. This example highlights both the strengths and weak-
nesses of in situ/operando spectroscopy. Significant activity testing
was required to confirm the generation of Brønsted acidic sites on
the metal carbide, which could have been observed directly with
spectroscopic investigations under reaction conditions. However,
activity testing is required to confirm that the insights obtained
from spectroscopy are applicable under typical reaction conditions
and to identify any emergent behavior.

P2.1.2. Support effects in hydrodeoxygenation of furanics and phenolics

PDRIFTS experiments probing phenol conversion over supported
Pd catalysts reveal the oxophilic character of the metal oxide sup-
port to be a descriptor for selectivity to HDO reactions. Selective
HDO of phenolics (e.g., phenol, cresols, syringols and anisole), the
building blocks of lignin, to aromatics would provide a straightfor-
ward route from waste biomass feedstocks to bulk chemicals
[39,58]. Pd on common supports such as SiO2 and Al2O3 shows mar-
ginal HDO selectivity (<30%), however, when supported on more
oxophilic materials, Pd-based catalysts, e.g., Pd/TiO2, Pd/ZrO2, and
Pd/Nb2O5, are >75% selective for HDO of phenol and m-cresol to
benzene and toluene, respectively. Aromatic Csp2 (cid:1)O bonds are
highly stable and thus resistant to direct deoxygenation, but a
hypothesized surface-mediated keto-enol
tautomerization to a
cyclohexanone-like intermediate could lead to weaker Csp3 (cid:1)O bonds
after ketone hydrogenation, facilitating HDO (Scheme 2.3a) [143].

Peither neat lactic acid or the fresh catalyst. Further investigations
into the origin of this mode uncovered a general ion exchange pro-
cess between organic acids and Na+-form zeolites, generating non-
identified via a characteristic
volatile sodium-carboxylate salts,
[O(cid:1)C(cid:1)O](cid:1) stretching mode (n([O(cid:1)C(cid:1)O](cid:1)) »1605(cid:1)1570 cm¡1), and
Brønsted acid sites (BAS, n(Al-O+H(cid:1)) »3645(cid:1)3635 cm¡1, Scheme
2.4). This is interesting because a new type of acid site, i.e., BAS, is
generated on the purely Lewis acidic NaY. This discovery again high-
lights the advantage and importance of in situ/operando spectroscop-
ies, as the in situ generated BAS would not be present in ex situ
characterizations. This ion-exchange process is controlled by the
gas-phase deprotonation enthalpy of
the substrate, and ion
exchange only proceeds when the adsorbate has an acidic character
that is similar to or stronger than that of m-cresol. Further FTIR
experiments show that alkyl esters also undergo ion exchange,
forming the adsorbed sodium-carboxylate salt and a surface alkoxy
group, and the latter is readily hydrolyzed by H2O to the correspond-
ing alcohol and a BAS. These in situ generated BAS are further shown
to catalyze both methyl lactate decarbonylation to acetaldehyde and
decomposition to coke, the major side products that lower the dehy-
dration selectivity [149]. Consistent with previous reports, solid
acids that are incapable of ion exchange, e.g., HY, Sn-Beta, and
g-Al2O3, showed no dehydration activity, indicating that the lactate
salt formed via ion exchange is a necessary intermediate in the
dehydration mechanism.

PBased on the spectroscopic identification of in situ generated BAS,
including an alkaline species (pyridine) in the methyl lactate reac-
tant feed to quench these sites increased dehydration selectivity by
more than 20%. When the methyl lactate/H2O/pyridine reactant
solution was adsorbed to NaY, the resulting FTIR spectra show
evidence of pyridinium formation (n(CC[N]) = 1540 cm¡1), suggest-
ing that the alkaline additive titrates the in situ generated BAS.
Further,
a vibrational band attributed to sodium acrylate
(n(O(cid:1)C(cid:1)O) = 1575 cm¡1) grows in the absence of BAS, confirming
that sodium lactate is the key surface intermediate prior to the

PThe stability of the keto-intermediate would thus be critical to selec-
tive oxygen removal. To investigate, phenol was adsorbed to a vari-
ety of Pd/MxOy surfaces (M = Si, Al, Zr, Ti, Ce, Nb) while monitored by
DRIFTS. The n(C = O) mode of cyclohexadienone, the keto-tautomer
intermediate, appears in all cases, with a significant redshift from
the standard position at »1715 cm¡1 to 1687(cid:1)1666 cm¡1, attributed
in part to conjugation with C = Cring modes of the aromatic (Scheme
2.3a). However, the redshift is larger on more HDO-selective materi-
als (Pd/SiO2 = 1687 cm¡1, Pd/TiO2 = 1666 cm¡1), suggesting that the
support plays an active role in changing the C(cid:1)O bond energy [141].
To probe the oxophilicity, the ketone n(C = O) mode of adsorbed
cyclohexanone (molecular band at »1710 cm¡1) was analyzed, as
interactions with Lewis acidic or oxophilic surfaces cause this mode
to broaden significantly. The resulting vibrational bands were decon-
voluted into high (>1695 cm¡1), medium (1695(cid:1)1660 cm¡1), and
low (<1660 cm¡1) wavenumber regions (Scheme 2.3b). A strong
correlation was found between larger n(C = O) red-shift and deox-
ygenation activity (Fig. 2.1). The oxophilicity of the support is pro-
posed
the
cyclohexadienone HDO intermediate. Hydrogenation is readily facil-
itated by Pd nanoparticles, likely followed by dehydration to the aro-
matic product (Scheme 2.3a) [141,142,144]. Using phenol as a probe
molecule for lignin, the application of the DRIFTS technique led to
direct evidence for a hypothesized surface-adsorbed intermediate
(tautomerized cyclohexadienone) and identification of support oxo-
philicity as a predictive descriptor of HDO selectivity to aromatics
over Pd/MxOy catalysts.

P2.1.3. Methyl lactate dehydration to acrylates over NaY

PProbing gas-phase lactate adsorption on zeolite NaY with trans-
mission FTIR provided insights into a unique dehydration pathway
that relies on an ion exchange process at the solid-gas interface. Sus-
tainable production of acrylates via dehydration of cellulose-derived
lactates would provide an atom-efficient and renewable route to
mass-produced monomers, but selectivity over the most active
catalysts, alkali-metal zeolites, remains unsatisfactory [145(cid:1)147].
Knowledge of the modes of interaction between lactic acid (and its
esters) and the catalyst that lead to both the desired dehydration
and undesired decarbonylation pathways is needed for catalyst
design. When lactic acid is adsorbed on NaY, a strong vibrational
mode appears at 1604 cm¡1 that is not present in the spectrum of

Pdehydration step. This observation also indicates that the dehydra-
tion step is catalyzed by the Lewis acid sites, which are not titrated
by pyridine (Scheme 2.4) [151]. These results suggest NaY is behav-
ing as a Lewis acid-base bifunctional catalyst: the framework basic
functionality accepts a proton during the ion exchange process and
the Lewis acid functionality promotes dehydration. Kinetic experi-
ments also confirm that the presence of pyridine suppresses the
decarbonylation reaction, with the acetaldehyde production rate
reduced by an order of magnitude. The application of transmission
FTIR led directly to identification of several key reaction intermedi-
ates, e.g., adsorbed sodium lactate, as well as both selective (Lewis)
and unselective (Brønsted) acid sites on NaY, as well as a full mecha-
nistic framework for lactate dehydration on a bifunctional catalyst.

2.2. Spectroscopic investigations of reactions at solid-liquid interfaces

PThe non-volatile and oxygen-rich nature of biomass-derived mol-
ecules entails that a significant fraction of valorization reactions
must be conducted in the liquid phase, likely in the presence of sol-
vents. Spectroscopic investigations of liquid-phase reactions are rel-
atively rare, which is due at least in part to difficulties in mitigating
the strong absorption modes of bulk substrates or the solvent, which
can mask interfacial spectral features. Attenuated total reflectance
(ATR)-FTIR spectroscopy has been applied to gain insight into solid-
liquid interfacial behavior or liquid-phase catalytic activity with
some success. However, complex interactions among species in such
systems, e.g., substrate-solvent, catalyst-solvent, solvent-solvent,
makes elucidating structure-activity relations for liquid phase
reactions challenging. New techniques for both catalyst charac-
terization and the observation of working catalysts are required
to reliably investigate solid-liquid interfacial behavior, including
extension of surface-enhanced spectroscopies or increased use of
other probes, e.g., X-ray and nuclear magnetic resonance-based
techniques [85].

PATR-FTIR investigations of glycerol conversion over metal oxide-
based catalysts have noted key reaction intermediates at the solid-
liquid interface, but this technique is inherently limited to observa-
tions of strongly adsorbed species. Glycerol is a platform molecule
which can be converted to multiple value-added products, including
1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) and acrolein. Pt and oxidized W nanopar-
ticles on Al2O3 (Pt-WOx/Al2O3) and supported Nb2O5 are selective
for the hydrogenolysis (»65%) and double-dehydration (»70%) reac-
tions, respectively, in H2O solvent, and ATR-FTIR was used to probe
the appropriate surface functionalities [152(cid:1)156]. When aqueous
glycerol was introduced to both catalysts, the primary alcohol mode
(n(C(cid:1)O) = 1114 cm¡1) decreased significantly more than the second-
ary alcohol mode (n(C(cid:1)O) = 1041 cm¡1) [153,156]. Consistent with
previous reports, a new mode attributed to a terminal alkoxy species
on the oxide moiety (n(C(cid:1)O) = 1089(cid:1)1093 cm¡1) appeared in both
cases [157]. This condensation reaction leading to alkoxy formation

Pis proposed to anchor the reactant to the surface, allowing subse-
quent reactions to take place [153]. Gaining further mechanistic
insight is hindered, however, by the limitations of the ATR-FTIR
technique: because only strongly adsorbed species can be detected
due to interference from solvent and bulk modes, elucidation of the
catalyst behavior in these studies relies on other methods [158].
Briefly, hydrogenolysis is proposed to proceed through a dehydra-
tion-hydrogenation route on Pt-WOx/Al2O3, while Nb2O5 catalyzes
double dehydration due to strong Brønsted acidity and the lack of a
metallic functionality (Scheme 2.5, see Sections 3 and 4 for more
detail) [155].

PInterpretation of results from well-established characterization
techniques, e.g., pyridine adsorption/FTIR, can also be complicated
by the presence of solvents. ATR-IR studies of pyridine adsorption in
H2O on purely Lewis acidic NaY in H2O presented a strong
1540 cm¡1 pyridinium mode, suggesting the formation of BAS. How-
ever, NaY has no activity for the BAS-catalyzed ring-opening of 2,5-
dimethylfuran (DMF) to hexanedione, while HY shows significant
activity under otherwise identical conditions [159]. This example
demonstrates that direct adoption of characterization methods prac-
ticed in the gas phase or under vacuum to liquid phase without care-
ful examination could produce misleading results [86,160]. More
thorough understanding of the interaction among the probe mole-
cule, the catalyst and the solvent, as well as rigorous control experi-
ments, are needed before employing characterization techniques
developed for gas phase/vacuum phase applications in probing
liquid-solid interfaces [84(cid:1)86,160].

PDirect probing of the liquid phase species with ATR-FTIR can be
useful for kinetic modeling. In liquid-phase phenol conversion over
Pd/C + H-ZSM-5, ATR-FTIR bands for bulk phenol, cyclohexanone,
and cyclohexanol quantitatively match a kinetic model derived from
batch reactor studies. The spectroscopic technique provided high
temporal resolution and alleviated the need for laborious aliquot
sampling, which can be useful for the rapid collection of catalyst
activity data [161]. ATR-FTIR can also track distinct absorption bands
for species which are difficult to detect with common chro-
matographic methods, e.g., cellulose and humins. It has been applied
to probe the reaction pathways for aqueous cellulose hydrolysis
over sulfated-ZrO2 and humin formation from furanics over various
Brønsted acidic surfaces. Both studies mapped out reaction net-
works, and the latter determined rates and activation barriers
[162,163].

PTechniques with enhanced ability to capture solid-liquid interfa-
cial phenomena are emerging, but applications to biomass upgrad-
ing are relatively scarce at present. Surface-enhanced IR and Raman
spectroscopies (SEIRAS and SERS, respectively) have remarkable
interfacial sensitivities, but generally require conducting metallic
surfaces and are thus not currently suited for the supported catalysts
typically used in biomass valorization processes [84,85,97,164(cid:1)167].

PSERS-active core and an ultra-thin shell can potentially be employed
to study non-SERS-active materials, but achieving sufficient
spatial resolution and enhancement ability remains challenging
[99,168(cid:1)171]. Operando X-ray absorption (XAS) techniques can
track changes in catalyst structure during vapor- or liquid-phase
reactions and provide direct evidence of structure-activity relation-
ships, with no inherent technical barriers to heterogeneous catalysis
applications. XAS has been applied to track the oxidation state of
supported metallic catalysts in a few biomass-related reactions with
promising results, but practical concerns including the design and
construction of spectroscopic cells and insufficient temporal resolu-
tion still exist. By nature, XAS probes the bulk catalyst, and careful
experimental design and data analysis are required to reveal interfa-
cial information [85,90,102,172(cid:1)174]. Solid-state NMR has emerged
as a potentially powerful tool for studying condensed-phase cata-
lytic phenomena. Operando solid-state NMR has been applied to
aqueous-phase glucose conversion over NaY, and provided real-time
molecular-level
the composition of surface
adsorbates at a broad range of liquid-phase reaction conditions
[106,108,109]. Magic-angle spinning NMR was recently used to
characterize the acidity of solid catalysts in aqueous and mixed-sol-
vent (DMSO(cid:1)(cid:1)H2O) environments, which have been difficult to reli-
ably probe with other experimental techniques [108].

PSpectroscopic techniques, especially vibrational spectroscopies,
are an indispensable part of the technique portfolio for researchers
seeking to understand molecular-level mechanistic pathways in bio-
mass-to-chemicals conversions. HREELS and FTIR studies have pro-
vided key insights into reaction mechanisms, selectivity control and
catalyst design in several key biomass transformations. The rigorous
application of these techniques to a broader range of reactions
would bring more clarity to understanding of active pathways.
Despite recent progress in Raman spectroscopy, X-ray absorption,
solid-state NMR, and ATR-FTIR spectroscopies, the in situ detection
of solid-liquid interfacial phenomena remains in early stages.

3. Computational techniques

PStudies that incorporate computational modeling of surface phe-
nomena have increasingly become an indispensable part of hetero-
geneous catalytic research in general and investigations of biomass-
to-chemicals valorization in particular [175(cid:1)178]. Experimental
techniques can provide snapshots of ensemble behavior and proper-
ties of a catalytic system in a top-down manner, but this is typically
insufficient to construct a complete molecular-level mechanistic pic-
ture. Thus, proposed mechanisms based on evidence from experi-
mental studies are often open to multiple interpretations, especially
given the complexities in substrates, catalysts and reaction media
in biomass-related reaction systems. By contrast, first principles
computational modeling uses a bottom-up approach, employing
atomically and electronically well-defined models [179(cid:1)181]. This
methodology allows insights into reaction states that are inaccessi-
ble to experimental methods, e.g., the electronic structure of short-
lived reaction intermediates and activated complexes. Computa-
tional methods that efficiently map key chemical properties, e.g.,
binding energies of carbon and oxygen, of a variety of catalytic mate-
rials are powerful tools for identifying predictive trends. Meanwhile,
for computational studies to provide the most useful insight into
reaction mechanisms, model surfaces with realistic compositions
and structures, based on experimental characterizations, must be
adopted. At present, DFT-based ab initio calculations are computa-
tionally expensive and often restricted by computational resources
to relatively idealized model systems [176(cid:1)178,182(cid:1)186]. Never-
theless, systematic computational results from simplified, but prac-
tical and well-constructed, models can still provide valuable insights
when used to interpret experimental kinetic data or develop general
parameters for catalyst design [187,188]. Computational modeling

Phas led to critical insights into descriptors of selectivity for key bio-
mass-to-chemicals reactions, including ring-opening of furanics and
deoxygenation of furfural and anisole [179(cid:1)181]. In addition to
these case studies, we also briefly review recent advances in multi-
scale modeling (MSM) techniques, which aim to bridge the gap
between these simplified models and the complex behavior of real
catalysts by applying first-principles semi-empirical correlations
that reduce computational cost without significantly sacrificing
accuracy. This is a powerful approach for taking reliable descriptors
derived from a model system and efficiently screening a broad spec-
trum of potential catalytic materials to identify promising candi-
dates for more in-depth investigations [189(cid:1)194]. Recent progress
have promised MSM a more prominant role in future biomass
upgrading research.

3.1. Mechanistic insights from computational simulations of model
surfaces

PSignificant insights into structure-activity relations for metal-
based biomass upgrading catalysts have been achieved via computa-
tional modeling of adsorbates on well-defined metal surfaces.
Although computational techniques and computing hardware have
advanced significantly in recent years, applied studies are still lim-
ited to simple model systems such as thin slabs of flat or stepped
metals under vacuum for detailed investigations of thermodynamic
properties and surface-adsorbate interactions [175,176]. While the-
oretical models do not capture all the structural and functional
nuances of real-world catalysts, e.g., supported nanoparticles, domi-
nant functionalities and behavior are represented, and kinetic
experiments can be used to validate, extend or refute the conclu-
sions. Through interplays between computational modeling and
experimental measurements, descriptors of catalytic activity can be
identified and generalized to the relevant parameter space [177]. In
the cases presented below, computational modeling was used to
identify either kinetic, i.e., transition state-based, or thermodynamic,
i.e., surface functionality-based, descriptors of catalyst activity,
which helped explain experimental results or develop parameters
for the rational design of new catalysts.

P3.1.1. Hydrogenolysis of cyclic ethers over metal-metal oxide composite
catalysts

PComputational insights into surface functionality and reaction
pathways show that the rate of C(cid:1)O bond hydrogenolysis over sup-
ported Me1-Me2Ox materials can be described by the stability of the
cation intermediate generated in a protonation-hydrogenation
mechanism. The renewable production of a,v-diols, particularly 1,5-
pentanediol, from renewable sources is highly desirable as these
chemicals are widely used as monomers in polymer synthesis
[196,197]. A class of materials comprised of bimetallic nanoparticles
with one noble metal (Me1 = Rh, Pt, or Ir) and one partially oxidized
oxophilic metal (Me2 = Mo or Re) supported on SiO2 or carbon were
shown to be highly selective (> 95%) for terminal diol synthesis via
ring-opening of multifunctional cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofur-
furyl alcohol (THFA) [195,198(cid:1)202]. In the absence of spectroscopic
investigations due to the limitations of probing liquid-phase chemis-
try as discussed in Section 2, theoretical modeling of Me1-Me2Ox
clusters provided key insights into proposed surface functionality
and reaction intermediates. Based on these results, a sequential pro-
tonation-hydrogenation mechanism was proposed wherein hydride
transfer is the rate-determining step (Scheme 3.1) [195,203,204]. An
alternative mechanism based on regioselective hydride attack from
the Me1-Me2Ox surface has also been proposed based on kinetic
analysis [205(cid:1)207]. There is ongoing discussion regarding these two
mechanisms, and the experimental evidence-based case for each is
presented in Section 4.2.1.

Scheme 3.1. Proposed mechanism for the ring opening of THFA over Me1-Me2Ox/SiO2 catalysts, including concerted protonation-hydride transfer to generate the stable oxocar-
benium ion followed by hydrogenation. Adapted from Ref. [195].

PModeling of simplified surfaces elucidated the bifunctionality
of Me1-Me2Ox catalysts and the role of each component during
ring-opening of saturated furanics. DFT calculations estimate that
the deprotonation enthalpy (DPE) of hydroxyl groups on
Rh[200]Re1OH clusters is 1140 kJ/mol, lower than most zeolites (DPE
»1150(cid:1)1200 kJ/mol) and comparable to highly acidic heteropolya-
cids [208(cid:1)212]. Study of many Me1-Me2OH structure models found
that the OBE (i.e., oxophilicity) of non-noble Me2 is the strongest
descriptor for DPE of the hydroxyl group: stronger Me2-O bonds lead
to weaker O(cid:1)(cid:1)H bonds and stronger Brønsted acidity. The identity of
the noble Me1 and the Me1-Me2 binding configuration play a minor
role in surface acidity also play minor roles [203,204]. The model
clusters predict that hydrogenation sites are provided by the noble
metal moiety, thus creating a bifunctional catalyst with atomically
mixed Brønsted acid and hydrogenation sites. Ab initio molecular
dynamics simulations show the surface sites can protonate O atoms
in adsorbates such as THFA, the first step in the protonation-hydro-
genation pathway (Scheme 3.1). The experimental rate of ring-open-
ing to 1,5-pentanediol
is correlated with average surface DPE,
suggesting the initiating protonation step is kinetically relevant. For
example, 1,5-pentanediol formation is roughly twice as fast over Rh-
ReOx (DPE »1140 kJ/mol) as over Rh-MoOx (DPE »1155 kJ/mol)
[204]. Supported Me2Ox materials are generally inactive for ring-
opening, leading to the conclusion that the noble metal plays a dual
role: (1) interactions with Me2 increase the acidity of surface
hydroxyl groups; and (2) providing a hydrogenation function to
push the reaction to the final products [195,203,204].

PAb initio molecular dynamics simulations of general C(cid:1)O hydro-
genolysis reactions reveal that observed reaction rates can be corre-
lated to the stability of cationic intermediates generated via
protonation. Over Rh-ReOx/C, specific rates for ring-opening hydro-
genolysis of C(cid:1)O bonds in species with a-hydroxyl groups, e.g.,
THFA or 2-hydroxymethyl-tetrahydropyran, are much higher than
substrates without side hydroxyl groups, e.g., tetrahydrofuran and
tetrahydropyran are inactive, or when the hydroxyl is not a to the
target C(cid:1)O bond, e.g., 4-hydroxytetrahydropyran (Fig. 3.1). The

tion (N.R., right) for C(cid:1)O hydrogenolysis over supported Me1(cid:1)Me2Ox catalysts. The
cleaved C(cid:1)O bonds are highlighted in blue. Adapted from Refs. [195,206].

Pthermodynamic stability of the cationic intermediate is proposed to
describe this trend: oxocarbenium ions (R = O+H) are much more sta-
ble than typical carbenium ions, and thus species which can form
these structures through concerted protonation and hydride transfer
react much more rapidly (Scheme 3.1). The oxocarbenium ion inter-
mediates are also shown to reduce the activation barrier by
16(cid:1)84 kJ/mol, consistent with the experimentally observed reaction
rates. With these insights, a general framework for predicting the
rate of C(cid:1)O hydrogenolysis reactions based on intermediate cation
formation energy was proposed and experimentally validated using
a variety of alcohol and ether substrates [195]. In this case study,
computational results provided vital information about surface func-
tionality and reaction pathways, but confirmation and feedback from
kinetic rate measurements also played a significant role in refining
and generalizing the model, illustrating the importance of close
interplay of computational and experimental techniques.

P3.1.2. Hydrogenation and deoxygenation of furanics over metal
surfaces

PComputational studies of FAL adsorption behavior on metal slab
models indicate that manipulating the surface electronic structure
can alter preferred adsorption configuration and subsequent reaction
pathways, and descriptors derived from these models are predictive
of selectivity on metal surfaces. FAL is generally used as a model spe-
cies for complex, substituted furanics in these studies to observe
trends in selectivity to decarbonylation, hydrogenation, and HDO
[5,6,11,32,49,56]. Properties of single crystal metal surfaces, particu-
larly atomic binding energies and adsorbate coverage, are predictive
of experimentally measured selectivities on metal catalysts with
more complex structures, illustrating that idealized models used in
computational studies can provide catalytically relevant insights.

PA computational study supported by rate measurements employ-
ing 1-butanal as a probe molecule for aldehydes suggests the ratio
between CBE and OBE is more descriptive of deoxygenation activity
than OBE alone [213]. Decarbonylation of 1-butanal to propane is the
dominant pathway on Pt, while Cu is more selective for hydrogenol-
ysis to butane, and Ir produces a mixture of the two alkanes. DFT cal-
culations show that the CBE is much higher than the OBE for Pt(111),
and that the aldehyde group is bound to the metal in an h1-acyl con-
figuration with the O atom off the surface, which is a precursor to
decarbonylation (Table 3.1, Scheme 3.2). By contrast, Ir(111) is calcu-
lated to have a similar CBE to Pt(111), but OBE almost 200 kJ/mol
higher, making it comparable to CBE. On Cu(111), OBE is slightly
greater than CBE. When the atomic binding energies are in a ratio »1,
binding through both the carbon and oxygen atoms in an h2-alde-
hyde configuration and subsequent hydrogenolysis chemistry
involving that bond are more likely (Scheme 3.2) [116,217]. Thus,
hydrogenolysis activity can be correlated with OBE/CBE (in parenthe-
sis): Pt (0.7) < Ir (0.97) < Cu (1.01) [213].

Scheme 3.2. Adsorption orientation for generic aldehyde species on a surface with
carbon binding energy much greater than oxygen binding energy (left), roughly equal
carbon and oxygen binding energies (middle), and the upright adsorption configura-
tion of furfural on Cu surfaces as a result of repulsive electronic interactions (right)
[213,215(cid:1)218].

PAlthough Cu surfaces are selective for hydrogenolysis of butanal,
unique surface electronic interactions with adsorbed FAL lead to
high C = O hydrogenation selectivity (up to 98%) with minimal C(cid:1)O
bond cleavage. Repulsion caused by an overlap between the surface
3d band of Cu(111) and the furan ring p-electrons ring leads to an
unexpected upright adsorption configuration of FAL through the
aldehyde O in an h1(O) configuration (Scheme 3.2) [215,216]. This
computational prediction is confirmed by a shift in the C = O stretch-
ing mode from 1720 cm¡1 to 1670 cm¡1 in FTIR spectroscopy. The
aldehyde carbon atom is tilted away from the surface, making chem-
istry involving this atom, i.e., decarbonylation or hydrogenolysis,
unlikely. High hydrogenation selectivity is observed on pure Cu and
in alloys with Pd: as Cu wt% is increased in PdCu alloys, FOL selectiv-
ity increases from »20% (pure Pd) to »80% (Cu: Pd 4:1 by mass).
Similar to butanal, however, the dominant FAL conversion pathway
over Cu is dictated by the adsorption configuration: because only
the aldehyde O atom interacts with the surface, selectivity to the
hydrogenation product (FOL) is high [215,216].

PComplete reaction network modeling of FAL conversion over
noble metal surfaces reveal that the preferred adsorption configura-
tion is again predictive of selectivity, and the thermodynamics of
surface species can be manipulated via surface coverage. At low cov-
erages on noble metals, e.g., Pt(111) and Pd(111), FAL adsorbs pref-
erentially in a flat orientation with the furan ring parallel to the
surface. Computational investigations of the FAL reaction network
show that at low coverages on Pd(111) that adsorbed furan is the
most stable furanic surface species. As a result, furan resides in a
potential energy well, and activation barriers for “reverse” reactions
back to FAL, FOL, or 2-MF are prohibitively high (176 kJ/mol,
Scheme 3.3, in red). Further, the C = O hydrogenation/C(cid:1)O dehydro-
genation barriers (77 kJ/mol and 49 kJ/mol, respectively) are esti-
than direct decarbonylation (92 kJ/mol),
mated to be lower
suggesting aldehyde/alcohol equilibrium on the surface, with a pos-
sible contribution to furan yield from loss of the FOL hydroxymethyl
group (106 kJ/mol) [219]. However, reactions are not generally car-
ried out on “clean” catalytic surfaces, and increasing adsorption cov-
erage of FAL or H2 in the model significantly changed the potential
energy surface. As total surface coverage (FAL, H, or a mixture of

Pboth) rises above »0.5, a tilted adsorption orientation of FAL, in
which two ring carbon atoms and the aldehyde group interact with
the metal atoms, becomes more thermodynamically stable. In a
microkinetic model that considers surface coverage, hydrogenation
selectivity rises rapidly with PH2, eventually reaching nearly 100%
[220]. These model predictions are generally validated by experi-
mental data: at low PH2, decarbonylation selectivities approach 80%
over both Pt and Pd catalysts [221,222]. At higher H2 pressures (up
to 33 bar), hydrogenation, HDO, and even sequential hydrogenation/
hydrogenolysis reactions of 2-MF dominate over the same materials
(up to 80% total selectivity) [123,223,224]. Similar results have been
obtained in the aqueous phase for HDO of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural
(HMF) to DMF, a potential fuel additive, achieving 87% selectivity at
100 bar H2 over a Ni/C catalyst [225]. When FAL can adsorb in a flat
orientation at low total surface coverage, furan is the favored prod-
uct. At higher coverages when the most stable configuration is tilted,
selectivity shifts to hydrogenation or HDO as a result of decreased
interactions between the surface and the aldehyde carbon.

PThe predictive nature of adsorption configuration on metal surfa-
ces does have exceptions. In anisole deoxygenation over Pt and Fe
surfaces, single-slab models found that anisole adsorbs in a similar
configuration (through the aromatic ring) on Pt(111) and Fe(110)
surfaces. The modeled adsorption energies for anisole, phenol and
benzene on the single-crystal surfaces are also similar (within 15 kJ/
mol) despite the oxophilicity of Fe(110) (Table 3.1). Hydrogenolysis
selectivity to benzene was observed to be much higher over Fe/SiO2
(85%) than over Pt/SiO2 (7%), which was selective for phenol. This
discrepancy suggests that oxophilicity is a more powerful general
descriptor for deoxygenation than adsorption configuration, which
may be limited to molecules with steric configurations similar to
FAL [214]. This example illustrates the risk in translating results
obtained from investigations of model species to different classes of
substrates.

PBuilding on previous computational insights, selective HDO of
FAL/FOL to 2-MF has been achieved over bimetallics with tailored
properties to direct substrate adsorption orientation. Models of NiFe
and PdFe alloys suggest that the properties of the two metals are
essentially combined, i.e., the addition of oxophilic Fe serves to
increase the stability of the h2-aldehyde binding configuration by
drawing O towards the surface [218]. Although pure Ni and Pd are
generally unselective to HDO (< 5% at low PH2), NiFe and PdFe alloys
are up to 65% and 85% selective to 2-MF, respectively, attributed to
the balanced CBE and OBE functionalities of the surfaces (Table 3.1)
[222,224]. Alloys of Pd and oxophilic base metals have thus been
proposed as a general strategy for HDO reactions, particularly for
HMF to DMF [223]. Recently, more complex materials such as Pd-

PCoOx core-shell nanoparticles and partially oxidized Ru-RuOx/C have
also shown high selectivities for HDO: > 95% selectivity to DMF from
HMF and 80% 2-MF selectivity from FAL, respectively [123,226].
Molecular dynamics simulations of HMF/FAL conversion over these
materials suggest that selectivity is achieved through a radical-
mediated mechanism that involves the generation of surface vacan-
cies on the oxide moieties. Further study of this pathway is war-
ranted, as it may provide general insights into the low-temperature
activation of C(cid:1)O bonds on catalysts with metal oxide components
[123,227]. In summary, computational modeling of FAL conversion
over model metal surfaces led to the conclusion that adsorption
geometry is predictive of reaction pathways, and that the thermody-
namically stable adsorption orientations can be manipulated by
alloying metals with appropriate properties and controlling surface
adsorbate coverage.

3.2. Multi-scale modeling for catalyst design

PRecent advances in semi-empirical modeling and software algo-
rithms have provided a framework for multi-scale modeling (MSM)
to play a larger role in the development of next-generation biomass
upgrading catalysts [194]. MSM seeks to accelerate screening and
design of catalysts by modeling the catalytic performance at realistic
conditions with results attained from molecular-level investigations,
i.e., quantum mechanical (QM) calculations, of model systems
[190,191]. As discussed above, micro-scale models can provide
insights into catalytic reaction mechanisms and activity descriptors,
but experimental screening of materials remains the default method
for catalyst discovery. The first-principles modeling of “real” cata-
lytic systems including complex materials, reactants, or reaction
media, remains out of reach with current software and computing
hardware. MSM seeks to deploy high-level QM calculations spar-
ingly, by employing first-principles semi-empirical models (FPSEM)
to rapidly obtain estimates of necessary thermodynamic and kinetic
data at substantially reduced computational cost [175,176,178,189].
When provided with a descriptor of catalytic activity or parameteri-
zation in the form of kinetic measurements, this approach drastically
reduces the computational resources needed to investigate catalytic
reactions at relevant temperatures and pressures across a vast
parameter space [188,228]. FPSEMs including linear scaling relation-
ships (LSRs) and group additivity (GA) for estimating adsorption
energies and Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) relations for correlating
the energetics and activation barriers of reactions, have recently
been extended to cover materials and substrates relevant to biomass
conversion [229(cid:1)237]. Reaction network generators combine FPSEM
with machine learning and sensitivity algorithms to investigate all
possible elementary steps and reduce the system to a critical subset
of elementary reactions for more focused investigation [238(cid:1)242].
Readers interested in the development of computational heteroge-
neous catalysis are referred to recent comprehensive reviews
[178,188]. In this section we briefly discuss the advances critical to
the computational study of biomass upgrading processes.

PTailoring existing principles and discovering new correlations
have been key elements in facilitating the computational screening
and prediction of catalytic materials for biomass upgrading reac-
tions. The correlations between reaction enthalpies and activation
barriers for a group of similar reactions, i.e., the BEP relation, has
been known for decades [187,243]. Recent work has established
quantitative BEP relations for common biomass catalyst materials
such as transition metals [244], transition metal oxides [245], and
transition metal carbides [246], as well as for the cleavage of C(cid:1)C
and C(cid:1)O bonds over metals [247], which is vital to effective multi-
scale modeling of biomass deoxygenation chemistry. The BEP rela-
tionship has been extended to transition state scaling (TSS), which
relates the surface binding energies of the initial or final state of an
elementary reaction step to the energy of the transition state,

Preducing the need for high level electronic structure calculations for
the investigated of activated complexes and activation barriers
[178,186,248,249]. One of the key breakthroughs in FPSEMs was the
discovery that adsorption energies of molecular fragments, e.g., CHx
and NHx, on metal surfaces scale generally linearly with the appro-
priate atomic binding energy. The slopes of these linear scaling rela-
tions have been established for a number of types of surfaces or
metal facets, making it possible to rapidly estimate the adsorption
energy of complex molecules on an entire group of materials based
solely on adsorbate composition and structure [176,188,250(cid:1)252].
In order to apply these ideas to biomass reactions, LSRs have been
established for a variety of oxygenates, e.g., alcohols [253(cid:1)255],
glycerol [256(cid:1)259], furans [248,260], and sugar alcohols [261], on
appropriate materials such as transition metals and oxides [262,263]
Recent works have also analyzed how these relations apply to
bifunctional and/or bimetallic materials [61,188,237,264]. Scaling
relations for vibrational frequencies of simple adsorbates [265] and
a benchmark database for energy barriers of simple reactions on
transition metal surfaces based on adsorption LSR have recently
been shown [266,267]. Together, these studies represent major steps
toward accurate screening of the type of complex materials needed
to selectively convert multifunctional biomass substrates. While it is
still premature to assess the full impact of these developments in
computational methods on biomass research, recent studies have
yielded promising results. For example, TSS has been employed to
computationally predict the most active transition metal surface
for acetic acid hydrogenation [268], and BEP relations have helped
select the best transition metal promoter for direct deoxygenation of
woody biomass to fuel-grade alkanes [269].

PIn another significant step toward effective multi-scale modeling
of biomass reactions, the GA method for estimating thermodynamic
properties, first developed for hydrocarbons, was extended to oxy-
genated molecules. GA was originally developed in the 1960 s to
reduce the number of calculations needed to describe combustion
reactions by summing the contributions from molecular fragments
of hydrocarbons, and has been employed in a wide variety of surface
science applications [229(cid:1)232,270]. Recently, this model has been
extended to evaluate highly oxygenated biomass-derived molecules,
beginning with the heat of adsorption of polyols on Pt(111) and Ni-
covered Pt(111) surfaces [254]. Subsequently, GA methods for fur-
anics, phenolics, lignin-derived bio-oil monomers, and alcohols in
the aqueous phase have been developed, with terms tailored to
address the characteristics of these species, e.g., ring deformation
and multi-site surface binding [260,271(cid:1)273]. Error analysis of sev-
eral semi-empirical methods, i.e., GA, LSRs and BEP, using oxygen-
ated hydrocarbons showed that GA is slightly superior in predicting
energetics [274,275]. Meanwhile, applications of these GA relation-
ships as tools for biomass research remain a work in progress.

PCombined with improved computing hardware and algorithms,
the advent of reliable FPSEM relations has the potential to transition
multiscale modeling techniques from a resource-intensive and
after-the-fact tool into a routine and predictive approach to evaluate
entire reaction networks and potential energy surfaces to optimize
catalysts and reaction conditions [276,277]. State of the art reaction
network generators could rapidly reduce hundreds or even thou-
sands of potential pathways into the most likely microkinetic reac-
tion mechanisms with only a few initial parameters derived from
idealized models and/or experiment, e.g., atomic binding energies.
Software such as the Rule Input Network Generator (RING) and
Reaction Mechanism Generator (cid:1) Catalysis (RMG-Cat) rely on
FPSEM relations for thermodynamic property calculations and the
degree of rate control theory to identify possibly kinetically signifi-
cant steps [238,241,278,279]. This approach has been applied to
biomass-relevant reactions including: (1) acid-catalyzed fructose
conversion to HMF and its subsequent conversion to levulinic acid,
where RING accurately selected the literature mechanisms after

Pgenerating thousands of potential reactions [238]; and (2) glycerol
conversion over noble metals, in which decomposition is correctly
proposed as the most likely pathway on these surfaces [239,240].
Reaction network generators which take advantage of machine
learning techniques can investigate networks much more quickly, as
the algorithm can apply rules “learned” from a DFT-based training
set to evaluate possible reaction pathways and make more informed
decisions about the allocation of expensive QM calculations [280].
Error analysis through “sloppy modeling” and the use of functionals
with built-in error estimation can further decrease computational
time by rapidly evaluating whether FPSEM is sufficiently accurate or
more detailed DFT calculations are required [266,281]. A reaction
network analysis tool which takes advantage of FPSEM, machine
learning, and built-in error analysis was shown to accurately predict
the favorable reaction pathways for CO and H2 on Rh(111) with a
95% reduction in DFT calculations. The procedure prioritizes quick
identification of potential rate-determining steps, and resorts to
expensive, but more accurate DFT calculations only when necessary
[228,281]. All of these techniques are inherently scalable given the
simplicity of the underlying correlations, and many are open-source
and therefore available to the community for further development.

PComputational techniques are increasingly valuable tools for
investigations of catalytic processes, particularly biomass valoriza-
tion. Simplified models of metal surfaces have been used to identify
descriptors for two key upgrading reactions involving multifunc-
tional substrates, i.e.. ring-opening hydrogenolysis and HDO of fur-
anics. The accurate modeling of surface functionality and the
resulting effects on catalysis illustrate the predictive qualities of
even the idealized metal slab models typically used for ab initio stud-
ies. Further, developments in FPSEM and other algorithms, com-
bined with better computing hardware, are making MSM a
informative tool for directing experimental research and aiding in
the rational design of next generation biomass upgrading catalysts.

4. Reaction kinetics

PKinetic analysis is an informative technique for probing catalytic
reaction mechanisms in complex systems where obtaining detailed
information from other techniques is challenging, such as the liquid-
or multi-phase catalytic reactions common to biomass upgrading.
Biomass-to-chemicals conversions are often conducted in liquid or
multiphasic media with solvents due to the high boiling point and/
or low decomposition temperature of biomass-derived platform
molecules [3,11,282,283]. Moreover, high pressure is often needed
to increase the solubility of H2 [9,23,31]. While the complex media
and severe reaction conditions often present an insurmountable bar-
rier for computational studies and in situ/operando spectroscopic and
imaging techniques, kinetic investigations remain feasible. Determi-
nation of apparent activation barriers, reaction order(s), and kinetic
isotope effects can provide indirect evidence regarding surface-
mediated reaction mechanisms. While it is desirable to develop cata-
lysts that produce high yields of desired products, kinetic studies
must be conducted at differential conversion to measure intrinsic
rates in the absence of heat and mass transport limitations. For effec-
tive catalyst comparison, reaction rates are ideally evaluated on a
per site basis, i.e., via turnover frequency (TOF) [284(cid:1)289]. Kinetic
models based on intrinsic activity data shed light on the reaction
mechanism and identify kinetically relevant steps in a given reaction
network [190,192,279,290]. Critically, kinetic models developed
from reaction rate measurements should never be used as proof of a
given mechanism. Multiple mathematical models can often be fit to
the same rate data, particularly if extra parameters not derived from
an intrinsic property of the system are included. Coupling kinetic
analysis with other experimental techniques, e.g., operando spec-
troscopies, will lead to more concrete and molecular level mechanis-
tic understanding. When these techniques are unavailable, kinetic

Panalysis is useful for developing understanding of multifunctional
catalytic behavior, as the activity of intermediates or well-character-
ized test reactions can be used to systematically probe surface func-
tionality. Thorough investigations of hydrogenolysis, hydrogenation,
and Diels-Alder cycloaddition reactions via the intrinsic kinetic
parameters have provided key insights into the molecular-level
mechanisms of liquid-phase biomass upgrading reactions.

4.1. Development and parameterization of kinetic models for reaction
optimization

PKinetic modeling is a widely used tool in reaction engineering
that can be used to probe or suggest potential reaction mechanisms
and to help identify optimal reaction conditions. Typically derived
from a set of elementary reaction steps, models require parameteri-
zation using rate constants, equilibrium constants, and activation
barriers measured from catalytic testing. The parameterized model
can then be used to optimize reaction conditions, e.g., temperature,
pressure, concentration, and space velocity, to maximize yield and
suppress side reactions. In the following cases, measurements of
kinetic data provided insights into the catalytic reaction mechanisms
levulinate
of DMF ring-opening to 2-hexanone and methyl
conversion to g-valerolactone (GVL). Kinetic models based on
the mechanisms were derived, parameterized, and validated with
experimental data for the optimization of reaction conditions to
achieve high yields of value-added products.

P4.1.1. 2,5-dimethylfuran ring-opening to 2-hexanone over Pt/C

PKinetic analysis of DMF conversion over supported Pt/C in nonane
revealed a keto-enol tautomer to be the key intermediate in the
ring-opening hydrogenolysis pathway [291]. 2-hexanone, an impor-
tant industrial solvent, has been obtained in high yield (> 90%) from
DMF over a Pt/C catalyst after optimization of reaction conditions
using a parameterized kinetic model [292,293]. Over supported noble
metal catalysts, DMF can be converted through ring hydrogenation to
2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran (DMTHF) or through ring-opening to 2-
hexanone/2-hexanol (Scheme 4.1). Analysis of the initial rates and
observed H2 reaction orders suggest that these two pathways are
parallel rather than sequential [294]. Zeroth-order dependence on
DMF was observed for both products, indicative of strong substrate
adsorption. Ring hydrogenation follows a 2nd-order kinetic regime in
H2 partial pressure, showing the last of the four H additions is most
likely rate-limiting. By contrast, ring-opening displayed 0.6-order
dependence on H2, suggesting only the first H addition event, pro-
posed to occur across a C(cid:1)O bond kinetically relevant. Both 2-hexa-
none and 2-hexanol are observed as ring-opened products, and the
ratio between the two species is independent of the conversion of
DMF. This is more consistent with the presence of a common inter-
mediate than sequential hydrogenation of the ketone, which is pro-
posed to be a minor pathway only at high conversion. This common
intermediate was proposed to be a keto-enol tautomer pair, meaning
the observed ketone/alcohol product ratio is determined by the tau-
tomer equilibrium and relative rates of ketone and (cid:1)enol hydrogena-
tion (Scheme 4.1). A kinetic model was derived from the proposed
network and parameterized with measured activation energies (Ea)
as well as rate and equilibrium constants. The model indicated that
operation at relatively low PH2 and high temperature would mini-
mize ring hydrogenation and promote tautomerization, respectively.
Maximum 2-hexanone yields of 90(cid:1)95% were achieved at 120 °C

Pidentifying the active site for the critical catalytic transfer hydro-
genation (CTH) step over tetravalently-substituted zeolite materials.
GVL is a potential green solvent and platform molecule that can be
produced selectively from cellulose-derived levulinates over Lewis
acidic metal-substituted zeolite materials, which are known to be
effective catalysts for CTH chemistry [10,23,295(cid:1)300]. CTH employs
organic hydrogen donors such as butanol to efficiently hydrogenate
carbonyl groups. The hydrogenation of methyl levulinate has been
hypothesized to proceed via a Meerwein(cid:1)Pondorf(cid:1)Verley (MPV)
mechanism with a 6-member ring intermediate, supported by incor-
poration of deuterium at the appropriate location in GVL when using
[301(cid:1)304]. Kinetic
deuterated hydrogen donors (Scheme 4.2)
experiments with tetravalent metal-incorporated zeolites (Hf-Beta,

PZr-Beta, Sn-Beta, and Ti-Beta) as catalysts support a proposed
mechanism with CTH as the rate-limiting step (RLS) to generate 4-
hydroxypentanoate, which subsequently undergoes spontaneous
lactonization to GVL. The reaction is first order with respect to both
methyl levulinate and alcohol solvent, e.g., 2-butanol, suggesting
that both are involved in the RLS. A kinetic isotope effect of »2 is
observed when using isopropanol-d[8] as the solvent, indicating that
hydride transfer is rate-limiting; similar effects have been observed
in other CTH systems [226,302]. While the apparent activation bar-
riers are similar over Hf-, Zr-, and Sn-Beta (52 kJ/mol), the barrier
over Ti-Beta is significantly higher (69 kJ/mol) [305]. Previous char-
acterization of these materials suggests that most Me4+-substituted
zeolite frameworks form hydrolyzed “open” sites within the frame-
work with hydroxyl groups on both the substituted metal and a
neighboring Si, but Ti-Beta does not [306]. The higher Ea for levuli-
nate conversion over Ti-Beta therefore indicates that open sites are
likely more active for CTH than “closed” Me(cid:1)O(cid:1)Si sites. With equal
kinetic barriers, the relative catalytic activity trend (Hf > Zr > Sn) is
tentatively attributed to the difference in the pre-exponential factors
(A), and the ordering of these values was tentatively correlated to
the fraction of “open” versus “closed” sites in the frameworks under
reaction conditions. The measured A and Ea values were used to
parameterize a model for packed-bed, liquid-phase flow reactor
which was validated at a variety of reactant space velocities. A maxi-
mum GVL yield of 77% was obtained at 150 °C and 15 bar N2 with
negligible side products. The developed model accurately calculates
GVL yields at various space velocities with high accuracy, which can
provide the basis for reactor design in industrial applications [305].

4.2. Kinetic investigations for mechanistic insights

catalysts.

Investigating

PUsing experimentally determined kinetic parameters to draw
insights into catalytic reaction mechanisms is a key approach in
understanding liquid-phase biomass-to-chemicals conversions on
multifunctional
catalytic mechanisms
through the measurement of kinetic information involves piecing
together disparate data points, e.g., activation barriers, reaction
orders, and kinetic isotope effects, into a cohesive framework. These
proposed mechanisms are often tested by assessing predicted
changes when a certain parameter is modified or an intermediate is
introduced. Well-characterized test reactions are also used to reveal
the presence or absence of specific surface functionalities [307,308].
Further, the implications of a proposed mechanism are evaluated
through experiments utilizing probe molecules with selected func-
tionality, which assumes that no other reaction pathways other than
the one under study exist with the probe molecule. In this section,
we discuss investigations into the mechanisms of two liquid-phase
biomass upgrading reactions, i.e., hydrogenolysis of cyclic ethers

P4.2.1. Hydrogenolysis of cyclic ethers and glycerol over metal-metal
oxide composite catalysts

PThe selective hydrogenolysis of C(cid:1)O bonds in biomass-derived
substrates such as glycerol to synthesize a,v-diols is a critical path-
way for the renewable synthesis of commodity chemicals [3,64,309].
Glycerol is produced in large quantities as a byproduct in biodiesel
production, and its effective upgrade to a value-added polymer pre-
cursor would improve the carbon utilization and cost-effectiveness
of a major renewable process [310(cid:1)312]. Glycerol hydrogenolysis to
1,2-propanediol has been achieved in with high yields (>95%) using
inexpensive nonprecious metal catalysts, but selective conversion
to the more valuable 1,3-PDO remains challenging [64,313]. In Sec-
tion 3.1.1 we discussed computational modeling related to the activ-
ity of supported Me1-Me2Ox nanoparticles that efficiently catalyzed
ring-opening of cyclic ethers such as THFA. A dehydration-hydro-
genation mechanism was proposed based on the stability of cationic
intermediates and surface functionality based on DFT calculations
and supported with measured rates (Scheme 3.1) [195,203,204].
Results from several studies on glycerol hydrogenolysis to 1,3-PDO
appear to support this mechanistic conclusion [64,155,156,314].
However, other works utilizing similar substrates proposed a differ-
ent pathway based on regioselective hydride attack [207,315]. No
general consensus has formed around a single mechanism for this
important set of reactions, and the kinetic data supporting each pos-
sibility are discussed below.

PKinetic isotope effect (KIE) measurements, analysis of reaction
intermediates, and activity dependence on BAS density support the
conclusion that glycerol hydrogenolysis to 1,3-PDO proceeds via the
dehydration-hydrogenation mechanism. The rate-limiting step of
this pathway is proposed to be a hydride transfer which occurs in
concert with protonation [195]. A KIE of »2 is observed when using
glycerol(OH)3-d5 over Pt-ReOx/SiO2, indicating that the activation of
a C(cid:1)H bond on the substrate is involved in the rate-limiting step
[314]. A similar KIE (»1.7) is measured when using isopropanol-d[8]
as the hydrogen species in the CTH of FAL, which is also proposed to
be limited by C(cid:1)H activation [226]. Strong Brønsted acid catalysts, e.
g., heteropolyacids, can selectively double-dehydrate glycerol to
acrolein, passing through 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HP) as a
likely intermediate (Scheme 4.3) [314,316,317]. However, in the
presence of H2 this intermediate is hydrogenated to 1,3-PDO rather
than undergoing further dehydration to acrolein [316]. This suggests
that over Me1-Me2Ox nanoparticles with hydrogenation functional-
ity, an oxocarbenium intermediate similar to 3-HP could be readily
hydrogenated to form 1,3-PDO (Scheme 4.3) [314]. The most selec-
tive class of materials for 1,3-PDO production to date are Pt nanopar-
ticles on Brønsted acidic supports such as heteropolyacids, sulfated
zirconia (S-ZrO2), or WOx/boehmite, with maximum yields near 65%

Scheme 4.3. Glycerol conversion pathways: double dehydration over Brønsted acid
sites to acrolein, and hydrogenation of intermediate 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde to
1,3-propanediol. Adapted from Refs. [314,316].

P[154,314,318(cid:1)320]. Quantitative in situ NH3 adsorption FTIR has
shown that the presence of Pt on these surfaces substantially
increases the density of Brønsted acid sites. For example, pure
S-ZrO2 has a BAS density of 464 mmol/gcat, which increases to
804 mmol/gcat after deposition of Pt nanoparticles. 1,3-PDO selectiv-
ity over Pt/S-ZrO2 scales roughly linearly with surface BAS density
from 50% to 84%, suggesting direct involvement of Brønsted acid
sites in the mechanism [321]. H spillover from the Pt particles to the
support is proposed as the mechanism for the increased acid site
density and has been proposed to be critical to 1,3-PDO selectivity
[314,322(cid:1)326]. The KIE of »2, analysis of 3-hydroxypropionalde-
hyde activity, and activity correlation with BAS density all support
the dehydration-hydrogenation mechanism of glycerol hydrogenol-
ysis to 1,3-PDO.

PA direct hydrogenolysis mechanism involving regioselective
hydride attack after heterolytic H2 cleavage over the noble metal
was also proposed for glycerol and THFA conversion based on kinetic
investigations [205(cid:1)207,327]. Using target reactants, e.g., glycerol,
THFA, or other cyclic ethers, the reaction rate order dependence on
the substrate is 0 at moderate to high concentrations. This is indica-
tive of strong surface-adsorbate interactions, proposed to be the
result of alkoxy formation on the Me2Ox moiety [207]. In the hydro-
genolysis of linear ethers, applied as a model reaction, the relative
reaction rates do not follow the carbenium ion stability trend typical
of Brønsted acid-catalyzed mechanisms, i.e., more substituted cati-
ons are more stable. This suggests that the RLS does not involve a
carbenium ion as previously proposed. Additionally, the inclusion of
homogeneous acids, e.g., H2SO4, in the reaction solution had a negli-
gible impact on reaction rates, in contrast to the BAS dependence
reported elsewhere [328]. Results when using substrates with par-
ticular geometric configurations led to the proposal of regioselective
hydride attack (Scheme 4.4). Although 1,2-cyclohexanediols (both
cis and trans) contain hydroxyl groups a to one another, overall rates
and hydrogenolysis selectivities were lower than observed with
THFA. THFA conversion shows first-order dependence on H2, but
this order dependence is negative for 1,2-cyclohexanediol reactions,

Pthe cycloaddition and dehydration steps in the DMF-ethylene sys-
tem have been calculated to be 100(cid:1)140 kJ/mol and 240(cid:1)260 kJ/
mol, making use of a catalyst necessary to achieve appreciable rates
[331(cid:1)333]. Brønsted acidic zeolites such as H-Y, H-Beta, and H-
ZSM-5 have shown up to 90% selectivity to p-xylene at differential
DMF conversions in liquid-phase reactions using a hydrocarbon sol-
vent [331,334]. Experiments at various acid site concentrations
show two distinct kinetic regimes: dehydration-limited at low acid
site concentrations (< 1 mM), and cycloaddition-limited at high acid
concentrations (> 5 mM), indicating that Brønsted acid sites are
much more effective at catalyzing dehydration than cycloaddition.
At low acid concentration, the measured reaction orders are 0.5 for
DMF and 1 for ethylene, consistent with reactant-cycloadduct equi-
librium due to limiting dehydration, and the apparent activation bar-
rier (Ea,app) was measured to be 45 § 8.8 kJ/mol, a »200 kJ/mol
reduction from the uncatalyzed barrier. At high acid concentration,
first-order kinetics in both DMF and ethylene are observed and mea-
sured Ea,app = 84 § 5 kJ/mol, indicating the change to a cycloaddition-
limited regime [335,336]. Although the cycloaddition barrier
appears slightly reduced, complimentary calculations and investiga-
tions suggest that Brønsted acidic zeolites do not appreciably accel-
erate this step. Kinetic models with this assumption reproduce
experimental data accurately, lending support to this hypothesis
[335(cid:1)337]. Despite the high selectivity achieved with DMF,
Brønsted acidic zeolites are unselective for furanics without sub-
stituents protecting both the C1 and C4 positions. Over H-Beta, selec-
tivities for 2-MF to toluene and furan to benzene are reduced to 48%
and 25%, respectively, due to polymerization and ring-opening side
reactions [334,337]. Experimentally, the rate constant of 2-MF ring-
opening hydrolysis over Brønsted acid sites is »9 orders of magni-
tude larger than the rate constant for cycloaddition with ethylene,
suggesting selectivity from this approach is fundamentally limited
[337,338]. Therefore, reduction in the strength of catalytic Brønsted
acid sites could have a positive effect on the reaction selectivity, as
side reactions would be less facile. A new class of phosphorus-con-
taining MFI or BEA zeolite materials exhibit very weak Brønsted acid
sites. These materials display »95% selectivity to p-xylene from
DMF, but rates appear to be low and testing on 2-MF or furan has
not been reported [339]. Overall, investigations with Brønsted acidic
zeolites shows that the Diels-Alder chemistry proceeds in two sepa-
rately catalyzed steps, cycloaddition and dehydration, only the latter
of which is accelerated by acid catalysis.

PKinetic analysis is a fundamental tool in catalysis, and in some
cases the only reliable method for obtaining mechanistic insight in
complex reaction systems. Models developed from mechanistic
investigations and parameterized with kinetic data aid in the optimi-
zation of reaction conditions and process design to achieve the high-
est possible yields. Kinetic analysis can also shed light on liquid-
phase reactions mechanisms, which are difficult to probe with other
experimental
techniques. Although some ambiguity regarding
mechanistic conclusions is occasionally present, using fundamental
kinetics to investigate reaction mechanism will continue to be a

Pindicative of different reaction mechanisms [205,206]. Much higher
hydrogenolysis rates are observed when using substrates with two
oxygen atoms capable of attaining an “anti”-conformation than
when the reactant is incapable of this conformation (Scheme 4.5).
1,2-cyclohexanediol has 2 adjacent chiral centers locking the
hydroxyl groups into a gauche conformation, and the altered reac-
tion kinetics suggest a less selective pathway is present in the con-
version of this species. The necessity of the anti-conformation leads
directly to the proposal of regioselective (i.e., back-side) hydride
attack, with the anion generated via heterolytic H2 cleavage on the
noble metal moiety. The oxophilic metal plays a critical role in this
pathway, anchoring the substrate to the surface via alkoxy formation
and allowing hydride attack at the adjacent C(cid:1)O bond, followed by
protonation to complete the mechanism. Species such as furan
with no anchoring hydroxyl group react at much lower rates (e.g.,
THFA TOF = 609 h¡1, furan TOF = 15 h¡1) [206]. A detailed kinetic
model based on the proposed mechanism was developed for
THFA ring-opening, with excellent agreement between the model
and experimental results, validating the proposed mechanism
[207].

P4.2.2. Synthesis of aromatics from furanics over zeolites

PAnalysis of the kinetic behavior of Diels-Alder cycloaddition of
DMF and ethylene to generate para-xylene (p-xylene) reveals that
either the cycloaddition or dehydration step can be rate-limiting
depending on the reaction conditions. Benzene, toluene, and xylenes
(BTX) are bulk petrochemical molecules produced world-wide, and
an active and selective renewable route to these molecules from bio-
mass-derived feedstocks would be a major step towards the sustain-
able production of commodity chemicals [1,5,50,70,329,330]. The
Diels-Alder synthesis of BTX and derivatives from furanics is a prom-
ising approach via a two-step mechanism: a furanic diene reacts
with a dienophile to form a cycloadduct with an oxygen bridge that
is subsequently dehydrated to the target aromatic molecule
(Scheme 4.6). The most studied system is the reaction of DMF with
ethylene to form p-xylene. The uncatalyzed activation barriers for

media.

5. Synthesis of catalysts with tailored composition and structure

PDeveloping synthetic methods to prepare materials with con-
trolled composition and structure has two vital roles in catalyst
development: (1) realizing precise molecular arrangements based
on catalyst design parameters; and (2) aiding in the establishment of
reliable structure-activity relations. Recent developments in materi-
als synthesis have enabled structural control at both the micro- and
meso-scales, from molecular construction of surface composition
and configuration to crystalline micro- and mesoporous materials
with highly ordered structures [340(cid:1)342]. New materials that incor-
porate the principles of molecular catalysts and functional supports
while also controlling reaction media at the nano-scale are blurring
the boundary between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis
[343]. This level of control enables bottom-up catalyst synthesis and
tuning of surface sites to accurately meet design parameters, which
benefits heterogeneous catalysis in general. A subset of new materi-
als and synthetic strategies specifically target the particular chal-
lenges of upgrading biomass-based feedstocks, whose chemical
properties pose substantial design challenges [340(cid:1)342]. Catalysts
for condensed-phase reactions, common in biomass valorization,
must be highly active because the thermal instability of many sub-
strates limits reaction temperature, and also resistant to solvent-
induced deactivation processes [86]. Physical access to the surface
or framework active site presents another challenge due to the bulky
sterics of oxygenated and/or branched feedstocks [49]. Composite
catalysts for deoxygenation processes can also facilitate reactive sep-
arations, as the physicochemical properties of the reactants and
products can differ significantly [344(cid:1)346].

5.1. Molecular-level control of active sites

PTuning of surface functionality through materials synthesis is key
to obtaining high selectivity in reactions of multifunctional sub-
strates and can be achieved with high precision through control of
heteroatom substitution in zeolitic frameworks or atomic layer
deposition (ALD) synthesis techniques. Mechanistic studies of bio-
mass upgrading reactions imply that catalyst selectivity is often
dependent on highly specific surface functionalities and/or substrate
adsorption configurations [1,347]. To effectively exercise selectivity
control, catalytic materials must be synthesized that reliably match
specifications or parameters drawn from insights into reaction
mechanism. Achieving the desired site functionality often requires
molecular- or even atomic-level control over the structure and com-
position of surface or framework structures [340,348]. Controlling
the identity of the heteroatom in zeolite materials provides a handle
for fine-tuning the acidic character of the framework, while ALD
allows for precise construction of the composition and structure of
nanoparticles or surface layers.

P5.1.1. Controlled heteroatom incorporation in zeotype materials

PChanging the framework heteroatom in substituted zeolites pro-
vides control over the acidity of the material, including strength of
Brønsted acid sites, nature of Lewis acid sites, and proximity of sites
to facilitate cascade chemistry. Zeolitic materials are widely used in
the petrochemical industry, particularly frameworks with the strong
Brønsted acidic character necessary to facilitate reactions common
in hydrocarbon processing,
isomerization
e.g.,
[29,349,350]. Strong BAS often lead to coking or polymerization
with biomass-based substrates such as furanics, and thus tuning the
acidity on zeolites could be critical [62,67,338]. Further, many bio-
mass conversions are selectively catalyzed only by Lewis acid sites,

cracking or

Pwhich makes zeolites substituted with tetravalent heteroatoms a
particularly interesting group of catalysts. Confinement effects
within the micropores of zeolite frameworks have also been pro-
posed to stabilize transition states in a manner similar to liquid sol-
vents, increasing rates for important reactions such as dehydration,
making these materials excellent candidates for biomass upgrading
reactions [351(cid:1)355].

PThe framework incorporation of a trivalent element other than
Al, i.e., Ga, Fe, or B, has been shown by both computational and
experimental studies to produce weaker Brønsted acid sites, i.e.,
sites with higher deprotonation energy [354,356(cid:1)360]. This is an
effective strategy for reducing aromatics formation (via strong acid
sites) in the methanol-to-olefins reaction, but current applications
in biomass-to-chemicals upgrading show mixed results. For exam-
ple, H-[Al]-Beta and H-[B]-Beta show no significant differences in
selectivity or activity when catalyzing the Diels-Alder cycloaddition
of furan or DMF [359,361,362]. The substitution of phosphate groups
for Al in BEA (P-BEA) and self-pillared pentasil (P-SPP) frameworks
generates a material with very weak Brønsted acid sites that
are unable to catalyze common model reactions such as the decom-
position of propylamine [339,363]. P-BEA and P-SPP show unique
selectivity for dehydra-decyclization reactions converting tetrahy-
drofurans to valuable dienes,
including THF to butadiene (85%
selectivity) and 3-methyl-THF to isoprene (70% selectivity) with
minimal
formation of ketone or humin-based side products
[163,337(cid:1)339,364,365]. In Al-form zeolites, replacing the proton
with alkali-metal cations alters the acid/base properties substan-
tially, for instance increased basic character in Ce/H faujasite crack-
ing catalysts [66]. In the dehydration of methyl lactate, NaY behaves
as a bifunctional material: the framework acts as a base by accepting
a proton from the substrate or solvent, while the Lewis acid func-
tionality (attributed to Na+ in zeolite pores) catalyzes dehydration
(Section 2.1.3) [148,150].

PIncorporation of tetravalent heteroatoms, e.g., Ti, Sn, Zr, and Hf,
into zeolite frameworks produces Lewis acid sites with unique prop-
erties as a result of the microporous framework environment [62].
Lewis acidic zeolites provide higher selectivities, yields, and/or rates
than common acid catalysts, e.g., Brønsted acidic materials, homoge-
neous Lewis acids, and salts, for a number of biomass valorization
reactions, including: (1) sugar isomerizations, e.g., glucose to fruc-
tose [366,367]; (2) selective hydrogenations, e.g., catalytic transfer
hydrogenation of FAL to 2-MF or methyl
levulinate to GVL
[302,305]; (3) Diels-Alder synthesis of aromatics from furanics and a
variety of dienophiles [67,368(cid:1)370]; (4) retro-aldol condensation
reactions for transforming hexoses and pentoses to C2, C3 and C4
platforms [371,372]; and (5) Lebedev coupling of ethanol to butadi-
ene [373]. Moreover, a specific heteroatom is often the most active
and/or selective for a given reaction, e.g., Sn for glucose isomeriza-
tion, Hf for levulinate reduction, and Ta for ethanol coupling, sug-
gesting that subtle differences in heteroaom properties can have
outsize effects on catalytic activity [305,373,374]. The synthesis
method can also provide control over the hydrophobic/hydrophilic
properties of the framework, preventing poisoning of Lewis acid
centers by the solvent used in the reaction, e.g., by strong H2O
adsorption in aqueous environments [375]. Synthesis and inves-
tigation of tetravalently-substituted zeolites remains an active
area of study,
in particular to observe differences in catalytic
activity between hydrolyzed “open” framework sites and tetrahe-
drally bonded “closed” sites. “Open” and “closed” framework
sites in Sn-Beta have been proposed to catalyze glucose isomeri-
zation to fructose and epimerization to mannose, respectively,
illustrating the potential impacts of atomic arrangement at active
centers in catalytic materials [374,377(cid:1)379]. Understanding the
effect of each site type on catalysis is often key to understanding
reaction mechanism and/or rationally designing more effective
materials.

PBifunctional zeolite frameworks containing both trivalent and
tetravalent centers such as Sn/Al-Beta or Zr/Al-Beta have also been
synthesized for “cascade” conversions which require both Brønsted
and Lewis acid centers in close proximity. Reaction chains with both
Brønsted acid-catalyzed, e.g., dehydration or condensation, and
Lewis acid-catalyzed, e.g., isomerization or hydride transfer, steps
can be performed in one-pot “cascade” systems over single catalyst
beds with mixed active sites, obtaining higher yields than over phys-
ical catalyst mixtures while reducing the need for separation steps.
Examples include (1) direct GVL production from furan ethers over
Sn/Al-Beta [376] and xylose over Zr/Al-Beta [380]; (2) glycerol/dihy-
droxyacetone to methyl lactate over Sn/Al-Beta [381,382]; and (3)
production of furanic ethers (potential fuel additives) from FAL over
Sn/Al-Beta (Scheme 5.1) [383]. Divalent Zn can also be incorporated
into frameworks such as CIT-6, providing a (cid:1)2 framework charge,
which can be balanced by either mono- or divalent cations. These
materials have shown promise for Diels-Alder cycloaddition reac-
tions of furans with ethylene to yield aromatics, although a compu-
tational study suggests that inherent heterogeneity of active sites
around Zn atoms may complicate the development of structure-
activity relationships [384,385]. The incorporation of heteroatoms
other than Al into zeolite and zeotype frameworks provides intricate

Pcontrol over a material's acidic properties, leading to a group of
materials that are highly selective for deoxygenation processes.

P5.1.2. Atomic layer deposition for controlled catalyst synthesis

PAtomic layer deposition (ALD), a vapor phase deposition tech-
nique wherein discrete amounts of chemical precursors are intro-
duced through a controlled pulsing procedure, enables
the
preparation of atomically precise nanoparticles or surface layers
with constituent elements from across the periodic table [340,386].
ALD is similar to physical and chemical vapor deposition, but offers
more precise control of the resulting structures because the two-
step procedure is inherently self-limiting. In the first half-reaction, a
single layer of a metal precursor is deposited. In the second half-
reaction, the precursor is modified, e.g., oxidized, to regenerate the
surface functional groups to react with the metal precursor in
the next cycle (Fig. 5.1) [340]. The precision of ALD enables reli-
able synthesis of uniform mono- and bimetallic nanoparticles
with controlled morphologies. Important configurations such as
core-shell particles can be assembled through directed precursor
deposition. Although granular control of surface composition is

cations to biomass valorization have not yet been demonstrated

context of biomass
upgrading, depositing “overlayers” of metal oxide over metallic
nanoparticles with ALD has led to increased deactivation resis-
tance in liquid-phase reactions.

In the

PThin oxide overlayers deposited by ALD can protect metal nano-
particles from the sintering and leaching processes that cause
deactivation of nanoparticle catalysts in liquid-phase reactions,
improving catalyst lifetime [397,398]. Supported nanoparticle Cu on
Al2O3 is selective for FAL hydrogenation to FOL, but suffers from
rapid deactivation and poor recyclability because irreversible
agglomeration of Cu into larger particles permanently decreases the
active surface area [399]. After deposition of a thin AlOx overlayer,
catalyst activity is completely retained through multiple recycles.
Selectivity remains high, but the turnover frequency (normalized by
the number of exposed Cu atoms on the overlayer-free nanoparticle)
decreases by a factor of »1.5, likely due to AlOx blocking a fraction of
active sites [340,400]. Low-coordination, high-energy sites on nano-
particle surfaces are generally believed to be responsible for agglom-
eration and leaching processes. Spectroscopic and DFT investigations
both indicate that AlOx overlayers selectively bond to these low-
coordination sites in the AlOx/Cu/Al2O3 system, thus eliminating the
particle nucleation sites which lead to sintering and agglomeration
[396,398,399,401,402]. Similar activity stabilization has been
observed with other overlayer/metal combinations, including AlOx/
Pd, AlOx/Pt, TiOx/Co, AlOx/Ni, and TiOx/Ni, attesting to the generality
of this strategy (Fig. 5.2) [396,403(cid:1)407]. The composition of the
overlayer-metal-support combination must be chosen carefully, as
some species can form non-catalytic alloy phases. For example, Co/
Al2O3 with an AlOx overlayer formed an Co-Al alloy which exhibited
no catalytic activity for FOL hydrogenation to THFA, but a TiOx coat-
ing provided Co nanoparticle stabilization with minimal activity loss
[406]. Oxide overlayers can also completely block active sites with-
out post-ALD thermal treatments that form pores in the overcoat
layer for diffusion to/from active sites. The re-shaping process for
AlOx and TiOx films has been characterized in detail by X-ray scatter-
ing [408]. Overlayer functionalization can also meaningfully alter
catalytic activity, demonstrated in reactions of furanics. Overcoats of
MgO impart basic functionality suppresses acid-catalyzed furan
decomposition, while NbOx adds acidic functionality that promotes
chain-extending etherification reactions, show the utility of ALD for
the systematic development of bi- and multi-functional surfaces
[409(cid:1)411]. While ALD overlayers can decrease intrinsic catalytic
activity, the selective bonding to high-energy surface sites reduces
nanoparticle agglomeration, extending catalyst lifetime and regen-
eration capability.

5.2. Active site accessibility control

PThe steric bulk of biomass-derived substrates and the adsorption
configuration-sensitive nature of upgrading reactions demand con-
trol over physical access to active sites. While site functionality in
zeolites and other surfaces can be controlled via the synthesis tech-
niques described above, physical access of the substrate to active
sites requires engineering of the framework or the crystal structure.
The bulky species common in biomass are often sterically unable to
enter the micropores of zeolites, limiting reaction to acid sites
located on the external surface of crystals [308]. Introducing hierar-
chically structured meso- and macroporous domains increases the
number of external sites which bulky substrates such as sugars can
access [346]. Functionalization of the surface with alkyl thiolates or
ALD overlayers restricts functional group access to surface active
sites and improves selectivity for reactions which are governed by
the adsorption configuration of intermediates, e.g., HDO of furanics.

P5.2.1. Hierarchical zeotype materials

PZeotype materials with hierarchical structure combine the
hydrothermal stability and well-defined active sites of crystalline
frameworks with enhanced accessibility and utilization of active
sites through the introduction of meso- or macroporous domains
[345,346,350,412(cid:1)414]. The development of hierarchical materials
is a highly productive field of research, and here we highlight only a
few notable examples where the introduction of pore hierarchy
improved catalytic activity or selectivity for reactions relevant to
biomass upgrading. More comprehensive reviews covering synthesis
techniques, nucleation and growth mechanisms, and broader sur-
veys of materials and applications can be found in the literature
[342,345,346,413(cid:1)417].

the three-dimensional zeolite crystal

PHierarchically structured zeolite materials with nanosheet, lay-
ered, or pillared organization on the meso- to macroscale dramati-
cally increase the reaction rates for the conversion of bulky
substrates by increasing the fraction of active sites located at the
external surface. Delamination procedures deconstruct zeolite crys-
tals into thin “nanosheets”, which organize randomly in the final
material without long-range order [422(cid:1)424]. Engineered struc-
ture-directing agents can now be used to directly synthesize nano-
sheets of commonly used zeolite frameworks, with controlled
thickness down to as few as 1.5 unit cells [420,425(cid:1)427]. Using
nanosheet MFI (thickness = 2.5 nm) for the Diels-Alder synthesis of
p-xylene from DMF led to a reaction rate 3 times higher than a com-
mercial MFI sample, and more than 4 orders of magnitude higher
than a bulk MFI synthesized with large crystallites (»500 nm) with
similar selectivity, suggesting that in standard MFI a significant frac-
tion of
is not utilized
(Scheme 5.2a) [418]. By intercalating flexible organic or rigid inor-
ganic structures between nanosheets, “layered” or “pillared” zeolites
with ordered meso- or macroporous structures can be generated
[414,423,425,426,428(cid:1)434]. Mesoporous or pillared zeolites with
Brønsted acid character are more effective supports for metal nano-
particles than standard microporous materials. Higher rates and
HDO selectivity of
lignin-derived guaiacol and syringols were
observed when Ru nanoparticles were supported on hierarchically
structured MFI than on standard MFI, where the bulky oxygenates
cannot enter the microporous domains (Scheme 5.2b) [419]. Nano-
sheet MFI is also effective for important industrial chemistries,
including Claisen-Schmidt condensation of benzaldehyde and 2-
hydroxyacetophenone to flavanone (used in cosmetics) and Beck-
mann rearrangement of cyclohexanoneoxime to e-caprolactam
(used in textiles), and upstream biomass processing such as hydroly-
sis of polymeric inulin to fructose (Scheme 5.2) [420,421,435]. Hier-
archical Lewis acidic zeolites such as self-pillared Sn-MFI are much
more active for sugar isomerization, especially of glucose to fructose,
than standard Sn-substituted zeolites as a result of improved active

Pand thus they could be more broadly applicable in biomass upgrad-
ing reactions, such as aldehyde reductions, epoxide chemistry, and
olefin hydrogenation as well as alkyl chemistries [400,453].

5.3. Multi-domain catalysts

PMaterials specifically engineered to control the reaction media, i.
e., solvents, around reactants and products can improve selectivity
and facilitate reactive separations. Multiple reaction steps are
needed in most, if not all, biomass-to-chemicals conversions, and
thus catalytic materials that facilitate “cascade” or “tandem” chemis-
try and reactive separations can enhance the overall economic feasi-
bility of valorization processes. A number of materials that take
advantage of substrate and product solvation properties to improve
selectivity control have been developed, including emulsion-stabi-
lizing bimodal nanoparticles and functionalized inorganic structures.
Emulsion catalysts simultaneously improve liquid-liquid contact for
effective reactant diffusion, separate reactants and products with
differing solvation characteristics, and perform selective deoxygen-
ation by controlling the of immediate environment of the active
phase. Organosiliceous or micellar catalysts also provide physical
separation of active phases, allowing for incompatible functionali-
ties, e.g., acid and base, to coexist in the same material.

P5.3.1. Emulsion-stabilizing materials

PMany biomass conversion reactions are conducted in the liquid
phase with the presence of one or more solvents, and the polarity
match/mismatch among substrates, intermediates, products and sol-
vents can be exploited with bimodal emulsion catalysts. Currently,
liquid-phase reactions often use surfactants to improve liquid-liquid
contact and disperse catalyst, but these chemicals are often expen-
sive and/or toxic [454]. Emulsion catalysts are bimodal nano-
structured materials generally consisting of hydrophobic, e.g.,
carbonaceous, and hydrophilic, e.g., metal oxide, domains, which not
only stabilize liquid-liquid emulsions of insoluble species but also
support catalytically active metal particles [455,456]. Metal nano-
particles, e.g., Pd, can be directed to a specific phase via specialized
deposition techniques, which serves to separate desired products
from the active sites as a result of phase distribution. For example,
with Pd only deposited on the silica phase of carbon-SiO2 bimodal
particles, HDO of aqueously solvated vanillin to 2-methoxy-p-cresol
in a water/decalin emulsion proceeds at >90% selectivity. Over-
hydrogenation is avoided because »90% of the product automati-
cally distributes in the organic phase, where it cannot access Pd par-
ticles (Scheme 5.3a) [344]. By contrast, deposition of Pd on only the
carbonaceous phase promotes organic-phase reactions: benzalde-
hyde (organic) hydrogenation proceeds at >95% conversion while
glutaraldehyde (aqueous) conversion is negligible (Scheme 5.3b)
[457,459]. Changing the oxide phase to basic MgO makes the catalyst
highly active for base-catalyzed aqueous aldol condensation reac-
tions of FAL with chain-extending oxygenates for the synthesis of
fuel additives, which distribute into the organic phase, preventing
further reaction (Scheme 5.3c) [458]. Additionally, silica particles
with functionalized domains can provide emulsion stabilization and
catalysis in non-aqueous biphasic mixtures, such as the solvent-free
acetalization of immiscible long-chain fatty aldehydes and ethylene
glycol [460]. The use of bimodal catalysts in biphasic systems is an
effective approach for selective deoxygenation of biomass-derived
species as well as reactive separation.

P5.3.2. Micellar and organosiliceous materials

PSilica-based and micellar materials with multiple embedded cat-
alytic functionalities are excellent materials for “cascade” chemistry
steps are achieved in “one-pot”
wherein multiple chemical
[60,463,464]. Similar to emulsion materials, micellar catalysts can
provide physical isolation of the active phase, protecting sensitive

Psite accessibility for the bulky hexose substrates [436,437]. Interest-
ingly, studies suggest that when possible, activity in hierarchical
materials is still dominated by the internal sites, possibly due to “sol-
vation” effects in the microporous environment [438,439]. The broad
applicability for biomass upgrading due to the flexibility of hierar-
chical zeolites is clear, and the focus on the customization of the cat-
alyst structure for specific applications could be key to unlocking the
full potential of these materials [308,345].

P5.2.2. Metal surface modification

PMechanistic studies have shown that adsorption configuration is
highly predictive of selectivity for biomass-derived substrates, and
functionalization of metal surfaces with self-assembled thiolate
monolayers or porous ALD overlayers direct substrate adsorption
configuration in order to exercise selectivity control [400,440]. Noble
metal surfaces typically have high sulfur binding energies, and
therefore long or bulky thiol-terminated alkanes, e.g., octadecane or
adamantine, can be used to pack the surface of the metal. The surface
crowding hinders adsorption configurations of intermediates with a
large surface footprint difficult [441]. The thiolates self-assemble
into ordered, consistent monolayer surface structures with organiza-
tion driven by the van der Waals interactions among the alkyl tails
[442(cid:1)445]. Compared to non-functionalized metal surfaces, selec-
tivity to hydrogenation or hydrogenolysis products from furan- or
benzene-based oxygenates such as furfuryl or benzyl alcohol
increases with thiolate alkyl chain length, at the expense of decar-
bonylation and ring chemistries. Kinetic experiments show no
change in activation barriers, so selectivity changes can be entirely
attributed to changes in adsorption configuration [446(cid:1)450]. Thiol-
grafting techniques can be combined with ALD to generate selective
sieving overcoats wherein deposited metal oxide layer(s) accumu-
late around a sacrificial organic species. After thermal and oxidative
treatments, the oxide overcoat is left with pores whose size and
shape mimic the removed organic species, only allowing molecules
of a particular structure to diffuse to the active sites below. In one
proof of concept study, selectivity for photocatalytic reactions of
benzyl alcohol were improved in contrast to the significant reduc-
tion of activity for adamantane-based substrates [451,452]. ALD
sieving layers are more thermally stable than thiolate monolayers,

via acid-catalyzed deacetalization followed by (top) reduction to benzyl alcohol with
NaBH [461], or (bottom) ethyl 2-benzelydene acetoacetate via base-catalyzed Knoe-
venagel condensation [462].

Pboth functionalized organic species and rigid silica domains, e.g.,
layers, pillars, and core-shell configurations, hold the most promise
for important biomass-to-chemicals cascade reactions because they
are characterized by: (1) the presence of both meso- and micropo-
rous domains to facilitate transport, (2) molecular control of both
active site distribution and nature (acid/base strength), (3) straight-
forward synthesis, and (4) solvothermal stability [60,430,472,473]. A
recent example using carbon nanotubes in place of silica provided
excellent yields in a deacetalization-Knoevenagel cascade reaction
along with excellent thermal stability and transport properties
[474].

5.4. Deactivation-resistant catalysts

PMechanistic understanding of catalyst deactivation and develop-
ing strategies to prepare stable catalysts are no less important than
investigations of catalytic activity and selectivity in practice, but
deactivation processes are often overlooked in academic research
[475]. Causes of catalyst deactivation in the condensed phase, where
many biomass upgrading reactions must be conducted, are not
nearly as well understood as the analogous gas-phase processes, e.g.,
coking. Several recent reviews covered catalyst hydrothermal stabil-
ity, active site leaching, and key experimental procedures for investi-
gating condensed-phase deactivation, and have called for these
processes to receive more attention from the research community at
large [397,476,477]. Here, we briefly discuss studies focused on
hydrothermal degradation, leaching, and fouling or poisoning and
highlight materials synthesis approaches to mitigating these issues.
PA variety of synthesis techniques focused on coating or overlayer
deposition have been developed to mitigate hydrothermal degrada-
tion and leaching of metal oxide supports and catalytically active
species, respectively. Reactions in the aqueous phase at elevated
temperature and/or pressure are common in biomass upgrading and
place significant stress on the catalytic material, resulting in degra-
dation or leaching and in turn catalyst deactivation [397,478]. Since
water is present in many reaction systems, hydrolysis of metal-oxy-
gen bonds with adjacent hydrophilic sites, i.e., hydroxyl groups, is a
major mechanism for both degradation and leaching leading to
deactivation [476,478]. Introducing hydrophobic domains has been
shown to effectively mitigate degradation in a number of cases: (1)
Embedding metal oxide nanoparticles in carbon matrices [476] (2)
organosilane-functionalization of zeolites, generating hydrother-
mally stable emulsion catalysts [479]; and (3) coating ordered meso-
porous silica supports, e.g., SBA-15, with thin films of sucrose or
polyfurfuryl, with only a minimal impact on the accessibility of cata-
lytic sites and mass transport [480,481]. Leaching can also be

Pspecies from conversion while reducing the need for expensive or
toxic surfactants [463]. Micelles which totally encapsulate the active
phase can be considered as “nanoreactors” and are used to prevent
undesired solvent or substrate interactions with the active site
[465,466]. Multi-compartmentalized micelles physically isolate
incompatible functionalities, i.e., acidic sites in one micelle and basic
sites in another, while keeping the sites in proximity to one another
for effective cascade chemistry (Scheme 5.4). These catalysts are
evaluated using test reactions, notably acidic deacetalization, e.g., of
benzaldehyde dimethyl acetal (BDA), followed by base-catalyzed
reactions such as reduction by NaBH4 or Knoevenagel condensation.
The high selectivities and conversions achieved for BDA to reduced
benzyl alcohol or condensation derivatives show promise for sub-
strates with similar sizes and functionalities [461,467]. Similarly,
organosiliceous materials provide highly tunable functionalities via
the selection of grafted groups, most commonly acidic, e.g., SO3H,
and basic groups, e.g., NH2 [60]. The organic group used to connect
the functional species to the siliceous base, or linker, can alter cata-
lytic properties in tandem reactions where multiple functionalities
operate simultaneously [462,468(cid:1)471]. Organosiliceous materials
also have potential as biphasic catalysts, as the identity and charac-
ter of the grafted groups can be used to selectively tune solvation
properties, e.g., densely populating the silica surface with organic
groups adds hydrophobic character [59,460]. Organic-inorganic
hybrid materials with meso-scale ordered structures, which contain

Pmitigated through ALD overcoating, and newly demonstrated liquid-
phase layer-by-layer deposition methods appear to reduce activity
loss from the overcoat, e.g., an overcoated Cu/Al2O3 catalyst for FAL
hydrogenation demonstrates <20% rate decrease and no loss of
activity upon recycle [482,483].

PCatalyst fouling, generally due to the generation of humins, and
active site poisoning are under-studied topics in biomass upgrading.
Efforts to characterize the molecular structure of humins have
shown that the specific polymeric structure of a deposit is strongly
affected by the choice of reactant and solvent [163,484,485], as well
as conditions such as temperature and pressure. Humins have been
shown to form via Brønsted acid-catalyzed condensation, dehydra-
tion, and etherification reactions, and reducing acid strength and/or
substituting Lewis acid sites for Brønsted acid sites have been sug-
gested as strategies for mitigating humin formation [163]. Process
engineering is another effective strategy for minimizing humin
deposition, particularly working with diluted streams or operating
at lower temperatures to reduce the rate of humin-forming reactions
[475,478]. Biomass streams generally contain a broad variety of
impurities, including sulfur-containing compounds, alkali and alka-
line earth metals, and trace heavy metals [475]. Sulfur poisoning can
be alleviated by substituting metal carbides, e.g., MoxC, for metals
such as nickel or platinum [453,486]. Alkali and alkaline earth
metals are known to promote char formation during biomass
gasification/pyrolysis but no systematic study of their impact on
downstream processes has been undertaken [487,488]. Generally,
understanding of the mechanisms behind liquid-phase catalyst
deactivation is still at an early stage, and more investigation into
the effect of common impurities on catalyst activity, selectivity
and stability is warranted.

PDevelopment of synthetic strategies to prepare catalytic materi-
als with complex and well controlled composition and structure is
an enabling step in the cycle of rational catalyst design. Individual
strategies outlined in this section have made substantial progress
in improving various aspects of biomass upgrading reactions, and it
is reasonable to surmise that novel catalytic materials with
improved performance could be developed by combining two or
more strategies.

6. Perspective

PIn the last few decades, focus on catalytic biomass upgrading has
led to significant improvements in selectivity for reactions convert-
ing multifunctional biomass-derived feedstocks to bulk and spe-
cialty chemicals. Case studies examined in this review highlight that
in situ/operando spectroscopies, predictive computational modeling,
rigorous kinetic investigations, and controlled materials synthesis
have been the foundational techniques in the development of state
of the art catalytic systems. Bulk chemicals such as aromatics, alky-
lated furans, a,v-diols, dienes, and acrylates can now be produced
selectively from multifunctional starting materials derived from bio-
mass, e.g., substituted furanics and phenolics, sugars, or short-chain
polyols and carboxylic acids. Structure-activity relations for the
selective activation of characteristic bonds, established via the
approaches discussed in this article, played a vital role in the rational
development of the tailored catalysts used to achieve these transfor-
mations. Meanwhile, many key aspects in catalytic biomass upgrad-
ing processes remain poorly understood, and the development of
new techniques and the integration of multiple current methodolo-
(1) developing
gies are needed. Current challenges include:
approaches which appropriately consider the complexities of cata-
lytic materials and biomass feedstocks (including impurities), rather
than simplified model compounds and systems; (2) understanding
and tailoring the interaction between reaction media, e.g., solvents,
and catalysts to enhance yields, simplify separation and facilitate
process integration; (3) predicting and synthesizing catalysts with

Pwell-defined composition and structure tailored for specific reac-
tions.

from their pretreatment

PThe complexity in the composition and structure of both sub-
strates and catalysts should be better reflected in mechanistic stud-
ies. To date, both experimental and computational studies of
biomass upgrading reactions have mostly employed simplified
model systems to establish structure-activity relations, which was
justified at the nascent state of the field. However, real-world feed-
stocks and catalysts present complexities relevant to catalyst activity
that such models cannot capture. Due to the biological source of the
constituents, biomass feeds are inherently heterogeneous in compo-
sition and structure, and thus investigations of realistic feeds, includ-
such as
ing common impurities
fractionation or depolymerization, are critical in evaluating potential
catalysts. The multifunctional nature of substrates often demands
several types of catalytic sites coexist on the surface to achieve the
desired activity and selectivity and to facilitate tandem reactions.
Meanwhile, single crystal metal surfaces and supported monometal-
lic nanoparticles are typically used as model catalysts, which miss
the subtle but critical interactions among different components at
interfacial sites, e.g., Me1(cid:1)Me2Ox materials. Thus, model catalysts
with more complex composition and structure are needed to pin-
point modes of interaction between the substrate functional groups
and surface sites that lead to the selective activation of specific
bonds. Similarly, interactions between metals and support materials,
e.g., Pd-ReOx supported on CeO2, are often the key to the catalytic
performance, and thus support effects either in interfacial regions,
on nanoparticle formulation, or as stand-alone catalysts should be
more explicitly considered. Further, precious metal based catalysts
have received more research focus as a result of high activities,
established synthetic methods for size and facet control, and ease in
computational modeling. Meanwhile, nonprecious metal based cata-
lysts are more industrially relevant, but difficulties in characterizing
and controlling their oxidation states and structures, especially
under reaction conditions, presents challenges to establishing con-
crete structure-activity relations. Characterization tools capable of
differentiating and quantifying multiple types of active sites under
reaction conditions are critical in understanding materials with com-
plex composition and structure. Further, systematically varying sur-
face properties with controlled synthesis will provide insight into
site-activity correlations, aiding in the design and synthesis of
improved catalysts. Although rigorous, this approach could prove
inadequate in exploring the vast parameter space of a multi-compo-
nent catalyst. Predictive computational modeling, including machine
learning techniques, should be developed based on existing experi-
mental insights to rapidly screen possible compositions/structures
and select a manageable number for experimental verification. Such
catalyst development cycle could start with precious metal based
catalysts on which experimental data are more readily available, and
then expand to base metals, oxides, or other formulations.

PThe medium in which a reaction is performed can have a pro-
found impact on its rate and product distribution, however, the sol-
vent effect remains poorly understood in general. Reactions of
thermally unstable oxygenates, to which most biomass derived
molecular belong, are often conducted in the liquid phase with sol-
vents. Solvents alter the energy of every species in the reaction sys-
tem,
i.e., reactants, transition states, products, active sites, and
causes of deactivation and thus have unpredictable effects on reac-
tion rates and selectivities. Difficulties in accurately modeling liq-
forces, multi-component adsorption
uid-phase intermolecular
properties, and catalyst-solvent interactions makes predicting the
overall effects of solvent choice challenging. Thus, developing
computational methods capable of accurately capturing the interac-
tion between the solvent and other species, e.g., active sites and
adsorbed intermediates, is highly desirable. In addition to high selec-
tivity, the drive to integrate reaction and separation steps in biomass

Pupgrading processes makes biphasic and multiphasic systems attrac-
tive options. At the same time, the operating environment of cata-
lysts in multiphasic systems could become ambiguous, which adds
to the uncertainty regarding interactions that impact the catalytic
performance in individual steps. In this regard, designing catalytic
materials with built-in components to take advantage of the multi-
phasic reaction media, e.g., functionalized biphasic emulsion-stabi-
lizing composites, biomimetic micellar systems, is an important
strategy for investigating solvent-catalyst relationships. The recogni-
tion that porous materials, e.g., zeolites, could function as “rigid” sol-
vents, has led to porous materials with engineered hydrophilic and
hydrophobic domains to separate reactants and products. Further
development in these concepts could allow controlled reaction cas-
cades guided by tailored domains with special properties in the cata-
lyst. Further, new techniques are required to probe these complex
systems, because multiple reactions are occurring simultaneously,
and isolating individual steps may not be trivial. In situ and operando
characterization techniques, coupled with selective poisoning of
specific active sites, could be helpful in elucidating the reaction net-
work and mechanistic pathways. Complementary computational
investigations could further shed light on the molecular level inter-
actions between substrates and various types of active sties present
in composite catalysts.

PBetter integration of computational and experimental investiga-
tions and use of information feedback loops could significantly accel-
erate the pace of catalyst discovery for biomass upgrade. While
computational chemistry has made huge strides in recent decades,
modeling the full complexity of biomass-derived feedstocks and cat-
alysts remains a daunting task. Although accurate and efficient ab
initio computational packages exist, predicting catalytic materials
for reactions without any experimental input is unrealistic and
unnecessary. Experimental results typically provide snapshots of a
catalytic system, providing boundary conditions and limitations that
dramatically reduce the required computational resources. While
development of computational models capable of learning from
ever-accumulating experimental data is acutely needed, experimen-
tal investigations should also strive to provide molecular level infor-
mation that can be readily incorporated in calculations, e.g.,
structure of reaction intermediates and catalytic sites, activation
energies and turnover frequencies. In addition, extending FPSEMs
such as LSRs for adsorption to complex surfaces, e.g., bi-/multi-met-
allics, supported nanoparticles and porous materials, is required to
support multi-scale approaches. Systematic experimental determi-
nation of adsorption energies of probe molecules with representa-
tive functional groups, e.g., CO, alcohols and aldehydes, could be
used to calibrate and evaluate semi-empirical methods. Once rea-
sonably accurate semi-empirical models are established for mole-
cules with functional groups common in biomass feedstocks, the
composition and structure of catalytic materials for a specific reac-
tion could be quickly narrowed down to a manageable set for experi-
mental verification. In the longer run, a comprehensive database of
catalytic materials could be compiled with all key descriptors calcu-
lated so that the future catalyst search could start with educated ini-
tial guesses.

the substantial

PThe activity and selectivity of catalysts used in biomass valo-
rization reactions have steadily improved over the last two deca-
des as a result of
research focus on this
challenge. The techniques outlined in this article played enabling
roles in obtaining mechanistic insights into key pathways and
guiding the design of catalytic materials. While there are still
many technical and economic roadblocks in the mass production
of biomass-based fuels and chemicals, the rapid advances in the
understanding of biomass upgrading processes suggest that with
continued efforts, there is much reason to be optimistic about a
sustainable chemicals industry based on renewably-sourced bio-
mass feedstocks.
