The cyanonitrene radical, NCN, has been shown in the last two decades to play a crucial role in the formation of 
prompt-NO  in  combustion.  This  has  stimulated  a  large  number  of  experimental  and  theoretical  studies  on 
fundamental physico-chemical properties of NCN as well as on mechanistic and kinetic aspects of NCN reactions 
under  combustion  conditions.  In  this  review,  spectroscopic,  thermodynamic,  and  kinetic  data  of  NCN  are 
collected and discussed. Methodic approaches for the detection of NCN in flames and in kinetic experiments are 
elucidated,  and  the  suitability  of  cyanogen  azide,  NCN3,  as  a  precursor  for  NCN  in  kinetic  experiments  is 
examined.  Kinetic  and  mechanistic  aspects  of  a  number  of  NCN  elementary  chemical  steps  are  extensively 
reviewed. Regarding prompt-NO formation, the role of the reaction network initialized by the reaction CH + N2 
⇌ NCN + H is examined by modeling measured flame profiles of NCN, HCN, and NO. In these simulations, the 
critical  role  of  the  product  channel-branching  of  the  NCN  + H  reaction,  termed  the  prompt-NO  switch,  is 
confirmed. A particularly sensitive balance is observed between the product channels leading back to CH + N2 or 
forward to HCN + N. The roles of spin conservation and intersystem crossing processes under flame conditions 
and  in  kinetic  experiments  with  NCN3  as  NCN  precursor  are  highlighted.  A  number  of  critical  points  and 
remaining open problems in NCN chemistry and prompt-NO formation are indicated.   

1. Introduction 

The  cyanonitrene  radical  (NCN),  a  symmetric  three-atomic  linear 
diradical with a triplet electronic ground state, is known since the early 
1960s.  It  was  spectroscopically  detected  and  characterized  in  several 
laboratories at about the same time and served as a model example for a 
species  with  a  gas  phase  spectrum  showing  distinct  spin-orbit  in-
teractions  and  Renner-Teller  effects  [1–6].  Its  role  in  combustion 
chemistry  became  manifest  around  the  year  2000,  when  Moskaleva 
et  al.  [7,8]  obtained  theoretical  evidence  that  the  CH  + N2  reaction, 
which  was  shown  to  be  crucial  for  the  formation  of  prompt-NO  and 
hence was implemented in many detailed combustion models in terms of 
the so-called Fenimore mechanism long before [9–11], yields NCN + H 
rather than the formerly assumed products HCN + N. Albeit the original 
Fenimore pathway does not obey spin conservation (a doublet + singlet 
reaction should not directly yield singlet + quartet species as the main 
products) [9,12] and therefore the assumed rate constant values were 
unusually  high  for  such  a  spin-forbidden  process,  it  was  possible  to 
reproduce  experimentally  observed  prompt-NO  formation  trends  [10, 
13]. The new pathway with NCN + H products proposed by Moskaleva 

et al. [7,8] accounts for spin conservation (a doublet + singlet reaction 
can yield triplet + doublet species without overall spin-flip). In order to 
verify  the  role  of  the  NCN  radical  as  the  major  reaction  product,  to 
further  highlight  associated  alternative  reaction  pathways  resulting 
from  possible  bimolecular  reactions  of  NCN,  and  to  come  up  with  a 
consistent mechanistic description of prompt-NO formation, a consid-
erable  number  of  experimental  and  theoretical  studies  have  been 
devoted to the CH + N2 reaction and the kinetics and thermodynamics of 
NCN since then. The aim of the present work is to review and discuss 
these studies to provide a comprehensive picture of the current state of 
knowledge on the spectroscopy and thermodynamics of NCN, as well as 
on  the  kinetics  of  its  formation  and  consumption  reactions  with 
emphasis on combustion-relevant conditions. Moreover, the influence of 
kinetic and thermodynamic data of NCN on the modeling of prompt-NO 
formation will be examined. 

The overall kinetics of the CH + N2 reaction is complicated because 
this bimolecular step initiates a multi-channel/multi-well reaction sys-
tem  including  a  doublet-quartet  spin  conversion.  A  schematic  energy 
diagram illustrating the essential features based on data compiled from 
Refs. [7,14–19] is shown in Fig. 1. We will refer to and further discuss

the details of this key figure throughout the review at different places. 
Nowadays,  it  is  well  known  that  the  kinetic  behavior  of  such  a 
complex-forming bimolecular reaction is governed by the competition 
between  reactive  steps  and  collisional  energy  transfer  (see  e.g. 
Ref. [11]). As indicated above, in the case of CH + N2 the occurrence of a 
non-adiabatic transition between different spin states leads to additional 
complications. These so-called intersystem crossing (ISC) processes are 
known to be comparatively slow, and therefore reaction channels pro-
ceeding along such pathways are termed to be “spin-forbidden” [20]. 

For  an  adequate  treatment  of  this  reaction  system  at  combustion- 
relevant conditions, it is necessary to first consider the reaction CH +
N2 leading to NCN + H on the doublet surface or, via ISC, to HCN + N on 
the  quartet  surface.  But  then,  it  is  also  necessary  to  account  for  the 
consecutive bimolecular reactions NCN + H leading either back to CH +
N2, again on the doublet surface, or forward toward HCN + N on the 
quartet surface. 

Obviously, the specification of the spin states of the involved species 
is important – all the more as the NCN radical exhibits a low-lying first 
electronically excited singlet state (Section 2). At several points of this 
review, it will turn out to be important to make a clear distinction be-
tween the NCN triplet electronic ground state, termed  3NCN, and the 
first  electronically  excited  singlet  state,  termed  1NCN.  This  of  course 
holds true for the spectroscopic and thermodynamics properties but also 
for  the  reactivity  of  the  two species  proceeding  on  separate  potential 
energy surfaces (Section 5). In the literature, however, “NCN” typically 
refers  to  3NCN  and  reported  rate  constant  expressions  for  “NCN”  re-
actions  either correspond to an appropriate thermal average over the 
contributions of both spin states or, in the majority of cases, simply as-
sume  that  possible  1NCN  contributions  can  be  neglected.  In  the 
following, we will adopt the notation “NCN” for 3NCN or a (presumably) 
3NCN-dominated overall reaction. However, whenever essential for the 
respective discussion and in the rare cases where authors have distin-
guished between 1NCN and 3NCN reactivity, we will specify the corre-
sponding spin states to avoid erroneous attribution. The same holds true 
for other species such as 2CH, where we explicitly state the spin state 
only when necessary for understanding. 

Back to the basic characteristics of the reaction CH + N2 as outlined 
in  Fig.  1.  Under  conditions  where  collisional  stabilization  of  the  in-
termediates is negligible (or in steady-state), the overall reaction system 
can be expressed in terms of the following bimolecular reactions (with 
reversibility written explicitly only if relevant under typical combustion 
conditions, see below): 

CH + N2 ⇌ NCN + H(R1a/R-1a) 

CH + N2 → HCN + N(R1b) 
NCN + H → HCN + N(R2) 

It turns out that the subtle interplay between these three reactions 
has a most pronounced influence on the kinetics of prompt-NO forma-
tion,  and  we  will  dedicate  a  considerable  part  of  this  review  to  this 
problem.  Moreover,  we  will  introduce  the  technical  term  prompt-NO 
switch to highlight the crucial role of the branching between the major 
reaction channels of NCN + H, namely the reverse reaction (R-1a) and 
the forward reaction (R2), to properly describe the further fate of the 
NCN radical in combustion systems. Here, forward is meant in a sense 
that reaction (R2) essentially corresponds to the traditional Fenimore 
initiation step on the route to NO by an effective transformation of CH +
N2 to HCN + N. 

A first attempt to kinetically describe the CH + N2 reaction system on 
the basis of Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) theory dates back 
to 1983, when Berman and Lin [21] analyzed their experimental results 
obtained  in  a  slow-flow  reactor.  The  authors  were  able  to  model  the 
pressure dependence of the rate constant between 3.3 and 105 kPa at a 
temperature of 297 K and the temperature dependence between 297 and 
675 K at a pressure of 13.3 kPa. It was assumed that the reaction pro-
ceeds  via  a  long-lived  intermediate,  HCN2  (with  a  hypothetical 
open-chain  HCNN structure)  that is  stabilized in  the low-temperature 
experiments,  whereas  at  higher  temperatures,  above  1000  K,  the 
direct abstraction/metathesis reaction giving HCN + N dominates. The 
doublet-quartet spin transition was assumed to be fast due to multiple 
curve crossings possible in the long-lived complex. 

In 1996, Fulle and Hippler [22] performed similar experiments and 
used  an  empirical  Troe  fit  to  describe  the  experimentally  obtained 
temperature and pressure dependence of the rate constant for CH + N2 
in the ranges T = 200–715 K and p = 0.1–15 MPa, respectively. More-
over,  the  high-temperature  limiting  value  of  the  rate  constant  was 
estimated  with  the  simplified  statistical  adiabatic  channel  model. 
Similar to Berman and Lin [21] and later Moskaleva and Lin [23], the 
authors concluded that collisional stabilization of HCN2 is dominant at 
low temperatures whereas dissociation of this adduct becomes impor-
tant  at  higher  temperatures.  Similar  theoretical  analyses  were  per-
formed at about the same time by Rodgers and Smith [24] and Miller 
and Walch [25]. Note that two structures of HCN2  described earlier in 
the literature [26–29] were considered as an open-chain dative struc-
ture, H–C–N–N, and a structure containing a three-membered CN2 ring, 
H–CN2. 

The  electronic  non-adiabaticity  of  reaction  (R1b)  was  for  the  first 
time explicitly addressed in a theoretical work by Cui et al. [18] in 1999.

initiation reaction CH + N2  yielding NCN + H 
and the subsequent prompt-NO switch reaction

the  forward  HCN  + N  products  (prompt-NO 
switch).  Approximate  energies,  molecular 
structures,  and  reaction  paths  have  been

dotted curves indicate the formerly considered 
spin-forbidden  prompt-NO  initiation  pathway 
CH + N2  → HCN + N, where the approximate 
energy  of  the  ISC  region  that  connects  the 
doublet  and  quartet  potential  energy  surfaces 
was adopted from Refs. [18,19]. The different 
channels are discussed in Sections 6 and 7.

The authors, in a one-dimensional approach, used the distorted wave 
approximation  to  calculate  the  ISC  probability.  The  value  for  the 
spin-orbit  coupling  element  was  obtained  from  ab  initio  calculations, 
and the crossing seam of the potential energy surfaces was treated as a 
transition state. The predicted rate constant was found to be two orders 
of  magnitude  below  the  experimental  values.  Interestingly,  this 
disagreement was discussed in terms of the approximations introduced 
in the theoretical treatment rather than the possibility that additional, 
not yet considered reaction channels may dominate the overall reaction. 
Shortly afterwards, in a seminal theoretical work published in 2000, 
Moskaleva  and  Lin  [7]  showed  that  NCN  + H,  and  not  as  previously 
assumed HCN + N, are the major products of the CH + N2  reaction at 
temperatures relevant for prompt-NO formation (T > 1200 K). This re-
action, (R1a), proceeds on the  doublet surface observing spin conser-
vation and is faster than reaction (R1b) that leads to the spin-forbidden 
products HCN + N with the N atom in its quartet electronic ground state. 
This new spin-conserved pathway has been also confirmed on CASPT2 
level by Takayanagi [30]. On the basis of molecular data from quantum 
chemical calculations (mainly at G2M(RCC) level of theory), the overall 
rate  constant  of  reaction  (R1a)  was  calculated  by  Moskaleva  and  Lin 
with a multichannel variational RRKM approach. The values obtained 
were found to be consistent with available results from previous shock 
tube experiments (T > 2000 K). 

The  first  clear  experimental  evidence  for  NCN  being  the  major 
product of the CH + N2 reaction was provided in a shock tube study by 
Vasudevan et al. in 2007 [31]. They monitored CH and NCN by laser 
absorption  and  obtained  temperature-dependent  rate  constants  k1a(T) 
and relative branching fractions k1a/(k1a  + k1b), int the 2228-2905 K 
temperature  range.  Also  a  first  estimate  of  the  high-temperature  ab-
sorption  coefficient  of  NCN  could  be  provided.  The  reported 
temperature-dependent overall rate constants of reaction (R1a) are in 
good agreement with values determined earlier by Dean et al. [32] in 
similar shock tube experiments following perturbations of the CH pro-
files by added N2. 

A  theoretical study  with  multi-reference ab  initio  methods  for the 
electronic structure calculations and variable reaction coordinate (VRC) 
transition state theory (TST) for the calculation of the rate constants was 
published in 2008 by Harding et al. [15]. The authors discussed that the 
use  of  multi-reference  methods  was  critical  for  the  properties  of  two 
rate-limiting transitions states and hence lead to a better agreement of 
the calculated rate constants with high-temperature shock tube results 
than the earlier predictions from Ref. [7]. At high temperatures, above 
1940 K, the predicted rate constants are in very good agreement with the 
measured values from Ref. [31] and also support values at lower tem-
peratures near 1500 K used in a flame modeling study by El Bakali et al. 
[33]. 

In a further theoretical study from M.C. Lin’s group in 2013, Teng 
et  al.  [16]  published  a  rate  expression  corresponding  to  k1a  that  was 
obtained from master equation (ME) calculations with energy-specific 
rate  constants  from  variational  TST  and  RRKM  theory.  Stationary 
points  on  the  potential  energy  surface  were  calculated  at  the 
coupled-cluster  level  of  theory  extrapolated  to  the  complete  basis  set 
limit. In the context of Ref. [16], an error in the rate constant code used 
in Ref. [7] was revealed that lead to an underestimation of k1a in the said 
publication. 

In a recent theoretical work by Klippenstein et al. [17], the CHN2 
reaction network was reanalyzed with emphasis on possible collisional 
stabilization  effects.  To  model  the  pressure  dependence  of  the  rate 
constants,  a  rigorous  ME  approach  was  used  in  combination  with 
high-level  electronic structure methods for the  determination of ther-
mochemical  data  of  NCN.  It  followed  that  collisional  stabilization  of 
HNCN (see Fig. 1) is not necessarily negligible. For kinetic modeling, 
pressure-dependent rate constants for the range p = 0.001–10 MPa are 
tabulated in the Supplementary Material of Ref. [17] in PLOG format 
(see e.g. Ref. [34]). Listed are the extended Arrhenius parameters for the 
reactions (R1a) and (R2) as well as for the reactions: 

CH + N2 → HNCN(R1c) 
NCN + H → HNCN(R3) 
NCN + H → HNC + N(R4) 

The rate constants for the corresponding reverse reactions were ob-
tained via the equilibrium constants. In this way, the reaction network 
interconnecting the species CH + N2/H + NCN/HNCN/HCN + N/HNC 
+ N  was  described  with  a  mutually  consistent  kinetic  and  thermody-
namic data set. In a recent review [35] on nitrogen chemistry in com-
bustion,  these  data  were  incorporated  into  a  recommended  global 
mechanism.

A particular role in this context plays the enthalpy of formation of 
◦
(NCN). Because reaction (R1a) is endothermic and the H +
NCN, ΔfH
NCN  combination  reaction  is  barrierless,  ΔfH
(NCN)  critically  de-
termines  the  kinetic  data  of  the  reversible  reaction  pair  (R1a)/(R-1a) 
and, as a consequence, strongly influences the branching ratios between 
reaction (R-1a) and other NCN-consuming reactions that may irrevers-
ibly remove NCN from the system. This competition has a large effect on 
the overall kinetics of prompt-NO formation. The reliable determination 
of ΔfH
(NCN) turned out to be not a straightforward task, and the actual 
value was the subject of a long-standing debate, which has been resolved 
only in recent years (see e.g. Refs. [15,17,36,37]).

Before  actual  measurements  of  NCN  in  flames  could  be  accom-
plished, a number of challenges had to be met. First, it was necessary to 
characterize spectroscopic properties of NCN at high temperatures, in 
particular  absorption  cross-sections  to  enable  absolute  concentration 
measurements.  Furthermore,  it  was  necessary  to  develop  techniques 
that were sufficiently sensitive to reliably detect the expected low con-
centrations  of  NCN  but  also  sufficiently  selective  to  monitor  NCN  in 
presence of interfering species such as NH. The first convincing experi-
mental evidence for the occurrence of NCN in flames was provided by 
Smith in 2003 [38]. On the basis of an earlier work [39], the author was 
able to determine the profiles of NCN concentration (in relative values) 
as  function  of  the  height  above  the  burner  (HAB)  in  low-pressure 
CH4/O2/N2  and  CH4/N2O/N2  flames  by  laser-induced  fluorescence

(LIF), adopting the 
By comparing the measured NCN profiles with CH profiles from Berg 
et al. [40] in a rich CH4/O2/N2 flame, Smith was also able to show that 
NCN is likely to be produced in the CH + N2  reaction and indeed rep-
resents a critical intermediate in prompt-NO formation. Subsequently, 
this approach via LIF was further developed and extended to different 
types of flames [41–46]. The quantification in absolute mole fractions of 
NCN required the use of cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS), a highly 
sensitive absorption technique. It was first implemented to measure the 
absolute mole fraction of NCN in a low-pressure flame by Lamoureux 
et al. [42]. 

The analysis of these increasingly detailed measurements, however, 
required,  besides  high-temperature  spectroscopic  data,  in  particular 
adequately parameterized chemical mechanisms. Even though in some 
earlier  works  mechanisms  containing  a  number  of  NCN  reactions 
already  had  been  used ([47],  for  a  review see [48]),  a  systematic in-
clusion of NCN reactions in kinetic combustion mechanisms started only 
around the year 2005 ([33,44,49–52], for a review see [35]). Soon after, 
it  became  obvious 
reliable 
high-temperature thermodynamic and kinetic data would be required. 
The rather high uncertainty or even the lack of these data has stimulated 
a considerable number of experimental and theoretical studies on NCN 
elementary chemical steps in subsequent years.

It the present work, we review and discuss the most crucial points 
within this ongoing story of NCN and its role in combustion. In struc-
turing this article, we diverge, however, from the historical outline just 
given and choose a more deductive way. We commence with molecular 
and spectroscopic properties of NCN and proceed via thermodynamic 
and kinetic data of NCN elementary reactions toward important global- 
kinetic modeling aspects at flame conditions. 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience87(2021)1009403N. Lamoureux et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            

To  begin  with,  Section  2  deals  with  fundamental  spectroscopic 
properties  of  NCN.  In  particular,  high-temperature  absorption  and 
fluorescence  spectra  will  be  discussed  with  emphasis  on  the  determi-
nation  of  absorption  cross  sections  for  quantitative  NCN  detection. 
Based on the spectroscopic data, the literature values for the heat ca-
pacity and the enthalpy of formation of NCN are collected, compared, 
and  discussed  in  Section  3.  In  Section  4,  the  production  of  NCN  to 
perform  gas  phase  kinetic  experiments  is  elucidated,  and  cyanogen 
azide, NCN3, is identified and characterized as a suitable photolytic and 
thermolytic precursor. In this context, the problem of NCN spin states 
and  in  particular  the  molecular  mechanisms  of  their  interconversion 
become relevant. These problems are discussed in Section 5 before the 
current  state  of  the  kinetics  of  NCN  elementary  chemical  steps  is 
reviewed in detail in Section 6. In the subsequent two Sections 7 and 8, 
the spectroscopic, thermodynamic, and kinetic data are used to examine 
absolute  NCN  concentrations  as  well  as  mechanistic  aspects  of  NCN 
production and consumption in flames. 

Along these lines, in Section 7, the measurement and modeling of 
NCN  in  flames  are  reviewed  and  discussed.  Problems  with  absolute 
calibration of NCN concentrations are examined, and a combination of 
LIF with CRDS is proposed as one approach to circumvent these diffi-
culties.  The  results  of  these  measurements,  that  is  essentially  species 
concentration profiles as function of the HAB, are compared to simula-
tion results, and extensive sensitivity analyses are used to determine the 
significance of selected NCN reactions. On the basis of these analyses, 
the influence of the reaction system (R1a)-(R4) is then studied in more 
detail in Section 8. Particular emphasis is put on the subtle temperature- 
dependent  switch  between  the  NCN-consuming  reactions  (R-1a)  and 
(R2), proceeding on the doublet and quartet potential energy surfaces, 
respectively.  A  simple  two-parameter  description  of  this  switching 
behavior is proposed and optimized by simulating NCN, HCN, and NO 
profiles in a rich low-pressure CH4/O2/N2 flame. Then, the selected two 
parameters are used for simulating the species profiles obtained in five 
low-pressure flames and for the NO prediction in high-pressure flames. 
General conclusions are drawn and recommendations for the modeling 
of prompt-NO formation are given. 

Finally, in Section 9, some general conclusions are drawn. 
Before  concluding  this  introduction  section,  we  note  that  other 
prompt-NO initiation steps that will not be discussed in this review may 
also contribute to NCN formation to a minor extent. But reactions such 
as C + N2 [32,53], 1,3CH2 + N2 [54–56], C2 + N2 [57,58], and C2O + N2 
[49,59,60] appear to exhibit high activation barriers or result in low net 
fluxes  due  to  low  concentrations  of  the  relevant  intermediates  under 
most flame conditions [35]. Both reactions, C2O + N2 → NCN + CO and 
C + N2  (+M) → NCN (+M), have been discussed to feed into the NCN 
radical pool [35,44,49,59], but a detailed inspection of the related po-
tential energy surfaces showed that they cannot compete with the CH +
N2  reaction. On the one hand, ab initio calculations performed by Zhu 
et al. [60] on the C2O + N2 reaction gave activation barriers of 253 kJ 
–1 for the minor NCN formation pathways on the 
mol
singlet and triplet energy surface, respectively. These values are too high 
for these reactions to be of any importance under practical combustion 
conditions. Also the main reaction channel of the C2O + N2  reaction, 
yielding CN2 + CO, is too slow. On the other hand, the reaction C + N2 
(+M) → NCN (+M) is the reverse of the unimolecular decomposition of 
the NCN radical, which will be discussed in some detail in Section 6. But 
instead of yielding NCN radicals, the bimolecular product channel N +
CN  appears  to be  the  major reaction  path  at  high temperatures [53], 
whereas recombination to CN2 is likely to prevail only at low tempera-
tures [61,62]. Though some of these reactions might gain influence on 
prompt-NO  formation  under  special  conditions,  their  general  impor-
tance  is  probably  small,  and  we  do  not  discuss  them  in  more  detail 
within this review.

2.1. Electronic energy levels 

Quantitative detection of NCN radicals in flames and in kinetics ex-
periments  has  been  accomplished  in  the  UV  range  by  both  laser  ab-
sorption  and  laser-induced  fluorescence.  Fig.  2  illustrates  the  energy 
level  diagram  of  the  relevant  NCN  singlet  and  triplet  manifolds.  The 
molecule is linear in the lowest triplet and singlet states as well as in the 
indicated higher electronic states [2,63]. The term symbols of the lowest 
̃b 
electronic states are  ̃X 3Σ(cid:0)

states lie at (8146 ± 80) cm
ground state as was deduced from photoelectron spectra of the NCN
anion [64].

At room  temperature and for  spectroscopic purpose, NCN radicals 
are  often  generated  by  flash  photolysis  of  cyanogen  azide  (NCN3), 
yielding transient NCN in both its singlet and its triplet state [5]. The 
electronic  transitions  between  the  ground  state  ̃X  and  the  first  meta-
̃b are both dipole- and spin-forbidden [65]. Accord-
stable states ˜a and 
ingly, the consecutive occurrence of NCN in the ˜a and  ̃X  states in one 
experiment  has  to  be  attributed  to  ISC  during  NCN3  decomposition 
and/or in the generated NCN radical itself. Production schemes for NCN 
as well as the problem of singlet-triplet relaxation will be discussed in 
detail in Sections 4 and 5.2.

Travis  [2],  NCN  spectroscopy  had  received  relatively  little  attention 
and, in most cases, set a focus on the triplet state. An original absorption 
spectrum of NCN taken from the seminal work [2] is reprinted in Fig. 3. 
Herzberg  and  Travis  analyzed  rotational  transitions  in  the  three 
subbands of the (000) – (000) band and partially of the (010) – (010) 
band.  They  also  showed  the  existence  of  a  Renner-Teller  interaction, 
where  the  situation  is  complicated  by  a  non-negligible  spin-orbit 
coupling. A schematic vibrational energy diagram of NCN obtained from 
a more recent simulation by Lamoureux et al. [68] is shown in Fig. 4. 

The LIF excitation spectra of NCN at 300 K recorded by Smith et al. 
[39] allowed the identification of spin-orbit triplets. Beaton et al. [69, 
70] confirmed the assignments of the (000) – (000) and the (010) – (010) 
bands  in  the  near  UV  and  provided  a  more  detailed  analysis  of  the

effects in the excited states. The NCN band head was spectrally resolved

bandwidth of 1 cm

Additional lines around 317–320 nm corresponding to the (020) – (000) 
and (030) – (010) bands were also observed (see Supplementary Mate-
rial of Ref. [73] and Fig. 6).

The simulation of well resolved room temperature LIF spectra with 
the spectral simulation program PGOPHER [74] served as a critical test of 
the capability to reproduce the complex vibrational structure of the NCN 
radical. In an initial work from 2009 [42], the simulation was restricted 
to three vibrational features ((000) – (000) band and two components of 
the  (010)  –  (010)  band,  shown  in  bold  in  Fig.  4),  where  molecular 
spectroscopic parameters were adopted from Beaton et al. [69,70]. As 
explained  in  Ref.  [42],  a  few  minor  adjustments  of  the  originally  re-
ported  spectroscopic  constants  were  necessary  in  order  to  fit  the 
experimental spectra reported in Refs. [39,69,70]. Fig. 5 presents the 
comparison  of the  experimental LIF excitation  spectrum from Hetzler 
and Olzmann [73] with simulated spectra from the two different spec-
troscopic models published in 2009 [42] and 2013 [68]. For the 2013 
version,  many  additional  bands  such  as  the  (020)  –  (020)  transitions

tions are also indicated (short-dashed lines); note that all the levels shown were 
included in the simulated spectrum reported in Ref. [68]. 

between  325.7  and  325.9  nm  were  included  to  further  improve  the 
simulation of spectral features that are weak at room temperature but 
more intense at higher temperatures. 

Some  off-diagonal  excitation  transitions  (Δυ2  ∕= 0)  were  also 
observed by LIF at room temperature [39,73], for instance the transi-
tions of the (020) – (000) band near 317.1 and 319.7 nm as shown in 
Fig. 6. Good spectra were also obtained after exciting NCN along the Π1,

g (000) band with the LIF signal being collected along the Π1,

the weaker fluorescence intensity of the off-diagonal transitions, and the 
close vicinity of spectral signatures from numerous other species (CH, 
OH, NCO, etc., see Ref. [75]), NCN detection after exciting off-diagonal 
transitions is not recommended in flames.

tional  vibrational  hot  bands,  Σ(cid:0)
g (010)–Πu(010)  and  Δg(010)–Πu(010). 
Based on an excitation LIF spectrum obtained in a flame at T = 1660 K 
(Fig. 7), the spectroscopic dataset of NCN has been investigated in Refs. 
[42,68].  The  relative  line  intensities  were  found  unaffected  when 
varying the laser intensity within a factor of 4, hence the spectrum was 
recorded  in  a  near-linear  LIF  regime.  Accordingly,  the  experimental 
spectrum  can  be  used  for  testing  the  spectral  simulation,  both  with 
respect to line positions and intensities. As can be seen in the inset of 
Fig. 7, by considering the (000) – (000) and (010) – (010) vibrational 
bands  only,  the  simulated  spectrum  calculated  with  PGOPHER  already 
satisfactorily  fits  the  experimental  LIF  excitation  spectrum  at  high 
temperature around the most intense band head at λ = 329 nm. How-
ever,  the  simulated  spectrum  with  the  2009  data  (blue  trace)  fails  to 
reproduce the experimental LIF spectrum at wavelengths shorter than 
328.8 nm. Since the wavenumber of the bending vibration in the ground 
–1 
state  is  lower  than  those  of  the  stretching  vibrations  (~423  cm
–1, cf. Table 1), in particular the 
compared to ~1245 cm
(0υ20) – (0υ20) bands with υ2 up to 4 have to be included in the simu-
lation as well as some other stretching bands like (100) – (100), peaking 
at λ = 329.18 and 329.03 nm, and (001) – (001). Here, the spectroscopic

parameters were extracted from infrared [76] and laser magnetic reso-
nance spectra [77,78] of the ν3 and ν2 + ν3 bands. In fact, according to 
the vibrational population distribution shown in Fig. 4 of Ref. [68], the 
population at high temperature is spread over many more levels such as 
those  shown  in  Fig.  4.  Clearly,  the  simulation  of  these  additional 
vibrational  bands 
the  calculated 
high-temperature  spectrum  over  a  wide  range  of  wavelengths  as  be-
comes obvious from the red trace in Fig. 7. Note that some modifications 
in  the  calculation  of  the  different  electronic  transition  moments  (in 
particular the one of the band origin) were applied in the 2013 model as 
described  in Ref.  [68].  As  a  result,  the contribution  from the  (000) – 
(000) band compared to the (010) – (010) bands decreased (see inset of 
Fig. 7). Also note the improved fitting of the two small features around 
329.03 nm, which is due to the (100) – (100) band. The assignment of 
the transitions is detailed in Fig. 3 of Ref. [68] and in Fig. 8. 

Quantitative detection of NCN in flames and shock tube experiments 
focused on the characteristic spectral features centered at 329 nm. Fig. 8 
zooms into this spectral range and compares the experimental spectra 
around  the  band  origin  obtained  by  LIF  and  CRDS  in  a  low-pressure 
flame  at  1660  K  (described  in  more  detail  in  Section  7.1).  Simulated 
spectra calculated at T = 1660 K and T = 300 K are also shown. Inter-
estingly,  at  high  temperature,  the  characteristic  feature  of  the  cold 
spectra centered at λ = 329.11 nm, namely the

2.4. Determination of the absorption cross section of NCN 

Quantitative  detection  of  NCN  in  flames  and  kinetics  experiments 
has been almost exclusively performed for the triplet electronic ground 
state. Here, the knowledge of its (narrow-bandwidth) absorption cross 
section is crucial to relate absorbance to concentration. While the tem-
perature  and  pressure  dependence  of  absorption  cross  sections  are 
straightforward to calculate for isolated rovibrational transitions [79], 
their determination in case of overlapped transitions is much facilitated 
by the use of simulation codes such as PGOPHER  [74]. The capability of 
this simulation code to reproduce the extended LIF spectrum of NCN and 
to  assign  most  of  the  additional  bands,  as  was  demonstrated  in  the 
preceding section, gives confidence also to use it for the calculation of 
cross  sections  and  their  extrapolation  to  different  temperatures  and 
˜
A –  ̃X 
pressures. Along these lines, the absorption cross section of the 
band  of  triplet  NCN  was  calculated,  on  the  one  hand,  from  spectral 
simulations with the PGOPHER program [74] by Lamoureux et al. [42,68] 
and, on the other hand, experimentally determined in direct absorbance 
measurements of samples with known NCN concentrations by Friedrichs 
and coworkers [72,80]. 

2.4.1. Lifetime measurements 

The calculation of the cross section was based on the knowledge of 
the electronic transition moments and the vibronic partition functions as 
described in Ref [68]. The electronic transition moments can be directly 
calculated from the radiative lifetime. The inverse of the radiative life-
time,  or  the  total  radiative  decay  rate,  can  be  determined  from  the 
extrapolation  to  zero-pressure  in  a  Stern-Volmer  plot  where  the  fluo-
rescence decay rate is plotted as a function of pressure. This implicitly 
supposes that the lifetime is not biased by non-radiative processes, and 
the inverse of the lifetime is thus equal to the Einstein emission coeffi-
cient.  Smith  et  al.  [39]  measured  the  radiative  lifetime  of  the  most 
prominent  features  of  the  NCN  LIF  excitation  spectrum  with  a  nano-
second  laser.  The  radiative  lifetime  at  zero  pressure  was  found  to  be 
equal to 183 ± 6 ns (2σ) with 4 ns average deviation and 2 ns precision 
for various (000) – (000) and (010) – (010) bands. 

To  check  the  reliability  of  this  single  reported  key  value,  for  this 
review the zero-pressure fluorescence lifetime of NCN was re-assessed in 
a joint effort of the Kiel (G.F.) and Lille (N.L, P.D.) groups. In this study, 
triplet NCN radicals were produced from photolysis of NCN3 by using an

quantum numbers comprised between 25 and 60. At 300 K, this feature 
could  not  be  clearly  analyzed  by  Herzberg  and  Travis  [2]  due  the 
proximity  of  the  intense  band  head  of  the  (000)  –  (000)  transition. 
Moreover, because of the proximity of these two features (separated by 
0.03 nm only), the first measurements of NCN at high temperature were 
erroneously attributed to the (000) – (000) band [31,38,41]. Similarly, 
the  line  strength  (attributed  falsely  to  NCN  (000)  –  (000))  was  over-
estimated by a factor of 4 in Refs. [38,41]. Actually, NCN detection at 
high temperatures turns out to be very sensitive due to the appearance of 
this  dominant  hot  band.  This  was  clearly  worked  out  by  absorption 
measurements performed at temperatures of 298 K, 850 K, and 1600 K 
by Dammeier and Friedrichs [72] (see Figs. 1 and 3 in Ref. [72]). 

Another  important  aspect  that  needs  to  be  considered  for  flame 
detection  of  NCN  is  the  spectral  shape  of  the  dispersed  fluorescence 
spectrum emitted after NCN excitation. LIF excitation spectra are typi-
cally recorded by collecting the fluorescence photons within a certain 
spectral bandwidth determined by the experimental setup (interference 
filter  or  monochromator).  However,  the  reliability  of  the  measured 
relative intensities in an excitation spectrum critically depends on the 
collection  of  fluorescence  photons  over  a  sufficiently  broad  range  of 
wavelengths. Indeed, in case of NCN the spectral range of the emission 
depends on the excitation wavelength as is illustrated in the dispersed 
fluorescence  spectra  shown  in  Fig.  9.  Note  that  no  off-diagonal  fluo-
rescence bands (Δυi ∕= 0) were observed, in agreement with Smith et al. 
[39]. In this way, the measurement of the radiative lifetimes allows a 
straightforward  determination  of  the  Einstein  emission  coefficients. 
Moreover, from Fig. 9, it becomes obvious that the dispersed fluores-
cence spectrum is shifted toward shorter wavelengths for υ2  > 2 tran-
sitions. Fig. 9 also gives an impression on the bandwidth (around 6 nm) 
necessary to ensure collection of the entire dispersed fluorescence when

excimer laser operating at a wavelength of 193 nm as previously indi-
cated in Ref. [72] and further outlined in Section 4. Following a time 
delay of 800 ms to allow for relaxation of the initially formed 1NCN (see 
Section 4.2), the triplet NCN radicals were excited by a picosecond laser 
(cid:0) 1). The two collinear 
pulse at 329.1 nm (spectral bandwidth < 12 cm
laser beams propagated through a low-pressure cell with Ar as bath gas. 
The  time-resolved  fluorescence  decay  was  measured  with  a  photo-
multiplier tube (PMT) after passing a monochromator (Acton SP2300i, 
grating 1200g/mm) with a spectral bandwidth of 328 ± 3 nm. The signal 
was sampled by an oscilloscope with 12 bit vertical resolution (LeCroy 
HDO4000,  1  GHz).  The  fluorescence  signals  were  averaged  over  500 
laser shots, and at least four such measurements were performed at each 
pressure.  From  Stern-Volmer  plots  (see  Fig.  S1  of  the  Supplementary 
Material), values of 182.2 ns and 184.4 ns were obtained for the radi-
ative lifetime of NCN at two different mole fractions of the precursor 
NCN3.  The  relative  standard  deviations  of  the  fluorescence  lifetimes 
were below 1%. The resulting mean value is 183.3 ± 7 ns where the 
uncertainty corresponds to two standard deviations. It is in agreement 
with the value of 183 ± 6 ns previously reported by Smith et al. [39]. 
Note  that  their  investigation  has  been  performed  at  rather  different 
experimental  conditions  regarding  both  NCN  production  (micro-
wave-discharge  of  CF4  in  N2  vs.  laser  photolysis  of  NCN3)  and  pulse 
duration of the excitation laser (ns vs ps). Taking this into account, a 
value of 183 ± 7 ns can be considered reliable and is recommended. 

Using  this  value,  the  absorption  cross  section  was  calculated  with 
PGOPHER.  Note  that  the  program  calculates  the  partition  functions 
exclusively for electronic ground state levels included in the simulation 
(i.e. the levels shown in Fig. 4). Hence, the calculated absorption cross 
section  value  has  been  corrected  by  the  ratio  between  the  vibronic 
partition functions of all the levels explicitly described in the simulation 
and the total partition functions summed over all the vibronic levels. As 
expected,  the  obtained  Doppler-limited  absorption  cross  section  was 
found to have a negative temperature dependence (red line in Fig. 10), 
which  can  be  approximated  over  the  temperature  range  from  750  to 
2500 K with an average uncertainty of ±22%:

The error estimate takes into account the ±3.8% uncertainty of the 
radiative  lifetime  and  ±20%  coming  from  the  overall  simulation, 
including the calculation of the vibronic partition function [68].

2.4.2. Direct absorption measurements 

simulations:  Assuming  a 

Dammeier and Friedrichs [72] reported a direct measurement of the 
high-temperature absorption cross section of NCN in shock tube exper-
iments on NCN3. By assuming quantitative formation of NCN from NCN3 
(see  Section  4.2),  the  absorption  cross  section  of  triplet  NCN  was 
determined  from  the  measured  absorption  signals  observed  after 
shock-heating of highly diluted NCN3/Ar mixtures containing < 15 ppm 
of  NCN3.  Time-resolved  measurements  were  performed  by  using  dif-
ference  amplification  laser  absorption  spectroscopy  with  a  tunable 
narrow-bandwidth (< 10 MHz), frequency-doubled UV ring-dye laser at 
wavelengths around λ = 329.1 nm (overall wavelength uncertainty Δλ 
–4  nm). The temperature and pressure range of the experi-
= ± 1.6×10
ments  was  750–2250  K  and  20–250  kPa,  respectively.  No  significant 
pressure dependence of the absorption cross section was observed. This 
is  consistent  with  PGOPHER 
typical 
pressure-broadening coefficient of 0.6 GHz (T = 1600 K, p = 100 kPa) 
for a three-atomic species [81] results in a merely 6% lower peak ab-
sorption  cross  section  compared  to  a  Doppler-limited  case  when 
changing  the  pressure  from  0.05  to  0.1  MPa.  The  reported 
Doppler-limited absorption cross section data are shown in Fig. 10 and 
are a factor of about 2.5 lower than those determined by Lamoureux and 
coworkers [68] from the radiative lifetime measurements and spectral 
simulations  as  explained  in  the  preceding  Section.  This  unexpectedly 
large discrepancy has been not resolved until very recently. Faßheber 
et al. [80] re-investigated the absorption cross section using two inde-
pendent detection systems and performed a detailed analysis of poten-
tial  error  sources  including  a  careful  analysis  of  the  stability  and 
chemical composition of the reactant gas mixtures. It turned out that the 
used  gas  mixtures  contained  a  significant  amount  of  previously  un-
identified molecular nitrogen (see also Section 4.1). Moreover, decom-
position and wall losses of NCN3 in the storage flasks and the gas supply 
lines  showed  that  a  correction by  at  least a  factor  of  1.5  needs  to  be 
applied to the earlier data from Dammeier and Friedrichs (indicated by 
the  green  arrow  in  Fig.  10).  The  newly  measured  data  points  from 
Faßheber et al. [80] are included in Fig. 10 as open circles. The absolute 
values and temperature dependence are in agreement with the calcu-
lations of Lamoureux et al. [68] within error limits. Finally, the result of 
the shock tube study by Vasudevan et al. [31] as detailed in Section 6.1.1 
are included in Fig. 10 as a blue line. Within the reported uncertainty of 
a factor of two, which is mostly related to the modeled CH concentration 
profiles  of  the  shock-heated  ethane/He/N2  gas  mixture  in  Ref.  [31], 
these data are in reasonable agreement with the data from Refs. [68] and 
[80] as well. 

In contrast to 3NCN, quantitative detection of 1NCN has only been 
reported so far in one kinetic study by Dammeier et al. [82]. Here, 1NCN 
has been detected as a product of the thermal decomposition of NCN3 
behind shock waves by using narrow-bandwidth laser absorption spec-
troscopy. Part of the band head of the ̃c1Πu(000) ← ̃a1Δg(000) transition 
has been measured at a temperature of about 740 K and a pressure of 39 
kPa,  revealing  a  structureless  spectral  feature  near  332.8  nm.  By 
simultaneous fits of the kinetic profiles for 3NCN and 1NCN (see Fig. 12 
in  Section  4.1), 
the  mainly 
Doppler-limited  absorption  cross  section  has  been  estimated  for  the 
temperature range 618 K < T < 1231 K. It can be expressed in the form 
–19  × T/K 
σ(1NCN, 332.8290 nm)(T)/cm2  = 1.66 × 10
with an uncertainty of ±50%. It turns out that the absolute values are 
similar to those for 3NCN. Note, however, that the result depends on the 
assumed  mechanistic  model  for  1NCN  formation  and  relaxation  (see 
Section  5.2)  and  does  not  yet  account  for  the  potential  extra  un-
certainties related to the assumed initial NCN3 concentration mentioned 
above.

thermochemistry  of  NCN  is  crucial  because  it  directly  affects  the 
branching ratio of the reaction NCN +H, and subsequently the prompt- 
NO switch. 

3.1. Vibrational energy levels and rotational constant 

From the simulated spectrum, it is also possible to derive the vibra-
tional  wavenumbers  and  rotational  constant  of  the  NCN  free  radical. 
These  quantities  are  closely  related,  via  the  corresponding  partition 
functions,  to  thermodynamic  data  like  heat  capacities,  standard  en-
tropies,  and  thermal  corrections  for  energies  (see  e.g.  Refs.  [83,84]). 
Experimental results reported in the literature are presented in Table 1. 
Most of these values were obtained from spectroscopic band analyses 
and  represent  fundamental  vibrational  wavenumbers.  The  rotational 
constant B0 is the value for the ground vibrational state of NCN. 

Nowadays, molecular properties can also be predicted by quantum 
chemical methods, often with sufficient accuracy [85]. Selected results 
of  such  calculations  for  NCN  vibrational  wavenumbers  and  the  rota-
tional  constant  are  listed  in  Table  2.  Here,  in  contrast  to  the  experi-
mental  results  (Table  1),  mostly  harmonic  vibrational  wavenumbers 
have  been  published.  Fundamental  vibrational  wavenumbers  can  be 
calculated  from  perturbation  theory  (see  e.g.  Ref.  [86])  but  are  less 
frequently  reported;  they  are  marked  in  Table  2.  The  rotational  con-
stants Be  in Table 2 are those calculated from equilibrium geometries. 
For the relation between Be and B0 see e.g. Refs. [83,84,87]. 

It  turns  out  that  for  NCN  the  differences  between  harmonic  and 
fundamental  wavenumbers  are  small,  resulting  in  differences  of  the 
corresponding vibrational zero-point energies on the order of merely a 
–1  [37]. A peculiarity of NCN noted in Ref. [17] 
few hundredth kJ mol
appears  to  be  the  sensitivity  of  the  calculated  wavenumber  of  the 
asymmetric stretching vibration (ω3 in Table 2) to spin restriction at the 
Hartree-Fock and/or the CCSD(T) level of theory. Here, deviations by 
–1  compared  to  the  experimental  value  were  ob-
more  than  1000  cm
tained  in  some  cases,  leading  to  errors  in  the  predicted  vibrational 
–1. The problem, which also con-
zero-point energy of up to 12 kJ mol
cerns the CBS limit of the CCSD(T) energy, can be overcome by using 
unrestricted wave functions. Only values unbiased by this artifact are 
collected  in  Table  2;  for  details  see  Ref.  [17].  An  overview  of  NCN 
vibrational  energy  levels  of  the  electronic  ground  state  and  several 
electronically excited states that were published prior to the year 2000 is 
given in Ref. [93].

the gas constant (see e.g. Refs. [83,84]). The partition function in turn 
can be calculated at different levels of approximation (see e.g. Refs. [83, 
84]).  For  small  molecules  without  torsional  degrees  of  freedom  like 
NCN, a rigid rotor harmonic oscillator (RRHO) approach is often suffi-
ciently accurate for typical combustion conditions. In the following, we 
compare heat capacities calculated in RRHO approximation on the basis 
of  molecular  data  from  different  sources.  The  calculations  were  per-
formed with the program code PAC99 from McBride and Gordon [94]; 
standard state is the ideal gas at p = 0.1 MPa. The results of these cal-
culations  are  represented  in  the  widely  used  seven-coefficient  NASA

polynomials (see e.g. Refs. [95,96]): Cp

We note that coefficients of the NASA polynomials are usually given/ 
stored in machine-readable format [95,97], where the first seven entries 
are the coefficients a1 through a7 for T = 1000–6000 K and the second 
seven entries the same for T = 200–1000 K (see Table S1 of the Sup-
plementary  Material).  Note  that  also  a  less  common  nine-coefficient 
format exists [97,98] (see Table S2). 

A comparison of heat capacities as a function of temperature from 
different sources is made in Fig. 11. These sources/models are denoted 
by  capital  letters  A  to  H  and  are  briefly  characterized  in  the  inset  of 
Fig. 11; more details are given in Tables S1 to S3 of the Supplementary 
Material.  From  Fig.  11  it  is  obvious  that  the  values  from  almost  all 
sources fall into a very narrow range. Relative deviations are plotted in 
Fig. S2 of the Supplementary Material. For models A to C and E to G, 
these deviations are well below 1% over the entire temperature range 
200 K < T < 6000 K. 

The very similar data sets D and H show larger deviations from the 
other models. We note that the data points from H and the curve from D 
stem  from  the  same  publication  [35]  and  were  calculated  probably 
relying on the same molecular data set, which is, however, not readily 
available. Our re-calculation with the most recent available molecular 
data  set  from  one  of  the  authors  (Klippenstein  et  al.  [92])  gave  heat 
capacities (curves E and F) in very good agreement with the data from A, 
B, C, and G. We were not able, however, to reproduce the heat capacities 
from  D  and  H.  So,  the  reason  for  the  deviation  remains  unclear,  and 
there may be assumptions/approximations not documented along with 
the  published  data  of  D  and  H  in  Refs.  [17,35].  Note  that  such  an

nificant uncertainties, for example about 3 kJ mol
formation  at  1500  K.  Such  deviations  may  result  in  subsequent  un-
certainties for the NCN and NO predictions in flames. Goos et al. [36] 
reported a decrease of the NCN peak mole fraction by a factor 0.75 with 
(cid:0) 1, see Figs. 1 and 
the increase of the enthalpy of formation by 12 kJ mol

In view of the rather small differences in the heat capacities calcu-
lated with the seven-coefficients NASA polynomials A [36] and C [37], 
we recommend these data sets for the calculation of thermal corrections 
to enthalpies and energies. With the data from Ref. [37], one obtains an

3.3. Enthalpy of formation 

The enthalpy of formation of a species is a most influential quantity 
not only for thermodynamic but also for kinetic considerations because 
it is intrinsically connected with the energies of activation of the forward 
and backward step of a reversible reaction (see e.g. Ref. [99]). Within a 
very complex reaction network like hydrocarbon combustion, compli-
cated  dependences  of  reaction  pathways  from  energetic  quantities  of 
participating species can occur. Therefore, any adequate description and 
analysis  of  the  role  of  NCN  in  the  formation  of  prompt-NO  requires 
reliable values for the enthalpy of formation, ΔfH
(NCN), as a function 
of temperature. 

◦

◦

◦

Since NCN is a reactive radical species, experimental determinations 
of  ΔfH
(NCN)  are  difficult  and  so  far  rather  indirect  and  scarce. 
Accordingly, most of the data on ΔfH
(NCN) published so far were ob-
tained  from  quantum  chemical  calculations  for  the  triplet  species. 
(3NCN)  values  obtained  with  different 
Extensive  discussions  of  ΔfH
experimentally-based and theoretical methods, including thermochem-

approaches are listed. With exception of the ATcT values collected at the 
end of the table, the entries are grossly in chronological order. Consid-

4. NCN production for kinetics experiments 

Different experimental approaches have been used to produce NCN 
as a reactant for kinetics experiments. To the best of our knowledge, the 
first experimental determination of rate constants for NCN reactions was 
reported  by  Baren  and  Hershberger  in  2002  [107].  Based  on  earlier 
spectroscopic studies [2], these workers used laser flash photolysis of 
diazomethane/dicyan  (CH2N2/C2N2)  mixtures  at  wavelengths  of  193 
nm or 248  nm to produce NCN radicals, presumably  via the reaction 
1CH2  + C2N2  →  NCN + C2H2. Later on, in a number of experimental 
studies at temperatures below ca. 500 K, laser photolysis of cyanogen 
azide (NCN3) at wavelengths of 248 nm or 193 nm was employed as 
NCN radical source [82,102,108–110]. 

A first high-temperature rate constant determination of the reaction 
NCN + H has been reported in 2007 by Vasudevan et al. [31]. These 
in 
authors  analyzed  NCN  concentration-time  profiles  observed 
shock-heated ethane/nitrogen/helium/argon  gas mixtures.  The use of 
NCN3  as a direct thermal precursor of NCN in high-temperature shock 
tube studies has been described since about the year 2010 by the groups 
of Friedrichs [72,80,82,102,111–114] and Olzmann [115,116]. 

Since  the  photolysis  or  thermal  decomposition  of  NCN3  currently 
appears to be the most widely used source of NCN in kinetics experi-
ments, we outline in the following important aspects of this approach, 
touching both practical and more fundamental questions. 

4.1. NCN3  as a precursor of NCN 

The pyrolysis of gaseous cyanogen azide, NCN3, has been first dis-
cussed  as  an  efficient  NCN  source  in  the  work  of  Marsh  and  Hermes 
[117]. Shortly after, in a flash photolysis study of gaseous NCN3, Kroto 
[5] observed strong absorption features that he assigned to NCN: 1NCN 
˜
A Πu←  ̃X 3Σ(cid:0)
(̃c  1Πu  ← ̃a 1Δg) and 3NCN (
g , where the singlet NCN was 
mentioned  to  be  likely  formed  first.  NCN3  is  a  highly  explosive  and 
presumably  very  toxic  substance,  hence  great  care  should  be  taken 
during synthesis and handling of this compound. Marsh [118] describes 
the pure azide “as a colorless oil which detonates with great violence 
when subject to mild mechanical, thermal, or electrical shock”, there-
fore  gaseous  NCN3  should  never  be  condensed.  Typically,  NCN3  is 
handled as a solution in aprotic solvents [119] or kept in the gas phase at 
partial  pressures  of  a  few  hPa,  preferentially  diluted  in  inert  gases. 
Nevertheless,  the  authors  of  this  paper  experienced  occasional  defla-
grations during NCN3  synthesis of gaseous samples. Purification steps 
such as freeze-pump cycles are not possible. Instead, NCN3  is directly 
synthesized  in  high  purity  by  using  variants  [72,116]  of  a  method 
described by Milligan et al. [88]. In this approach, evaporated gaseous 
cyanogen bromide, BrCN, quantitatively reacts with excess solid sodium 
azide,  NaN3,  at  room  temperature  according  to  the  reaction  NaN3  +
BrCN → NCN3 + NaBr. The total reaction time, typically many hours, is 
chosen long enough to make sure a complete conversion of BrCN but 
short enough to minimize the slow decomposition of the NCN3 product. 
Decomposition of pure and diluted NCN3 gas mixtures has been reported 
to be on the order of 5–15% per day and yields a solid substance at the 
walls  of  the  reaction  flask  [72,80].  Purity  of  the  freshly  synthesized 
products  has  been  analyzed  by  mass  spectrometry  and  FTIR

spectroscopy. The reported main impurity is non-reacted BrCN, which is 
typically  present  on  the  percent  mole  fraction  level  [72,80,120].  At 
longer  storage  or  reaction  times,  significant  amounts  of  cyanogen, 
(CN)2, are discernible in the FTIR spectra; freshly synthesized gas mix-
tures  contained about 1% [80].  Stored mixtures also  show increasing 
+
mass  peaks  at  m/z  = 54  (CN3,  e.g.  NC-NN
)  and  80  (C2N4,  e.g. 
NC-NN-CN
)  that  have  been  tentatively  assigned  to  fragments  of  the 
NCN3  dimerization/polymerization  product  or  the  NCN  dimer  azodi-
carbonitrile  (NCN=NCN)  [80,121].  Note  that  the  latter  has  been 
described as the main product of NCN3 pyrolysis at 200
C as well [117]. 
Very recently, molecular nitrogen (but not O2, as may be expected in 
case of leaks) has been identified as another significant and difficult to 
quantify  impurity.  Not  unexpected,  it  is  presumably  formed  as  direct 
product of NCN3 decomposition and polymerization. Analyzed by means 
of  quantitative  gas  chromatography,  freshly  prepared  NCN3  mixtures 
contained 15–25% N2 after a synthesis time of 10 hours [80]. 

◦

Despite these difficulties in using NCN3  as a quantitative source of 
NCN radicals, NCN3  can be still considered first choice for reaction ki-
netics studies. NCN3 storage mixtures should be used for a maximum of a 
few days to avoid interfering impurity-related chemistry. Impurities of 
BrCN, however, due to its high thermal stability, are less problematic in 
shock  tube  studies  where  even  addition  of  up  to  50%  BrCN  did  not 
change the observed NCN concentration-time profiles [72]. Moreover, 
studies of bimolecular reactions NCN + X have been performed under 
pseudo-first order conditions with X acting as the excess component in 
most cases. Under such conditions, accurate knowledge of the absolute 
NCN3 and with it NCN concentration is less important for a reliable rate 
constant determination. 

4.2. NCN formation in the pyrolysis and UV photolysis of NCN3 

Both thermal decomposition and UV photolysis of cyanogen azide is 
known to yield NCN in its first electronically excited singlet state, ̃a1Δg 
(in short 1NCN) instead of its ground state, ̃X 3Σ(cid:0)

g  (in short 3NCN). 

g ) was found to exhibit a small additional barrier along 

The ground state potential energy surface of NCN3 (1A’, S0) has been 
first calculated by Benard et al. [122] at density functional B3LYP level 
of  theory.  Endothermic  dissociation  to  the  spin-correlated  products 
1NCN + N2(̃X1Σ+
the dissociation coordinate. Starting from the 3NCN + N2(̃X1Σ+
g ) prod-
ucts, the repulsive 3A" (T1) surface was also constructed yielding a level 
crossing of the S0  and T1  states near the singlet surface maximum. In 
such a case, it is expected that ISC probabilities are small compared to 
the  specific  dissociation rate constants  and  therefore  1NCN should be 
observed as the primary, if not exclusive thermal dissociation product. 
This qualitative picture has been broadly confirmed by subsequent 
theoretical studies of Ci et al. [123] and Pfeifle et al. [124]. The latter 
authors performed high-level CASPT2 and MRCI calculations and also 
located the minimum of the crossing seam between S0 and T1 at 105.4 kJ 
–1, which was found to be slightly below the adiabatic dissociation 
mol
–1. In order to quantify the possible direct for-
barrier of 107.5 kJ mol
mation  of  3NCN,  a  non-adiabatic  statistical  theory  calculation  with 
weak-coupling probabilities has been carried out by Pfeifle et al. [124]. 
It confirmed that the spin-allowed adiabatic formation of 1NCN domi-
nates, but the spin-forbidden 3NCN formation may contribute to a few 
percent. 

Predominant 1NCN formation in thermal decomposition of NCN3 has 
been confirmed experimentally as well. Fig. 12 shows singlet and triplet 
NCN profiles observed by Dammeier et al. [82] in shock-heated diluted 
mixtures  of  NCN3  in  argon.  Here,  both  1NCN  and  3NCN  have  been 
detected by time-resolved narrow-bandwidth absorption in successive 
experiments.  Fast  formation  of  1NCN  was  observed,  which  has  been 
attributed  to  the  unimolecular  decomposition  of  the  NCN3  precursor, 
whereas the delayed 3NCN formation shows no indication for a direct 
3NCN  photodissociation  pathway  but,  as  it  will  be  discussed  in  more

detail in Section 5.2, is most consistent with a subsequent singlet-triplet 
relaxation process. 

The UV photolysis of NCN3 served as a precursor for many spectro-
scopic studies [2,4,5,63,67,88,125,126]. The absorption peak at 220 nm 
corresponds to S1 ← S0 excitation [123]. Selective population of the S1 
state is possible by using the excimer laser wavelength λ = 248 nm [73], 
whereas at λ = 193 nm both the S1 and S2 states need to be considered. 
Calculated electronic transition dipole moments for the S1 ← S0 and S2 ← 
S0 transition are 0.24 D and 2.44 D, respectively [124]. 

Depending  on  the  photolysis  wavelength,  the  reported  primary 
photodissociation  products  are  1NCN  as  the  dominant  species  under 
most experimental conditions and CN in case of short photolysis wave-
lengths of λ ≤ 193 nm [125,126]. Another direct dissociation pathway 
forming 3NCN, as mentioned in Refs. [82,125] for λ ≤ 193nm, points to a 
potential role of fast ISC processes in photo-excited NCN3. Alternatively, 
the spin-allowed decomposition of NCN3 yielding excited N2 according 
to NCN3 → 3NCN(3Σ(cid:0)
g ) + N2(3Σ) has been suggested [125,126]. At room 
temperature and pressures of a few hPa, however,  3NCN formation is 
markedly delayed by more than 100 μs, showing that subsequent pro-
cesses such as collision-induced ISC and collisional cooling are signifi-
cant for the overall relaxation process (see also Section 5.2). Theoretical 
insight into the photodissociation mechanism is provided by the already 
mentioned high-level computational studies of Ci et al. [123] and Pfeifle 
et  al.  [124].  Consistent  with  the  experimental  findings,  following 
photo-excitation from the S0  to the S1  or S2  states of NCN3, dominant 
formation of 1NCN takes place on repulsive potential energy surfaces. As 
outlined in the work of Pfeifle et al. [124], radiationless transitions of S1 
and  S2  to  low-lying  triplet  states  or  S0  may  lead  to  (a  minor)  direct 
formation of  3NCN as  well, both in  its triplet  ground state  ̃X3Σ(cid:0)
g  (via 
˜
A3Π u  state (via 
conceivable pathways from S1 and S2) and in its excited 
pathways from S2). 

5. The role of the spin state of NCN 

As already mentioned in Section 2 (see Fig. 2), the electronic ground 
g  state. The next higher and lowest singlet state is a 
–1 above the ground state, hence cor-
–1 

state of NCN is a 3Σ(cid:0)
1Δg state located (8146 ± 80) cm
responding to a singlet-triplet splitting of ΔSTH
[64]. As the reactivity of singlet and triplet states can be very different, 
the question for possible mechanistic consequences in combustion sys-
tems arises as well as the question for the mechanism and kinetics of the 
ISC  process.  This  section  reviews  the  current  state  of  knowledge 
regarding these topics.

5.1. The potential role of 1NCN in thermal systems 

In  thermal  systems,  the  relative  population  of  the  singlet  state  is 
lower  than  1%  up  to  temperatures  of  2650  K.  Thus,  1NCN  chemistry 
would not be expected to play an important role in prompt-NO forma-
tion and has not been considered in flame models so far. However, for 
those NCN reactions that are comparatively slow, for example reactions 
with closed-shell species, 1NCN chemistry might become significant as is 
shown by the following example: Assuming a fast thermal equilibration 
3NCN  ⇌  1NCN  with  an  equilibrium  constant  Keq  calculated  from  the 
NASA polynomials as reported in this work (see Tables S1 and S4 of the 
Supplementary  Material),  the  1NCN-related  fraction  ϕsinglet  of  the 
overall NCN loss caused by a pair of 1NCN + X and 3NCN + X reactions, 

ϕsinglet =

d([1NCN])
d([NCN]total)

=

ksinglet [1NCN]
ksinglet[1NCN] + ktriplet [3NCN]

can be rearranged to an expression for the temperature-dependent ratio 
of the singlet and triplet reaction rate constants as a function of ϕsinglet:

Keq 

Fig.  13  plots  the  rate  constant  ratio  corresponding  to  a  fraction 
ϕsinglet  = 1%  (or  10%,  50%,  90%)  as  a  function  of  temperature.  For 
example, supposing that ksinglet/ktriplet = 1000, already at a temperature 
of 1135 K (or 1485 K, 2070 K, 3420 K), 1% (10%, 50%, 90%) of the 
overall NCN loss would be due to the 1NCN reaction. Clearly, separate 
treatment of 1NCN and 3NCN chemistry may be necessary at such tem-
peratures, in particular in case of different products for the singlet and 
triplet  reaction.  Note,  however,  that  many  bimolecular  reactions  of 
3NCN with atoms and radical species exhibit rate constant values on the 
(cid:0) 1. In those cases, separate inclusion of 
order of 1013 – 1014 cm3 mol
1NCN chemistry will not change the overall picture very much because 
the 1NCN reaction can be only about a factor of 10 faster at maximum 
(otherwise the rate constant would exceed the collision number). 

(cid:0) 1 s

In  general,  excited  singlet  radical  chemistry  is  fundamentally 
different from ground state triplet chemistry. For example, ground state 
3CH2 (̃X3B1) reacts with hydrocarbons non-stereospecific and activation- 
controlled under H atom abstraction, whereas excited 1CH2  (˜a1A1) in-
serts  in  single  bonds  and  undergoes  stereospecific  addition  to  double 
bonds with no or very low energy barriers and rate coefficients close to 
collision number [127–129]. Similarly, 1NH (a1Δ) inserts into CH bonds, 
whereas  3NH  (X3Σ(cid:0)
)  abstracts  hydrogen  from  hydrocarbons,  H2,  and

the  rate  constants  of  two  corresponding  singlet  and  triplet  NCN  reactions,

90% to the overall NCN loss. 

H2O [130,131]. So far, examples for the explicit consideration of 1NCN 
chemistry  in  reaction  kinetics  studies,  next  to  the  singlet-triplet 
quenching discussed below, are scarce. 

In their shock tube study on the reaction NCN + O2, Faßheber and 
Friedrichs  [114]  postulated  the  fast  formation  of  a  3NCN-OO  species 
from the reaction 1NCN + O2 (3Σ(cid:0)
g ). The formation of 3NCN-OO served 
as  a  temporary  sink  for  NCN  that  was  needed  to  explain  the  experi-
mentally observed delayed formation of 3NCN in shock-heated mixtures 
of NCN3/O2/Ar. The delayed  3NCN formation has been modeled by a 
subsequent, independent decomposition step 1NCNOO* →  3NCN + O2 
(3Σ(cid:0)
g ),  hence  implicitly  assuming  a  rate-limiting  ISC  step  forming 
1NCNOO*  in-between.  According  to  their  data,  the  1NCN  + O2  → 
3NCN-OO reaction proceeds with a rate constant >600 times higher than 
that of the 3NCN + O2  reaction (calculated for T =1500 K and p = 25 
kPa).  Consequently,  the  singlet  reaction  may  be  competitive  under 
combustion conditions albeit the fate of the postulated 3NCN-OO species 
remains unclear. 

More recently, Faßheber et al. [80] performed a quantum chemical 
kinetic study on the products of the reaction 1,3NCN + H2 (see Section 
6.2.3). Similar to the trends observed for 1,3CH2  and 1,3NH, the 3NCN 
reaction yields the H abstraction product HNCN + H whereas the 1NCN 
was found to form the N-centered insertion product NCNH2 (followed by 
isomerization to HNCNH and decomposition to HNCN + H). In contrast 
to the 1NH and 1CH2 reactions that proceed without energy barrier and 
–1 has 
close to the collision limit, a sizeable entrance barrier of 74 kJ mol
been found for the 1NCN reaction (in comparison with a barrier of 115 
–1 for the corresponding 3NCN reaction). This reaction barrier has 
kJ mol
been attributed to the necessary reorganization of the HOMO electron 
density during the bond insertion that is initially uniformly distributed 
over the two N atom sites in 1NCN [80]. Nevertheless, the rate constant 
of the singlet reaction was found to be 600 times larger than for 3NCN at 
T = 1000 K  and taking into account the singlet reaction significantly 
improved  the  agreement  between  experimental  shock  tube  data  and 
theoretical predictions. For implementing the reaction NCN + H2  into 
flame  models,  they  recommended  either  to  consider  1NCN  and  3NCN 
chemistry separately or to use an effective rate constant expression for 
NCN,  treating  NCN  as  a  sum  species  by  properly  weighting  over  the 
singlet and triplet contributions. This is sufficiently accurate as the main 
reaction products in case of the H2  reaction are the same and the pop-
ulation of the 1NCN contribution under thermal equilibrium conditions 
remains small anyway. 

5.2. Singlet-triplet relaxation 

1NCN is the most likely initial species formed in kinetic experiments. 
Therefore, the timescales and mechanisms of singlet-triplet relaxation 
are  important  to  properly  evaluate  the  experiments.  The  singlet  and 
triplet  NCN  profiles  observed  by  Dammeier  et  al.  [82]  after 
shock-heating diluted mixtures of NCN3 in argon (Fig. 12) reveal that the 
fast formation of 1NCN (red curve) from the unimolecular decomposi-
tion of NCN3  is followed by a subsequent 1NCN decay taking place on 
about the same timescale as the observed delayed 3NCN formation (blue 
curve). The delayed formation of the triplet species was interpreted by 
Dammeier  et  al.  [82]  in  terms  of  a  rate-limiting  collision-induced 
intersystem crossing (CIISC) step, 1NCN + (M) → 3NCN + (M). CIISC was 
found to be pressure dependent with a temperature dependence result-
–1.  Addition  of  a 
ing  in  an  activation  energy  of  about  24-36  kJ  mol
collider gas different from argon, namely NO, NO2 and O2, significantly 
accelerated the CIISC dynamics; factors of 40 and 400 higher CIISC ef-
ficiencies have been reported for NO and NO2, respectively [112,114]. 
Dammeier et al. [82] also measured 1NCN and 3NCN profiles in room 
temperature 193 nm photolysis experiments of NCN3. Again, fast 1NCN 
and delayed  3NCN formation has been observed. Here, the fast initial 
increase of the observed 1NCN profiles has been attributed to the colli-
sional  relaxation  of  electronically  and  vibrationally  excited  1NCN*  (* 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience87(2021)10094012N. Lamoureux et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            

denotes the vibrational excitation). The somewhat delayed, more com-
plex  3NCN  formation  profiles  with  a  fast  and  a  slow  apparent  time 
constant  (the  latter  consistent  with  the  measured  1NCN  decay)  have 
been assigned to 3NCN* relaxation (of a rapidly formed triplet photo-
dissociation product) and CIISC of thermalized 1NCN. 

In order to further clarify the mechanism responsible for the delayed 
3NCN  formation,  Hetzler  and  Olzmann  [73]  performed  an  extensive 
study of the 248 nm photolysis of NCN3  over a temperature range of 
240-293 K and a pressure range of 1-80 kPa with different bath gases 
including Ar, Ne, Kr, H2, O2, and N2O. The reported temperature and 
to  be  consistent  with  a 
pressure  dependences  were 
found 
Landau-Teller/Schwartz-Slawsky-Herzberg  model 
for  V-T  energy 
transfer, and a two-channel vibrational relaxation model was suggested. 
In contrast to the interpretation of Dammeier et al. [82], in the model of 
Ref. [73] the slow component of 3NCN was not attributed to CIISC but to 
a  slow  vibrational  relaxation  in the  triplet  manifold.  This  implies the 
assumption of a prior fast ISC process. An interpretation with such an 
efficient singlet-triplet ISC pathway seems to be inconsistent with the 
reported high 1NCN concentration levels in the work of Dammeier et al. 
[82]. We note, however, that a one-to-one comparison of the underlying 
248 nm and 193 nm experiments is not warranted because of the much 
higher excitation energy in the 193 nm experiments that may populate 
higher electronic states with different dynamics. A possible dependence 
of the NCN spin multiplicity on the NCN3  photolysis wavelength was 
already discussed in very early works [6,132]. Clearly, the interpreta-
tion of the initial dynamics of the excited 1NCN and 3NCN species re-
mains  an  open  question.  In  order  to  shed  light  into  these  puzzling 
relaxation processes, Pfeifle et al. [124] performed a very detailed and 
so far most comprehensive theoretical investigation of the ISC mecha-
nism  in  this  reaction  system.  Based  on  multi-reference  configuration 
interaction  calculations,  they  conclude  with  the  surprising  result  that 
the experimental, relatively fast time scales (μs to ms range) for ˜a 1NCN 
→ ̃X 3NCN intersystem crossing can be explained neither by ISC channels 
resulting from surface crossings nor by mixed-multiplicity rovibrational 
gateway states. According to their work, surface crossing occurs at en-
ergies too high to be accessible under the typical experimental condi-
tions,  and  spin-orbit  interactions  are  generally  weak  due  to  the  large 
singlet-triplet  splitting.  For  example,  the  surface  crossing  with  the 
lowest energy barrier between the  ˜a1Δg  and the  ̃X3Σ(cid:0)
identified  in  the  bending  coordinate  at  an  energy  of  156  kJ  mol
(relative to the singlet minimum), that is by far too high to explain the 
fast  CIISC  observed  under  thermal  conditions.  As  outlined  by  Pfeifle 
et al. [124], future time- and state-resolved studies are needed to un-
tangle the different superimposed processes.

6. Rate constants of NCN reactions from theory and experiment 

Despite the possible interference of 1NCN chemistry, theoretical and 
experimental  studies  have  focused  on  the  theoretical  prediction  and 
direct measurement of the rate constants of 3NCN elementary reactions. 
From the experimental point of view, in particular for high-temperature 

studies and at elevated pressures, relaxation is fast and temperature is 
usually  still  low  enough  to  ensure  dominating  triplet  chemistry. 
Nevertheless,  one should  keep  in  mind that  in most  cases the  experi-
mentally  measured  rate  constant  represents  an  appropriate  thermal 
average and implicitly includes the minor or negligible contribution of 
the corresponding 1NCN reaction. Known exceptions have been already 
discussed in Section 5.1. 

Consequently, in the following sections on existing reaction kinetics 
work, unless otherwise stated, we continue to use “NCN” when referring 
to triplet NCN or at least a triplet NCN dominated overall reaction. 

6.1. Reactions involved in the CHN2  network 

As already outlined in the Introduction, illustrated in the schematic 
potential  energy  diagram  in  Fig.  1  and  confirmed  by  time-resolved 
measurements  of  CH  at  low  pressure  [21,133]  as  well  as  theoretical 
calculations based on TST-RRKM models [21,24], at low temperature (T 
< 800  K)  the  reaction  between  CH  and  N2  yields  an  HCNN  adduct 
through a pressure-dependent association step along the doublet surface 
(left direction in Fig. 1). At intermediate temperature (800-1800 K), this 
HCNN adduct rapidly dissociates back to CH + N2 [22,24]. At the same 
time,  the  activation-controlled  reactions  forming  other  CHN2  in-
termediates  and  NCN  + H  on  the  doublet  surface  (right  direction  in 
Fig.  1)  start  to  prevail.  Becker  et  al.  [133]  could  observe  the  related 
change of the temperature dependence of the overall rate constant (from 
negative to positive) for T > 673 K. 

6.1.1. The reaction CH + N2  ⇌ NCN + H 

At high temperature, NCN formation through the reaction between 
CH  and  N2  was  first  shown  to  take  place  on  the  doublet  surface  in 
quantum chemical calculations (mainly at G2M(RCC) level of theory) by 
Moskaleva  et  al.  [7,8].  In  the  same  breath,  Mosakaleva  et  al.  [7,8] 
postulated that the previously assumed spin-forbidden direct formation 
of HCN + N (R1b) should be obsolete. Instead, the spin-allowed reaction 
products  NCN  + H  (R1a),  in  subsequent  bimolecular  steps,  can  yield 
HCN + N along a quartet pathway or, alternatively, yield back CH + N2 
through the reverse reaction on the doublet surface (see Fig. 1). How-
ever,  the  initial  rate  constant  estimates  for  reaction  (R1a)  calculated 
with a multichannel variational RRKM approach in Ref. [7] turned out 
to be too low to adequately reproduce the measured NO species profiles 
in low-pressure flames as shown in Ref. [33]. As a consequence, merely 
the  product  channel  (R1a)  of  the  reaction  CH  + N2  has  been  imple-

been measured with and without the addition of nitrogen to the reaction 
mixtures, where the observed perturbation of the CH profile upon ni-
trogen addition was principally assigned to the CH + N2  reaction. The 
experiments  were  primarily  designed  to  prove  that  NCN  is  the

range 1950–3550 K, the authors reported a rate constant expression as 
in  Table  4.  Based  on  a  detailed  analysis  of  the  CH

Soon  after,  Harding  et  al.  [15]  performed  theoretical  calculations

uncertainties.  The  rate  constant  for  reaction  (R1a)  calculated  in 
Ref. [15] (see Table 4 and Fig. 14) was found in very good agreement 
with  the  experimental  values  reported  by  Vasudevan  et  al.  [31].  The 
dominant sources of uncertainty in their calculations were attributed to 
the energy of the saddle point connecting the cyclic HCN2 structure with 
the open-chain HNCN structure (see Fig. 1), which was reported with an

Rate constant expressions for the reaction CH + N2 → NCN + H (R1a) 
from the literature are collected in Table 4 along with the values of the 
NCN enthalpy of formation that have been adopted in the corresponding 
references.  The  rate  constants  k1a  are  plotted  in  Arrhenius  form  in 
Fig.  14.  For  clarity,  the  values  reported  in  Refs.  [7,33]  are  omitted 
because  they  considerably  differ  from  the  others.  The  experimental 
values reported by Vasudevan et al. [31] (symbols and black dotted line) 
are compared to results of theoretical calculations from Refs. [15–17] 
(green, black and blue solid lines) and to values indirectly determined 
from flame modeling [52] (red dot-dashed line). The values for k1a vary 
by more than a factor of four at 1000 K, but are closer to each other and 
in agreement with the shock tube data from Vasudevan et al. [31] at 
higher temperatures (around 2500 K) (see Fig. S3 of the Supplementary 
Material for a magnification of Fig. 14). Originally, Harding et al. [15]

determined a value of ΔfH
analysis of possible uncertainties, the now recommended lower value 
–1 (see Section 3.3) would increase their rate 
ΔfH
constant k1a by factors of 1.8, 1.25, and 1.1 at T = 1000 K, 1500 K, and 
2000 K, respectively, while it does almost not affect the rate constant at 
even  higher  temperature.  The  very  recent  pressure-dependent  rate 
constant  of  Klippenstein  et  al.  [17]  at  p  = 0.1  MPa  (based  on 
–1) is very close to the result of their previous 
ΔfH
calculations [15] when referenced to the same enthalpy of formation. 
Note,  however,  that  according  to  their  calculations  the  product 
branching  ratios  changed  because  the  collisional  stabilization  of  the 
HNCN intermediate was found to become important at low temperatures 
and high pressures. For example, whereas at p = 0.1 MPa and T = 1500 K 
the relative branching fraction predicted for the HNCN channel is only 
4%, it increases to 62% at 10 MPa at the same temperature. Overall, the 
good agreement of the results from all recent theoretical studies reveals 
a  reliable  prediction  of  the  rate  constant  k1a  and,  together  with  the 
recommended  value  of  the  NCN  enthalpy  of  formation,  of  the  rate 
constant k-1a of the reverse reaction as well.

The  importance  of  the  NCN  enthalpy  of  formation  (governing  the 
temperature  dependence  of  the  related  equilibrium  constants)  to 
calculate  the  rate  constant  of  the  reverse  reaction  (R-1a)  in  detailed 
kinetic models for NO prediction is further illustrated in Fig. 15. Here, 
the Arrhenius plot shows the rate constants k-1a(T) used or predicted by 
different authors; the corresponding expressions are listed in Table 5. 
The curves present the values of k-1a  obtained from theoretical calcu-
lations [16,17] (solid and dotted lines), from kinetic modeling of shock 
tube  data  [102]  (dashed  line),  and  from  flame  modeling  [52]  (dot--
dashed line). The rate constant determined by Faßheber et al. [102] is a 
factor of about 0.7 lower than those derived by Klippenstein et al. [17], 
but with a very similar temperature dependence. In fact, the rate con-
stant from Faßheber et al. [102] was derived from the calculated rate 
constant k1a proposed by Harding et al. [15] by adjusting the enthalpy of

proper modeling of prompt-NO formation. This will be further outlined 
in Section 8.

6.1.2. The reactions NCN + H → products 

According  to  the  theoretical  works  by  Teng  et  al.  [16]  and  Klip-
penstein et al. [17], the reaction NCN + H can proceed on a doublet or a 
quartet  potential  energy  surface  (see  Fig.  1).  On  the  doublet  surface, 
either the recombination product HNCN (R3) can be formed or, via a 
–1 
number of subsequent slightly submerged barriers lying 15–37 kJ mol
below the NCN + H entrance energy, the products CH + N2 (R-1a). On 
the  quartet  surface,  HCN  + N  (R2)  or  HNC  + N  (R4)  are  the  main 
products, initiated by the activation-controlled addition of the H atom to 
either the N or the C atom of NCN. Both theoretical studies agree in that 
the quartet reaction channel leading to HNC exhibits a sizeable barrier of 
–1 and even at temperatures above 2000 K contributes 
about 94 kJ mol
only a few percent to the overall reaction. 

Rate  constant  expressions  of  k2  reported  in  the  literature  are 
collected in Table 6 and selected data are included in the Arrhenius plot 
in Fig. 16. The first theoretical treatment of the reaction NCN + H → 
HCN + N (R2) has been mentioned as a side note in the paper of Mos-
kaleva and Lin [7]. Without giving further details, a first estimate of the 
rate constant for reaction channel (R2) has been reported in that paper. 
The  reaction  has  been  later  reinvestigated  by  the  same  group  [16] 
yielding very similar results (blue solid line in Fig. 16). Recently, Klip-
penstein et al. [17] presented a complete re-assessment of the potential 
energy surface of the reaction and reported a significantly lower (factor

To date, only two experimental shock tube studies are available for 
the reaction NCN + H → products. The first study by Vasudevan et al.

channel NCN + H →  HCN + N (R2) at nominally four different tem-
peratures between 2378 K and 2492 K (crosses in Fig. 16). The authors, 
after having determined the overall rate constant of CH + N2  and the 
yield k1a/(k1a + k1b), analyzed normalized NCN decay profiles observed

at longer reaction times by modeling them with the NCN reaction subset 
from  Ref.  [7].  The  rate  constant  k2  served  as  the  fit  parameter,  and 
values in agreement with those from Refs. [7,16] were obtained, how-
ever, with an estimated large uncertainty of about a factor of 2. Hence, 
within error limits, these data are also consistent with the lower theo-
retical rate constant expression given in Ref. [17].

The second shock tube work on the NCN + H reaction was performed 
by Faßheber et al. [102]; it provided overall rate constants over a wider 
temperature  range  between  962  K  and  2425  K.  The  thermal  de-
compositions of NCN3 and C2H5I were used for the production of NCN 
radicals and H atoms, respectively, with a large excess of the latter to 
ensure pseudo-first order reaction conditions. As usual, NCN has been 
detected by laser absorption of 3NCN and the initial 1NCN relaxation to 
3NCN has been treated as a CIISC process (see Section 5.2). Under the 
experimental conditions of their work, both the thermal decomposition 
of NCN3  and the NCN relaxation were fast compared to the observed 
3NCN  decay  such  that  the  overall  NCN  rate  constant  could  be  deter-
mined from the observed NCN profile in a straightforward manner and 
without  interference  from  initial  1NCN  chemistry.  The  results,  in  the 
–1, along with a least-squares fit are 
range (4 –  9) × 1013  cm3  mol
shown in Fig. 16 as circles and the black long-dashed curve. They reveal 
a  shallow  minimum  of  the  overall  rate  constant  at  a  temperature  of 
about 1100–1200 K that has been interpreted by the interplay of the CH 
+ N2 (R-1a) channel predominating at the lower temperatures and the 
activation-controlled  HCN  + N  (R2)  channel  prevailing  at  the  higher 
temperatures of the experimental range. It is tempting to attribute part 
of the observed rate constant increase towards higher temperatures to a 
possible increasing contribution of the 1NCN + H reaction of thermally 
equilibrated NCN. Note, however, that even at T = 2500 K, a 10% singlet 
contribution would require the singlet rate constant to be about 40 times 
higher  than  for  the  triplet  reaction  (see  Fig.  13).  Hence,  assuming  a 
(cid:0) 1, this would imply a singlet 
triplet rate constant of 5 × 1013 cm3mol
(cid:0) 1, which is well above the 
rate constant value of 2 × 1015  cm3mol
collision number. Consequently, with a maximum possible contribution 
of  the  singlet  reaction  of  about  a  few  percent  even  at  the  highest 
experimental temperature, the determined rate constants can be safely 
assumed to solely represent triplet reactivity. The grey shaded area in 
Fig.  16  highlights  the  reported  uncertainty  range  ≤ 30%  of  the  rate 
constant determination [102], mainly reflecting the uncertainty of the 
assumed  overall  H  atom  yield  from  the  two-channel  ethyl  iodide 
decomposition,  which  had  been  adopted  from  the  most  recent  global 
optimization study of Varga et al. [138], and the possible influence of an 
interfering NCN loss by the reaction NCN + N. No pressure dependence 
has been found over the experimental pressure range from 28 to 213 kPa 
–1 to be 
[102]. The authors discuss a value of ΔfH
most consistent with their rate data and estimate a robust upper limit of

Fig. 16 compares the overall rate constant of Faßheber et al. [102] 
with  modeling  and  theoretical  results.  The  black  dot-dashed  curve  is 
based on the modeling of prompt-NO formation in low-pressure flames 
by Lamoureux et al. [52] as it is described in more detail in Section 7.2.1. 
The  rate  constant  k2  was  adjusted  after  considering  the  experimental 
results of Ref. [102] and by adopting the rate constant k3 from Teng et al. 
[16]. As such, it is largely consistent with the experimental result for the 
overall rate constant. Also the most recent theoretical estimate of the 
overall rate constant (black dotted curve) from Klippenstein et al. [17] is 
in reasonable agreement with the experimental results from Faßheber 
et al. [102] within ± 50%. However, the global temperature dependence 
and in particular the temperature of the rate constant minimum is not 
well  captured.  This  has  substantial  consequences  for  the  prompt-NO 
switch temperature, which will be analyzed in more detail in Section 8. 
The calculated rate constants of the four individual reaction channels 
as reported by Klippenstein et al. [17] are included in Fig. 16 as colored 
dotted  curves  as  well.  This  theoretical  study,  in  agreement  with  the 

results of Harding et al. [15] and Teng et al. [16] (not shown in Fig. 16 
for the sake of clarity), predicts that at intermediate pressures CH + N2 
(R-1a) is the dominant product channel at typical flame temperatures 
(red dotted curve). However, the experimentally observed increase of 
the overall rate constant at temperatures above 1500 K indicates that an 
activation-controlled reaction may significantly contribute to the overall 
rate  constant  already  at  much  lower  temperatures  than  predicted  in 
Ref. [17]. In this light, the theoretically predicted rate constants of the 
reaction channels (R2) (blue dotted curve) and/or (R4) (green dotted 
curve) may be too low. In order to clarify this remaining discrepancy, 
Klippenstein et al. [17] also investigated potential additional contribu-
tions of channel (R4) resulting from ISC from  2HNCN to  4HNCN by a 
sophisticated  non-adiabatic  transition  state  theory  (NST)  approach 
[139]. Although ISC was found to significantly contribute to the HNC +
N channel by bypassing its high entrance barrier, the NST treatment did 
not change the overall picture very much. 

Finally, theory predicts that at lower temperatures and higher pres-
sures the HNCN-forming combination reaction (R3) may contribute as 
well  [17].  This  reaction  channel  exhibits  a  pronounced  pressure 
dependence  and  a  distinct  negative  temperature  dependence.  As  it  is 
reflected by the purple dotted curve in the Arrhenius plot in Fig. 16, at 
atmospheric  pressure  and  temperatures  above  1000  K,  this  reaction 
channel plays a minor role, but in high-pressure flames at p = 10 MPa 
collisional stabilization of HNCN may dominate the overall reaction up 
to about 1500 K [17]. To the best of our knowledge, no experimental 
data are available on this reaction channel so far. 

Clearly,  more  experimental  work  on  the  kinetics  of  the  important 
NCN + H reaction is highly desirable. For example, monitoring the yield 
of  HCN  (and  HNC)  in  experiments  similar  to  those  performed  by 
Faßheber et al. [102] could offer a way to further assess and resolve the 
issue of the high-temperature branching ratio and with it narrow down 
the transition temperature of the prompt-NO switch (see Section 8). 

6.2. Other NCN-consuming reactions 

Next  to  the  key  role  of  the  reaction  NCN  + H  for  the  prompt-NO 
switch  (see  Section  8),  a  full  mechanistic  description  of  prompt-NO 
formation  needs  to  account  for  other  NCN-consuming  reactions  as 
well. The products of these reactions open new or contribute to alter-
native NOx formation pathways aside from the Fenimore route CH+N2 
→ HCN + N. As it is the case for NCN + H, many of these reactions are 
characterized  by  a  complex  interplay  of  pressure-dependent  associa-
tion/recombination  reaction  channels,  typically  dominating  at  low 
temperatures and high pressures, and activation-controlled, often direct 
or indirect abstraction-type reaction channels, prevailing at high tem-
peratures. For such reactions, the rate constants and branching ratios are 
highly pressure- and temperature-dependent, often with a pronounced 
minimum  of  the  observed  overall  rate  constant  at  intermediate  tem-
peratures.  In  order  to  further  elucidate  this  common  behavior,  the 
following compilation of NCN-consuming reactions starts with the very 
prototypical  reactions  NCN  + NO  and  NCN  + NO2  despite  their  less 
important role for practical flame modeling. 

6.2.1. NCN + NO/NO2 

The reaction NCN + NO has been extensively studied over a wide 
range of temperatures, 251 K < T < 1659 K, and pressures, 0.3 kPa < p <
5.0 MPa [107,109,110,112], complemented by theoretical work [109, 
110,140,141].  The  very  good  agreement  between  theory  and  experi-
ment within their uncertainty limits underpins the current capabilities 
to  predict  and  measure  NCN  rate  constants.  Fig.  17a  illustrates  the 
schematic  potential  energy  diagram  for  the  kinetically  most  relevant 
pathways as derived by Huang et al. [110] on G2M(CC5) level of theory. 
The reaction includes both reaction pathways involving different elec-
tronic states (here, 2A´and 2A") and complementary pathways to either 
recombination  products  (trans-  or  cis-NCNNO,  marked  as  the 
blue-dotted box in Fig. 17b) or abstraction-type products, in this case

covering the pressure range 1.0 kPa < p < 5.0 MPa. The fall-off behavior 
could  be  very  well  rationalized  by  a  master  equation  analysis;  a  few 
selected data points and fitted rate constants from their study have been 
included in Fig. 17b as purple symbols and a curve for a pressure of 50 
kPa.  Moreover,  to  allow  for  a  comparison  with  the  only  available 
high-temperature  shock  tube  data  of  Dammeier  and  Friedrichs  [112] 
(star symbols), the dash-dotted purple curve has been calculated from

their reported Troe parametrization for a total density of ρ = 2.5 × 10

Calculated  potential  energy  data  are  also  available  for  the  similar 
reaction NCN + NS, where the NS radical is discussed to be an important 
intermediate combining nitrogen and sulfur chemistry, see Ref. [140]. 
The reaction NCN + NO2, which has been studied both experimen-
tally and theoretically, is another prime example of an elementary re-
action  with  association-dominated  kinetics  at  low  and  abstraction- 
dominated  kinetics  at  high  temperature.  Following  the  early  experi-
ment of Baren and Hershberger [107], who only reported an upper limit 
for the room temperature rate constant, Yang et al. [108] and Kappler 
[142] investigated the strongly pressure-dependent reaction by means 
of  193/248  nm  excimer  laser  photolysis  of  NCN3  combined  with 
laser-induced fluorescence detection of NCN, covering a wide pressure 
range of 15 kPa < p < 3.8 MPa at overall low temperatures of 255 K < T 
< 349 K. The somewhat higher rate constants reported by Yang et al. 
[108] are most likely due to interfering NCN loss from the reaction NCN 
+ O with O atoms stemming from NO2 photolysis. Nevertheless, both the 
consistently  reported  positive  pressure  and  the  negative  temperature 
dependencies of the rate constant are in agreement with an association 
reaction forming the recombination product NCN-NO2. At the highest 
pressures used in the study of Kappler [142], the reaction proceeds close 
to its high-pressure limit, hence a reliable high-pressure rate constant 
–1) and 
extrapolation was possible (k∞(298 K) = 4.4 × 1011 cm3 mol
the fall-off behavior could be accurately modeled. Quantum chemical 
and  statistical  rate  theory  calculations  were  performed  with  energies 
and structures obtained on the G2M(CC5) level of theory [108], showing 
that potential  decomposition channels of NCN-NO2  all exhibit  energy 
barriers higher than the NCN + NO2  entrance energy. Even at higher 
temperatures, these decomposition channels are not important because 
an alternative direct abstraction pathway forming NCNO + NO prevails. 
The  corresponding  switch  from  a  negative  to  a  positive  temperature 
–1 
dependence of the rate constant stemming from the about 40 kJ mol
energy barrier of the abstraction reaction and the expected vanishing of 
the pressure dependence has been confirmed by the high-temperature 
shock  tube study of Dammeier and  Friedrichs [112]. Standard Arrhe-
nius behaviour has been observed in their experiments at 704 K < T <
1659 K and 18.2 kPa < p < 65.4 kPa, hence putting the expected, not yet 
experimentally confirmed overall minimum of the overall rate constant 
to a temperature of about 500 K. Clearly, at typical combustion tem-
peratures  and  pressures,  the  reaction  can  be  safely  assumed  to  yield 
solely the products NCNO + NO.

6.2.2. NCN + M 

A first theoretical study dealing with the unimolecular decomposi-
tion of NCN was published by Moskaleva and Lin in 2001 [53]. It was 
shown that ground state triplet NCN isomerizes via a cyclic intermediate 
(c-NCN) to CNN, which decomposes mainly toward C(3P) + N2. Multi-
channel RRKM calculations were performed on the basis of molecular 
data from density functional theory and energies from G2M (RCC) cal-
culations.  Rate  expressions  for  the  different  reaction  channels  were 
derived  (note  that  there  are  misprints  in  Table  7  of  Ref.  [53],  see 
Ref. [18] of Ref. [116]). 

So far there are two experimental studies available on the thermal 
decomposition of NCN [111,116]. In both works, shock tube techniques 
were used with  NCN3  as  precursor for NCN and  with Ar  as  bath gas. 

Fig.  17. Reaction  NCN  + NO  –  recombination  versus  indirect  abstraction 
pathway. a) Potential energy diagram, adapted from the G2M(CC5) calculations 
from Ref. [110], and b) Arrhenius plot of experimental and theoretical data at 
comparable pressures and densities, taken from Baren and Hershberger [107],

drichs [112]. 

from an indirect abstraction reaction forming CN + N2O (marked as the 
red-dotted box). Recombination takes place via barrierless formation of 
the trans- and cis-NCNNO intermediate on the energetically less favor-
able  2A" electronic surface, followed by internal conversion to the  2A´
electronic  ground  state  surface  with  conical  intersections  located  at 
energies  significantly  lower  than  the  entrance  energy  of  NCN  + NO. 
Under such conditions, it is reasonable to assume that internal conver-
sion is not a critical rate-limiting step and can be modeled with RRKM 
theory assuming a transition probability of 1 [109,110]. The results of 
the  multichannel  RRKM/ME  simulations  by  Huang  et  al.  [110]  are 
included in the Arrhenius plot in Fig. 17b as dark yellow curves for two 
representative pressures of 11 kPa and 53 kPa. Due to collisional deac-
tivation of the initially highly excited NCNNO* adduct, the reaction is 
strongly pressure-dependent and exhibits the typical negative temper-
ature  dependence  of  a  recombination  reaction.  As  the  exit  barriers 
prevent dissociation into the products CN + N2O, the main product at 
low  and  intermediate  temperatures  is  trans-NCNNO.  However,  with 
increasing temperature an indirect abstraction pathway forming CN +
N2O becomes competitive, resulting in a distinct minimum of the overall 
rate constant. The rate constant of the indirect abstraction channel is 
independent  of  pressure  and  its  positive  temperature  dependence  re-
flects the involved activation barriers. The outlined mechanistic picture 
with  the  pressure-dependent  recombination  dominating  at  low  to  in-
termediate 
indirect 
abstraction dominating at high temperatures is fully supported by ex-
periments. Selected data have been included in the Fig. 17b for com-
parable  total  pressures  around  50  kPa.  Static  and  slow-flow  reactor 
experiments  at  low to  intermediate  temperature, performed  by  Baren 
and  Hershberger  [107]  and  Huang  et  al.  [110],  clearly  revealed  a 
distinct  pressure  dependence.  The  most  comprehensive  study  of  the 
pressure dependence has been performed by Welz and Olzmann [109], 

the  activation-controlled 

temperatures  and

Whereas  Dammeier  et  al.  [111]  monitored  the  NCN  decay  with 
narrow-bandwidth laser absorption, Busch et al. [116] monitored the C 
atom  production  with  atomic  resonance  absorption  spectroscopy. 
Despite  the  different  detection  methods  and  the  different  species 
monitored, the results of these works are in very good agreement. The 
reaction  was  shown  under  shock  tube  conditions  to  be  in  the 
low-pressure  second-order  regime  at  pressures  between  100  and  400 
kPa, which is in agreement with the predictions from Ref. [53]. 

In Ref. [116] also a master equation modeling was performed on the 
basis  of  molecular  data  and  energies  calculated  at  the  CCSD 
(T)/CBS//CCSD/cc-pVTZ level of theory. A stepladder model obeying 
detailed  balancing  was  used,  and  the  average  energy  transferred  per 
down-collision, ΔESL, was treated as the adjustable parameter. The fitted 
(cid:0) 1 appears a bit high for NCN collisions with the 
value of ΔESL = 1500 cm
bath  gas  Ar,  but  this  is  often  observed  for  the  stepladder  model.  The 
second-order rate expression obtained reproduces the experimental re-
sults from both experimental works [111,116] within their error mar-
gins. Arrhenius parameterizations of the master equation results for T =
1700–3000 K and p < 5 MPa are available from Table S8 of Ref. [116]. It 
also turned out from the quantum chemical calculations of Ref. [116] 
that the rate-limiting step in the decomposition of NCN is probably the 
c-NCN → CNN isomerization and not the bond fission reaction CNN → C 
+ N2 as proposed before [53]. The tight transition state for the reaction 
CNN → C + N2 found in Ref. [53] was identified in Ref. [116] to be not 
rate-limiting  because  an  energetically  lower-lying  pathway  directly 
leading to the products C + N2 exists. 

The overall reverse reaction, C + N2 → products, was also modeled 
by Moskaleva and Lin [53]. The calculated overall rate constant in the 
temperature range T = 2500–4500 K at a pressure of p = 100 kPa agrees 
very well with experimental values obtained in two earlier shock tube 
studies [32,134], though a somewhat higher activation energy is pre-
dicted. The by far dominant product channel at these high temperatures 
was calculated to be N + CN. A third-order rate constant of the C + N2 +
M reaction at room temperature and pressures of p = 20–70 kPa with Ar 
as bath gas was experimentally determined by Husain and Kirsch [143]. 
These  workers  assumed  recombination  to  be  the  dominating  channel 
under these conditions, a fact that was strongly supported by the cal-
culations of Ref. [116], where a direct recombination path leading to 
CNN via a small submerged reef but without a tight transition state was 
identified. This is confirmed also in two very recent works [61,62]. 

6.2.3. NCN + H2 

The overall rate constant of the reaction with closed-shell molecular 
hydrogen is expected to be well below the value for collision control. 
The reaction is of abstraction type, and the formation of the HNCN + H 
–1. The associated sizeable 
products is endothermic by about 91 kJ mol
activation  energy was  probably  the  reason  why  this  reaction  had  not 
been included in early flame mechanisms despite the fact that the con-
centrations of molecular hydrogen in flames can be high, in particular in 
the flame front of rich hydrocarbon flames. Indeed, in a combined shock 
tube and flame modeling study by Faßheber et al. [113] it was shown 
that the reaction can be significant for overall NOx  formation. With a 
–1 at T = 2000 K, 
directly measured rate constant of 1 × 1011 cm3 mol
it  is  about  25  times  faster  than  the  reaction  NCN  + O2  (see  Section 
6.2.5). Next to directly contributing to NCN loss, inclusion of the reac-
tion  NCN  + H2  →  HNCN  + H  into  the  GDFkin®3.0_NOMecha2.0 
mechanism [52] also made it necessary to account for HNCN and HNC 
secondary  chemistry, where  the  latter species  is  formed in  the  subse-
quent  HNCN  + O  →  HNC  + NO  reaction.  Interestingly,  the  updated 
model yielded an 8% increase of the simulated NO in the burned gases of 
a  rich  (ϕ  =1.5)  low-pressure  CH4/air  flame,  which  could  hardly  be 
ascribed to the 3.5% NCN forward flux resulting from the NCN + H2 
reaction  alone.  A  detailed  N-flux  analysis  revealed  an  important  new 
NOx  formation pathway through the reaction sequence HNC → HNCO 
→ NH2  → NH → NO, but in fact, HCN/HNC isomerization and not the 
reaction NCN + H2  turned out to be the predominant HNC formation

step. 

The initially reported activation energy of 101 kJ mol

–1 [113], while 
keeping the overall rate at combustion temperatures nearly unchanged, 
has very recently been updated to a somewhat higher value of 124 kJ 
–1 [80]. This change was necessary after it had been recognized that 
mol
toward lower temperatures the experimental data were biased by the 
corresponding  1NCN  + H2  reaction. According  to  VTST/RRKM  calcu-
lations based on CASPT2 energies,  1NCN directly inserts into the H-H 
–1 and decomposes to form the 
bond with an energy barrier of 74 kJ mol
nearly  thermoneutral  products  HNCN  + H.  The  alternative  channel 
–1  and  does  only 
forming  CN  + NH2  is  endothermic  by  96  kJ  mol
contribute to a minor extent, hence the main reaction products, HNCN 
+ H, are the same as for the 3NCN + H2 reaction. Allowing for both the 
1NCN  and  the  3NCN  reaction,  quantitative  agreement  was  found  be-
tween  the  experimental  data  and  the  theoretical  prediction  of  the 
pressure-independent rate constant. For practical use in flame models 
that typically treat NCN as a sum species, Faßheber et al. [80] also re-
ported an effective Arrhenius rate constant expression (assuming ther-
mal  equilibrium  between  1NCN  and  3NCN)  and  recommend  to 
implement the overall reaction with the reaction products HNCN +H. 
As  already  discussed  in  more  detail  in  Section  5,  the  1NCN  + H2 
reaction serves as a prototypical reaction to assess the potential role of 
1NCN chemistry in thermal system. Although the 1NCN insertion reac-
tion turns out to be much faster than the 3NCN abstraction reaction, with 
–1  at a 
a 140 times higher rate constant of k = 9.6 × 1011  cm3  mol
temperature  of  1500  K  [80]  it  still  proceeds  well  below  the  collision 
limit. This is in contrast to the H2  insertion reactions of other singlet 
radicals. For example, the reaction 1CH2  + H2  has been shown to take 
–1  from room 
place  with a  rate  constant of  k  > 5 × 1013  cm3  mol
temperature up to a temperature of T = 2500 K [127,144]. According to 
Faßheber et al. [80], the reduced reactivity of 1NCN is most probably 
due to the energy barrier resulting from the necessary rearrangement of 
the two unpaired electrons of 3NCN that are centered at the two separate 
N atoms. In contrast, in singlet radicals like  1NH,  1CH2, and  1O, both 
antiparallel  electrons  are  located  at  a  single  atom,  hence  ideally 
pre-configured for the insertion into the single bond of the co-reactant.

Briefly,  the  ab  initio  molecular  orbital  and  transition  state  theory 
calculations  on  the  G2M(CC1)  level  of  theory  with  CASPT3  and 
MRCI+Q refinements for barrierless association and dissociation steps 
have  been  performed  for  the  singlet  and  triplet  potential  energy  sur-
faces.  According  to  adiabatic  spin  correlation  rules,  the  triplet-triplet 
collisional  complex  may  be  of  singlet,  triplet  and  quintet  spin  char-
acter.  Although  not  explicitly  mentioned  in  the  work  of  Zhu  and  Lin 
[145], the quintet association may be safely assumed to take place on a 
repulsive potential energy surface; consequently, this state only needs to 
be included in the spin statistics for the calculation of the overall asso-
ciation reaction. Both singlet and triplet NCNO association complexes 
exhibit  exit  channels  to  form  2CN  + 2NO  with  energies  of  (cid:0) 173  and

channels,  4N + NCO and CO + N2, contribute to less than 1% [145]. 
Experimentally, the rate of reaction has been determined behind shock 
waves  with  O  atoms  produced  from  the  unimolecular  decomposition 
N2O + M → N2 + O + M. To assure fast O atom production, temperatures 
of T > 1826 K were necessary, hence the unimolecular decomposition of 
NCN competed with the reaction NCN + O. Nevertheless, as both rate 
constants for the thermal decomposition of N2O [146] and NCN are well 
known (see Section 6.2.2), also the rate constant for the reaction NCN +
O could be reliably extracted from the measured NCN profiles and has 
been  reported  with  an  uncertainty  limit  of  40%  by  Dammeier  at  al. 
[111].  Experimental  and  theoretical  rate  constant  estimates  are  in 
agreement within uncertainty limits. 

For  prompt-NO  modeling,  under  most  combustion  conditions,  the 
reaction NCN + O → CN + NO turns out to be one of the most important 
reactions and opens up non-Fenimore reaction routes for NOx formation 
(see  Section  7.2.3).  Next  to  directly  yielding  NO,  it  also  significantly 
feeds into the cyanide pool, predominantly forming NCO in the subse-
quent reactions CN + O2/OH → NCO + O/H. 

6.2.5. NCN + O2 

–1  s

In early attempts to model the NCN prompt-NO formation pathway, 
a high and temperature-independent rate constant of k = 1 × 1013 cm3 
–1  has been estimated for the triplet-triplet reaction NCN + O2 
mol
[47]. Flame modeling studies of El Bakali et al. [33] and Zs´ely et al. [51] 
showed that such a high rate constant would make this reaction one of 
the most important reactions for the fate of NCN in lean and stoichio-
metric  methane/air  flames.  However,  theoretical  G2M(CC1)  calcula-
tions  of  the  potential  energy  surface  by  Zhu  and  Lin  in  2005  [147] 
–1)  and  high  exit  barriers 
revealed  both  high  entrance  (44–52  kJ  mol
–1) for the formation and subsequent decomposition of the 
(86–89 kJ mol
NCN-OO adduct. Note that the reported entrance barrier is in striking 
contrast to the well-known, more or less barrierless formation of peroxy 
radicals in recombination reactions with doublet radicals,  R⋅  + O2  → 
R-OO⋅. The sizeable barrier may arise from the loss of resonance energy 
of the stable triplet O2 biradical [148] and the necessary reorganization 
of electron density going along with the formation of the unfavorable 
singlet  biradical  1NCN-OO  with  well-separated  unpaired  electrons 
located at the terminal N and O atoms. 

The rate-limiting step of the overall reaction is the formation of the 
reaction products NCO + NO and CNO + NO from the NCN-OO adduct 
taking place over cyclic transition state structures. In the temperature 
range 1000-3000 K, with a yield of 83%, NCO formation is the main 
product channel [147]. Transition state theory calculations suggested a 
very slow reaction with a four orders of magnitude lower rate constant 
–1  at T = 2000 K compared to the 
–1  s
value of k = 4.4 × 108  cm3  mol
initial estimate. This predicted very low rate constant, which makes the 
reaction NCN + O2 largely unimportant under typical flame conditions, 
has  been  more  recently  experimentally  confirmed  by  Faßheber  and 
Friedrichs [114]. In their shock tube experiments, up to 17% O2 in the 
reaction mixture was needed to induce a measurable effect on the NCN 
concentration-time  profiles.  At  such  high  oxygen  concentrations,  the 
modeling of the shock tube data was not straightforward. For example, it 
was necessary to account for vibrational relaxation of O2, which caused 
gradual  temperature  changes  during  the  experiment.  Moreover,  as 
already outlined in more detail in Section 5.1, the shock heating of NCN3 
in the presence of O2  revealed an unusual delayed 3NCN formation. It 
was  attributed  to  an  interfering  1NCN  + O2  →  3NCN-OO  adduct  for-
mation,  followed  by  a  rate-limiting  ISC  process  resulting  in  the 
re-formation  of  3NCN.  Despite  these  experimental  difficulties,  it  was 
possible to determine the overall rate constant for the reaction NCN +
O2 with a stated error of about ±57%. The reported Arrhenius activation 
–1  is in line with the theoretically predicted tem-
energy of 97 kJ mol
perature dependence but yields about a factor of five higher rate con-
stants as compared to the theoretical prediction of Zhu and Lin [147]. 
This is still low enough to make this reaction a minor NCN loss path for 
the  purpose  of  flame  modeling.  However,  from  a  theoretical  point  of 

view and in order to better understand reactivity differences between 
singlet  and  triplet  NCN  radical  chemistry,  it  would  be  interesting  to 
confirm the postulated activation-controlled formation of the 3NCN-OO 
adduct [114] by high-level electronic-structure calculations. 

6.2.6. NCN + OH 

(channel 

(a)),  and 

A critical review of the implementation of the reaction NCN + OH 
into prompt-NO formation mechanisms reveals some inconsistencies. To 
date, no experimental rate constant has been reported for this difficult to 
measure cross-reaction of two reactive radicals. An initial estimate of the 
high-temperature rate constant for the assumed main reaction products 
–1 [47], later turned out to be about 
–1 s
HCN + NO, k = 5 × 1013 cm3 mol
a factor of about ten too high. The two available high-level theoretical 
treatments of Zhu et al. [149] and Klippenstein et al. [17] significantly 
differ in the assumed main reaction products, but reasonably agree on 
the pressure- and temperature-dependent overall rate constant (within a 
factor of 2.5 – 5 at 1500 K < T < 2000 K at p = 100 kPa). The reaction is 
another example for a typical complex-forming radical-radical reaction 
(see  Section  6.2.1)  with  a  dominating  recombination  channel  with 
negative temperature dependence at low temperatures and high pres-
sures,  NCN  + OH  →  NCNOH 
three 
activation-controlled  exit  channels  on  the  doublet  surface  yielding 
NCNO  + H,  HCN  + NO,  and  NCO  + NH  (channels  (b),  (c),  and  (d), 
respectively). Another possible reaction pathway on the quartet surface 
yielding the  products NCOH  + N does  not play  a role for the  overall 
kinetics [17]. The resulting minimum of the overall rate constant at p =
–1 at a temperature 
100 kPa is predicted to be k ≈ 1.4 × 1012 cm3 mol
of T = 1000 K [149] and T = 1550 K [17]. The main differences between 
the  two  theoretical  studies  manifest  themselves  in  the  reported 
high-temperature products: channel (b) in case of Ref. [149], which was 
based on energies obtained on G2M(CC1) level, and channels (c) and (d) 
in case of Ref. [17], which was based on more accurate ANL0 energies. 
According to Klippenstein et al. [17], these discrepancies can be traced 
back to a systematic uncertainty of the G2M(CC1) energy, a previously 
unexplored dissociation barrier for the O-H bond cleavage channel (b), 
–1  nearly ther-
and a previously unidentified, with ΔrH
moneutral reaction path to NCO + NH (channel (d)). Summarizing the 
results  of  Klippenstein  et  al.  [17],  the  recombination  channel  (a)  is 
dominant  at  room  temperatures,  the  “new”  channel  (d)  becomes 
important at intermediate temperature, and the HCN + NO channel (c) 
takes over at T > 1600 K. Interestingly, the previously predicted main 
high-temperature  NCNO  channel  (b),  due  to  the  identified  reaction 
barrier, turns out to be unimportant.

Detailed pressure- and temperature-dependent rate constants, which 
have been adopted for the flame modeling in this work (see Section 7.2), 
are  reported  in  the  Supplement  of  Ref.  [17].  In  this  context,  it  is 
important to note that conclusions drawn from earlier modeling studies 
about  the  importance  of  the  NCN  + OH  reaction  for  prompt-NO  for-
mation needs to be regarded with some caution. Whereas early studies 
overestimated its influence due to too high rate constant estimates, later 
studies neglected important reaction channels (at the benefit to HCN +
NO) [49,52,150] or were (possibly) biased by flawed rate constant ex-
pressions resulting from typos and transcription errors [e.g., typo in the 
temperature exponent for k(H + NCNO) in Ref. [149] (0.97 instead of 
-0.97), adopted in Ref. [49]; suspected typos in rate constant expressions 
for  preliminary  data  reported  in  Ref.  [151],  adopted  in  Table  2  of 
Ref. [150], typo in the Arrhenius pre-exponential factor for k(HCN +
NO) in Table 5 of Ref. [52], but correct in simulations and in the Sup-
plementary Material]. 

Thanks  to the  theoretical work  of  both Zhu  et  al.  [149]  and  Klip-
penstein et al. [17], it can now be safely assumed that the overall rate of 
the reaction NCN + OH is too slow to make this reaction an important 
pathway  for  prompt-NO  modeling.  Nevertheless,  an  independent 
experimental  verification  of  the  predicted  low  rate  constant  value  is 
clearly desirable. In particular at high pressures, the formation of the

recombination  product  NCNOH,  which

thermodynamically stable even at combustion temperatures, may serve 
as a useful marker for the reaction flux proceeding through the reaction 
NCN + OH. 

6.2.7. NCN + CHn, (n = 1, 2, 3) 

Information  about  the  reactions  of  NCN  with  small  hydrocarbon 
radicals is scarce and, to the best of our knowledge, these reactions have 
not been considered in detailed flame mechanisms for prompt-NO for-
mation as yet. In particular, the reaction with CH3  radicals, which are 
abundant at relatively high concentration levels in the flame front, de-
serves attention and in fact turns out to be important in this work (see 
Section 7.2.3). Note that in rich laminar methane/air flames, high local 
mole fractions of CH3 of several per mill (hence comparable to the mole 
fractions of OH) are found at the peak position of NCN. Nearly all what is 
known about the rate constants and product branching fractions of the 
reactions NCN + CH, CH2, and CH3  dates back to early, very compre-
hensive  theoretical  work  performed  in  M.C.  Lin’s  group,  mainly 
accomplished in the Ph.D. thesis of Moskaleva [152]. Parts of the results 
for the reaction NCN + CH3  can also be found in an extended abstract 
book published in 2001 [153], and a summary of the rate constant ex-
pressions of selected reaction channels have been reported in Table 1 of 
Ref. [7], including some updates for the reaction CH2 + NCN. Potential 
energy diagrams of the various reaction paths have been mostly calcu-
lated  on  the  G2M(RCC)  and  B3LYP/6-311G(d,p)  level  of  theory,  fol-
lowed by multichannel canonical variational RRKM/ME calculations at 
atmospheric  pressure  and  covering  the  temperature  range  of  2000  – 
4000 K. All three reactions are fast and proceed with overall rate con-
stants that only weakly depend on temperature, mainly reflecting the 
temperature  dependence  of  the  initiating  radical-radical  association 
step. At a temperature of T = 2500 K, the reported overall rate constants

are k(NCN + CH3) = 4.0 × 1013 cm3 mol

–1, and k(NCN + CH) = 1.2 × 1014 cm3 mol
The reaction 3NCN + 2CH3 can proceed on the doublet and quartet 
potential energy surfaces. On the quartet surface, the CH3 addition to the 
–1. This 
C atom of NCN takes place over a sizeable barrier of 39 kJ mol
reaction  channel  yields  the  exothermic  products  1CH3CN  + 4N,  but 
except at very high temperatures (about 3% branching fraction at 4000 
K) cannot compete with the barrierless addition of CH3 to the N atom of 
NCN on the doublet surface. Here, at 2500 K and 100 kPa, the direct 
recombination  product  2CH3NCN  is  collisionally  stabilized  to  a  small 
extent  (14%),  whereas  the  main  reaction  products  1CH2NH  and  2CN 
(84%) can be formed over an energetically low-lying exit barrier. Note 
that in Ref. [7], the stated Arrhenius expression for this channel yields 
much lower rate constants than the Arrhenius expression reported in the 
original Ref. [153]. The accordingly, a factor of about 100 too low re-
ported overall rate constant at 2500 K in Ref. [7], next to the difficulties 
to account for subsequent CH2NH chemistry, may be one of the reasons 
why the reaction NCN + CH3  has not yet been considered in detailed 
flame modeling mechanisms (see Section 7.2.3.). In fact, its high rate 
constant  value  has  very  recently  confirmed  in  yet  unpublished  pre-
liminary experimental results of Hesse et al. [154]. In shock tube ex-
periments  using  NCN3  and  tert-butylhydroperoxide  as  precursors  for 
NCN,  OH  and  CH3  ((CH3)3OOH  →  acetone  + CH3  + OH  [155]),  the 
observed NCN decay profile, due to the very slow NCN + OH reaction 
(see Section 6.2.6), could be attributed almost exclusively to the reaction 
–1  and  a 
NCN  + CH3.  With  k(T  = 2000  K)  = 5.8  × 1013  cm3  mol
slightly  negative  temperature  dependence,  the  obtained  overall  rate 
constant  is  largely  consistent  with  the  originally  reported  theoretical 
prediction of Moskaleva and Lin [153].

The reaction  3NCN + 3CH2  can proceed on the singlet, triplet and 
quintet  potential  energy  surfaces.  According  to  Moskaleva  [152],  the 
reaction is initiated by radical-radical association on all surfaces, where 
1CH2NCN on the singlet surface turned out to be the most exothermic 
intermediate. However, energetically low-lying exit barriers prevent the 
collisional stabilization of this and of other intermediates. At T = 2500 K 
and p = 100 kPa, the formation of 2CH2CN + 4N on the triplet surface is 

predicted to be the main reaction channel (70%), but the isomeric iso-
cyano product 2CH2NC + 4N (8%) and 2CH2N + 2CN (22%), the latter on 
the singlet surface, contribute to the product spectrum as well. Note that 
a possible contribution from the quintet surface that also correlates with 
the  2CH2CH  + 4N  reaction  channel,  have  not  been  considered  in 
Ref. [152], and that additional multi-reference and non-adiabatic cal-
culations may be needed to properly account for the involved high spin 
states and potential ISC pathways. Therefore, facing the uncertainties of 
the reported branching fractions, it may well be acceptable to include 
the fast reaction NCN + CH2 by assuming the sole products CH2CN + N 
in future prompt-NO modeling mechanisms. 

Finally,  Moskaleva  [152]  considered  the  reaction  3NCN  + 2CH  to 
proceed  both  on  the  doublet  and  on  the  quartet  surface.  Following 
addition to the N atom of NCN, the intermediates 2NCNCH and (elec-
tronically excited) 4NCNCH rearrange and quantitatively decompose to 
form 1HCN + 2CN on the doublet and 3HCCN + 4N on the quartet sur-
face.  The  reaction  pathways  to  both  exothermic  product  sets  exhibit 
low-lying exit barriers, hence no intermediates are stabilized at a pres-
sure of p = 100 kPa. At T = 2500 K, the predicted channel branching 
fractions of 68% for HCCN + N and 32% for HCN + CN largely reflects 
the spin statistics of the formation of the initial collision complex. 

In summary, it can be concluded that the reactions NCN + CHx are 
fast  and  therefore  should  be  considered  in  prompt-NO  flame  mecha-
nisms. However, the possible branching into several reaction channels 
that fuel the N atom or CN radical pools adds complexity. Therefore, 
both high-level theoretical calculations and experimental measurements 
are  desirable  to  better  constrain  the  as  yet  unexplored  roles  of  these 
reactions. 

6.2.8. NCN + C/N/NCN/CN 

–1  s

The  significance  of  these  presumably  fast  atom-radical  or  radical- 
radical reactions largely stems from their roles under typical reaction 
conditions as they have been used for NCN rate constant measurements 
behind  shock  waves.  For  example,  at  not  too  high  temperatures,  the 
decay of NCN radicals in a typical NCN3 thermal decomposition exper-
iment is initiated by the self-reaction of two NCN radicals. Dammeier 
et al. [111] reported a rate constant value of k(NCN + NCN) = 3.7 ×
–1  and  postulated  the  reaction  products  2  CN  + N2, 
1012  cm3  mol
where  the  initially  formed  vibrationally  hot  C2N2  was  assumed  to 
instantly dissociate into two CN radicals. In their study [111], the fitting 
of the NCN decay curves were based on a too low NCN absorption cross 
section (see Section 2.4.2), hence the used NCN radical concentration 
were  probably  overestimated  and  with  it  the  rate  constant  value 
underestimated. In the most recent NCN shock tube study of Faßheber 
et  al. [80] a slightly temperature-dependent rate constant, k = 1.1 ×
–1/RT), has been reported (note the misprint of 
1013× exp((cid:0) 11.7 kJ mol
the  Arrhenius  A  factor  in  Table  1  of  Ref.  [80]).  Hence,  based  on  the 
updated NCN cross section and detailed kinetic modeling, up to a factor 
of  1.7  higher  rate  constants  were  found  to  be  consistent  with  the 
experimental NCN profiles. These higher values are still in agreement 
–1 reported earlier 
with the rough estimate of k < 1.8 × 1013 cm3 mol
by Benard et al. [122]. This value was deduced from the apparent life-
time of NCN in a flow reactor experiment where NCN3  was used as a 
precursor for an electric discharge-induced deposition of a solid carbon 
nitride film.

The relatively high CN  concentration  levels  generated in the  NCN 
self-reaction triggers the consecutive CN + NCN reaction. Theoretical 
results for this reaction have been included in Table 1 of Ref. [53] by 
Moskaleva  and  Lin  but,  to  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  details  of  the 
calculations have not yet been published. However, at a pressure of p =
0.1  MPa,  recombination  to  NCNCN  does  not  seem  to  be  important. 
Instead,  a  reaction  channel  exhibiting  an  activation  energy  of  34  kJ

Although  not  of  key  importance  for  accurate  prompt-NO  flame 
modeling, the much limited database on the reactions of C, N, CN, with 
NCN  calls  for  more  experimental  and  theoretical  work.  Quantitative 
detection  of  the  abundant  CN  radical  may  serve  as  a  worthwhile 
detection target to assess the internal consistency of the NCN reaction 
system. 

7. NCN as a product of the CH þ N2  reaction in flames: 
measurement and modeling 

NCN measurements in flames have been accomplished with in situ 
laser-based diagnostics, both in emission and absorption. Such experi-
ments remain very challenging due to the very weak signal levels and 
the presence of interfering species close to the NCN excitation transition 
along  the  main  band  head. In  this  section, we  present  the  NCN mole 
fraction profiles measurements performed using LIF and CRDS. Thanks 
to these experimental data, it has been possible to assess the robustness 
of the detailed kinetic mechanisms proposed in the literature. Here, for 
the sake of brevity, the comparison between the modeling and experi-
mental data is limited to two mechanisms and to the results obtained for 
rich premixed flames at low and high pressures. 

7.1. Measurements in premixed flames 

7.1.1. Evidence for NCN in flames 

Smith [38] was the first to verify the existence of NCN as a product of 
the CH + N2 reaction in a 4.0 kPa CH4/O2/N2 flame by LIF. NCN radicals 
˜
A – ̃X 
were excited at around 329.1 nm along the main band head of the 
transitions as recorded from an excitation spectrum. Fluorescence was 
collected at the same wavelength along the diagonal transitions with a 
bandwidth of 20 nm. The NCN relative concentration profile measured 
in this flame peaks in the vicinity of the CH profile maximum, as it is 
expected for a product of the reaction between CH and N2. In addition to 
the  NCN  spectral  assignment,  Smith  showed  that  the  LIF  signal  dis-
appeared when substituting N2  by Ar. Off-diagonal excitation of NCN 
along the Πu(020)-Σ(cid:0)
g (000) transition at 316.97 nm (Fig. 6) and fluo-
rescence collection at 325.9 nm was also demonstrated [43], but showed 
spectral interferences with OH and CH in a rich CH4/air flame at p = 0.2 
kPa. Since Smith’s pioneering work, relative concentration profiles of 
NCN have been measured in several low-pressure premixed flames using 
the same excitation/collection scheme [41,42,44,46]. Evidence for NCN 
in  atmospheric  premixed  CH4/N2O/N2  and  CH4/air  flames  has  been 
demonstrated as well [43,45], but with a very poor signal-to-noise ratio 
(SNR). 

7.1.2. Absolute quantification of NCN LIF signals 

The  quantification  of  the  relative  LIF  profiles  of  NCN  requires  a 
calibration step in order to convert the relative LIF signal into absolute 
NCN mole fractions. In a first interesting approach followed by Sutton 
et al. [41], the NCN LIF intensity was compared with the intensity of a 
nearby satellite transition of OH radical, which is more easily related to 
an absolute concentration value. By considering the spectroscopic pa-
rameters of OH and NCN and by comparing the LIF intensities of both 
species,  an  estimation  of  the  NCN  concentration  could  be  obtained. 
Unfortunately,  the  attribution  of  the  most  intense  feature  of  the  LIF 
excitation spectrum to the sole band head of the (000) – (000) transition 
led to a misinterpretation of the results in Refs. [38,41] (see also Section 
2.3 and Fig. 8). The second reported approach for quantification of NCN 

was based on directly measuring NCN concentration in a single suitable 
flame, which then served as a reference for calibrating the LIF profiles 
obtained  in  various  other  flames.  This  approach  was  followed  by 
Lamoureux et al. [42,44,68] by a combination of LIF and CRDS tech-
niques. While LIF is a highly sensitive technique with high spatial res-
olution, CRDS is a line-of-sight technique that allows one to quantify the 
absorbance across the flame diameter with very high sensitivity. 

–6  cm

–5  cm

The absorbance per unit of length of NCN was found to be very low, 
–1  only.  Thus,  a  technique  as  sensitive  as  CRDS  is 
around  10
required to measure NCN in absorption (see e.g. Refs. [157–159]). The 
principle of pulsed CRDS is the injection of a laser pulse into a resonant 
optical cavity consisting of two highly reflective mirrors. In this cavity, 
the laser pulse reflects back and forth and interacts with the absorbing 
medium, i.e. the flat flame, thousands of times. The main advantages of 
this  technique  are  firstly  its  intrinsic  insensitivity  to  light  source  in-
tensity  fluctuations,  and  secondly  the  very  long  effective  path  length 
inside the cavity. The reported detection limit of in situ CRDS detection 
–1  [160]. In practice, the laser is alternately 
in flames is about 10
tuned  off-resonance  and  on-resonance  with  the  absorption  transition. 
The off-resonance step allows one to measure the decay time of the laser 
pulse in the cavity in absence of absorption. In this case, the decay is 
essentially determined by the losses experienced by the laser pulse upon 
each successive mirror reflection (losses/pass). When the laser is tuned 
on-resonance, additional losses due to the absorption in the flame lead to 
a decrease of the decay time. The net absorbance can be obtained from 
the difference of the decay constants measured on- and off-resonance. 
Pulsed CRDS has been successfully applied for the detection of several 
species in flames involved in NO chemistry such as CH, CN, NH and NCO 
[161–164]. In case of NCN, this technique actually turned out to be more 
complex  because  of  the  compactness  of  the  NCN  spectrum  and  the 
absence of individual and isolated absorption lines as shown in Fig. 7. In 
addition, the measured decay times had to be corrected for the signifi-
cant variation of the cavity performance when scanning the laser over a 
large  spectral  range,  as  it  was  required  to  move  the  detection  wave-
length sufficiently far away (λ = 330.1 nm) from the NCN band head (λ 
= 329.13 nm) in order to obtain a reliable baseline. For a more detailed 
description of the complete calibration procedure, we refer to Refs. [44, 
68]. 

The first measurements of NCN using CRDS were performed in a rich 
CH4/O2/N2 flame at 5.3 kPa [42]. From the on/off procedure, a rather 
low  SNR  of  around  2-3  was  achieved.  In  order  to  increase  the  SNR, 
several  flames  of  different  compositions  were  tested.  Adding 
nitrogen-containing  species  like  N2O  significantly  increases  the  NCN 
signal [38,45], but at the expense of interfering absorption from other 
species.  In  particular,  the  oxidation  of  the  added  nitrogen-containing 
species  leads  to  the  formation  of  large  quantities  of  NH  radicals.  NH 
absorption lines interfere with the NCN spectrum as shown in Fig. 18, 
thus  preventing  accurate  NCN  absorbance  measurements  [165].  The 
best  compromise  up  to  now  was  found  in  an  acetylene  low-pressure 
flame [44] where the SNR was as high as 6. 

A portion of the NCN absorption spectrum around its most intense 
band head is shown in Fig. 8. Despite the very low SNR, one can indu-
bitably recognize the features due to the most intense band head of NCN. 
In  fact,  in  these  experiments  the  measured  loss/pass  at  on-  and  off- 
resonance  wavelengths  were  very  close  to  each  other,  as  shown  in 
Fig. 19. Since the decay rate was affected by additional non-resonant 
losses along the flame axis, the net absorbance due to the NCN absorp-
tion  had  to  be  determined  by  subtraction  of  the  two  black  and  red 
colored profiles in Fig. 19. The difference signal peaks at merely 4.5 ×
10-5 for a 6 cm flame path. Note that a very good agreement between the 
NCN absorbance profile (open blue circles) and the relative mole frac-
tion profile measured by LIF (black crosses) was obtained. Knowing the 
absorption  cross  section  as  determined  in  Section  2.4,  it  was  hence 
possible to convert the measured absorbance into a NCN mole fraction, 
yielding 326 ppb NCN for the investigated rich acetylene/O2/N2 flame 
[68]. This flame served as the reference flame for calibrating the relative

the very weak absorbance of NCN radicals in the flames, the concen-
tration measurements exhibit quite substantial uncertainty, estimated to 
about ±55% in Refs. [44,68]. The variation of the rotational population 
probed  at  different  flame  conditions,  using  either  LIF  or  CRDS,  was 
found to agree very well [68]. Therefore, the uncertainty of the relative 
NCN mole fractions reported for different flames is smaller, estimated to 
be 15% in Ref. [68]. 

7.2. Implementation of the reaction CH + N2  ⇌ NCN + H in nitrogen 
chemistry modeling 

The first implementation of NCN chemistry into a detailed kinetic 
mechanism has to be put to the credit of Glarborg et al. [47] as early as 
1998. However, reactions rate constants for the NCN oxidation (NCN +
O, NCN + OH, NCN + O2) and NCN reduction (NCN + H) were estimated 
with  relatively  high  values  in  comparison  to  current  recommended 
values  (see  Section  6).  Those  four  reactions  and  their  rate  constant 
values were adopted in the first detailed mechanism for NOx formation 
explicitly considering the NCN pathway by implementing the reaction 
CH + N2 ⇌ NCN + H (R1a) by El Bakali in 2006 [33]. It was validated 
against prompt-NO measurements in low-pressure flames [166–168]. At 
that time, the available experimental database consisted of CH and NO 
mole  fractions  in  several  low-pressure  premixed  flames  (mostly 
CH4/O2/N2, but also CH4/C2H6/C3H8/O2/N2, from lean to rich equiv-
alence ratio). El Bakali et al. [33] showed that the rate constant value 
reported in the seminal work of Moskaleva and Lin [7] was definitely too 
low  to  reproduce  the  experimental  results.  Consequently,  the 
GDFkin®3.0_NCN mechanism [33] adopted a rate constant for reaction 
(R1a) determined earlier by Lindackers et al. [134] for the reaction CH 
+ N2 → HCN + N (R1b). It turned out that, due to the very high assumed 
rate constant value for the reaction NCN + H →  HCN + N (R2), NCN 
radicals seemingly are immediately consumed yielding HCN, resulting 
in a very low mole fraction of NCN. This apparent “invisibility” of the 
NCN radicals explains why the historical Fenimore pathway (reaction 
R1b) was still considered in many nitrogen chemistry models for a long 
time after the initial work of Moskaleva and Lin [7]. However, with the 
detailed  knowledge  of  NCN  chemistry  advancing  over  the  years, 
including the experimental confirmation of much lower rate constants 
for the reaction NCN + H, it turned out that this simple conclusion does 
not hold. 

7.2.1. NCN modeling in low-pressure premixed flames 

As  described  in  Section  7.1.2,  NCN  radicals  profiles  have  been 
measured in low-pressure premixed flames by Sutton et al. [41,46] and 
Lamoureux  et  al.  [42,44,68,135].  These  experimental  studies  were 
combined to improve detailed flame modeling mechanisms. 

Sutton et al. [41,46,150] implemented the NCN pathway including 
the  reaction  (R1a)  with  a  set  of  NCN  formation  and  consumption  re-
actions mostly extracted from theoretical calculations performed by Zhu 
et al. [145,147,151]. This subset was also implemented in three revised 
mechanisms: GRI-Mech3.0 mechanism [169], GDFkin®3.0 mechanism 
[33], and USC mechanism [170]. In their later paper (in 2012), Sutton 
et al. [46] recommended to adopt the rate constant value of the reaction 
(R1a)  calculated  by  Harding  et  al.  [15].  For  different  premixed 
low-pressure C1-C4 alkane flames, the variation of the NCN profiles was 
compared to simulations. The experimental increase of NCN with the 
number of carbon atoms in the fuel and with the equivalence ratio was 
well captured by the models for rich, but not for nearly stoichiometric 
mixtures. 

Following the initial work of El Bakali et al. [33], the NCN subset 
reactions have been successively updated and validated up to the final 
NOMecha2.0  submechanism  [52].  It  involves  14  reactions  involving 
NCN, for which the rate constant values have mostly been taken from 
experimental  measurements  and  from  high-level  theoretical  calcula-
tions.  NOMecha2.0  has  already  been  combined  either  with  the 
GDFkin®3.0 model to describe alkane oxidation [33] or the acetylene

For example, the NCN peak mole fraction in a rich methane/O2/N2 was 
determined to be equal to 175 ppb in Ref. [68]. Note, however, that due

model proposed by Lindstedt and Skevis [171]. NOMecha2.0 was later 
satisfactorily  tested  with  the  additional  measurements  of  NH  in 
low-pressure premixed flames [161], and very recently in high-pressure 
premixed  counterflow  flames  [172].  The  mechanism  is  available  as 
Supplementary Material in Ref. [52]. Note that among the 236 reactions, 
the values of two pressure-dependent reaction rate constants (HCNO ⇌ 
HCN + O and NCN+H ⇌ HNCN) require appropriate manual selection 
because the input file is based on old Chemkin-II format. 

Recently, Glarborg et al. [35] proposed a complete revision of the NO 
formation mechanism, where the recent advances in the NCN compu-
tational chemistry were adopted. In their model (named KG-model in 
the following), the NCN subset involves 16 reactions (among them, 11 
are common with NOMecha2.0, but only 5 reactions are proposed with 
the  same  rate  constant  values).  Thanks  to  the  recent  high-level  theo-
retical  results  reported  in  Ref.  [17],  they  were  also  able  to  include 
pressure-dependent rate constant for the reactions CH + N2 ⇌ NCN + H, 
NCN + OH → products, and NCN + H → products. 

In the following, several modeling results are presented using the KG- 
and the GDFkin®3.0_NOMecha2.0 mechanisms as they were originally 
published,  including  the  thermochemical  data.  For  clarity,  the  NCN 
subsets adopted in these two models are reported in the Supplementary 
Material (Section C2). During the preparation of the present review, we 
have realized that the molar heat capacity of CH in GDFkin®3.0_NO-
Mecha2.0  and  the  one  of  NCN  adopted  in  the  KG-model  are  both 
inconsistent with the values reported in the majority of the other ref-
erences (see Section 3.2 and Fig. 11 for NCN). For consistent use of the 
published mechanisms, however, this was not changed here but later on 
for the simulations as presented in Section 8.2. 

Tremendous  efforts  have  been  devoted  during  the  last  decade  to 
better  understand the prompt-NO formation through the NCN radical 
pathway  [42,44,52,161–163].  For  that  purpose,  experiments  in 
low-pressure flames have been undertaken for measuring in situ tem-
perature profiles using LIF thermometry and in situ species mole frac-
tions profiles of NO by LIF calibrated by known added amount of NO 
[44]. NCN [42,44,68], NCO [163], NH [161] and CN [162] species mole 
fraction profiles were measured by LIF and calibrated by CRDS at their 
peak  values.  HCN  species  profiles  were  obtained  using  continuous 
wave-CRDS  after  gas  probe  sampling  [162].  Overall,  these  measure-
ments form a unique and original experimental database of trace species 
measurements  in  CH4/O2/N2  and  C2H2/O2/N2  flames. Therefore,  this 
dataset has been selected as a suitable validation target for testing the 
GDFkin®3.0_NOMecha2.0  and  KG-model  performance.  As  shown  in 
Fig. 20, for the low-pressure rich CH4/O2/N2 flame, both models satis-
fyingly predict the corresponding experimental NCN profiles. A general 
better  agreement  between  the  diverse  experimental  (symbols)  and 
calculated  (curves)  species  profiles  is  obtained  with  GDFkin®3.0_NO-
Mecha2.0 rather than with KG-model, except for the NCN profiles (in 
green) for which the simulated peak mole fractions are equal to 101 and 
127  ppb  with  NOMecha2.0  and  KG,  respectively.  Note  that  the  NCN 
experimental peak target value used here, 175 ppb from Ref. [68], is 
different  from  the  value  used  in  the  recent,  similar  intercomparison 
study presented by Glarborg et al. [35]. Accidentally, they used 135 ppb, 
a value reported in Ref. [44], instead of the later re-evaluated value of 
175 ppb from Ref. [68]. The experimental CH and CN profiles (in dark 
green and light blue) are similarly predicted by the two models and are 
in good agreement with the experimental profiles. A good prediction of 
the CH profile is very important because the CH radicals are key species 
of the initiation reaction CH + N2 ⇌ NCN + H (R1a). However, the other 
species profiles (NO (red), HCN (black), NCO (blue) and NH (pink)) are 
poorly predicted with KG-model compared to the good agreement per-
formed  by  NOMecha2.0.  Note,  however,  that  NOMecha2.0  has  been 
optimized  using  a  similar  set  of  validation  targets,  hence  the  better 
agreement of the GDFkin®3.0_NOMecha2.0 is not entirely surprising. 

As  mentioned by  Glarborg et  al.  [35],  a better  agreement of  their 
simulated NO profile with the experimental one (red curve and symbols 
in  Fig.  20b)  could  be  reached  only  if  the  rate  constant  value  of  the

profiles (symbols) measured in a rich CH4/O2/N2 flame (p = 5.3 kPa) with the 
simulated ones (line, same color as symbols) with a) GDFkin®3.0_NOMecha2.0 
[52] and b) KG-model [35]. For clarity, the error bar for NCN is shown in the 
negative  direction  only.  The  unique  data  set  used  as  the  validation  target  is

reaction  (R2) is increased  by a  factor of 4.  Such a  high rate constant 
value was not supported by their theoretical computations, but would 
also improve the agreement with the shock tube data on the total NCN +
H rate constant reported by Faßheber et al. [102]. Alternatively, Glar-
borg et al. [35] suggested that the underestimation of the NO yield could 
be  at  least  partly  due  to  the  missing  reaction  between  NCN  + CH3 
(introduced  in  Section  6.2.7),  which  has  not  yet  been  considered  in 
detailed prompt-NO formation mechanisms. We will test this hypothesis 
in Section 7.2.3. 

7.2.2. Modeling of NO profiles in rich high-pressure flames 

The  availability  of  NCN  profiles  in  atmospheric  and  high-pressure 
flat flames can serve to refine the detailed mechanisms of prompt-NO 
formation. In an atmospheric burner-stagnation flame, Sun et al. [45] 
measured the variation of the NCN fluorescence intensity as a function 
of ϕ in the range 0.9-1.6. The maximum was observed at ϕ = 1.2 for a 
CH4/O2/N2  flame.  Unfortunately,  as  previously  mentioned,  NCN  pro-
files have never been measured in absolute concentration in such flames. 
So, the implementation and verification of the NCN reactions subset on 
prompt-NO  formation  can  only  be  evaluated  by  considering  the  NO 
species  profiles  measured  in  various  flames  at  atmospheric  and 
supra-atmospheric  pressures.  In  the  pioneering  experiments  from  the 
Purdue group [173–175], absolute concentration profiles of CH and NO 
were measured in partially premixed and non premixed high-pressure 
flames by using calibrated LIF. In atmospheric flames, Konnov’s group 
already explored a large range of adiabatic premixed flames of alkanes, 
alcohols,  and  ethylene  in  which  the  absolute  NO  mole  fraction  was 
measured in the burned gases by using probe sampling techniques [176, 
177]  and  LIF  [178].  The  group  from  McGill  developed  a  careful 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience87(2021)10094023N. Lamoureux et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            

experimental  LIF  procedure  for  obtaining  the  absolute  mole  fraction 
profiles of CH and NO in premixed stagnation flames of C1-C4 alkanes 
and  alcohols  [179–181].  More  recently  the  NO  measurements  were 
extended  to  lean  supra  atmospheric  methane/air  stagnation  flames 
[182]. In counterflow premixed CH4/O2/N2  flames up to 0.7 MPa, de 
Persis et al. [172] measured by LIF the absolute NO mole fraction pro-
files at three equivalence ratios (ϕ = 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2). Such measure-
ments are difficult and rare, and the temperature determination is also 
challenging. All these data are very useful for testing and improving the 
prompt-NO  mechanisms,  but  should  be  also  complemented  by  addi-
tional NCN chemistry related species profiles wherever possible. 

In order to see the impact of the pressure on the NO formation, in 
particular the prompt-NO, the works performed in rich flames (ϕ = 1.2) 
from  Klassen  et  al.  [173]  and  from  de  Persis  et  al.  [172]  have  been 
selected to evaluate the performance of the GDFkin3.0HP_NOMecha2.0 
[172]  and  the  KG-model  [35].  Note  that  GDFkin3.0HP_NOMecha2.0 
denotes  the  high-pressure  (HP)  version  of  GDFkin®3.0_NOMecha2.0. 
This  HP  version  of  the  GDFkin®3.0  model  is  directly  derived  from 
GDFkin®3.0 initially developed in Ref. [33]. However, in the original 
version  of 
the 
pressure-dependent  reactions  were  not  clearly  indicated,  which  has 
been clarified in Ref. [172]. 

the  rate  constant  values  of 

this  mechanism 

The  performance  of  the  pressure-dependent  NCN  reactions  deter-
mined  by  Klippenstein  et  al.  [17]  was  tested  against  experimental 
measurements of NO in high-pressure (from 0.1 to 1.5 MPa) premixed 
flames stabilized above a McKenna burner by Klassen et al. [173]. Note 
that  the  temperature  was  only  measured  in  the  post-flame.  Conse-
quently,  the  simulated  temperature  profiles  had  to  be  calculated  by 
solving the energy equation assuming an adiabatic flame. In the case of 
the fuel-rich flames, NO is expected to be predominantly formed through 
the  prompt-NO  pathway.  The  performance  of  GDFkin3.0HP_NO-
Mecha2.0  and  the  KG-model  with  respect  to  NO  measurements  per-
formed in rich CH4/O2/N2  flames is shown in Fig. 21. Considering the 
uncertainty  due  to  the  absence  of  experimental  temperature  profiles, 
both models predict satisfactorily the evolution of the NO mole fractions 
in the burned gases as function of pressure.

GDFkin3.0HP_NOMecha2.0 has been tested against NO species profiles 
measurements performed in counterflow premixed flames stabilized up 
to  0.7  MPa  at  three  equivalence  ratios.  Both  the  GDFkin3.0HP_NO-
Mecha2.0 and the KG-model were shown to behave similarly. Fig. 22 
summarizes the experimentally measured NO peak mole fractions for a 
rich mixture at an equivalence ratio of ϕ = 1.2 in comparison with the 
kinetic  model  prediction.  Under  these  conditions,  where  prompt-NO 
formation  prevails,  the  predictions  from  GDFkin3.0HP_NOMecha2.0 
are in better agreement with the experimental data. However, at lean 
conditions  (see  Fig.  4  in  Ref.  [172]),  GDFkin3.0HP_NOMecha2.0  pre-
dictions  overestimate  the  experimental  results  while  the  KG-model 
predictions  remain  within  the  error  bars,  especially  at  increased 
pressures. 

7.2.3. Effective NCN consumption rates in typical flames 

In  order  to  get  further  insight  into  the  most  important  NCN  con-
sumption pathways in a wide range of experimental conditions, several 
literature  flames  [52,172,173]  have  been  modeled  with  NOMecha2.0 
and the KG-model in premixed flames from low (5.3 kPa) to high pres-
sure  (1.5  MPa).  Hereafter,  the  full  mechanisms  GDFkin®3.0_NO-
Mecha2.0  at  low  pressure  or  GDFkin3.0HP_NOMecha2.0  at  high 
pressure are labelled NOMecha2.0. For estimating the relative impor-
tance  of  each  reaction  involving  NCN,  the  relative  NCN consumption 
rate was estimated at its peak value in low-pressure flat flames (at three 
equivalence ratios, ϕ  = 0.8, 1.0, 1.25) and at ϕ  = 1.2 in the pressure 
range (0.1 MPa < p < 1.5 MPa (flat flames) and 0.1 MPa < p < 0.5 MPa 
(counterflow flames). 

Fig. 23 summarizes the behavior of the two models with respect to 
the most important reactions under these conditions. Here, the relative 
NCN consumption rates due to each reaction were calculated based on 
the species mole fractions simulated with each model at the NCN peak 
mole fraction for each flame condition, normalized to the corresponding 
overall NCN consumption rate. Note that in the KG-model, three reac-
tion channels have been declared for the reaction NCN + OH, yielding 
HCN + NO, NCNOH, and NCO + OH, but only the first one is included in 
NOMecha2.0  (see  Section  C2  of  the  Supplementary  Material).  Addi-
tionally,  as  suggested  by  Glarborg  et  al.  [35],  the  importance  of  the 
possible reaction between NCN and CH3 was examined by implementing 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience87(2021)10094024N. Lamoureux et al.

the very recent rate constant value for NCN + CH3 → CH2NH + CN from 
the Kiel shock tube laboratory [154]. However, as the product species 
CH2NH is neither defined in NOMecha2.0 nor the KG-model, the reac-
tion was treated as a dead-end reaction. 

From  the  sub-atmospheric  flames  to  the  high-pressure  flames,  the 
sensitivity  analysis  reveals  that  the  most  important  reactions  for 
modeling the fate of the NCN radical and the prompt-NO formation are 
NCN + H →  CH + N2  (R-1a) and NCN + H →  HCN + N (R2). Their 
relative importance increases with the equivalence ratio and decreases 
with pressure. According to NOMecha2.0, reaction (R2) prevails at all 
flame conditions, except in the lean low-pressure flame where the re-
action (R-1a) dominates. On the contrary, according to KG-model, the 
latter prevails at all flames conditions. This fact clearly shows the very 
much different assumed branching ratios of the reactions NCN + H in 
the two models, as will be further outlined in Section 8.1. Another dif-
ference between the two models is the importance of the recombination 
reaction  channel NCN  + H  →  HNCN  (R3).  According  to  Klippenstein 
et al. [17], this pressure-dependent reaction becomes more important at 
pressures  higher  than  1  MPa  and  significantly  contributes  to  the  NO 

decrease at very high pressures in rich conditions, in agreement with the 
experimental results of Ref. [173] shown in Fig. 21. The reaction (R3) 
remains negligible in NOMecha2.0. Finally, the fourth reaction channel 
of the NCN + H reaction, the reaction channel yielding HNC + N (R4) 
remains negligible at all conditions. 

In low-pressure flames, the third most important reaction is NCN +
O → CN + NO. Its relative importance increases from rich to lean flame 
conditions at low pressure. With increasing pressure at rich flame con-
ditions,  the  importance  of  this  reaction  decreases,  and  finally  falls 
behind the reactions NCN + H2 and NCN + CH3 whose importance in-
creases  with pressure. Actually, it is interesting  to see that the as yet 
neglected reaction NCN + CH3  turns out to be quite important. How-
ever, at low pressures the NCN consumption through this pathway re-
mains weak, but it increases with pressure at rich flame conditions. The 
reaction NCN + H2  → HNCN + H that is implemented in both models 
with  the  same  rate  constant  is  most  important  in  high  pressure  flat 
flames.  Until  recently,  this  reaction  had  not  been  recognized  and 
implemented into NCN submechanisms as a potentially important NCN 
loss pathway [80]. In an effort to clarify the importance of the NCN + O

et  al.  [102],  see  Fig.  16.  However,  the  predicted  temperature  of  the 
shallow  minimum  of  the  overall  rate  constant,  T  ≈ 2200  K,  is  much 
higher than the corresponding temperature of T ≈ 1100 K deduced from 
the  experimental  data.  According  to  the  GDFkin®3.0_NOMecha2.0 
model [52], which was adjusted to be consistent with the experimental 
data from Ref. [102], a minimum of the overall rate constant around 
1000 K allows a satisfying prompt-NO flame modeling (see Section 7.2). 
Fig. 25 compares relative branching fractions of the different chan-
nels of the reaction NCN + H according to Faßheber et al. [102] (dashed 
curves),  Lamoureux  et  al.  [52]  (dot-dashed  curves),  Teng  et  al.  [16] 
(solid curves) and Klippenstein et al. [17] (dotted curves). As previously 
shown  in  Fig.  16,  the  reactions  (R3)  and  (R4)  are  minor  channels  as 
compared to reactions (R-1a) and (R2), at least at low pressures and at 
typical flame temperatures. Note that both channels (R3) and (R4) were 
neglected  in  the  analysis  of  Faßheber  et  al.  [102]  and  the  reaction 
channel (R4) by Lamoureux et al. [52]. In general, the reverse of the 
prompt-NO  initiation  reaction  yielding  CH  + N2  (R-1a)  dominates  at 
lower temperatures and the forward reaction toward HCN + N (R2) at 
higher temperatures. The temperature at which the branching ratios of 
the two channels (R-1a) and (R2) intercept is called in the following the 
prompt-NO  switch  temperature, Tswitch. It  is  defined  by  the condition 
k-1a(Tswitch)  = k2(Tswitch)  and  represents  the  temperature  where  the 
branching of the reaction NCN + H switches between reaction (R-1a) 
(dominating at T < Tswitch) and reaction (R2) (dominating at T > Tswitch). 
Depending on the source of rate constant expressions used, it is equal to 
Tswitch  = 3415 K (Teng et al. [16]), 3235 K (Klippenstein et al. [17]), 
1440 K (Faßheber et al. [102]), or 1630 K (Lamoureux et al. [52]). 

As  a  result  (see  Fig.  23  in  Section  7.2.3),  the  KG-model  and 
GDFkin®3.0_NOMecha2.0  predict  a  different  relative  importance  of 
reactions (R-1a) and (R2) for prompt-NO formation. At the NCN peak 
location in the premixed low-pressure flames of CH4/O2/N2, the tem-
perature  is  around  1700  K.  This  temperature  is  close  to  the  value  of 
Tswitch derived from GDFkin®3.0_NOMecha2.0, but much lower than the 
value  derived  from  the  KG-model.  Accordingly,  the  KG-model  only 
slightly underestimates the experimental NCN peak mole fraction, but 
predicts NO concentration 50% lower than the experimental value as 
shown  in  Fig.  20.  In  contrast,  with  GDFkin®3.0_NOMecha2.0  the 
agreement with predicted NCN peak mole fraction becomes worse (45% 

and  NCN  + CH3  reactions,  further  calculations  of  these  flames  were 
undertaken using NOMecha2.0. First, the rate constant value of the re-
action NCN+O taken from [111] was modified within the experimental 
error bars (±40%) (see Section 6.2.4). Note that the rate constant from 
theoretical  calculations  [145]  was  adopted  in  KG-model.  The  modifi-
cation on both the NCN rates of consumption and the species predictions 
was found negligible at low-pressure. However, the simulated NO mole 
fractions in the high-pressure stabilized flat flames increase for p > 1 
MPa, reaching a better agreement with the experimental results when 
the  rate  constant  is  increased  by  40%.  Second,  the  NCN  + CH3  → 
CH2NH  + CN  reaction  was  fully  introduced  in  the  model,  using  the 
CH2NH subset from Glarborg et al. [183] instead of treating this reaction 
as  a  dead-end  pathway.  Only  a  slight  increase  (less  than  5%)  of  the 
predicted NO mole fractions was observed for all pressures and equiv-
alence  ratios.  Finally,  the  reaction  NCN  + OH  does  not  show  up  in 
Fig. 23. It was recently reinvestigated by Klippenstein et al. [17] and 
turns out to be much slower than many other OH radical reactions (see 
Section  6.2.6).  The  relative importance  of  this  reaction  somewhat  in-
creases with pressure, but remains negligible at low pressure. 

8. The prompt-NO switch 

Flame modeling of prompt-NO formation is directly associated with 
the intermediate NCN concentration. As outlined in Section 7.2.3 and 
illustrated  in  Fig.  23,  the  fate  of  NCN  is  largely  determined  by  the 
prompt-NO switch reaction NCN + H. Regarding the theoretical calcu-
lations performed by Teng et al. [16] and more recently by Klippenstein 
et al. [17], the reaction NCN + H proceeds via four channels yielding 
(R-1a) CH + N2 or (R3) HNCN along a doublet potential energy surface, 
and (R2) HCN + N or (R4) HNC + N along a quartet potential energy 
surface. The analysis of the formation of nitrogen-containing species in 
low-pressure flames by Lamoureux et al. [52] revealed that the sensi-
tivity of the reverse reaction (R-1a) NCN + H → CH + N2 is slightly lower 
than that of the corresponding forward reaction (R1a) CH + N2 → NCN 
+ H, but higher than the sensitivity of the reaction (R2) NCN + H → 
HCN  + N.  The  reactions  centering  around  NCN  + H,  as  depicted  in 
Fig.  1,  elucidated  in  Section  6.1.,  and  again  illustrated  in  a  compact 
scheme  in  Fig.  24.,  form  the  complex  CHN2  network  that  is  key  for 
prompt-NO modeling. 

The  most  relevant  model  parameters  are  the  rate  constant  of  the 
forward reaction (R1a), the equilibrium constant K1a, which is required 
for the calculation of the rate constant of the reverse reaction (R-1a), and 
the rate constants and branching ratios of the three remaining channels 
of the NCN + H reaction. In particular, a very sensitive balance between 
the dominating reactions (R-1a) and (R2) determines the setting of the 
prompt-NO switch, i.e. the dominating products of the reaction NCN + H. 

8.1. Relative branching fractions of the NCN + H reactions 

The theoretically overall rate constant of the reaction NCN + H → 
products predicted by Klippenstein et al. [17] at atmospheric pressure 
reasonably agrees with the experimental value determined by Faßheber 

Fig. 24. Scheme depicting the most important reactions involving NCN and H. 
Reactions (R1a), (R-1a) and (R3) proceed on a doublet potential energy surface 
(green), and reactions (R2) and (R4) on a quartet potential energy surface (red) 
(same color code as in Fig 1). NCN modeling is crucially dependent on the ratio 
of doublet and quartet reaction products. Factors a and b are introduced ad hoc 
in Section 8.2 to adjust the rate constants of the respective product channels.

the  line  styles  to  the  different  data  sources.  The  vertical  lines  indicate  the 
prompt-NO  switch  temperature,  Tswitch,  corresponding  to  the  crossing  of  the 
branching fractions of reaction channels (R-1a) and (R2).

lower than the experiment), but the simulated NO profile nicely fits the 
experimental data. Note that the experimental uncertainties were esti-
mated ±55% and ±10% for NCN and NO, respectively. 

8.2. Toward a recommendation of rate constants for prompt-NO switch 

In order to evaluate the rate constant parameter set used for prompt- 
NO switch modeling and to find a best-fit that minimizes the deviations 
between the simulation and the experiments, the rate constants of the 
four  NCN  + H  reaction  channels  were  systematically  varied  within  a 
limited  range.  Again,  the  rich  low-pressure  CH4/O2/N2  flame  whose 
species  profiles are shown in Fig. 20 has been chosen as  a validation 
target. The impact of these variations on the modeled peak mole frac-
tions  of  the  three  selected  species  NCN,  HCN,  and  NO  was  used  for 
validation  (targets  1,  2,  3,  respectively).  In  addition,  the  resulting 
overall rate constants for the NCN + H reaction have been compared 
with the experimental rate constants measured by Faßheber et al. [102] 
as validation target 4. As initial values, the rate constants of the four 
reaction channels (R1a), (R2), (R3) and (R4) were taken from a most 
recent theoretical work by Klippenstein et al. [17], implemented into 
NOMecha2.0. For consistency with these recent dataset, also the reac-
tion  CH  + N2  ⇌  HNCN  (R1c)  has  been  incorporated.  As  previously 
discussed  (Section  6.1.1),  the  calculation  of  the  rate  constant  for  the 
back  reaction  (R-1a),  sensitively  depends  on  the  thermochemical  pa-
rameters  used.  Here,  one  should  note  that  some  originally  reported 
thermochemical parameters (for CH in GDFkin®3.0_NOMecha2.0, and 
for NCN in the KG-model) are inconsistent with the values reported in 
the  majority  of  the  other  references.  On  the  one  hand,  as  shown  in 
Fig. 11 in Section 3.2, the heat capacity for NCN calculated from the 
NASA polynomials reported in Ref. [17] were not in agreement with the 
values recalculated from the most recent available molecular data set. 
On the other hand, the heat capacity for CH used in Ref. [52] deviates 
from  the  values  reported  in  the  extended  third  millennium  ideal  gas 
thermochemical database [184] or in Ref. [35]. So, in the following, the 
thermochemical  parameters  for  CH,  H,  N2  were  taken  from  the 
KG-model,  and  for  NCN  those  from  Harding  and  Olzmann  [37]  were 
adopted (the values used are compiled in Table S5 of the Supplementary 
Material). As outlined in Section 3, the most recent high-level calcula-
tions of the NCN enthalpy of formation by Klippenstein et al. [17] and 
Harding  and  Olzmann  [37]  agree  very  well,  therefore  the  thermo-
chemical data of NCN were not treated as variable parameters. 

The  relative  branching  fraction  between  the  different  reaction 
channels  of  NCN  + H  (see  Fig.  24)  was  studied  by  applying  two 
adjustable scaling factors, a and b, defined as follows. The rate constants 
of the reactions along the doublet path (i.e., yielding CH + N2 (R-1a) and 
HNCN  (R3))  were  multiplied  by  a  factor  a  (shown  in  green  color  in 
Fig. 24). Because reaction (R3) is much less important than (R-1a), the 
same scaling factor was applied to both reactions in order to restrict the 
number of parameters in this analysis. Note that multiplication of k-1a by 
a factor of a implies multiplication of k1a by the same factor because the 
equilibrium constant K1a  was independently calculated from the ther-
mochemical parameters of CH, N2, NCN, and H. Similarly, the factor b 
was applied to both reactions along the quartet path (i.e., yielding HCN 
+ N (R2) and HNC + N (R4), red color in Fig. 24). The influence of the 
relative branching fraction on the overall rate constant of the NCN + H 
reaction and on the prompt-NO modelling was examined after varying 
the scaling factor a from 0.05 to 3.0, and b from 0.05 to 8.0. Note that the 
parameter pair (a,b) = (1,1) corresponds to the original rate constant 
values proposed by Klippenstein et al. [17]. 

8.2.1.

Influence on the overall rate constant 

We assessed the influence of the channel branching on the overall 
rate  constant  of  the  NCN  + H  reactions,  koverall,  and  the  switch  tem-
perature, Tswitch, by varying the factors a and b in steps of 0.05 each. 

First, the overall rate constant used in our model was compared to 
the experimentally determined overall rate constant, kF, from Faßheber 

et al. [102] (target 4). To this end, we calculated a relative deviation, 

∫Thigh

/ ∫Thigh

Δk(a, b) =

|koverall(T; a, b) (cid:0) kF(T)|dT

kF(T)dT

with Tlow = 950 K and Thigh = 2500 K (hence covering the experimental 
temperature range in Ref. [102]) and with koverall(T; a, b) = a × [k(cid:0) 1a(T) 
+ k3(T)] + b × [k2(T) + k4(T)]. Here, ki(T) denotes the rate constant of 
reaction (Ri) as given by Klippenstein et al. [17]. A contour plot of the 
relative deviations Δk(a, b) is shown in Fig. 26. The deviation becomes 
minimal in the valley marked by the blue dashed line and it is around 
27% for (a,b) = (1,1). Note that an alternative scheme for weighting the 
differences based on a ln(koverall) and 1/T scaling (instead of koverall and 
T) yields comparable results (see Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Material). 
Second, the switch temperature as function of the parameters a and b 
was calculated from the relation a × k–1a(Tswitch) = b × k2(Tswitch). A 
contour plot is shown in Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Material. Tswitch 
decreases with an increasing ratio b/a and it is equal to 3235 K for (a,b) 
= (1,1). 

8.2.2.

Influence on prompt-NO modeling 

The modeling of the target flame was performed with the Chemkin/ 
Premix code. Each scaling factor a and b was varied with a step size of 
0.2, hence the parameter matrix represents 600 computational runs. For 
each sample run, the relative deviations of the peak mole fractions of the 
three species of interest (HCN, NCN and NO) were calculated (targets 1 
to 3). The relative deviation Δx is defined as the difference between the 
simulated species mole fraction value (xsim) and the experimental value 
(xexp), normalized by xexp: Δx = (xsim (cid:0) xexp)/xexp. The results are rep-
resented as contour plots for each species in Fig. 27. Note that the color 
scale is identical for all three panels. It was found that the relative de-
viations of the mole fraction of HCN and NO (panels b and c) follow very 
similar trends with varying (a,b), represented by hyperbola-like contour 
lines. The highest deviations occur at high or low values for a and b (top 
right and bottom left corners). In order to allow for a better comparison 
between different species, the iso-line for an exact agreement (ΔxNO = 0) 
between the simulated and experimental mole fractions of NO is plotted 
in all three panels of Fig. 27 as a yellow curve. It is almost identical to the 
iso-line for a zero deviation for HCN, which is plotted as a green curve in 
panel  b.  In  contrast,  the  deviation  observed  for  the  NCN  peak  mole

(see text).

to be increased by an unrealistic factor of 4. Accounting for the high 
experimental uncertainty in the case of NCN (±50%), the black dashed 
line represents a relative deviation of the NCN peak mole fraction equal 
to  –50%.  Hence,  agreement  of  the  simulation  with  the  experiment 
within error limit occurs on the right-hand side of this line. 

Interestingly,  the  relative  deviation  of  NCN  behaves  similarly  as 
Tswitch  (cf.  Fig. S5).  The  higher  Tswitch,  the  higher  the  simulated  NCN 
peak mole fraction. As it can be deduced from Fig. S5 in the Supple-
mentary Material, for a relative deviation of the NCN peak prediction by 
-50%, Tswitch is equal to 2000 K. 

8.2.3. Best-fit solution 

Clearly, the choice of the adjustable scaling factors a and b that de-
termines the branching ratio of the prompt-NO switch reaction NCN + H 
has  a  decisive  impact  on  crucial  quantities  of  the  prompt-NO  model. 
Fig. 28 collects the best-fit iso-lines (except for NCN, target 1) for each of 
the target quantities described above. The yellow and green hyperbola- 
like curves correspond to the zero deviation iso-lines of the NO and HCN 
peak  mole  fractions  (targets  2  and  3),  and  the  blue  dashed  line  to  a 
minimal deviation of the overall rate constant, Δk ≤ 0.1 (target 4). For 
NCN  (panel  a  of  Fig.  27),  the  black-dashed  line  indicates  a  ΔxNCN  =
(cid:0) 50% deviation of its peak simulation. In the selected range of the pa-
rameters, (a,b) ∈ ([0.2: 3],[0.2: 8]) where (a,b) = (1,1) represents the 
rate constant values reported by Klippenstein et al. [17], the NCN de-
viation  is  minimal  only  for  b  close  to  0.2  and  for  a  close  to  3  (see 
Fig. 27a). Finally, the black solid line represents a prompt-NO switch 
temperature of Tswitch = 2000 K. From the near coincidence of this line 
with the lower bound of the experimental uncertainty in the NCN peak 
mole fraction it follows that the NCN peak measurement favors a value 
of  Tswitch  > 2000  K. This is  because higher  Tswitch  values  result in an 
increase of the simulated NCN peak mole fraction, synonymous with a 
situation  where  the  NCN  concentration  is  mainly  influenced  by  the 
reversible reaction pair (R1a) and (R-1a). On the contrary, if Tswitch  is 
low, the NCN radicals are irreversibly consumed via reaction (R2) to a 
larger  extent,  which  acts  as  a  NCN  sink  along  the  HCN-yielding

the experimental value over the covered parameter range of (a,b); it is 
always underpredicted. For a better agreement, the factor a would have

Fenimore route. It turns out that HCN and NO kinetics are more com-
plex, and no such direct correlation between their prediction and the 
NCN  peak  mole  fraction  was  found.  However,  the  HCN  and  NO  pre-
dicted mole fractions tend to increase with the increase of the overall 
rate constant koverall. 

By combining all these different considerations, a best-fit parameter 
range  for  a and  b  can be  inferred from  the  quantities discussed  here. 
Keeping in mind that the corresponding experiments were often chal-
lenging, we assume that the maximum deviation in the NCN peak mole 
fraction  should  be  below  |ΔxNCN|  = 50%  (in  agreement  with  the  re-
ported  experimental  uncertainty).  This  corresponds  to  feasible  (a,b) 
parameter pairs within the hatched area (backward slash) of Fig. 28. For 
similar reasons, we allow for a maximum overall rate constant deviation 
of Δk < 0.8, which corresponds to the hatched area (forward slash) of 
Fig.  28.  The  overlapping  triangular  area  from  these  two  conditions 
would suggest a reasonable (a = 1.2, b = 4.0) pair in order to be fully 
consistent with the HCN and NO measurements as well. However, this 
parameter  pair  is  located  at  the  top  corner  of  the  triangular  double- 
hatched area, hence it corresponds to the maximum feasible deviation 
for  both  the  total  rate  constant,  Δk  = 0.8,  and  the  NCN  peak  mole 
fraction, ΔxNCN = (cid:0) 50%. Obviously, it is not possible to find a parameter 
combination that can simultaneously fulfill all four validation targets. 
Therefore, keeping in mind the uncertainties of all experimental quan-
tities  and  also  of  the  underlying  detailed  reaction  mechanism  and 
thermodynamic  data  used  for  the  simulation,  we  consider  parameter 
pairs  (a,b)  located  within  the  dashed  ellipse  in  Fig.  28  as  acceptable 
solutions.  Finally,  tentative  best-fit  rate  constant  expressions,  corre-
sponding to (a = 1.0, b = 3.0) and a prompt-NO switch temperature of 
Tswitch = 2080 K, are adopted in Table S6 in the Supplementary Material. 
While a = 1 supports the rate constant k–1a as given by Klippenstein et al. 
[17], b = 3 favors a value of k2 that is significantly higher than the one 
reported in the same publication but in much better agreement with the 
theoretical and experimental data provided by Teng et al. [16], Vasu-
devan et al. [31], and Faßheber et al. [102] (see Table 6). 

Note  that  this  parameterization  approach  was  performed  for  a 
particular target flame, i.e., a rich CH4/O2/N2 flame at p = 5.3 kPa. In 
this sense, the best-fit (a,b) parameter pair cannot be taken as a final 
recommendation  but  needs  both  a  more  extensive  validation  using 
different flame conditions and continued experimental work, in partic-
ular for the reactions in the CHN2 system. For the sake of completeness, 
in Figures S6 and S7 of the Supplemental Material we have provided 
plots of experimentally measured and simulated best-fit species profiles 
using (a,b) = (1,3) for several low-pressure CH4/O2/N2 and C2H2/O2/N2 
flames [52,161], including the rich CH4/O2/N2 (ϕ = 1.25) flame used as 
the validation target. The present results show a decrease of the simu-
lated  peak  mole  fraction  of  HCN  and  NO  compared  to  the  previous 
calculated data in all low-pressure flames. The change of the CH molar 
heat capacity  in GDFkin®3.0  model yields to a slight  decrease of the 
simulated CH peak mole fraction in the methane flames (Fig. S6). For the 
acetylene flames, modeling calculations were performed with the model 
proposed by Lindstedt and Skevis [171] that was slightly modified in 
Lamoureux et al. [161]. After combining this model (for the acetylene 
oxidation) and the best-fitted NOMecha2.0 model, the simulated NCN 
peak mole fractions agree very well with the experimental values. But 
the  calculated  NO  mole  fraction  in  the  burned  gases  are  found  to  be 
lower than the experimental ones and those obtained with the original 
model (Fig. S7). 

Similarly, the best-fit (a,b) parameters were also introduced in the 
high-pressure version GDFkin3.0HP_NOMecha2.0 after substituting the 
rate constant values (in PLOG format) from Klippenstein et al. [17] for 
the reactions (R1a, R2, R3, R4, and R1c). The predicted NO mole frac-
tions  are  reported  (solid  black  curves)  in  Fig.  21  and  Fig.  22  and 
compared to the experimental values obtained in flat flames and coun-
terflow flames from 0.1 to 1.5 MPa by Klassen et al. [173] and de Persis 
et  al.  [172],  respectively.  Compared  to  the  results  obtained  with  the 
original  GDFkin3.0HP_NOMecha2.0,  the  selection  of  these  best-fit 

parameters (a=1, b=3) yields a very small variation of the predicted NO 
mole fractions at any pressure. The largest variations are observed for 
the  flat  flames  stabilized  at  0.1  and  0.3  MPa,  but  still  within  the 
experimental  error  bars.  Consequently,  although  the  best-fit  analysis 
performed  in  this  work  has  been  restricted  to  a  single  low-pressure 
flame, it yields satisfying results for pressures as high as 1.5 MPa as well. 

9. Concluding remarks 

This article aimed at an outline of the current state of knowledge on 
the physico-chemical properties of the cyanonitrene radical and its role 
in  combustion  chemistry.  Spectroscopic,  thermodynamic,  and  kinetic 
data of NCN have been reviewed in considerable detail and discussed in 
terms  of  their  significance  for  an  adequate  modeling  of  prompt-NO 
formation.  The  most  important  role  of  the  reaction  sequence  initial-
ized by CH + N2  leading to NCN was highlighted, and the dominating 
influences  of  the  enthalpy  of  formation  of  NCN  and  the  relative 
branching  fractions  of  the  NCN  + H  reactions  have  been  discussed, 
including the role of the NCN spin state. A simple parameterization of 
these  branching  fractions  was  used  to  model  peak  concentrations  of 
several  species  in  selected  flames  to  compare  and  assess  kinetic  data 
from the literature. These modeling calculations confirmed the strong 
influence of the branching between the different product channels of the 
reaction NCN + H and the ongoing need for more detailed kinetic data 
on  this  reaction  system.  In  particular,  the  temperature-  and  pressure- 
dependent  switch  between  the  predominance  of  the  forward  channel 
to  HCN  + N  and  the  backward  channel  to  CH  + N2  needs  further 
investigation  because  different  models  predict  notably  different  tem-
peratures where this switch occurs. The accurate representation of the 
prompt-NO  switch  is  not  only  key  for  prompt-NO  modeling  along  the 
route, CH + N2 → NCN + H → HCN + N, but also for a better assessment 
of the role of alternative bimolecular NCN loss reactions next to NCN +
H. Here, in particular the reactions with O atoms, CH3 radicals and H2 
turn out to open new pathways under practical combustion conditions. 
In this context, also the role of singlet and triplet NCN and the mecha-
nism of ISC is of interest both for combustion modeling and from a more 
fundamental kinetic viewpoint. 

Overall, a lot of knowledge and understanding on NCN in general 
and on its role in combustion chemistry has been gained over the years, 
in  particular  over  the  last  two  decades.  Nonetheless,  a  number  of 
important open questions remain to be solved and further experimental, 
theoretical, and modeling work is required to advance the understand-
ing of NCN chemistry for prompt-NO formation in flames. Some exam-
ples necessarily reflecting the personal interests and preferences of the 
authors are:  

• the  still  puzzling  question  of  the  temperature  dependence  of  the 

branching ratio of the prompt-NO switch reaction NCN + H, 

• the need for detection and modeling of NCN chemistry related spe-
cies  profiles  (including  NCN  itself)  in  atmospheric  and  supra- 
atmospheric stationary flames,  

• experimental and theoretical investigations of the products and rate 

constants of the largely neglected NCN + CHn reactions,  

• experimental verification of the NCN radical enthalpy of formation,  
• a  closer  inspection  of  the  so  far  unexplored  role  [185,186]  of  the 

assumed Lennard-Jones transport parameters for NCN, 

• the elucidation of the molecular details of the 1NCN/3NCN ISC pro-

cess, and  

• a  more  rigorous  investigation  of  the  potential  influence  of  1NCN 
chemistry  in  flames  and  –  even  more  important  –  for  high- 
temperature kinetic experiments. 

The authors hope that from this by no means exhaustive list as well as 
from the entire review article, it may become evident that the NCN free 
radical  and  the  mechanism  of  prompt-NO  formation  are  rewarding 
future fields of research nicely illustrating the interconnection between

Dr.  Nathalie Lamoureux Nathalie Lamoureux studied phys-
ical chemistry at the University of Orl´eans (France), and ob-
tained her doctoral degree in 1995 with a thesis carried out on 
ignition delay times measurement of small hydrocarbons mix-
tures using shock tube apparatus under the supervision of Pr. 
CE. Paillard. From 1996 to 2004, she continued her research 
during different post-doctoral stays in France at the Combus-
tion and Detonation Laboratory of Poitiers with Dr J-N. Presles 
and Pr. D. Desbordes, at the Combustion and Reactive Systems 
Laboratory of Orleans with Pr. Paillard and Dr N. Chaumeix, 
and in Great Britain at the University of Aberystwyth (UK) with 
Pr. G. Thomas. She has performed kinetic simulations applied 
to NOx emissions in the oxy-combustion process and ignition 
delays in the detonation cells, and experimental works to measure laminar flame veloc-
ities, characterize the rapid deflagration and the transition of the deflagration on deto-
nation. In 2005, she joined the PC2A laboratory (Univ. Lille) as a research engineer in the 
group  of  P.  Desgroux.  She  became  an  expert  in  spectroscopic  laser  diagnostics  (Laser- 
Induced Fluorescence associated with Cavity-Ring-Down Spectroscopy) in order to mea-
sure absolute concentrations of trace radical species in low-pressure flames, dedicated in 
particular to a better understanding of the chemistry of prompt-NO formation. In 2013, she 
obtained her habilitation to supervise research. She was elected as member of the Board of 
the French Section of the Combustion Institute (2011-2019) where she served as treasurer.  

Dr. Pascale Desgroux Pascale Desgroux is Research Director 
at  the  CNRS.  She  received  her  doctoral  diploma,  devoted  to 
saturated laser induced fluorescence in flames, at the Univer-
sity of Rouen in 1988 under the supervision of Prof. Cottereau. 
She  has  solid  expertise  in  laser  diagnostics  (laser-induced 
fluorescence, cavity ring-down spectroscopy) and spectroscopy 
for detecting minor species in flames. Recent developments of 
laser  induced  incandescence  have  allowed  the  detection  of 
incipient (2-4 nm) soot particles in flames. She participates in 
the development of chemical mechanisms of pollutant forma-
tion  in flames  particularly  for the prompt-NO  formation and 
the nucleation of soot particles.  

She was involved in several European projects related with the measurement of soot 
particles and she coordinated research programs of the french agency for research (ANR) 
related with NO and soot formation in flames. She co-supervised 20 doctoral theses. 

She has served on the editorial  boards of Combustion and Flame (2008-2012) and 
Progress in Energy and Combustion Science (2015-). She is associate editor of The Pro-
ceedings of the Combustion Institute (2014-) and she was the Guest editor of the Special 
issue Laser Induced Incandescence (2013). She served the Combustion Institute as collo-
quium co-chair, colloquium coordinator and as member of the Board of The Combustion 
Institute.

Prof.  Dr.  Matthias  Olzmann  Matthias  Olzmann  studied 
chemistry  at  the  Technical  University  Merseburg,  East  Ger-
many,  and  received  his  doctorate  in  1985  with  a  thesis  on 
radical decomposition reactions. After 18 months of compul-
sory military service, he returned to Merseburg as a research 
assistant  in  the  group  of  K.  Scherzer.  In  1990/91  he  was  on 
leave as a travelling fellow at the University G¨ottingen to work 
with J. Troe. In 1999 he finished his habilitation at the Uni-
versity  Halle-Wittenberg  with  a  thesis  on  complex-forming 
bimolecular  reactions.  After  having  been  a  Visiting Assistant 
Professor  at  MIT  in  the  group  of  M.  J.  Molina  in  2000,  he 
returned to Germany to work as a Senior Lecturer at the Uni 
versity Karlsruhe. In 2003 he was appointed as a Professor of 
Physical and Environmental Chemistry at the University Wuppertal. In 2004 he moved 
back to the University Karlsruhe, which in 2009 became the Karlsruhe Institute of Tech-
nology (KIT), where he is now a Full Professor of Molecular Physical Chemistry. His major 
research interest is experimental and theoretical gas-phase kinetics and its applications in 
combustion and atmospheric chemistry.  

Prof. Dr. Gernot Friedrichs Gernot Friedrichs studied chem-
istry  at  the  University  of  G¨ottingen,  Germany,  where  he  got 
involved into the study of elementary gas phase reactions at 
high  temperatures.  Working  with  H.  Gg.  Wagner  and  devel-
oping  sensitive  frequency  modulation  laser  absorption  tech-
niques for shock tubes, he received his doctoral degree at the 
Institute of Physical Chemistry in G¨ottingen in 1999. Following 
a  postdoctoral  stay  at  the  High  Temperature  Gas  Dynamics 
Laboratory  of  R.  K.  Hanson  at  Stanford  University,  USA,  he 
continued his reaction kinetics work as a research assistant at 
Kiel University, Germany, in the group of F. Temps. In 2007, he 
accepted a call on an independent junior professorship in the 
framework  of  the  interdisciplinary  cluster  of  excellence 
“Future Ocean” at Kiel University and considerably extended his research agenda into the 
field of marine sciences with a focus on the development of laser spectroscopic techniques 
for trace gas detection and for monitoring processes at the air-water interface. Since 2011 
he  holds  the  position  of  a  tenured  Professor  of  Physical  Chemistry  at  Kiel  University, 
focusing both on reaction kinetics and surface-sensitive/quantitative laser spectroscopy 
with applications in combustion and environmental sciences.
