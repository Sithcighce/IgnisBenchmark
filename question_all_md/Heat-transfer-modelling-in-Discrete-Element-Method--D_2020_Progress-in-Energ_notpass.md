## Question 1

### 问题

Analyze the sensitivity of predicted indirect particle-fluid-particle conduction to the surrounding layer thickness δ and minimum conduction distance s in dynamic multi-particle systems based on the results of Lattanzi and Hrenya [121] shown in Fig. 4. Explain why in dilute systems (φ_s ≤ 0.5) the results strongly depend on δ but are insensitive to s, whereas in dense systems (φ_s > 0.5) the predicted indirect conduction strongly depends on s. What are the physical reasons for this differential sensitivity?

### 标准答案

In dynamic, multi-particle systems, the sensitivity analysis by Lattanzi and Hrenya [121] reveals: For φ_s ≤ 0.5, the percentage change in average indirect conduction %ΔH_pfw shows strong dependence on δ. When δ is altered from 0.2 r_p to 0.1 r_p or 0.3 r_p, the error can exceed 50% (Fig. 4a). This is because in dilute systems, particles are more mobile and have fewer enduring contacts. The surrounding layer method calculates conduction when particles are close but not touching. δ determines the range over which this conduction is considered. In dilute flows, particles frequently approach each other within δ, making the results sensitive to its value.

Conversely, in dense systems (φ_s > 0.5), the predicted indirect conduction becomes strongly dependent on s. Physically, s is related to the surface asperities and gas rarefaction effects. However, in dense systems with φ_s > 0.5, the predicted percentage change decreases when a larger δ or smaller s is used. The minimum conduction distance s physically represents the effective gap where continuum conduction breaks down. In static systems, s has a significant impact on total heat transfer (Fig. 3). When s is too large (e.g., s/r_p = 0.1, the predicted results become nonsensible. This is because in dense packings, particles are in persistent contact, and s acts as a cutoff for the integral that would otherwise be singular at contact. In dense systems, the number of particle pairs within separation distance < s increases substantially. Therefore, selecting appropriate δ and s values is critical, yet no rigorous guidelines exist, necessitating further work including delicate experimental measurements or DNS.

### 原文引用

**引用 1**:
> Opposite to what has been observed in static systems, the predicted indirect conduction shows strong dependence on the selected value of δ, e.g. over 50% error in predicting %ΔH_pfw when δ is altered from 0.2 r_p to 0.1 r_p or 0.3 r_p over the range of φ_s ∈ [0, 0.6].

**引用 2**:
> Noticeably, the predicted indirect conduction is insensitive to the selected value of s for φ_s ≤ 0.5 and becomes strongly dependent on s only in very dense particulate systems (e.g. packed beds). However, consistent with those in static systems, the predicted percentage change in the average indirect conduction heat transfer decreases when a larger δ or a smaller s is used.
