## Question 1

### 问题

In the development of the reference Langevin model for the velocity of the fluid seen Us(t) in polydisperse two-phase flows, the paper states that 'the model reverts continuously to the Simplified Langevin Model (SLM) developed by Pope for turbulent reactive single-phase flows when particle inertia decreases (i.e. tp → 0)'. Explain the physical significance of this continuous reversion to the fluid-particle limit. Mathematically derive the conditions under which the Langevin model for Us(t) in Eq. (43) reduces to the SLM in Eq. (55), and analyze why this property is critical for any acceptable stochastic model in two-phase flow simulations.

### 标准答案

The physical significance lies in ensuring consistency between particle and fluid tracer statistics when inertia vanishes. The Langevin model for Us(t) in Eq. (43) includes terms accounting for crossing-trajectory effects (CTE) via the Csanady factors in Hij. Starting from the general form: dUs,i = [-(1/ρf)∂⟨Pf⟩/∂xi + (⟨Up,j⟩ - ⟨Uf,j⟩)(∂⟨Uf,i⟩/∂xj) dt + G*(ij)(Us,j - ⟨Uf,j⟩) dt + Bs,ij dWj, where G*(ij) = -(1/2 + 3/4 C0)ε/k δij + Hij. As tp → 0, the particle relaxation timescale becomes negligible compared to turbulent timescales. When tp ≪ Dt (time step), particle velocities rapidly equilibrate to the fluid seen velocities (Up ≈ Us). The drift term G*(ij) must dominate, and the model must replicate fluid particle dispersion. The derivation involves setting tp → 0 in the drift coefficient containing (Us - Up)/tp, which becomes dominant and requires the diffusion matrix Bs to satisfy BsBs^T = L, with Lij = L⊥δij + (L∥ - L⊥)rirj. Specifically, the term (⟨Up,j⟩ - ⟨Uf,j⟩)(∂⟨Uf,i⟩/∂xj) ensures that the model reproduces the correct fluid kinetic energy decay rate. This property is critical because an inconsistent model would produce spurious drifts or incorrect turbulent dispersion in the tracer limit, violating fundamental conservation laws and yielding unphysical results in near-wall regions or homogeneous turbulence.

## Question 2

### 问题

The paper discusses that 'Langevin models include only the sum of two contributions: a pure-order term and a pure-disorder term.' Explain how this fluctuation-dissipation formulation leads to Gaussian conditional increments but can produce non-Gaussian PDFs. Derive the relationship between non-constant diffusion coefficients and deviations from Gaussianity in stochastic diffusion processes. Provide a mathematical proof showing that a constant diffusion coefficient B(t,x) yields Gaussian statistics, while a spatially-dependent B(t,x) induces non-Gaussian PDFs. Use the example of dXt = Xt dWt and demonstrate with simulation results how a variable diffusion coefficient in the near-wall region generates skewed velocity distributions observed in DNS.

### 标准答案

For a 1D stochastic diffusion process dXt = A(t,Xt)dt + B(t,Xt)dWt, the conditional increment ΔX|(X(t)=x) over Dt is Gaussian due to dWt ~ N(0,Dt). If B is constant, the process Xt becomes Gaussian (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process). The Fokkere-Planck equation is ∂p/∂t = -∂/∂x[A p] + 1/2 ∂²/∂x²[B² p]. When B depends on x, the conditional increments remain Gaussian, but the marginal distribution p(t,x) becomes non-Gaussian. The proof follows from the discrete Euler scheme: ΔX = A Dt + B √Dt ζ, where ζ is standard normal. The variance of conditional increments is ⟨(ΔX)²⟩ = B² Dt. If B(x) varies spatially, the equilibrium distribution p_eq(x) ∝ exp[∫(2A/B²) dx], which is non-Gaussian. This is illustrated in Fig. 3, where a spatially-dependent diffusion coefficient in a GLM with near-wall corrections produces non-Gaussian PDFs matching DNS data. This demonstrates that Langevin models can capture complex turbulence statistics beyond simple Gaussian assumptions, crucial for modeling inertial particle preferential concentration in turbulent boundary layers.

## Question 3

### 问题

The paper discusses the importance of the 'particle state vector' choice, emphasizing that 'this choice determines the information contained in the resulting PDF description'. Analyze how the selection of Z = (xp, Up, Us) as the standard state vector is justified by the fast-variable elimination principle. Mathematically derive why including Us in the state vector leads to a Markov process. Use the example of high Reynolds-number turbulent flows where fluid particle acceleration is a fast process. Show mathematically how eliminating fast variables leads to white-noise terms in stochastic diffusion models. Use the mechanical equation dUp/dt = (Us - Up)/tp + g, and explain how this enables accurate treatment of particle-fluid interactions in non-homogeneous flows.

### 标准答案

The fast-variable elimination technique relies on the separation of scales between slow modes (particle position and velocity) and fast modes (fluid acceleration). When the observation timescale Dt is much larger than the Kolmogorov timescale tη, the unresolved fluid acceleration acts as a rapid noise source. The derivation follows from projecting the unresolved dynamics onto the slow manifold. For the particle momentum equation, the unresolved fluid acceleration timescale is O(tη), while particle relaxation timescale tp can be comparable or larger. For example, when Dt ≫ tη, the fast modes reach equilibrium and can be modeled as dUs,i = - (Us,i/T*L,(i))) dt + √(2σ²_sg/T*L,(i))) dWi. This ensures the stochastic model remains computationally tractable while capturing essential physics of turbulent dispersion and two-way coupling effects in industrial applications like coal-biomass co-firing.
