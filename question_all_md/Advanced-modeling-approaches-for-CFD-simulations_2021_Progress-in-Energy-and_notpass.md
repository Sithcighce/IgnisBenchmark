## Question 1

### 问题

Derive the effectiveness factor η for char conversion considering both pore diffusion and reaction kinetics in spherical coordinates, explaining the physical significance of the Thiele modulus φ.

### 标准答案

For spherical char particles, the effectiveness factor η is derived from the Thiele modulus φ which compares reaction rate to diffusion rate: φ = L√(k_v/D_eff) where L is characteristic length (R_p/3 for spheres), k_v is volumetric reaction rate, and D_eff is effective diffusivity. The exact solution for first-order reactions gives η = (3/φ)[1/tanh(φ) - 1/φ]. Physically, when φ<0.3 (kinetic control), η≈1 as diffusion is fast. When φ>3 (diffusion control), η≈3/φ as reactions concentrate near particle surface. The parallel path pore model modifies D_eff = ε(D_ij*f/τ) accounting for porosity ε and tortuosity τ. For nth-order reactions, a correction factor is needed: η_corr = η/(1 + βη) where β = (n-1)C_s/C_ref. In Zone II (transition regime), the apparent reaction order n_app = (n+1)/2 due to pore diffusion effects.
