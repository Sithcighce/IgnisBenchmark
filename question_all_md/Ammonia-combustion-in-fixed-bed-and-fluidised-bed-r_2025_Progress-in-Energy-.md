## Question 1

### 问题

What are the key challenges associated with ammonia (NH3) combustion in traditional systems compared to conventional hydrocarbon fuels? Explain the thermophysical properties of NH3 that contribute to these challenges and how fluidized-bed combustion can mitigate them.

### 标准答案

The key challenges of NH3 combustion in traditional systems include its high autoignition temperature (~930 K), large ignition energy (~20 mJ at φ=1), high lower flammability limit (15-28% V/V), slow laminar flame speed (~6.5 cm/s at φ=1), and low heating value (18.6 MJ/kg). These properties make NH3 difficult to ignite and sustain stable combustion. The high autoignition temperature requires higher operating temperatures, while the large ignition energy demands stronger ignition sources. The high LFL limits operational flexibility, and the slow flame speed reduces combustion intensity. Fluidized-bed combustion mitigates these challenges through the bed material's heat reservoir effect, which ensures reliable ignition and stable combustion at lower temperatures. The excellent heat and mass transfer in fluidized beds also enhances burning rates and flame stability, overcoming NH3's poor combustion characteristics.

**引用 1**:
> Relative to conventional hydrocarbon fuels, however, NH3 faces several challenges when used in current combustion systems, including elevated autoignition temperature, large ignition energy, high lower flammability limit (LFL), slow flame propagation speed, and potentially high nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission [3–7].

**引用 2**:

## Question 2

### 问题

Explain the role of bed material in NOx formation and destruction during ammonia combustion in a fluidized-bed reactor. How does the presence of solid media affect the NOx chemistry compared to a flow reactor?

### 标准答案

The bed material in a fluidized-bed reactor plays a dual role in NOx formation and destruction during NH3 combustion. Firstly, it acts as a thermal sink, reducing local peak temperatures and thus minimizing thermal NOx formation via the Zeldovich mechanism. Secondly, the bed material can catalytically promote NOx reduction pathways, such as the reaction between NH3 and NO to form N2 (De-NOx process). Experimental studies show that fixed-bed reactors with quartz particles significantly reduce NOx emissions compared to flow reactors, e.g., from 1969 ppm to 25 ppm at φ=0.5 and 1350 K. This reduction is attributed to: (1) enhanced NH3 dissociation into radicals that lower reaction temperatures, (2) preferential NOx reduction by NH3 on particle surfaces, and (3) altered reaction pathways that favor N2 formation over NOx. The solid media's large surface area facilitates more efficient radical recombination and heterogeneous reactions that suppress NOx formation.

### 原文引用

**引用 1**:
> The presence of a quartz fixed-bed, compared to a flow reactor, resulted in significantly reduced NOx emissions at lean and stoichiometric equivalence ratios. At 1350 K, for example, the NO concentration was 1969 ppm in the flow reactor compared to 25 ppm in the fixed-bed reactor at φ = 0.5.

**引用 2**:
> Several possibilities exist for NOx curtailment in the presence of solid bed material: (1) greater NH3 dissociation into respective radicals, thus lowering the reaction temperature and reducing ease of NOx formation, (2) preference for the reduction reaction of NOx with NH3, and (3) increased prevalence of side-reactions that do not favour NOx formation.

## Question 3

### 问题

Calculate the mass flow rate of ammonia required for a 660 MW power plant operating at 55% efficiency, given NH3's lower heating value of 18.6 MJ/kg. Compare this with the equivalent methane requirement (LHV=50 MJ/kg) and discuss the implications for reactor design.

### 标准答案

For a 660 MW plant at 55% efficiency, the required thermal input is: 660 MW / 0.55 = 1200 MW = 4,320,000 MJ/h. With NH3's LHV of 18.6 MJ/kg, the mass flow rate is: 4,320,000 MJ/h / 18.6 MJ/kg = 232,258 kg/h (232 t/h). For methane with LHV=50 MJ/kg, the flow rate would be: 4,320,000 / 50 = 86,400 kg/h (86.4 t/h). This 2.7× higher mass flow rate for NH3 has significant implications: 1) Larger fuel storage and handling systems are needed, 2) The fluidized-bed reactor must accommodate higher volumetric flow rates, affecting minimum fluidization velocity and bed dimensions, 3) The higher nitrogen content increases NOx formation potential, requiring more sophisticated emission control. These factors make NH3 systems more capital-intensive than natural gas plants, though the carbon-free operation justifies the investment for decarbonization.

**引用 2**:

## Question 4

### 问题

Describe the mechanisms of NOx formation during ammonia combustion, differentiating between thermal, prompt, and fuel NOx pathways. How do these mechanisms differ from hydrocarbon combustion?

### 标准答案

In NH3 combustion, three NOx formation pathways exist: 1) Thermal NOx: Forms via the Zeldovich mechanism (N2 + O → NO + N) at T>1800 K, but is less significant in NH3 combustion due to typically lower temperatures. 2) Prompt NOx: Forms via CH + N2 → NCN + H in hydrocarbon flames, but is negligible in NH3 flames due to absence of hydrocarbon radicals. 3) Fuel NOx: Dominant pathway where NH3's fuel-bound nitrogen (82% by weight) oxidizes via NH2 → HNO → NO. Key reactions include NH + O2 → NO + OH and NH + NO → N2O + H. Unlike hydrocarbon combustion where thermal NOx dominates at high temperatures, NH3 combustion primarily produces fuel NOx through NHx radicals. The absence of carbon in NH3 eliminates the prompt pathway, while the high nitrogen content makes fuel NOx the major concern. This necessitates different control strategies, such as operating under slightly rich conditions where NH3 acts as a NOx reductant (4NO + 4NH3 + O2 → 4N2 + 6H2O).

### 原文引用

**引用 1**:
> Fuel NOx refers to the oxidation of fuel-bound nitrogen [279]. While the reaction chemistry is highly complex, NH3 combustion produces fuel NOx primarily via HNO (itself produced from NH2) and, to a lesser extent, via H, NO2, OH, and NH.

**引用 2**:
> Thermal NOx proceeds via the well-established Zeldovich mechanism with oxidation of atmospheric N2 [274]. The mechanism takes place at elevated temperatures (>1800 K) [275–277] due to the high activation energy required to break the N2 triple bond.

## Question 5

### 问题

Analyze the heat transfer considerations in designing a fluidized-bed ammonia combustor for steam generation. How does the presence of bed material affect the heat transfer coefficients compared to conventional boilers?

### 标准答案

Fluidized-bed NH3 combustors exhibit superior heat transfer characteristics compared to conventional boilers due to: 1) High particle convection: The bed material's motion creates particle-renewal at heat exchanger surfaces, with typical heat transfer coefficients of 200-500 W/m²K versus 50-100 W/m²K in pulverized coal boilers. 2) Enhanced gas convection: Turbulent gas flow around particles increases convective heat transfer. 3) Radiation: The dense particulate bed provides significant radiative heat transfer. The heat transfer coefficient (h) in fluidized beds follows: h = hpc + hgc + hr, where particle convection (hpc) dominates and scales with (ρp·cp·dp·U)0.5. Design challenges include: a) Erosion of tubes by bed material, requiring erosion-resistant alloys or ceramic coatings, b) Maintaining optimal bed temperature (1000-1300 K) for both combustion stability and heat transfer, c) Arranging tubes to maximize heat transfer while minimizing pressure drop. The bed material's thermal conductivity (e.g., 0.05 W/mK for quartz) affects heat penetration depth, requiring careful selection of particle size (typically 100-500 μm) to balance heat transfer and fluidization quality.
