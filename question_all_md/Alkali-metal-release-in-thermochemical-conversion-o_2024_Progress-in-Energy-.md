## Question 1

### 问题

Explain the chemical mechanisms of potassium release during biomass devolatilization and char combustion stages based on optical measurements, and how chlorine content affects these pathways.

### 标准答案

During biomass devolatilization, potassium is primarily released through two pathways: (1) direct decomposition of organic potassium compounds (P1 in Fig. 37), and (2) evaporation of inorganic KCl (P3). The release rate follows first-order kinetics: d[K]/dt = A_k*exp(-E_k/RT), where A_k is the pre-exponential factor (~2.2×10^13 s^-1) and E_k is activation energy (~170 kJ/mol) [Table 8]. During char combustion, potassium bound to char matrix (Char-K) undergoes oxidation-reduction cycles, releasing atomic K through Char-K→CK→K pathway (P6). Chlorine promotes KCl formation via K + HCl ↔ KCl + H, increasing potassium volatility. Optical measurements show straw (high Cl) releases 10 ppm KCl at 850°C versus wood's dominant KOH release [Fig. 38]. The sulfation reaction KCl + SO2 + H2O ↔ K2SO4 + HCl becomes significant above 1100°C, reducing gaseous KCl [Fig. 17].

## Question 2

### 问题

Derive the Beer-Lambert law for photofragmentation TDLAS (PF-TDLAS) measurements of KOH and KCl, considering optical thickness effects at high alkali concentrations.

### 标准答案

For PF-TDLAS, the concentration of alkali compounds (X_KCl) is derived from the maximum absorbance of fragment K atoms (α_Lmax) using: X_KCl = (-ln(1-α_Lmax)) * (A_f/(E*hc/γλ_f)) * (1/σ_K) * (kT/p) * (1/σ_KClL) [Eq.3]. Here, A_f is the cross-section area (m^2), E is laser energy (J), γ is photofragmentation efficiency (~0.5 for KCl at 266 nm), σ_K is K atom absorption cross-section (2.9×10^-13 cm^2 at 769.9 nm), and σ_KCl is KCl UV cross-section (1.8×10^-17 cm^2 at 246 nm). For optically thick conditions (α_Lmax > 2), the absorption profile truncates [Fig.10], requiring wing fitting with Voigt profiles. The pathlength L must account for plasma geometry, typically 10-100 mm in practical systems. Pressure broadening at industrial conditions (∼10 bar) increases FWHM from 0.19 to 0.26 cm^-1, necessitating pressure-dependent σ_K corrections.

## Question 3

### 问题

Analyze how oxy-fuel combustion (O2/CO2) versus air-fuel combustion (O2/N2) affects sodium release kinetics in coal combustion based on LIBS measurements.

### 标准答案

Oxy-fuel combustion alters sodium release kinetics through three mechanisms: (1) Reduced N2 dilution increases gas-phase [O2] by 3-4x, accelerating char oxidation and sodium release (E_Na = 214 kJ/mol) [Eq.13]. LIBS shows 30% higher Na flux during char burnout at 30% O2 vs air [Fig.42]. (2) Higher CO2 concentrations (40-50% vs <15% in air) inhibit oxidation via endothermic gasification (C + CO2 ↔ 2CO, ΔH=+172 kJ/mol), delaying sodium release. The ash-stage duration increases by 20-40% [Fig.43]. (3) Elevated H2O (10-20% vs <5% in air) promotes NaOH formation via Na2O + H2O ↔ 2NaOH. Optical measurements show NaOH becomes dominant above 1400K with σ_NaOH=1.26×10^-17 cm^2 at 327.3 nm [Fig.16]. The net effect is a tradeoff: O2 enrichment increases release rates while CO2/H2O promotes condensation, requiring TDLAS monitoring of [Na]/[NaOH] ratios for optimal control.

## Question 4

### 问题

Calculate the residence time required for 90% sulfation of KCl to K2SO4 in a 1400K flue gas containing 20 ppm KCl and 500 ppm SO2, using optical measurement data.

### 标准答案

From UV absorption measurements [Fig.17], the sulfation rate follows pseudo-first-order kinetics: d[KCl]/dt = -k_sulf[KCl][SO2], where k_sulf = 1.2×10^8 exp(-12000/T) cm^3/mol-s. At 1400K: k_sulf = 1.2×10^8 exp(-12000/1400) = 347 cm^3/mol-s. For 90% conversion (ln(0.1) = -2.303): τ_90% = 2.303/(k_sulf[SO2]) = 2.303/(347 cm^3/mol-s × 500×10^-6 mol/cm^3) = 13.3 s. This matches TDLAS observations where [KCl] dropped from 15 to 1.5 ppm over ∼15s at 1400K [Fig.17]. The actual residence time must exceed this value, considering: (1) boundary layer diffusion (Sh~2 for d_p=100μm particles), (2) H2O availability (KCl + SO2 + H2O ↔ K2SO4 + 2HCl), and (3) competitive KOH formation (KCl + H2O ↔ KOH + HCl, k_OH=5×10^11 exp(-8000/T) cm^3/mol-s). CFD simulations should incorporate these multistep kinetics using EDC models with Damköhler number Da=τ_flow/τ_chem.

## Question 5

### 问题

Compare the advantages and limitations of LIF, LIBS, and TDLAS for in-situ alkali monitoring in industrial boilers, citing specific detection limits and spatial resolutions.

### 标准答案

TDLAS offers superior quantification (detection limit: 1 ppb K at 769.9 nm) with 0.1s temporal resolution [Fig.54], but requires optical access and suffers opacity at >20 ppm [Fig.10]. LIBS provides elemental detection (DL: 29ppb Na, 72ppb K) with phase-discrimination via laser energy control (10mJ for gas, 100mJ for particles), but lacks species specificity and has poor SNR in turbulent flows. LIF achieves 2D imaging (50μm resolution via PLIF [Fig.25]) with species selectivity (KOH vs KCl via 266nm/320nm photolysis), but requires quenching corrections (Q≈4×10^10 s^-1 for K*). For industrial applications: (1) PF-TDLAS combines photofragmentation (266nm) with TDLAS (769.9nm) to measure KOH/KCl simultaneously (DL: 9/16ppb) [Fig.55]; (2) M-LIBS extends dynamic range to 200ppm using wing detection [Fig.32]; (3) Chemiluminescence (FOAM system) offers robust monitoring (DL: 380ppt Na) without lasers, but loses speciation capability. Optimal deployment combines TDLAS for flue gas monitoring with LIBS for deposit analysis.
