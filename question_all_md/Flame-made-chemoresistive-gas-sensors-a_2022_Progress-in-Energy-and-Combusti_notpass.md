## Question 1

### 问题

In flame spray pyrolysis (FSP), the interplay between coagulation and coalescence (sintering) determines the primary particle diameter (d_p) and aggregate morphology. Using the data for FSP-made CuO crystal size (d_XRD) as a function of precursor flow rate (P) and dispersion O2 flow rate (D) in Fig. 9, explain how process variables (P, D) affect the high-temperature particle residence time (HTPRT) and hence d_p. How can CFD simulations of FSP [89] be used to predict d_p and how does this control benefit gas sensor performance?

### 标准答案

In FSP, the precursor solution is sprayed, droplets evaporate, and vapor undergoes gas-to-particle conversion: nucleation, coagulation, coalescence. The characteristic times are τ_c (coagulation) and τ_s (sintering). When τ_s << τ_c, compact particles form; when τ_s ≈ τ_c, aggregates form; when τ_s >> τ_c, agglomerates form [81]. For CuO in Fig. 9, increasing P at constant D increases d_XRD (triangles), attributed to higher precursor concentration and longer HTPRT. HTPRT ∝ (Flame length) / (Gas velocity). Increasing D at constant P decreases d_XRD due to shorter HTPRT. Quantitatively, the aerosol number concentration n ∝ P, and τ_c ∝ 1/n. Also, higher P increases the flame temperature due to more fuel (solvent combustion). CFD simulations solve the conservation equations for mass, momentum, energy, and species, coupled with population balances for particle size and surface area. The primary particle diameter d_p ∝ (HTPRT)^(1/2) for diffusion-limited coalescence. Specifically, the self-preserving size distribution theory [82] applies. The surface growth rate, if significant, also affects d_p. For sensing, aggregates with neck diameters ≤ 2λ_D (Fig. 3c) yield high response. For instance, FWD SnO2 sensors with small aggregates from size-selected particles showed order of magnitude higher response than polydisperse agglomerates [92]. Thus, by controlling P and D, one can tailor d_p. For example, to achieve high ethanol sensitivity (Fig. 4a), d_p should be < 2λ_D. In FSP, d_p can be related to process variables through aerosol dynamics: d_p ∝ (PSC * P / D)^(1/3) approximately, assuming constant flame temperature. This control is crucial for optimizing the depletion layer geometry. CFD models incorporating droplet evaporation, combustion chemistry, and particle dynamics [89] enable predictive design. This ensures the sensing film has optimal porosity and neck sizes, facilitating rapid analyte diffusion and high surface area interaction, leading to fast response/recovery times and high 3S.
