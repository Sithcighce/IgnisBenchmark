    "question_text": "Based on the provided paper content, explain the fundamental differences between active and passive regeneration in particulate filters, focusing on the operational requirements and oxidant species involved in each strategy. How do these regeneration approaches differ in their implementation and thermal management requirements?",
    "standard_answer": "Active and passive regeneration represent fundamentally different operational approaches for particulate filter regeneration. Active regeneration requires temporary changes to the filter's operating conditions to increase temperature and promote particle oxidation. As stated in the paper: 'Active regeneration describes regeneration strategies that require a temporary change in the operating condition of the filter. Typical active regeneration increases the filter temperature to promote the oxidation of trapped particles, usually with O₂ as the oxidant.' This approach typically employs methods such as post-fuel injection, electric heaters, or microwaves to provide additional thermal energy. In contrast, passive regeneration occurs spontaneously under favorable operating conditions without active control. The paper explains: 'Passive regeneration usually relies on NO₂ as the oxidant, since it is a stronger oxidising agent than O₂ which allows particle combustion to occur at a lower temperature.' This strategy requires an upstream oxidation catalyst to convert engine-out NO to NO₂ since engine-out NO₂ concentration is insufficient. The thermal management differs significantly between these approaches - active regeneration requires deliberate temperature elevation through external energy input, while passive regeneration leverages the inherent chemical properties of NO₂ to enable oxidation at lower exhaust temperatures during normal operation.",

    "question_text": "Based on the provided paper content, describe the evolution of pressure drop across a particulate filter during loading and explain the mathematical relationship for pressure drop across the filter wall, including how particle deposition affects permeability.",
    "standard_answer": "The pressure drop across a particulate filter increases during loading due to particle deposition within the filter wall, which reduces the wall permeability. The general pressure drop equation for the filter wall is ΔP = (μw/κ)v + βρ_gwv², where ΔP is the pressure drop, μ is the dynamic viscosity, w is the wall thickness, κ is the permeability of the porous wall, v is the gas velocity, ρ_g is the gas density, and β is the Forchheimer coefficient. The first term represents viscous losses, and the second term accounts for inertial losses. As particles deposit within the filter wall, the permeability κ decreases, leading to an increase in pressure drop. This is supported by the paper's statement: 'As particles deposit within the filter wall, its permeability (κ in Eq. (41)) will reduce and hence lead to an increase in pressure drop.' The Forchheimer coefficient β can be derived from Ergun's equation as β = (1.75/d_c)((1-ε)/ε³), where d_c is the collector diameter and ε is the porosity. However, inertial losses are often neglected in filter models due to low wall Reynolds numbers. The pressure drop evolution is directly linked to the reduction in wall permeability caused by in-wall particle deposition during the deep bed filtration stage.",
