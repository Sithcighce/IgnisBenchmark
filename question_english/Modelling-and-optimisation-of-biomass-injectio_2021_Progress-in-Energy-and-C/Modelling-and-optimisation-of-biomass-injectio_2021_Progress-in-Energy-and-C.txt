Biomass is a renewable and potentially carbon-neutral energy source and can be a promising alternative to fossil 
fuels  in  the  ironmaking  industry.  Pulverised  biomass  injection  (PBI)  is  the  most  promising  technology  to  use 
biomass-based materials in ironmaking blast furnaces (BFs). This paper reviews key aspects of recent research 
relating to biomass combustion in the raceway region: experimental studies, numerical studies, and the appli-
cation of the research findings to optimise BF practice. In the experimental part, the pretreatment of raw biomass 
to  produce  pyrolysed  biochar  products  for  improving  applicability  in  BFs  is  reviewed.  The  properties  of  raw 
biomass and biochar are compared with the main requirements for injection into BFs, and the process tests that 
have been employed at lab- and pilot-scales are reviewed. In the modelling part, a comprehensive overview of 
mathematical modelling of biomass combustion in BFs is presented, ranging from turbulent flow to heat transfer 
and mass transfer, as well as key reaction models for simulating the lower part of the BF. With respect to the 
application of the research, in-furnace phenomena understanding, operation optimisation, and facility design are 
reviewed, including the co-firing of biomass and coal. In addition, heat and mass balance modelling has been 
used  to  demonstrate  the  operating  window  of  feasible  operations  using  PBI.  Life  cycle  assessment  has  been 
reviewed to demonstrate PBI’s environmental credentials. Based on the aspects reviewed, conclusions have been 
drawn on the strengths, limitations, and outlook of PBI studies. This paper offers a comprehensive review of the 
combustion of biomass in BFs and should prove useful for process understanding, design and optimisation to-
wards green ironmaking technology.   

Introduction 

Biomass is a renewable and sustainable fuel [1]. It can also often be 
treated as a carbon-neutral fuel over its life cycle, as the CO2  emitted 
through  the  combustion  of  the  biomass  can  be  balanced  by  the  CO2 
captured from the atmosphere for the growth of trees, with little or no 
time lag [2]. Thus, biomass is regarded as one of the most promising 
alternative  energy  resources  for  emission-intensive  industrial  produc-
tion.  At  present, among  the many  existing renewable  energy options, 
biomass  conversion  already  accounts  for  over  70%  of  all  renewable 
energy production and up to 10% of the world’s total energy supply [3]. 
Biomass  combustion  for  electrical  power  production  is  one  of  the 
most commercialised options for its industrial utilisation. [4–6] How-
ever, there remain many challenges, ranging from financing to energy 
conversion  and  efficiency  to  government  policies,  which  leave  uti-
lisation still in the very early stage in many countries. Its low calorific 
value  (CV)  makes  biomass  a  less  than  perfect  substitute  for  coal  or 
natural  gas  (NG).  The  ironmaking  industry  [6,7]  is  another  potential 

market,  where  biomass  not  only  provides  renewable  heat  energy  for 
emissions reduction but can also be a significant carbon source of the 
reducing agent for iron ore [8–10]. 

The  ironmaking  industry  is  currently  under  pressure  to  reduce 
emissions from fossil fuel consumption (e.g., coal, coke, and NG) [11,12] 
and  it  is  difficult  to  achieve  CO2  reduction  targets  using  the  existing 
technologies and equipment (Fig. 1) [13–15]. Moreover, the scale of the 
ironmaking industry is huge, ~1.7 Gt in 2020 and is predicted to in-
crease to 2.1Gt in 2035 [16], and thus it can potentially accommodate a 
considerable amount of biomass. 

In fact, the World Steel Association set up a worldwide collaboration 
on CO2 reduction in 2005-2012, namely, CO2 Breakthrough Programme 
[17],  connecting  with  a  wide  range  of  initiatives  and  companies 
including EU’s ULCOS program [18], Japan’s COURSE50 [19], POSCO 
in South Korea [20], AISI in the USA [20], CANMET in Canada [21], 
Australian CO2 Breakthrough Program [2] and activities in Brazil [22]. 
Biomass  is  the  main concept  in  the  programs of  Australia and  Brazil. 
Biomass utilisation has long been regarded as an effective technology to 
mitigate  the  ironmaking  industry’s  carbon  footprint,  especially  in

process is being developed and adopted. Biomass has the potential to 
decrease net emissions by 50% or more. [2] 

Ironmaking is carried out using both the blast furnace (BF) and non- 
BF routes. The BF is the dominant route, the principal emitter and ac-
counts for ~70% of world crude steel production [26][200][231]. As 
shown in Fig. 2, biomass can be applied to both the BF and some of the 
non-BF routes, including the use of biomass, or biomass-derived chars, 
for pulverised biomass/biochar injection at the tuyeres (PBI [27], which 
was also reported as bio-PCI [28], CPI (Charcoal Powder Injection) [27], 
PCH (Pulverized Charcoal) [29], etc.), biomass-derived coke (Bio-coking 
[30,31]),  biomass  in  iron  ore  sintering  for  charging  into  BFs  (Bio--
sintering [32,33]), iron ore-biomass pellets [34] and Bio-gas reductant 
[35]. Also, there are some other options such as BF lump charcoal charge 
(partial),  BF  nut  coke  replacement  (full),  BF  carbon/ore  composites 
(unreduced), and BF pre-reduced feed (~10%), etc. 

Among the potential options in BF route (Fig. 2(b)), bio-coke (option 
2) suffers from low bulk density and mechanical strength of cold or after 
the reaction due to the significant porous structure of biomass [36]. The 
substitution of charcoal for coal would only be around 10%. To ensure 
the  quality  of  good  coke  can  be  made,  bio-coke  with  the  addition  of 
charcoal  was  an  option.  It  was  found  that  an  addition  of  7.5  wt% 
charcoal in bio-coke significantly increased the coke reactivity with CO2, 
and  did  not  deteriorate  the  coke  resistance  to  strength  degradation 
under the thermal load of BF, however, caused degradation by gasifi-
cation as demonstrated by more reduction in the tensile strength of the 
bio-coke  [30].  Bio-coke  is  proved  to  be  feasible  in  many  small 
all-charcoal Brazil BFs (60-700 m3) [37], while it is yet to be applied to 
large  BFs  because  the  strength  of  lump  charcoal  is  not  sufficient  to 
support the burden [38]. 

As  for  option  3,  the  yield  and  tumble  index  of  the  bio-sintering 
cannot  meet  the  standard  of  BF  practice  to  date,  regardless  of  the 
amount and type of biomass added [38]. The good news is that indices 
have been found to be satisfactory when bio-sinter with an addition of 
low  volatile  matter  (VM)  charcoal  and  dense,  low  VM  charcoal  with 
reducibility  index  of  71.8-74.5,  reduction  disintegration  index  of 
29.7-31.0 and tumble index of 69.1-65.6 [33]. 

The practicality of supply is a major limitation for the utilisation of 
biomass  in  large,  modern  BFs.  It  has  been  reported  that  1,700  m2  of 
plantation  eucalyptus  forest  is  required  to  produce  1  t  of  charcoal, 
assuming  7  years  for  growth.  If  charcoal  supplied  all  carbon  re-
quirements for a BF producing 10 kt-HM/day, 25,500 km2 of plantations 
would be required [39]. 

PBI  (Option  1)  does  not  require  the  mechanical  strength  of  pulv-
erised injectant, and the biomass-based fuel, e.g., charcoal, has the po-
tential  to  fully  replace  coal  [40–43].  Also,  adopting  PBI  requires 
minimal modification of existing BF facilities, thereby may avoid major 
capital investments [44]. From the 1990s, Brazil started to use charcoal 
for tuyere injection; in 2006, PBI accounted for about one-third of the 
total hot metal (HM) production in Brazil; and now the injection rates of 
fine  charcoal  have  reached  100  to  150  kg-charcoal/ton-HM  [22]. 
Clearly,  PBI has  the  greatest  technology  readiness for  biomass  imple-
mentation to mitigate CO2  emissions in the ironmaking industry. Note 
that in this review, biomass is a general concept, including raw biomass 
and biomass-based fuel (e.g., biochar, biogas). 

PBI is generally similar to pulverised coal injection (PCI), but there

countries where land and rainfall are available for extensive sustainable 
plantation forestry. There is a remarkable history of the production of 
pig iron using charcoal in Brazil and approximately 10 Mt/y is produced 
currently  [23].  Recent  research  programs  have  been  conducted  in 
Canada  [21],  Australia  (Australian  CO2  Breakthrough  Program  [2], 
Germany  [24],  and  research  has  been  continuous  in  Brazil  for  many 
years [25]. Perhaps with the exception of Brazil, where industrial-scale 
charcoal  utilisation  already  exists  (10  Mt/y),  the  use  of  biomass  is 
currently being proposed as a transitional technology for the reduction 
of net CO2 emissions from existing ironmaking facilities over the next 30 
–  40  years,  while  new  near-net-zero  emissions  iron  and  steelmaking

are some specific concerns and requirements for biomass properties so as 
to sustain efficient BF practice[225–228]. A comprehensive review of 
BF-PCI technology can be found in Ref. [45]. In typical PCI operations, 
PC  is  pneumatically  carried  with  conveying  gas  (typically  air  or 
high-pressure N2 at room temperature) and injected via coal lances into 
the  raceway  via  the  tuyeres  (Fig.  3).  Subsequently,  the  particles  and 
◦
conveying gas commence mixing with the blast (>1,000
C (1,273K)) in 
the blowpipe and tuyere; and the combustion takes place in the raceway 
within an extremely short time[223,224]. The combusting fuel particles 
will either recirculate within the raceway or flow into the surrounding 
coke bed under the effect of their momentum. In addition to the pulv-
erised fuel (PF) particles, there are also small coke particles circulating 
within the raceway as a result of the momentum interaction between the 
blast and coke bed[201,203,208,214]. 

Biomass  combustion  within  the  BF  raceway  involves  some  unique 
and  complex  phenomena,  compared  with  biomass  combustion  in  PF 
boilers,  e.g.,  used  for  electricity  generation.  As  shown  in  Table  1, 

◦

combustion  in  the  raceway  occurs  at  higher  temperatures  (1,400- 
C (1,673-2,473K)), higher pressures (about 450 kPa), higher ve-
2,200
locities (200-300 m/s), and much shorter residence times (10-40 ms). 
Such differences mean that the findings from pulverised coal/biomass 
combustion studies for other combustors cannot be directly transferred 
to BF raceway combustion. 

Differences between physical and chemical material properties and 
thermochemical behaviours of biomass and coal are also important. If 
biomass is injected to replace PC, it is expected to play a similar role and 
bear  similar  properties.  However,  biomass  properties  can  be  very 
different  from  coal,  and  they  will  directly  affect  the  heat  and  mass 
transfer  mechanisms,  the  temperature  distribution  and  the  gas  distri-
bution from the raceway to the BF shaft [2,6]. Still, the PBI substitute 
should meet certain of the basic requirements such as the composition, 
combustibility,  reactivity,  grindability,  and  fluidisation  properties,  as 
well as having suitably low ash and compatible ash composition. Very 
importantly,  it  is  also  necessary  to  understand  the  specific  in-furnace 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience87(2021)1009524Y. Liu and Y. Shen                                                                                                                                                                                                                             

materials to be used effectively in BFs. This will include the pretreatment 
of  raw  biomass,  the  properties  of  biomass-derived  chars,  and  process 
tests that have been used at different scales of simulation (e.g., bench, 
pilot).  In  Section  3,  numerical  studies  of  PBI  have  been  reviewed  in 
detail, including sub-models of turbulent flow, heat/mass transfer and 
key  reaction  models.  Recommendations  have  been  made  for  future 
work. In Section 4, studies of how PBI has been applied and optimised 
have  been  reviewed,  including  in-furnace  phenomena  understanding, 
operational  design,  operating  facility  configurations,  and  co-firing  of 
biomass/coal.  This  section  also  includes  how  PBI  operations  can  be 
assessed using energy/mass balance models, techno-economic analysis 
and  life  cycle  assessment.  Lastly,  the  limitations  and  outlook  of  PBI 
studies have been drawn together and discussed. 

Experimental studies 

Various experimental studies have been reported for evaluating the 
feasibility  and  optimisation  of  PBI.  The  studies  include  biomass  pre-
treatment,  evaluation  of  biomass  properties  and  process  tests  under 
simulated injection conditions (Fig. 4). 

Pretreatment of raw biomass 

The pretreatment of biomass-derived  materials, especially thermal 
pretreatment,  is  normally  required  to  improve  product  properties  for 
optimised utilisation in ironmaking BFs. A detailed review of pretreat-
ment of biomass materials can be found in Ref. [47]. 

It is well known that the many types of biomass have a wide variety 
of sources and significantly different properties. Major potential sources 
are the forest industry, agriculture, municipal solid waste, and peat [12]. 
The  evolution  of  biomass  fuels  could  be  roughly  classified  into  food 
crops, inedible lignocellulosic biomass, algal and genetically engineered 
algal  and  microbial  systems.[48]  The  main  elements  in  biomass  are 
carbon and hydrogen, and the main components are usually cellulose 
[C6(H2O)5]n,  hemicellulose  [C5(H2O)4]n,  lignin  [C10H12O3]n,  extrac-
tives, and ash [49]. 

Compared  with  coal,  raw  biomass  has  inadequate  properties  for 
direct injection into BFs [50]. It normally has low energy density, high 
moisture  content  [51],  high-oxygen  content,  low-CV  and  poor  grind-
ability  [52].  Pretreatment  can  modify  biomass  properties  to  achieve 
high efficiency and productivity BF practice.

phenomena related to PBI. On this basis, many experimental and nu-
merical studies have been conducted to simulate PBI operation. 

The purpose of this review is to draw together recent research ac-
tivities  concerning  PBI  from  the  three  major  areas:  experimental, 
modelling  and  application  studies.  In  Section  2,  experimental  studies 
have been reviewed to assess the applicability of each approach and to 
document the physical and chemical properties necessary for biomass

Thermal  pretreatment  is  the  conventional  and  commercialised 
method to upgrade biomass for ironmaking, including torrefaction (inert 
environment), carbonisation to produce charcoal (inert environment), 
and  gasification  (air/O2/CO2/steam)  [53].  Regarding  inert  thermal 
pretreatments,  torrefaction  is  operated  at  temperatures  of  200-300
C 
(473-573K) [54–56], and carbonisation is operated at temperatures of 
C  (573-773K)  [57–59].  Gasification  temperatures  would  be

modelling) and Section 4 (heat and mass balance (HMB) constraints and 
CO2 emissions reduction).

Many types of biomass and their derivatives have been studied for 
PBI  in  terms  of  physicochemical  properties  and  chemical  mechanism 
research.  The  main  reaction  in  inert  thermal  pretreatment  (thermal 
decomposition in the absence of oxygen) is devolatilisation. As a result 
(Fig. 6), the carbon mass fraction relative to the content of hydrogen and 
oxygen increases [60]; and the CV of biomass has been found to increase 
by  about  9-12%  [61,62].  Although  the  ash  content  increases  propor-
tionally, if the biomass is free of contaminants, the ash content remains 
lower than that of coals currently used for PCI. Retort tests for the slow 
heating of dry wood usually find that organic compounds tar is the first

based on the molar ratio on O/C and H/C, where A-ref is typical PCI coal 
in use. The points fall roughly into four groups: (1) coal and carbonised 
biomass, (2) torrefied biomass, and (3) raw biomass. Raw biomass ma-
terials  exhibit  high  H/C  and  very  high  O/C  ratios.  Torrefied  biomass 
materials  have  chemical  compositions  that  are  intermediate  between 
raw  biomass  and  coal/charcoal.  As  will  be  demonstrated  in  Section 
4.2.4, various types of charcoal produced from wood provide the best 
replacement for PC in terms of the HMB constraints required for prac-
tical BF practice. Worldwide, rice husks and  derivates are the second 
most abundant type of biomass to be considered for PBI studies. How-
ever, rice husks and other forms of raw biomass will increase coke usage 
in the BF and, therefore, will not efficiently decrease CO2 emissions. The 
Hardgrove Grindability Index (HGI) is an important criterion for PF and 
can potentially be improved by thermal pretreatment of raw biomass. At 
the same time, thermal pretreatment decreases the yield due to the loss 
of VM and pyrolysis products (mainly carbon and hydrogen) [50]. Such 
yield loss is balanced by the increase in CV and carbon content of the 
char.  In  general,  thermal  pretreatment  produces  favourable  improve-
ment for the energy-intensive and carbon-intensive PBI. 

The mechanism of inert thermal pretreatment of biomass has been 
simplified as a one-step global mechanism (Eq. 1 or Eq. 2). On this basis, 
a  modified  one-step  multi-reaction  mechanism  has  been  proposed,  as 
shown in Eq. 3. Furthermore, a multi-step mechanism has been devel-
oped (Eq. 4 and Eq. 5). More advanced mechanisms can be found in Refs. 
[47,63]. For example, Fig. 8 shows XRD results for biomass chars pre-
pared  at  different  pyrolysis  temperatures.  [64]  As  the  pyrolysis  tem-
perature rises, the carbon structure becomes more organised, and the 
crystallite size grows. The weak links between the aliphatic side chains 
and  the  carbon  crystallites  can  be  disrupted  when  the  pyrolysis  tem-
perature  is  quite  high,  while  the  graphitization  degree  of  biochar  in-
creases.  The  volatile  side  chains  of  aliphatic  side  chains  are  then 
released.

Evaluation of biomass properties for PBI 

The chemical composition and CV of biomass are crucial properties

Ref.  [50]),  and  thermochemical  stages  in  biomass  pyrolysis  (thermal  decom-
position in the absence of oxygen, adapted from Ref. [26]). Note that stage A 
refers to that wood absorbs heat and progressively loses moisture to “bone-dry” 
state; stage B refers to that endothermic decomposition commences, with the 
release of CO, CO2, acetic acid and methanol; stage C refers to that continued 
exothermic decomposition, with release of CO, CO2, CH4  and H2  gases, acetic 
acid, methanol and higher-chained hydrocarbons and tars; stage D refers to that 
VM content and yield of the charcoal ↓ fixed carbon content ↑ and exothermic 
reactions ↓.

that chars produced from 300

duce CO, CO2, hydrocarbons and tars on further heating, e.g., injection 
[26].

for successful PBI; however, there are several other criteria that need to 
be satisfied during the selection process. i) Combustion characteristics; 
ii)  Carbon  gasification  reactivity;  iii)  Grinding  characteristics  and 

fluidisation properties; iv) Softening and melting characteristics of the 
ash. 

As  previously  discussed,  Table  1  indicates  that  the  conditions  for 
combustion of PFs in the BF raceway are distinctly different from those 
found in other major industrial applications, e.g., PF boilers. It would be 
expensive and difficult to build and carry out biomass evaluation tests 
using  pilot-scale  reactors  that  could  faithfully  simulate  the  tempera-
tures, pressures and gas flow found in the raceway. Thus, the approach 
has been to adopt or develop simpler tests, as will be described below. 
Such  tests  are  valuable,  but  the  results  need  to  be  considered  to  be 
indicative rather than definitive, i.e., capable of ranking injectant can-
didates, rather than predicting absolute burnout levels. It is hoped that 
mathematical models will be successful in bridging the gap between test 
and BF conditions. 

Combustibility 

High combustibility is essential for any fuel used for tuyere injection 
as the gas-solid flow is very fast, and the residence time in the raceway is 
extremely  short  of  achieving  complete  burnout.  In  the  raceway,  the 
main reactions of biomass particles are devolatilisation and char com-
bustion, which can be written as Eq. 6 and Eq. 7. 

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is a widely used method for the 
evaluation  of  PFs  and  has  the  advantages  of  being  a  fast  and  simple 
experimental process that produces rich experimental data. The samples 
are typically small (~10 mg) but consist of a large number of particles in 
close  proximity,  rather  than  dispersed  in  a  gas  plume.  The  mass  loss 
curve  with  time/temperature  provides  the  ignition  temperature, 
burnout temperature, and the peak reaction temperature under a slow 
heating regime. The maximum reaction rate and kinetic parameters of 
the sample can be obtained through the Derivative Thermogravimetry 
(DTG) curve.

The TGA results of some types of raw biomass, biochar and PCI coals 
are collected and compared in Table 4. This indicates that biomass and 
biochar show relatively better combustibility than PCI coals under TGA 
test conditions. The biomass and biochar samples start to decompose, 
reach the maximum rate of combustion, and burn out at relatively lower 
temperatures than PCI coals, i.e., all the ignition (Ti), peak temperatures 
(Tm, temperature of the maximum weight loss rate [72]) and burnout 
temperatures (Tb, temperature corresponding the DTG value zero again 
[73]) of biomass and biochar are lower than for PCI coals. 

This superior performance has also been found in the TGA profiles of 
blends of charcoal and coal [68]. Biochar and PCI coals have one tem-
perature corresponding to the peak rate while biomass usually has two 
peaks,  indicating  combustion  has  relatively  separate  sub-processes  of 
devolatilisation and char combustion; thus, it is necessary to consider 
two  separate  sub-processes  in  kinetic  calculations  and  computer 

modelling. 

TGA curves can be further analysed by model fitting to characterise 
the  combustion  kinetics  [74–78][232].  Generally,  biochar  has  shown 
better kinetic parameters than PCI coals. In one study, it was found that 
charcoal  combusted  35%  faster  than  char  from  coal  [79].  This  was 
related to the biochar having less crystalline structural order, a lower 
degree of graphitisation, and a more well-developed pore structure [24, 
27,64].  The  alkali  metal  compounds  in  biomass  mineral  matter,  the 
main content of biomass ash after combustion, also have been reported 
to be combustion catalysts [80], but notably, alkali metal compounds 
are  also  harmful  to  BF  facilities  and  their  loads  in  raw  materials  are 
normally limited by operators. 

To sum up, from the view of the combustibility as estimated by TGA, 

biomass and biochar are suitable for BF tuyere injection.

Gasification reactivity

(7)  

The char generated from biomass is expected to be highly reactive 
with CO2, thereby generating reducing gas for iron ore reduction[[22] 
[82,83]]. The Boudouard reaction (or solution loss reaction) is shown in 
Eq. 8. The techniques to investigate gasification reactivity are the same 
as  the  combustibility  but  within  the  different  gas  environments,  i.e., 
composition  and  temperature.  In  general,  biomass  and  biochar  are 
found to have greater reactivity with CO2 than PCI coals. The activation 
energy of biochar is in the range of 130-160 kJ/mol, while that of coals 
is usually higher than 190 kJ/mol [22,84,85]. 

Char + CO2→2CO

(8) 

Currently, there are two common ways of determining the gasifica-
tion reactivity of PCI fuels. The first method obtains char from biomass 
in an inert gas environment and then tests the conversion of that char in 
a CO2 environment, with the temperature range of 700-1,400K. A result 
of this test is the reactivity index, t0.5 (Eq. 9), which represents the time 
required to reach 50% carbon gasification [86,87]. The second method 
is completed in one step where the reaction gas is switched from an inert 
gas to CO2 at 1,050
C (1,323K) after the removal of the VM, which may 
be closer to the chemical behaviour of biomass within the raceway. The 
reactivity obtained in this test has been expressed as the conversion rate 
(Eq. 10), that is, the percentage of the carbon material that reacts with 
CO2 to generate CO [22,84].

It is still questionable whether these tests with pure CO2 can simulate 
the  raceway.  The  CO2  content  in  the  BF  is  hardly  more  than  50%. 
Although these tests do not closely simulate raceway conditions in O2/ 
CO2 environments at different temperatures, charcoal has been found to 
show  improved  performance  compared  with  PCI  coals  of  similar  VM 
content [85]. This property is most important for any char that leaves 
the raceway leading to fewer problems from unburnt particles that may 
adversely affect the permeability of the BF lower zone. 

Grinding and flow performance 

Biomass grindability, fluidisation and pneumatic transportation are 
connected issues relating to the feasibility of PBI, and used to evaluate 
the  energy  consumption  of  pulverisation  in  biomass  preparation,  the 
difficulty  of PBI and maintenance [22,71,88]. They relate to whether 
different or modified equipment is required for biomass pulverisation, 
and whether separate grinding is required for the co-injection of biomass 
and coal. 

The HGI and the particle size distribution (PSD) are the most used 
indices to represent the grindability of the biomass [89]. A higher HGI 
value means that the sample is easier to grind into powder [53]. The HGI 
of PCI fuel is normally required to be between 50 and 90 [90]. Fuels with 
an HGI below 50 require excessive energy for grinding, while fuels with 
an HGI above 90 (usually strongly caking coal) will cause difficulties 
during grinding and transportation. The PSD of biomass is important in 
understanding its physical and chemical properties, such as ignition and 
flame structure. Several measurement methods are available, including 
sieve analysis, air elutriation analysis, photoanalysis, optical counting 
methods,  electroresistance  counting  methods,  sedimentation  tech-
niques, laser diffraction methods, acoustic spectroscopy, and ultrasound 
attenuation  spectroscopy.  When  examining  PSD  profiles,  the  sample 
with a smaller size that shows the largest proportion in the PSD after 

grinding is considered to be the sample with the better grindability. 

Biochar normally has improved grindability compared with its raw 
biomass  as  a  result  of  the  partial  disruption  of  the  lignocellulosic 
structure  in  the  biomass  during  pyrolysis.  A  decrease  in  energy  con-
sumption of 40-88% has been found compared with the milling of raw 
biomass [52,57,89,91]. 

As shown in Fig. 9, the pyrolysis temperature and residence time are 
key factors to improve the grindability of biomass, that is, a high pre-
treatment temperature or a long residence time benefits the grindability 
of  biochar  [60,92,93].  Note  that  this  study  tested  a  wide  range,  and 
these particles are much larger than the normal specifications of >75% 
passing  74μm.  In  addition,  the  type  and  composition  of  the  biomass 
influence the grindability. For example, higher lignin content leads to 
poorer  grindability  of  torrefied  stump  wood  compared  with  torrefied 
poplar or wood chips [94,95]. Still, the optimal pretreatment tempera-
ture should guarantee the quality of biochar while maintaining the yield. 
More data are required to better understand the grindability of different 
types of biochar, and thus the optimisation of PBI. 

Although charcoal is generally easy to pulverise, it has been found 
that because table mills have a minimum gap, they produce an unex-
pectedly high fraction of lamellar and acicular charcoal particles that 
may  build  up  and  recirculate  in  the  mill,  requiring  attention.  Such 
particles  may  have  uncompromised  combustion  performance  but 
because they have one or two dimensions that exceed the size specifi-
cation, they may be suspect for pneumatic conveying. More research is 
required in this field, but it is understood that the use of pendulum mills 
is preferred in Brazil. 

The flow performance of pulverised biomass includes two aspects: 
flowability and floodability characteristics, that is, flow characteristics 
before and after entering the raceway zone [96]. The former refers to the 
pneumatic  transportation  of  the  pulverised  biomass  particles  in  pipes 
from the grinding mill to the injection lance, and the latter refers to the 
dispersion of the biomass particles within the raceway. 

Good flow performance involves optimising the mixing of conveying 
gas  with  the  particles,  and  designing  for  the  physical,  geometric  and 
flow properties of the particles. The conveying gas flow rate should be 
sufficient  to  ensure  stable  conveyance  of  the  particles,  avoiding  sedi-
mentation and line or lance blockage. It should not be so great that there 
is excessive energy consumption or wear in the conveying lines. Both 
lean-phase conveying with air and dense-phase conveying with nitrogen 
have been successfully used for PBI. 

Within  the  raceway,  under  the  same  external  conditions,  creating 
greater dispersion of the pulverised biomass plume improves access of 
O2 to the particles and leads to a higher burnout. Several flow indicators 
are available for pulverised biomass, including the angle of repose, the 
Hausner ratio, Carr’s flowability index, basic flow energy, the cohesion, 
angle  of  internal  friction,  and  the  flow  index  [97].  It  is  generally 
believed  that  the  smaller the  angle  of  repose,  the  better the  fluidised 
performance  of  the  biomass  particles.  PSD  is  common  as  a  part  of 
biomass evaluation, while the flowability index seldom appears for PBI. 
The  Carr  index  method  [98]  is  a  laboratory  method  that  can  predict 
fluidised performance. This is widely used in coal evaluation while it has 
not been used in evaluating PBI to date. 

Softening and melting characteristics of ash 

In PBI, both high ash content and low ash fusion temperature may 
cause operational problems. Regarding ash content, a general limitation 
for PCI coal is 10wt% [99]. However, the ash content of uncontaminated 
biomass seldom exceeds 2 – 3% which would translate to 6 – 9% in the 
charcoal after pyrolysis, so maximum charcoal ash of around 10wt% is 
also appropriate to minimise the production of slag and the consumption 
of coke and fluxes in the BF. The biochar produced from woody biomass 
with  a  low  content  of  ash  and  sulfur  (Table  2)  is  able  to  reduce  the 
amount of slag, and leading to less operational problem [6,68]. 

With  respect  to  ash  fusion,  the  first  consideration  is  to  avoid  the 
deposition  of  softened/molten  ash  inside  the  lance,  blowpipe,  and 

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience87(2021)10095210Y. Liu and Y. Shen

tuyere. Countermeasures are the use of coaxial lances with a cooling gas 
in the annulus and moving the lance forward toward the tuyere tip. In 
the raceway, ash that becomes molten under high-temperature condi-
tions (>1,273 K) may deposit on and react with the coke lumps. Also, the 
softening and melting of the ash within the particles can hinder gasifi-
cation  by  restricting  gas  from  entering  the  char  [80,100–102].  These 
phenomena may negatively affect BF permeability. 

◦

The ash fusion temperature (AFT) is used to predict the influence of 
ash  on  the  BF  practice,  i.e.,  it  has  been  recommended  that  the  AFT 
should be greater than 1,200
C (1,473K) [103]. AFT testing includes the 
deformation  temperature  (DT),  the  softening  temperature  (ST),  the 
hemispheric temperature (HT) and the flow temperature (FT), as listed 
in Table 5. Importantly, it has been found that the AFTs of biomass or 
biomass/coal blends are less than those of PCI coals [84]. This was re-
ported to be related to the high content of alkali metal compounds in 
biomass mineral matter [104]. The presence of molten alkali metal salts 
with low melting points was reported in some high-temperature studies 
[79,105]. 

Alkali metals (Na and K) form by the reduction in the raceway and 
convert  to  cyanides  and  oxides  higher  in  the  BF.  Alkali  loads  in  raw 
materials must be controlled because concentrations build up in the BF 
process due to recirculation. The associated chemical reactions catalyse 

coke degradation, affecting BF gas distribution and liquid drainage. If 
high alkali loads persist, deposits (scaffolds) may adhere to the BF shaft 
walls. More detailed topics relating to ash fusion behaviour can be found 
in Refs. [106] and [80]. 

To sum up, biomass and biochar have advantages in low ash content 
and disadvantages in low AFTs. An optimum condition can be achieved 
by careful selection of the biomass and/or biochar for PBI. 

Process tests 

The drop tube furnace (DTF) and complex PCI injection test rigs at 
laboratory  or  pilot-scale  are  more  attractive  than  TGA  for  studying 
biomass injection performance because they simulate the BF raceway 
more closely. 

Drop tube furnace 

The DTF was developed to simulate coal combustion in PF boilers, 
and it has also been used to approximate PCI and PBI. As observed in 
Table 1, the DTF produces a high heating rate of 104  K/s and the resi-
dence time is less than 1 second, while TGA provides only 5-50 K/s and 
the  residence  time  is  20-100  minutes.  However,  the  DTF  has  well- 
defined  laminar  flows  while  the  plume  in  the  raceway  is  battered  by 
turbulence. The raceway heats PF particles at 106 K/s and the residence 
time of PF particles is 10 –  40 ms; both two orders of magnitude are 
different from the DTF. Also, in the DTF, particles/conveying gas and the 
hot  blast  are  usually  co-axially  injected  (Fig.  10),  while  in  real  BF 
practice, there is an angle between the lance and the tuyere. The tuyere 
is usually a downward inclined truncated cone, leading the gas/particle 
flow to the higher-pressure side. In addition, the DTF is usually a vertical 
chamber while tuyere injection is almost horizontal, which affects the 
particle dispersion along the particle plume. 

One strength of the DTF is that it eliminates the secondary reactions 
between  the  primary  VM  and  char  particles  that  occur  in  the  small 
packed samples used in TGA [73]. The burnout at the outlet is consid-
ered to be the burnout at the endpoint of the raceway along the tuyere 
centreline, which, because of the much greater residence time, is likely

to overestimate the real burnout and therefore somewhat underestimate 
the  mass  of  unburnt particles  flowing  into  the  surrounding  coke bed. 
Other  strengths  of  the  DTF  are  the  well-controlled  conditions  and 
reproducible results that almost certainly rank combustion performance 
correctly, assisting injectant selection. 

Several definitions of burnout have been used in DTF experiments 
(Table 6). Most of these are equivalent and are based on the measure-
ment  of  ash  content  of  the  product  char  and  the  raw  biomass.  For 
example, Pohlmann et al. [85] used Eq. 11, Chen et al. [53] and He et al. 
[103] used Eq. 12 as burnout, respectively. 

PCI/PBI test rigs 

Purpose-built PCI test rigs are the most comprehensive facilities for 
PBI combustion testing (Fig. 11), i.e., they attempt to simulate many or 
all of the conditions in the BF raceway: high-pressure, high-temperature, 
high-radiation, high turbulence, and short residence time. 

PCI test rigs usually include a blowpipe, an inclined injection lance, 
the tuyere and the centreline zone of the raceway. The axis of the hor-
izontal  combustion  chamber  simulates  the  projected  injectant  plume 
centreline,  the  dimensions  of  the  chamber  allow  for  greater  or  lesser 
particle dispersion. Various ports downstream in the chamber allow for 
particle  sampling  for  burnout  measurement  and  monitoring  for  tem-
perature and gas composition. For example, the burnout calculation (Eq. 
13) was based on the gas composition measurement in Silva et al.’s and 
Assis et al.’s studies [81,108] from REDEMAT, Brazil with the PCI test 
rig (Fig. 11(a)). 

In Machado et al.’s studies [22,84] and Barbieri et al.’s study [68] 
from the collaboration between UFRGS, Brazil and RWTH Aachen, the 
burnout calculation (Eq. 14) was  based on the  change in ash content 
observed in the biomass when used in the PCI test rig (Fig. 11(b)). More 
PCI investigations with this PCI test rig have been done in RWTH Aachen 
[109]  and  in  USTB,  China  [110].  These  two  PCI  test  rigs  are  at  a 
laboratory-scale. 

A pilot-scale PCI test rig (Fig. 11(c)) has been reported in Mathieson 
et al.’s study [27] from Australia. The development of this PCI test rig is 
described in Ref. [111] and it has been used to compare the burnout (Eq. 
15) of four different charcoal types and mixtures with coal under various 
raceway  operating  conditions.  Although  this  rig  operates  at  ambient 
pressure,  it  features  1,200
C  (1,473K)  blast  temperature,  oxygen 
enrichment,  all  normal  lance  configurations,  an  expanding  injectant 
plume, radiation from the pre-heated chamber walls and recirculation of 
gases within the simulated raceway. 

◦

Four definitions of burnout given in Table 6 are solids-based, and Eq. 
11, Eq. 12 and Eq. 15, although they are different expressions, they give 
the same results. 

To  sum  up,  experimental  techniques  have  been  improved  signifi-
cantly  over  the  past  decade.  Detailed  analysis  can  be  achieved  using 
larger-scale devices with various test materials and complex operating 
conditions. However, such rigs are expensive to build and operate. More 
PBI studies are expected to be conducted in small experimental BFs. The 
development  of  a  database  of  different  kinds  of  biomass  and  biochar 
under  different  operating  conditions  is  still  an  open  topic  of  great 

importance. 

Mathematical Modeling studies 

As previously outlined, BF practice using PBI is generally similar to 
PCI. The combustion of the char in PCI or charcoal in PBI commences in 
the tuyeres and extends into the raceways and perhaps some remnant 
particles  reach  the  coke  bed.  It  involves  gas-particle  transportation, 
combustion chemical reactions, turbulence, heat transfer, etc. 

Compared  with  experimental  studies,  provided  the  physical  and 
chemical mechanisms involved are faithfully identified, replicated and 
validated, mathematical modelling studies can provide detailed insight 
regarding  in-furnace  phenomena.  It  can  offer  cost-effective  tools  for 
process  design  and  optimisation  without  the  risk  of  affecting  furnace 
performance by direct experimentation [112,113]. 

This  section  reviews  the  formulation  of  unit  processes  related  to 
biomass combustion in BFs and discusses several previous mathematical 
modellings approaches of PBI. 

Modelling methods 

PBI  can  be  mathematically  described  by  means  of  continuum, 
discrete  or  continuum-discrete  approaches,  typically  represented  by 
computational  fluid  dynamics  (CFD),  the  discrete  element  method 
(DEM)  or  CFD-DEM.  CFD  simulations  have  played  a  key  role  in  the 
modelling  of  BF  processes,  especially  where  direct  measurement  is 
difficult  or  experimental  study  is  complex  [114].  It  works  well  in 
balancing the computational expense and the acceptable accurate pre-
diction to design and operational issues, as seen in recent CFD works of 
BFs[211,213,216,218,219,221]. 

CFD has already been used to simulate PBI in simplified systems, e.g., 
a combustion chamber [67,69], or in a tuyere-raceway system with an 
assumed  raceway  shape  [115].  Also,  a  full  BF  shaft  [29]  has  been 
simulated from lab-scale to pilot-scale and industrial-scale, see Table 7. 
All previous models have been steady state. 

As  noted  in  Table  8,  the  existing  CFD  models  have  either  been 
developed from scratch (in-house code / open-source) or have utilised 
commercial software (closed-source) such as ANSYS-Fluent or ANSYS- 
CFX. Both are based on the same theory but different in the aspects of 
cost, scalability and flexibility, etc. The open-source is free and has clear 
advantages to implement new models in the code with full access to the 
code, but requires a steeper learning curve. The commercial software is 
easy to start up and all code released are subject to an extensive verifi-
cation system, but users cannot access the code. 

Generally, CFD models of the PBI process are composed of transient 
or time-averaged conservation equations and chemical reactions for the 
gas and particle phases. These are discussed in detail in Sections 3.2 and 
3.3. 

Gas-particle turbulent flow and heat transfer

turbulence and particle dispersion, and gas-particle interaction [116]. 
Optionally,  gas-particle  phases  are  described  either  by 
the 
Eulerian-Eulerian  (E-E)  or  the  Eulerian-Lagrange  (E-L)  computational 
approaches [117]. Both treat the gas phase as a continuum by solving 
the Navier-Stokes equations but treat the particle phase differently. In 
the  E-E  description,  the  gas  phase  and  the  particle  phase  are  inter-
penetrating  continua,  and  is  also  called  the  two-fluid  model  (TFM) 
[118]. 

In the E-L description, the motion of biomass particles is treated by a 
discrete  phase  model.  The  particle-particle  force  does  not  need  to  be 
considered  if  the  particles  exist  in  a  dilute  phase  (volume  fraction  of 
(cid:0) 6 [119]). In contrast, the particle-particle force should 
particles, εp <10
(cid:0) 3  [119]) using 
be considered if the particle is a dense phase (εp  >10
CFD-DEM  approach  [120][204,209,215][220].  Most  of  the  existing 
published  CFD  PBI  models  are  based  on  the  former,  that  is,  the  E-L 
framework without particle-particle force interaction. The interactions 
between  gas  and  particle  phases  have  been  simulated  using  either 
one-way or two-way coupling in terms of the exchange of momentum, 
mass, and energy. The following modelling work will be discussed based 
on steady-state and the E-L framework. 

Gas-phase sub-models  

1)  Flow and turbulence 

The flow regime in actual PBI is turbulent, and therefore, the effects 
of  turbulence  and  convective heat  transfer  must  be considered  in the 
model. Turbulent flow can be regarded as a superposition of eddies of 
various scales with random size and direction. The large- and small-scale 
eddies  are  mainly  determined  by  boundary  conditions  (inertia)  and 
viscous  force,  and  result  in  low-  and  high-frequency  fluctuations, 
respectively [121]. Turbulence models can be classified as Direct Nu-
merical Simulation (DNS), Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and Reynolds 
Averaged  Navier-Stokes  (RANS).  Among  these,  the  RANS  method  is 
based on the concept of solving the time-averaged Navier-Stokes equa-
tion  and  is  the  most  used  method  for  steady-state  simulation.  When 
using the RANS method, the turbulence model needs to be applied for 
closure due to the additional unknown terms, i.e., Reynolds stresses, in 
the  averaging  procedure.  The  steady-state  RANS  model  and  the 

continuity equation are listed as Eq. 16 and Eq. 17.

Among the various turbulence models, the k-ε model and its variants 
(the RNG and Realisable k-ε  models) are the most commonly used to 
close the RANS equation. The k-ε model [122] is the most used turbu-
lence model with a good balance between numerical effort and ability of 
the  simulation  to  faithfully  imitate  observed  behaviour.  As  listed  in 
Table 8, the existing CFD PBI models all use the k-ε model (Eq. 18 and 
Eq.  19).  The  transport  equation  for  turbulence  kinetic  energy  (k)  is 
derived from the exact equation, and the dissipation rate (ε) is obtained 
with phenomenological considerations. Cε1, C ε2, and Cε3 are constants, 
Pk  and Pkb  are related to the buoyancy forces. The phenomenological 
considerations are not always suitable; therefore, a RNG k-ε  model is 
proposed  in  a  similar  form  but  replacing  the  model  constants  by  the 
function to improve the accuracy for rapid strained flows. In addition, 
the  Realisable  k-ε  model  is  another  relatively  new  approach  that  in-
volves a modified transport equation for ε, which has been derived from 
an  exact  equation  for  the  transport  of  the  mean-square  vorticity 
fluctuation.

1)  Heat transfer 

Heat transfer is governed by the energy transport equation (Eq. 20). 
The terms from the left are convection, conduction, the viscous effect, 
and source terms (SE) representing the heat released from chemical re-
actions  or  other  volumetric  heat  sources,  respectively.  The  transient 
term is not included in the steady-state equation.

Particle phase sub-models  

1)  Particle transport modelling 

Particle  transport  modelling  includes  tracking  particle  flow  and 
dispersion  due to  turbulence using  the Lagrangian method  and  a  sto-
chastic  model,  respectively  [123].  The  PSD  can  be  described  by  a 
Rosin-Rammler equation, or it can be uniformly distributed by mass or 
number.  Different  from  coal  particles,  biomass/biochar  particles  are 
relatively lower density, non-spherical (typically cylinder and flat chip) 
and porous (hollow), which greatly affects the motion and conversion of 
biomass  particles  [124].  Regarding  the  non-spherical  porous  biomass 
particle motion, there are three approaches available depending on the 
complexity required, details of which have been reviewed in Ref. [124]. 
The detailed description of particles such as shape, porous structure and 
movement  can  benefit  the  accuracy  of  simulation  but  decreases  the 
computational efficiency. In order to improve computational efficiency, 
numerical  simulation  usually  simplifies  the  complexity  in  describing 
chemical reactions or particle behaviour. 

Approach 1: Biomass particles are assumed to be spherical and solid. 
The transfer of momentum between the gas and the biomass particles is 
represented by the drag coefficient (CD). This is the simplest method and 
has been frequently used in PCI modelling work.

Approach 2: Shape factors are introduced to simulate non-sphericity, 
based on either an equal-volume or equal-mass sphere. Shape factors are 
defined as the ratio of either the surface area or the cross-sectional area 
of the actual non-spherical particles to that of the equivalent sphere (by 
volume or mass). The drag force on a non-spherical particle is a function 
of spherical particle Reynolds number and one or more shape factors. 
Liu et al. [69] introduced a shape factor, ѱcross-sectional (Eq. 23) to modify 
the drag force based on the equal-volume sphere. This method is now the 
commonly used method in biomass-related CFD models. 

ψ cross(cid:0) sectional =

Areabio(cid:0) cross
Areasphere(cid:0) cross

(23) 

Approach 3: The motion of non-spherical biomass particles includes 
both translation and rotation [125]. The particle force balance includes 

a  drag  for  non-spherical  particles,  an  additional  lift  due  to  particle 
non-sphericity and a virtual mass force due to the relatively low-density 
biomass particles, as well as gravity and a pressure-gradient force [125]. 
This method can accurately simulate the motion of biomass particles but 
has not been applied to PBI model due to the computational cost and 
implementation difficulty.  

1)  Particle heat transfer modelling 

As listed in Fig. 12, the change in particle temperature is determined 
from the energy balance of particles governed concurrently by convec-
tive,  latent  heat  transfer  associated  with  mass  transfer  (enthalpies  of 
reactions) and radiative heat transfer, respectively, as shown in Eq. 24. 
[126] 

Convective  heat  flux  includes  heat  transfer  due  to  advection  and 
diffusion. The convective heat transfer coefficient, hi,conv, is associated 
with the Nusselt number, which is a function of Re and Pr, and is eval-
uated using the correlation of Ranz and Marshall, as shown in Eq. 26 
[127]. The latent heat transfer associated with mass transfer is shown as 
Eq.  27.  Hreac  is  temperature-dependent.  The  effects  of  non-spherical 
particle shape on heat transfer cannot be ignored. For example, Liu et 
al. [69] introduced a shape factor, ѱsurface  (Eq. 28) to modify the mass 
and heat transfer correlations based on the equal-volume sphere. The 
sum is taken over all components of the particle for which heat transfer 
is taking place.

In the high-temperature environment where PBI takes place, radia-
tion (QR) is the dominant mode of heat transfer to the particles. For the 
cool particles entering the tuyere and raceway, the particle temperature 
is affected by convective heat transfer from the surrounding hot blast, 
and radiation of heat fed back from the flame. Among the existing CFD 
PBI models, the P-1 model, the Rosseland model, the Discrete Ordinates

Gas-particle coupling 

(31)  

In the PBI process, the gas and particle phases will interact with each 
other. In the modelling of PBI, the gas-particle phases should be coupled. 
As shown in Fig. 13, one-way coupling refers to the case where the fluid 
affects  the  particles  while  particles  do  not  affect  the  fluid;  two-way 
coupling  refers  to  the  case  where  the  two  phases  affect  each  other, 
and  four-way  coupling  the  gas-particle  and  particle-particle  in-
teractions. One-way coupling is relatively simple and suitable for dilute 
phase  transportation,  where  the  effect  of  particles  on  fluid  flow  is 
negligible. The continuous phase can be approximated without consid-
ering particle trajectories. Two-way coupling adds a particle source term 
to  the  gas-phase  momentum  equation,  which  is  either  the  turbulent 
dispersion  force  or  resistance.  This  two-way  coupling  is  achieved  by 
alternately solving the discrete and continuous phase equations until the 
solutions  for  both  phases  converge.  For  PBI  simulation,  two-way 
coupling is the most used method. 

Chemical Reactions 

Generally, as shown in Fig. 14, biomass particles are pretreated to 
charcoal before being injected into the BF. The charcoal particles are 
carried by conveying gas through a lance to the tuyere, then mixed with 
hot blast supplied through a blowpipe in the tuyere and then piped to the 
raceway, which then propagates the reactions. The particles undergo a 
multistage  process  which  comprises  rapid  heating,  moisture  evapora-
tion, devolatilisation, VM combustion, char combustion and gasification 
[128,134,135]. Since the raceway is surrounded by the coke bed, coke 
reactions should also be added to give a reasonable and detailed rep-
resentation  of  the  lower  part  of  the  BF.  The  current  CFD  sub-models 
related  to chemical reactions  are  listed in  Table  11.  In the  modelling 
work, the chemical reactions are described by different reaction models. 
The sequence of different reactions is not pre-set. They may happen in 
sequence or overlap according to reaction kinetics and conditions. 

Pre-heating and moisture evaporation 

The biomass particles are preheated in the process of mixing with the 
hot blast [45], where the moisture evaporation of biomass particles also 
happens. Wijayanta et al. [67,128] set a constant devolatilisation tem-
perature of approximately 600 K [136]. This method is easy to imple-
ment but hardly reflects the effect of moisture evaporation on biomass 
particle  temperature.  An  Arrhenius  type  description  is  a  common 
method to describe moisture evaporation [137]. Liu et al. [117] applied 
a finite-rate chemical model with Arrhenius kinetic data obtained from 
the  study  of  Chan  et  al.  [138]  to  describe  the  moisture  evaporation 
process.  However,  the  Arrhenius  approach  is  not  detailed  enough  to 
reflect the change in the local gas composition around single biomass 
particles due to moisture evaporation.

model (DO), and the Discrete transfer radiation method (DTRM) are the 
most commonly used radiation models. For example, P-1 is applied in 
these PBI models [67,113,128], while DTRM is applied in the following 
studies [65,69,115]. For PBI, the particle emissivity is changing as the 
reaction proceeds and is dependent on the mass fractions of char. The 
following considerations are used when deciding which radiation model 
is most suitable. 

DTRM [129] is relatively simple and is suitable for a very wide range 
of optical thicknesses. The “ray tracing” technique used in DTRM, which 
is based on solving representative directed beams of radiation within the 
enclosure, can provide a prediction of radiative heat transfer between 
surfaces without explicit view factor calculations. However, DTRM as-
sumes the reflection of all surfaces is isotropic with respect to the solid 
angle  without  considering  the  effect  of  scattering.  The  accuracy  of 
DTRM  can  be  improved  by  increasing  the  number  of  rays.  However, 
using more rays means greater computational expense. 

Compared  with  DTRM, the P-1  model (Eq.  30)  is computationally 
efficient and includes radiation scattering. For a large optical thickness, 
the P-1 model is more stable, and it is easy to deal with the problem of 
complex geometric radiation. A detailed review of P-1 modelling can be 
found in Ref. [130] with special consideration of the combustion pro-
cess. However, the P-1 model was reported to over-predict radiative heat 
flux in a boiler furnace [131]. 

The Rosseland radiation model represents a different approach and 
assumes the radiation intensity is equal to the black-body intensity at the 
gas  temperature  and  is  suitable  for  optically  thick  media  [132].  The 
Rosseland model (Eq. 31) introduces a diffusion term, where the diffu-
sion  coefficient  varies  significantly  with  temperature.  The  DO  model 
solves  the  radiative  transport equation  in a  set  of  different directions 
followed  by  the  integrals.  However,  DO  has  been  reported  to  have 
problems like false scattering and ray effects [133].

Devolatilisation 

When the particles are heated to a sufficiently high temperature, the 
carbon  network  will  thermally  decompose  and  progressively  release 
VM,  including  tar  into  the  gas  phase.  The  rate  of  devolatilisation  is 
controlled by the rate of the thermal decomposition reaction, which is 
affected by many factors, such as heating rate, particle size, etc. Most PBI 
models  assume  uniform  temperature  within  each  of  the  particles 
because  of their  small  size. The VM is  assumed  to  leave the  particles 
instantly without heat and mass transfer inside the particles. 

Under typical PCI conditions, this process can be completed within 
0.1  seconds.  In  this  short  period  of  time,  it  is  very  complicated  to 
simulate all of the decomposition behaviour of biomass according to the 
actual  molecular  structure,  which  will  not  be  precisely  known  [45]. 
Also,  the  VM  composition  is  both  complex  and  variable  due  to  the 
chemical and structural complexity of biomass. Therefore, PBI models 
use assumptions to simplify this process. VM is usually simplified to pure 
substance,  a  mixture  of  fixed  components  and  several  independent 
materials,  as  listed  in  Table  9,  without  changes.  The  first  treatment 
simplifies the VM to be one homogeneous gas of CαHβOγNδ  [67,128]. 
The second treatment only considers the main components of VM by a 
mixture of three combustible gas species of CH4, CO and H2  [69,117]. 
The third treatment simplifies the VM to be two homogeneous gases of 
Cx1Hy1Oz1 and Cx2Hy2Oz2 [115], which relate to the two-competing re-
action model (Eq. 33). The value of x, y, z and α, β, γ, δ are based on the 
composition of the injectant. 

The  existing  biomass  devolatilisation  sub-models  have  been 
reviewed in Ref. [124,139]. The frequently used Arrhenius type devo-
latilisation  models  for  PBI  are  summarised  in  Table  10.  The  first 
sub-model  is  the  One-global  reaction  model  with  a  constant  reaction 
rate, Eq. 32. The VM is released at a constant rate, where the A0, fv,0, fw, 
0  and mp,0  are the rate constant, initial fraction of VM in particle and 
evaporating  material,  and  initial  particle  mass  [67,128].  Here,  the 
devolatilisation temperature was set at a reasonable but arbitrary con-
stant value that is used to control the onset of devolatilisation [136].

The second option for devolatilisation is the two-competing reaction 
model  proposed  by  Ubhayakar  et  al.  [140],  using  the  Arrhenius  type 
reaction rate changing with the particle temperature [69,115,117]. A 
pair of first-order reactions is applied with different parameters (k1, k2), 
VM  yields 
(Treatment  1: 
x1CH4+y1CO+z1H2,  x2CH4+y2CO+z2H2,  or  Treatment  2:  Cx1Hy1Oz1, 

(α1,  α2),  and  VM  compositions 

to  release 

light  VM  under 

Cx2Hy2Oz2).  This  sub-model  includes  the  basic  devolatilisation  with 
the 
moderate  activation  energy 
low-temperature  environment  plus  a  secondary  step  to  describe  the 
possible  additional  cracking  of  particle  to  release  heavy  VM  under  a 
high-temperature environment, thus overcoming the inaccuracy of the 
one-step global model. The Q-factor relates to enhanced volatilisation 
compared with the standard VM determined by proximate analysis. This 
is  reported  to  be  related  to  the  experimental  conditions  and  material 
properties, is applied in the secondary path (Eq. 33), representing the 
enhancement effect of high heating rates and high-temperature condi-
tions in the raceway region. A relationship has been determined from 
the data in Fig. 1 of Ref. [141] by linearly fitting the measured Q-factors 
(Q)  for  a  range  of  coals  used  in  Australia.  This  formulation  has  been 
extended to biomass.

The  devolatilisation  process  for  coal  is  accompanied  by  particle 
swelling, which affects the internal surface area and thus the reactivity 
of the coal char [142]. A swelling coefficient (Cs) is a simple qualitative 
assessment  of  the  change  in  coal  particle  size  during  devolatilisation 
(Eq.  34).  However,  it  has  been  experimentally  found  that  charcoal 
particles do not swell much during the devolatilisation because of the 
remnant  cellular  structure  [65].  In  the  numerical  study  of  PBI,  the 
swelling coefficient of charcoal particles can be set to zero (Cs = 0).

Devolatilisation can be considered to be either a kinetic process or a 
physicochemical  process  [142].  An  Arrhenius  type  model  is  a  kinetic 
model which assumes that the heating rate of the particles is much faster 
than  the  chemical  reactions  related  to  bond  breaking  [142].  A 
phenomenological model is a physical interpretation of the devolatili-
sation process, which assumes that the chemical reaction is faster than 
the  heating  rate  of  the  particles  [142].  Typical  phenomenological 
models  are  FG-DVC  (Functional  Group  -  Depolymerisation,  Vapor-
isation, Cross-linking) [143], Bio-FLASCHAIN (Bio-FC) [144] and CPD 
(Chemical  Percolation  Devolatilisation)  models  [145].  The  Arrhenius 
type model has been widely used in PBI simulation, which is because of 
the high heating rate within the raceway and is computationally effi-
cient  compared  with  the  phenomenological  models.  However,  in  the 
future,  to  obtain  greater detail  and  improve  the  simulation,  more  so-
phisticated  phenomenological  models  are  suggested  with  detailed 
sub-process  and  products, 
including  product  composition  and 
properties.

Combustion of the gas phase 

VM and char are the two products of devolatilisation. VM combus-
tion  occurs  earlier  than  char  combustion  due  to  the  lower  ignition 
temperature and the faster homogeneous gas-phase reaction occurring 
in a highly turbulent environment. Therefore, the first stage of biomass 
particle combustions is triggered by VM ignition [146]. Examining the 
options  for  devolatilisation  products,  the  homogeneous  gas-phase 
combustion  reactions  could  be  classified  into:  i)  a  pure  substance 
(CαHβOγNδ); ii) a fixed composition mixture (Cx1Hy1Oz1, Cx2Hy2Oz2), or 
iii) several independent materials (CO, CH4, H2). These are as detailed in 
Table 11. 

Usually, the choice of the gas-phase combustion model depends on 
how  much  faster  the  chemical  reaction  is  than  turbulent  mixing,  as 
shown in Fig. 15. If the time scale of the chemical reaction is far smaller 
than the time scale of turbulent mixing, it is mixing dominant, and two 
types  of  models  are  commonly  used,  Eddy-based  model and  Mixture- 
based  model.  If  the  time  scale  of  the  chemical  reaction  is  not  far 
smaller than turbulent mixing, both the reaction and turbulent mixing 
should be considered in the rate analysis. Typically, there are Arrhenius 
type model, Finite rate model (FR), FR-Eddy dissipation model (EDM), 
Eddy dissipation  concept (EDC)  model, etc.  Also, there are  some sub- 
models  related  to  pollutants,  such  as  NO  formation  model  and  soot 
models. 

In the eddy-based models, EDM [147] was developed based on the 
eddy break-up model [148]. The Eddy break up model was designed to 
predict  the time-averaged flow and composition for premixed flames, 
making it unsuitable for non-premixed PBI case. In EDM, the reaction 
rate is represented by the average concentration of reactants, turbulent 
kinetic  energy,  and  the  rate  of  dissipation  of  this  energy.  It  does  not 
require the prediction of fluctuations in reacting species and is therefore 
suitable  for  premixed  flames  and  diffusion  flames.  On  this  basis,  it  is 
certainly applicable to the combustion of PBI under BF conditions where 
the temperature is extremely high (~2,800 K). In Liu et al.’s PBI model 
[115],  EDM is used to model VM combustion, where  [i] is the  molar 
concentration of the reactants, v
i  is stoichiometric coefficient for [i] and 
Cedm is an EDM constant.

In the mixture fraction models, the Laminar Flamelet Model [149] is 
a non-equilibrium version of the classical “Burke-Schumann” limit, the 
so-called  equilibrium  chemistry  model.  The  equilibrium  chemistry 
model is developed to overcome the inability of the “mixed is burnt” 
model, which cannot predict intermediate species formation. However, 
the  equilibrium  chemistry  model  is  not  suitable  for  PBI  simulation 
because  of  the  fuel-rich  zone  of  non-premixed  combustion  and 
non-equilibrium  reactions  within  the  raceway.  The  Laminar  Flamelet 
Model of non-premixed combustion describes the interaction of chem-
istry and turbulence in the fast reaction zone. It is assumed that com-
bustion  takes  place  in  a  thin  sheet  whose  internal  structure  is  called 
flamelets.  The  turbulent  flame  itself  is  regarded  as  a  collection  of 
flamelets embedded in the flow field. 

However,  when  the  time  scale  of  reaction  is  not  significantly  less 
than that of the mixing, the reaction is controlled both by the chemical 
reaction and turbulent mixing. In the global single/multi-step reaction 
model,  a  single-step  reaction  model  describes  the  complete  or  partial 
oxidation of one or more components of the VM gases. In the current PBI 
models, only the oxidation reactions of H2, CO, and CH4 are described by 
an  Arrhenius  type  equation  for  computational  efficiency.  Liu  et  al.’s 
pilot-scale model [69] used the global multi-step reaction  model (Eq. 
37)  to  describe  the  gas  phase  combustion,  which  can  save  multiple 
detailed input parameters.

EDC model is suitable for presenting a detailed chemical mechanism. 
The chemical reaction in EDC is affected by the Arrhenius rate, and the 
reaction  occurs  in  small  turbulent  structures,  which  is  a  function  of 
turbulent  viscosity  and  dissipation  rate.  Even  though  EDC  provides  a 
way to consider the detailed chemical reactions involved in turbulent 
mixing and combustion, it is computationally expensive for simulating 
PCI/PBI to faithfully imitate observed behaviour, which involves a large 
number of chemical reactions [151]. 

Combustion and gasification of char 

Another  main  product  of  devolatilisation  is  char,  which  will  go 
through heterogeneous combustion and gasification reactions within the 
environment of O2, CO2 and H2O. The reaction of char with oxygen may 
produce CO or CO2, shown as Eq. 42 and Eq. 43. Also, Eq. 42 and Eq. 43 
occur together with changeable CO/CO2  ratio, thus the combustion of 
char  could  be  written  as  Eq.  44.  The  stoichiometric  parameter  φ  ex-
presses the dependency of the CO/CO2 ratio on the particle temperature. 
Char gasification can also involve CO2 and H2O, Eq. 46 and Eq. 47. 

Heterogeneous reactions between the char and gas components (O2, 
CO2,  and H2O) are multi-step controlled, involving gas diffusion to the 
surface  of  the  char  particles,  surface  chemical  reaction,  and  product 
diffusion away from the surface. These steps depend on the temperature 
and composition of the gas phase, as well as particle properties. The char 
formed from biomass/biochar may have different properties (swelling 
index, internal surface area, porosity) that may affect the char reactivity 
significantly. According to the controlling steps of the overall rate of the 
heterogeneous reactions of the char particles, three main regimes have 
been  identified:  Regime  I  -  kinetic-controlled  at  low-temperature; 
Regime III - diffusion-controlled at high-temperature, or controlled by 
both factors in Regime II [152], as shown in Fig. 16. 

Typically, there are two classifications of CFD models for describing 
the char combustion and gasification process. The one is based on the 
dominant  step  of  the  process,  and  another  is  based  on  the  intrinsic 
particle properties, as listed in Fig. 17.

FR-EDM is an extension of EDM, taking the minimum of the Arrhe-
nius reaction rate and the eddy current dissipation rate as the reaction 
rate (Eq. 38). In the flame zone, the eddy dissipation rate is usually lower 
than the Arrhenius rate, and the degree of mixing is the controlling step. 
The  model  is  limited  to  a  one-step  (reactant-product)  or  two-step 
(reactant-intermediate, intermediate-product) global reaction, and this 
is also suitable for reversible reactions. In FR-EDM, the FR formula, Rg, 
Arr, considers both the forward and back reactions, Eq. 39, and the EDM 
formula, Rg,EDM, based on the smaller of the reactions limiter, Eq. 40, 
and product limiter, Eq. 41. The net reaction rate is taken as the mini-
mum  of  these  two  rates,  Eq.  38,  [150].  This  model  has  been  used  in 
Wijayanta et al.’s PBI simulation model [67,128].

The diffusion-limited rate model is derived from the Baum and Street 
models [136]. The reaction rate is shown in Eq. 49. The model assumes 
that during the reaction, the char particle diameter remains unchanged, 
the  particle  mass  decreases,  the  effective  density  decreases,  and  the 
particles become porous. The diffusion-limited rate model is applied to 
reactions occurring in regime III, where the environmental temperature 
is extremely high. The model assumes that the surface reaction rate is 
much  larger  than  the  rate  for  the  diffusion  step,  thereby  the  kinetic 
contribution to the surface reaction rate is ignored [153]. To account for 
the non-spherical particle shape of biomass and the stoichiometry of the 
reaction, Sb, the mass of oxygen per unit mass of char is modified by an 
enhancement factor, ϕen. The enhancement factor is the ratio of average 
oxygen mass flux at the surface of a non-spherical biomass particle to an 
equivalent spherical particle [154].

The  kinetic/diffusion-limited  reaction  model  has  a  wider  range  of 
applications  than  the  diffusion-limited  reaction  model.  This  model 
considers  the  kinetic  contribution  of  both  the  diffusion  steps  and  the 
surface reaction step for the heterogeneous char combustion or gasifi-
cation  reactions.  The  diffusion  steps  are  related  to  the  supply  and 
removal of the reactant gases through the particle boundary layer, and 
the  surface  reaction  is  governed  by  the  processes  of  adsorption  and 
desorption. 

The  Baum  and  Street  model  is  a  typical  kinetic/diffusion-limited 
model (Eq. 50) [136], the rate of which depends on both physical and 
chemical control. Physical control is the diffusion of the gas components 
to the particle surface. Chemical control is the surface reaction of the gas 
phase  and  char,  and  also  includes  the  combustion  products  diffusing 
away from the surface. The model assumes that the particle size can be 
expressed as a linear function of VM burnout and can incorporate both 
the swelling and surface factors in the model. 

The Baum and Street model has been used in a PBI model [67,128]. 
In the model, φ  is the ratio between the reacting surface and external 
surface area of the particle, Φ is the mechanism factor, Dox  is the oxy-
gen’s diffusion coefficient in cm2/s, mp is the char particle mass in g, Tp 
is the char particle surface temperature in K, Tg is the gas temperature in 
K and Tox is the temperature of oxygen in K.

Field’s model [155] is another typical kinetic/diffusion-limited rate 
model. In Field’s model, a char particle is considered to be spherical and 
surrounded by a stagnant boundary layer through which O2 or CO2 must 
diffuse  before  they  react  with  the  particle.  On  this  basis,  it  is  more 
suitable for coke reactions in the coke bed. This model will be discussed 
in section 3.3.5. 

However, the above kinetic/diffusion-limited reaction models ignore 
the intrinsic properties of the char particles formed from biomass/bio-
char, such as their porous nature. Intrinsic models are more powerful for 
describing  the  reaction  rate  of  heterogeneous  char  combustion  and 
gasification in PBI. The particle reaction is described by the shrinking 
core or reacting core method [156], where the porous diffusion is re-
flected  by  the  Thiele  modulus  (Th),  representing  the  relationship  be-
tween the chemical dynamics and diffusion time scales. The shrinking 
core  method  is  applied  when  Th<1,  where  heterogeneous  reactions 
occur on the surface without being limited by the diffusion of gaseous 
reactants into the solid particles. The reacting core method is applied 
when Th>1, where the gaseous reactant diffuses into the particles, and a 
volumetric reaction is observed in the solid. Generally, in the PBI pro-
cess, the reacting core method is used for drying and pyrolysis, and the 
shrinking core model is used for the gasification and combustion of char 
[63]. 

Smith’s model [157] is a typical intrinsic model. Smith’s model also 
assumes that the surface reaction rate includes the effects of both bulk 
diffusion and chemical reaction (Eq. 51). Smith’s model assumes that 
the reaction is first order. The intrinsic model uses the same equation for 
kinetic/diffusion-limited reaction to compute the diffusion rate. How-
ever,  the  chemical  rate,  Rc,  is  explicitly  expressed  in  terms  of  the 
intrinsic chemical and pore diffusion rates. It responds to temperature 
and oxygen concentration and is dependent on the decreasing particle 
size during char combustion. This is because of three interacting factors: 
(i)  the  intrinsic  rate of  chemical reaction  of  oxygen with  the  internal 
surface of the particle, (ii) the area of this surface, and (iii) the extent to 
which  oxygen  diffusion  through  the  pores  (which  form  the  internal 
surface) restricts the reaction rate [157]. Moreover, different from the 
previous models, the PF particle density in this model is set as a constant 
because the reaction rate coefficients are reported to be proportional to 
the burnout and inversely proportional to particle size [157]. 

The  relationship  between  Ri  (and  hence  Rc)  and  the  coefficient  of 
intrinsic chemical reactivity, ki (the rate of reaction per unit area of pore 
wall  per  [unit  concentration  of  oxygen]m  in  the  absence  of  any  mass 
transfer or pore diffusion limitation) is given by:

modulus,  and  ki  is  the  kinetic  rate,  defined  by  an  Arrhenius  type

The  Gibb  model  [158]  is  another  typical  intrinsic  model,  which 
considers  both  the  rate  of  diffusion  to  the  surface  and  the  rate  of 
chemical reaction at the surface, for example, the oxidation mechanism 
of carbon according to Eq. 44. By solving the oxygen diffusion equation 
analytically,  (Eq.  52)  is  obtained  for  the  rate  of  decrease  in  the  char 
mass. This has been used in Liu’s PBI model [69,115] to describe the 
combustion and gasification of char within the raceway.

Note, the far-field oxygen concentration ρ∞  is taken to be the time-

k1 is the rate of external diffusion, k2 is the surface reaction rate, and k3 
represents the rate of internal diffusion and surface reaction. kc  is the 

carbon  oxidation  rate,  defined  by  the  modified  Arrhenius  equation. 
ѱsurface  is  shape  factor,  and  Dp  is  pore  diffusivity,  which  is  computed 
from external diffusivity (D). Tc is activation temperature (K), Tc=Ec/R, 
which is another kind of expression of activation energy (J/mol). The 
default values of the model constants are AC=14 [m/(s K)], TC=21580 K, 
and these two parameters are the same for different charcoals. D is the 
external diffusion coefficient of oxygen in the surrounding gas. Dref is the 
(cid:0) 5  [kg/(m s)]); Tref  is 
dynamic diffusivity (recommended value is 1.8e
the reference temperature (recommended value is 293 K). А, the expo-
nent  has  a  value  of  0.75.  This  model  has  been  used  to  describe  char 
combustion and gasification in Liu’s PBI model [69,115]. 

A partial/full combustion model (Eq. 53) was used in de Castro et 
al.’s  PBI  model  [29],  where  the  fine  char  particles  combust  either 
partially to CO or fully to CO2. de Castro et al.’s model [29] considered 
the  overall  combustion  rate,  combining  chemical  reaction  and  gas 
diffusion. The mechanism involves a fixed proportion of Eq. 44 and Eq. 
45, and the properties are estimated under the average temperature of 
the gas and particle phases, Tave. 

The  volumetric  particle  surface  area  is  a  function  of  the  particle 
diameter, shape factor and volume fraction, Apch. In this approach, the 
reactivity and pore structure of char particles play an important role in 
the  total  reaction  rate.  These  characteristics  include  the  specific  rate 
constant, kave  and ηave, the  Thiele modulus  Θ  and  the  effective  intra- 
particle  diffusion  coefficient,  Deff
O2 .  The  parameters  ζpch  and  τpch  are 
particle porosity and pore tortuosity and depend on the internal particle 
structure of the pulverised biochar particles, which, in turn, are affected 
by the raw biomass materials and the pretreatment process.

Combustion and gasification of coke 

Field’s  model  [155]  is  also  a  typical  kinetic/diffusion-limited  rate 
model  (Eq.  54).  In  Field’s  model,  a  coke  particle  is  considered  to  be 
spherical and surrounded by a stagnant boundary layer through which 
O2  or  CO2  diffuse  before  they  react  with  the  coke.  The  reaction  is 
determined by both the rate of diffusion to the surface, kd, and the rate of 
chemical reaction at the surface, kc. Field’s model is applied for coke 
reactions, not char reactions. Different from biomass/biochar particles, 
coke particles in the coke bed could be treated as unmoved and thus 
surrounded by a stagnant boundary layer. This model has been used for 
describing coke combustion and gasification in Liu’s PBI model [115].

CFD PBI models and validations 

CFD  models  have  been  used  to  treat  PCI  and  iron  ore  reduction 
individually,  due  to  the  significant  difference  in  the  time  scales  of 
injectant combustion within the raceway and the reduction of iron ore 
outside  raceway,  i.e.,  tens  of  milliseconds  vs.  several  hours.  In  the 
modelling  work  for  PBI,  as  summarised  in  Fig.  18,  the  scale  of  the 
domain  is  developed  from  pilot-scale  to  industrial-scale,  and  the 
coverage of the domain is increased from the local tuyere/raceway re-
gion (Fig. 19) to the full lower zone (Fig. 22) and then to the whole BF 
(Fig. 24). 

The pilot-scale PBI models (Fig. 19) have been focused on the regions 
of combustion, including lance, tuyere, and raceway (or centreline of the 
raceway). The blowpipe was usually ignored or simplified as a short tube 

Fig. 20. Model validation of PBI model in Ref. [128] with DTF measurement in 
terms  of  mole  fraction  of  O2  and  CO2.  (reprinted  from  Ref.  [128]  with 
permission of Elsevier). 

for gas transportation without any reactions or heat transfer. The lance 
was simplified as a centred horizontal lance or an inclined lance, i.e., 
closer  to  the  industrial  configuration.  The  tuyere  has  usually  been 
simplified to be a horizontal cylinder or a truncated cone. Model vali-
dations  of  these  pilot-scale  PBI  models  are  mostly  based  on  the  mea-
surement  of  DTF  and  pilot-scale  test  rig  in  terms  of  gas  composition 
(Fig. 20) and burnout (Fig. 21). 

The raceway is the most critical region as ideally all biomass particles 
should  be  fully  combusted  within  it  to  supply  the  BF  with  heat  and 
reducing gas. The combustion of biomass in the raceway is found to have 
less differential pressure drop than for coal, which is reflected by greater 
flame stability [27]. On this basis, PBI would have a few requirements 
affecting tuyere configuration. However, Wu et al. [113] reported that it 
is necessary to reposition the tuyere and lance for PBI to avoid over-
heating of the tuyere. This modelling may need further investigation by 
including greater more geometric details, i.e., raceway and surrounding 
coke bed. 

The industrial-scale PBI models have been based on either the BF’s 
lower zone (Fig. 22 [115]) or the entire BF (Fig. 24 [29]). Model vali-
dation of the PBI model in Ref. [115] was done with pilot-scale test rig 
measurement  and  lab-scale  DTF  in  terms  of  burnouts,  as  showed  in 
Fig. 23. The domain contains more sub-regions, such as the surrounding 
coke bed. The tuyere/raceway regions use industrial-scale dimensions,

also stabilised combustion flow and made coke flow more uniform [160, 
161]. 

A  significant  improvement  in  raceway  features  has  been  incorpo-
rated  in  recent  PBI  models,  including  formation,  morphology,  and 
combustion behaviours. A review of raceway formation can be found in 
Refs. [114,162]. The raceway models have been improved from 1D in 
the  1980s  and  2D  in  the  1990s  to  3D  in  the  2000s.  [141]  Typically 
raceway  formation  models  have  been  2D  or  3D  cold  models  with 
gas-solid  flow  [163–167],  or  models  with  heat  transfer  and  chemical 
reactions  [168,169].  In  the  cold  models,  the  energy  equations  were 
ignored, as the reactions of coke and biomass were considered to have 
little effect on the pressure and thus the shape of the raceway [167]. 
However, when heat transfer and chemical reactions were considered, it 
was found that the raceway, including its shape and size, mutually in-
teracts  with  the  injectant  stream,  e.g.,  to  reflect  a  change  in  blast 
temperature. 

The first 2D CFD hot model [170] and another DEM model [169] 
both  found  that  raceway  size  becomes  larger  under  the  conditions  of 
co-injection  of  blast  and  particles  than  blast-only  injection.  A  3D 
steady-state  raceway  formation  model  was  developed  to  design  the 
re-start  operation,  including  the  reactions  and  detailed  operating  pa-
rameters  [171].  The  change  from  coal  to  biomass  as  the  injectant  is 
considered to have few effects on raceway morphology since the parti-
cles are a dilute phase. There may be a problem when increasing the 
biomass injection rate to a high level because of the significant physical 
properties difference between biomass and coal, such as density issue 
[172]. 

The interior of the raceway is influenced by both the physical and 
chemical behaviour of gas/particles and also by the permeability within 
the surrounding coke bed. There are voids within the fixed bed of coke 
particles, so a porous medium assumption could be used to simulate the 
coke bed region, as seen in Ref. [116]. One improvement has been made 
in Zhuo’s PCI model (Fig. 22(b)) with the coke flows within the raceway 
considered.  There  are  two  gas-particle  flows  in  this  transient  model

but  the  geometry  is  simplified  to  a  greater  or  lesser  extent  for  better 
balancing the computational cost and simulation accuracy. The simpli-
fication in geometry is largely dependent on the level of details in the 
target. For example, in one case, the tuyere was assumed to be a hori-
zontal truncated cone with more details [113], while in another case, it 
was an inclined truncated cone [159]. 

The tuyere is responsible for stabilizing the gas/particle flow and the 
resulting  raceway  morphology  [160].  Studies  of  both  cold  and  hot 
◦
models have found that a 7
downward tuyere angle would give the less 
fluctuated and larger raceway pattern (depth and height). This angle;

based on the measurement of the commercial BF with measured radial

assumed the  raceway region to be an  inlet and  did not consider geo-
metric details. Therefore, this model cannot provide data on the com-

understanding local flow and combustion behaviour, in the future, the 
whole  BF  should  be  integrated  into  modelling  studies  by  offline 
connection or online coupling.

To sum up, depending on objectives, it is acceptable to simplify the 
geometry of the raceway and tuyere. However, greater detail is required 
when  improving  to  a  3D  model  at  larger-scale  with  more  sub-region 
details since biomass combustion will affect in-furnace phenomena, e. 
g., the temperature field. 

Most CFD PBI models have focussed on the lower sub-regions of the 
BF  rather  than  include  higher  regions.  This  is  because  it  is  computa-
tionally expensive to consider the whole BF, and the local variations in 
the  raceway  are  much  greater  than  that  in  the  shaft.  However,  the 
burden structure, cohesive zone, and especially the coke bed in the vi-
cinity  will  affect  raceway  performance,  including  the  raceway  shape, 
size, and position [116,167]. As shown in Fig. 24, de Castro et al. [29,

grinding.  Second,  low  density  decreases  the  throughput  in  the  pneu-
matic conveying lines (kg/s), so high injection rates could be difficult to 
achieve. Facility design issues include the type and configuration of the 
injection lances, tuyere protection, etc. Operational issues include the 
cost of raw biomass, the type and cost of biomass pretreatment, limited 
injection rate for low-density biochar, safety issues such as spontaneous 
combustion. 

Both  experimental  and  modelling  studies  have  been  conducted 
relating to PBI and are progressively being improved. The feasibility of 
PBI has also been analysed by HMB modelling, techno-economic anal-
ysis, and life cycle assessment (LCA). They are reviewed in the following 
sections. 

In-furnace phenomena understanding 

PBI involves complex behaviour of gas-particle in many sub-regions 
of  the  BF,  e.g.,  the  blowpipe,  lance,  tuyere,  raceway,  as  well  as  the 
surrounding coke bed, cohesive zone, and the iron ore/coke burden in 
the furnace shaft. 

Experimental studies 

Currently,  the  study  of  PBI  has  been  focused  on  sub-regions.  For 
example, TGA simulates conditions where static biomass particles are 
heated in a controlled atmosphere. It works satisfactorily for the initial 
kinetic analysis of biomass or biomass/coal blends, and off-gas analysis. 
However,  it  can  neither  reach  the  heating  rate  in  the  raceway  nor 
simulate the flow behaviour of biomass particles. 

The DTF provides a higher heating rate (see Table 1) and approxi-
mates the flow of particles with regions like the blowpipe, tuyere and 
raceway. More recently, literature has emerged that offers contradictory 
findings about the effect of heating rate on biomass fuels. For example, 
the higher heating rate was found to increase the char yield due to the 
relatively less heat transfer to the inner portions and thus less efficient 
cracking  took  place.  [175]  However,  the  higher  heating  rate  was  re-
ported to decrease the char yield due to the possible melted chars while 
fibrous  structure  of  parent  fuel  was  unable  to  retain.  [176]  Also,  the 
higher heating rate was found to increase char reactivities [177], while 
it was also reported to decrease the activation energy of combustion of 
the biomass particles [178]. Pohlmann et al. [85] used a DTF to find that 
the charcoal (thermally-treated eucalyptus wood) has a greater burnout 
than that of coals with similar VM contents. Chen et al. [53] used a DTF 
to examine the burnout of five torrefied biomass samples proposed for 
injection and found from the combustion behaviour that these samples 
were suitable to replace high-VM coal, but not low-VM coal. However, it 
must be noted that combustion behaviour is a necessary but insufficient

Application of PBI research 

Although PBI has been implemented in small Brazilian BFs for many 
years, at 100 to 150 kg-charcoal/t-HM, it is yet to be routinely applied to 
large  modern  BFs  [22].  Several  Asian  and  European  countries  are 
developing  technology  for  producing  biomass/biochar  for  use  as  a 
renewable energy source in large modern BFs, i.e., the ULCOS (Ultra--
Low CO2 Steelmaking) project in European Community. 

The four main issues regarding implementation of PBI are: biomass 
resource (including processing), economics, government and company 
policies  and  technical issues.  Technical  solutions  have  been  proposed 
and tested in terms of in-furnace phenomena understanding, materials 
design, facilities design, and operational design and optimisation. 

The resource issues include meeting sustainability criteria, large and 
stable  supply  and  diversity  of  the  resources  employed  (fire  risk).  In- 
furnace phenomena include the turbulent flow with detailed chemical 
conversions. Materials issues include: contamination of raw biomass by 
soil,  low  energy  density  of  raw  biomass,  low  strength  and  density  of 
chars, the grindability of chars, harmful elements, etc. The problems of a 
low density of biomass/biochar are practical and about delivery to the 
tuyere  –  no  doubt  combustion  would  be  excellent.  First,  low-density 
means high volumes for storage and probably low productivity during

covers  the  blowpipe,  inclined  lance,  tuyere,  and  the  raceway  (only 
centreline  part  with  the  diameter  allowing  natural  expansion  of  the 
burning PF plume). Such test rigs have been developed at both bench 
and pilot scales. Bench-scale facilities are typically more productive and 
less expensive to operate. However, the pilot-scale facilities approach in- 
furnace conditions more closely. 

In studies by Silva et al. and Assis et al. [81,108], charcoal showed a 
superior  combustion  performance  compared  with  coals  in  their 
bench-scale PCI test rig across the range of injection rates studied, as 
shown in Fig. 26. In bench-scale studies by Machado et al. [22,84] and 
Barbieri  et  al.  [68],  charcoal  injection  into  BFs  was  predicted  to  be 
feasible because of the low ash and sulfur content, and the high burnout 
obtained below the stoichiometric oxygen/carbon ratio. 

The  pilot-scale  PCI  test  rig  used  in  Mathieson  et  al.’s  study  [27] 
simulated the lance(s), blowpipe and tuyere as well as expansion into a 
simulated raceway cavity that allowed for flame expansion and for some 
recirculation. The burnout of four charcoals was tested and compared 
with PCI coals and found that, under the same conditions, the burnout 
was comparable to or better than the high VM coals studied, as shown in 
Fig. 27. The burnout of the hardwood charcoal studied was 40% (abs) 
higher than the equivalent VM coal, and a similar comparison was found 
for the softwood charcoal. Also, charcoals were found to be superior in 
combustion flame stability with a lower differential pressure across the 
tuyere than the case of coal. These authors demonstrated that another

criterion for suitability. To be suitable, the material must also satisfy the 
HMB constraints of the BF (see Section 4.3). 

A PCI test rig is a more advanced and comprehensive facility for PBI 
testing, as it is designed to closely simulate PCI conditions. It usually

potential  advantage  of  charcoal  is  that  the  characteristics  (especially 
VM) can be optimised during the pyrolysis process. For example, the CV 
can be adjusted to meet the requirement to have a specified raceway 
adiabatic flame temperature (RAFT) without the need to use steam. This 
can  provide  opportunities  to  decrease  bosh  gas  volume  and  increase 
productivity. 

To sum up, PCI test rigs play an important role in the study of PBI, 
while they have not fully simulated the recirculation of biomass particles 
and coke within the raceway or the effects of the surrounding coke bed. 
More  sub-region  simulations  are  expected  to  be  developed  for  a 
comprehensive understanding of PBI. A large investment of both time 
and money is required to develop a test rig. Numerical modelling, which 
has been validated by measurement in the BF or advanced test-rigs, is a 
clear choice for system design that would otherwise be impractical or 
impossible through experimental work. 

Modelling studies 

Modelling method is an effective tool to understand the detailed in- 
furnace phenomena under the harsh, high-temperature, high-turbulent 
and high-pressure environment of PBI. The behaviours of gas-particle, 
such  as  the  temperatures,  pressures,  velocities,  concentrations,  etc., 

can  be  captured  in  numerical  modelling.  Table  13  summarises  the 
application of PBI in pilot or industrial scales and the performance re-
ported in the open literature. 

Wijayanta et al.’s 2D pilot-scale CFD PBI model [67,128] gave the 
in-furnace phenomena of local combustion behaviour within the tuyere 
and raceway centreline, for example, the detailed gas distribution of O2, 
CO2, CO and H2O as shown in Fig. 28. The gas composition is affected by 
the combustion of oak char. The low VM content affects the first igni-
tion, the following VM combustion and thereby the gas composition and 
the increase in the gas and particle temperatures. 

Liu et al.’s 3D pilot-scale CFD PBI model [70] considered the cylin-
drical charcoal particles and an inclined lance. It gave a slightly different 
gas composition (Fig. 29) compared with the above 2D model (Fig. 28). 
This  inclined lance results  in an inclined  particle plume  and  thus the 
asymmetric gas composition. Another difference exists in the H2O con-
tent, which is accumulated in the exit of the lance produced by moisture 
evaporation.  Partial  O2,  CO,  and  CO2  gasification  conditions  produce 
similar  concentration  profiles,  that  is,  rapid  consumption  of  the  O2 
concentration and a rapid increase of CO and CO2  at the downstream. 
This indicates a fast devolatilisation reaction at a low temperature and 
fast char combustion at a higher temperature.

Liu et al.’s 3D industrial-scale CFD PBI model [115] considered the 
cylindrical charcoal particles,  inclined lance and  reactions  in the  sur-
rounding  coke  bed.  The  computational  domain  includes  lance,  blow-
pipe, tuyere, raceway, and the surrounding coke bed regions. The flow 
field of charcoal combustion within the raceway is shown in Fig. 30. An 
inclined  charcoal  plume  is  formed  at  the  lower  part  of  the  raceway 
followed by a large scale of particle recirculation around the raceway 
core.  Fine  particles  disperse  from  the  upper  surface  and  show  higher 
char mass fraction than the lower part of the plume. Along the charcoal 
plume, the burnout increases to 64.13% and the particle temperature 
increases to nearly 3,000 K; whereas in the recirculation, burnout in-
creases  to  nearly  100%,  and  the  particle  temperature  decreases  to 
around 2,000 K. More quantitatively, the evolutions of gas species (O2, 
CO2,  CO),  burnout,  fuel  gas,  the  gas  temperature  along  the  charcoal 
plume are quantitatively showed in Fig. 31. It is found that the charcoal 
particles mainly go through 5 stages along with the distance from the 
lance tip within the blowpipe-tuyere-raceway-coke bed region. 

Different from the detailed results within the raceway above, Fig. 32 
shows the in-furnace phenomena in terms of the whole BF for 200 kg/t- 
HM injections of pulverised charcoal from the CFD PBI model developed 
by de Castro et al. [29], including temperature distributions, streamlines 
of gas and cohesive zone location, hot metal flow pattern and volume 
fractions, and slag flow pattern and volume fractions distributions. The 
injection of pulverised charcoal with oxygen enrichment increases the 
gas volume passing through the dropping zone and enhances the heat 
transfer to move the position of the cohesive zone a slightly upward. The 
pulverised  charcoal  presented  high  productivity,  and  high  ore/coke 
ratio was charged in this region. The slag flow pattern presented similar 
behaviour as for liquid metal, while the slag velocity is an order less than 
hot metal. 

Optimisation of PBI in the raceway 

In addition to injection system design, a modelling study is a cost- 
effective tool for operation optimisation, such as setting blast parame-
ters,  charcoal  preparation  (grinding)  and  blended-fuel  injection.  The 

optimisation is expected to improve burnout in the raceway. 

Optimisation of operating conditions 

Operating  conditions  for  the  raceway  region  typically  include  the 
blast temperature, the oxygen concentration in the blast, blast moisture 
and the injection rate of the pulverised biochar. Several researchers have 
studied the effect of operating conditions on PBI. 

Wijayanta et al. [67,128] used a 2D CFD pilot-scale model to simulate 
and compare the burnout (Eq. 55) of coal and biochar with the injection 
rate  and  different  blast  O2  contents,  in  the  range  of  23-27  wt% 
(Table 12) and 25-200 [(kg solid fuel)/(1,000 Nm3  feed gas)], respec-
tively (Fig. 33). Under the condition of 23 wt% O2 in the blast, biochar 
gave a similar temperature profile to that of coal, suggesting the feasi-
bility of PBI. Higher O2  concentration was found to increase the tem-
perature  and  burnout. This  enhancement was  found to be  limited for 
biochar due to the low VM yield for gas-phase combustion. The biochar 
appeared  to  have  little  impact  on  raceway  operation  at  low  injection 
rates, while it showed a greater decrease in combustibility at high in-
jection rates than coal (biochar of 27.1 wt% VM and coal of 44.60 wt% 
VM).  However,  further  investigation  is  necessary  because  this  2D 
modelling only provided results along the projected tuyere centreline. 
Liu et al. [117] applied a 3D CFD pilot-scale model to investigate PBI 
with  different  temperatures  and  O2  concentrations  of  the  blast;  from 
1373  to  1573  K  and  from  21  to  35  vol%  (Table  12),  respectively 
(Fig. 34). Note, there are different units reported in the studies of the 
effect of oxygen enrichment, namely, wt% and vol% corresponding to 
mass fraction and volume fraction. For comparison, 21.0 vol% (normal 
air) is equivalent to 23.3 wt%. A first derivative graph of the evolution of 
burnout  along  tuyere  centreline  (Fig.  34(a))  was  used  to  analyse  the 
effect of blast temperature. It was found that higher blast temperature 
enhances  biochar  combustion  immediately  downstream  of  the  tuyere 
(burnout in Eq. 15) and there is a second boost beyond 0.5 m from the 
lance tip (before entering the surrounding coke bed). The first peak is 
devolatilisation-dominant 
char 
reaction-dominant.  On  this  basis,  the  high  blast  temperature  signifi-
cantly enhances the char reaction. However, the oxygen enrichment in

the blast is found to enhance biochar combustion throughout the race-
way,  i.e.,  from  of  0.1-0.9  m  from  the  lance  tip.  Both  the  growing 
expansion  of  the  particle  plume  and  the  recirculation  in  the  raceway 
give greater access to O2, contributing to the improved combustion. 

However,  future  parametric  studies  should  consider  the  chemical 
reactions  in  the  surrounding  coke  bed,  which  may  interact  with  the 
raceway. To sum up, modelling studies can provide valuable results at a 

low-cost to test the response of different biochar to various combinations 
of  operating conditions.  This will  require continuous  improvement of 
the models to achieve high reliability. 

Optimisation of biochar preparation 

Specifications  for  biochar  that  are  suitable  as  inject  and  would 
typically include the size distribution, e.g., PF particle size 75% <74 μm,

Performance 
Temperatures of gas and particle in the tuyere and raceway with Oak char were low;The effects of increases in O2 
concentration on the temperatures and the gas concentrations were limited for Oak char; 
The irregularly shaped charcoal particles have a slower combustion process and lower burnouts than those of spherical 
particles;The significant moisture content of charcoal makes the evaporation process obvious at upstream and may delay the 
ignition process for the charcoal injection. 
The combustion profiles of the charcoal and two typical PCI coals are comparable qualitatively, confirming the feasibility of 
charcoal utilisation in PCI technology;The charcoal combustion is delayed by moisture evaporation, resulting in a low final 
burnout of 62.85% at the endpoint of raceway, but a high average burnout of the entire raceway, 83.92%.

and  composition,  e.g., VM,  ash,  moisture  and  CV. Several  researchers 
have studied the effect of biomass preparation on PBI: Wijayanta et al. 
[67,128] numerically studied the particle size of biochar from 40 to 70 
µm, and different biochar (Table 2), as shown in Fig. 35. It was found 
that temperature and reaction fields were sensitive to both combustion 
enthalpy and VM content of the biochar. For example, Oak char 1 (32.09 
wt%VM) showed better combustibility than Oak char (27.10wt% of VM) 
across  the  range  of  conditions  in  the  simulation.  Controlling  particle 
diameter is another way to increase burnout. The particle diameter of 
oak char was required to be 60 μm to obtain the same burnout as coal 
with a particle diameter of 70 μm under the same conditions. 

Similar results regarding the particle size were also found in simu-
lation results from the industrial-scale CFD PBI model [115]. A decrease 
in particle diameter caused earlier devolatilisation and VM combustion 
closer to the lance tip (Fig. 36(a)). The model [115] was also used to 
investigate  the  combustion  behaviour  of  biochar  obtained  using 
different pretreatment temperatures (Table 2). The biochar pretreated 
under different temperatures are found to be able to replace different 
PCI  coals  from  the  view  of  combustion  efficiency.  However,  biomass 
particles are largely simplified in the modelling study both physically 

and chemically. Further improvement of the models is expected, such as 
considering more characteristics of the biomass particles. Since model-
ling studies are cost-effective, more types of biomass and biochar are 
expected to be studied to expand the biomass material database for PBI. 

Co-injection of biomass and coal 

Co-injection  of  biomass  with  coal  could  be  a  transitional  step  to 
achieve full biomass injection in the BF. It may be the fastest way to 
increase  PBI  and  gain  the  economic,  operational,  and  environmental 
benefits.  Biomass  can  replace  one  or  several  components  in  the  coal 
blends,  and  biochar  with  optimised  properties  can  replace  the  coal 
blend. Many advantages of biomass can also be found in the co-injection 
of  biomass  and  coal,  such  as  good  combustibility  [10,27]  and  high 
gasification reactivity [22,84]. It is possible to have biomass and coal be 
co-ground to save on the need to have a separate biomass feed system 
[60]. 

The most common related topics are the combustion behaviour of 
blends,  the  interaction  between  coal  and  biomass,  and  parametric 
studies  of  blending  ratios  and  biomass  types.  Among  these,  the  first 
interesting issue is the possible synergistic interaction between biomass

and coal, which has been reported with conflict results. For example, no 
synergistic effect or interaction was found experimentally for the rice 
husks/coal blends [10], but it was observed for biochar/coal [179]. 

In addition, the synergistic effect may be positive or antagonistic. For 
example, it has been reported that bituminous coal restricts the volati-
lisation  of  biomass,  and  biomass  promotes  the  char  combustion  of

bituminous coal. The activation energies of blends take on a downward 
and then upward trend with an increase in biomass blending ratio [75]. 
Probable  interactions  were  suspected  that  the  mineral  matter  of  coal 
hindered  the  access  of  the  gas  to  the  char  [22,84],  while  alkali 

compounds  catalysed  the  combustion  reactions.  Another  kind  of  syn-
ergetic effect is that biomass is a potential effective reburn fuel when 
coal is used as the primary fuel. Also, flame stability is enhanced with 
biomass/coal  blends,  increasing  its  potential  for  commercialisation

In addition to the experimental studies, modelling studies provide 
information for co-injection operations design and optimisation. A re-
view of co-firing modelling work can be found in Ref. [181], which is 
however based on boilers of different conditions (as listed in Table 1). 
This is one of many cases that provides interesting results that need to be 
treated with caution for application to the BF. A primary issue is how the 
particle phase will be represented. In PCI models, coal/coal blends are 
usually  taken  as  one  particle-phase  either  as  a  continuum  phase  or  a 
discrete  phase.  However,  when  blending  fuels  of  distinctly  different 
characteristics like biomass/coal blends, some aspects can be averaged 
in the particle phase, but some cannot. 

There should be an understanding of not only the parent fuels but 
also the characteristics associated with the fuel blends. For example, de 
Castro et al. [29,174] added charcoal as a new continuum phase with 
new chemical reactions to simulate co-injection of charcoal and coal in a 
BF (Fig. 37). It found that a total of 250 kg/t-HM co-injection of coal and 
charcoal  at  different  ratios  was  possible  to  keep  smooth  BF  practice, 
where  the  best  condition  was  200  kg-coal/t-HM  combined  with  50 
kg-charcoal/t-HM. 

double lances set at different angles for biomass and coal. 

The  third  issue  is  related  to  the  replacement  limit.  Most  biomass 
materials except charcoal were reported with a replacement ratio that 
larger than 1, that is, more than 1 kg biomass is required to replace 1 kg 
PCI coal, which is mainly, but not exclusively due to the lower energy 
density (see Section 4.3 and 4.4). The higher total amount of required 
mass input is required for biomass than that of PCI coal that may cause 
operating problems. 

Currently, there has been insufficient research on the co-injection of 
biomass  and  coal.  Also,  the  alkaline  nature  of  biomass  ash  is  seldom 
considered in PBI models currently. However, the effect of alkaline na-
ture on the combustion of coal and biomass should be considered as the 
related effect becomes significant when biomass blending ratio is large. 

Facility unit design 

Modelling  work  has  also  been  used  for  facility  design,  e.g.,  the 
optimal configuration of the lance, such as the position, angle of incli-
nation, or whether double lances would improve burnout performance. 
The more BF sub-regions included, the greater the capability to accu-
rately reflect actual BF performance with PBI. 

The second issue is design optimisation. Taking the lance configu-
ration as an example, i) a single lance with pre-mixed biomass and coal; 
ii)  a  co-axial  lance  with  different  channels  for  biomass  and  coal;  iii) 

There are conflicting suggestions about lance position. It was sug-
gested that moving the lance tip back or increasing the lance diameter 
favours  burnout  and  particle  dispersion.  Lances  mounted  back  in  the

blowpipe would allow more time for biomass combustion. [182] This is 
because of the limited access to the local oxygen around the biomass 
particles  in  the  raceway,  and  the  extremely  short  residence  time.  By 
adjusting  the  lance  configuration  and  positioning,  the  combusting 
biomass  particle  plume  can  expand  more  in  the  raceway,  improving 
access to oxygen and leading to a higher burnout. However, Wu et al. 
[113] and Shiozawa [183] suggested positioning the lance forward to 
account for the delayed ignition of biochar due to moisture evaporation. 
Note that a forward lance position might shorten the service life of lance 
and tuyere due to overheating and possible radiation. 

Two  types  of  tuyere/lance  configurations have  been  designed  and 
compared in Wu et al.’s CFD model [113], including an annular jet and 
an  intersection  jet,  shown  in  Fig.  38.  An  optimal  lance  position  for 
injecting  charcoal  and  hot  oxygen  into  the  blowpipe  and  tuyere  was 
proposed. From the discussion above, in addition to the general oper-
ating conditions, the customised design and optimisation regarding PBI 
in the specific BFs are highly demanded, i.e., the material preparation 
and  operating  adjustment.  Combining  numerical  modelling  and  lab/-
pilot  experiments,  including  structure  design,  operational  strategy 
design and scale-up, provides advanced understanding, a wide investi-
gation range and cost-and time-effectiveness. 

Double lances are commonly chosen when injecting oxygen/biomass 
or  biomass/coal,  with  suitable  angles  and  positions  for  oxygen  and 
biomass or co-firing of biomass and coal. It has been found that double 
lances could give better heat and mass transfer for combustion and a 
longer service life with only a small modification needed for the blow-
pipe  [113,184–186].  Du  et  al.  [186]  numerically  found  that 
double-lance PCI could allow an increase in the injection rate from 110 
kg/t-HM for the single lance to 153 kg/t-HM by improving burnout. 

However,  it  should  be  noted  that  these  optimisations  regarding 
different materials should be conducted with a target to maintain the 
overall BF HMB within a feasible operating window (see Section 4.3). 

Heat and mass balance (HMB) modelling 

In addition to experimental and CFD studies, HMB modelling is also 
important for designing PBI. In these HMB models [2,40,66,187–189] 
details of in-furnace physical phenomena are not required, and the HMB 
is  established by  considering  the  relevant  chemical reactions  in  more 
general regions (e.g., raceway, belly, shaft) and heat transfer from gas to 
solids throughout the BF. Such models allow the general design of in-
jection to be optimised, such as the maximum injection rate, biochar’s 
potential to replace coke and how much oxygen enrichment is required. 
However, the most important aspect is to identify the window of feasible 
operations with top gas temperature in an acceptable range, no adverse 
effect on productivity and any predicted increase in coke rate producing 
less CO2 than that saved using the sustainable injectant. 

The  potential replacement of  coke  and injected  coal by  biochar is 
most influenced by the heat requirements and the calculations assume 
steady-state BF practice. Using a very detailed and accurate 2-stage BF 
energy and mass balance model, Mathieson et al. [2] conducted a heat 
and mass balance study to estimate BF performance using various bio-
char  (torrefied  wood  and  charcoal  types)  and  potentially  sustainable 
liquid injectants (ethanol, biodiesel), in comparison with conventional 
coal types (from lignite to anthracite). 

The BF was simulated with constant hot metal production, slag ba-
sicity  and  heat  losses,  as  well  as  constant  blast,  hot  metal,  slag  and 
raceway  adiabatic  flame  temperatures.  Flame  temperature  was  main-
tained at the reference case value using oxygen enrichment. The system 
boundary  included  the  BF  proper  and  did  not  include  heating  of  the 
stoves or other effects on plant gas utilisation or electricity production. 
Changes in top gas combustion energy were predicted and reported [2]. 
At an injection rate of 140 kg/t-HM, the study predicted that normal 
low-ash charcoal types have high replacement ratios, producing calcu-
lated decreases in coke and fuel rates of at least 20 kg/t-HM, compared 
with  the  injection  of  a  conventional  high  VM  coal.  The  use  of  some 

biofuels was shown to be limited by the need for high levels of oxygen 
enrichment and the consequent lowering of top gas temperature to un-
acceptable levels. 

For this review, Mathieson [190] has applied the same BF base case 
as previously published [2] to some of the materials listed in Table 2. 
The results are given in Table 14 and Fig. 39. The results are dependent 
on the accuracy of the published proximate and ultimate analyses and 
CVs. Small systematic differences between cases are likely due to the use 
of both ASTM and ISO proximate analysis in the published data. This 
affects ash content. 

The results for the charcoals show that with minor changes to tuyere 
parameters, BF practice is predicted to be very satisfactory; many with 
predicted coke rates less than the reference high-VM coal case. However, 
none of the raw biomass cases has given practical BFoperating results, 
having very low predicted coke replacement rates. Two of the torrefied 
cases (Bamboo and Madagascar Almond) appear to be promising ther-
mochemically. The raw biomass cases show increases in predicted coke 
rates of around 20% and increase overall CO2 emissions by up to 4%. 

Fig. 39(a) shows the correlations of coke rate, coke replacement ratio 
and hot metal production changes with the CV of the injectants, indi-
cating  this  factor  plays  a  key  role  in  determining  the  HMB  results, 
although the scatters show that other factors are also important. 

Other than for the estimation of value-in-use (VIU) where the orig-
inal constraints were applied (see above), all the cases given in Table 14 
were constrained to constant bosh gas volume (BGV) as an indicator of 
changes in production that could be caused by the choice of injectant

(decreases  of  up  to  4%).  Such  changes  would  apply  if  the  BF  were 
already operating at or near maximum production. 

Fig.  39(b)  shows  the  predicted  changes  in  both  total  and  net  CO2 
emissions for the injectants studied. The assumption has been made that 
the biomass and biochar samples are from sustainable resources and that 

these materials do not contribute to net CO2 emissions from the BF. 

Predicted  significant  increases  in  total  CO2  emissions  will  be 
observed for the raw biomass cases and two of the three torrefied cases. 
However, the principal finding is that low ash charcoal types can offer 
up to a 30% decrease in BF net CO2 emissions (excluding the stoves).

Wang  and  Mellin  et  al.  [66,187,188]  developed  a  1D  static,  HMB 
(MASMOD in a Microsoft Excel environment, Fig. 40) to study PBI based 
on a Swedish BF, M3. Three sub-models (BF model, hot blast stove model 
and burden model) were linked, where the burden model balanced the 
required  basicity  and  degree  of  reduction  in  the  BF  model,  and  then 
linked to the hot stove model through the hot blast required. The BF 
model calculated the injection rate required to achieve constant RAFT. 
Two main parameters were found to limit the application of biomass, 
namely the maximum oxygen enrichment of the blast and the minimum 
allowable top gas temperature. As shown in Fig. 41, it was found that the 
charcoal studied could fully replace PCI coal, and torrefied material and 
wood  pellets  could  replace  PCI  coal  by  22.80%  and  20.00%,  respec-
tively. For example, to maintain the constant energy input, 0.456 t of 
charcoal or 1.300 t of dry biomass could replace 0.457 t of PCI coal. 

The potential for reduction in net CO2 emission is the major claim for 
using  PBI.  Wang  et  al.  [66,188]  found  that  the  injection  of  charcoal, 
torrefied material and wood pellets in BFs to replace PCI coal can reduce 
the annual CO2 emissions by about 1,140 t, 260 t and 230 t, respectively. 
Mellin  et  al.  [187]  found  a  CO2  emissions  reduction  potential  of 
1.46-1.82 Mt CO2, or around 25% of the total CO2 (6.6 Mt) emitted by 
the Swedish steel industry in 2008. Also, at 200 kg-charcoal/t-HM it was 
found that most of the emitted CO2 could be absorbed by a forest planted 
for charcoal production [189]. It should be noted that the above specific 
CO2 tonnage reduced was based on the physical amount of CO2, other-
wise emitted by the coal. The leading assumption, which is still disputed, 
in this estimation is that biomass is considered to be completely carbon 
neutral. 

Hanrot  et al.  [40] calculated  a  28%  potential decrease  in  net  CO2 
emissions based on 200 kg/t-HM PBI. Nogami et al. [189] discussed PBI 
using  charcoal  fines  produced  from  the  city  waste  biomass,  and 
concluded that this operation has the potential to reduce more than 30% 
net  CO2  emission  compared  with  the  traditional  ironmaking  process. 
However, issues related to pre-treatment energy consumption and yield 
were not considered in this modelling work. 

Techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment 

Several economic assessments of PBI have found that biomass cannot 
compete with fossil coal/coke on price alone unless the cost of biochar 
can be reduced or there is a price placed on CO2 emissions. Helle et al. 
[50,191]  and  Norgate  et  al.  [192]  have  analysed  the  economics  of 
injecting  dry  biomass/biochar  into  BFs,  considering  costs  of  raw 

materials, energy and CO2 emissions. PBI might be economical when its 
price is below that of coal, the critical ratio of which increased with the 
emission price. Feliciano-Bruzual and Mathews [28,193,194] found that 
up  to  40%  of  CO2  emissions  could  be  achieved  by  PBI.  Besides  the 
apparent ecological benefit, carbon taxes have to be imposed to make 
biochar competitive with coal. Fig. 42 shows the CO2 emission reduction 
of different BFs using PBI, in which the CO2  reduction is 0.28 to 0.59 
t-CO2/t-HM (18.0 to 40.2%) [193]. It is recommended that future work 
will  deepen  the  detail  of  the  descriptions  of  the  system\prime  s  unit 
processes and expand the analysis to include all processes in an inte-
grated steel plant. 

Regarding the cost of different raw materials for PBI, calculation of 
VIU of a candidate material, compared with a known reference material 
is a simple and useful approach to evaluating purchase economics. For

the highest value injectants are also those that produce the greatest CO2 
emissions savings. 

Ref. [195] has a report on the appraisal of a charcoal plant. With VIU 
(*AU$116/t charcoal) taken into account, the net cost of charcoal from 
this  plant  was  projected  to  be  AU$243/t.  The  raw  material  supply 
accounted  for  45%  of  the  overall  operating  cost  of  AU$446/t  at  the 
charcoal plant, while transportation accounted for 16%. The remaining 
39% of the cost was made up of maintenance and interest on capital, 
labour, and utilities. Producing charcoal and supplying it to the iron and 
steel factory is financially viable when all by-product credits and ben-
efits are included. Carbon pricing for charcoal, on the other hand, would 
improve the financial viability of charcoal iron. 

LCA provides a comprehensive assessment of environmental impacts 
associated with all stages of a process chain (“cradle to gate”). There is 
consensus  in  the  literature  regarding  the  potential  for  CO2  emission 
reduction of PBI. Norgate et al. [192,196] applied LCA to find that when 
renewable charcoal completely replaces coals that can save 0.69-1.21 
and 0.91-1.61 kg-CO2/kg-steel with or without the co-product credits, 
respectively,  as  shown  in  Fig.  44.  Mathieson  et  al.  estimated  that  the 
implementation  of  PBI  could reduce  net  emissions  by  0.4-0.6  t-CO2/t 
crude steel (19-25%) [2,197], which was updated to 0.54-0.73 t-CO2/t 
crude steel (24.5-33%) after adding efficiency gains [198]. Fick et al. 
[12] applied a screening LCA with cradle-to-gate system boundaries and 
found  that  an  emission  reduction  was  achieved  between  6.7%  and 
14.7% by PBI (torrefied biomass and charcoal fines) compared with the 
reference scenario with entirely fossil-based reducing agents. Suopaj¨arvi 
et al. [199] calculated CO2  emission reduction of three renewable in-
jectants (charcoal, torrefied wood and bio-SNG) in a Finnish steel plant 
with  a  production  of  2.3  Mt/y).  The  CO2  emission  reduction  without 
by-product credits was 0.99-1.01, 0.40, and 0.84-0.86 Mt/y for charcoal, 
torrefied  wood  and  bio-SNG,  respectively.  This  reduction  would  be 
1.29-1.39,  0.40,  and  0.89-0.97  Mt  if  the  by-product  credits  were 
considered.

PBI, VIU is the “rational purchase price” (say in $/t) for a test injectant, 
such that the hot metal cost remains constant when the test injectant is 
used in place of a reference injectant. Mathieson et al. [2] have calcu-
lated  VIU for a series  of injectants, including biochar,  and Mathieson 
[190]  has  extended  the  previous  study  to  the  materials  shown  in 
Table 14. VIU results depend on many economic factors (e.g., coal, gas 
and electricity prices, by-product credits exchange rates), and vary with 
time. All costs and credits were for 2011 operations in Australia. 

Fig. 43 illustrates the key findings on VIU and net CO2 analysis. The 
results have been sorted in the order of decreasing net CO2  emissions. 
The  raw  biomass  types  and  torrefied  bagasse  have  been  predicted  to 
have  low VIU value, remaining at  50% of the  reference high-VM  PCI 
coal. However, torrefied bamboo and all the charcoals have a higher VIU 
value than the reference high-VM PCI coal, meaning that ironmakers (in

Conclusions: Summary and outlook 

Summary 

PBI  has  gained  increasing  interest  from  the  metallurgical  industry 
and biomass market. It has the potential to help to reduce GHG emis-
sions for the ironmaking industry, and to enlarge the market for biomass 
materials.  This  review  has  provided  insight  into  the  previous  experi-
mental  and  numerical  modelling  studies  relating  to  PBI  and  has  dis-
cussed options for the application of the research to the optimisation of 
PBI  operations.  The  key  contents  have  been  summarised  and  demon-
strated in Fig. 45. 

Raw biomass is generally unsuitable for PBI and thus pretreatment, 
especially the thermal pretreatment, have been discussed based on ef-
fects on the yield and properties of the upgraded products. The prop-
erties of many biomass/biochar materials have been collected, including 
proximate and ultimate analyses, fibre analysis, CV, HGI, etc. Some of 
these biomaterials were selected and examined with an HMB model to 
determine their feasibility PBI utilisation. 

Experimental studies regarding PBI and the developments have been 
summarised and categorised (scale, property). The basic requirements 
for  tuyere  injectants  have  been  grouped  and  analysed,  including 
combustibility, gasification reactivity, grinding and flow performance, 
as well as ash softening and melting characteristics. The behaviour of 
pulverised biomass/biochar particles has been evaluated at the different 
scales  of  the  various  experimental  methods.  The  combustion  study 
methods include TGA, DTF, PCI test rigs, and experimental BFs. 

Modelling approaches and the development and application of cur-
rent CFD PBI models have been reviewed. The choice of sub-models for 
the CFD PBI models has been discussed based on the sub-model’s theory, 
and research needs. The current state-of-the-art CFD models are proving 
to be reasonable, showing a good agreement with experimental data in 
most  of  the  cases.  Also,  they  can  describe  complex  interdependent 
processes  like  fluid  flow,  turbulence,  heat  transfer,  and  the  heteroge-
neous and homogeneous chemical reactions involved in PBI. 

The current CFD PBI models are all steady-state, varying from pilot- 
scale to industrial-scale, and are able to simulate the known in-furnace 

phenomena  in  the  lower  zone  of  the  BF.  They  are  capable  of  being 
used  for  lower-zone  facility  design  and  the  optimisation  of  tuyere 
operating parameters affecting PB combustion efficiency. However, at 
the  current  stage  of  development,  the  overall  feasibility  (operating 
window) and optimisation of BF practice with PBI is best determined 
using HMB modelling. 

The utilisation of DTF and PCI test rigs for PBI has been reviewed, 
including  combustion  efficiency,  offgas  analysis  and  optimisation  of 
operating  parameters.  The  main  components  of  an  HMB  model  have 
been  illustrated.  An  HMB-VIU  model  has  been  used  to  analyse  the 
biomass/biochar collected in this review. Techno-economic analysis and 
LCA are reviewed in terms of the cost of raw materials, energy, and CO2 
emissions. 

Outlook 

Despite the considerable progress made in PBI investigation, there 
remain  some  challenges  and  opportunities  to  pursue  more  profound 
insights  through  experimental  study  and  to  improve  the  numerical 
modelling.  More  attention  needs  to  be  paid  to  solve  the  problems/ 
challenges as summarised Fig. 45.  

• Greater combination of experimental and modelling studies: In order 
to  determine  more  detailed  in-furnace  information,  combustion 
phenomena,  flow  patterns,  proper  mixing  of  the  fuels,  etc.,  an 
experimental investigation using current sensors is not sufficient. PBI 
test facilities at bench-scale or pilot-scale are expected to be designed 
with far greater capabilities to match the modelling insights. 

• Improvement in the description of biomass particles: Although bio-
char has similarities to coal types, they are not true analogues. The 
description of biomass particles is expected to become more distin-
guished from that of coal. For example, the composition of biomass, 
including lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, is expected to be reflected 
both in experimental and modelling studies. In addition, the effects 
of  the  physical  properties  of  biomass  particles  on  momentum  and 
flow patterns are expected to be considered in more detail, such as 
the pores and shapes.

• Improvement  in  the  numerical  sub-models:  Currently,  most  sub- 
models  are  developed  based  on  coal  combustion.  When  they  are 
used for PBI, specific consideration should be applied to improve-
ment.  The  simplifications  and  assumptions  are  expected  to  be 
mitigated.  

• Development  of  new  numerical  models,  including:  i)  Co-firing 
models:  physical  interaction  and  chemical  interaction  are  needed 
to be considered, e.g., the segregation of two injectants with a density 
difference,  the  oxygen  consumption  sequence:  with  different  ki-
netics, the effect of the alkali content of biomass mineral matter on 
the combustion. On this basis, the operating parameters controlling 
are expected to be studied. ii) Transient models: Most current nu-
merical  modelling  typically  defines  activities  of  a  system  to  be  in 
steady-state,  not  in transient  conditions.  This  is  largely limited  by 
computer capability and the related complexity of ironmaking pro-
cess. Transient modelling is in demanding from an industrial aspect, 
to simulate the complex in-furnace phenomena with greater detail in 
a time series. iii) PBI models of the whole BF: Currently, numerical 
approaches are not capable of modelling the whole BF regarding PBI. 
This  is  partially  due  to  the  big  time-scale  difference  between  the 
processes  within  the  raceway  and  those  outside  the  raceway. 
Currently,  simplifying  assumptions  cannot  be  avoided  when 
attempting whole-of-process modelling, and thus the detail of tem-
poral  and  spatial  fluctuations  associated  with  biomass  injection 
cannot be determined.  

• Operations modelling: most HMB and economic models are based on 
BF-PCI operation. However, the difference between biomass and coal 
could  be  reflected  in  the  model  structure  and  parameters.  For 
example, harmful elements like alkalis in biomass products should be 
controlled and minimised to avoid additional coke consumption, the 
formation of wall accretions (scabs/scaffolds) that disturb BF prac-
tice  and  other  negative  impacts  on  the  refractory  materials.  Also, 
there is insufficient understanding of the issue of unburnt biomass, 
such  as  its  effects  on  the  viscosity  of  slag,  and  the  gas-flow 
permeability. 

• CO2  emission calculation: Specific LCA regarding biomass prepara-
tion and PBI will provide more guiding information to the practice. 
This  must  include  the  effect  of  PBI  on  coke  rate  and  overall  CO2 
emissions.  

• Development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models: Providing large 
databases of operating data are available, AI may be suitable for fast 
prediction  of  various  output  variables  without  requiring  detailed 
underlying mechanisms. AI models may be able to describe, predict 
and visualise PBI technology. However, one of the key issues is the 
difficulty in accessing in-furnace data. The combination of CFD and 
AI  is  predicted  to  overcome  these  difficulties  and  realise  fast 
description,  prescription,  and  prediction  of  BF 
in-furnace 
phenomena. 

• Technical and economical challenges for utilising biomass in iron-
making  still  need  to  be  paid  close  attention.  The  compatibility  of 
biomass acquisition, processing, and transport to commercial PBI has 
yet to be determined in many countries, although these have been 
well-established  in  Brazil.  Moreover,  as  environmental  protection 
becomes more stringent and CO2 pricing is considered, the applica-
tions  of  biomass  in  ironmaking  are  exceedingly  broad  during  the 
current transitional period of 30 – 40 years before new near-net-zero 
greenhouse emissions processes are developed and implemented. 

From the review of recent progress in experimental and numerical 
modelling studies, PBI has been predicted to be an effective method to 
realise  stable,  high  productivity,  low-cost  and  low-CO2  ironmaking. 
Considerable progress has already been made to develop PBI technol-
ogy,  and  challenges  and  opportunities  exist  for  further  development. 
This review also sheds light on the research on the injection of other 
promising fuels such as hydrogen [202,206,207,212], semicoke [217, 
222]  into  various  ironmaking  processes  including  BF  [229,230]  and 

COREX [205,210] towards low-carbon ironmaking and sustainable steel 
industry.
