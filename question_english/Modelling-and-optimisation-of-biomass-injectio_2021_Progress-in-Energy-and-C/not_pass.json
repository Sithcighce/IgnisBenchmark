    "question_text": "Based on the provided paper content, how does the particle size distribution (PSD) of pulverized biomass affect its flow performance during pneumatic transportation to the injection lance? What experimental methods are specifically mentioned for evaluating PSD, and how is the conveying gas flow rate related to stable particle conveyance according to the paper?",
    "standard_answer": "The particle size distribution (PSD) of pulverized biomass significantly influences flow performance during pneumatic transportation from grinding mills to injection lances. Proper PSD ensures stable conveyance by preventing sedimentation and line or lance blockage, which are critical operational issues in blast furnace injection systems. The paper specifically states that 'The PSD of biomass is important in understanding its physical and chemical properties, such as ignition and flame structure.' For experimental evaluation of PSD, the paper mentions several measurement methods including sieve analysis, air elutriation analysis, photoanalysis, optical counting methods, electroresistance counting methods, sedimentation techniques, laser diffraction methods, acoustic spectroscopy, and ultrasound attenuation spectroscopy. Regarding conveying gas flow rate, the paper explicitly indicates that 'The conveying gas flow rate should be sufficient to ensure stable conveyance of the particles, avoiding sedimentation and line or lance blockage.' This establishes a direct relationship where the gas flow rate must be carefully controlled - it should be adequate to maintain particle suspension and prevent settling that could lead to operational disruptions, but not excessive to avoid unnecessary energy consumption or equipment wear. The paper also notes that both lean-phase conveying with air and dense-phase conveying with nitrogen have been successfully used for pulverized biomass injection, indicating that different gas types and flow regimes can be employed while maintaining the fundamental requirement of stable particle transport.",
