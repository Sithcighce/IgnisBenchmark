Internal combustion engines (ICEs) are the major consumers of crude oil, and thus improvements in the
fuel consumption performance of ICEs would be significant for global energy conservation and emission
reduction. Owing to the constraints in the engine structure and combustion efficiency, more than half of
the fuel combustion heat in ICEs is wasted. Therefore, ICE waste heat recovery (ICE-WHR) shows huge
potential. Rankine cycle (organic or inorganic) provides a promising solution for ICE-WHR, which could
balance efficiency and practicality. In this review, recent advances in Rankine cycles for ICE-WHR are sum-
marized and discussed. To evaluate results from various existing studies, a uniform evaluation standard,
thermodynamic perfection, was proposed based on the benchmark of the heat source based ideal thermo-
dynamic cycle(H-iCycle), which is determined by achieving ideal thermal matching to external boundary
conditions. Based on this, the effects of three major factors (cycle configuration, working fluid, and key
components) on the performance of Rankine cycle can be investigated. In addition, a discussion of several
application concerns, including backpressure, weight, power output type, off-design performance dynamic
response, and control, enables us to gain a comprehensive understanding and assessment of Rankine cy-
cles in ICE-WHR. With respect to working fluids, C x H y O z and siloxanes with high critical temperature
(such as cyclohexane, benzene, toluene, and MM) have a satisfactory thermal matching with waste heat
sources. Basic Rankine cycles using these working fluids could yield a high thermodynamic perfection of
up to 54.1%. With respect to the cycle configuration, cascade Rankine cycles and dual-pressure Rankine
cycles are expected to achieve the highest thermodynamic perfection of 62.3%. Finally, major challenges
and perspectives for the future development of Rankine cycles in ICE-WHR are discussed. Four promising
research directions suggested in this review include the active design of desirable working fluids, ad-
vanced cycle configuration design based on “energy utilization according to quality,” integrated scheme
research at three levels (component, system, and energy management), and advanced coordinative con-

1. Introduction

Greenhouse  gas  emissions  from  human  activities  exacerbate
global  warming.  The  transportation  sector  is  the  main  contribu-
tor to greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for approximately 14%
of  global  greenhouse  gas  emissions  in  2010  [1] .  Greenhouse  gas
emissions  from  this  sector  are  mainly  generated  by  the  burning
of fossil fuels in internal combustion engines (ICEs) for road, rail,
air, and marine transport. Gasoline and diesel account for 95% of
transportation energy worldwide. In the United States, greenhouse
gases generated by the transportation sector account for approx-
imately 28.9% of total greenhouse gas emissions [2] . For the Eu-
2  emissions  come  from
ropean  Union  (EU),  one-fifth  of  total  CO
transportation, which is the only major sector in the EU for which
greenhouse gas emissions are still rising [3] . As the largest pro-
ducer  and  consumer  of  ICEs  in  the  world,  the  oil  consumed  by
ICEs accounts for 60% of total oil consumption in China. Thus, the
international community has reached a consensus on the need for
improvements in the fuel consumption performance of ICEs.

From the perspective of energy balance, ICE waste heat recovery
(ICE-WHR) shows huge potential. Limited by the engine structure,
combustion efficiency, and heat transfer loss, it is impossible to ef-
ficiently convert combustion heat into shaft power in an ICE. Previ-

ous studies indicated that the brake thermal efficiency is approxi-
mately 30–45% for diesel engines and 20–30% for gasoline engines.
More than 60% of the combustion heat is discharged into exhaust
gas, engine coolant, and so on. Therefore, waste heat recovery is
an effective means to improve the fuel efficiency of ICEs. A techni-
cal report published by Argonne National Laboratory indicated that
waste heat recovery technology exhibits the greatest potential for
ICE performance improvement among various energy-saving tech-
nologies [4] . It is also pointed out by the Europe commission in
Horizon 2020 that “Reduction of CO 2  emissions based on new ICEs
optimized for different combinations using alternative and renewable
fuels with additional energy savings using heat recuperation or plug-
in hybrid ” [5] .

Among existing waste heat recovery technologies, thermoelec-
tric  generators  (TEG),  power  turbines  and  thermodynamic  cycles
have gain much attention. TEGs can directly convert thermal en-
ergy  into  electric  energy  based  on  the  Seebeck  effect.  They  are
expected  to  have  a  simple  structure  and  compact  layout.  How-
ever,  limited  by  current  TEG  materials,  the  conversion  efficiency
of TEGs measured in the existing test benches is still low [6] . As
for  power  turbines,  their  applications  are  appreciated  in  a WHR
systems for heavy-duty engines. The power turbine is installed to
recover waste heat from the exhaust gas downstream of the tur-

bocharger, and it is characterized by its low capital cost, short con-
struction lead time, and high maturity. However, the use of power
turbines may have a negative impact on the engine itself that re-
quires an elaborate control strategy to avoid it [7] . In addition, only
a part of the exhaust gas waste heat can be recovered by this tech-
nique, and a great amount of the heat possessed by engine coolant,
exhaust gas recirculation(EGR) and charge air (CA) cannot be used,
reducing the potential for power turbines. One of the most promis-
ing solutions to exploit the available waste heat is thermodynamic
cycles, including Rankine cycle (organic or inorganic) and Kalina
cycle. Compared to Kalina cycle, which has complex system struc-
ture, high erosion risk and high operating pressure, Rankine cycle
has the advantage of a simple structure, suitable size and volume,
low impact on the engine backpressure, and high reliability, which
is capable of recovering multiple, low, and moderate grade waste
heat streams (e.g., engine coolant and exhaust gas). Previous stud-
ies suggested that Rankine cycles are the preferred heat conversion
technology at the waste heat temperature range of ICEs [8] , pro-
viding an attractive solution to recover waste heat from ICEs that
balances the efficiency and practicality [9] .

The white paper about the US “SuperTruck ” program reported
that Cummins installed an organic RC prototype in a heavy-duty
truck and the test results showed that the brake thermal efficiency
can be increased by 3.6% [10] . Since 2010, Shu’s group has under-
taken a number of projects to explore and demonstrate the pos-
sibility of various RCs on ICE-WHR. Recently, under the China–US
Clean Energy Research Center (CERC), China and the United States
launched a joint research project on high-efficiency medium- and
heavy-duty  trucks.  The  aim  of  this  project  is  to  explore  cost-
effective solutions to achieve a truck efficiency of 50% greater than
a 2016 baseline. In this project, waste heat recovery by means of a
non-refrigerated RC is an important technology to achieve this goal
[11] .

In 1976, the Thermo-Electron Corporation first installed an RC
prototype in a long-haul truck for testing [12] . Since then, many
vehicle manufacturers including Honda [13] , BMW [14] , Hino [15] ,
Cummins [ 16 , 17 ], MAHLE Behr GmbH & Co. [18] , BOSCH [ 19 , 20 ],
Eaton  [21] ,  AVL  [22] ,  Volvo  &  Ricardo  plc  [ 23 , 24 ]  have  also  car-
ried out research and development activities on WHR systems for
commercial vehicles. Meanwhile, many studies have been devoted
to the theoretical analyses of ICE-WHR based on RCs, covering cy-
cle configuration identification, operating parameter optimization,
working fluid selection, component design, dynamic characteristic,
economic evaluation, and other limiting factors.

There  have  also  been  reviews  focusing  on  RCs  for  ICE-WHR.

selection, and expander design of RCs for ICE exhaust heat recov-

nology for ICE-WHR since the 1970s. This paper focused on the ex-
pander  and  working  fluid  selection.  Lion  et  al.  [27]  provided  an
overview  of  RC-WHR  to  utilize  various  waste  heat  sources  from
heavy-duty diesel engines (HDDEs), paying particular attention to
the multiple engine operation profiles for various typical vehicle
applications. Zhou et al. [28] presented a review of technological
development of organic RC-WHR in on-road passenger cars from
the aspects of RC architectures, working fluids, and components.
Chintala et al. [29] focused on compression ignition engines and
reviewed major research advances in RCs with respect to working
fluids, expanders, heat exchangers, back pressure, and performance
analysis. Recently, Xu et al. [30] provided a preliminary introduc-
tion to organic RC-WHR in HDDEs, covering a broad range of top-
ics.

Previous reviews on RCs in ICE-WHR were conducted using only
simple collections, categorizations, and summaries of existing stud-
ies.. Owing to the differences in external boundary conditions, such
as  heat  source  or  cold  source,  obvious  inconsistencies  might  be
encountered when directly comparing and evaluating the results
from various studies, which become the main obstacle to gaining
a deep understanding of certain key factors that affect RC perfor-
mance. Thus, in this review, special emphasis is placed on defin-
ing a uniform evaluation standard with a benchmark of the ideal
thermodynamic cycle, which is customized by achieving an ideal
thermal matching to external boundary conditions. Based on this
approach, this paper critically reviews the recent progress in filling
the gap between the ideal thermodynamic cycle and basic Rankine
cycles (B-RCs) with respect to the working fluid, cycle configura-
tion, and key component aspects. In addition, a discussion of appli-
cation concerns enables us to gain a comprehensive understanding
and assessment of RCs in ICE-WHR. This review covering the major
progress on the working fluid selection, cycle configuration design,
key component development, and application evaluation of RCs in
ICE-WHR would be highly valuable.

The main objective of this review is to systematically analyze
the  working  fluids,  cycle  configurations,  and  key  components  of
RCs  based  on  the  uniform  thermodynamic  evaluation  standard,
which  sheds  light  on  the  optimization  of  RCs  for  ICE-WHR.  The
major  challenges  and  previous  effort s  in  the  aspects  of  working
fluids, cycle configuration, key components, and practical applica-
tions are discussed. Suggestions and perspectives based on the au-
thors’  theoretical  and  engineering  experience  are  presented.  The
remainder of this article is structured as follows. Section 2 presents
the definition of the ideal thermodynamic cycle and the thermo-
dynamic  evaluation  method;  Section  3  and  Section  4  give  com-
prehensive evaluations of the working fluids and cycle configura-
tions of RCs in ICE-WHR, respectively; Section 5 presents the ma-
jor progress on key components (expanders, heat exchanger, and
pump); Section 6 discusses the impact of several negative effects
and complications on system performance in practical operation.
Finally, Section 7 discusses major challenges and research opportu-
nities.

2. Thermodynamic evaluation methodology

2.1. Available waste heat sources

ICEs  always  have  multiple  waste  heat  sources  available  for
thermal-power conversion by RCs. The energy distribution is dif-
ferent for various applications of ICEs. For diesel engines used for
heavy-duty trucks, exhaust gas from the exhaust pipe and engine
coolant are the main waste heat sources. For turbocharged diesel
engines,  a  turbocharger  is  powered  by  exhaust  gas  to  compress
the  intake  air.  During  this  process,  the  exhaust  gas  temperature
decreases, and a portion of waste heat is rejected in the form of
intercooling heat of the intake air. A diesel engine with exhaust

gas  recirculation  (EGR)  is  operated  by  recirculating  a  portion  of
the exhaust gas back to the engine cylinder, causing a decline in
the amount of waste heat possessed by the exhaust gas. Thus, the
main waste heat sources of heavy-duty truck application ICEs are
exhaust gas, engine coolant, intake air, and EGR gas [ 30 , 31 ]. The
characteristics of these waste heat sources for typical supercharged
and intercooled HDDEs are summarized in Table 1 .

Similarly, by an optimistic evaluation of a vehicular gasoline en-
gine,  less  than  one-third  of  the  combustion  energy  can  be  con-
verted  into  mechanical  power,  with  one-third  of  the  energy  be-
ing  discharged  in  the  exhaust  gas  and  another  one-third  being
wasted by the engine coolant [ 14 , 32 ]. Generally, gasoline engines
exhibit  relatively  low  compression  ratios  (6–12)  in  comparison
with  diesel  engines  (12 ∼22),  leading  to  lower  ICE  thermal  effi-
ciency  and  higher  exhaust  gas  and  engine  coolant  temperatures
(see Table 1 ).

As  for  maritime  ICEs,  there  are  four  waste  heat  streams  that
can be utilized for WHR technology: exhaust gas, engine coolant,
scavenged air, and lubricating oil. Among these, exhaust gas pos-
sesses a large amount of waste heat and its temperature varies in
the range of 325–345 °C for two-stroke diesel engines, and 400–
500 °C for four-stroke diesel engines [33] . Moreover, the tempera-
tures of scavenged air at the intercooler inlet and engine coolant
are  within  the  ranges  of  100–160 °C  and  70–125 °C,  respectively.
Generally, the low temperature of the lubricating oil gives it less
potential to be exploited by RCs. However, lubricating oil was dis-
cussed as a promising low-temperature waste heat source in Ref.
[34] . In a comprehensive energy distribution analysis of maritime
application ICEs, Mondejar et al. [35] pointed out that exhaust gas
is the most promising waste heat source for RCs. The combined use
of exhaust gas and engine coolant could achieve a desirable sys-
tem performance with annual fuel savings of 10%. Compared with
engine  coolant,  the  amount  of  heat  in  scavenged  air  is  strongly
related  to  the  engine  load,  making  it  less  effective  as  the  heat
source for ships sailing under medium and low loads. Hence, en-
gine coolant is more attractive than scavenged air.

Apart from gasoline and diesel, gaseous fossil fuels are currently
playing an increasingly important role. Gaseous ICEs can be fueled
with compressed natural gas (CNG), coalbed methane, shale gas,
and natural gas hydrate. It is their efficiency, low emissions, and
longer-term availability that make gaseous fuel drives so attractive.
A gaseous fuel engine can be used as the primer engine of a sta-
tionary distributed energy system (DES) [36] or in an automotive
application such as city buses in an urban area [ 37 , 38 ]. From an
energy distribution assessment for a typical gaseous fuel engine,
exhaust gas and engine coolant are the most promising waste heat
sources, which are considered in the majority of existing studies
[ 36 , 37 ]. Waste heat rejected in an intercooler is also included in
Ref. [ 38 , 39 ] for a greater performance improvement.

Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the main waste heat
sources  available  for  Rankine  cycles  in  various  ICE  applications.
There are obvious differences among waste heat sources in terms
of quality and quantity. The quality of waste heat is generally de-
termined by the temperature. From the perspective of energy qual-
ity in Table 1 , the exhaust gas, including EGR gas for truck diesel
engines, shows the most potential as a waste heat source and can
be easily recovered. Because of this, the majority of existing and
developing Rankine cycle prototypes in ICE-WHR are driven by ex-
haust gas, EGR gas, or a combination of exhaust gas and EGR gas.
From  a  quantitative  perspective,  exhaust  gas  and  engine  coolant
are the most promising heat sources, which together account for
almost  50%  of  the  fuel  combustion  energy.  The  exclusion  of  en-
gine coolant causes a significant loss of WHR potential. However,
the huge temperature difference between exhaust gas and engine
coolant makes them difficult to be used efficiently and simultane-
ously, which is one of the hot topics of theoretical research. More

heat  sources,  as  well  as  the  energy  quantity.  Thus,  the  latter  is
more suitable for analysis in Rankine cycle in the ICE-WHR field.
The  proposed  H-iCycle  is  a  theoretical  ideal  thermodynamic  cy-
cle, which has the maximum efficiency possible of a heat engine
(WHR-RCs) allowed by thermodynamic laws. The H-iCycle is con-
structed based on the assumption of no irreversible loss in the heat
transfer process, compression and expansion process, and the as-
sumption of the absence of incidental wasteful processes such as
friction and leakage. Therefore, it can absorb heat from the heat
source  through  the  high-pressure  curve  and  release  heat  to  the
cold source through the low-pressure curve. No temperature dif-
ferences exist in the heat transfer process as shown in Fig. 1 . The
proposed H-iCycle is of great significance as it sets a limit on the
power  output  of  actual  WHR-RCs.  The  net  power  output  of  the
ideal thermodynamic cycle can be obtained as follows.

First, the total entropy transferred from the heat source to the

broadly,  this  has  become  a  major  challenge  for  RCs  for  WHR  in
many fields, namely, how to efficiently utilize multiple waste heat
sources with large temperature differences. The current review will
offer insight into the progress on this issue in the ICE-WHR appli-
cation, which also provides a reference for other industrial fields.

2.2. Evaluation method based on thermodynamic perfection

In this evaluation method, an ideal thermodynamic cycle should
be  defined  firstly  and  the  efficiency  ratio  of  the  actual  cycle  to
the ideal one would be calculated to evaluate its performance. The
Carnot cycle is always defined as the ideal cycle, which has an up-
per limit of efficiency according to the heat and cold source. How-
ever, the Carnot cycle has two isothermal process, which is inca-
pable for multiple and finite-heat-capacity waste heat sources pro-
vided by the ICEs, meaning that the Carnot cycle may no longer be
a very effective tool for system evaluation and optimization guid-
ance. Therefore, a heat source based ideal thermodynamic cycle(H-
iCycle) is presented as a substitute for the Carnot cycle, under mul-
tiple and finite-heat-capacity heat sources. The construction pro-
cess of the ideal thermodynamic cycle is described below.

Using the visualization method of the t–q diagram, the H-iCycle
based on a single finite-heat-capacity heat source is presented in
Fig. 1 . Compared with the temperature-entropy ( t-s ) plot which is
widely used in previous researches, the temperature-capacity ( t-q )
plot is capable of indicating the energy quality of various waste

wherein t is the local temperature in the high-pressure curve of
the H-iCycle. Because the H-iCycle is an internal reversible cycle,
there is no entropy generation during the cycle process. Therefore,
the entropy extracted from the heat source is equal to the entropy
deposited into the cold source, as expressed in Eq. (2) .
s in = s out

(2)

Thus, the heat ejected from the H-iCycle into the cold source
can be obtained as Eq. (3) and the total net power output is esti-
mated by Eq. (4) .

Pinch analysis, also known as process integration, is a mature
technique  to  integrate  and  optimize  a  heat  exchanger  network,
which is also used in energy conversion cycles, such as heat pump
cycles [46] , refrigeration cycles [47] , and organic RCs [ 4 8 , 4 9 ]. Using
pinch analysis techniques, multiple heat sources may be combined
into a composite curve. This is achieved by summing the enthalpy
flow rates over any given temperature range.

From the heat source analysis of various ICE applications, ex-
haust gas and engine coolant are the representative heat sources
and  the  main  subjects  for  ICE-WHR.  Exhaust  gas  is  a  high-
temperature heat source, which features a large temperature drop,

2.3. Basic Rankine cycle (B-RCs) and research gaps

Having  determined  the  H-iCycle,  the  gap  between  B-RCs  and
the H-iCycle is expected to be illustrated clearly. B-RCs are defined
in this paper as single-loop RCs using traditional refrigerants (CFCs,
HCFCs,  and  HFCs)  as  working  fluids.  A  B-RC  comprises  four  ba-
sic processes including pressurization, evaporation, expansion, and
condensation  processes.  The  evaporator  configuration  is  strongly
related  to  the  number  and  quality  of  heat  sources  selected,  as
shown in Fig. 4 . A single evaporator is adopted for the case with a
single waste heat source ( Fig. 4 a). As more heat sources are con-
sidered, these heat sources can be connected in series ( Fig. 4 b) or
in parallel ( Fig. 4 c).

Schematic  t–q  maps  based  on  the  heat  sources  of  exhaust
gas  and  engine  coolant  (in  series)  are  displayed  in  Fig.  6  to
demonstrate  the  differences  among  various  cycle  configurations
and working fluids. In this way, other studies with single and mul-
tiple heat sources can be also considered and discussed.

Fig.  5  shows  a  schematic  t–q  diagram  of  typical  B-RCs  us-
ing R245fa for ICE-WHR (see Ref. [48] for the detailed formation
process of the t–q diagram). Unlike the ideal thermodynamic cy-
cle,  temperature  differences  during  the  heat  transfer  process  in
both the heat and cold sides are required in the consideration of
the reasonable time and heat transfer area. Furthermore, the irre-
versible loss of turbomachinery (turbine and pump) should not be
ignored in reality. These effects all contribute to the imperfection
of B-RCs.

From the thermal matching aspect, Fig. 5 clearly displays the
dramatic  gap  between  the  H-iCycle  and  B-RCs.  The  three  major
thermal mismatching zones are the (1) high-temperature thermal
mismatching (Zone 1) caused  by the  low cycle  temperature and
pinching  limit  at  the  exhaust  gas  heat  exchanger  exit,  (2)  low-
temperature thermal mismatching (Zone 2) caused by the inade-
quate use of the low-temperature heat source, and (3) cold side
thermal mismatching (Zone 3) caused by the high condenser inlet
temperature. This suggests that B-RCs could approach the H-iCycle
by  improving  these  thermal  mismatches  incrementally,  which  is
also the subject of this review.

Systematic design in thermodynamics has three primary con-
cerns,  as  shown  in  Fig.  6 .  First,  based  on  waste  heat  source  in-
formation, a prescreening of working fluids from the database is
required according to the selection criteria, such as safety and en-
vironmental concerns and cost. Then, a proper cycle configuration
should be determined; single or multiple heat transfer exchanger
networks and single or multiple stage expansion configurations can
be designed. Finally, key components, principally heat exchangers
and turbomachinery, should be optimized and designed according
to the cycle configuration and working fluid. In this review, a sig-
nificant emphasis is placed on these three aspects. This paper crit-

capacity heat sources).

whereas engine coolant is a low-temperature heat source with a
small temperature drop. Taking these two heat sources as an ex-
ample, Fig. 2 demonstrates the combination process of the com-
posite  heat  source  curve  in  the  t–q  diagram.  Then,  a  similar
method could be employed to determine the H-iCycle and calcu-
late the ideal net power output, as shown in Fig. 3 .

For the purpose of facilitating the evaluation, thermodynamic

perfection is defined as follows:

Thermodynamic perfection =

W net , act
W

net , ideal

(5)

W net,act is the net power output obtained from various cases in
published studies and W
net,ideal is the net power output of the H-
iCycle. In the following analysis, the raw data collected from the
cited  publications  include:  heat  source  parameters  (temperature,
mass flow rate, and specific heat), cold source parameters (temper-
ature), and cycle performance(net power output). Thermodynam-
ics perfection of the Rankine cycle can be calculated according to
Eqs. (1 –5 ). Prior to the discussion on the thermodynamic perfec-
tion of various cycle configurations and working fluids, some basic
assumptions are made:

1. The acid dew point temperature of exhaust gas, if not given in

the studies, is set at 120 °C.

2. The cold source temperature, if not given in the studies, is set

to the ambient temperature.

3. The constant-pressure specific heats, if not given in the studies,
are estimated as 1.1 kJ/kg ·°C for exhaust gas, 4.1 kJ/kg ·°C for en-
gine coolant, 1.0 kJ/kg ·°C for intake air, and 1.1 kJ/kg ·°C for EGR.

3. Working fluid

Working fluid selection is a critical issue for RCs in ICE-WHR.
Owing  to  the  characteristics  of  waste  heat  sources  provided  by
ICEs, certain specific requirements should be considered during the
selection process. A suitable working fluid has a significant effect
on the system thermodynamic performance, plant size miniatur-
ization, manufacture of key components, and cost.

The following selection criteria are commonly used for RCs in

ICE-WHR:

Thermodynamic properties: The physicochemical properties of
a  working  fluid  that  influence  the  RC  thermodynamic  or
thermo-economic  performance  are  the  working  fluid  type
(dry, wet, or isentropic), critical temperature (pressure), spe-
cific heat, condensation latent heat, molecular weight, boil-
ing temperature, density, viscosity, and so on.

Safety:  nonflammable,  nontoxic  (low  toxicity),  noncorrosive,
good material compatibility, and good chemical stability to
withstand the operating temperature range.

Environmental properties:  low or no impact on the environ-
ment, low ozone depletion potential (ODP), and low global
warming potential (GWP).

Other concerns: availability and cost.

There is a clear consensus that it is difficult to find a single fluid
that can satisfy all of the above requirements, and thus a complex

critical)

ically reviews the recent progress in filling the gap between the
H-iCycle and B-RCs with respect to the working fluid, cycle con-
figuration, and key component aspects. In addition, a discussion of
several application concerns enables us to gain a comprehensive
understanding and assessment of the RC in WHR- ICEs.

trade-off should be made when selecting working fluids on a case-
by-case basis [50] .

3.1. Traditional refrigerants

Traditional  refrigerants  as  working  fluids  in  RCs  refer  to
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), and
hydrofluorocarbons  (HFCs),  which  are  widely  used  in  low-  to
medium-temperature applications (e.g., solar and geothermal ap-
plications).

3.1.1. Pure substance

The selection and comparison of traditional refrigerants is a key
topic  for  B-RCs  with  a  single  exhaust  gas  as  a  heat  source  (see
schematic diagram in Fig. 4 a). General analysis methods and in-
dicators include: an energy analysis based on the first law of ther-
modynamics (net power output W net , thermal efficiency η
th , etc.)
[ 50 , 51 ],  exergy  analysis  based  on  the  second  law  of  thermody-
namics (exergy destruction I , exergy efficiency ηex  , etc.) [ 51 , 52 ],
techno-economic analysis (capital cost, electricity production cost
( EPC ), depreciated payback period ( DPP ), etc.), and component size
analysis (heat exchanger area A , size parameter of turbine ( SP ), vol-
umetric flow ratio (VFR), etc.) [53] .

Shu  et  al.  [51]  presented  a  multi-approach  evaluation  system
(MA-ES)  covering  energy,  exergy,  and  techno-economic  analyses,
which  indicated  that  R123  and  R245fa  exhibit  excellent  perfor-
mance  in  the  above  three  aspects.  Larsen  et  al.  [50]  proposed
an application methodology based on natural selection, concern-
ing energy analyses, boundary conditions, hazard levels, and en-
vironmental concerns. Among traditional refrigerants, R245fa and
R236ea are feasible in marine applications, with low hazard and
desirable  efficiency  at  reasonable  pressure.  Through  energy  and
exergy  analyses,  Wang  et  al.  [54]  pointed  out  that  R11,  R141b,
R113, and R123 showed slightly high thermal efficiency and low
exergy destruction (see Fig. 7 ). However, R245fa and R245ca are
still the most suitable working fluids for WHR-RCs  if safety and
environmental  impact  are  considered.  Jung  et  al.  [55]  indicated
that R245fa is the optimal working fluid for vehicle applications,
with high efficiency and environment-friendly characteristics. With
respect  to  the  techno-economic,  environmental,  and  safety  as-
pects,  Yang  et  al.  [52]  indicated  that  R245fa  is  the  best  choice
for  ICE-ORC  in  comparison  with  R1234yf  and  R1234ze,  whereas
Douvartzides et al. [56] claimed that R32 is the most appropriate
among  37  working  fluid  candidates  in  marine  applications.  Tian
et al. [57] conducted a comprehensive comparison of 20 working
fluid candidates (boiling point temperatures ranging from −51.6 to
32.05 °C) for waste heat recovery from a commercial diesel engine,
and concluded that R141b, R123, and R245fa always exhibit a desir-
able thermal efficiency performance, net power output, and elec-

tricity production cost. A similar selection was made in a recent
study by Zhu et al. [58] . The recommended traditional refrigerants
are summarized in Table S1 [ 50–52 , 56–63 ] in the Supplementary
Materials.

The studies mentioned above were conducted under constant
ICE  operational  conditions,  whereas  RCs  powered  by  waste  heat
from  ICEs  often  operate  under  partial-load  conditions  owing  to
the changes in engine load. The engine load effect should not be
ignored when comparing and selecting working fluids [53] . Joshi
[64] and Kanchibhotla [65] conducted a comparison among water
and traditional refrigerants (R245fa, R113, R124, and R134a) with
various  engine  loads,  which  indicated  that  water  exhibits  better
performance than other refrigerants under heavy engine load, but
fails to produce any power at low engine load. On the contrary,
refrigerants cover a wide range of engine load. Shu et al. [59] ana-
lyzed the effect of marine engine load on ORC performance among
seven working fluids and concluded that R123 can produce more
power output at heavy engine load, whereas R365mfc is suitable
for light engine load. An experimental comparison between R245fa
and R123 also showed that R123 is advantageous for heavy duty of
ICEs, whereas R245fa is preferable for light and medium duty [66] .
As summarized above, R245fa is the most popular refrigerant
used as a working fluid for ICE-RCs. In 2010, Oak Ridge National
Laboratory [67] designed and developed an R245fa-based RC pro-
totype, which was coupled with a 1.9 L light duty diesel engine
and  achieved  a  combined  peak  brake  thermal  efficiency  of  45%.
Ghilvacs et al. [68] indicated that a maximum reduction of 10% in
brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) was achieved by an R245fa-
based RC on a 1.5 L diesel engine (80 kW). In consideration of var-
ious engine conditions, Andwari et al. [69] reported that the BSFC
of a diesel engine (10.5 L) was observed to decrease by approx-
imately 2–5% using an R245fa-based RC over a wide engine load
range. Zhao et al. [70] concluded that an R245fa-based RC achieved
a reduction in BSFC of up to 3.61 g/(kW h). Cipollone et al. [71] as-
sessed an R245fa- based ORC prototype coupled with a HDDE and
achieved a thermal efficiency of 10%, which is similar to the results
in Ref. [ 72 , 73 ]. Furthermore, R245fa as working fluid is compared
with water [ 74 , 75 ], R123 [76] , and R134a [77] .

Apart  from  R245fa,  other  refrigerants,  including  R123,  R141b,
R113, R11, and R32, are also recommended for single-exhaust gas-
powered RCs. Thus, several scholars also focused on further analy-
ses of R123 [78] , R113 [ 79 , 80 ], R11 [81] and R134a [82] . However,
with the growing concern about environmental issues, CFCs (such
as R11 and R113) were banned completely by 2010, whereas HCFCs,
including R123, R141b, etc., are planned to be put aside in the near
future. With respect to HFCs, although R245fa and R134a cause no
harm  to  the  atmospheric  ozone  layer,  they  do  contribute  to  the
greenhouse effect and climate change owing to their high GWPs.

Recently,  novel  environmentally  friendly  refrigerants,  such  as
R1234yf [ 62 , 83 ], R1233zd [ 84 , 85 ], and R1234ze [86] have attracted
more  attention  as  substitutes  for  R245fa.  A  theoretical  compari-
son conducted by Yang et al. [83] showed that R1234yf exhibits
a satisfactory economic performance. The experimental results re-
ported by Guillaume et al. [84] confirmed that R1233zd is superior
to R245fa in recovering exhaust gas waste heat from a truck diesel
engine. For marine applications, Lümmen et al. [86] presented that
R1234ze appears to be the most promising working fluid in com-
parison with R1234yf and R1234zd.

As another potential heat source for ICE-WHR, engine coolant
from large-scale ICEs (marine applications [87–89] or large-scale
stationary ICEs [90] ), is also exploited as a single heat source for B-
RCs. Pure refrigerants (R134a[89], R245fa [87] , and R124 [91] ) and
a refrigerant mixture (SES36 [90] ) are considered as suitable work-
ing fluids for such low-temperature heat sources.

For small-scale ICEs such as vehicular ICEs, engine coolant ap-
pears  to  have  less  potential  to  be  utilized  alone.  A  comparative
analysis  conducted  by  Boretti  et  al.  [92]  indicated  that  RCs  fit-
ted on the engine coolant from a 1.8 L gasoline engine exhibit an
increase in fuel conversion efficiency of 2.8%, versus 6.4% on ex-
haust gas. A reasonable integrated solution is to connect the engine
coolant and exhaust gas in series and use the engine coolant as a
preheating source (as shown in Fig. 5 b). Ma et al. [63] compared
two RC modes utilizing exhaust gas and engine coolant with three
common refrigerants (R123, R245fa, and R141b). The first mode is
based on the full utilization of exhaust gas, and the second is based
on the full utilization of engine coolant. The results showed that
with the optimal refrigerant of R141b, the first mode achieved 3–
4% higher improvement in ICE efficiency than the second mode.
A  combined  R123-based  RC  system  was  presented  by  Zhu  et  al.
[93] for both exhaust gas and engine coolant from a 1.98 L gaso-
line engine, achieving a fuel efficiency improvement of 4.7–5.8%.
Similar R123-based RCs in Ref. [94] obtained a reduction in fuel
consumption of 11.73% for a 12 L diesel engine. R245fa was also
adopted to recover both exhaust gas and engine coolant, and the
thermal efficiency of a diesel engine was improved by 6.1% [95] . A
thermo-economic analysis conducted by Yang et al. [62] indicated
that R1234yf performed better than R245fa in terms of the pur-
chase cost and net power output index.

For an HDDE with EGR technique, EGR holds great promise for
recovery. Teng et al. [96] claimed that it is possible to improve the
HDDE fuel efficiency by 5% through recovering the waste heat of
EGR.  As  high-quality  heat  sources,  EGR  and  exhaust  gas  can  be
configured  in  series  (seeing  Fig.  4 b)  or  in  parallel  (see  Fig.  4 c).
The major advantage of a series configuration is its simple con-
trol, and no complicated equipment is needed to control the flow
rate [97] , whereas the superiority of parallel configuration lies in
its low pressure drop in the working fluid side and preferable cy-
cle performance [98] . Among refrigerants, Pradhan et al. [97] con-
cluded that R123 and R245fa gave optimal system performance in
a series configuration. The most commonly used working fluid in
RCs for both exhaust gas and EGR waste heat recovery is ethanol,
which will be discussed later.

3.1.2. Mixture

To break the thermodynamic limitation of pure working fluid
and pursue better performance, zeotropic mixtures comprised of
two  or  three  refrigerants  have  been  considered  for  RCs  in  ICE-
WHR. The temperature glide of zeotropic mixtures in evaporation
and condensation processes favors a better thermal matching with
the  heat  source  (sink),  and  results  in  a  desirable  system  perfor-
mance  [99] .  However,  excessive  temperature  glide  may  induce  a
composition shift and fractionating of the zeotropic mixtures, re-
sulting in output power loss. Thus, it is difficult to draw a gen-
eral conclusion that mixtures are more desirable than their pure

components  [ 100 , 101 ];  further  optimization  and  assessment  are
required  before  mixtures  are  applied.  Yang  et  al.  [60]  examined
eight zeotropic mixtures for an ORC system in ICE-WHR and con-
cluded that R402B (R125/propane/R22, 0.38/0.02/0.6 by mass frac-
tion) achieved the maximum net power output. Aiming at a large
marine diesel engine, a techno-economic performance comparison
between pure refrigerants and their mixture was conducted in Ref.
[61] . The results showed that the payback period of the RC system
using R600/R1234ze is shorter than those using R600 and R1234ze
by 9% and 9.17%, respectively.

3.1.3. Discussion and challenges

Owing to the exclusion of CFCs and HCFCs, some common HFCs
(R245fa, R245ca, R134a, R236fa, and R236ea), new environmentally
friendly  refrigerants  (R1234yf,  R1234ze,  and  R1233zd),  and  their
mixtures are discussed in-depth using the concept of thermody-
namic perfection.

Table 2 and Table 3 present the main thermodynamic proper-
ties and thermodynamic perfection analysis results of these refrig-
erants, respectively. Fig. 8 demonstrates the thermodynamic per-
fection of various refrigerants with respect to the exhaust gas tem-
perature. R245fa is observed to have been studied in a broad range
of  exhaust  gas  temperature  (160–695 °C).  The  analysis  results  of
other refrigerants are also presented, however, the limited data do
not allow for any trend analyses. Therefore, R245fa, as the repre-
sentative traditional refrigerant, is found to achieve a thermody-
namic perfection in the range of 20.7–34.2% for B-RCs fueled by a
single exhaust gas, and 19.4.2–35.1% for B-RCs fueled by both ex-
haust gas and engine coolant. Furthermore, the analysis results also
suggest that a better thermal matching can be achieved with a low
exhaust gas temperature.

One of the key bottlenecks for the application of traditional re-
frigerants in ICE-WHR is their low thermal decomposition temper-
ature (for instance, 250 °C for R245fa). To avoid the thermal decom-
position of refrigerants caused by local overheating, an intermedi-
ate heat transfer cycle was added between the working fluid and
the exhaust gas in previous studies [ 73 , 102 ]. However, the addition
of an intermediate cycle requires more components and a compli-
cated system modification, resulting in additional exergy loss.

Returning to Fig. 5 , the maximum cycle temperature is limited
by  the  decomposition  temperature  of  the  refrigerant,  inducing  a
serious thermal mismatch in the high-temperature zone (Zone 1).
Additionally, traditional refrigerants with low critical temperature
have  low  evaporating  pressure,  wihch  also  lead  to  a  poor  ther-
mal matching [103] . Furthermore, the environmental impact asso-
ciated  with  traditional  refrigerants  presents  a  major  obstacle  for
their large-scale application in ICE-WHR.

3.2. C x H y O z & Siloxanes

Based on the above analysis, it is reasonable to speculate that a
better performance can be obtained by increasing the cycle tem-
perature.  The  drawbacks  of  traditional  refrigerants  motivate  re-
searchers  to  explore  more  appropriate  working  fluids  for  high-
temperature applications. Thus, C x H y O z  and siloxane have gained
significant popularity. The C x H y O z included in this review can be
categorized into hydrocarbons, alcohols, and a ketone. A schematic
comparison  between  traditional  refrigerants  and  C x H y O z  is  dis-
played in Fig. 9 . C x H y O z as a working fluid could operate at a high
cycle temperature, improving the thermal matching in the high-
temperature zone (Zone 1) and holding promise to achieve a better
system performance.

fluids is available in the open literature, but no single working fluid
could  be  defined  as  an  optimal  one.  Shu  et  al.  [109]  compared
ten alkanes, including n-alkanes, iso-alkanes, and cyclo-alkanes, in
a B-RC fueled by exhaust gas from a diesel engine. Six indicators
are employed for parameter optimization, and the main results are
shown in Fig. 10 . The simulation results showed that cyclo-alkanes
produced  more  power  output  and  less  irreversible  loss  than  n-

alkanes and iso-alkanes. Apart from cyclo-alkanes, the alkanes with
large molecular weight obtained preferable thermodynamic perfor-
mance,  but  they  require  a  complicated  turbine  construction  and
design.  This  conclusion  is  consistent  with  the  theoretical  results
in Ref. [ 110 , 111 ]. There is an obvious controversy concerning the
comparison  of  results  between  alkanes  and  aromates.  Lai  et  al.
[112] employed alkanes, aromates, and linear siloxanes as working

fluids for B-RCs with maximum temperatures of 250 and 300 °C,
thereby confirming cyclopentane as an optimal working fluid for
all the studied cases. Another direct comparison among 56 work-
ing fluids was reported by Rijpkema et al. [105] . The comparison
results indicated that cyclopentane behaved better than benzene.
Conversely, simulation results by Neto et al. [113] indicated that
benzene, toluene, and acetone are superior to both n-alkanes (oc-
tane, heptane, etc.) and cyclo-alkanes (cyclohexane).

Owing to its desirable thermodynamic performance, nontoxic-
ity, and low cost, ethanol has gained significant popularity in WHR
from HDDEs for commercial trucks, especially in RCs powered by
EGR or EGR/EG. Amicabile et al. [106] indicated that ethanol pro-
vided  a  preferable  solution  to  WHR-RCs  for  automotive  HDDEs
in  terms  of  system  performance  and  capital  cost.  Grelet  et  al.

[98] also concluded that ethanol exhibited a good performance in
comparison with butane and certain siloxanes (MM, MDM, etc.),
which is recommended for automotive applications. From the as-
pect of expansion machines, experimental results obtained by Se-
her et al. [20] showed that a piston expander and turbine are suit-
able for ethanol-based RCs in commercial vehicles. Another exper-
iment was conducted by Dolz’s group to demonstrate the potential
and feasibility of ethanol-based RCs using a swash-plate expander
on a 2.0 L gasoline engine, achieving an increase in ICE mechanical
efficiency of 3.7% with an expander isentropic efficiency of 38.5%
[ 114 , 115 ]. As for ethanol-based RCs to recover waste heat from both
EG and EGR, a parallel configuration ( Fig. 4 c) behaved better than
a serial configuration ( Fig. 4 b) [98] . AVL [116] reported the experi-
mental results of a serial-configured RC system coupled with a 10.8

The  final  analysis  results  showed  that  the  appropriate  fluids  are
five  C x H y O z  (n-hexane,  n-octane,  acetone,  toluene,  and  ethanol)
and MDM. With the power output as an indicator, many working
fluids were evaluated by Rijpkema et al. [105] . Acetone, cyclopen-
tane, methanol, ethanol, and benzene are recommended for their
satisfactory performance. Additionally, Shu et al. [36] conducted a
comprehensive comparison among four C x H y O z , two siloxanes and
four traditional refrigerants, finding that the C x H y O z and siloxanes
could  produce  more  power  output  with  less  heat  transfer  area.
However,  a  complicated  multiple-stage  expander  is  required,
which  causes  a  high  cost  investment.  For  low-molecular-weight
hydrocarbons  (such  as  butane,  isobutane  and  isopentane),  a
thermo-economic  comparison  by  Yang  and  Yeh  [104]  indicated
that  butane  and  isobutane  had  slightly  lower  thermal  efficiency
but shorter payback periods than R1234ze. Isopentane and butane
may present the comparable net power output with R245fa [52] .

L Cummins diesel engine, demonstrating fuel savings of 3–5%. Us-
ing similar ethanol-based RCs, fuel consumption reductions of 4.7%
for a 12.4 L diesel engine and 4.8% for a 10.7L diesel engine were
reported by Yang et al. [117] and Joshi et al. [118] , respectively. The
reported fuel consumption reductions are all in a range of 3–5%,
which shows the boundaries for ethanol-based RCs in automotive
applications.

For marine applications, a number of researchers [ 127 , 135 , 136 ]
have reported that benzene is the best working fluid for maximum
net  power  output.  Mondejar’s  group  [ 127 , 137 ]  integrated  a  B-RC
system into a passenger vessel and identified benzene for maxi-
mum net power output. An analysis based on operational profile
data over a round trip showed that nearly 22% of the total power
demand could be provided by the benzene-based RCs system.

Performance  comparisons  among  traditional  refrigerants,
C x H y O z ,  and  siloxanes,  have  also  received  considerable  critical
attention.  Owing  to  the  obvious  performance  differences  among
C x H y O z  and siloxanes, it is difficult to draw a general conclusion
that C x H y O z and siloxanes are superior to traditional refrigerants.
From a summary of previous studies, large-molecular-weight hy-
drocarbons, siloxanes, alcohols, and ketones outperform traditional
refrigerants  [ 106 , 108 ].  However,  no  obvious  advantages  can  be
found  for  low-molecular-weight  hydrocarbons  [ 52 , 120 ].  Michos
et al. [138] proposed a working fluid selection procedure for B-RCs
coupled  with  marine  diesel  engines,  based  on  environmental,
safety,  usage,  and  thermodynamic  requirements.  Eight  working
fluid  classes  are  considered,  including  hydrocarbons,  traditional
refrigerants,  inorganic  fluids,  alcohols,  siloxanes,  and  mixtures.
Table 5 presents the main requirements and selection procedure.

terials.  It  is  convincing  that  C x H y O z  and  siloxanes,  which  can
be  heated  to  high  temperatures,  enable  B-RCs  to  approach  the
H-iCycle.  However,  one  of  the  main  challenges  remaining  for
C x H y O z  and  siloxanes  is  the  security  risk  associated  with  their
flammability. For automobile applications, it has been proven that
hydrocarbons  are  technically  viable  for  low-capacity  automotive
air  conditioners  of  vehicles  [139] ,  which  also  demonstrates  the
possibility  of  using  hydrocarbons  for  WHR-RCs  in  automobile
applications.  In  spite  of  this,  reliable  sealing  and  necessary  ven-
tilating  devices  are  still  required  to  prevent  release.  Regarding
marine  applications,  WHR-RCs  with  flammable  working  fluids
require  installation  in  a  separate  room  from  the  marine  power
plant, thus increasing the system complexity and capital cost [35] .
Additional  costs  from  safety  concerns  are  ignored  in  previous
studies.

3.2.2. Mixture

To  alleviate  the  safety  issue  encountered  with  C x H y O z  and
siloxanes,  several  attempts  have  been  made  to  apply  mixtures,
comprised  of  C x H y O z  (siloxanes)  and  retardants,  to  suppress  the
flammability. From a thermodynamic perspective, by mixing two
or  more  pure  substances  with  different  properties,  it  is  possible
to customize a new working fluid with appropriate properties to
satisfy the requirements of ICE-WHRs. According to the difference
in the temperature glide range, mixtures can be categorized into
azeotropic  and  zeotropic  mixtures.  Zeotropic  mixtures  have  re-
ceived more attention in existing studies. The main reason is that
the non-isothermal phase change of zeotropic mixtures provides a
chance to achieve desirable thermal matching between the cycle
and heat source (sink). Detailed literature surveys on mixtures as-

sociated with C x H y O z  and siloxanes are summarized in Table S3
[ 123 , 124 , 126 , 140–144 ] in the Supplementary Materials.

Possible  retardants  that  suppress  the  flammability  of  C x H y O z
and siloxanes include water, traditional refrigerants, and CO
2 . The
first attempt for RCs in ICE-WHR was reported in 1976 using Flu-
orenol 50 (Fluorenol/water: 50%/50% by mass) as a working fluid
[12] . By thermal management optimization, component modifica-
tion, and control improvement, a 12.5% reduction in fuel consump-
tion was reported for a long-haul truck [140] . Alcohols are miscible
with water, and thus water can be ideal retardant for alcohols. AVL
[96] and VOLVO [24] devoted efforts to using alcohol–water mix-
tures in RCs in truck applications. Traditional refrigerants are also
viable  retardants  and  have  been  extensively  used  to  blend  with
hydrocarbons [123] and siloxanes [145] . Moreover, recent studies
have suggested that blending hydrocarbons with CO
2  is effective
in suppressing their flammability [146] .

In  general,  only  mixtures  with  the  optimal  composition  ra-
tio  may  exhibit  better  performance  than  their  pure  components
[100] . Thus, it is a crucial problem to determine optimal compo-
sition ratio for a specific application. Shu et al. [123] adopted R123
and R11 as retardants for three pure hydrocarbons (cyclopentane,
cyclohexane,  and  benzene).  Fig.  11  shows  the  evolution  of  ther-
mal efficiency with the mass fraction of retardants. With the in-
crease  in  the  mass  fraction  of  retardants,  the  thermal  efficiency
increases first and then decreases. They concluded that mixtures
are capable of obtaining higher thermal efficiency than their pure
component  counterparts  at  the  optimal  composition  ratio.  Opti-
mal  benzene/R11  (0.7/0.3  by  mass)  mixtures  can  improve  ther-
mal efficiency by 7.12–9.72% in comparison with pure benzene. A
similar idea is also implemented in large-scale marine ICEs [124] .
Zeotropic mixtures, comprised of hydrocarbons (benzenes, cyclo-
hexane, and toluene) and traditional refrigerants (R11 and R134a)
are  used  to  recover  waste  heat  from  exhaust  gas  and  engine
coolant.  Simulation  results  demonstrated  that  cyclohexane/R141b
(0.5/0.5)  performed  better  than  the  other  substances,  providing
a  13.3%  increase  in  net  power  output  compared  to  pure  cyclo-
hexane. Different from previous works, Fang et al. [126] observed
the thermodynamic and thermo-economic performance of RCs us-
ing  toluene/decane  and  toluene/R245fa  mixtures.  Toluene/decane

(0.9/0.1 by mass) is defined as the optimal mixture, but it cannot
markedly improve the system performance.

The  flammability  characteristics  of  these  mixtures  have  also
been studied. One fundamental criterion to evaluate the safety of
a substance is the flammability limit. Generally, the flammability
limit  can  be  divided  into  two  parts:  the  lower  flammable  limit
and the upper flammable limit. These refer to the minimum and
maximum concentrations, respectively, of a flammable substance
in  air  for  which  flame  can  propagate,  as  shown  in  Fig.  12 .  (a).
When adding the retardant into the flammable substance, the up-
per flammability limit decreases and the lower flammability limit
increases,  finally  intersecting  at  the  fuel  inertization  point.  The
area surrounded by the upper and lower flammability limits is the
flammable  zone,  whereas  the  rest  is  the  non-flammability  zone.
Using CO
2 as the retardant for hydrocarbons, experimental results
by  Tian  et  al.  [147]  indicated  that  the  upper  flammability  limit
of  propane,  butane,  pentane  and  isopentane  decreased  by  27.2%,

25.9%, 25.4%, and 21.7%, respectively. Using traditional refrigerants
as retardants, Zhao et al. [148] conducted an experiment to study
the  inert  effect  of  R134a  and  R227ea  on  the  flammability  limits
of  hydrocarbons  and  presented  the  nonflammable  zone  of  these
mixtures ( Fig. 12 (b)); they concluded that the nonflammable zone
expands  as  the  number  of  nonflammable  components  increases.
Based on experimental data, several theoretical models based on Le
Chatelier’s formula [149] , flame temperature theory [146] , and adi-
abatic flame temperature [150] have been proposed to accurately
predict the flammability limit.

Returning  to  Fig.  9 ,  on  one  hand,  C x H y O z  working  fluids
with high critical temperature could effectively improve the high-
temperature  thermal  matching  (Zone  1)  by  increasing  the  cycle
temperature. On the other hand, they also have a high pressure
ratio thus resulting a high turbine outlet temperature (shown in
Fig.  9 ),  leading  to  a  poor  cold  side  thermal  matching  (Zone  3).
Moreover, fluids with high critical temperature have been proven
to behave badly in heat recovery from a low-temperature engine
coolant (utilization rate < 10%) [110] . A large amount of waste heat
possessed by the engine coolant remains unused.

3.2.3. Discussion and challenges

Fig. 13 shows a summary of C x H y O z , siloxanes, and their mix-
tures  in B-RCs  for ICE-WHR  in the  open literature.  C x H y O z ,  pre-
sented in Fig. 13 , cover a wide range, including hydrocarbons, alco-
hols, ketone, and their mixtures, with a critical temperature range
of 135–344 °C. Overall, C x H y O z are observed to achieve thermody-
namic perfection ranging from 24.1% to 54.1%. Siloxanes results are
also presented, but the limited data do not allow any conclusions
to be drawn on possible trends. Fluids with high critical tempera-
ture (such as cyclohexane, benzene, toluene, and MM) have better
thermal matching and higher thermodynamic perfection compared
to the fluids with low critical temperature (isobutane, butane, pen-
tane, etc.).

Recently, a considerable body of research has developed around
2 -based RCs in high-temperature application fields
the theme of CO
[151] . Rwin and Moullec [152] claimed that a CO
2 -based RC would
be beneficial in improving the efficiencies of a wide range of ther-
mal power plants and estimated that using CO
2 to replace steam
in power cycle could be up to 30% more efficient. Echogen Power

tricity, indicating that supercritical CO

posed by Choi [156] to recover waste heat from the engine coolant
and intercooler, thereby achieving a thermal efficiency of 7.87%.

Third, CO

2 contributes to the miniaturization and simplification
of the WHR plant [ 153 , 154 ]: CO
2  turbines are expected to be ef-
ficient,  small,  and  simple.  The  high  density  and  volumetric  heat
capacity of supercritical CO
2 make it energy-dense, which is con-
ducive  to  reducing  the  turbine  and  pump  size.  Previous  studies
[152] indicated that the power output of a three-stage steam tur-
2  turbine (as shown
bine could be achieved by a single-stage CO
in Fig. 16 ). Fewer control valves are needed in a CO
2 power plant,
contributing to a reliable operations. Additionally, owing to its low

viscosity, a heat exchanger for supercritical CO
by structural innovation (such as with a microchannel heat transfer
printed circuit heat exchanger (PCHE) [157] , etc.) and heat transfer
enhancement (such as by metal foam [158] ).

CO

2  also  presents  fast  dynamic  responses  to  highly  transient
heat sources from automotive applications. Shu’s group [ 159 , 160 ]
conducted an experimental investigation on a CO
2 -based RC pro-
totype to examine the system’s dynamic response to external per-
turbations. The dynamical test results indicated that CO
2 -based RC
showed smooth transitions and quick responses, and could oper-
ate robustly with narrow fluctuations of the heat source. Li et al.
[161]  investigated  the  transient  performance  of  a  CO
2 -based  RC
powered  by  waste  heat  from  an  HDDE.  Simulations  under  three
typical  operating  modes  (startup  mode,  power  mode,  and  stop
2 -based RC is robust and reliable in op-
mode) confirmed that CO
eration to withstand transient temperature fluctuations. Moreover,
the preheating process, provided by engine coolant with less fluc-
tuation,  is  proven  to  be  beneficial  to  continuous  power  output
[162] .

3.3.2. Mixture

The deployment of CO

2 /R134a  mixture  and  CO

2 -based RCs for ICE-WHR, especially for
automotive applications, faces two major challenges. First, the CO
2 -
based RC is supposed to operate at high pressure, increasing the
safety risk, control difficulty, and capital cost. Second, CO
2  has a
relatively low critical temperature, meaning that it is difficult to
condense into a liquid state (transcritical cycle) or to cool to near
the critical point (supercritical cycle) by an ambient cooling source.

2 /R134a mixture
(0.6/0.4 by mass) and tested it in a small-scale RC test bench pow-
ered  by  a  truck  diesel  engine.  An  experimental  comparison  be-
tween  a  CO
2  indicated  that  the  former
could produce 23.3% more net power output than the latter (see
Fig. 17 (a)). After a shutdown of the refrigerating unit in the test
bench, the power cycle could still operate steadily under an am-
bient  cooling  source  ( Fig.  17 (b)),  confirming  that  the  CO
2 /R134a
mixture could expand the range of condensation temperature. At
the ambient source condition, a 1.9% thermal efficiency improve-
ment could be gained for the diesel engine combined with such a

applications for truck diesel engines, and defined CO
2 /R32 (0.3/0.7)
and CO
2 /R161 (0.45/ 0.55) as optimal mixtures. By using these two
mixtures, the optimal operating pressure was observed to decrease
by 36% and 35%, respectively, compared to pure CO

cle temperature, and it has good thermal matching in the high-
temperature zone  (Zone  1).  Moreover,  another  advantage of  CO
2
embodied in Fig. 14 is the  coordinating utilization capability for
both high-temperature (exhaust gas) and low-temperature (engine
coolant) waste heat [154] , which improves the thermal matching
in the low-temperature zone (Zone 2).

As a promising technology for ICE-WHR, the major advantages
of CO
2 is a natural sub-
stance with less impact on the environment, low price, no hazard
to humans, and no flammability risk. CO
2 also has desirable ther-
mal stability to withstand high exhaust gas temperature.

Second,  supercritical  CO

2  can  efficiently  use  both  high-
temperature and low-temperature waste heat, which is attributed
to its low critical point (31.1 °C, 7.21 MPa). The specific heat of a
supercritical fluid reaches a peak at a certain temperature, called
the pseudocritical temperature. Owing to the relatively low critical
temperature, the peak of the specific heat is located in the range
of heat recovery from engine coolant, as shown in Fig. 15 [154] .

3.4. Summary

Advantages  and  disadvantages  of  traditional  refrigerants,
2  are  listed  in  Table  6 .  The  traditional
C x H y O z, siloxanes,  and  CO
refrigerant-based  RC  is  a  relatively  mature  technology,  which  is
used in a wide range of thermal power plants, such as geothermal,
solar,  and  industrial  WHR  plants.  However,  its  application  in
ICE-WHR  faces  major  obstacles:  environmental  issues,  unreliable
operation  due  to  poor  thermal  stability,  and  unsatisfactory  per-
formance.  C x H y O z  and  siloxanes  and  CO
2  may  partially  alleviate
the  above  problems,  while  introducing  new  issues,  such  as  the
flammability  of  C x H y O z  and  siloxanes  and  cooling  of  CO
2 .  There
have been recent attempts to explore the feasibility of zeotropic

mixtures  based  on  C x H y O z  and  siloxanes  or  CO
them with retardants to suppress the flammability, hydrocarbons
are  observed  to  achieve  better  performance  [ 123 , 124 , 141 ].  CO

mixtures are also proven to be a promising solution to alleviate

which also provide an opportunity for the active customization of
the  working  fluid,  rather  than  a  passive  selection  to  satisfy  the
requirements. Additionally, unconventional working fluids, such as

2  is capable of efficient operation
with both high-temperature and low-temperature heat source, its
system performance is not desirable, as reflected by the thermo-
dynamic perfection in the range of 15.2–17.2%. This phenomenon
is attributed to its low expansion ratio, resulting in a low enthalpy
drop during the expansion process and poor thermal matching in
the cold side (see in Fig. 14 ). A large amount of heat is available

aided  molecular  design  (CAMD)  methods  [166] ,  should  also  be
explored in future work.

Extensive research has shown that no single existing fluid can
satisfy all the requirements of Rankine cycles for ICE-WHR. In the
last decade, there has been an increasing interest in the computer-
aided molecular design (CAMD) based Rankine cycle working fluid
screening method. The basic chemical groups of the working fluid
are determined from fundamental substances, and the group in-
formation is used to generate and search a vast number of con-
ventional or novel molecular structures to identify the molecules
that offer the best performance concerning the properties of in-
terest [ 167 , 168 ]. Papadopoulos et al. [169] first used a systematic
CAMD method based on the group contribution method to select
pure working fluid for ORC, determined the relationship between
working fluid properties and cycle performance, and extended the
methodology to the application of binary working fluid mixtures
[170] . The major advantage of CAMD is that it provides an oppor-
tunity to realize the integrated optimization of the working fluid,
process,  equipment,  and  cycle  system  [171–173] .  Recently,  there
have been a few studies that applied CAMD method for Rankine
cycles in ICE-WHR field. Preißinger et al. [174] screened approxi-
mately 72 million chemical substances provided by the PubChem
database by applying the COSMO-RS method and evaluated them
in real mobile applications. This study significantly broadens the
scope of the working fluid screening and reveals unconventional
working fluids for Rankine cycles. Aiming at the transient behav-
ior  of  ICE  waste  heat  source,  Schilling  et  al.  [175]  proposed  in-
tegrated  design  frameworks,  which  link  the  working  fluid  selec-
tion to the process design, called the 1-stage CoMT-CAMD method.
The author concluded that the optimal identified working fluid by
this method outperforms the commonly used conventional work-
ing fluid. Previous studies, however, have failed to comprehensively
satisfy  the  various  requirements  of  Rankine  cycles  for  ICE-WHR
(e.g., system performance, component miniaturization, dynamic re-
sponse, safety, etc.). Thus, further research is required to establish
multi-objective integrated systematic design methods for Rankine
cycles in ICE-WHR field.

4. Cycle configuration

This section presents a review of the open literature related to
cycle configuration modifications, using B-RCs as the benchmark.
These  configuration  modifications  are  proposed  and  designed  to
improve  thermal  matching  in  both  the  hot  and  cold  sides  of  B-
RCs, as shown in Fig. 6 . Likewise, the fundamentals and necessity
of these modifications can be clearly explained and illustrated with

Returning  to  the  B-RCs  shown  in  Fig.  5 ,  Fig.  9 ,  and  Fig.  14 ,
a  high  expander  outlet  temperature  results  in  cold  side  ther-
mal  mismatching  (Zone  3),  especially  for  C x H y O z  and  siloxanes
in Fig. 9 and CO
2  in Fig. 14 . A large amount of heat is available
to be reused. For the B-RCs fueled by both engine coolant (low-
temperature heat source) and exhaust gas (high-temperature heat
source), the temperature difference between the working fluid and
the exhaust gas is excessive, owing to the pinch point limitation at
the engine coolant inlet. Decreasing this thermal mismatch could
be accomplished by raising the working fluid temperature at the
exhaust gas heat exchanger inlet. Thus, several scholars suggest a
regenerator, located before the exhaust gas exchanger, to recuper-
ate vapor sensible heat after the expander ( Fig. 19 ). Taking C x H y O z
working  fluids  as  examples,  Fig.  20  illustrates  the  performance
benefits of the addition of a regeneration process, indicating that
a regenerator is beneficial to  improve thermal matching in both
the cold and heat source sides.

Fig.  21  presents  the  results  of  the  thermodynamic  perfection
of the regenerative RCs (R-RCs) in open publications. The regen-
erator  fundamentally  improves  the  performance  of  B-RCs  and  is
widely  used  in  the  existing  prototypes  or  test  benches  [ 67 , 176 ].
Lu et al. [177] compared four ORC layouts and demonstrated that
R-RC achieves the best overall energy efficiency improvement. By
integrating R-RC, the energy efficiency of a 0.638 L diesel engine
can be improved by 8.0% at the engine’s rated condition. The ef-
fect of the regenerator was also discussed by Liu et al. [48] , who
investigated an 8.4 L diesel engine. By adding a regenerator, the
thermal efficiency of the B-RC increased from 9.76% to 11.69%. Re-
garding the working fluid, the positive effect of using a regenerator
for dry working fluids is more obvious than that for wet working
fluids [ 122 , 178 ]. It is also reflected in Fig. 21 that no obvious per-
formance gain for ethanol can be observed by adding a regenerator.
For an efficient use of both engine coolant and exhaust gas, Kim
et al. [32] proposed a novel R-RC, including a low-temperature re-
generator and a high-temperature regenerator, and indicated that
a 20% additional power output can be obtained by such a system
with a 3.3 L gasoline engine.

In addition to the benefits, the negative effects of adding a re-
generator include an additional capital cost and increased pressure
drop. Vaja et al. [107] pointed out that the regenerative process
required liquid–gas heat exchangers with a complex structure and
high  heat  transfer  area,  increasing  the  capital  cost  of  the  whole
system. Amicabile et al. [106] conducted a comprehensive evalua-
tion of the effect of the regenerator and working fluid, leveraging

The  pressure  ratio  of  a  CO

2 -based  RC  is  relatively  small  and
a  huge  amount  of  heat  could  be  utilized  (as  shown  in  Fig.  14 );
thus, the regenerative process has a strong influence on the CO
2 -
based  RC,  as  reflected  in  Fig.  21 .  Shu  et  al.  [154]  presented  an
improved  CO
2 -based  cycle  by  adding  a  regenerator.  An  increase
of up to 150% in net power output can be achieved. Meanwhile,
the regenerator also contributes to reducing the exergy loss of the
whole system. The authors confirmed that the regenerator plays a
2  systems compared to their counter-
more important role in CO
part (R123). These results were verified by their following experi-
ment [42] . In the regenerator, the specific heat of CO
2 in the cold
side is approximately three times larger than that in the hot side.
Thus, part of the regeneration heat cannot be used by traditional
regeneration method. Song et al. [179] proposed a split regenera-
tion method, which includes a high temperature regenerator and
a low temperature regenerator. CO
2  from the compressor is split
into  two  streams,  where  one  stream  flows  through  a  preheater,
and the other streams flow through the low-temperature regener-
ator. These two streams are combined to be further heated in the
high-temperature regenerator. By doing this, a deeper utilization of
regeneration heat can be achieved and 7.4% more power could be
obtained in comparison with traditional R-RCs.

4.2. Cascade-based modification (C-RCs)

From  Fig.  20 ,  it  can  be  found  that  even  with  the  improve-
ments  afforded  by  the  regenerative  process,  a  large  amount  of
low-temperature waste heat possessed by the engine coolant still
remains unused. From the cycle configuration aspect, introducing
a  low-pressure  loop  in  B-RCs  to  ensure  a  part  of  the  working

thermodynamic and thermo-economic indicators. They found that
B-RCs may perform better than R-RCs in consideration of the min-
imum capital cost. However, as the tradeoff between performance
gain and capital cost, a payback period reduction is still expected
when a B-RC is equipped with a regenerator [104] . As for the pres-
sure drop, Kim et al. [32] highlighted that the pressure drop in-
crease caused by the regenerator would offset the increased net
power output. For instance, a 2% pressure drop in the regenerator
may lead to a 5.3% net power loss.

ids in subcritical and transcritical modes, respectively. Wang et al.
[37] proposed a regenerative supercritical–subcritical C-RC to re-
cuperate exhaust gas and engine coolant from a compressed nat-
ural gas (CNG) engine. Combined with C-RCs using R1234zd and
R1234yf as a working fluid pair, the BSFC of the CNG engine could
be reduced by approximately 40 g/kWh and the thermal efficiency
would be enhanced by 10–14% (as shown in Fig. 24 ). Applying the
cascade concept into marine applications, Song et al. [ 190 , 191 ] ob-
served  similar  C-RCs  on  a  marine  diesel  engine  and  determined
water and R236fa to be the optimal pair. The maximum net power
output by this C-RC could reach 115.1 kW, leading to an 11.6% in-
crease in power output for the original engine.

Although  there  have  been  many  theoretical  evaluations,  the
work devoted to the experimental analysis concerning the C-RCs
has been rare. Yu at al. [41] constructed a C-RC test bench, consist-
ing of a water-based HT loop and R123-based LT loop, to recover
waste heat from the exhaust gas of a heavy-duty engine. The au-
thors conducted an experimental comparison between C-RCs and
OS-RCs (a thermal oil storage loop was added to transfer heat from
the exhaust gas to working fluid without power output) as engine
load increases from 60% to 100%. C-RCs can obtain an increase in
power output of up to 5.6% over that of the original diesel engine,
and a 3.2% increase in power output in comparison with OS-RCs.

Other waste heat sources, such as intake air and EGR, can also
be  utilized  by  C-RCs.  Yang’s  [ 39 , 197 ]  group  presented  a  C-RC  in
which the HT cycle recovers heat from an exhaust gas, while the
LT cycle absorbs heat from the intake air, the condensation heat
of  the  HT  cycle,  and  the  engine  coolant  in  sequence.  Based  on
the  optimization  results,  a  regenerator  is  added  in  the  HT  cycle
in the existing cycle configuration to improve the system perfor-
mance [199] . The analysis results indicated that the C-RC enables
the original engine to increase its thermal efficiency by 13% and
reduce its BSFS by 4%. Recently, Shu et al. [ 40 , 200 ] utilized all four
waste  heat  sources  (exhaust  gas,  engine  coolant,  intake  air,  and
EGR) from HDDEs with a complicated C-RC. The HT cycle is de-
signed to absorb heat from the exhaust gas and EGR, while the LT
cycle is set to recover heat from the intake air, engine coolant, and
condensation heat of the HT cycle, exhaust gas, and EGR after the
HT cycle. Up to a 16% increase in thermal efficiency, compared to
the original engine could be obtained. However, a long deprecia-
tion payback period (approximately 7.8 years) remains an obstacle
for its application.

4.3. Dual-pressure cycle-based modification (D-RCs)

Another way to combine the HT and LT cycles is by using dual-
pressure RCs (D-RCs), as shown in Fig. 25 . One of the layouts of
D-RCs  is  the  separate  expansion  D-RCs  shown  in  Fig.  25 (a).  The
working  fluid  is  divided  into  two  streams;  one  of  the  streams
is pumped to a relatively high pressure to absorb heat from the
high-temperature heat source, while the other stream is pumped
to  a  low  pressure  to  recover  the  low-temperature  heat  source.
The  high-pressure  and  low-pressure  loops  operate  as  individual
RCs  through  the  evaporation,  expansion,  and  condensation  pro-
cess.  For  the  separate  expansion  D-RCs,  the  high-pressure  loop
and low-pressure loop can employ different or same working flu-
ids. Another layout is the confluent expansion D-RCs, as shown in
Fig.  25 (b).  The  primary  difference  between  these  two  layouts  is
that,  in  confluent  expansion  D-RCs,  the  working  fluid  of  the  HT
cycle after the HP expander and the working fluid of the LT cy-
cle after the evaporating process mix together, and then expand
through the LP expander. Thus, only one working fluid is needed
for  confluent  expansion  D-RCs.  From  the  thermodynamic  aspect,
as shown in Fig. 26 , the main feature of D-RCs is that the working
fluid of the HT cycle expands to a low pressure instead of an in-
termediate pressure in C-RCs. As a direct consequence, irreversible

fluid evaporates at relatively low temperature, is likely to allevi-
ate this issue [180] . One of the possible solutions is cascade RCs
(C-RCs). Fig. 22 shows a schematic diagram of typical C-RCs. Gen-
erally, C-RCs comprise a high-temperature cycle (HT-cycle) and a
low-temperature cycle (LT-cycle). The HT-cycle and LT-cycle oper-
ate  as  individual  systems  and  are  connected  by  an  intermediate
heat exchanger, which is used to transfer the condensation heat
of the HT-cycle to the LT-cycle. From the thermodynamic aspect
in Fig. 23 , C-RCs achieve a highly desirable low-temperature ther-
mal matching (Zone 2), implying that C-RCs are much closer to the
H-iCycle. In C-RCs, the HT-cycle and LT-cycle could be B-RCs or R-
RCs in subcritical or transcritical modes. As for the working fluid,
the HT-cycle and LT-cycle could use traditional refrigerants, C x H y O z
and siloxanes, or CO
2 as a working fluid. An overview of the main
research results related to C-RCs is provided in Table S4 [ 14 , 36–
41 , 48 , 145 , 181–199 ] in the Supplementary Materials.

The first attempt to apply C-RCs for ICE-WHR was reported by
BMW in 2008. BMW [14] proposed a C-RC prototype with water
as the HT-cycle working fluid and ethanol as the LT-cycle working
fluid to enhance the thermal efficiency of vehicular ICEs. The ex-
perimental results indicated that more than 10% additional power
output can be obtained by applying the C-RC concept, which also
demonstrated that this system could be mounted in a vehicle in
an appropriate package. After that, a number of studies have ap-
plied  C-RCs  in  heavy-duty  trucks  [145]  and  marine  applications
[ 182 , 194 ]. Aiming at a 235.8 kW diesel engine, Shu’s group con-
ducted a comprehensive optimization and evaluation of C-RCs to
determine  the  optimal  working  fluids  [186–188]  and  cycle con-
figuration  [185] .  Results  indicated  that  water  [185]  and  toluene
[188] possessed the best thermodynamic performance in the sub-
critical and transcritical HT cycles, respectively. For the LT cycle,
R1234yf [187] and R143a [186] are the most suitable working flu-

cle and the LT cycle are be avoided. An overview of the D-RCs in
open literature are provided in Table S5 [ 34 , 45 , 48 , 94 , 121 , 201–208 ]

parison among six cycle configurations using exhaust gas and en-
gine coolant as the heat sources. The results indicated that the D-
RC outperforms the others with a higher net power output and less
heat transfer area.

Previous studies suggest that D-RCs may exhibit better perfor-
mance than C-RCs in the aspects of net power output [ 48 , 204 ] and
system footprint [205] . In consideration of technological practical-
ity, Panesar [204] presented a D-RC, in which the HT cycle absorbs
heat from the exhaust gas and the LT cycle recovers waste heat di-
rectly from the engine block. A water/ethanol mixture is used as
the working fluid for both the HT and LT cycles. The simulation
results showed that D-RCs promise to deliver a 20% high power
output and a 50% reduction in the total heat exchanger footprint.
Chen et al. [205] proposed a confluent expansion D-RCs for WHR
from a diesel engine, which also achieved an 8% increase in net
power output and an 18% reduction in heat exchanger volume. In
addition, Rosset et al. [207] conducted a multiple-objective com-

In marine applications, Sung and Kim [201] designed a D-RC to
utilize exhaust gas and engine coolant as heat sources, and LNG as
a cold source, producing up to a 5.17% additional power output for
the original LNG carrier’s engine. Soffiato et al. [34] applied a dual-
pressure concept RC to utilize low-temperature waste heat (engine
coolant, lubricating oil, and intake air) and indicated that D-RCs
could deliver double the power output of R-RCs. Accordingly, the
power output of the LNG carrier increased by approximately 2.48%.
A similar study conducted by Rech et al. [208] reported that tran-
scritical D-RCs exhibit better system performance than B-RCs and
subcritical D-RCs.

Even with the improvements afforded by the regenerative pro-
cess, a large amount of low-temperature waste heat possessed by
the engine coolant remains unused. Multiloop Rankine cycles, in-
cluding C-RCs and D-RCs, were proposed in response to this issue.
Thermodynamic perfection analyses on existing studies in the open
literature  showed  that  multiloop  Rankine  cycles  are  expected  to
achieve a satisfactory thermodynamic perfection (43.5% to 62.3%).
Meanwhile, multiloop Rankine cycle design is supposed to follow
the principle of “energy utilization according to quality,” meaning
that CxHyOz and siloxanes or CO
2 is adopted to utilize the high-
grade waste heat in the HT cycle, while traditional refrigerants are
recommended for the low-grade waste heat in the LT cycle.

5. Key components

Having determined the cycle configuration and working fluid,
the selection and design of key components (heat exchanger, ex-
pander, pump, etc.) play a critical role in the application of RCs for
ICE-WHR. Recent progress on the key components in RCs is dis-
cussed in this section. In the H-iCycle, heat could be transferred
without a temperature difference in the heat exchangers, and tur-
bomachinery could also operate with no irreversible loss. Thus, de-
creasing the heat transfer temperature difference in the heat ex-
changers,  as  well  as  increasing  the  efficiency  of  turbomachinery
could substantially improve actual RCs toward the H-iCycle.

5.1. Heat exchanger

The necessary temperature difference allows the heat exchanger
to transfer heat in a reasonable time and heat transfer area, but
also leads to the imperfection of RCs. In theory, an optimized heat
exchanger is expected to minimize the heat transfer loss, thus im-
proving the thermal matching in both the hot and cold sides.

Heat  exchangers  associated  with  RCs  in  ICE-WHR  are  catego-
rized into evaporators, in which heat is transferred from the ex-
haust  gas  to  the  working  fluid;  preheaters,  in  which  heat  from
the engine coolant is transferred to the cycle working fluid; con-
densers, in which the working fluid rejects heat to the heat sink;
and regenerators, in which the unutilized heat of the working fluid
after the expander is supplied to preheat the working fluid before
the evaporator. In these heat exchangers, heat is transferred from
the  hot  side  to  the  cold  side  in  the  separated  channel  without
mixing.  There  is  evidence  that  heat  transfer  exchangers  strongly
contribute  to  the  footprint  and  capital  cost  of  the  whole  sys-
tem. According to our previous estimation [ 59 , 200 ], heat exchang-
ers account for 33–37% of the total cost, and occupy more than

observed that multiloop RCs, using CxHyOz and siloxanes or CO
2
for the HT cycle and traditional refrigerants for the LT cycle, have
a higher thermodynamic perfection, in comparison with those us-
ing traditional refrigerants for both the HT cycle and the LT cycle.
Such a combination conforms to the principle of “energy utilization
according to quality” because C x H y O z and siloxanes are proved to
be more suitable in high-temperature heat sources, whereas tra-
ditional refrigerants are appropriate for low-temperature applica-
tions.  C-RCs  and  D-RCs  with  proper  working  fluid  pairs  are  ob-
served to achieve a satisfactory thermodynamic perfection (43.5%
to 62.3%).

4.4. Summary

The existing cycle configuration modifications based on B-RCs
can  be  grouped  into  three  categories:  regeneration-based  modi-
fications  (R-RCs),  cascade-based  modifications  (C-RCs),  and  dual-
pressure cycle-based modifications (D-RCs). The fundamentals and
necessity of these modifications were illustrated by means of t–
q diagrams. R-RCs have been proven to have a better thermody-
namic  performance  than  B-RCs,  owing  to  their  capability  of  im-
proving thermal matching in both the cold and heat source sides,
especially for dry working fluids and CO
2 . However, the negative
effects of adding regenerator, including additional capital cost and
an increasing pressure drop, may offset its original benefits in per-
formance gain.

half of the total volume. In addition, the type, geometry, and ar-
ranged form of the heat exchangers all have an influence on the
heat  transfer  area  [209] ,  pressure  drop  [210] ,  weight  [211] ,  flow
loss [212] , and effectiveness [213] , thus affecting the performance
of  the  Rankine  cycle  system.  Experimental  studies  such  as  that
conducted  by  Zheng  et  al.  [214]  have  shown  that  the  heat  ex-
changer area has considerable influence on the Rankine cycle sys-
tem performance, the maximum increase in thermal efficiency of
the Rankine cycle can be up to 7.91% with the heat exchanger area
varies. Sensitive analysis in Ref. [215] indicates that the largest dif-
ference in specific investment cost of the Rankine cycle reaches up
to 14.7% among various arranged forms of heat exchangers.

Two common types of heat exchangers adopted in RCs for ICE-
WHR are shell–tube heat exchangers [216–219] and plate-type heat
exchangers [ 220 , 221 ]. Generally, a shell–tube heat exchanger is ro-
bust  to  withstand  high  pressure  and  high  temperature,  with  its
simple  structure  and  ease  of  installation,  management and  safe-
guarding.  Thus,  shell–tube  heat  exchangers  are  typically  suitable
for large-scale high-pressure applications, such as marine and sta-
tionary ICE applications. However, the main disadvantage of shell–
tube heat exchangers is their large weight and volume, and low
heat transfer coefficient. Plate heat exchangers promise to be more
compact  and  lightweight.  Mavridou  et  al.  [222]  reported  that  a
standard plate heat exchanger  has 66.5% less volume and a sig-
nificantly lower pressure drop compared to shell–tube exchangers
with finned tubes. Plate heat exchangers consist of a combination
of many thin and light plates by brazing and gaskets, which are
suitable for cases of low-to-medium flow rates, temperature, and
pressure. Plate deformation, brazing failure, and gasket damage are
the main obstacles for plate heat exchangers in high-temperature
and high-pressure applications. Adding fins to these two kinds of
heat exchangers is a common heat transfer enhancement method.
Fins on the surface of tubes [223] or plates [220] can extend the
heat transfer area, as well as increase the heat transfer rate and
heat transfer coefficient. Jiménez-Arreola et al. [224] compared di-
rect evaporation (finned tube heat exchanger) and indirect evap-
oration (shell and tube heat exchanger and plate heat exchanger
in cascade) in RCs coupled with a 240 kW diesel engine. The au-
thors claimed that direct evaporation (finned tube heat exchanger)
has 88% less weight and 70% less volume than indirect evapora-
tion.  The  comparison  results  in  Ref.  [222]  indicated  that  finned
tubes  enable  shell  tube  heat  exchangers  to  reduce  their  weight
by 51%. Metal-foam is another heat transfer enhancement method,
in  the  form  of  fins  [225]  or  coupled  surfaces  [226] .  Chen  et  al.
[158] estimated that shell–tube heat exchangers modified by metal
foam could achieve a 66.6% reduction in weight and volume with
a  similar  pressure  drop.  Printed-circuit  heat  exchangers  are  also
under investigation as feasible substitutes for plate heat exchang-
ers. Printed-circuit heat exchangers are expected to be 85% smaller
and lighter than traditional shell–tube heat exchangers [227] , and
robust to operate at high temperature (800 °C) and high pressure
(100  MPa).  The  application  of  such  heat  transfer  enhancement
methods faces common challenges: increased cost, increased pres-
sure drop, difficulty to clean the pathway, and clogging risk. Thus,
a reasonable heat exchanger design is usually made as a trade-off
among system performance, cost, size, weight, and other applica-
tion concerns.

5.1.1. Evaporator (exhaust gas heat exchanger)

An evaporator refers to a heat exchanger transferring heat from
the  exhaust  gas  to  the  working  fluid,  which  exists  in  almost  all
RCs in ICE-WHR. The evaporator is supposed to tolerate high pres-
sure, high temperature, and corrosion. The operating pressure of
the evaporator is strongly dependent on the working fluid, even
2 -based RCs. Because of the sulfur content
reaching 10 MPa for CO
in exhaust gas, especially for marine diesel with high sulfur con-

tent,  exhaust  gas  should  be  kept  above  its  acid  dew  point  (90–
120 °C) to prevent corrosion of the heat exchanger. Another issue
to consider is the clogging risk caused by the soot deposit. Partially
burned HC and soot particles may be deposited on the surface of
the heat exchanger, leading to heat transfer performance degrada-
tion, or even soot fires. This usually occurs on the fin or in the
microchannel. Thus, the cleaning and maintenance of the evapo-
rator should be considered in the design process. As the trade-off
between heat transfer performance and heat transfer area, pinch
point temperature differences in the range of 10–30 K [ 59 , 122 ] are
commonly chosen in the design phase.

To meet these requirements, shell–tube heat exchangers are pri-
marily employed for evaporators in ICE-WHR applications. Bari and
Hossain examined the exhaust gas heat recovery capability of two
shell–tube heat exchangers in parallel and series arrangements by
experiment, concluding that the parallel arrangement behaves bet-
ter than the series arrangement [228] . However, these shell–tube
heat exchangers are not customized for this experimental bench,
and the effectiveness of the heat exchanger is observed to be only
52%. A further structural optimization in Ref. [229] was performed
to achieve an effectiveness of 74%. As for heat transfer enhance-
ment [15] , BMW [223] introduced horizon fins connecting tubes
to improve the heat transfer performance. Zhang’s group [ 230 , 231 ]
proposed  a  finned-tube  heat  exchanger  for  waste  heat  recovery
from a diesel engine, in which a round fin is added on the smooth
tubes in the exhaust gas side (as shown in Fig. 28 (a)). The authors
indicated that the proposed finned-tube heat exchanger could cool
exhaust gas from 550 to 115 °C [232] with an acceptable pressure
drop (1 kPa) [233] . Furthermore, the authors conducted a multi-
objective optimization using the particle swarm optimization algo-
rithm aimed at the proposed heat exchanger and reported that the
optimal design scheme has the potential to achieve a 71.46% de-
crease in the total annual cost and a 27.6% reduction in the exhaust
gas pressure drop [218] . Hatami et al. compared the heat trans-
fer performance and pressure drop between the longitudinal and
circular finned-tube, which indicated that longitudinal fins on the
tube are more suitable [234] (shown in Fig. 28 (b)). Based on that
result, an optimization model using computational fluid dynamics
(CFD) methods was proposed to analyze the effect of fin number,
fin  length,  and  various  nanofluids.  The  results  indicated  that  in-
creasing  the  fin  number  is  beneficial  to  performance  [235] .  The
experimental results in Ref. [236] also confirmed the above con-
clusion that an optimized finned-tube heat exchanger yields a de-
sirable energy recovery and engine performance. Mastrullo et al.
[237] introduced a shell and louvered fin minitube heat exchanger
(see Fig. 28 (c)) to exploit the exhaust gas waste heat from an HDDE
for truck applications and a gasoline light-duty engine for passen-
ger applications. The heat transfer efficiency could reach at least
80% for the diesel engine and 75% for the gasoline engine. Zhang
et al. [238] used a hybrid enhancement concept to modify a shell–
tube heat exchanger with twisted inserts. In this heat exchanger,
H-type fins are arranged in the high-temperature zone and wave-
like fins are arranged in the low-temperature zone (as shown in
Fig. 28 (d)). It was reported that the modified heat exchanger pro-
duced a 12.5% increase in heat transfer effectiveness and a 53% in-
crease in the number of heat transfer units (NTU).

Plate heat exchangers have also been considered and evaluated
by several scholars as evaporators, owing to their small size, light
weight,  and  desirable  heat  transfer  performance  [ 220 , 221 , 239 ].
Feru  et  al.  [220]  presented  a  modeling  method  for  a  two-phase
plate fin heat exchanger to utilize the waste heat from an HDDE.
This model showed a good accuracy with low computational com-
plexity. However, as mentioned above, a traditional plate heat ex-
changer is unreliable to operate under high temperature (250 °C)
and high pressure. Thus plate heat exchangers hold less potential
to serve as evaporators.

5.1.2. Regenerator

Apart  from  evaporators,  regenerators  often  exist  in  R-RCs  to
transfer heat from the working fluid at the expander exit to the
working  fluid  before  the  evaporator.  Depending  on  the  selected
working fluid, the pressure difference between the hot and cold
side in regenerators is high, which is the key consideration when
designing or selecting the regenerator. At the design phase, a pinch
point temperature difference in the range of 10–15 K is suggested
from prior studies. Mondejar et al. [35] recommended shell–tube
heat exchangers as the regenerator for marine applications. How-
ever,  plate  heat  exchangers  [ 67 , 84 , 85 , 176 ]  are  more  widely  em-
ployed in existing test benches or prototypes for vehicular WHR-
RCs, in consideration of their compactness and practicality.

5.1.3. Condenser

As  for  condensers,  the  cooling  method  (air  or  water  cooling)
and cooling medium (engine coolant, ambient air, or seawater in
marine applications) have a great influence on the configuration of
the condenser. As pointed out by Zhao et al. [240] , the water cool-
ing method (a secondary water cooling loop is added to transfer
heat from the condenser to ambient air) is more suitable than the
air cooling method (direct cooling by ambient air) for onboard RCs.
Using engine coolant as the heat sink is beneficial for the integra-
tion and compactness of the whole system [18] . However, in com-
parison with the case of using ambient air as the heat sink, an 11–
15% performance loss can be observed [98] . Condensation of RCs
in large-scale marine or stationary applications is less challenging,
because sea water or underground water can be a desirable cool-
ing medium. If applying a direct cooling method by seawater or
underground water, a special measure is required to minimize the
corrosion risk and eliminate biofouling [35] . In the design phase,
the condensing pressure is supposed to be higher than the am-
bient pressure to prevent air leaking into the system. Meanwhile,
a small pinch point temperature difference of 5 K or a heat sink
temperature increase of 5 K is set for most cases. Both shell–tube
heat exchangers [ 67 , 77 ] and plate heat exchangers [ 85 , 114 , 241 , 242 ]
are applicable, but the plate heat exchanger seems to be a more
promising solution, because it allows a lower approach tempera-
ture difference.

5.1.4. Summary

As  summarized  above,  there  is  evidence  that  the  shell–tube
heat exchanger would be more applicable as the evaporator, be-
cause it could operate reliably at high temperature and pressure. A

plate-type heat exchanger is recommended for a regenerator and
condenser, owing to its compactness and high heat transfer perfor-
mance. However, it is difficult for basic heat exchangers to satisfy
the requirements for practical feasibility in terms  of  weight and
space; a further heat transfer enhancement method is required to
achieve high efficiency, miniaturization, and light weight of heat
exchangers. Heat transfer enhancement by fins is a relatively ma-
ture technology that has been widely used in many fields. More-
over, metal foam heat exchangers and microchannel heat exchang-
ers are likely to be two promising directions for future research.
Metal foam has attracted the attention of many scholars because
of  its  large  exchange  surface  area,  low  density,  high  permeabil-
ity, and good thermal conductivity. Microchannel heat exchangers
could adopt the vacuum diffusion welding process instead of the
traditional brazing process, so it is viable at high temperature and
high pressure conditions. However, the major obstacle to the ap-
plication of these two heat exchangers in ICE-WHR is the clogging
issue caused by particle deposit in the exhaust gas. The flow path
in these two types of heat exchangers is small and easily blocked
by particles in exhaust gas, resulting in performance degradation,
or even failure of the heat exchanger.

5.2. Expander

An expander is the core component of an RC,  which directly
outputs power and has a significant influence on the system per-
formance.  Extensive  research  has  shown  that  the  expander  effi-
ciency profile would determine the system thermal efficiency pro-
file  [ 95 , 243 ].  For  a  radial  turbine  used  in  R245fa  based  small
scale ORC, when the average turbine efficiency increase from 76.0%
to  82.2%,  the  average  cycle  efficiency  could  increase  from  5.05%
to  5.66%,  correspondingly  [244] .  From  the  thermal  matching  as-
pect, higher expander efficiency results in a lower temperature at
the expander outlet, contributing to improving cold side thermal
matching. Generally, expanders used in RCs could be categorized
into two  groups: velocity  type  (axial turbine and  radial turbine)
and volume type (scroll expander, screw expander, reciprocal pis-
ton expander, and sliding vane expander).

The  choice  of  expander  type  strongly  depends  on  the  power
output  level  and  pressure  ratio.  Moreover,  several  operating  and
practical  concerns  should  also  be  considered,  including  work-
ing  fluid  type,  rotational  speed,  component  size,  isentropic  effi-
ciency,  complexity,  lubrication,  cost,  safety,  integration,  and  reli-
ability  [ 245 , 246 ].  Turbines  are  reported  to  be  widely  applied  in

broad  power  and  expansion  ratio  ranges,  whereas  volume  ex-
panders seem to be more suitable for low-capacity systems with
small expansion ratio [247–249] . Quoilin [247] presented the al-
lowable operating map of a scroll expander, screw expander, and
radial turbine with various working fluids in subcritical ORCs. In
consideration of limitations of under-expansion losses and volume
coefficient  for  volume-type  expanders,  as  well  as  limitations  of
maximum specific speed and maximum Mach number for turbines,
the author concluded that radial turbines are adapted to a large
power range and are applicable for various temperature power sys-
tems. Furthermore, turbines have advantages in their simple struc-
ture, high efficiency, desirable off-design performance [250] , and
no contact seal issue. However, the application of turbines faces
two major challenges. First, turbines commonly operate at high ro-
tational speeds (up to 50,0 0 0–60,0 0 0 rpm), and thus a high-speed
generator or large transmission ratio gear shifter is required to out-
put electric or mechanical power. These two aspects still remain an
issue  and are under  development. Second,  turbines  are sensitive
to liquid droplets during expansion owing to blade corrosion; an
accurate control system or additional bypass structure is needed
to ensure safe operation, which may increase system complexity.
From Andreas’s view [251] , turbines can compete with any volume
expander as long as high rotational speed is acceptable, and effi-
ciency is not the only consideration.

According to the flow direction of the working fluid, turbines
can be divided into axial and radial types. For radial turbines, the
flow direction of the working fluid is radial to the shaft, whereas
the flow direction of the working fluid is parallel to the shaft for
the axial type. Radial turbines are capable of handling an expan-
sion  ratio  of  up  to  9  in  one  stage,  whereas  a  three-stage  struc-
ture  is  required  at  such  an  expansion  ratio  with  the  axial  type
[252] . This means that a single-stage radial turbine can deliver the
same  specific  power  as  two  or  more  stage  axial  turbines  [253] .
Therefore, axial turbines perform better in large-capacity applica-
tions with high flow rates, low enthalpy drops, and low pressure
ratios,  whereas  radial  turbines  are  more  suitable  for  cases  with
small flow rates, high enthalpy drops, and high pressure ratio. In
comparison with axial turbines, radial turbines are less sensitive to
the blade machining precision, more robust and have a longer ser-
vice life and lower maintenance cost. This makes them dominate
the single-shaft turbine engines below 1 MW, which are suitable
for automobile applications and medium-scale marine applications
[254] . Axial turbines are expected to achieve higher efficiency in
a high power range, which is the better choice for large-scale sta-
tionary or marine applications, especially when multi-stage turbine
configuration is needed.

As  for  volume  expanders,  several  scholars  attempt  to  apply
them for WHR-RCs in automobile applications, owing to their low
power  capacities.  Volume  expanders  have  relatively  lower  rota-
tional  speed,  and  thus  they  could  connect  to  the  generator  di-
rectly without a speed reduction gearbox, or easily couple to the
engine crankshaft. However, the common challenges faced by vol-
ume  expanders  include  sealing  issues,  lubrication  requirements,
and  friction  losses.  Among  them,  a  piston  expander  has  a  rela-
tively high expansion ratio (in a range of 6–14) [255] , and could
withstand high pressure and high temperature (70 bar and 560 °C).
The isentropic efficiencies of piston expanders reported in the ex-
isting  open  literature  are  in  a  wide  range  of  28–76%  [256] .  One
of the drawbacks of piston expanders is that they have a compli-
cated structure and require precise timing of charge and discharge
valves, which increases system cost and complexity. Liquid droplet
corrosion risk, severe friction losses, and lubrication requirements
are  also  technical  barriers  in  the  application  of  piston  turbines.
A vane expander has a simple structure, low cost, and moderate
machining requirement, which is applicable for low-capacity ( < 10
kW) and small-expansion-ratio ( < 5) power systems [251] . How-

ever, a vane expander has a relatively low isentropic efficiency ( <
50%)  due  to  high  friction  loss  and  leakage  loss  [257] .  Compared
with the above volume expanders, scroll expanders and screw ex-
panders  are  relatively  mature  technology  and  are  more  promis-
ing in WHR-RCs. They both have a simple structure, relatively low
friction and leakage losses and tolerance for two-phase expansion
[248] . A scroll expander has a fixed built-in volume ratio ranging
from 1.5 to 4.0, and higher isentropic efficiency (up to 70%, even
for a 1 kW power system [258] ). A screw expander has a moder-
ate built-in volume ratio (5–8), a large power range (up to 1 MW),
and high efficiency (up to 92% [259] ). However, a screw expander
requires more precise machining than a scroll expander. From the
application point of view, all volume expanders are available for
small-scale vehicular applications, whereas only screw expanders
are expected to be employed in high-capacity marine applications.
Table 7 lists the comparative results of various expander types suit-
able for RCs in ICE-WHR.

5.2.1. Turbines

Recently, a considerable body of research has developed around
the theme of applications of radial turbines as expansion devices
in RCs for ICE-WHR. The mean-line model [254] and CFD model
[ 260 , 261 ]  are  common  tools  for  turbomachinery.  The  mean-line
model is a very efficient tool that can provide a preliminary de-
sign  decision,  including  stage  number,  diffuser  type,  rotor  size,
sharp, and flow state. These data would be used in a detailed de-
sign tool to determine the full 3D geometry, including meridional
contours and blade profile. After determining preliminary parame-
ters and 3D geometry, CFD analysis is applied to verify and adjust
the parameters to define the optimal design. Although there are
some mature tools, turbine design is still a challenging task, espe-
cially for low-capacity systems. Small power requirements lead to
reduced efficiency and increased rotational speed. Thus, a trade-
off among these design objectives is often necessary in practice.
Costall et al. [254] presented three various-scale radial turbine de-
sign schemes using the mean-line tool aimed at automobile ap-
plications. Among these, maximum isentropic efficiency of 56.1%
was reported with turbine power of a 45.6 kW. The author pointed
out that high density and density ratio, which result in small in-
let blade height and large blade height variation, are a major issue
for small-scale radial turbine design. A further optimization based
on the CFD tool benefits turbine efficiency improvement. An effi-
ciency increase of 13.7 was reported in Ref. [261] after the geomet-
ric rotor optimization using the CFD method. The integrated design
model combining the thermodynamic cycle and turbine modules
may help the designer to find a comprehensive design scheme of
the whole system. Such a method was introduced by Bahamonde
et al. [262] . The turbine module in the proposed integrated design
model was validated by experimental data [263] . Employing silox-
ane MM as working fluid, the radial turbine could generate 11.6
kW shaft power with total-to-static efficiency of 77.3%. To simplify
the structure for practical convenience, Guillaume et al. [84] first
proposed  an  oil-free  radial  turbine  prototype  to  recover  exhaust
gas waste heat from truck diesel engines. The innovation of this
prototype is that the bearing system and the generator are lubri-
cated and cooled down by the working fluid instead of lubricant
or coolant. However, experimental results showed that the overall
efficiency of this prototype is only approximately 28% owing to the
friction loss in the bearing system and heat loss to fluid lubricating
the bearing. Thus, further improvement and detailed assessments
for this scheme are still required before the practical application.

A high pressure ratio is beneficial to cycle efficiency of RCs, but
also introduces the issues of choking and supersonic flow for radial
turbine design, especially when using a working fluid with high
molecular complexity, which has a low sound speed. Ying et al.
[264]  presented  a  design  optimization  of  a  small-capacity,  high-

pressure-ratio, and supersonic radial turbine for automobile appli-
cations. The effect of geometric parameters of the stator and rotor
on turbine efficiency was investigated. The author concluded that
shock wave loss and trailing loss are major losses in the nozzles,
whereas loss caused by flow separation in the stator is dominant.
Improvement by the reduction in the pressure loss coefficient in
the  nozzle  leads  to  a  3.4%  increase  in  turbine  efficiency  (nearly
76%). Uusitalo et al. [265] designed and manufactured a supersonic
radial turbine ( Fig. 29 a) for WHR-RCs, powered by exhaust gas of
a diesel engine. This supersonic radial turbine has a high pressure
ratio of 112.9 using siloxane MDM as a working fluid. The prelimi-
nary test results indicated that this supersonic radial turbine could
produce 5.1 kW electric power, which is obviously lower than the
nominal value (10 kW). The author attributes this to the presence
of non-condensation air in the condensation process.

Apart  from  radial  turbines,  axial  turbines  have  also  gained
popularity in automobile applications [ 12 , 20 , 241 ]. Cipollone et al.
[241] investigated the performance of a single-stage impulse ax-
ial turbine mounted on an R245fa-based RC test bench fed by the

exhaust gas from a 35 kW diesel engine. The results showed that
the axial turbine delivered 2 kW of electric power and achieved an
overall efficiency of 45–48% at the rated turbine rotational speed
of 60,0 0 0 rpm. As mentioned above, axial turbines are intended to
be applied in high-capacity power systems. Thus, the partial ad-
mission method is often used in prior studies [ 12 , 266 ] to meet the
low-capacity requirement, which also contributes to increasing the
operating range, as well as improving the off-design performance
of the turbine when heat source parameters vary [267] . Kunte and
Seume [266] used a variable partial admission concept, by open-
ing or closing stator passages, to maintain the performance at par-
tial load and overload operating points. In this paper, the turbine
operates with two stator passages at the design point. When the
flow rate of the turbine is lower than the design value, only one
stator passage is open. Conversely, four stator passages are open
at the overload operating point. Their conclusion confirmed that
the partial admission axial turbine has a  flat performance curve
with turbine efficiency in the range of 44% to 65%. Recently, Shu’s
group  developed  a  kilowatt-scale  partial  admission  axial  turbine

(see Fig. 29 b) for a CO
2 -based RC in ICE-WHR [268] . The prelimi-
nary experimental results indicated that the maximum power out-
put and isentropic efficiency of this turbine are 692 W and 53.43%,
respectively. Leakage issues caused by a dynamic seal failure may
be responsible for the power loss.

5.2.2. Volume expanders

This section reviews the details about volume expanders in RCs

for ICE-WHR.

Scroll expanders are suggested to be applied in WHR-RC sys-
tems for small-capacity ICEs. Lu et al. [ 178 , 269 ] presented a pa-
rameter optimization of the scroll expander in an R245fa-based RC
system, which is powered by a 6.5 kW gasoline engine. They re-
ported that  the  proposed scroll expander could  deliver 1  kW  of
power with the rotational speed of 40 0 0 rpm, at the engine rated
load. In order to realize the compact design of the scroll expander,
an algebraic spiral curve for the scroll wrap profile was presented
by Kim et al. [270] to achieve a 13.2% reduction in the scroll diam-
eter with respect to the conventional involute one ( Fig. 29 (c)). Af-
ter that, an algebraic spiral scroll expander was designed and man-
ufactured for an engine coolant-powered WHR-RC. The test results
revealed that this scroll expander could deliver up to 710 W with
a total expander efficiency of 45%.

Screw  expanders  have  been  proven  to  be  an  affordable  solu-
tion  in  both  large-capacity  marine  applications  [271]  and  small-
capacity  vehicular  applications  [ 272 , 273 ].  OPCON  [271]  first  in-
stalled  a  screw  expander  based-WHR-RC  system  on  a Wallenius’
ship,  targeting  a  4–6%  fuel  savings.  They  claimed  that  such  sys-
tem may offer the possibility to achieve fuel savings of 5-10%. Wu’s
group [ 272 , 274 , 275 ] developed a single screw expander prototype
( Fig. 29 d) for a small-scale WHR system. A preliminary function
experiment was carried out to verify the performance of this pro-
totype, indicating a relatively low total efficiency of 32.5%, owing
to  poor  lubrication.  In  later  studies,  optimizations  of  the  intake
pressure, rotational, speed, and gaps, as well as improvements in
lubrication, enabled this screw expander to reach a higher total ef-
ficiency. Applying such an expander into a vehicle diesel engine–
ORC combined system, the author estimated that 28.6 kW addi-
tional power could be obtained at the rated condition of the stud-
ied diesel engine (280 kW) [275] . These results were validated and
confirmed  by  the  following  lab  test.  Although  the  power  output
obtained in the test bench is relatively low (10.38 kW), the max-
ima of volume efficiency, adiabatic efficiency, and total efficiency of
the single-screw expander could reach 90.73%, 73.25%, and 57.88%,
respectively. [272] .

Piston turbines are also applicable for small-to-medium RCs in
ICE-WHR,  which  have  been  highlighted  in  WHR-RC  system  de-
velopment for the long-haul truck by Ricardo plc [24] and HEHR
[18] . Zhang’s group [ 276 , 277 ] developed a single-piston free piston
expander  coupled  with  a  linear  generator  ( Fig.  29 (e))  to  recover
waste heat from a vehicular engine, demonstrating that the pis-
ton expander could operate stably and its power output is asso-
ciated with piston velocity. When the maximum piston velocity is
0.69 m/s, the piston expander delivers the maximum power out-
put of 96 W. A maximum energy conversion efficiency of 45.82%
is  also  reported  from  the  experiment.  Another  study  conducted
by Zhang’s group [278] focused on the effect of valve timing on
motion characteristics and power output performance. The maxi-
mum power output could reach 18.6 W, with a peak indicated ef-
ficiency of 66.2%. Moreover, simulation analysis and optimization
of a piston expander are also conducted using a GT-power model
[279] and a 3D CFD model [280] for automotive waste heat recov-
ery.

Another type of piston expander used for RCs in automobile ap-
plications  is  known  as  a  swash-plate  expander.  Aiming  at  a  2.0
L vehicular gasoline engine, Honda [219] constructed a steam RC

prototype, in which a swash-plate expander is employed to output
power. The preliminary test results indicated that the thermal effi-
ciency of the vehicle is expected to increase by 13.2% at a constant
speed of 100 km/h. Later, Dolz’s [114] group conducted an exper-
imental  study  of  a  swash-plate  expander  installed on  a  153  kW
gasoline engine. Because of leakages, friction losses, inlet or outlet
pressure drop and heat losses, the maximum isentropic efficiency
of this swash-plate expander is only 38.5%, resulting in a 3.7% in-
crease in the mechanical efficiency of the studied engine. Subse-
quently,  the  authors  [281]  developed  a  global  simulation  model
combining an RC submodel and a swash-plate expander submodel,
which was validated by the above experimental data. This model
allows a multiobjective optimization of the integrated system (ICE-
RCs–swash-plate expander) [282] .

Vane expanders are also regarded as a promising technology in
automobile applications, owing to their simplicity, low cost, com-
pact  size,  and  light  weight.  In  1978,  General  Electric  [283]  de-
veloped  a  multivane  expander  prototype  and  installed  it  on  a
WHR-RC system for waste heat recovery from a Mack Truck 676
diesel engine, indicating a 10–14% improvement in fuel economy
when the diesel engine operates at a high power level. In 2008,
BMW  [14]  launched  the  “turbosteamer” project  to  apply  the  C-
RCs system to utilize both high-temperature exhaust gas and low-
temperature engine coolant from the passenger cars. A vane ex-
pander  was  adopted  for  both  high-temperature  cycle  and  low-
temperature cycle. The test results demonstrated that power pro-
duced by two vane expanders is in the range of 0.7–2.0 kW, corre-
sponding to a 10% increase in power output for the studied diesel
engine [284] . To maximize power output, Fatigati et al. [285] pro-
vided  a  novel  operating  strategy,  which  attempted  to  raise  cell
pressure by an auxiliary suction phase at the conventional closed
volume  expansion.  This  strategy  was  validated  by  test  data  of  a
vane expander prototype ( Fig. 29 (f)) on an automotive RC system,
in which 0.7 ∼1.9 kW mechanical power could be produced with a
maximum total efficiency of 53.3%.

5.2.3. Summary

Table 8 summarizes the test results of various prototypes for
ICE-WHR. The operational map of various expander types is char-
acterized by their power output range. Expander design and man-
ufacture are less challenging in the high-power output range. Tur-
bines and screw expanders could be the most suitable candidates
for  large-scale  marine  and  stationary  applications.  Therefore,  re-
cent studies have mainly focused on R&D on small-scale expanders
to fit automobile applications. The data in Table 8 shows that the
turbine (radial or axial) has been the most popular choice with the
power  output  range of  2–30 kW.  Among  volume  expanders,  the
screw expander could operate with a moderate power range of 2–
10 kW, and the remaining types of volume expanders produce less
than 2.5 kW, which is lower than the WHR power requirement of
the majority of automobile applications. Thus, turbines seem to be
the most promising candidates for automobile applications, owing
to their high efficiency and large power output range.

The application of turbines as expansion devices in automobile
applications still faces several challenges. The above analysis en-
tails  the  following  remarks:  (1)  small  power  requirement  of  the
WHR system for automobile application may result in an unreason-
ably small blade height and low efficiency of the turbine. The par-
tial admission method [ 266 , 268 ] has been adopted to alleviate this
issue. (2) WHR-RC system always operates under off-design con-
ditions owing to the variation of engine operating conditions, re-
sulting in the performance degradation of the turbine. The partial
admission method has been proved effective to improve off-design
performance, and the variable inlet guide vane is another possi-
ble measure [286] . (3) Turbines generally operate at high rotational
speeds (10,0 0 0–10 0,0 0 0 rpm), especially for the small capacity tur-

bines. It is imperative to explore high transmission gearboxes and
high-speed generators to meet the requirements of automobile ap-
plications. (4) The low efficiency of turbines in existing publica-
tions is mainly attributed to the friction loss in bearings and leak-
age loss. Advances in bearings (such as magnetic bearings [287] )
and sealing technology (such as dry gas seals [288] ) may make the
turbine practical and affordable for automobile applications.

5.3. Pump

A  pump  is  used  to  pressurize  the  working  fluid  from  low  to
high pressure, which has a strong influence on the overall cycle
performance.  The  power  consumed  by  the  pump  would  offset  a
part of power output from the expander. The operation character-
istics of working fluid pump is the dominant factor of the pump
work  consumption  and  the  working  fluid  mass  flow  rate,  which
severely affect the net power output of Rankine cycle [289] . Using
the back-work ratio (BWR: the ratio of pump power consumption
to expander power output) as an indicator, previous studies sug-
gested that specific pump work decreases for working fluids with
high critical temperature (especially if greater than 150 °C) [290] ,
the BWR for Rankine cycles with relatively low working fluid crit-
ical  temperature  could  reach  10–30%  [ 193 , 291 ],  even  up  to  98%
in experimental studies [292] . Therefore, the power input of the
working fluid pump could not be negligible, especially for Organic
Rankine  cycles.  In  addition,  by  changing  the  working  fluid  flow
rate, the pump also plays an important role in the control of the
high pressure in the RC system [293] .

From the connection aspect, the working fluid pump could be
coupled to the engine crankshaft [294] , coupled to the expander
[ 265 , 295 ],  or  directly  driven  by  an  electric  motor  [ 84 , 268 ].  The
first arrangement does not need an additional electric motor, and
thus saves cost. However, the operational flexibility of the pump
is limited by the engine crankshaft, an auxiliary control and ad-
justment system is required to accurately control the mass flow.
Thus, this arrangement may be more suitable for large-scale inte-
grated energy systems for marine or stationary applications. The
second arrangement promises to be more compact by the turbine–
generator–pump integrated design scheme, in which the turbine,
generator, and the pump are connected to the same shaft. When
the turbine produces more power output than the pump consump-
tion power, the remaining power is used to make electricity in the
generator. Hence, such an arrangement is recommended for auto-
mobile applications, due to their space and weight constraints.

The  pump  used  in  the  RC  system  could  be  categorized  into
two groups: volumetric pump (diaphragm, rotary-vane, or plunger

pump)  and  centrifugal  pump.  Volumetric  pumps  have  relatively
low  efficiencies  in  the  range  of  15–40%  [ 291 , 296 , 297 ].  Volumet-
ric pumps are called constant flow machines, meaning that they
could theoretically deliver the same flow rate at a constant rota-
tional speed without being affected by the inlet or outlet pressure.
This characteristic provides convenience for control. The drawback
of  volumetric  pumps  is  that  their  maximum  flow  rate  is  lim-
ited by pump size, and thus they are recommended for small or
medium-capacity  systems  ( < 50  kW  [35] ).  Unlike  the  volumetric
pumps,  centrifugal  pumps  could  produce  a  continuous  flow  rate
with high efficiency ( > 60% [298] ) and a broad power range. Cen-
trifugal  pumps  are  unchallenged  in  high-capacity  systems.  Their
flow rate not only depends on the rotational speed, but also on
the inlet and outlet pressure, which make the control system more
complex owing to the interactions among components.

Performance improvement of the working fluid pump is signif-
icant for the optimization of the whole RC system. Several studies
focused on this topic. Bianchi et al. [299] adopted a sliding vane
pump in a small-scale WHR-RC system and demonstrated that this
pump has a maximum overall efficiency of 36.9%. To explore the
possible  solution  for  pump  performance  improvement,  they  de-
veloped a one-dimensional CFD model of the sliding vane pump,
which is validated by experimental data. Simulation results by a
geometric optimization on the stator diameter and axial length re-
vealed that an 11% overall efficiency increase could be obtained.
Moreover,  the  thermal  fluid  exchanger  pump  is  also  developed
[ 193 , 300 ], which is powered by heat instead of mechanical power
or electricity. No additional power is needed for this pump, and
thus the BWR of the thermal fluid exchanger pump would be zero.
Shu et al. [193] employed a thermofluidic feed pump in the low-
temperature loop of a C-RC, which was used to recover waste heat
from diesel engines. Compared with a traditional system using a
mechanical pump, the proposed system achieved a 7.6% increase
in net power and 9.1% in thermal efficiency. However, the appli-
cation of such thermal fluid exchanger pump still faces problems,
such as high cost and delayed response caused by thermal inertia.

6. Application concerns

Despite the great prospects in ICE-WHR, RCs still need careful
evaluation in terms of practicality before application. Several neg-
ative effects and complications in practical operation and manage-
ment, such as weight increase, engine backpressure increase, and
efficient control under transient fluctuation, may offset their orig-
inal benefits in performance gain and fuel reduction. Thus, in this
section, some key limiting factors, including backpressure, weight,

27

Previous studies also attempted to alleviate the negative effect
of back pressure from two major aspects: the engine’s turbocharg-
ing modification and heat exchanger optimization. As pointed by
Battista  et  al.  [304] ,  when  the  engine’s  back  pressure  increases,
the  manipulation  of  the  inlet  guide  vane  (IGV)  opening  degree
could change the turbocharging speed and pressure, compensating
the negative effect of back pressure. N. Michos et al. [138] com-
pared  and  investigated  three  turbocharging  strategies  (fixed  tur-
bine, waste-gate, and variable geometry turbine) to alleviate the
back-pressure issue. Fixed turbine is the basic turbocharger config-
uration with a fixed geometry for both the compressor and tur-
bine,  and  thus  it  is  not  possible  to  control  the  boost  pressure.
Waste-gate attempts to control the boost pressure by applying a
waste-gate valve to bypass the turbine. Variable geometry turbine
could change the geometry of the effective turbine area to reach
the requested boost pressure. They concluded that the application
of variable geometry turbine could effectively alleviate the negative
impact of backpressure on the system performance.

Heat exchanger optimization is another significant aspect to re-
duce the pressure drop of exhaust gas [308] . Among the heat ex-
changer types, the shell–finned-tube heat exchanger is a more rea-
sonable choice than the plate heat exchanger in consideration of
backpressure. As reported in Ref. [304] , the use of a shell–finned-
tube heat exchanger could keep the BSFC increase below 1%, which
is  estimated  to  be  2–5%  if  the  plate  heat  exchanger  is  adopted.
Similar  results  are  also  found  in  the  studies  by  Bei  et  al.  [309] .
An  integration  simulation  model  coupling  a  3D  finned  and  tube
heat exchanger and a 1D diesel engine was developed to analyze
the influence of the heat exchanger on the original diesel engine.
An acceptable pressure drop (0.18–2.22 mbar) was reported, which
may  cause  a  BSFC  increase  of  less  than  1%.  Moreover,  the  opti-
mization of the fin geometry would effectively reduce the pressure
drop in heat exchangers. An experimental comparison by Hatami
et  al.  [236]  indicated  that  up  to  20.5%  reduction  in  the  pres-
sure drop is obtained for a finned-tube heat exchanger by struc-
tural optimization, which also translates into better overall system
performance.

6.2. Weight

Weight increase is another negative effect of the integration of
the RC with ICEs, especially for automobile applications. From the
aspect of the vehicle itself, prior studies have indicated that weight
increase would inevitably result in the increase in fuel consump-
tion [ 310 , 311 ] and NOx emissions [312] . As estimated by N. Clark
et  al.  [312] , a 32% increase in  weight for a  diesel bus  may  lead
to a 19% increase in fuel consumption and a 14% increase in NOx
emissions. Taking the driving conditions into consideration, a fuel
consumption reduction of up to 12% could be achieved by a 20%
weight reduction for a delivery truck [311] .

Combining a Rankine bottom cycle into the vehicle, Di Battista
et al. [304] assumed to install a 50 kg RC system on a 3350 kg
light-duty  vehicle  and  evaluated  the  energy  loss  caused  by  the
weight  increase.  As  shown  in  Fig.  30 ,  the  extra  weight  brought
by the RC generated a 0.7–1.25% additional propulsive power de-
mand, which is equivalent to 1% loss in fuel consumption. Horst
et al. [303] evaluated the fuel saving potential of a WHR-RC system
mounted on a BMW 5 Series vehicle. Fig. 31 shows that the pro-
posed WHR system holds the potential of 3.4% fuel saving, whereas
the  fuel  saving  potential  would  reduce  to  1.3%  once  the  nega-
tive interactions between the WHR system and vehicle were con-
sidered. The additional weight would be responsible for approxi-
mately 20% of the fuel saving reduction. Usman et al. [313] evalu-
ated the positive and negative effects of an RC system on a light-
duty vehicle and suggested that such an RC system is not recom-
mended for urban driving vehicles if negative effects (weight in-

generator) [304] . Reprinted with permission from Elsevier, 2015.

power output type, off-design performance dynamic response, and
control are discussed in detail.

6.1. Backpressure

Backpressure produced by the exhaust gas heat exchanger has a
significant effect on the performance of ICEs. Increasing back pres-
sure leads to pump work increase, resulting in a decrease in en-
gine power that must be compensated by a fuel penalty [ 76 , 301 ].
Furthermore, back pressure also influences the combustion perfor-
mance and emission formation, which may cause damage to en-
gine parts [302] . Horst et al. [303] reported that, in a BMW 5 Series
vehicle, the average additional exhaust gas back pressure induced
by the RC system is 5–20 mbar at a constant speed cruise condi-
tion, and up to 100 mbar under acceleration conditions. The power
loss and fuel penalty caused by back pressure may be different in
various cases. 1.0% engine power loss per 30 mbar back pressure is
a good rule of thumb for a rough estimation [304] . A recent exper-
imental test on an IVECO F1C diesel engine conducted by Battista
et al. [304] measured the back pressure and BSFC at medium load
with various speeds (as shown in Fig. 30 ). The test results shown
in  Fig.  30  indicated  that  the  increase  in  back  pressure  induced
by the exhaust gas heat exchanger could reach approximately 300
mbar, resulting in a 2–5% increase in fuel consumption. The au-
thors  also  demonstrated  that  there  is  a  significant  difference  in
the BSFC reductions by RCs between the estimation value by only
the  thermodynamic  method  (up  to  6.32%)  and  the  real  one  (up
to 2.78%). Thus, the back pressure effect is indispensable for as-
sessing the feasibility of the technology. El Chammas and Clodic
[305] proposed an ORC for waste heat recovery from a vehicular
gasoline engine and estimated that the backpressure introduced by
the exhaust gas heat exchanger could result in a horsepower loss
of 1.5 ∼2.5% at high loads and 0.2 ∼0.5% at low loads. Similar re-
sults are obtained in the analysis of waste heat recovery Rankine
cycle from stationary ICEs. Gewald et al. [306] set a maximum al-
lowable exhaust gas heat exchanger pressure loss of 20 mbar and
found that backpressure loss in exhaust gas heat exchanger is pro-
portional to the heat exchanger area. Fortunately, in their analysis,
the actual backpressure loss is far below the maximum allowable
value, thus the impact of backpressure on system performance is
acceptable. Chatzopoulou and N. Markides [307] presented an in-
tegrated ICE-ORC CHP whole-system optimization framework that
takes into account the interaction between the ICEs and the ORC.
The effect of backpressure in ICEs performance is fed back in-real
time during optimization iterations.

tio had similar efficiency to the fully electrified turbine at a large
range of engine operating conditions, eliminating the concern of
inefficiency of the mechanically coupled turbine. As for various ex-
panders, turbines, axial or radial type, have high rotational speeds
of  up  to  10,0 0 0  rpm,  and  thus  large  transmission  ratio  gearbox
or  high-speed generator  is  required.  In  large-scale marine  appli-
cations, the selection of power output type is less challenging and
strongly depends on the ship type and energy demand [35] , owing
to fewer space limitations. For vehicular applications, the mechan-
ical power output type is more suitable for long-haul diesel trucks,
which have a relatively steady waste heat source and more space
for the WHR system. The electrical power output type may be a
promising option for small passenger vehicles, as the waste heat
source of the vehicle engine fluctuates and a battery can be used
to store unstable electricity.

With a long-term goal of achieving a 50% brake thermal effi-
ciency of the diesel engine, Cummins [320] developed an RC pro-
totype using a turbine as the expansion device and installed it in a
fleet of Class 8 trucks. The power produced by the turbine is cou-
pled to the engine crankshaft by a gearbox. Test results over three
different  drive  cycles  showed  that  this  RC  system  enabled  Class
8 trucks to reduce their fuel consumption by 5.1–6.0%, 4.3–4.7%,
and 3.0–4.1% in highway drive cycle, regional haul drive cycle, and
inter-city drive cycle, respectively. Similarly, in the WHR-RC proto-
type by AVL [22] , the torque of a piston expander was mechanically
coupled to the engine crankshaft by a belt drive and an interme-
diate shaft. A 2.5–3.4% fuel consumption reduction was observed
from the vehicle testing for both Europe and US real-life cycles.

The electrical power output type is also employed and tested
by automobile manufacturers. Honda R&D [219] designed and in-
stalled an RC prototype in a hybrid vehicle. The expansion device is
a piston-type expander, which is directly connected to a generator
to utilize power from the WHR system in the form of electricity.
Driving testing results at a constant speed of 100 km/h indicated
that the thermal efficiency of the studied hybrid vehicle increased
from 28.9% to 32.7%.

Recently, FEV NA, Inc. [ 118 , 321 ] proposed a novel approach for
the integration of turbocompounding/ORC, electrification, and su-
percharging  technologies  (ITES)  by  a  planetary  gear  system,  in
which  a  secondary  compressor,  ORC  expander,  and  electric  mo-
tor/generator are connected to the ring gear, sun gear and carrier
gear, respectively. The planetary gear system is equipped with a
dog clutch and a band brake, allowing the realization of the electri-
cal integration of the ORC expander when the power output of the
ORC system is low and mechanical/power split integration when
the  power  output  of  the  ORC  system  is  high.  Simulation  results
showed that the ITES approach provided an average reduction of
4.6%  in  the  fuel  consumption  with  a  compact  structure.  Despite
this, further evaluation on the applicability of the ITES approach is
still needed to obtain a comprehensive performance of this tech-
nology in the functionality of torque assist, regenerative braking,
and engine start-stop.

6.4. Off-design performance

In practice, the RC system fueled by waste heat from ICEs would
operate far from its design condition, owing to changes in engine
load,  which  results  in  performance  degradation  or  even  system
failure [322] . Marine vessels, vehicles, and stationary ICEs have a
variable operational profile [ 59 , 323 , 324 ], which directly affects the
WHR system performance potential in terms of the available waste
heat amount [73] and cycle efficiency [53] . Our previous studies
indicated that for the RC system powered by waste heat from ICE,
the maximum net power output, thermal efficiency, as well as ex-
ergy efficiency all decrease linearly with the drop in engine load

crease, back-pressure, and part-load performance loss) are consid-
ered.

Studies have also focused on the design optimization in consid-
eration of the WHR-RC weight. The power-to-weight ratio is the
most common indicator in optimization process. Previous studies
showed that RC system with maximum power-to-weight ratio is
not always optimal in terms of fuel savings or power output [314] .
Regarding  working  fluids,  cyclopentane  and  pentane  exhibited  a
desirable trade-off between net power output, weight, and volume
[315] . Shu et al. [316] provided critical weights (additional power
demand by such weight equal to the net power output of WHR
system) for a gasoline engine (215 kg) and a diesel engine (998
kg). However, the weight evaluation model used in previous stud-
ies is based on measurement data from a specific manufacturer,
which may not be applicable to other cases. Thus, a general and
theoretical model is still required. Moreover, advanced alloy mate-
rials, such as Al alloys [317] and Ni alloys [318] also contribute to
the light weight of the whole system, but very little work has been
devoted to this area.

6.3. Power output type (electrical or mechanical)

How to utilize the power produced by the WHR system is a key
issue in the system integration, especially for small-scale automo-
bile applications. In general, there are two common power output
types: mechanical power and electrical power. The former could
be realized by a gearbox connecting the engine crankshaft and the
expander shaft, whereas the latter requires an electric generator to
convert the expander shaft power into electricity.

The  choice  of  power  output  type  is  related  to  the  expander
type,  application  object,  and  energy  demand.  If  the  mechanical
power output type is adopted, an elaborate layout between the en-
gine crankshaft, gearbox, and WHR expander is needed to reduce
the transmission loss and meet the space requirements. The elec-
trical power output type makes layout design easy, because elec-
tricity could be sent to various electricity consumers by wires [30] .
In  terms  of  performance,  a  comparison  between  a  mechanically
coupled turbine and a fully electrified turbine was conducted by a
team of BorgWarner and Clemson University [319] . Results showed
that  the  mechanically  coupled  turbine  with  a  constant  gear  ra-

[ 59 , 73 ]. As pointed by Ringler et al. [284] , a 51% net power drop
could  be  observed  when  the  engine  load  declines  from  100%  to
50%.  Therefore,  an  analysis  of  off-design  performance  is  signifi-
cantly important.

Previous  studies  have  observed  the  effects  of  working  fluids
[65] , cycle configurations [325] , operating parameters [ 53 , 95 ] and
component architecture [ 250 , 326 ] on the off-design performance.
Evaporating  pressure  and  working  fluid  flow  rate  are  common
variable operating parameters to obtain optimum RC performance
when it deviates from the design point. Badescu et al. [53] pre-
sented that when an ICE operates at partial load, the net power
output  of  the  WHR-RC  system  could  be  maximized  at  an  opti-
mum working fluid flow rate and evaporating pressure. This op-
erating strategy is also widely adopted in other studies. Regarding
working  fluids,  Kanchibhotla  et  al.  [65]  found  that  fluids  with  a
high boiling point, such as water, may fail to output any power at
low engine load, while fluids with a lower boiling point are capa-
ble of producing additional power at low engine load. Designing
an  RC  system  at  medium  load  instead  of  the  rated  load  of  ICEs
may also alleviate the above issue [327] . Wang et al. [325] com-
pared four RC configurations fueled by the exhaust gas of a nat-
ural gas ICE, and concluded the configuration best matching with
the heat source could behave well at both design and off-design
conditions.  As  for  components,  expander  efficiency  plays  a  deci-
sive role in improving off-design performance, and thus design op-
timization  and  operating  optimization  (variable  rotational  speed
and variable inlet guide vanes) are applied to improve the perfor-
mance characteristics of the expander. Apart from expanders, ev-
idence suggests that heat exchanger architecture also affects the
off-design performance. Chatzopoulou et al. [326] analyzed the off-
design performance of RC systems adopting two different heat ex-
changer types: shell–tube type and plate type. They concluded that
the RC system with a plate heat exchanger behaved better than
that with a shell–tube heat exchanger with respect to off-design
performance.

Compared  with  the  results  at  the  design  condition,  the  opti-
mization results may be more feasible and practical if off-design
performance  is  taken  into  consideration  [ 59 , 328 , 329 ].  Shu  et  al.
[59]  proposed  a  concept  of  average  weighted  net  power  output,
which is obtained by the net power outputs of the RC system at
partial engine loads and the frequency distribution of the selected
engine loads in the operational profile. For the studied case of a
passenger cruise ship, the electricity production cost of the RC sys-
tem increased by 36–41% if off-design performance and operational
profile are included, which also lead to a longer payback period.
A similar concept is also adopted by Guillaume and Lemort [328] ,
and they found that the specific investment cost would increase if
off-design performance is considered.

For  stationary  ICE  applications,  the  thermodynamic  perfor-
mance of the WHR-RC varies strongly over a year, which in turn af-
fects system thermo-economic performance. Several previous case
studies  have  highlighted  the  importance  of  off-design  behavior
in system design, optimization, and evaluation process [ 322 , 330 ].
Considering the off-design behavior, the optimal Rankine cycle sys-
tem with the highest annual electric generation capacity tends to
be  the  system  that  could  operates  for  a  great  number  of  hour
during the year, than the one that outputs highest electric power
at  the  design  stage  [331] .  Markides’s  group  developed  a  mod-
elling tool in the consideration of the off-design behavior of com-
ponents and the interacting characteristics between components,
which could predict Rankine cycle performance over a wide op-
erating conditions [332] . They estimated that power output of the
Rankine cycle is underestimated by up to 17% when the off-design
behavior of these components are not considered [333] . This mod-
elling tool allows for a further comprehensive thermos-economic
analysis of various systems [334] .

6.5. Dynamic response and control

Available  waste  heat  sources  from  ICEs  have  transient  and
highly  variable  characteristics.  Severe  operating  load  changes
would  be  detrimental  to  the  security  of  system  operation
[ 161 , 335 ].  Effective  and  accurate  control  is  necessary  to  ensure
safe, reliable, and optimal operation of the WHR-RC system. The
traditional  steady  model  is  incapable  of  reflecting  the  dynamic
response  process  when  the  external  parameters  change.  Thus,  a
dynamic  model  provides  the  possibility  to  observe  the  dynamic
performance  of  WHR-RCs  and  evaluate  the  feasibility  of  control
schemes. Based on that, the dynamic response of the WHR-RC sys-
tem could be predicted to provide valuable guidance for control
system design.

6.5.1. Dynamic model

The RC is mainly equipped with four components, i.e., an evap-
orator, an expander, a condenser, and a pump. The corresponding
dynamic model is established by the combination of each compo-
nent model according to their interactions. Among these compo-
nents, the pump and expander show faster dynamics than the heat
exchangers (evaporator and condenser), owing to their negligible
mass capacity and thermal inertia [336] . Thus, the pump and ex-
pander are usually modeled using an algebraic formula that avoids
time-dependent variables, [336–338] . Efforts pertaining to the dy-
namic model of the heat exchangers are discussed in this section.
In  general,  two  methods  can  be  applied  to  predict  the  dy-
namic performance of the heat exchangers: the moving boundary
method  [ 44 , 339 , 340 ]  and  finite  volume  method  [ 341 , 342 ].  These
methods  aim  to  establish  equation  sets  of  state  variables  based
on  the  principles  of  mass  and  energy  conservation.  Recently,  an
unconventional method based on fuzzy technology was proposed
[343] .  With  the  help  of  fuzzy  inference  technology,  this  method
focuses on the relationship between input and output rather than
the internal physics laws. The fuzzy model needs imported data
(obtained from experimental data or simulation results of the for-
mer two methods) as learning samples.

Table 9 shows the comparison results of these three dynamic

methods.

The  moving  boundary  model  divides  heat  exchangers  into  a
three-zone heat unit, usually a subcooling zone, two-phase zone,
and superheating zone, as shown in Fig. 32 (a). The conservation
differential equations are integrated over each region and a set of
equations can be naturally formed by their combination. Therein,
the length of each region is time-dependent and other state vari-
ables (such as enthalpy and pressure) are calculated and updated
simultaneously  [339] .  The  moving  boundary  model  is  applicable
for the heat exchangers existing multiple phases, such as the evap-
orator and condenser in the subcritical RC system. It is noted that
changes in the system state may result in the appearance and dis-
appearance of zones. Thus, several contributions [ 340 , 344 ] based
on the switching approach were made to handle the correspond-
ing situation. R. Huster et al. [345] proposed a dynamic RC model,
in which the moving boundary model is applied for the heat ex-
changers, for waste heat recovery from a diesel engine. This model
was successfully validated using experimental transient measure-
ment data and proven to be capable of capturing dynamic charac-
teristics with less than 4% mean relative deviation.

As for the finite volume method, the heat exchangers are dis-
cretized  into  several  cells  as  shown  in  Fig.  32 b.  The  conserva-
tion equations in those cells are arranged to form a set of equa-
tions and the state space representation of the exchanger is then
determined.  The  number  of  cells  strongly  affects  the  simulation
performance  of  the  model.  As  a  trade-off of  time  consumption
and  calculation  accuracy,  the  number  is  usually  taken  as  20–30
[ 342 , 346 ]. The finite volume method is adaptable for the variation

of the fluid phase and applicable for the subcritical and transcrit-
ical systems. However, some numerical issues, such as oscillation
and failure, are frequently found in this method. These are caused
by discontinuities in the fluid thermophysical properties, especially
near the liquid or vapor saturation point. Quoilin et al. [347] pre-
sented six strategies (mean densities, enthalpy limiter, smooth re-
versal enthalpy, smoothing methods, truncation, and filtering) to
solve  this  problem  and  improve  the  robustness  of  the  method.
They concluded that these strategies could ensure failure-free sim-
ulation, even under highly transient conditions. Recently, Xu et al.
[348] presented a similar finite volume method without the cell
discretization,  named  the  0-D  lumped  method,  and  pointed  out
that it has comparable accuracy with the moving boundary model
and only slightly worse than the finite volume model.

These two methods are highly capable of reflecting the physical
process inside the heat exchanger, but limited to realize real-time
control owing to its time-intensive computation. Thus, some schol-
ars [ 343 , 349 ] employed the fuzzy method to reduce computations
along with the effective capturing of transient characteristics. The
fuzzy method can be seen as a type of black box for only reflect-

puts with ignorance of the specific physical process (as shown in
Fig. 32 c). This model is obtained by learning from sample data and
is born with good improvement potential. Actually, it shows a flex-
ible ability for real-time control. Unfortunately, the accuracy of this
method is limited by the representativeness of the training data.

6.5.2. Dynamic response

A deep understanding of the dynamic response characteristic is
a prerequisite of system control design. For a clearer comparison,
the settling time and time constant are commonly used to quanti-
tatively describe the dynamic response speed. Settling time is the
time  consumed  for  the  step  response  to  reach  or  stay  within  a
range of certain percentage of the final value (usually 5% or 2%).
Time constant is the time for the step response to reach 1 − 1/e ≈
63.2% of the final value. A shorter settling time and time constant
imply a faster dynamic response of the system.

Prior  studies  have  examined  and  compared  the  dynamic  re-
sponse  characteristic  under  various  working  fluids  [337] ,  de-
sign parameters [ 350 , 351 ], and cycle configurations [352–354] . As
pointed out by Shu et al. [337] , there are multiple properties af-
fecting  the  dynamic  response  speed  of  working  fluids.  Compari-
son results indicated that low heat capacity, small evaporation la-
tent heat, low critical temperature, and low density seem to con-
tribute  to  a  fast  dynamic  response.  This  conclusion  is  in  agree-
ment with the results by Li et al. [354] that CO
2 -based RCs per-
form better than R123-based ORC system in terms of dynamic per-
formance. Furthermore, evidence suggests that cycle configuration
also affects the dynamic response. Adding a thermal oil medium
cycle between the exhaust gas heat source and the RC system has
been proven effective to improve the system resistance to external
perturbations [ 102 , 353 ]. Recently, Li et al. [354] carried on a pre-
2  transcritical power cy-
liminary dynamic experiment on the CO
cle (CTPC). Four cycle configurations, i.e., basic CTPC (B-CTPC), pre-
heating CTPC (P-CTPC), regenerative CTPC (R-CTPC), and preheating
regenerative CTPC (PR-CTPC), were compared using the indicators
of time constant and settling time. Fig. 33 shows the dynamic re-
sponse comparison results of the four systems. PR-CTPC  has the
steepest average transient slope, indicating the fastest dynamic re-
sponses to the pump speed change (working fluid flow change).
P-CTPC has a faster dynamic response than R-CTPC. The authors
attributed this to the gas–liquid heat exchanger. As for cycle de-
sign parameters, Wang et al. [350] investigated the effect of three
design parameters (evaporation pressure, condensing pressure, and
exhaust outlet temperature) on the system dynamic performance,
and concluded that no obvious effect could be observed. Thus, the
same PID controller is expected to achieve satisfactory control per-
formance in cases with different design parameters. On the con-
trary, engine working condition is observed to strongly influence
the dynamic performance. With the decrease in the engine loads,
the response speed of the RC system becomes slow and control
improvement is required for better performance.

6.5.3. Control

The control of the WHR-RC system for an ICE may face chal-
lenges  because  of  the  highly  transient  behavior  of  heat  sources.
An  effective  control  strategy  and  controller  is  of  significance  to

maximize  power  output  and  to  ensure  safe  and  reliable  opera-
tion. Previous studies indicated that the WHR-RC system could ob-
tain satisfactory performance only under a narrow range of oper-
ating pressure and temperature. Thus, the common control objects
include operating pressure (evaporating pressure and condensing
pressure  in  the  subcritical  cycle,  or  cycle  high  pressure  and  cy-
cle low pressure in the transcritical cycle) and operating temper-
ature (superheat in the subcritical cycle or turbine inlet tempera-
ture in the transcritical cycle). The controllable variables are gen-
erally the expander rotational speed [ 161 , 342 , 353 , 355 ] for adjust-
ing the operating pressure and temperature, pump rotational speed
[ 44 , 161 , 342 , 353 , 355 ] for adjusting the working fluid flow rate, and
water pump (fan) rotational speed [ 44 , 161 ] for adjusting the water
(air) flow rate entering the condenser. Furthermore, several bypass
valves may be installed in the systems to ensure safe operation by
diverting a portion of the exhaust gas or working fluid flow, espe-
cially in start-up mode or stop mode. The on/off statuses of these
valves are also controllable variables [ 161 , 355 , 356 ].

Several attempts have been made to design a control scheme
based on the common PID control strategy and improved PID con-
trol strategies, such as classical PID control [ 44 , 161 , 357 ], PI-based
decentralized control [342] , and gain-scheduled PID control [358] .
These  studies  obtain  desirable  system  performance  by  adjusting
controllable  variables  to  the  optimal  value,  which  is  determined
by the steady optimization process. Common PID control is easy
to implement, but also face challenges. Because of the poor anti-
interference ability, common PID control might not always achieve
satisfactory performance owing to nonlinearities and highly tran-
sient  heat  sources.  Recently,  a  considerable  number  of  studies
have  been  published  on  the  theme  of  using  an  advanced  con-
trol  strategy,  including  linear/nonlinear  model  predictive  control
(MPC) [359–364] , model-based two-degree of freedom (2DOF) con-
trol [ 365 , 366 ], multivariable predictive control [ 367 , 368 ], optimal
control [ 356 , 369 , 370 ], and minimum variance control [371] . Exper-
imental and simulation results by Xu et al. [ 372 , 373 ] indicated that

nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) plus extended Kalman
filter (EKF) outperforms a multiple loop PID in terms of tracking
error, settling time and safety under the transient engine condi-
tion. Additionally, the majority of these studies confirmed that ad-
vanced  controls  behave  better  than  common  PID  controls  under
highly transient heat sources.

Owing  to  the  variable  engine  load  and  highly  transient  heat
sources, the operating mode of WHR-RCs could be categorized into
stop  mode,  power  mode,  and  startup  mode.  In  stop  mode,  the
waste heat energy is inadequate to drive the WHR-RC system and
waste heat from the ICE is rejected into the environment. When
the waste heat source temperature is higher than a preset startup
value and is maintained for a certain period of time, the WHR-RC
system switches from stop mode to startup mode. In startup mode,
WHR-RCs complete the startup of the pump and the turbine, and
ensure their stable operation near the set values. After that, the
WHR-RC enters power mode, in which a control strategy is imple-
mented to ensure the WHR-RC can operate safely and efficiently.
When the waste heat energy is again insufficient, the WHR-RC may
switch to stop mode.

To the exclusion of startup mode and stop mode, several stud-
ies have reported the application and comparison of advanced con-
trol strategies in power mode. [ 357 , 365 , 374 ]. Grelet et al. [357] de-
veloped  a  control  oriented  model  for  the  WHR-RC  and  com-
pared a classical PID controller with a nonlinear model-based con-
troller under transient heat source of an 11 L long-haul truck un-
der  a  highway  driving  cycle.  They  concluded  that  the  nonlinear
model  based  controller  performed  better  because  the  PID  con-
troller showed an obvious delay in comparison with the nonlin-
ear model-based controller. D. Seitz et al. [365] presented a non-
linear  dynamic  feedforward  controller  based  on  an  exact  inver-
sion of the dynamic evaporator model. Online parameter adapta-
tion  of  heat  transfer  coefficients  enhanced  steady-state  accuracy
and compensated for model uncertainties. The improvements and
applicability  of  the  proposed  controller  in  vehicular  applications

have been demonstrated under realistic highway traffic conditions.
A comparison of control performance among a controller without
feedforward (S1), a feedforward controller (S2), and a feedforward
controller with online parameter adaptation (S3) indicates that a
feedforward part (S2 and S3) could obviously improve control per-
formance  and  S3  requires  much  fewer  corrections  by  the  feed-
back part than S2. Similarly, Chen et al. [374] proposed and com-
pared three control strategies: feedback control, feedforward con-
trol, and feedback–feedforward combined control. They found that
the control strategy with the feedforward part is suitable for low-
frequency variation of the heat source. Rathod et al. [375] designed
superheat-tracking nonlinear model predictive controller using an
extended Kalman filter (NMPC-EKF) as a state estimator. The per-
formance of the proposed controller was experimentally evaluated
under the transient drive cycle, and the mean superheat tracking
error was 2.9 °C. Meanwhile, this controller was proved to have
ample time to complete the calculation and provide optimal con-
trol inputs under the transient drive cycle, which is conducive to
real-time  control.  In  power  mode,  when  the  waste  heat  energy
is inadequate to drive the WHR-RC system, two options are com-
monly used: bypassing the expander for safety [ 376 , 377 ] or shut-
ting down the system to avoid unnecessary pump power consump-
tion [324] .

In practice, WHR-RCs would inevitably experience start-up and
shut-down.  Thus,  startup  mode  and  shut-down  mode  should  be
taken  into  account,  however,  they  are  not  yet  fully  studied.  Xie
et al. [377] analyzed the operating process of RCs under a com-
plete drive cycle and defined four basic operating modes of RCs:
startup mode, expander turning mode, power mode, and protec-
tion  mode.  In  startup  mode,  the  RCs  get  started  when  the  ICEs
operate steadily. Working fluid would be bypassed until it is com-
pletely evaporated to superheated condition. They concluded that
operating mode switching would result in on-road RC inefficiency
(less than half of the design efficiency). Li et al. [161] also defined
three  operating  modes,  namely  startup  mode,  power  mode,  and
stop  mode.  The  authors  designed  a  two-loop  control  scheme,  in
which the outer loop specializes in mode switching and the inner
loop is designed for actuators and power control. In this mode, the
working fluid pump and the cooling water pump are turned on at
an initial value. The expander would not start until the expander
inlet pressure rises to the preset value and is maintained for a cer-
tain period of time.

Considering WHR-RCs coupled into ICEs, several interesting at-
tempts  have  been  made  to  integrate  WHR-RC  control  into  ICE
control  [378–380] .  Galuppo  et  al.  [378]  conducted  an  evaluation
of WHR-RCs coupled with a mild-hybrid driveline in a long-haul
heavy-duty  truck.  The  mild-hybrid  architecture  contains  a  48  V
electric generator/motor unit, 48 V battery, power electronic unit,
a battery control unit, and a controller of the electric machine in-
cluded in the engine control unit. Based on this, the authors com-
pared the direct and indirect condensation configurations of an RC
system  under  highway  drive  cycle  and  concluded  that  the  indi-
rect condensation reaches higher performance levels in comparison
with the direct condensation (from 4 to 6 %) and approximately
60% of the total recovered energy is obtained from RCs. Feru et al.
[379] presented an integrated power-train control (IPC) to manage
energy and emissions for a Euro-VI diesel engine with an electri-
fied WHR system. The integrated powertrain control contains ICE,
after-treatment  system,  WHR-RC  system,  and  electric  system,  as
displayed  in  Fig.  34 .  This  control  scheme  includes  engine  maps
for fueling, PID controllers for required urea dosing and switching
model predictive control for WHR-RCs. Three different powertrain
configurations, including without a WHR system, with a WHR sys-
tem, and with a WHR system coupled with a battery for energy
storage,  were  compared  and  evaluated  under  the  world  harmo-
nized transient cycle for cold-start and hot-start conditions. They

system and the battery can provide an additional 3.5% CO
sion reduction and 19% particulate matter reduction while satisfy-
ing the NOx emission constraint.

7. Summary, challenges, and research opportunities

Although the past decade has seen the rapid development of
Rankine cycle for WHR from ICEs (ICE-WHRs), progress must still
be made toward commercialization. Major challenges of Rankine
cycle in ICE-WHR from cycle configuration, working fluid, system
integration, and control are discussed in this section. Suggestions
and research direction based on the authors’ theoretical and engi-
neering experience are given.

(1) Safe, environmentally friendly, and highly efficient working
fluid for ICE-WHR: from passive selection to active design

Suitable working fluids for Rankine cycles in ICE-WHR should
be  safe,  environmentally  friendly,  and  efficient.  Existing  refriger-
ants cannot meet these requirements. Previous studies have proven
2 could improve the per-
that C x H y O z and siloxanes as well as CO
formance of basic Rankine cycle to some extent. However, the ap-
plication of C x H y O z and siloxanes as well as CO
2 would introduce
new issues, such as the flammability of C x H y O z and siloxanes and
cooling of CO
2 . In spite of using these working fluids, the gap be-
tween actual Rankine cycle and the H-iCycle is still obvious.

Nearly 60 pure substances are commonly used as working flu-
ids of Rankine cycle in ICE-WHR, but it is difficult to find a single
fluid that can satisfy all the requirements. Previous studies were
devoted to the passive selection of working fluids by massive cal-
culation and trial. To break this bottleneck, new methods are re-
quired to actively design working fluids based on the requirements.
CAMD [166] and mixtures [ 381 , 382 ] promise to achieve this goal,
as shown in Fig. 35 . In theory, mixtures could exhibit specific prop-
erties by adjusting compositions and ratios, which provide oppor-
tunities  to  obtain  suitable  working  fluids  for  ICE-WHR  by  active
design. For example, mixtures hold the potential to leverage the
complementary strengths of C x H y O z and siloxanes as well as CO
2 .
Moreover,  CAMD  could  be  used  to  generate  a  great  number  of
novel substances that may meet the requirements as the working
fluid for Rankine cycles in ICE-WHR. In this way, the massive time

and cost required by experimental work on novel working fluid ex-
ploration could be greatly reduced.

The major challenge remaining for the active design of working
fluids is the determination of desirable physical properties charac-
teristics, as there are multiple and complex correlations among the
physical properties of working fluids and the system performance
requirements.  Although  several  works  have  been  devoted  to  the
effect  of  physical  properties  of  working  fluids  on  system  perfor-
mance [ 109 , 337 ], more fundamental research is needed to provide
a comprehensive understanding of these multiple correlations. An-
other recommendation is the development of advanced decision-
making tools, which sufficiently enable the determination of desir-
able physical properties and characteristics under multiple perfor-
mance requirements.

adopted to utilize high-grade waste heat in the high-temperature
cycle, whereas traditional refrigerants and their mixtures are rec-
ommended for low-grade waste heat in the low-temperature cycle.
Such systems are highly recommended for large-capacity station-
ary ICEs and marine ICEs, which have fewer requirements for the
size and weight.

As  for  vehicular  applications,  in  which  downsizing  and  light
weight is the primary concern, multiloop systems show less poten-
tial. Single-loop Rankine cycle modified by the regeneration pro-
cess are more suitable. According to the principle of “energy uti-
lization according to quality,” one issue remained with respect to
single-loop Rankine cycle design is to build an efficient heat trans-
fer network aiming at the composite heat source profile. Novel re-
generation processes, such as split regeneration [383] and multiple
regenerations [ 179 , 384 ], should be investigated.

Owing to the large temperature gradient and different energy
grade  of  waste  heat  sources,  several  novel  cycle  configurations
have been proposed to achieve satisfactory thermal matching and
cycle performance. According to previous analyses in this review,
the  current  cycle  configuration  modifications  of  Rankine  cycles
for  various  ICEs  applications  are  displayed  in  Fig.  36 .  Multiloop
Rankine  cycles,  including  Cascade  Rankine  cycle  and  Dual  pres-
sure Rankine cycles, could achieve the highest thermodynamic per-
fection (up to 62.3%). Multiloop Rankine cycle design is supposed

(1) Integrated scheme from component design, systems integra-

tion, and energy management

Most of the previous studies only focused on Rankine cycle it-
self, and very little work has been devoted to the integrated design
research. From the standpoint of practicality, the WHR-RC system
is supposed to be designed to integrate well with a target ICE from
the aspects of component design, system integration, and energy
management,  together  with  meeting  requirements  of  downsiz-

34

H. Tian, P. Liu and G. Shu

tion concerns enables us to gain a comprehensive understanding
and assessment of Rankine cycle in ICE-WHR. Some major conclu-
sions are drawn as follows:

1. Working  fluid  selection  is  a  critical  issue  for  Rankine  cycle
in  ICE-WHR.  According  to  the  analysis  results  in  this  review,
traditional  refrigerant-based  Rankine  cycle  in  ICE-WHR  could
achieve a thermodynamic perfection of 14.4–38.2%. The appli-
cation  of  this  technology  faces  major  obstacles:  environmen-
tal issues, unreliable operation, and unsatisfactory performance.
C x H y O z and siloxanes as well as CO
2 may partially alleviate the
above problems. In particular, C x H y O z and siloxanes with a high
critical  temperature  (such  as  cyclohexane,  benzene,  toluene,
and  MM)  have  a  satisfactory  thermal  matching  with  waste
heat  sources  and  yield  high  thermodynamic  perfection  of  up
to 54.1%. Unfortunately, they introduce new issues, such as the
flammability of C x H y O z  and siloxanes and a cooling difficulty
of CO
2 . Thus, zeotropic mixtures hold the potential to leverage
the complementary strengths of C x H y O z and siloxanes as well
as CO

2 .

2. Three  major  cycle  configuration  modification  methods,
Regeneration  based-modification  (R-RCs),  Cascade  based-
modification(C-RCs),  and  Dual  pressure  cycle-modification
(D-RCs), were reviewed. The positive effect of the regeneration
process  on  Rankine  cycle  performance  was  discussed.  R-RCs
present  a  promising  research  direction  for  space-constrained
applications,  such  as  vehicular  ICEs.  C-RCs  and  D-RCs  are
supposed  to  follow  the  principle  of  “energy  utilization  ac-
cording  to  quality,” meaning  that  C x H y O z  and  siloxanes  and
CO
2  are  adopted  to  utilize  high-grade  waste  heat  in  the  HT
cycle,  whereas  traditional  refrigerants  are  recommended  for
low-grade waste heat in the LT cycle. Analysis results indicate
that  C-RCs  and  D-RCs  are  expected  to  achieve  the  highest
thermodynamic  perfection  of  62.3%.  Thus,  they  are  highly
recommended  for  applications  with  fewer  size  and  weight
requirements, such as marine ICEs and stationary ICEs.

3. Heat transfer exchangers associated with Rankine cycles in ICE-
WHR  are  categorized  into  evaporators,  preheaters,  and  con-
densers/regenerators.  Various  heat  exchanger  types  and  heat
transfer enhancement methods are analyzed and investigated.
The  shell–tube-type  heat  exchanger  would  be  more  applica-
ble as an evaporator, whereas the plate-type heat exchanger is
recommended for regenerators and condensers. Advanced heat
transfer enhancement methods, including metal foam heat ex-
changers and microchannel heat exchangers, face clogging is-
sues caused by particle deposits in the exhaust gas.

4. Expanders are the core component in WHR-RCs. From the as-
pect of power range, turbines and screw expanders could be the
most suitable candidates for large-scale marine and stationary
applications. As for automobile applications, turbines seem to
be most promising, but they still face challenges, such as un-
reasonably small blade height, low efficiency, undesirable off-
design performance, and high rotational speed. More research is
encouraged on several technique improvements, including par-
tial admission, variable inlet guide vane, high-ratio transmission
gearbox, high-speed generator, and advanced bearing and seal-
ing technology.

5. The  control  of  the  WHR-RC  system  for  ICE  faces  challenges
because of the highly transient behavior of heat sources. Ad-
vanced  control  strategies  have  been  proven  to  contribute  to
safe operation and system performance. However, there is still a
huge gap between theoretical simulations and practical testing.
A better understanding of the dynamic response characteristic
and operating condition recognition is suggested to provide sci-
entific guidance for control system design. More studies are en-

ing and compactness. Promising integrated design schemes at the
component  level  include  turbine–generator–pump  integrated  de-
sign, heat transfer/noise elimination/diesel particulate filter (DPF)
integrated  design  [ 385 , 386 ],  and  heat  transfer/three-way  catalyst
(TWC) integrated design [387] . From the system integration level,
the  deep  integration  with  ICEs  tends  to  accelerate  the  commer-
cialization  of  the  WHR-RCs.  Possible  research  topic  involves  the
cooling loop integration of ICEs and RCs, substituting EGR cooler,
and pipe layout optimization scheme. Moreover, although there are
existing strategies for the energy coupling of RC and ICEs, as re-
viewed in Section 6.3 , there are some gaps in the theoretical and
technical knowledge. The coupling mechanism of power output be-
tween  the  heavy-duty  engine  and  the  expander  is  still  unclear.
Some  key  components,  such  as  high-ratio  transmission  gearbox
and high-speed generator, are still under development. In terms of
energy management, the major challenge is the compromise be-
tween accuracy and calculation time. Most of the existing energy
management strategies pursue accurate control performance by in-
creasing the complexity of the model. However, increasing com-
plexity results in a longer calculation time, thus leading to the fail-
ure of real-time management.

(1) Coordinative control based on operating working condition

recognition

ICEs always operate with variable working conditions, provid-
ing a transient heat source for Rankine cycles. Thus, the control
of WHR-RCs remains a major challenge. Although a number of re-
searchers have provided important information on the control per-
formance  of  various  control  strategies,  more  studies  are  needed
to formulate a practical and reliable control scheme. One of the
promising research directions is the coordinative control aiming at
the ICE’s whole operational profile. A possible coordinative control
scheme  is  presented  in  Fig.  37 .  In  this  scheme,  the  control  sys-
tem is capable of recognizing the operating conditions of the ICE
and selecting a suitable control strategy accordingly. Further stud-
ies should pay attention to the definition and distinction of various
operating conditions.

8. Concluding remarks

Rankine cycle provides promising solution for WHR from ICEs
(ICE-WHR), which could balance efficiency and practicality. In this
review, recent advances on Rankine cycles for ICE-WHR were sum-
marized. For a fair evaluation of results from various existing stud-
ies, a uniform evaluation standard, thermodynamic perfection, was
proposed based on the benchmark of the heat source based ideal
thermodynamic cycle(H-iCycle), which is determined by achieving
ideal thermal matching to external boundary conditions. Based on
this, this paper critically reviews the recent progress in filling the
gap between the H-iCycle and the Basic Rankine cycles with re-
spect  to  the  aspects  of  working  fluids,  cycle  configuration,  and
key components. In addition, a discussion about several applica-
