Concentrating solar power coupled to thermal energy storage (TES) is a vastly growing industrial process
allowing for the generation of dispatchable and green electricity. This paper focuses on direct molten salt
line-focusing technology using linear Fresnel and parabolic trough collector systems. Direct molten salt
technology utilizes molten salt as heat transfer fluid in solar field and TES medium. Nitrate salts can be
applied since they cover a wide temperature range. As storage medium Solar Salt, a binary NaNO3 (cid:1) KNO3
(60(cid:1)40 wt%) mixture, is most commonly used but variations of this system have promising thermal proper-
ties in terms of a lower melting temperature to minimize the risk of undesired salt freezing events. These
modified salts are typically ternary, ternary reciprocal or higher order systems formed by adding additional
cations, anions or both. In this study five molten salt systems Solar Salt, HitecXL (CaKNa//NO3), LiNaK-
Nitrate, Hitec (NaK//NO23) and CaLiNaK//NO23 are both investigated and critically reviewed. Their thermo-
physical properties including phase diagrams, composition, melting ranges, melting temperature, minimum
operation temperature, thermal stability, maximum operation temperature, density, heat capacity, thermal
conductivity, viscosity and handling are evaluated and the most recommended values are discussed and
highlighted. This review contributes to a better understanding of how the listed properties can be deter-
mined in terms of measurement conditions and provides temperature dependent data useful for future sim-
ulations of direct molten salt LF CSP plants.

1. Introduction

PConcentrating Solar Power (CSP) plants convert sunlight into
thermal energy by increasing the solar radiation flux density to
achieve high temperatures and high energy conversion efficiencies.
CSP plants have been and still are one of the most rapidly growing
commercial technologies. The installation of power plants in the mid
80’s and 90’s in California with a total of 354 MWel has been one of
the key milestones. [1] At the time of writing this article, the electric
capacity of CSP plants has been increasing to more than 5GWel,
worldwide and is expected to further increase by installations
planned especially in the middle and far east.

PCompared to other power plants the number of individual com-
ponents is high, making CSP a complicated but versatile process. [2]
The production of thermal energy makes it unique compared to the
other renewable energy technologies and offers “intrinsic compati-
bility with thermal hybridization and thermal storage” as described
at length elsewhere. [2] Thermal energy is generated by a solar col-
lector system (e.g. a heliostat field) that reflects direct normal irradi-
ation towards a thermal receiver system, where optical energy is
converted to thermal energy. This energy can be used to drive a
superheat steam cycle or directly be stored in a thermal energy stor-
age unit. The different types of CSP configurations known to date,
available types of thermal energy storage (TES) as well as the materi-
als used during heat conversion and storage will be introduced here-
after. The main focus of this work is to review available and novel
heat transfer fluids based on molten nitrate salts, their thermo-phys-
ical properties and finally recommend a list of values to be used for
future reference. Readers interested in a deeper insight into optical
principles, CSP applications and their value are referred to other
publications, e.g. the overview of Gauch(cid:1)e et al. [2] published
recently.

1.1. Concentrating solar power plants

PA number of concentrator configurations, as shown in Fig. 1 is
known to-date in CSP applications and two groups are differenti-
ated: Line-focusing (LF) and point-focusing (PF) systems. Installed

Ppower plants of the first group are dominated by parabolic trough
systems, which exhibit higher collector efficiencies than Fresnel sys-
tems, which in turn are expected to reduce capital costs. [3(cid:1)6] The
parabolic trough concept uses parabolic mirrors to focus sunlight
onto an evacuated tube receiver, with mirror and tube following the
daily movement of the sun (see Fig. 2). Linear Fresnel systems use
individual plane mirrors to focus sunlight on a (downward-facing)
tube receiver.

PBoth systems have in common that the heat transfer fluid is
pumped through a relatively large solar field before entering the
steam generator or the storage unit. Currently, the 280 MWel-Sol-
ana-, 250 MWel-Mojave Solar- and the 250 MWel-Genesis Solar plant
are the largest operational parabolic trough plants world-wide (see
e.g. the comprehensive review by Weinstein et al. [7]). A 360 MWel
trough-power plant is under construction in Chile with an estimated
start-up by the end of 2017. Typical operating temperatures of LF
plants are between 290(cid:1)390 °C with peak and annual average con-
version efficiencies of 14(cid:1)20% and 13(cid:1)15%, respectively [8].

PTo date, no large-scale commercial power plant utilizing direct
molten salts storage is available to our best knowledge, but is under
investigation in the CSP market (see also ref. [6,9] and literature
cited therein). In particular, the technology was thoroughly investi-
gated by Sandia National Laboratories [10] and ENEA [11] in pilot
scale plants using sodium and potassium nitrates (Solar Salt).

PCentral receiver systems are typically based on two-axial mirror
(heliostats) systems that allow for high concentration ratios and
higher temperatures in the receiver (solar tower or dish systems)
compared to LF systems. Point focusing systems such as solar tower
systems using molten salt as heat transfer fluid have first been dem-
onstrated in the THEMIS project (France) in the 80’s and the Solar
Two project (USA) in the 90’s (Fig. 2) as well as more recently on a
relevant industrial scale such as the 110 MWel-Crescent Dunes- or
the 377 MWel-Ivanpah power plants. In contrast to line-focusing sys-
tems high solar concentration ratios increase the maximum applica-
ble operating temperature which benefits the power block, making
this type of CSP-TES combination the most advanced at the moment.
The high operation temperature between 290 and 565 °C result in
higher peak (23(cid:1)35%) and annual conversion efficiencies (14(cid:1)18%)

Psystems are close to the existing Solar Salt upper limit of 565 °C or
lower. These optimum temperatures are defined by optical efficien-
cies of the solar field.

1.2. State-of-the-art in thermal energy storage for CSP

PThermal energy storage (TES) is a key element of CSP power
plants since it is among few techniques offering dispatchable elec-
tricity in the MW-scale [17]. Moreover, no additional requirements
are met for the existing electrical grid, making CSP-TES a perfectly
integrated solution. General integration concepts have been pro-
posed and are well summarized e.g. by Steinmann [18]: The storage
unit is typically connected to the solar collector (solar tower, linear
Fresnel, parabolic trough unit, etc.) [19] as well as to the thermal
cycle (typically a steam turbine). Operation during sunlight allows
for a direct operation of the thermal cycle, with surplus energy being
stored in the TES unit. During discharging energy from the TES unit
is used to heat the working fluid of the thermal cycle. Several advan-
tages may arise from that:

P(cid:3) The capacity factor can be increased from 20 to 25% for CSP
without TES, up to 60(cid:1)85% for (PF) CSP coupled with a TES unit
[20]

P(cid:3) Part load operation is reduced significantly
P(cid:3) Maximum revenue can be generated by shifting electricity-gen-

eration to “peak demand times”.

PDeveloping a storage system requires for profound knowledge of
the existing heat flows, between absorber and storage unit, as well
as storage unit and thermal cycle during charging and discharging,
respectively. A consideration of the different types of solar collec-
tors, described before is essential herein.

PAlthough different types of TES such as sensible heat in solids,
latent heat and thermo-chemical storage exist [21(cid:1)24], sensible
heat storage in liquids is most commonly applied in current CSP
power plants. In CSP TES systems with thermal oil, molten salt and
pressurized water were examined. Most importantly, this technol-
ogy can be divided into direct or indirect storage technologies (see e.
g. ref. [25] and literature cited therein) as shown in Fig. 3 both being
typical options in point- and LF CSP plants, respectively.

PDirect storage in mineral oil (e.g. Therminol VP-1 or Helisol(cid:1) 5A)
up to 300 °C has been applied e.g. in the SEGS-I power plant built in
1984 in California, using parabolic trough-shaped receivers [16]. It is
possible to increase the temperature from 300 °C with mineral oil to
400 °C with synthetic oil. Costs of mineral oil could be acceptable
whereas costs of synthetic oil are typically not acceptable for TES.
Despite the advantage of having only a single circulating fluid which

Pthan LF plants [15]. This is especially related to the different power
block fluid conditions and thus power cycle efficiencies (37.7% in LF
vs. 41.6% in PF systems, see ref. [8] and literature cited therein).

PThe principle of concentrating and absorbing solar energy ulti-
mately requires for a transportation of heat to a power block or heat
exchanger. With the aim of achieving high operating temperatures,
which are beneficial for the efficiency of the power block, demands
for heat transfer fluids (HTFs) with wide operating-temperature
ranges are created. At the same time, the type of solar concentrator
used limits the choice of suitable HTFs. This issue becomes especially
clear when looking at the existing technologies and HTFs used. Line-
focusing CSP plants use thermal oils in a temperature range from
below 0 °C up to 400 °C while power tower systems use molten
nitrate salts operating between 290 °C and 565 °C. The reason for the
different choice of HTFs is the design of the CSP unit itself. While in
PF systems the HTF is pumped only from the tank into the close-by
solar tower, in LF CSP systems it must be pumped through kilome-
ter-long pipe networks of each solar collector assembly (e.g. > 50
km in SEGS I [16]). If the freezing point of the HTF is above ambient
temperatures the risk of freezing events in the receiver tubes
increases dramatically, especially whenever sunlight is absent. In PF
CSP systems the number of absorber pipes is significantly lower and
HTFs with high melting points can be utilized with a lower risk of
failure and a reduced demand for preheating. Ultimately, these are
the reasons why molten salts are not as easily applicable in LF sys-
tems while they are state-of-the-art in PF CSP plants. For LF CSP
plants, trace heating or daily drainage of the receiver tubes is techni-
cally possible to avoid freezing events but not desired for LF systems
with molten salt (e.g. cost of trace heating). Therefore significant
effort is made to identify new molten nitrate salt mixtures with low
melting points. Desired maximum temperatures for LF molten salt

Palso serves as heat storage medium, drawbacks are the synthetic oil
price, its thermal stability of up to about 400 °C and pressurized
design above 300 °C as well as potential environmental hazards
upon leakage and flammability and make this type of storage unat-
tractive for nowadays applications.

PTo reduce the costs of the working fluids thermal oil is retained as
HTF but replaced with molten salt as storage medium (typically
Solar Salt - a 60(cid:1)40 wt% NaNO3 (cid:1) KNO3 -mixture). This configura-
tion is referred to as indirect storage configuration which requires
for an additional heat exchanger between thermal oil (HTF) and mol-
ten salt (storage medium) as schematically shown in Fig. 3. This con-
cept is still state-of-the-art and most commonly utilized in modern
parabolic trough CSP plants. Yet, a complete replacement of thermal
oil by Solar Salt is desirable for several reasons. The output tempera-
ture of the Solar Field can be increased to 450(cid:1)500 °C which
increases the efficiency of the power block (see e.g. Gonz(cid:1)alez-Rou-
baud et al. [8] and literature cited therein). The successively higher
DT increases the storage capacity (Q) per volume which is defined by
Q1⁄2kJ(cid:4) D m ¢ cp ¢ DT
ð1Þ
where m in [kg] is the mass of the storage medium, cp in [kJ/kg ¢ K] is
its heat capacity (typically constant over temperature) and DT is the
applied temperature difference between the hot and cold tank.
Accordingly, for a constant mass of storage material the storage
capacity increases linearly with increasing DT; in other words for a
constant storage capacity the required storage mass can be
decreased. This allows for capital cost reduction of the thermal
energy storage system. At the same time molten salts are signifi-
cantly cheaper than synthetic thermal oils and a double investment
of thermal oil as heat transfer fluid and molten salt as storage
medium is avoided.

POverall, several authors showed that higher operation tempera-
tures, larger temperature differences and replacement of oil of the
direct molten salt system lead to reduced Levelized Costs of Electric-
ity (LCOE) [2,18,26]. In addition molten salts have advantages in
terms of handling (e.g. low environmental impact) compared to oil.
Technically however, a complete replacement of thermal oil by mol-
ten nitrate salts resembles a significant challenge since molten salts
exhibit a significantly higher melting point with the risk of salt freez-
ing and/or filling/drainage of the solar field tubes compared to ther-
mal oils (e.g. 240 °C for Solar Salt compared to ¡60 °C for Helisol(cid:1) 5A
[27].). At this point the operation principle of LF CSP plants is disad-
vantageous compared to PF ones and substantial effort is made in
replacing thermal oils and eventually implementing molten salts as
working fluids to increase the solar-to-electricity efficiency of the LF
CSP plant. Additionally, different publications have proposed that
investment costs can be reduced significantly when classical Solar
Salt, a 60(cid:1)40 wt% mixture of NaNO3 (cid:1) KNO3; is replaced by molten
salts with a lower melting point [24,28(cid:1)31]. Kelly and Kearney [32]
suggest that capacity specific costs for a direct molten salt storage
system are around 50% lower compared to an indirect storage sys-
tem due to reduced tank sizes and the absence of a costly heat
exchanger, mainly.

1.3. Nitrate salts as working fluids

PNitrate salts have been well known as heat transfer media in the
processing industry [37], with the first established salt being Hitec
HTS ðNaNO2 (cid:1) NaNO3 (cid:1) KNO3; 40-7-53 wt%) developed by DuPont
in 1938 and extensively characterized by Kirst et al. [35] in 1940. In
the 1970’s and 1980’s the interest in molten salts for CSP applica-
tions grew dramatically. However, despite nitrate/nitrite salts being
used in industrial processes to a significant extent, documentation
of experiences has been scarce. Carling and Mar [37] were one of the
first collecting data from production plants utilizing nitrates, nitrites
or mixtures of both, as heat transfer fluids mainly. The widespread

Pof applications ranges from organic syntheses, to sodium nitrate pro-
duction, caustic concentrators and metal treatment. As a short sum-
mary, their discussion with the plant technicians demonstrated that
no consensus existed on the treatment of the molten salts. For exam-
ple, some plants used protective atmospheres for the storage of
Hitec-salt, while others used a N2/CO2 gas mixture or atmospheric
gas. Regeneration of molten salts was typically carried out by re-
addition of the salt mixture or one of its components after defined
time intervals. Continuous salt analysis was however carried out in
all cases as a precaution, typically by measuring the melting point
over time, or the salt composition and pH after dissolution in water
to measure chemical changes in the salt. The experiences gained
served as a basis for the planning of CSP plants (also described by
Carling and Mar [37]) since molten salt treatment was considered
inevitable.

PNowadays a binary mixture of NaNO3 (cid:1) KNO3 (60(cid:1)40 wt%),
known as Solar Salt, is the standard storage medium and serves as
reference material in many publications regarding storage or heat
transfer molten salts [38]. Its composition differs from the equimolar
eutectic composition to reduce capital costs, since NaNO3 is less
costly than KNO3 and NaNO3 has a higher heat capacity compared to
KNO3. The effectively increased melting temperature, or more pre-
cisely liquidus temperature (Tm D 240
C), of Solar Salt compared to
the eutectic mixture (Tm 1⁄4 220

C) is considered tolerable.

(cid:5)

(cid:5)

PThe first large-scale power plants using indirect storage based on
synthetic oil as HTF and Solar Salt as storage medium were the Anda-
sol 1, 2 and 3 plants (all around 50 MWel) which can be operated for
more than 7 h by thermal energy provided by the indirect storage
unit [39]. Operating temperatures of the 28D
X500 tons tons of molten
salt inventory (for each Andasol plant) are between 295 °C and
385 °C. At the time of writing this article, the largest parabolic
trough power plant using indirect molten salt storage is the afore-
mentioned Solana power plant in Arizona providing 6h of storage by
12 storage tanks comprising a total of 125 000 tons of molten salt.

PUsing direct molten salt storage and thereby increasing the maxi-
mum process temperature is one of the most promising options for
CSP plants today. Increasing the hot tank temperature and therefore
the specific storage capacity can significantly reduce tank volumes
and the total required storage inventory. The Solar Two project has
experimentally investigated the performance, stability and econom-
ics of a central receiver (35 MWth) concept using molten salt as HTF
and storage medium, connected to a 10 MWel Rankine cycle. The
integrated molten salt volume was 1400 tons (107 MWh, 3 h of
autonomous operation) and thermal losses to the environment were
in the range of 100 kW in the hot and 50 kW in the cold tank. Within
the project salt chemistry changes were observed which however
did not affect the performance of the system. Furthermore, no limi-
tations deriving from corrosion phenomena could be observed after
exposing construction materials to molten salt for up to 30D
X000 h
[13]. The first commercial power plant based on direct molten salt
storage was the Gemasolar plant operational since 2011 generating
19.9 MWel with a Solar Salt inventory of 7900 tons and a storage
duration of 15 h. It is one of the first CSP plants that allows for a con-
tinuous 24-h operation.

PExtensive effort has been put into the investigation of potential
molten salt candidates for parabolic trough systems and most of
them can be considered variations of Solar Salt [29,40(cid:1)42]. Those
include the addition and/or exchange of cations and anions resulting
in a vast number of potential salt systems and an even higher num-
ber of publications related to the identification of their thermo-
physical properties. Unfortunately, there is no consensus on a signif-
icant number of these properties, making simulations of TES systems
based on those parameters challenging and partly unreliable. The
authors, which are a consortium of experts in the field of sensible
heat storage, critically assessed and partially re-measured the most
significant thermo-physical properties of a variety of molten salts

PThis work summarizes molten salt properties relevant for direct
molten salt technologies namely, liquidus temperatures, high tem-
perature stability, density, specific heat capacity, viscosity and ther-
mal conductivity. Finally, a list of recommendations will be given
based on a critical literature survey and own measurements. The
most relevant salt systems have been considered ranging from
binary Solar Salt to ternary Ca,Na,K//NO3 (HitecXL) and Li,Na,K//
NO3, to ternary reciprocal Na,K//NO23 (Hitec) and quinary reciprocal
Ca,Li,Na,K//NO23 making this work a fundamental basis for model-
ing approaches not only, but particularly in the field of direct molten
salt storage technologies.

2. Material aspects

2.1. Definition of salt mixtures

PTable 1 lists selected mixtures defined for further experimental
examinations but it must be emphasized that many more salt mix-
tures can be found in literature. Solar Salt serves as a reference sys-
tem for comparison of results. The three selected ternary salt
mixtures have similar melting temperatures with values in the range
from 120 °C to 140 °C. Compared to the two ternary additive HitecXL
and LiNaK-Nitrate mixtures, the mixture Hitec contains two anions
and represents a ternary reciprocal mixture. The multicomponent
mixture CaLiNaK is a quinary reciprocal system with four cations
and two anions. CaLiNaK exhibits a very low liquidus temperature of
about 70 °C.

PEach institution obtained salts from an own supplier (e.g., fine
chemical suppliers or bulk suppliers). In order to compare results,
Table 2 lists maximum impurity levels in KNO3 and NaNO3 as an
example. Anticaking agents are excluded from the experiments.
The recommended value of the total salt purity is > 99.0% for all
partners.

2.2. Correlation of salt properties with molten salt technology

PThe techno-economic analysis requires a deep understanding of a
variety of salt properties, which are typically obtained experimen-
tally, theoretically or both. The most relevant material properties are

Plisted (see Table 3) which, in the eyes of this consortium, have to be
assessed for the techno-economic evaluation of TES materials. Mea-
suring these properties adequately however requires profound
knowledge of the measuring techniques themselves including evalu-
ation of systematic errors (which is not presented at length in this
work but can be found elsewhere, see ref. [43] or related publica-
tions). Hereafter, the material properties relevant for molten salts as
well as recommendations about the standard (analysis) methods
will be presented.

P2.2.1. Liquidus temperature

PThe liquidus temperature Tliquidus is defined as the temperature at
which all solid compartments are molten. This is especially impor-
tant to stress since some salts exhibit melting ranges rather than
sharp melting temperatures [36]. In numerous studies the liquidus
temperature of the salt (the temperature of complete melting) is
typically referred to as the minimum temperature limit Tmin (e.g.
240(cid:1)260 °C for Solar Salt) of the hypothetical TES system, which, to
our understanding, disregards technically relevant safety margins. In
fact, technology providers specify a higher minimum temperature.
For Solar Salt the difference between Tmin (cid:1) Tliquidus is typically set to
about 30 K for CSP applications. The definition of the minimum oper-
ating temperature Tmin in this report is therefore recommended and
defined as follows:

PAs mentioned, the safety margin is mainly applied to avoid freez-
ing of the molten salt and thus irreversible damaging of pipes,
valves, the tanks, or other components. A suitable low viscosity value
required for pumping may lead to other useful values of Tmin. Also a
changing salt composition, especially a changing nitrite/nitrate
ratios, over time may have an influence on Tmin.

POverall, it is crucial to distinguish between the different types of
“melting” described in the literature. Traditionally (at least for mol-
ten salts), the melting point of a substance is measured in a Differen-
tial Scanning Calorimeter (DSC), [44] where melting is indicated by a
sharp peak (for pure substances) with a specific onset, peak maxi-
mum and endset. Hereby, the endset of the peak directly depends on
the boundary conditions of the measurement e.g. the sample mass
(or, generally, the thermal response of the sample) and the heating
rate (see e.g. ref. [45]). The true liquidus temperature is lower than
the measured liquidus temperature with a specific heating rate. Nev-
ertheless for comparison of liquidus temperatures the endset can be
used. For comparison, these boundary conditions should be kept
constant when comparing the liquidus temperature of different
salts. Additionally, the purity and composition of the sample affect
the melting behavior to the effect that a sharp melting peak in the
former case can transition into a melting range in the latter case. The
molten salts discussed in this work typically display melting ranges
where most importantly the “endset” of the melting peak, depicted
as liquidus temperature,
is determining the temperature below
which the substance is solidifying in whole or in part. Above the
liquidus temperature the salt or salt mixture is completely liquid.
The endset is investigated as a function of heating rate in heating
mode. The extrapolated value to the heating rate “0 K/min” gives the
true liquidus temperature in heating mode, while in cooling mode it
gives rise to eventually occurring subcooling phenomena. One has to
be aware, that measuring in cooling mode (rather than heating
mode) may disregard effects such as subcooling, thus leading to
incorrect values for Tliq.

P2.2.2. Thermal stability and maximum operating temperature

PThe maximum operating temperature is related to the thermal
decomposition of the salt mixture and one of the most controver-
sially described in literature. To comprehensively conceive the
working range of a molten salt, a maximum operating temperature
has to be defined. Analytical methods to examine the thermal stabil-
ity include evolved gas analysis, post- or in-situ analysis of salt com-
position [33,46] and weight
loss measurements [47,48]. First
approaches used thermogravimetric (TG) methods to set the maxi-
mum operating temperature. In order to compare TG-measurements
with heating ramps among different salt mixtures, an established
mass loss value is 3 wt% (hereafter only referred to as T3), excluding
volatile components such as water.

PThis value has been proposed by Raade and Padowitz [49] and
was used to benchmark mixtures of similar composition without
providing a deeper physical explanation. It is pointed out that the
corresponding temperature value at 3 wt% TG mass loss does not
give a long-term stability limit. This mass loss value allows for con-
venient TG measurement conditions and can be used for comparison
among authors. Moreover, these methods are found to be extremely
sensitive to the heating rate, sample mass, crucible types and other
effects may occur (creeping salt with changing surfaces areas).
Results are specifically sensitive to the heating rate. A typical value
may be 10 K/min There is a consensus that short scans, such as TG or
other methods, do not provide reliable information about the long-
term stability of the molten salt but serve as a first comparison
among different materials [50].

PScreening the available literature and results therein, we recom-
mend using isothermal stability tests, rather than TG measurements,
coupled with post-analytic methods that reveal the salt composition
temperature and/or atmosphere. The molten salt
over

time,

Pchemistry changes over time and requires monitoring over not only
hours or days, but weeks and months depending mainly on the tem-
perature level, the atmosphere during storage, the volume-to-sur-
face ratio, and the examined phenomena. Viable approaches aim at
storing molten salts isothermally under defined atmospheres and
continuous stirring in the kg- or sub-kg-scale [51]. Subsequent sam-
ple extraction and salt analysis consequently allows for a composi-
tional and thermal analysis of the extracted samples. Both gives an
insight into the salt chemistry as a function of time, atmosphere and
temperature, providing a more representative view on the decompo-
sition processes under operating conditions, compared to TG analy-
sis. Moreover, systematic studies on the decomposition mechanisms
are imaginable, which will be addressed in more depth in an upcom-
ing chapter.

P2.2.3. Specific heat

PIn all relevant publications regarding TES materials the specific
heat capacity cp of the heat storage and heat transfer media is a cru-
cial parameter. There is a direct correlation of stored heat Q with the
temperature interval DT, heat capacity cp and salt mass m as shown
in Eq. (1) earlier. The cp value is also crucial to obtain a heat balance
of thermal systems using heat transfer fluid measurements (e.g.
commissioning of CSP plants). The heat capacity is typically mea-
sured in a DSC [44]. Some older values were obtained by drop
calorimeters.

PRound robin tests on sensible heat storage materials typically
show large deviations among different measuring systems and a sys-
tematic error of § 3(cid:1)5% for individual measurements are to be
expected [52]. Different standard methods are available (ASTM and
DIN) and should be applied to reduce the systematic errors to a mini-
mum. The standard methods for measuring cp are summarized in the
X007 [53] and the American ASTM E1269-11 [54].
German DIN 51D
Both methods involve three measuring steps. At first, an empty cru-
cible is measured. The second step involves measuring the heat
capacity of a known substance, typically sapphire (also melting
standards can be used here), in the same crucible. In the last step the
molten salt sample is measured in the same crucible (without sap-
phire).

PTypical errors of cp values are expected in the range of § 3(cid:1)5%
for well performed and calibrated systems. However, in some round
robin tests cp values for identical materials varied among 10(cid:1)25%
revealing that this technique is sensitive to a variety of parameters
such as: crucible (material, geometry, position in the DSC), atmo-
spheric conditions (flow rates, gas type), sample geometry (creeping
of the molten salt must be avoided), baseline stability, impurities
and heat transfer within the sample, the type of reference and mea-
suring system as well as individual handling care by the user
[52]. Measurements may show decreasing heat capacity values
with temperatures, but there is no physical explanation for this
phenomena. Hence, decreasing heat capacity values with increas-
ing temperatures should be handled with care since they are
most likely a result of ongoing compositional changes in the salt
(ongoing evaporation of water/moisture, degradation of an anion,
etc.).

POlder measurements using a drop calorimeter lead to higher cp
values compared to DSC measurements. Hence, it is likely that there
is a systematic error between DSC and drop calorimeter measure-
ments. In order to obtain reliable cp values of salt mixtures, further
round robin tests with DSC and drop calorimeters are recom-
mended.

P2.2.4. Density

PIt is widely accepted that the density of salt mixtures is linearly
related to the temperature and experimental values support this
statement [55]. Density values are important to calculate the mass
flow from the volume flow measurement for molten salt pipes, but

Palso to calculate the volumetric storage capacity. Archimedean type
setups can reliably be employed for density measurements over a
wide temperature range. Bradshaw [46,56] published data based on
Archimedean methods involving buoyancy of immersed bodies,
where a Ti-steel body was chosen as sinker, attached to a balance.
Despite the fact that no commercial measuring systems seem to
exist for this high temperature application, the same physical
method as compared to room-temperature measurements is
applied. Uncertainties of density values are typically lower (in the
range of § 0.1%) compared to other thermal properties (e.g., heat
capacity or thermal conductivity) [38].

P2.2.5. Viscosity

PIn the field of heat transfer fluids the viscosity of the used liquids
is typically measured by a rheometer. Molten nitrate salts can be
considered Newtonian fluids and exhibit very low viscosities in the
range of water at room temperature, or even lower [57,58]. Most
effort is put into understanding the viscosity near the crystallization
point which is mostly motivated by safety risk assessment (pipe deg-
radation by abrasion with salt crystallites) [59]. At higher tempera-
tures the viscosity of the liquids is changing only marginally and
does not vary with composition to a large extent. Overall, the very
low viscosity requires sensitive techniques and within the literature
large errors can be found.

PTechnical drawbacks from increasing viscosities very close to the
freezing point will not play a significant role since minimum opera-
tion temperatures are typically 30 K from the crystallization temper-
ature of the molten salt. Despite, measuring the viscosity is
technically challenging, since e.g. creeping of the molten salt can
lead to misinterpretation of results. Overall, an error of § 1% (or
§ 0.25% when measured with great care) can be expected for a capil-
lary-type viscometer [60]. Besides capillary-type viscometers also
rheometers and torsional pendulum techniques have proven suit-
able in the past [59,60].

P2.2.6. Thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity

PThe thermal conductivity is an important value for heat trans-
fer design (e.g. heat exchanger, steam generator, solar receiver)
and for molten nitrate salts is rather low over the operating
temperature range. Molten salts exhibit thermally insulating
properties with similar values among each other of roughly
0.5 W/(m K) [61,62]. Accurate measurements require a profound
knowledge of the sample thickness at any stage during the mea-
surement which can be interfered by creeping or inhomoge-
neous heating of the salt sample, which will be addressed in the
next paragraph.

(cid:4)

(cid:3)
mm2=s

PMeasurements of thermal conductivity k and thermal diffusiv-
ity a are technically challenging and no established methods
exist for molten salt. One can calculate the thermal diffusivity
(cid:1)
a 1⁄4 k r ¢ cp
from the thermal conductivity k, if the volu-
metric heat capacity r ¢ cp is known (or vice versa). There are sev-
eral standard methods to determine the thermal conductivity and
thermal diffusivity of solids, e.g., laser flash analysis (LFA), heat
flow meter (HFM), guarded hot plate (GHP) and transient hot
bridge (THB). Also standards are commonly available (DIN, ASTM,
ISO). However, for molten salts these methods cannot be readily
employed since they are electrically conductive and corrosive
liquids at high temperatures with radiation and convection
aspects. Nagasaka gives an overview of different salt conductivity
measurement methods on NaNO3 [63]. He reviews that steady-
state methods contain “significant systematic errors due to radia-
tion and convection” compared to transient measurements.
Accordingly, typical differences among measurement values of
several § 10% can occur during the measurement of thermal con-
ductivity in the liquid state [63]. This error adds to the difficulty of
controlling the sample thickness, which is linearly related to k

Q is the heat flux, d is the sample thickness, dT is the tempera-

experimental difficulties make thermal conductivity and diffusivity
some of the most difficult properties to measure leading to a limited
number of publications for molten nitrate salts [63(cid:1)66]. Future
ambitions should aim at identifying engineering solutions towards
sample handling and preparation.

2.3. Decomposition mechanism of nitrate salts

PFundamental studies on the decomposition mechanisms of
nitrate salt date back to the 1960’s. It has been validated that the
decomposition of nitrate salts results in the formation of nitrite
according to reaction (4):

PNissen and Meeker were one of the first researchers to study the
thermodynamics and kinetics of this intrinsic reaction in an equimo-
lar mixture of NaNO3 and KNO3, establishing an equilibrium con-
stant K as a function of the oxygen partial pressure (pO2 ), [67] given

PTheir data recorded at different temperatures and defined pO2
yields a plot of the logarithmic nitrate/nitrite-ratio vs. logarithmic
oxygen partial pressure as shown in Fig. 4. From the linear depen-
dency the authors state that reaction (4) must be the dominating
one in the temperature range of 500(cid:1)620 °C. They further express
that the oxidation reaction is first-order with respect to both
nitrite and oxygen in this matrix and has an activation energy of
110 kJ/mol. Reaction (4) presents no concerns, considering that no
drawbacks originate from nitrites formation, the only practical
effect being a decrease in the melting point of the mixture and
oxygen release from the storage system.

PIn real systems many other reaction paths were proposed, mainly
ascribed to the decomposition of the nitrite ion to gaseous NxOy-type

Pspecies and oxide species (comprising oxides, hyperoxides, perox-
ides) in the melt. Some proposed reaction paths for alkali metal and
alkaline earth metal (calcium) nitrate/nitrite mixtures are shown in

PThe upper temperature limit is mainly controlled by nitrogen
oxide release (e.g. reaction (6)), itself being a net reaction of the dis-
sociation of nitrite into various nitrous oxides, (see e.g. Stern’s work
[70] for more detail), because oxide species can aggravate corrosion
and besides, reaction with atmospheric CO2 would lead to the for-
mation of carbonates as shown in reaction (8).

PCarbonate formation was also reported for alkaline earth salt sys-
tems and its low solubility might present a technical drawback. As
mentioned before, the decomposition of nitrites typically goes along
with the formation of nitrous oxides. Stern proposed that above
380 °C NO, NO2, N2, and O2 are the most stable constituents [70].
Therefore, to our understanding, the stability of the salt will also
depend on whether or not the gas atmosphere is continuously
removed. In case of continuous removal, a steady dissociation of
nitrites according to Eq. (4), and finally the decomposition into ionic
oxide species according to Eq. (6)/(7) must be expected due to the
continuous removal of the product gas (molecular) oxygen, that
drives the reaction towards nitrite formation and finally the decom-
position into ionic oxide species (e.g. O2(cid:1)
) with nitrogen oxide
removal with the product gas. Realistically, it can be considered that
the least stable component determines the overall mixture’s thermal
stability.

PYuvaraj et al. [71] determined the thermal stability of different
single nitrate salts in air and hydrogen concluding, that the thermal
stability is “inversely correlated with the charge density [...] of the
metal cation” (while for transition metals electron-back-donation
involving the metal-d-orbitals may lead to other trends). Therefore,
it can be stated that mixtures containing only alkali metal cations
(Na, K, Li) may be more stable compared to mixtures containing less
stable alkaline earth metals (Ca). The underlying degradation mech-
anism is linked to the strength of the N (cid:1) O bond and the overall
bond-order of the nitrate anion [72,73]. It is that either cations with
a high charge density (ratio of charge to volume) polarize the elec-
tronic cloud of the nitrate ion, or even a step further: the nitrate
electron can be transferred to a transition metal cation by back-
donation into its d-orbital. Both effects lead to a formal reduction of
the bond order and thus a weakening of the N (cid:1) O bond.

3. Thermal properties of molten salts

3.1. Liquidus temperature

PThere is some discrepancy about the liquidus temperature Tliquidus
as shown in the phase diagram in Fig. 5. Tliquidus of Solar Salt is about
240(cid:1)260 °C depending on the literature and exact conditions. The
fact that some nitrite may form or may not form (depending on the
operation conditions) which alters the liquidus temperature may
explain different values. A typical minimum operating temperature
of Solar Salt is Tmin D 290 °C (e.g. Andasol plants). Fig. 6 shows the
phase diagram of the system Ca,K,Na//NO3 from ref. [75(cid:1)78].
Coastal Chem. Co. suggests a liquidus temperature of 130(cid:1)140 °C for
the eutectic Ca,Na,K//NO3 mixture [69]. Yara states a melting tem-
perature of 131 °C for HitecXL composition [79,80]. Since the mini-
mum operating temperature should be defined as the liquidus
temperature plus a safety measure of 30K (see Eq. (2)), we propose
using a minimum operating temperature of 170 °C for the HitecXL

report and from ref. [74], respectively). Color bar shows values in degree Celsius.

Pmixture. HitecXL offers a potential for the use as heat transfer fluid
due to drastically reduced risk of salt freezing.

PThe minimum melting temperature, or liquidus temperature, of
the LiNaK system is around 120 °C for the eutectic mixture displayed
in Fig. 6 and thus is even lower than that of HitecXL. Coscia gives an
overview of differences in the eutectic composition and eutectic
melting temperature values [81]. The minimum operating tempera-
ture Tmin should be 150 °C according to the definition presented
earlier.

PVariations of the anion composition in solar salt have lead to the
formulation of other heat transfer fluids decades ago. Kirst et al.
have investigated a large variety of Na,K//NO23 mixtures and found
that the eutectic mixture, designated as Hitec, exhibits a liquidus
temperature (defined as freezing temperature in the respective
work) of 142 °C [35]. In this work, the phase diagram of the NaK//
NO23 was partly remeasured and the data is presented in Fig. 5.
Those mixtures with melting temperatures (Tliquidus) below 150 °C
are found in a concentration range of ca. 40(cid:1)55 molD

PDue to its complexity, no phase diagram exists for the quinary
reciprocal system CaLiNaK. A novel approach conducted by Bauer
et al. [84] however demonstrated, that eutectic mixtures of complex
systems can nonetheless be extracted by a simple technical
approach. This approach utilizes the fact that liquid phases form at
the interface of two or more mixed solids upon heating, which can
be extracted by vacuum techniques (the approach is described at
length in ref [84].). The sample extracted by this approach from a

3.2. Thermal stability

PThe decomposition of Solar Salt has been examined and reported
[13,33,85,86]. There is some discrepancy on the thermal stability of
Solar Salt. Some reports give a stability of up to 600 °C in air [78],
while others give a thermal stability up to only 550 °C. On a technical
scale the operation of Solar Salt-based TES systems at 565 °C and
566 °C max. temperature has been demonstrated successfully in the
Solar Two project [13] and the Crescent Dunes Solar Reserve project,
respectively. Generally, the stability will be highly depending on the
conditions applied, starting from the type of container material
used, atmospheric conditions (e.g. gas type, purity, exchange rate),
overheating phenomena, etc. Nitrite formation will occur in all cases

Pwhen Solar Salt is stored above 400 °C and at the same time carbo-
nates may form when the molten salt is heated in open containers.
Oxide formation in the melt may also occur according to the reaction
paths described earlier.

(cid:5)

PAt the time of writing, for commercial molten salt CSP plants, a
maximum operating temperature Tmax D 560
C is typically accepted.
At this temperature a certain nitrite/nitrate ratio will equilibrate
which is typically between 2(cid:1)5/95(cid:1)98 molD
X% depending on the
setup, sweep rates and salt volume. A recent publication by the
authors showed a constant nitrite content of 5 mol % over time for
Solar Salt stored at 560 °C in an open atmosphere [51]. However, the
nitrate content steadily decreased due to the formation of carbo-
nates according to Eq. (8). Bauer et al. [33] isothermally stored Solar
Salt at 550 °C in synthetic air at a sweep rate of 100 ml min(cid:1)1. The
nitrite content was 4.5mol % after equilibration and remained con-
stant over time. At lower temperatures, the nitrite content was suc-
cessively lower (1.8 mol % at 500 °C, 0.6 mol % at 450 °C). Bradshaw
et al. [46] presented similar values for the equilibrium nitrate con-
tent, namely 1.1 mol % at 500 °C and 5.7 mol % at 600 °C. Other
research groups intend to increase the maximum temperature limit
of Solar Salt up to 650 °C [87].

PThe thermal stability of Solar Salt typically sets the benchmark in
publications related to thermal stability of molten nitrate salts. Here
it must be emphasized, that the molten salts analyzed are typically
of very high purity. It is well described that some impurities may
affect the thermal stability, e.g. traces of Mg drastically increase NOx-
emissions on a technical scale as reported in the Solar Two project
[13]. The same can be expected for other metal traces, which have a
higher charge density than sodium or potassium [70]. E.g. Bradshaw
and Meeker [88] stated that “stability increases [as the charge density
decreases; AUTHOR’S NOTE], which implies that electrostatic effects between
the cations and the polyatomic nitrate anions are important”. Other
common impurities that affect the molten salt chemistry are CO2 and
water vapor which can react with oxide species in the melt and thus
may promote decomposition. This may eventually lead to the forma-
tion of insoluble decomposition products (e.g. carbonates) and aggra-
vate corrosion due to the formation of oxide species. On the
contrary, smaller changes in the physical properties of the molten

Psalt may occur (e.g. due to nitrite formation). Up to now, these
aspects are not addressed in detail in literature.

PThe thermal stability of HitecXL was experimentally investigated
at ENEA laboratories and the binary Solar Salt mixture was used as a
reference fluid. Post-analysis of the salts in terms of oxide contents
show a significantly increasing content of oxide while no increase in
Solar Salt is detectable up to 450 °C (data not shown).

PFurther reports on the thermal stability of HitecXL date back to
the early 1990’s. Bradshaw describes that calcium nitrate addition
reduces the thermal stability to a maximum operating temperature
of 500 °C (Table 4) [88]. This also holds true for ternary Ca,Na,K//NO3
mixtures with slightly different composition e.g. mixtures contain-
ing 20-30-50 wt% and 30-20-50 wt% CaðNO3Þ
(cid:1) NaNO3 (cid:1) KNO3
2
which are thermally stable in air up to 505 °C and 480 °C, respec-
tively [46]. Similar values for the HitecXL composition have been
reported by Kearney et al. [89] Siegel had personal communication
with the company Coastal Chemical Co., providing the Ca ternary
mixture, which stated a maximum operation temperature of 550 °C
[80]. Overall it can be said that there is some agreement that the
maximum operating temperature Tmax of HitecXL is lower compared
to that of Solar Salt. We propose an average value of 500 °C. How-
ever, further investigations are required to fully reveal the upper
temperature limit of HitecXL.

PThe large discrepancy between the stability limits presented is
mostly for two reasons: either different experimental approaches
were utilized, (and/) or that different parameters were used for com-
parison. For example in the work by ENEA the level of ionic oxide
species, which are readily formed already below 500 °C, was moni-
tored, while Gomez et al. [78] use the mass loss of a relatively small
amount of molten salt as performance indicator. These substantially
different methods lead to the wide spread of thermal stability values
presented not only for the HitecXL mixture. It must be stressed here
that thermal stability is a value based on technical criteria such as
the formation of insoluble species or the formation of corrosive spe-
cies: the acceptable level of decomposition may vary depending on
the intended application type and lifetime.

PRegarding the origin of the lower thermal stability limit there is a
consensus that the stability of HitecXL is limited by Ca(NO3)2 itself

Pwhich, amongst other proposed reactions, forms carbonates with
CO2 at low temperatures and reduces the thermal stability of the
nitrate ion by its higher ionic charge density compared to sodium
and potassium, as described earlier. Variations of the HitecXL com-
position, in the eyes of the consortium, are not promising since they
will not extend the high temperature stability while at the same
time exhibiting presumably higher melting temperatures - thereby
effectively reducing the operable temperature spread.

PAccording to ref. [80] the upper temperature limit (defined as the
temperature just below detectable oxides and nitrogen formation in
this work) of the LiNaK-nitrate mixture is similar to that of Solar
Salt, that is, about 600 °C. Other reports (ref. [88,93]) suggest that
the thermal stability is significantly lower (550 °C), and may be fur-
ther reduced by the presence of atmospheric CO2 [42,88]. Olivares
and Edwards [93] relativate the values of 550 °C for the thermal sta-
bility of LiNaK by comparing dynamic and static TG-MS measure-
ments. They demonstrate that firstly, the atmosphere plays a
significant role in the decomposition during dynamic TG-MS meas-
urements and secondly, dynamic measurements underestimate the
kinetics of the decomposition reactions under isothermal conditions.
Finally, the authors suggest a maximum temperature of 500 °C while
it would be “unlikely that this system could be used at a temperature of
600 °C for an extended period given that the relative concentration of
constituents would have changed having an impact on the constitution
of the eutectic” [93]. The latter will be responsible for a significant
change of the thermal properties by precipitation reactions. Appar-
ently, one of the major drawbacks of Li-containing mixtures is the
overall
increased oxide formation which aggravates corrosion
[34,88,93,95]. The oxide concentration is found to generally increase
with increasing Li concentration up to 40 mol% Li
[88]. It has to be
investigated in more depth, if the postulated extended working tem-
perature range outweighs the drawbacks of enhanced corrosion by
increased oxide levels in the long term. Overall for the LiNaK-nitrate
mixture a value of 550 °C is recommended. Similar to the HitecXL-
case further experiments for long-term stability of this mixture are
required.

mal stability up to 454 °C in air and 538 °C under nitrogen is reported

Pbut no experimental methods are demonstrated [69]. The highest
confirmed and experimentally validated stability of 530 °C was pre-
sented under an inert gas atmosphere by Federsel et al. [86]. In
industrial processes, a high temperature stability up to 454 °C has
been proven over many years of operation (see Bohlmann [96] and
literature cited therein). The mechanism of thermal degradation
involves the decomposition of sodium nitrite into sodium oxide,
sodium nitrate and nitrogen, according to:
5NaNO2Ð3NaNO3 þ Na2O þ N2

ð9Þ
PSilverman and Engel [97] reported that oxygen containing
atmospheres will inevitably result in the conversion of nitrite to
nitrate above 400 °C thereby increasing the melting point of the
Hitec mixture and eventually reducing its applicable temperature
range (assuming the maximum temperature limit
remains
unchanged). Despite, Bohlmann [96] describes that 0.5% of
NaNO2 will decompose per day (above 400 °C) even under a
nitrogen atmosphere according to Eq. (9) but no counter-meas-
ures are described.

PSome industrial sites applied counter-measures to prevent
molten salt degradation by additivation with small amounts of
Na2CrO4 (highly toxic), although this method was highly contro-
versial within the community (see discussion in ref. [96]). None-
theless, rates of nitrite content reduction are presented in this
work for the Hitec mixture operated at 425 °C and 525 °C,
respectively (data taken from a non-published paper at the Royal
Netherlands Institution of Engineers on operating experience
with HTS by W.H. v.d. Broek). The rate of decomposition is sig-
nificantly enhanced from 3.43 mol % a(cid:1)1 at 425 °C to 24.7 mol %
a(cid:1)1 at 525 °C which the author attributes not only to the higher
temperature but also the choice of container materials. E.g. at 425 °
C and a 525 °C a stainless steel and a carbon steel container were
used, the latter being suspected of catalyzing the nitrite decompo-
sition to a great extent. Generally, the required use of inert gas
atmospheres may generate a need for gas-tight storage tanks -
increasing the investment costs of the TES unit as well as the O&M
costs due to the requirement for continuous N2-gas flows.

PThe thermal stability of CaLiNaK determined by TG analysis and
isothermal tests is presented in Table 4. TG measurements which
provide semi-quantitative data on the thermal stabilities rather than
precise data on the decomposition process indicate a thermal stabil-
ity of up to 510 °C in N2 atmosphere. For more representative data,
the isothermal stability of the CaLiNaK mixture was investigated in
an autoclave test rig (setup described elsewhere [51] in more detail).
The device allows for isothermal testing of 100(cid:1)200g of salt under
continuous stirring and defined temperature and gas atmospheres.
Samples were extracted after defined time intervals and analyzed in
terms of nitrite content by photometry or ion chromatography. The
results clearly indicate that the nitrite content of the salt decreases
substantially when it is stored under synthetic air atmosphere at
400 °C. Experimental investigations by ENEA suggest an even lower
temperature for these reoxidation reactions. We assume that the
nitrite reacts with atmospheric oxygen to form nitrate according to
Eq. (3). However, a partial (irreversible) dissociation according to
Eqs. (4) and (5) cannot be excluded from the measurement techni-
ques employed. Both reactions will ultimately result in a dramatic
change of the thermal properties, especially the melting point of the
sample. From the known phase diagrams (e.g. Fig. 5) it can be
expected that the liquidus temperature will increase with a decreas-
ing nitrite concentration. Isothermal storage for 250 h under a flow
of nitrogen shows a more stable nitrite/nitrate ratio. Still, the nitrite-
nitrate ratio after 500 h at 400 °C is different to that of the beginning
of the experiment, even at such a low temperature. Reasons for the
ongoing decomposition remain unclear and require further investi-
gations. It is most likely that decomposition of the molten salt pro-
ceeds via reaction Eq. (7).

PSimilar mixtures based on either nitrates (quaternary Ca,Li, Na,
K//NO3) or nitrates/nitrites have been discussed in the literature but
only few have been fully characterized. Bradshaw et al. [46] pre-
sented data for three quaternary molten salts without specifying the
composition. Based on equilibrium nitrite contents measured at dif-
ferent temperatures he proposed an upper temperature limit of
» 520 °C for all mixtures. A ternary reciprocal mixture has been sug-
gested by Cordaro et al. [98] consisting of Li,Na,K//NO23 (33-19-
48 molD
X% per cation) and a nitrate/nitrite ratio of 0.56, exhibiting a
liquidus temperature of » 70 °C. Isothermal stability tests were per-
formed on a mixture with similar composition (Li-Na-K 20-27-
53 molD
D 1 : 1) and demonstrated that precipitation
occurred under an open atmosphere despite initial homogeneity,
accompanied by a significantly increasing nitrate:nitrite ratio up to
20:1 after 120 days. Despite the fact that the mixture cannot be con-
sidered stable under the conditions presented, we principally agree
with the statement of the authors that oxidation of the nitrite anion
can be prevented by employing an inert gas atmosphere.

PThe studies presented highlight that effort has to be taken to
understand not only the impact of atmospheres on the chemical sta-
bility of the different molten salts but that the community must
endeavor to understand the individual impact of the cations in the
individual salt mixtures. Their vast potential for low-temperature
applications may be feasible if their salt chemistry is understood to a
greater extent.

3.3. Specific heat

PSince Solar Salt is one of the most widely applied salt systems,
quite some literature data is available on its specific heat over a
wide temperature range. Fig. 8 shows some accepted literature val-
ues which all are comparable within the error of measurement (typi-
cally § 5%, error bars in the graph are § 7%). The data of Zavoico
[99], which describes the cp of Solar Salt as linearly dependent of
temperature, is also used as reference in the Standard Advisor Model
[100]. A typical cp value of molten Solar Salt is in the range of 1.54 J/
(g ¢ K) § 0.077 J/(g ¢ K) when comparing relevant literature, as pub-
lished by Bauer [33].

1⁄2

PWith respect to the binary mixture, HitecXL presents a lower sol-
idus point, of about 130 °C and a decrease of the latent (melting)
X.046 J/g [90]. Specific heat is practically the same
enthalpy, from 12D
(considering an experimental error of 7%) with respect to Solar Salt
(Fig. 8 (b)). A fit through the cp values measured in this report (by
ENEA) over temperature gives a linear regression function of

ture constant value of 1.43 J/(g ¢ K) was measured in a temperature
range 130(cid:1)220 °C using a Netzsch DSC 204. IK4-TEKNIKER measured
a similar constant cp value: 1.48 J/(g ¢ K) in the range 150(cid:1)320 °C
using the equipment HPDSC 132 from Mettler Toledo. Siegel et al.
[34] reprinted values from Coastal Chemical Company: 1.5 J/(g ¢ K) at
120 °C to 1.37 J/(g ¢ K) at 520 °C with a linearly decreasing trend.
Kelly gives a value of 1.395 J/(g ¢ K) at 450 °C [39]. All results indicate
that the heat capacity of HitecXL in fact is similar to that of Solar Salt
which is why we recommend using a value of 1.4 J/(g ¢ K) in the tem-
perature range of 150(cid:1)450 °C. The effect of slightly decreasing val-
ues over temperature however, defies quantum mechanics and
there is no experimental validation as to why this is observed. It is
possible that sample decomposition or incomplete dehydration at
the start of the experiments contribute to the observed phenome-
further investigations are required to validate this
non, but
hypothesis.

PAlso for the eutectic LiNaK mixture the heat capacity is practi-
cally the same as for Solar Salt (within the expected experimental
error of 5 to 10%), and can be considered constant in the operating
temperature range with a value of 1.6 J/(g ¢ K) (This report). Coscia
et al. propose that lithium addition increases the specific heat

Pmarginally [81]. For the considered composition an almost constant
value of 1.59 J/(g ¢ K) in a range from 150 to 400 °C is reported. At
DLR the heat capacity was found to be almost independent of
temperature between 130 and 220 °C, with a value of 1.65 J/
(g ¢ K). IK4-TEKNIKER measured the following cp values: 1.694 J/
(g ¢ K) at 138 °C to 1.751 J/(g ¢ K) at 320 °C with linearly increasing
values. For simplicity a constant value of 1.6 J/(g ¢ K) is proposed,
which is marginally higher than that of Solar Salt and thus often
put forward as an argument of using Li-ternary molten salts as
HTF or storage media.

PThe heat capacity of the Hitec mixture, in liquid state, is practi-
cally constant and equal to about 1.55 J/(g ¢ K) [69]. A similar value of
1.56 J/(g ¢ K) is reported by Silverman and Engel (ref. [97]) and by
Janz (ref. [101]) with a value of 1.55 J/(g ¢ K) in a range from 170 °C to
510 °C. In all cases the heat capacity is constant over temperature.
IK4-TEKNIKER measured the following cp values: 1.506 J/(g ¢ K) at
160 °C to 1.463 J/(g ¢ K) at 320 °C with linearly decreasing values. We
suggest using data provided by Janz with a value of 1.55 J/(g ¢ K)
between the melting point and the maximum operating tempera-
ture of 500 °C [101].

PDLR found an average cp value of 1.65 J/(g ¢ K) for CaLiNaK
between 100 °C and 300 °C. IK4-TEKNIKER also measured an average
heat capacity value of 1.65 J/(g ¢ K) with a DSC which we recommend
using as temperature independent between the melting point and
400 °C. This trend agrees well with the observations made, namely
that the addition of lithium typically enhances the heat capacity.

PNowadays, efforts are made to enhance the specific heat capacity
of molten salts by adding nanoparticles to the melt. This approach
leads to the formation of so called nanofluids which supposedly
exhibit significantly enhanced cp values in comparison with the
“undoped” molten salt. [102(cid:1)105] A difficulty often arising in publi-
cations is that the thermal and/or chemical stability of these nano-
fluids
important degradation
mechanism are related to either chemical reactions between the
nitrate melt and the nanoparticles or simply segregation of nanopar-
ticles over time - both leading to significantly decreasing thermal
performances. Surfactants are supposed to overcome this problem
but no long-term stability tests demonstrating a stable thermal per-
formance over months of use, have been presented to our best
knowledge.

3.4. Viscosity

PThe earliest reports on the viscosity of Solar Salt date back to
1969 when Murgulescu and Zuca published viscosity data of dif-
ferent molten salt mixtures [57]. For the binary alkali-nitrate
systems they found a dependence of viscosity (h) on the differ-
ences in cationic radius between the participating ions. As a
short summary, they ascribe the found trends to repulsive inter-
actions between the cations resulting in greater degrees of free-
dom as compared to the pure salts (the effect is more marked
with increasing differences in ionic radii). Consequently, the vis-
cosity of mixtures is lower as compared to that of pure salts. The
viscosity data of Solar Salt from Murgulescu and from Pacheco is
plotted in Fig. 9 [57,106]. The data agrees well with one another
and is used as reference data, e.g. in the System Advisory Model
(SAM) [100]. Pacheco et al. (ref. [106]) fit the data as third order
polynomic function as:

PNascimento and Aparicio [107] et al. describe the viscosity of
liquids over temperature using the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann-Hesse
(VFTH) equation [108,109], which originally was used for the
description of glassy or supercooled liquids. To the best knowledge
of the authors however, there is not physical relation to the molecu-
lar structure of the liquid and other optimized fit equations can be
equally good in fitting viscosity data of molten salts. The viscosity
was typically fitted using a m D A ¢ Tð(cid:5)
CÞB - type fit function. Viscosity
of HitecXL was compared with the one of the Solar Salt [90]. It is
noteworthy that the Ca ternary mixture presents a higher viscosity,
and that this value is particularly high near the HitecXL freezing
point. Evidently, also comparing with the features of other mixtures,
the presence of calcium is the cause of this behavior. The values pro-
vided by Coastal Chem. Co., to our knowledge, underestimate the
viscosity near the freezing point and are more reliable above 200 °C.
Data extracted from Gomez et al. shows similar trends above 200 °C
and this work adds viscosity data near the freezing point [78]. The
viscosity of a 44-12-44 wt% mixture of Ca-Na-K has been plotted in
Fig. 9. The values show a somewhat lower viscosity at tempera-
tures exceeding 450 °C (x < 2.2), compared to the coastal

PViscosity results of LiNaK are very similar to Solar Salt for the
temperatures where the two mixtures are both in liquid state (about
1.5 mPa ¢ s around 500(cid:1)550 °C for both mixtures) [31]. Near the
freezing point (120 °C) the LiNaK ternary viscosity is not particularly
high, presenting a maximum value of about 30 mPa ¢ s (compared
with the more than 200 mPa ¢ s of Hitec XL near 140 °C). Coscia also
discusses viscosity values of LiNaK-Nitrate and concludes that
changes in the composition have only minor impact on the viscosity,
which can decrease down to 1 mPa ¢ s (similar to water at room tem-
perature) [81]. We recommend using an extrapolated fit through the
viscosity data of Solar Salt and LiNaK (ref. [106], and [59] respec-
tively) to extend the data presented by Bradshaw to the entire tem-
perature range:

PThe viscosity of Hitec is reported to range from about 11 mPa ¢ s
near the freezing at 200 °C and 1.6 mPa ¢ s at 500 °C [69,80], as shown
in Fig. 9. More correlations have been made in the last decade(s).
Some authors suggest that the viscosity follows an exponential, or a
second order polynomic function [35,58]. Serrano-Lopez et al. [110]
propose using an average viscosity with 3.69% standard deviation
similar to that of Coastal Chemical Co (which has been refitted by
Siegel et al. [34]) according to:

PFor the measurement of the viscosity of CaLiNaK a commercial
shear rheometer was utilized by DLR (Anton Paar MCR 501). This
device is equipped with a cylinder of a diameter and height of
24 mm and with a distance between inner and outer cylinder of 1
mm. The measurement was performed at a torque of 500 m Nm. The
viscosity of CaLiNaK was determined up to 200 °C with a heating
rate of 2 K min(cid:1)1. Data was extrapolated up to 400 °C using Solar
Salt data [106]. The following fit function for h (in mPa s) was deter-
mined by DLR:

PThere is a consensus that Ca-rich mixtures generally increase the
viscosity of a molten salt considerably. Technical drawbacks regard-
ing the pumpability of the fluid may arise from that fact. Gomez
et al. [78] describe that a Ca-Na-K mixture of 44-12-44 wt-%, respec-
tively, displayed viscosities high enough to make it not pumpable
immediately above its melting point, without specifying this

Ptemperature range. The trends and complications have also been
described briefly by Bradshaw [59] for ternary and quaternary mol-
ten salts based on Ca(NO3)2. A general recommendation as to when
a salt can be considered not pumpable, will not be presented here
since influencing parameters are far to complex to be described
within the scope of this paper. The authors rather recommend
related literature such as by Mcdowell and Schwartz [111] or Smith
[112, 113], who published reports on the design of pumps for molten
salt applications.

PThe density of Solar Salt has been found to decrease linearly with
increasing temperature, as shown in Fig. 10 [106,114]. Zavoico
describes a correlation of r
CÞ for Solar
Salt in the temperature range from 260 °C to 593 °C [99]. Kelly et al.
give a density of 1868 kg/m3 at 450 °C for the density of HitecXL
[39]. It can be expected that the density generally increases with
increasing calcium content due to its higher molar density (see ref.
[56,115] and literature cited therein). Data from Siegel et al.
(reprinted from the Coastal booklet) suggests a steeper density
increase over temperature than for the other molten salt systems
[34]. Extrapolating the density of calcium nitrate from literature
data (ref. [55]) as well yields a density for HitecXL that is higher than
for other molten salt systems (Fig. 10). In contrast to Siegel, the cal-
culated density increase over temperature is similar to that of Solar

tem Advisory Model, [100]) is in agreement with Bradshaw’ s data. It
expresses the density as r

extrapolation of literature data we suggest that the density of CaLi-
NaK at the eutectic point is around 1943 kg/m3 at 200 °C (using an
extrapolated density of calcium nitrate from the density of other
binary mixtures). In agreement with other data we suggest that the

3.6. Thermal conductivity

PZavoico provides data of the thermal conductivity (TC) of Solar
Salt which is plotted in Fig. 11 [99]. A summary of different literature
data on the TC of Solar Salt is also available showing values of around
0.5 W/(m ¢ K) with an estimated error of 15% [33] .Nagasaka and
Nagashima [63] summarized TC measurements on single NaNO3 and
KNO3 molten salts and found that despite the claimed maximum

Paccuracy of § 5% given by each author, actual values varied by up to
30%. This well resembles the difficulty of TC measurements resulting
in a wide range of values and a high sensitivity for uncertainties due
to the afore-mentioned difficulty of molten salt handling. As a con-
servative assumption, the following TC values for each molten salt
mixture have been plotted in Fig. 11 with a conservative value for
the uncertainty of 10%.

PReports on the thermal conductivity of HitecXL are rare. Siegel
and Kelly give a temperature constant value of 0.519 W/(m ¢ K)
obtained from personal communication with Coastal Chemical Co
[34,39]. We suggest using the data supplied by Coastal Chem Co.
which gives the thermal conductivity as a temperature independent
value of 0.52 W/(m ¢ K). Reported thermal conductivities of LiNaK
are similar to Solar Salt values, varying from 0.4 W/(m ¢ K) at
149 °C (300 °F) to about 0.3 W/(m ¢ K) at 454 °C (850 °F) (see
Coastal Chemical Co. data sheet). The only results obtained for
the thermal conductivity of Hitec to our knowledge are pre-
sented by Yang and Garimella and show steadily decreasing val-
ues over temperature (Fig. 11). Siegel [34] also refers to data
from Coastal Chemical Co. and Serrano-L(cid:1)opez [110] proposes a
constant value of 0.48 W/(m ¢ K). Together with the data obtained
for the similar quaternary LiNaKCa//NO3 quaternary from ref.
[91] no significant differences are expected in comparison with
the Solar Salt. It is reasonable to assume a value of 0.5 W/(m ¢ K).

PNo data of thermal conductivity of CaLiNaK is available yet. It is
however reasonable to assume, that the thermal conductivity is sim-
ilar to that of Solar Salt and HitecXL. Especially, since the error is
around 10%, using a temperature independent value of around
0.5 W/(m ¢ K), which is close the value for the corresponding all-
nitrate-mixture, is recommended [34].

PThe fact that thermal conductivity is one of the most difficult fea-
tures to measure accurately, makes the design of heat exchanging
units difficult and rather requires for the acquisition of data on a
technical scale. In the future, designing measurement cells for heat
conductivity measurements is strongly advised by the authors of
this paper. This may enhance the data quality in terms of accuracy
significantly and allow for a more precise simulation of heat flows in
a TES/CSP unit.

3.7. Impurities and corrosion in molten salts

PIt has been described by different authors that impurities and
handling of molten salts can drastically affect their thermal perfor-
mance and corrosiveness. Both effects can counteract which will be
described in a bit more detail hereafter. Nevertheless it has to be
emphasized that a full review on available corrosion studies is out of
the scope of this work. The intention of this section is to raise an
awareness for the impact of impurities on some aspects related to
corrosion, chemical stability and thermal stability.

PFor high purity molten nitrate salts degradation mechanism in
terms of nitrate-nitrite equilibrium, oxide- (e.g. O2(cid:1)
) and carbonate
formation are hardly described. It is reasonable to assume that espe-
cially the oxide-anion is an aggressive oxidizing agent towards metal
surfaces, as described by Baraka et al. [116] or M. De Jong and
H. J. Broers [117]. As a result when the molten salt is in contact with
metallic containment materials, oxidation of iron and chromium is
likely to occur. According to different authors [118(cid:1)120] a number
of oxygen species can be responsible for the oxidation process and
their formation namely, the oxide anion (O2(cid:1)
2 ) or
(cid:1)
superoxides (O
2 ), the latter two being formed by reactions with the
nitrate/nitrite species according to

PTheir existence has been validated by e.g. Desimoni et al. [118]
using electrochemical methods which had been used for the detec-
tion of water by the same authors earlier [121]. However, it should
be mentioned that there is very limited work on which exact type of
the oxide species exists at operating temperatures. Similar to oxy-
gen, water can contribute to corrosion significantly by the formation
of hydroxide species according to
(cid:1)

(cid:1)

PThis is especially relevant since the solubility of water is higher
than for other gases owing to a strong solvation effect as described
by Peleg [122]. Interestingly, introduced water can eventually lead
to nitrite consumption according to Zambonin et al. [123], see
Eq. (21), and even hinder peroxide and superoxide formation [124].

PSingh [125] investigated the impact of moisture on the corrosive-
ness (referred to as oxidation rate in his work) of NaNO3 and KNO3
towards pure iron. Although there is no practical relevance for pure
iron as containment material his findings demonstrate that moisture
principally enhances the corrosion (oxidation) rate. He describes
that in dry melts intrinsically formed oxides (without moisture) are
responsible for the oxidation of surface metals or metal oxides
resulting in the formation of (Na/K)FeO2 as an outer layer. In wet

Pmelts the moisture increases the solubility of oxides in the melt and
ultimately results in enhanced iron oxidation rates. It is important to
note that the solubility of water increases with increasing ionic
charge density of the cation in the order K < Na < Li [122]. In con-
trast, the solubility of oxides increases in the opposite order
Li < Na < K according to Bartlett and Johnson [126]. For example, for
KNO3 this is due to the conversion of oxides (K2O) to highly soluble
superoxides (KO2).

PThe presence of oxides in molten nitrate salts is known to signifi-
cantly enhance the basicity of the melt [128] which drastically
affects the solubility of the metallic alloys in the molten salt (see e.g.
ref. [129]). The formation of Fe3O4-layers on mild steel surface at
temperatures between 250 °C and 450 °C in eutectic sodium-potas-
sium nitrate has been reported by Baraka et al. [116]. Similar obser-
vations were made by D€olling et al.
[130] who additionally
investigated the impact of chloride impurities on pitting corrosion at
250 °C. The authors found that a Cr-Ni-oxide layer formed at the sur-
face of austenitic steels preventing further corrosion.

PAt higher temperatures Bradshaw [131] found the formation of
spinell and magnetite structures on surfaces of Alloy 800 and SS316
in Solar Salt at 605 °C, while at higher temperatures the oxide layers
were more complex in terms of composition and morphology. Fur-
thermore, he observed the dissolution of chromium in the melt
which indicated changes in the corrosion mechanism with increas-
ing temperature. A recent publication by the authors of this article
confirmed that chromate formation is a major concern and drasti-
cally affected by the molten salt chemistry and impurity levels
[132].

PDorcheh et al. [133] support that statement and recently demon-
strated a drastic enhancement of corrosiveness of Solar Salt when
impurities of chlorides are present. More precisely, ferritic steels
showed non-protective character while austenitic SS316 formed a
protective Cr-rich oxide layer whose scale increased with increasing
chloride content. Overall, the chloride ion is a major concern in tech-
nical applications since severe corrosion can only be overcome by
the use of expensive austenitic, Cr-Ni-rich steels.

PThe variety of corrosion studies regarding metals investigated,
molten salt qualities (in terms of impurities), storage conditions and
preparation methods is too diverse to allow for a direct quantitative
comparison between them. A respectable summary on the principal
stability of some metal alloys has been presented in the 1980’s by
Slusser et al. [134] and the statements still hold true today: “Nickel
alloys with 15(cid:1)20% chromium contents performed the best, while iron
alloys, with low or no nickel exhibited poor corrosion resistance at high
temperatures”. Type and concentration of impurities and storage
conditions drastically affect the corrosion process and therefore
must be taken into close consideration during future investigations.

4. Recommendations

PThis work describes characterization methods of state-of-the-art
and novel molten salt mixtures. Since molten salts are utilized for
sensible heat storage and as heat transfer fluids, this work is an
essential contribution to the assessment and development of
advanced CSP concepts. The review focused on the liquidus temper-
ature, the thermal stability and thermal properties namely heat
capacity, viscosity, density and thermal conductivity. As an overall
goal this work identified and assessed salt mixtures that have been
proposed as lower-temperature heat transfer fluids. The work
focuses, but is not limited to LF (parabolic trough or linear Fresnel)
CSP plants with molten salt as heat transfer fluid in the solar field.
Salt mixtures with a lower melting temperature (Hitec, HitecXL and
LiNaK-Nitrate, CaLiNaK) are candidates for LF CSP plants with molten
salt as heat transfer fluid. Potential advantages include lower solar
field temperatures, improved night operation and drainage, larger
operation temperatures differences and a lower risk of freezing.

PWe demonstrated that by using new salt mixtures (CaLiNaK) the
liquidus temperature can be decreased down to 74 °C. It could be
shown that the CaLiNaK mixture has an increased heat capacity as
compared to classical Solar Salt. When considering the density,
which is directly correlated to the volumetric storage capacity, the
alternate mixtures are similar to the state-of-the-art mixture. Over-
all the temperature operation range of CaLiNaK (110 °C(cid:1)400 °C)
could be slightly higher DT D 290 K than Solar Salt (290 °C(cid:1)560 °C)
with a value of DT D 270 K.

PTernary mixtures of Na,K//NO3 with Ca (HitecXL) or Li (LiNaK-
Nitrate) show a decreasing melting point compared to binary mix-
tures, but it can be stated that both cations reduce the thermal sta-
bility. In case of calcium, carbonate formation is observed while Li-
addition seems to result in pronounced oxide formation during iso-
thermal storage in open atmospheres. While the first case will inevi-
tably lead to the formation of insoluble precipitates that may block
pipes and valves, oxide formation may enhance steel corrosion sig-
nificantly. The reciprocal ternary Na,K//NO2,NO3 systems with the
selected mixture Hitec has shown promising thermo-physical prop-
erties regarding melting point, heat capacity and viscosity, but its
use may be limited by the reactivity of the anion species. In air, no
storage above 400 °C seems possible due to a conversion of nitrite
into nitrate. Preventing this conversion requires an inert atmo-
sphere. Only then the salt can be used at temperatures above 400 °C.
The biggest advantage of Hitec, the profound knowledge of its stabil-
ity limits and chemistry, dates back to its extensive use as industrial
heat storage medium since the early 400s. Still, a use in direct molten
salt storage systems requires for the use of inert gas atmospheres
which supposedly increases the price of the TES unit.

PFinally, Table 5 summarizes the thermal properties of the salt
mixtures and is intended for use in modeling and thermal design of
molten salt systems.

5. Conclusions

PThis work critically reviewed and specified salt properties of the
following five salt mixtures: Solar Salt, HitecXL, LiNaK-Nitrate, Hitec
and CaLiNaK in terms of phase diagrams, composition, melting tem-
perature, minimum operation temperature, thermal stability, maxi-
mum operation temperature, density, heat capacity,
thermal
conductivity and viscosity. Large differences between literature
reports and in part systematic measurement errors exacerbate the
definition of some properties such as the thermal conductivity and

Prequire for more extensive analysis. Other properties such as the
thermal stability, density and heat capacity, despite large discrep-
ancy amongst different literature sources, can be assessed accurately
and reliably if appropriate measuring methods are identified. Overall
our study demonstrates that the versatility of salt compositions
results in a substantial matrix of achievable thermal properties. Ulti-
mately, this allows tuning salt properties towards a variety of indus-
trial presets and requirements demonstrating the versatility of
nitrate salt systems.

Marta Hernaiz graduated in Chemical Sciences from the
University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU. She started her
research activity at IK4-Tekniker, in the Surface Chemistry
unit in 2006, in the field of lubricants. Since then, she has
specialized in the industrial fluids sector, such as lubri-
cants, metal working fluids, refrigerants, heat transfer flu-
ids (HTF) for a wide range of temperatures and therefore
for diverse sectors, such as industrial heat recovery, con-
centrated solar power plants (CSP), HVAC systems. She par-
ticipates in R&D projects aimed at energy improvement of
the facility through the fluid that operates in it, using selec-
tive additivation strategies with ionic liquids (IL), Nanoma-
terials (NP) and phase change materials (PCM). Her activity
also is focused on defining maintenance and quality control strategies for conven-
tional fluids and new developments. He has also coordinated industrial and European
projects.

Thomas Bauer, received his PhD degree in the area of ther-
mal engineering from the Northumbria University in the
UK. Thomas Bauer works within DLR on material investiga-
tions and molten salt storage for thermal energy storage
since 2005. In 2012, he changed the DLR location from
Stuttgart to Cologne. Thomas Bauer is responsible for a
research group on molten salt storage located in Cologne
and Stuttgart. This research group addresses the develop-
ment of molten salt storage along the value chain. New
material concepts are being pursued in order to extend the
aforementioned temperature range while new molten salt
storage systems with lower capital costs and improved
operational behavior are under development. Further
attention is also paid to the integration of molten salt storage systems. The group
operates the Test Facility for Thermal Energy Storage in Molten Salts (TESIS) with
more than 100 tons of molten salt.

Alexander Bonk, was born in Erfurt (Germany) studied
chemical engineering at the University of Applied Sciences
e
M
Aijnster (Germany). He received a PhD from the Albert-
Ludwigs-University of Freiburg i.Br. (Germany) in 2016 for
his studies on high temperature ceramics for solar thermo-
chemical energy conversion. Since beginning of 2016 he is
a Research Fellow at the German Aerospace Center (DLR)
and leading activities related to materials science in Stutt-
gart with a particular focus on molten salts (MS) as heat
transfer and storage fluids in the department of Engineer-
ing Thermodynamics within the research group of Dr.
Thomas Bauer. His work focusses on the identification of
novel molten salt mixtures towards classical- and Gen3-
Solar Thermal Power Plants or other industrial processes utilizing waste heat. This
includes the investigation of the high temperature stability of MSs and the study of
decomposition mechanisms on relevant scales all of which giving an insight into the
expected long term performance. Additionally, high temperature corrosion and other
material interactions are part of current research activities. He is the main and co-
author of numerous publications related to the field of solar thermal and thermo-
chemical energy storage and conversion.

Giovanni Salvatore Sau, male, was born in Sassari (Italy).
He holds a degree in chemistry (1994). After having
worked mainly in the analytical chemistry field, since 2004
he works at the ENEA research centre of Casaccia (Rome,
Italy). He leads the laboratory of chemical and thermo-
(cid:4)
physical characterization of the ENEA ^a
AIJsolar thermal
technology division and his activities has been focused on
characterization of materials for heat transfer and storage
in CSP plants, solar fuels, water splitting thermochemical
processes and solar chemistry processes. He was and is
involved in several national and European programs, espe-
cially FP7 and H2020 projects (HyCycles, Sol2Hy2, MATS,
In
SFERAII, STAGE STE, ORC-PLUS, STS MED, RESLAG,
Power) dealing with carbon free hydrogen production, chemical-physical and com-
patibility characterizations on molten salt mixtures for CSP field and possible applica-
tions of molten salts mixtures as thermal fluids in new generation power plants. He is
the main and co-author of numerous peer reviewed publications on the aforemen-
tioned topics, and several patents regarding solar chemistry and applications of low
melting mixtures to CSP plants.

Nerea Uranga graduated in Chemical Sciences, she has
been working at IK4-TEKNIKER as a researcher for nine
years. Her main research activity is focused on the
improvement of heat storage media such as molten salts
(MS) and industrial fluids, mainly heat transfer fluids (HTF)
for a wide range of applications such as heat recovery, air
conditioning systems and solar thermoelectric field. His
know-how is concerned with experimentation in this field,
developing new analytical methods for precise characteri-
sation of these new and innovative materials. That’s why
he has a deep knowledge in: (i) Medium infrared (FTIR)
and visible ultraviolet (UV(cid:1)vis) spectroscopic infrared
(FTIR) techniques (ii) Thermal analysis; Thermogravimetric
(TGA), Calorimetric (DSC) iii) Chromatography (CG-MS, GC-FID), iv) Morphological
characterization (SEM, Surface, BET), V) Characterization of dispersions by granulo-
metric distribution (Dynamic Light Scattering and DLS, and laser diffraction) and Rhe-
ological properties of materials.
