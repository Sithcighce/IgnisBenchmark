Fuel cells are electrochemical devices that convert chemical energy directly into electrical energy with 
high eﬃciency. The high cost of platinum catalysts and sluggish reaction kinetics are the main challenges 
in the development of low-temperature fuel cells. Although signiﬁcant effort s have been made to pre- 
pare effective non-precious-metal-based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts, suitable anodic cata- 
lysts are still far from realization. The reported onset potential of a nonprecious anodic catalyst toward 
low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons, such as methanol, ethanol, and urea, in alkaline media is approxi- 
mately 0.35 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), which is far from the theoretical potentials of −0.61, −0.54, and −0.55 V (vs. 
Ag/AgCl), respectively. Therefore, some researchers concluded that nonprecious anodic catalysts are not 
practical, taking into account the ORR potential of 0.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in alkaline media. Recently, however, 
several reports demonstrated an open-circuit voltage (OCV) of more than 0.8 V using non-precious-metal- 
based anodic catalysts, which contradicts expectations. Therefore, to answer these conﬂicting claims, this 
review intensively discusses the possibility of using nonprecious metals, for example Ni-based catalysts, 
for actual electricity generation in direct (methanol, ethanol, and urea) fuel cells, and the different meth- 
ods applied to achieve the highest values of OCV. Also, the progress done in the preparation of non- 
precious anodic catalysts is reviewed. Finally, conclusions and recommendations to prepare durable and 
active fuel cells using non-precious-metal-based anodic catalysts are presented.

1. Introduction 

Nowadays, energy scarcity and environmental pollution are the 
main challenges affecting human society and hindering communi- 
ties’ development. Therefore, the exploration of clean energy re- 
sources and their related devices have attracted worldwide interest 
[1–4] . Recently, great attention has been paid to fuel cells (FCs) as 
a new technology for the direct conversion of the chemical energy 
stored in fuels into electricity with high eﬃciency and little to no 
environmental impact [5–7] . FCs have several advantages, includ- 
ing high theoretical eﬃciency, low emissions, and the ability to use 
biomass-derived fuels [8,9] . In particular, low-temperature FCs are 
considered as eﬃcient, environmentally friendly, and silent power 
sources that can be used for both low-power-consumption devices 
(i.e., portable devices) and medium-power ones (i.e., vehicles). 

Low-temperature FCs can be directly fed with low-molecular- 
weight hydrocarbons, such as methanol, ethanol, and urea, show- 
ing  a  high  open-circuit  voltage  (OCV)  similar  to  that  of  proton- 
exchange membrane FCs [10,11] . Methanol and ethanol, the sim- 
plest  alcohols,  which  are  easily  stored  and  transported  in  liquid 
form,  have  high  energy  densities  of  6.1  and  8.2 kW  h  kg −1 ,  re- 
spectively  [12] ,  and  can  be  produced  from  different  biomass  re- 
sources [13–18] . Moreover, urea is a nontoxic fuel with a high en- 
ergy density of 16.9 MJ/l [19,20] , which is industrially produced in 
large amounts as fertilizer and exists in industrial wastewater and 
natural urine [21–23] . 

Despite the promising features of low-temperature FCs that are 
directly fueled with methanol, ethanol, or urea, their commercial- 
ization is hindered by the high cost of the Pt and Pt-alloy catalysts 
that  are  used  at  both  the  anode  and  cathode  [24–26] .  Pt  is  not 
only expensive and limited in resources, but it is also easily poi- 
soned by carbon monoxide (CO) and other intermediates that are 
formed during oxidation of the different fuels [27–31] . A good cat- 
alyst should be cheap, abundant, and able to adsorb the reactants 
easily on its surface with a large number of active sites. In addi- 
tion, it should have high mechanical strength, long-term stability 
(i.e., anti-poisoning capability) along with excellent electron-, ion- 
, and mass-transfer capabilities. Therefore, a tremendous amount 
of  work  has  been  devoted  to  replacing  Pt  catalysts  with  non- 

precious-metal-based ones at both the anode and cathode of low- 
temperature FCs [32,33] . This extensive research succeeded in pro- 
ducing nonprecious cathodic catalysts that showed a high oxygen 
reduction reaction (ORR) activity, such as nitrogen-doped carbon 
materials [34–40] , metal carbides and nitrides [41–45] , and metal 
oxides [46–48] . Meanwhile, nonprecious anodic catalysts are still 
far from realization. To date, the best-reported catalyst for the ox- 
idation of low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons (methanol, ethanol, 
and urea) in alkaline media is Ni, which is used in the form of 
Ni oxide or hydroxides [49] . Nevertheless, the reported Ni oxide or 
hydroxide catalysts still exhibited a low electrical conductivity, a 
high onset potential, few active sites, and a low stability [50,51] . 

Another critical point of the Ni and Ni-based catalysts is their 
high  onset  potential  (around  0.35 V  (vs.  Ag/AgCl)),  which  indi- 
cates that their application in real FCs is still far from realization 
considering the low cathodic potential in basic solution (theoret- 
ical  0.2 V  (vs.  Ag/AgCl))  [52] .  In  this  respect,  different  strategies 
have been developed to enhance the catalytic performance of Ni 
and Ni-based materials, such as: i) alloying Ni with other metal- 
lic  and  non-metallic  elements  [53–55] ,  ii)  increasing  the  surface 
area, iii) preparing non-metal-oxide Ni-based catalysts (e.g., metal 
phosphide [56–58] , selenides, and sulﬁdes [59,60] ) which exhibit 
higher electrical conductivities than metal oxides and hydroxides, 
iv) preparing nickel-free nonprecious catalysts, and v) prepare the 
catalysts in-situ on the surface of an electrically conductive porous 
electrode. 

Various techniques have been applied to increase the surface 
area of the catalyst, including: i) using a high-surface-area catalyst 
support (e.g., carbon nanoﬁbers (CNFs), carbon nanotubes (CNTs) 
[61] , graphene, and carbon sponges [62,63] ), ii) designing catalysts 
with  new  surface  morphology  and  structure  (e.g.,  Ni  nanowires 
[64] and Ni nanoribbons [65] ), and iii) using zeolites [66,67] and 
metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) [20,68–70] . 

Recently,  a  number  of  studies  have  summarized  the  progress 
in preparing Ni-based catalysts for urea oxidation [71–73] ; how- 
ever, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have reviewed the 
work toward preparing Ni-based catalysts in direct alcohol FCs (i.e., 
methanol and ethanol). Moreover, the advances made in preparing 
non-oxide Ni catalysts, Ni-free nonprecious catalysts, and zeolite-

and  MOF-based  materials  have  not  been  introduced  yet,  despite 
their importance. 

The main purpose of this review is to discuss the discrepan- 
cies between theoretical considerations and the current status of 
research on non-precious-metal catalysts based on the differences 
between reported in-situ and ex-situ data. Here, the various strate- 
gies applied to increase the activity of Ni-based catalysts toward 
methanol, ethanol, and urea oxidation, to improve FC performance, 
are summarized and evaluated. 

This  review  is  organized  as  follows:  Section  2  summarizes 
the theoretical considerations and current status of non-precious- 
metal-based  catalysts.  Section  3  summarizes  and  describes  the 
mechanisms  of  urea  and  simple-alcohol  oxidation  over  Ni  cat- 
alyst  in  alkaline  media.  Section  4  presents  various  methods 
and  strategies  to  increase  the  electrochemical  oxidation  activ- 
ity  of  Ni.  Section  5  describes  the  progress  in  preparing  crys- 
talline porous materials, i.e., MOFs and zeolite. Section 6 summa- 
rizes the progress done in preparing Ni-free nonprecious catalyst. 
Section 7 highlights the progress made in preparing a standalone 
electrode.  Finally,  Section  8  discusses  the  remaining  challenges, 
provides recommendations for future work or opportunities, and 
presents concluding remarks on the subject. 

2. Nonprecious anodic catalyst, theoretical considerations, and 
current status 

The  reactions  of  alkaline  FCs  using  methanol  (Eqs.  (1)–(3)), 
ethanol  (Eqs.  (4)–(6)),  and  urea  (Eqs.  (7)–(9)),  can  be  expressed 
by the following reactions at standard temperature and pressure, 
Table 1 . 

Under  alkaline  conditions,  Ni-based  catalysts  are  known  as 
the  best  active  nonprecious  catalysts  toward  methanol,  ethanol, 
and urea oxidation [65,78–83] . The reported onset potentials for 
methanol, ethanol, and urea using a three-electrode cell structure 
are approximately 0.35 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) [84–86] . These are signif- 
icantly higher than the theoretical value, as shown in the above 

equations, or even those obtained using a Pt catalyst [87–89] . For 
instance  the  onset  potential  of  methanol  oxidation  (1 M)  in  1 M 
KOH at 50 mV s −1 over Ni catalyst (deposited on the surface of re- 
duced graphene oxide (rGO)) is approximately 0.35 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) 
( Fig. 1 b), compared to −0.5 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in the case of Pt/C un- 
der the same operating conditions ( Fig. 1 a) [90] , indicating that Ni 
has a higher over-potential by 0.85 V compared to that of Pt/C. 

Using 0.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) (theoretical cathodic potential) for the 
oxygen reduction in an alkaline media where the anodic onset po- 
tentials are measured in a three-electrode cell structure, an OCV of 
0.8 V is expected in the case of a Pt-anode catalyst, whereas a neg- 
ative OCV is expected in the case of anodic Ni-based catalysts (i.e., 
nonspontaneous FC reactions). Therefore, some researchers consid- 
ered that Ni-based catalysts are effective for the electrolysis of low- 
molecular-weight hydrocarbons, whereas they are ineffective cata- 
lysts for FC applications [91,92] . 

Recently,  however,  Ni-based  catalysts  have  been  successfully 
used  in  actual  FC  conﬁgurations,  showing  high  OCV  values 
[93] that contradict previous expectations. This section highlights 
and discusses such contradictions and explains the difference be- 
tween  the  onset  potential  measured  using  a  three-electrode  cell 
structure, i.e., ex-situ evaluations, and that measured using a two- 
electrode  cell  structure,  i.e.,  in-situ  measurements.  Also,  various 
methods  used  for  increasing  cell  voltage  are  presented  and  dis- 
cussed. 

2.1. Difference between in-situ and ex-situ onset potentials 

Using anodic Ni-based catalysts, the actual FC operation (using 
a two-electrode cell structure) demonstrated high OCV [94–100] . 
Direct  urea  fuel  cell  (DUFC)  using  Ni/C  anode,  and  MnO 
2  cath- 
ode exhibited an OCV of 0.43 V at room temperature with a power 
output of 0.27 mW cm −2 using 1 M urea ( Fig. 2 a) [77] . When the 
cathode was humidiﬁed, the OCV and power increased to 0.65 V 
and 1.3 mW cm −2 , respectively ( Fig. 2 b) [101] . The signiﬁcant in- 
crease in the performance with humidiﬁcation was related to the

cathode potential. Xu et al. studied the relation between the ex- 
situ and in-situ onset potentials for electrodes of Ni-doped with 
different percentages of Co [94] . Their ﬁndings are summarized by 
the following points: i) the ex-situ onset potentials for urea oxida- 
tion of Ni/C using different cobalt percentages in 1 M KOH are typ- 
ical to those reported in the literature in the range of 0.3–0.4 V vs. 
Hg/HgO, ii) a high OCV between 0.55 and 0.65 V is obtained for the 
different anodic catalysts, iii) there is a direct relationship between 
the ex-situ onset potential and the in-situ OCV; for instance, a de- 
crease of 100 mV in the ex-situ onset potential (using 20% Co) re- 
sulted in an increase in the OCV by 100 mV, and iv) the ex-situ val- 
ues of the anodic current density and the onset potential are useful 
indicators for the in-situ cell performance (two-electrode conﬁgu- 
ration). 

Despite the important ﬁndings reported by Xu et al. [94] , they 
did not report the in-situ anodic and/or cathodic potentials. For- 
tunately, the in-situ electrode potentials of membrane-less direct 
urea microﬂuidic FCs using Ni/C of various morphologies and Pt/C 
as a cathode were reported by Zhang et al. [102] ( Fig. 3 ). 

The following main points are concluded from this work: i) An 
ex-situ onset potential of 0.4 V vs. Hg/HgO has observed for Ni de- 
posited on different carbon supports ( Fig. 3 a). ii) In-situ measure- 
ments showed an OCV of more than 0.9 V ( Fig. 3 b), iii) The in-situ 
anodic onset potentials are entirely different from the ex-situ val- 
ues. For instance, the in-situ anode potentials are approximately 
−0.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) for the different catalysts ( Fig. 3 c), which are 
0.6 V  lower  than  those  measured  using  the  three-electrode  cell 
structure,  0.4 V  ( Fig.  3 a).  Importantly,  this  study  demonstrated  a 

signiﬁcant  difference  between  the  ex-situ  and  in-situ  onset  po- 
tentials; therefore, the ex-situ onset potential should not be used 
for calculating the cell voltage. The difference between the in-situ 
and ex-situ onset potentials could be related to the difference in 
the operating conditions, i.e., direct contact between the electrodes 
and a solid membrane in the in-situ measurements, compared to 
immersing the electrode in liquid electrolyte in ex-situ measure- 
ments. However, the exact reason is not clear yet, and further work 
is required to clear the reason(s) for such a big difference between 
them. 

The above discussion demonstrates that nonprecious anode cat- 
alysts  are  successfully  used  in  real  FC  applications,  exhibiting  a 
high power density of 27 mW cm −2 at room temperature (20 °C) 
[103] , which is higher than those reported using high Pt–Ru load- 
ing of 8–12 mg cm −2 [104–106] . 

To further increase the cell voltage of direct low-hydrocarbon 
FCs using anodic nonprecious catalysts, researchers used different 
strategies, such as studying the effect of pH at the anode and cath- 
ode and replacing the oxygen by applying other oxidants at the 
cathode, which are summarized in the following section. 

2.2. Methods to increase cathode potential 

Although using a basic solution signiﬁcantly increases the cat- 
alytic activity toward the oxidation of various fuels at the anode 
side, the theoretical cathode potential is too low (0.4 V (vs. SHE) 
at pH = 14), compared to that under acidic conditions (1.23 V (vs. 
SHE)).  Thus,  researchers  have  developed  various  methods  to  in- 
crease the cathode potential, while maintaining high activity using 
a basic anodic solution. Such methods are summarized in Fig. 4 a.

methanol fuel cell, and (b) Relationship between common reference electrodes. 

As shown in Fig. 4 a, altering the cathode operating condition from 
alkaline (using oxygen oxidant) to acidic (using H 
2 ) resulted in 
an  increase  in  the  cell  voltage  by  a  factor  of  2.14,  from  1.21  to 
2.59 V vs. SHE, when the anode was operated under alkaline con- 
ditions.

Fig. 4b shows the relationship between different reference elec- 
trodes.  It  worth  mentioning  that  when  converting  electrode  po- 
tential to or from SHE, the pH value must be considered. For in- 
stance E(SHE) = E (SCE) + 0.241 + 0.0591 pH [107] is used for con- 
verting between SCE and SHE.

and Naﬁon 115 membrane; a high cell voltage of 0.92 V and power 
density of 7.4 mWcm −2 at room temperature were obtained [97] . 
The  high  cell  voltage  is  attributed  to  the  high  theoretical  cath- 
ode  potential  of  H 
2  in  acidic  media  (1.78 V  (vs.  SHE)),  com- 
pared  to  0.4 V  (vs.  SHE)  in  the  case  of  oxygen  in  alkaline  me- 
dia.  The  electrode  and  overall  cell  reaction  were  described  in

In addition to the high theoretical reduction potential of H 
2 , 
hydrogen peroxide is easy to store and requires less pumping en- 
ergy; which results in an easier heat management of the fuel cell 
2 reduction is faster than that 
2 O 
[108] . Moreover, the kinetics of H 
of  O 
2  has  a  great  potential  to  be 
2 O 
2  reduction  [109,110] ,  so  H 
used  as  a  cathode  oxidant.  However,  despite  of  the  several  ad- 
vantages of using H 
2 , it has been reported that exposing of a 
Naﬁon membrane to this substance for prolonged times results in 
a loss of its conductivity due the destruction of the ion clusters 
in the membrane by H 
2 [111] . This effect is signiﬁcantly accel- 
erated by the presence of traces of metal ions such as Fe 2 + , Pt 2 + , 
Ni + 2 , Cr 2 + , Cu 2 + , and Co 2 + in H 
2 [112] . Introducing a peroxide- 
2 O 
decomposition catalyst within the membrane is considered as an 
2 [113] , for instance, 
effective way to reduce its degradation by H 
a composite membrane consisting of Naﬁon and ZrO 
2  nanoparti- 
cles was found to improve the durability of the Naﬁon membrane. 
The ZrO 
2  nanoparticles embedded in the membrane decomposed 
2 species that had permeated into it, thus lowering their 
2 O 
the H 
concentration  [114] .  Also,  cerium  composite  membranes  demon- 
strated a high stability in the case of both Naﬁon and sulfonated 
poly (ether ether ketone) [115,116] .

Metal ions are another type of non-oxygen-based oxidants that 
are effectively used at the cathode of low-temperature FCs. For in- 
stance, chromium ions (Cr IV) in wastewater were effectively used 
in  direct  urine/Cr(VI)  [117] ,  with  a  theoretical  potential  value  of 
1.33 V (vs. SHE) at the cathode according to the following equa-

A specially designed cell conﬁguration can instantaneously treat 
the wastewaters and produce energy using the metal ion oxidants. 
Fig.  5 a  shows  a  cell  consisting  of  an  anode  (Ni/C)  in  urine  so- 
lution, a middle chamber with anion and cation exchange mem- 
branes separated by KCl solution, and a cathode (carbon cloth) in 
chromium wastewater solution. This produced a maximum power 
of 3.5 mWcm −2 with an OCV of 1.3 V ( Fig. 5b ) and simultaneously 
treated the wastewater at the anode (i.e., urine removal) and the 
cathode (i.e., heavy metal removal: Cr IV ( Fig. 5 c). 

3. Mechanism of urea and simple alcohol oxidation over Ni 
catalyst in alkaline media 

Understanding the reaction mechanism at the molecular level 
is essential for developing active, non-precious-metal-based cata- 
lysts for urea and simple-alcohol oxidation. This section includes a 
complete description of the urea-oxidation process at the molecu- 
lar level. Upon the exposure of Ni to air, it spontaneously oxidizes 
into NiO, which in turn forms Ni(OH) 
2 in water or even in humid 
air:

formed, which is converted into a more stable form (namely, β- 
Ni(OH) 
2 )  at  high  potentials  [119,120] .  With  a  further  increase  in 
2 is converted into β-NiOOH, which is par- 
the potential, β-Ni(OH) 
tially converted into ϒ-NiOOH at 0.35 V (vs. Hg/HgO) and reduced 
back to β-Ni(OH) 
2 during the reverse scan [121] . 

The cyclic voltammograms of Ni in the fuel-free alkali demon- 
strated redox peaks at 387 mV (vs. Hg/HgO) in the forward scan 
and 260 mV (vs. Hg/HgO) in the backward scan, these correspond

Upon the addition of urea or other fuels, a signiﬁcant increase 
in  the  current  density  is  noticed  around  0.35 V  (vs.  Hg/HgO)  in 
the  forward  scan,  indicating  that  NiOOH  ( β-NiOOH)  is  the  ac- 
tive site [123–125] . In the following section, the proposed mech- 
anism  for  the  oxidation  of  urea  and  other  simple  alcohols  over 
the surface of non-precious catalysts (i.e., Ni) in alkaline media is 
explained. 

3.1. Urea oxidation 

Several  studies  have  been  performed  to  illustrate  the  mech- 
anism  of  urea  oxidation  over  Ni  catalysts  in  alkaline  media 
[123,126–128] , through indirect and direct reactions, as explained 
below. 

In the case of the indirect reaction, the process takes place in 
two steps: ﬁrst, the electrooxidation of Ni(OH) 
2 to form NiOOH oc- 
curs, releasing electrons ( Eq. (19) ). Then, the chemical oxidation of 
urea to produce CO 

2, and water ( Eq. (20) ) [129,130] :

However,  in  case  of  the  direct  reaction,  urea  is  directly  ox- 
idized  over  NiOOH  [127,131,132]  according  to  the  following  Eqs.

Nevertheless, it should be noted that some researchers reported 
that  both  mechanisms  could  take  place  at  the  same  time  [131] . 
Daramola  et  al.  studied  the  decomposition  of  urea  into  HCNO, 
NCO −,  NH 
2  on  the  surface  of  the  Ni  catalyst  by 
density functional theory (DFT) [128] . The authors proposed that 
urea  initially  adsorbs  on  the  surface  of  NiOOH  through  the  for- 
mation of a bridge between Ni and the N or O atoms in the urea 
molecule. Urea then dissociates through one of three different pro- 
posed reaction paths (see Table 2 ). In reaction paths 1 and 2, the 
H  atoms  removed  from  the  two  amine  groups  one  by  one,  fol- 
lowed by bonding of the two nitrogen atoms in an intermediate 
step, whereas, the bonding of the nitrogen atoms in path 3 occurs 
before the complete removal of the hydrogen atoms from the two 
amine groups.

4.1. Alloying 

4.1.1. Transition metals/metal oxides 

It has been found that the alloying of Ni with transition met- 
als  such  as  Co  [137] ,  Cr  [138] ,  Sn  [139,140] ,  Zn  [103] ,  Mn  [141] , 
Mg  [124] ,  Cu  [142] ,  and  Al  [143]  resulted  in  increasing  its  ac- 
tivity.  Co  is  a  well-known  transition  metal  that  signiﬁcantly  in- 
creased  the  oxidation  activity  of  Ni  toward  methanol  [144–148] , 
ethanol [149] , and urea [150] . Regardless of the fuel used, an in- 
crease in the Co content in the NiCo alloys resulted in a general 
decrease  in  the  onset  potential  [149–151]  due  to  the  formation 
of  CoOOH  at  lower  potential  than  that  of  Ni.  Notably,  an  onset 
potential  of  0.11 V  (vs.  Ag/AgCl)  is  the  lowest  value  reported  for 
methanol oxidation in alkaline media using Ni0.5Co0.5/CNF [145] , 
and −50 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl) was reported in the case of ethanol us- 
ing Ni0.1Co0.9/CNF [149] . However, Co cannot act as a standalone 
catalyst,  and  thus,  the  increase  in  its  content  beyond  a  certain 
level resulted in decreasing current generation, due to the decrease 
of the Ni catalyst [149,152,153] . For instance, doping Ni with 10% 
Co  (Ni0.9Co0.1/CNF)  slightly  decreased  the  onset  potential  from 
320 to 310 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl), and a signiﬁcant increase in the cur- 
rent density from 41 to 100 mA cm −2  was obtained at 0.7 V (vs. 
Ag/AgCl) using 3 M ethanol. Further, an increase in the Co content 
(Ni0.1Co0.9/CNF) resulted in a decrease in both the onset potential 
(less than −50 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl)) and the current density (less than 
50 mA cm −2 ) [149] . Therefore, an optimum Co content is required 
to achieve the highest current density and the lowest onset poten- 
tial. A hydrothermally prepared urchin-like NiCo 
4 demonstrated 
high methanol oxidation activity [154] , where both Ni + 2 /Ni + 3 and 
Co + 2 /Co + 3 are considered as active sites [155–158] as follows (as- 
suming complete oxidation into CO 
NiC o 2 O 4 +  O H

2 +  2 C O 2 + 3 H 2 O  (43) 

The increase in the Co content in NiCo hydroxides yielded a de- 
crease in the current density and the onset potential, whereas in 
the metal form, the lowest onset potential was obtained at 75% Co, 
and the highest current obtained at 54% Co [152] . The methanol 
oxidation activity of NiCo alloys not only depends on the oxide or 
hydroxide form [152] , but also on the crystalline structure [161] . 
An acicular and rough surface of Co 
5  (hcp structure) showed 
higher oxidation activity toward urea (with a lower onset potential 
by 57 mV and a higher anodic current density by a factor of two), 
compared to the case of an fcc structure (ﬁne-grained morphology) 
[161] . 

7 Ni 

The improved performance with Co alloying is ascribed to the 
following  reasons:  i)  the  role  of  Co  as  a  CO  tolerance  material 
by providing OH groups and/or a ligand effect [162–166] ; ii) the 
ability of Co to adsorb fuel (ethanol) molecules on its surface by 
the  interaction  of  free  electron  pairs  of  the  O-atom  of  the  fuel 
(ethanol) to the partially vacant d-orbital of Co and its role as a 
CO anti-poisoning agent [165,166] ; iii) Co effectively works as a co- 
catalyst for methanol oxidation [167] , where it acts as a chemical 
modiﬁer  of  structural  and/or  electronic  effects  [168,169] ,  and  iv) 
Co enhances the oxidation state of Ni, thereby promoting electron 
transfer [170,171] . 

Alloying  of  Ni  with  Mn  also  improved  its  oxidation  activity 
[141,172–174] . Ni–Mn alloy (prepared using 90 wt% Ni acetate and 
10 wt% Mn acetate) exhibited a low urea oxidation onset poten- 
tial of −0.085 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The authors related the high activity 
of the Ni–Mn alloys to their crystalline structure (similar to that of 
2 [141] , 
precious catalysts) [172] , the high fuel absorbability on MnO 

Fig. 6.  Schematic diagram of ethanol oxidation over a Ni catalyst in alkaline media 
[135] . 

In all the reaction paths, the last reaction (i.e., CO 

2 removal) is 
the rate-determining step, as clearly supported from the highest 
free energy and the lowest reaction rate constant as conﬁrmed by 
other researchers [123,128,133] . Moreover, CO 
2 is found to be the 
main reason for the degradation of urea oxidation compared to CO 
because it reacts with the Ni catalyst to form inactive nickel car- 
bonate [134] . 

3.2. Simple alcohols oxidation 

Although  urea  can  be  entirely  oxidized  into  CO 

2 ,  as 
shown  above,  several  researchers  have  reported  that  simple  al- 
cohols  are  partially  oxidized  to  form  acetate  acid  in  the  case  of 
ethanol [85,135] , and format in the case of methanol [136] accord- 
ing to Eqs. (37) –( 40 ) and as shown in Fig. 6: However, still further 
work is needed to clear the detailed reaction mechanism.

Although Ni is the best reported nonprecious catalyst for the 
oxidation  of  light  hydrocarbons  such  as  methanol,  ethanol,  and 
urea  in  alkaline  media,  Ni  activity  is  still  lower  than  that  of 
Pt-based catalysts. Therefore, researchers have used different ap- 
proaches for increasing the oxidation activity of Ni such as alloying, 
using different supports or catalysts with high surface area, prepar- 
ing  non-oxide  Ni  catalysts,  and  using  zeolite  and  MOFs.  These 
methods are discussed in detail in this section.

1.79, and 0.91 mA cm −2 for NiMn 
4 , and NiO, respec- 
tively, at 0.5 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The high activity of Ni 
4 was 
related to the facile formation of NiOOH and the presence of three 
2oct O 
different phases: (Mn) tet (NiMn) 
Mg is another transition metal that resulted in increasing the 
Ni oxidation activity toward methanol and ethanol [124] . The Ni–
MgO  prepared on  the  surface  of  carbon  using  electro-deposition 
exhibited high activity in terms of current and stability compared 
to  those  of  Ni/C.  The  improved  performance  was  related  to  the 
role  of  Mg  in  promoting  the  formation  of  β-NiOOH  (active  site 
for oxidation) at the expense of γ -NiOOH. Additionally, NiCu alloys 
showed high activity toward methanol [177,178] , ethanol [179,180] , 
and urea oxidation [125] . The alloying of Ni with Cu resulted in Cu 
electrons ﬁlling the Ni D-band vacancies, which inhibited the vol- 
ume expansion of Ni ions during the oxidation of alcohols in alka- 
line media [181] , and led to a synergetic effect in the case of NiCu 
[182–184] . The ternary NiCoCu alloy exhibited the highest activity 
toward methanol oxidation compared to that of any of the Ni–Cu 
or Ni–Co binary alloys [185] . The same ﬁnding was obtained when 
a ternary alloy of CuCoNi, deposited on the surface of glassy car- 
bon (GC) modiﬁed by CNTs, was used toward methanol oxidation, 
whereas the standalone CuO and CoO showed poor methanol oxi- 
dation activities [186] . The improved activity was related to: i. the 
role of Co and Cu as co-catalysts, especially in the case of Co that 
had one of its CoOOH redox at a potential of 0.07 V vs. SCE [187] , 
and ii. the synergism between NiO and the other two oxides, i.e., 
CoO and CuO, which resulted in more transformation of Ni II into 
Ni III [94,188] . 

60 Cr 

NiCr alloy is one of the few nonprecious catalysts that showed 
relatively high activity toward hydrogen oxidation under actual FC 
operation  [189] ,  and  thus,  it  was  expected  to  show  high  oxida- 
tion activity for low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons. Although Cr 
has no activity toward urea oxidation, an alloy containing 40 Cr 
(Ni 
40 /C)  exhibited  high  urea  oxidation  reaction  (UOR)  activ- 
ity compared with NiCr alloys containing different percentages of 
Cr  [190] .  Alloying  Ni  with  Cr  resulted  in  good  dispersion  of  Ni 
with small nuclei over the carbon support, easier charge transfer 
conﬁrmed from the small semicircle in electrochemical impedance 
spectroscopy  (EIS)  spectra,  and  higher  kinetics  of  urea  oxidation 
from the lower Tafel slop compared to that of Ni/C and/or other 
NiCr/C alloys. The improved performance was ascribed to the role 
of  Cr  in  decreasing  the  density  of  states  (DOS)  of  the  D-band 
through weakening the Ni –O bond [189] , and the enhancement in 
the formation of the Ni 
II  redox couples [191] , as reported in 
cases of methanol [138] and ethanol [192] . 

III /Ni 

Other metals such as Fe, Sn, and Cd also augmented the oxi- 
dation activity of Ni catalysts. Fe 
3  strongly enhanced the elec- 
2 O 
trochemical  oxidation  activity  of  Ni  [193] ,  where  Ni–Fe  acted  as 
a bifunctional electrocatalyst for urea oxidation [194,195] . Further- 
more,  adding  Fe  to  Ni  increased  electrical  conductivity,  increas- 
ing the charge transfer rate. Sn alloying with Ni did not improve 
the activity of Ni toward methanol oxidation in terms of the on- 
set potential and current density, but the NiSn nanoparticles (NPs) 
showed  high  stability  compared  to  that  of  Ni  [139] .  The  role  of 
Sn in the stability enhancement of Ni toward methanol oxidation 
is attributed to the function of OH − adsorbed on the Sn surface 

3 Sn 

on oxidizing the adsorbed intermediates, as well as the incorpora- 
tion of Sn in the Ni structure (Ni 
2 ), which modiﬁes the elec- 
tronic  structure  of  Ni.  A  NiCd  alloy  (7%Ni–93%  Cd)  prepared  by 
electrodeposition  on  the  surface  of  a  graphite  electrode  showed 
high activity toward methanol oxidation in alkaline media, com- 
pared with that of Ni/graphite (anodic peak of 230 mA cm −2 com- 
pared with 107 mA cm −2 ), whereas pure Cd showed no activity to- 
ward methanol oxidation [196] . The high activity was ascribed to 
the high surface area and porosity of the NiCd catalyst, as well as 
the strong electronic effect of Cd. Table 3 summarizes the roles of 
the different elements in enhancing the activity of Ni catalyst.

Recently,  there  has  been  much  interest  in  metal  phosphates, 
owing to their unique chemical and physical properties and sim- 
ple preparation methods [198–202] . Through ionic bonds, Ni can 
combine with nonmetals such as phosphorus, for instance, reﬂux 
method was used to fabricate nickel phosphate NPs of size 70 nm 
and  speciﬁc  surface  area  22.3  m 2  g −1  [201] .  The  prepared  ma- 
terials  demonstrated  high  oxidation  activity  and  stability  toward 
−3  ions  to  small  or- 
urea  due  to  the  high  absorbability  of  PO 
4 
ganic  molecules,  and  the  presence  of  the  backbone  structure  of 
phosphate (high corrosion resistivity), respectively. A redox peak 
at 0.48 V was associated with Ni 
2 , which is 
considered  an  active  site  for  urea  oxidation  [203,204] .  Ammo- 
nium nickel phosphate ((NH 
2 O) was calcined at differ- 
4 )NiPO 
ent temperatures (30 0, 60 0, and 90 0 °C), producing β-nickel py- 
rophosphate  ( β-Ni 
7 ),  and  their  activity  and  properties  were 
investigated by Meguerdichian et al. [205] . A relatively amorphous 
β-Ni 
7 was obtained at 300 °C with the highest electrochem- 
ical  active  surface  area  (ECSA)  of  142  cm 2  mg −1  compared  to 
115 cm 2 mg −1 for the pristine sample ((NH 
2 O). How- 
ever, increasing the calcination temperature resulted in decreases 
in the ECSA to 130 and 44 cm 2  mg −1  for β-Ni 
7  obtained at 
60 0 and 90 0 °C, respectively, as well as reducing the porosity. As a 
result, the β-Ni 
7 obtained at 300 °C exhibited the highest urea 
oxidation activity, which was related to the exposure of high Ni + 2 
active sites with heat treatment [205] . In contrast, the nickel phos- 
phate prepared by the heat treatment of ammonium nickel phos- 
phate at 90 0 °C (NP-90 0) exhibited the highest ethanol oxidation 
activity  of  62.36  μA  peak  anodic  current,  compared  to  29.4  and 
8.36 μA for NP-700 and NP-500, respectively, using 3 M ethanol in 
0.5 M NaOH at 50 mV s −1 [206] . The high activity of NP-900 was 
attributed to the largest surface area of 21.7 m 2 g −1 , the existence 
4 ) 
of  the  single  highly  crystalline  structure  of  Ni 
2  at  900 °C 
7  for NP-700 
compared with the mixture of Ni 
(with  ESCA  of  6.6  m 2  g −1 ),  and  the  amorphous  structure  (with 
ESCA of 5.6 m 2 g −1 ) for NP-500. Various morphologies of Ni and/or 
Co phosphides and/or phosphates have been successfully prepared 
using the hydrothermal method at different molar ratios of Co to 
Ni  salts  of  0.053  (NiCoP-1),  0.018  (NiCoP-2),  0.33  (NiCoP-3),  and 
1 (NiCoP-4) [207] . Interestingly, in methanol-free KOH (0.5 M), an 
increase  in  the  Co/Ni  ratio  resulted  in  shifting  the  redox  peaks 
from 0.35 V vs. SCE for NiCoPO-1 and NiCoPO-2 to 0.5 V vs. SCE for 
NiCoPO-3 and NiCoPO-4. The ﬁrst redox peak (0.35 V) is related to 
2 to NiOOH, and the second is ascribed to 
the oxidation of Ni(OH) 
the oxidation of CoOOH to CoO 
2  and vice versa [208,209] . More- 
over, NiCoPO-2 exhibited boarder redox peaks and larger enclosed 
CV areas, indicating the overlapped contribution of the Ni and Co 
redox peaks [208] and high electrochemical activity [210] , respec- 
tively. In the presence of 1 M MeOH, NiCoPO-2 showed the high- 
est current density and the lowest onset potential. These results 
highlighted  the  importance  of  optimizing  the  Co  content,  which 
acts as a chemical modiﬁer to allow Ni to reach a higher oxidation 
state and facilitate the electron transfer, thereby augmenting the 
methanol oxidation [123–125,210] . The authors also reported the

- Reduces the onset potential, but at the expense of the current density; therefore, there is an

- Increases defects and ﬁlm breakage, and thus increases surface area.

- Ni reaction reaches higher oxidation states and reduces onset potential while maintaining a 

high current density.

- Increases electron conductivity and adsorption of the fuel. 
- Ni exists in Ni 3 + 
- Sm results in weakening the adsorption of the intermediates, and thus reducing poisoning. 
- P has a surplus of valence electrons, which results in modifying the electronic structure of Ni. 
- P also reduces corrosion. 
- Increases reversibility and amorphous structure enhances Ni dispersion, eliminates water 

oxidation, and decreases onset potential. Cr also decreases the density of states of the D-band 
through weakening the Ni-O bond. 

- Increases electrical conductivity, and reduces poisoning. 
- Increases number of active sites increases wettability, increases electron conductivity, and 

decreases the energy barrier for intermediate formation. 

- Renders the electronic structure similar to those of precious catalysts, and reduces the 

poisoning effect. 

- Increases ECSA and electrical conductivity. 
- Shifts down the D-band center of Ni, and results in uniform and good dispersion of the 

catalyst.

possibility that electron tunneling between adjacent metal phos- 
phates and phosphides would also enhance the electron transfer 
through the NiCoPO catalyst [211] . 

4.2. Non-oxide metal 

Non-oxide metals such as metal phosphides, nitrides, carbides, 
sulﬁdes, selenides, and others, are class of materials that showed 
superior electrocatalytic activities compared to those of the rele- 
vant metal oxides and thus showed excellent activity in many ap- 
plications, such as electrochemistry, catalysis, and sensing technol- 
ogy [212,213] . Metal non-oxides (with low electronegativity com- 
pared to that of oxygen) have superior physicochemical properties 
compared with metal oxides, owing to the electron-rich bonds in 
their outer layer structure and the tunable interaction between the 
non-oxygen element and the metal [214,215] . 

4.2.1. Metal carbides and nitrides 

Metal carbides and nitrides are considered as best candidates 
to replace Pt soon. Since Levy and Boudart discovered that tung- 
sten  carbides  displayed  Pt-like  behavior  in  several  catalytic  re- 
actions, extensive fundamental research has been carried out on 
metal carbides and nitrides [216,217] . These investigations demon- 
strated that carbides and nitrides are suitable catalysts for a wide 
variety of reactions that typically utilized group-VIII noble metals 
as catalysts. During the alloying of M- with non-oxygen atoms such 
as carbon and nitrogen, the space between the two atoms is en- 
larged and, therefore, the density of the unoccupied d-orbitals is 
decreased due to the band contraction. As a result, the DOS around 
the  Fermi  level  and  consequently,  catalytic  properties  similar  to 
those of noble metals are obtained [218–220] . 

Transition metal carbides can be formed when carbon atoms, 
produced by the decomposition of hydrocarbons or other carbon- 
containing molecules, are incorporated into interstitial metal sites 
[221] . The interstitial carbides and nitrides of early transition met- 

als (groups IVB-VIB) have unique physical and chemical properties 
[222,223] ,  which  make  them  good  candidates  for  various  appli- 
cations  such  as  heterogeneous  catalysis  with  higher  activity,  se- 
lectivity, and resistivity to poisoning compared with their parent 
metals [224–227] . Upon the formation of interstitial compounds, 
the metal lattice expands and the metal-metal distance increases, 
which  causes  a  contraction  of  the  metal  D-band,  resulting  in  a 
greater  DOS  near  the  Fermi  level,  as  compared  with  the  parent 
metal [228] . Owing to the outstanding properties of metal carbides 
and nitrides, they have demonstrated promising results in energy 
conversion/storage devices [229–232] . 

Tungsten carbide nanoﬁbers (NFs) prepared by the carbother- 
mal  reduction  of  tungsten  oxide  NFs  obtained  from  the  calcina- 
tion of polyvinyl pyridine (PVP) NFs containing ammonium meta- 
tungstate, at 700 °C [233] , exhibited low methanol oxidation activ- 
ity in acidic media. When Ni NPs were supported with tungsten 
carbide (WC) on carbon or CNT, the catalytic activity toward urea 
oxidation was improved, compared with that of Ni, despite the low 
activity of WC toward urea oxidation [234–237] . These results are 
ascribed to increase in the surface area of the Ni nanoclusters over 
the WC surface and the synergetic electron transfer between the 
Ni and WC, which facilitate the scission of the C–N bond and pro- 
moting the oxidation of the hydrocarbon into CO 
2  without form- 
ing CO and other poisoning intermediates. In contrast, a mixture 
of mesoporous carbon and mesoporous WC showed an activity to- 
ward methanol oxidation in acidic media with an over-potential of 
only 200 mV ( Fig. 7 ) compared to that of Pt. This can be attributed 
to the importance of the mesoporous structure that increases the 
surface area of the WC and prevents carbon deposition over the 
surface of the WC [238] . 

Silicon carbide (NiO/SiC) supported by CNTs exhibited high cat- 
alytic activity toward methanol oxidation; however, the signiﬁcant 
increase in the activity was related to the excellent dispersion of 
Ni over the Ni NPs/SiC and CNTs, the smooth electron transfer be- 
tween the catalyst and the support, as well as the easy mass trans- 
fer in the three-dimensional network-like structure [239] .

4.2.2. Transition metal phosphides, selenides, sulﬁdes, and borides 

P  is  one  of  the  nonmetals  that  has  a  surplus  of  valence 
electrons,  and  it  can  react  with  most  of  the  elements  in  the 
periodic  table.  P  regulates  the  electronic  structure  of  Ni,  where 
the  electron  density  of  Ni  metal  clusters  is  changed  to  provide 
a more signiﬁcant number of active sites [240] . Moreover, P is a 
nonmetal  with  high  corrosion  resistivity  [241] .  Transition  metal 
phosphides  showed  higher  electrochemical  activity  compared 
to  transition  metal  oxides  or  hydroxides,  owing  to  their  high 
electrical conductivity [50,242,243] . Furthermore, transition metal 
phosphides  contain  higher  surface  electron  content  compared  to 
those of nitrides, carbides, and sulﬁdes [244] . Nickel phosphides 
(NiP)  demonstrated  high  activity  toward  methanol,  ethanol,  and 
urea  oxidation  [50] .  However,  combining  phosphide  with  samar- 
ium (Sm, an abundant metal with catalytic activity owing to its 
incomplete  4f  level)  enhanced  the  Ni  oxidation  activity  toward 
urea. The ternary alloy of Ni 
5 Sm-P/C demonstrated superior oxi- 
dation activity toward urea, with the highest anodic peak current 
density of 325 mA cm −2 g −1 at 0.45 V vs. Hg/HgO, compared with 
5 Sm/C,  and  Ni/C  [245] .  Interestingly,  adding 
those  of  Ni–P/C,  Ni 
5 Sm–P/C)  decreases  the  onset  potential 
P  (Ni–P/C)  or  Sm–P  (Ni 
of  Ni/C,  signifying  that  P  and  Sm  promote  Ni  to  reach  a  higher 
oxidation state (NiOOH), decrease the overpotential for urea oxi- 
dation, and facilitate the electron transfer for urea oxidation [246] . 
Additionally, Cu-incorporated NiP (coupling of Cu and P) amended 
the  methanol  oxidation  activity,  owing  to  the  role  of  copper 
hydroxide/oxyhydroxide  in  methanol  oxidation,  as  well  as  the 
stabilization of the formation of β-NiOOH and suppression of α- 
NiOOH [247] . β-Ni(OH) 
2 is the active site for the electrochemical 
oxidation with low charge transfer resistivity [124,125,248] . 

NiSe  [249]  revealed  high  methanol  oxidation  activity  ( Fig.  8 ), 
which is higher than that of NiO and even that of Ni 
2 . This high 
methanol oxidation activity is due to the faster electron transfer in 
NiSe [250] than those in NiO and Ni 
2 , as conﬁrmed from the EIS 
measurements.

Boron (B) is another metalloid that resulted in increasing Ni ac- 
tivity toward ethanol oxidation [251–253] and methanol oxidation 
[254] . For instance, a Ni–B (5 wt% B) prepared on carbon electrode 
using  electroless  plating  showed  high  activity  toward  methanol 
and ethanol, higher by a factor of two than that of NiP/C [251] . 
The improved activity of NiB is due to B facilitating the organic 

oxidation and improve the catalyst stability thorough the removal 
of the intermediates from the catalyst surface [255] . Similar results 
were reported by Zhang et al. [256] , who demonstrated that the 
activity of amorphous NPs of Ni–B alloy, prepared on the surface of 
nanoporous Cu ﬁlm, had a lower ethanol oxidation onset potential 
(49 mV lower), and a signiﬁcant increase in the anodic peak cur- 
rent density (43.36 times higher), compared with those obtained 
using bulk Ni electrodes. 

In a similar work, Muench et al. reported that the activity of 
unsupported Ni-B nanotubes (NT), prepared by electroless plating 
on the surface of an ion-track-etched polymer template [253] , to- 
ward ethanol oxidation is higher than that of the Ni nanotubes (Ni 
NT) prepared by the same method. It showed 10 mV lower in the 
onset potential than that obtained for Ni NT, while the anodic peak 
current density was higher by 25% [253] . Importantly, changes in 
the  morphology  and  chemical  structure  of  the  support  of  Ni-B 
showed enhancement in the activity toward methanol oxidation. 
Compared to Ti-supported Ni–B, the Ni–B deposited on TiO 
2  NT 
revealed  signiﬁcant  improvement  in  the  performance  [254] .  The 
signiﬁcant increase in the performance was ascribed to the high 
2  NTs and its high methanol absorbability 
surface area of the TiO 
[257,258] . 

4.3. Other conﬁgurations 

The perovskite LaNiO 

3 exhibited a higher urea oxidation activity 
compared to NiO because the Ni + 3 form of Ni has a higher activity 
than Ni + 2  (in the case of NiO) [134] . At the cathode of the FCs, 
nitrogen-doped  carbon  materials  demonstrated  an  excellent  ORR 
activity, comparable to that of Pt [259–261] . The high ORR activ- 
ity of the nitrogen-doped materials was related to the role of ni- 
trogen in enriching the carbon surface with π -electrons, thus in- 
creasing the surface energy and the concentration of n-type carri- 
ers, and reducing the work-function [262] . At the anode of the FCs, 
nitrogen-doped carbon-supported Ni catalysts (i.e., NiNC-1, NiNC-2, 
NiNC-3, and NiNC-4) exhibited a superior ethanol oxidation activ- 
ity than carbon-supported ones. This ﬁnding can be explained as 
follows: 

Doping  of  the  carbon  support  with  nitrogen  improved  the 
catalytic  activity  [263–265] ,  because  of  the  n-type  or  metallic 
behavior  of  the  nitrogen  functional  groups,  which  change  the

ductivity  (due  to  the  lone  electron  pair  of  the  nitrogen  atom), 
and  improve  the  wettability  of  the  nitrogen-doped  supports 
[266–271] . 

Additionally,  nitrogen-doped  CNF  supports  (N-CNF)  were  pre- 
pared  by  electrospinning  a  mixture  of  polyacrylonitrile  (PAN), 
polyaniline  (PAi),  and  graphene  in  mass  ratios  of  10:2:0.3  fol- 
lowed  by  stabilization  and  calcination  at  800 °C  under  an  inert 
atmosphere [272] . These revealed not only a higher current den- 
sity (0.31 A cm −2  at 0.6 V vs. SCE compared to 0.22 A cm −2  for 
NiO s /CNF), but also a lower onset potential (300 mV vs. SCE com- 
pared to 380 mV vs. SCE for NiO s /CNF). This improved performance 
was  again  related  to  the  role  of  nitrogen,  as  also  conﬁrmed  by 
Thamer et al. [264] , who investigated the effects of nitrogen dop- 
ing on the activities of Ni/CNF [264] and Co/CNF [273] . 

Ni  NPs  of  size  2 nm  surrounded  by  a  thin  layer  of  nitrogen- 
doped  carbon  were  prepared  by  Shi  et  al.  [274]  via  the  heat 
treatment of glucose, urea, and nickel acetate. In addition to the 
small  size  of  the  Ni  NPs  (2 nm),  the  nitrogen-containing  func- 
tional groups and the porous carbon coating that provides high- 
conductivity surface area, gave the catalyst superior activity toward 
ethanol oxidation with a current density of 327 mA cm −2 at 0.63 V 
vs. SCE (using 1 M ethanol in 0.1 M NaOH). Adding MnO x  to the 
carbon  support  (7.5  wt%)  resulted  in  decreasing  the  size  of  the 
Ni  NPs  and  increasing  the  charge  transfer  rate,  thereby  increas- 
ing the activity of Ni toward methanol oxidation [275] . Similarly, 
microwave-assisted NaBH 
4 reduction of Ni on MnO x /C was found 
to be a useful technique for preparing small particles that enhance 
the activity toward methanol oxidation [276] . 

Ni/TiO 

2  NTs  exhibited  better  performance  when  illuminated 
compared  to  that  without  illumination,  especially  for  long-term 
operation [277] . The improved activity was related to the simul- 
taneous  methanol  electrooxidation,  photo-electrooxidation  under 
illumination  [278,279] ,  and  the  role  of  TiO 
2  NTs  in  adsorbing 
methanol [280] . The long-term stability under illumination was re- 
lated to the oxidation of intermediates as well as methanol by the 
2 O and OH − by the holes 
OH produced during the oxidation of H 
[281,282] . The effect of alloying of Ni with different elements (met- 
als and nonmetals) onset potential, anodic peak potential and cur- 
rent density is summarized in Table 4 . 

4.4. Increasing surface area 

The surface area of a catalyst directly affects its catalytic activ- 
ity. The higher surface area of the catalyst not only increases the 
number of active sites, which contribute to the oxidation activity 
of the catalyst but it also usually enhances the mass transfer be- 
tween the catalyst and the reactants and/or the electrolyte ions. 
Different strategies have been used for increasing the surface area, 
as discussed in the following section. 

4.4.1. New morphologies of the catalyst support 

Compared to conventional zero-dimensional catalyst supports, 
i.e., carbon nanoparticles, one-, two-, and three-dimensional cata- 
lyst support morphologies have demonstrated better mass transfer, 
catalyst dispersion, electron transfer, and thus better performance. 
This section summarizes the recent progress in preparing catalyst 
supports with new morphologies. 

4.4.1.1. One-dimensional  support.  Catalyst  supports  with  one- 
dimensional morphologies, such as NFs, NTs, and nanorods have 
demonstrated high performance in energy conversion/storage de- 
vices, owing to their high electrical conductivity (especially in case 
of  metal  oxides),  improved  mass  transfer  properties,  and  higher 
aspect ratio [286–288] . A NF morphology can be obtained using 
different methods, such as drawing [289–291] , template [292–294] , 
self-assembly [64,295,296] , and electrospinning [297–306] . Among 
these methods, electrospinning is the most common, owing to its 
simplicity, cost-effectiveness, high productivity, room-temperature 
operation, and applicability for a wide range of materials. 

Carbon nanoﬁber.  Metal-based catalysts supported on CNFs are 
usually prepared through the mixing of a transition metal(s) pre- 
cursor (usually acetate) with a low-thermal-stability polymer such 
as polyvinyl-alcohol (PVA) or PVP, followed by electrospinning, sta- 
bilization, and calcination under an inert atmosphere such as N 
2 
or  Ar.  During  this  process,  the  transition  metal  precursor  is  de- 
composed  into  metal  atoms  that  are  usually  embedded  in  the 
CNF, and the other part presents on the surface. The metal sur- 
face is usually covered by a thin carbon layer that acts as a pro- 
tective layer for the transition metal. Moreover, this carbon layer 
increases the adsorption of the fuel on its surface, improving the 
overall performance [180] . The doping of Ni/CNF alloyed with dif- 
ferent transition metals such as Cu [180] , Cd [307] , Mn [174] , Sn 
[308,309] ,  Co  [145,149] ,  and  Cr  [310]  resulted  in  high  oxidation 
activity toward low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons. For instance, 
alloying of Ni/CNF with different percentages of Co exhibited an 
increase in activity toward methanol until 50% Co, and then the 
activity decreased with further increases in the Co content [145] . 
Compared to NP catalysts, NF catalysts have demonstrated better 
performance,  owing  to  the  improved  electron  and  mass  transfer 
through the NF structure, especially at a high applied voltage (high 
reaction rate). As discussed in the alloying section, Co itself showed 
no catalytic activity toward methanol oxidation. Therefore, the per- 
formance decreased with further increases in the Co concentration 
beyond 50%. 

The  effects  of  different  supports  with  different  morphologies, 
i.e., graphene “Ni/Gr” ( Fig. 9 a), CNF “Ni/CNFs” ( Fig. 9 b), and carbon 
NPs “Ni/CNPs” ( Fig. 9 c), on the activity of Ni toward ethanol oxida- 
tion have been investigated [311] . It was found that changes in the 
support morphology resulted in changes in the optimum Ni load- 
ing on the surface, where the optimum Ni loadings were 6, 10, and 
60% for CNPs, CNFs, and Gr supports, respectively. Such increases in

the optimal Ni loading were related to the available support sur- 
face area. Interestingly, CNFs revealed a higher diffusion coeﬃcient 
compared to CNPs and Gr. However, at 10 wt% Ni, the peak cur- 
rent  density  and  peak  potential  were  53 mA  cm −2  at  0.75 V  (vs. 
Ag/AgCl), 28 mA cm −2 at 0.63 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), and 25 mA cm −2 at 
0.6 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), for Ni/CNFs, Ni/Gr, and Ni/NPs, respectively, us- 
ing 50 mV s −1 in 2 M ethanol in 1 M KOH solution. 

Importantly, using stable thermal polymers, such as PAN in an 
electrospinning  process,  remarkably  affected  the  position  of  the 
synthesized metal atoms on the CNF, such that all the metal atoms 
were on the surface of the CNF and none were embedded in the 
CNF.  However,  the  Ni  NPs  prepared  on  the  surface  of  the  CNF 
(NiO/CNF) revealed high methanol oxidation activity [263] , and the 
activity was further increased by the doping of nitrogen into the 
CNF supports (NiOs/N –CNF) [264,272] . The incorporation of 20 wt% 
of CNFs into mesoporous Ni 
2 NPs increased the surface area 
4 ) 
(84.3 m 2  g −1 vs. 19.0 m 2  g −1 ), ECSA (3.0 vs. 1.15 cm 2 ), and elec- 
trical conductivity, resulting in an increase in its activity toward 
ethanol oxidation (0.5 M NaOH containing 0.2 M EtOH), where the 
anodic peak potential increased 10 times, and the onset potential 
decreased  from  0.43  to  0.4  (vs.  Ag/AgCl)  [312] .  Table  5  summa- 
rizes the different studies using electrospinning in preparing non- 
precious catalysts for direct alcohol FC applications.

Carbon nanotubes.  CNTs are another class of one-dimensional 
supports  that  have  outstanding  electrical  and  mechanical  prop- 
erties,  and  they  are  effectively  used  in  various  applications,  in- 
cluding energy storage/conversion devices. CNTs are classiﬁed into 
two  main  categories:  single-walled  CNTs  (SWCNTs)  and  multi- 

walled CNTs (MWCNTs). CNTs are manufactured using several tech- 
niques, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [317,318] , arc dis- 
charge  [319,320] ,  and  laser  ablation  [321,322] .  Multiwalled  car- 
bon nanotubes (MWCNTs) have the merits of a highly graphitized 
wall, nanosized channel structure, and sp2-C-constructed surface 
[287,323] , which result in improving the electron and mass trans- 
fer [324] . Owing to their outstanding properties, CNTs are exten- 
sively used in FCs, including the preparation of nonprecious anodic 
catalysts that can be used for methanol, ethanol, and urea oxida- 
tion. 

CNTs have high electrical conductivity, and their morphology fa- 
cilitates the good dispersion of Ni NPs, resulting in the enhanced 
catalytic activity of Ni/MWCNT toward urea electrooxidation, com- 
pared to Ni/C. For example, the peak current of Ni/MWCNT was 
found  to  be  two  times  higher  than  that  of  Ni/C  using  0.33 M 
urea  dissolved  in  1 M  KOH  [102] .  Among  the  different  loadings 
of Ni over MWCNT support (Ni/MWCNT) prepared by the reduc- 
tion method, Ni/MWCNT with 80 wt% Ni achieved the highest urea 
oxidation  activity,  owing  to  the  good  dispersion  of  the  catalyst 
over the MWCNTs, which resulted in a high ECSA of the catalyst 
[324] . 

The incorporation of MWCNTs in nanoporous nickel phosphate 
resulted  in  increasing  its  activity  toward  ethanol  oxidation  [85] . 
The MWCNTs could increase the surface area, facilitate the elec- 
tron  transfer,  and  improve  the  mass  transfer  between  the  elec- 
trode and the anolyte [325–327] . The application of ZnO/MWCNTs 
as a support for the Ni–Cu alloy (Ni–Cu/ZnO@MWCNT) enhanced 
the  dispersion  of  the  catalyst  Ni–Cu  on  the  surface,  and  using

Although peak appeared at a voltage higher than 0.7 V, methanol oxidation is far from this value; therefore, this catalyst has a high anti-poisoning property, and the

current obtained would be related to the electrolysis of the fuel, not its oxidation. 

For 0.4 to 0.8 V, 0.1 M is best, whereas, for higher voltages, 2 M is best; therefore, 0.1 M is taken as optimal. 
No clear peak appeared, even at 1 M, with a very tiny slope at 0.6 V and a current density of 30 mA cm −2 
at 0.1 M methanol. 
Anodic peak potential did not appear, even at the potential of 1 V; therefore, this catalyst has a high anti-poisoning property. 

this catalyst in a DUFC yielded a power density of 26.9 mW cm −2 
at  20 °C,  which  increased  to  44.36 mW  cm −2  at  50 °C  ( Fig.  10 ) 
[125] . 

Jin  et  al.  reported  that  Ni  electrodeposited  on  the  surface  of 
MWCNTs, with and without the grafting of a 4-nitroaniline (NA) 
radical monolayer on the surface of the MWCNTs, yielded high ac- 
tivity toward ethanol oxidation in 0.1 M NaOH [328] . In other study, 
Deng et al. investigated the effect of the incorporation of MWCNTs 
(15, 25, 35, and 45 wt%) into NiCo/C–N (fabricated by the direct py- 
rolysis of a Ni–Co salt/polyaniline (PANI) composite at 800 °C un- 
2 atmosphere), on methanol and ethanol oxidation activi- 
der a N 
ties [329] . The results showed that the oxidation activities toward 
methanol (1 M) and ethanol (1 M) are signiﬁcantly increased with 
increasing MWCNT content to 35 wt%, whereas they decreased at 

higher MWCNT percentages. The addition of the MWCNTs (up to 
35 wt.%) augmented the charge transfer between the catalyst and 
solution,  as  well  as  improving  the  dispersion  of  the  Ni  catalyst, 
whereas a further increase in the CNTs (to 45 wt.%) decreased the 
active catalyst sites (Ni NPs), thereby reducing the catalytic activity 
[329] . The modiﬁcation of GC with CNTs to be used as a support 
for a ternary alloy of CuCoNi (prepared by electrodeposition) im- 
proved the catalyst activity toward methanol oxidation [186] . The 
activities of different Ni-based catalysts using CNTs as support are 
summarized in Table 6 .

thick) bonded together in a honeycomb crystal lattice (hexagonal 
lattice) [331,332] . Gr has shown promising properties, such as high 
crystal quality, excellent mechanical properties (Young’s modulus 
~1.1  TPa  and  fracture  strength  of  0.125  TPa)  [333] ,  high  thermal 
conductivity (~5 kW m −1  K −1 ) [334] , good electrical conductivity 
(based on the preparation methods) [335] , high intrinsic mobility 
(2 × 10 5  cm 2  v −1  s −1 ), high optical transmittance (~97.7%), and a 
large  theoretical  speciﬁc  surface  area  (2630  m 2  g −1 )  [336–338] . 
The  high  surface  area  of  Gr  (2630  m 2  g −1 ),  its  high  conductiv- 
ity,  and  ability  to  facilitate  electron  transfer  through  itself  make 
the Gr and its derivatives promising electrode materials for elec- 
trocatalytic applications in energy devices such as FCs [339] . Gr is 
widely used as a support for precious catalysts in different low- 
temperature FCs [340–343] , or even as a standalone catalyst at the 
cathode [344–347] . This section focuses on the application of Gr 
as a support for the non-precious catalyst for methanol, ethanol, 
and  urea.  Pure  Ni  catalysts  have  the  disadvantages  of  easy  CO- 
poisoning as well as low electroactive sites [348–350] . Therefore, 
three different forms of Ni (Ni, Ni alloys, and Ni hydroxide/oxides) 
were  supported  onto  Gr  to  enhance  its  catalytic  activity  and  its 
anti-poisoning  property.  For  example,  a  one-pot  electroreduction 
process of graphene oxide (GO) with Ni ions successfully produced 
a reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-supported Ni [351] . The fabricated 
rGO-Ni nanocomposites improved the electrochemical performance 
and  enhanced  the  current  density.  Nickel–molybdenum  incorpo- 
rated into graphene (Ni–Mo/Gr) and used for alkaline urea elec- 
trooxidation [349] . However, by investigating the structure-activity 
1 /Gr, they found 
relationships and electrocatalytic kinetics of Ni 
that the electrocatalytic activity and stability were affected by the 
structural  and  electronic  effects.  Ni  supported  on  rGO  (Ni/rGO), 
prepared by the electrochemical reduction of Ni on the surface of 
a GC electrode precoated with GO, demonstrated high urea oxida- 
tion activity compared to that of Ni NPs (with a two-fold higher 
current density at 0.6 V vs. Hg/HgO). The high activity was related 
to the large active surface areas of the Gr sheets, which can pro- 
mote electron transfer of urea oxidation [351] . Ni/rGO prepared by 
reﬂuxing a mixture of nickel acetate (NiAc) and GO at 120 °C for 
10 h, followed by calcination under an inert atmosphere 850 °C, ex- 
hibited high urea oxidation activity compared to the Ni NPs. More- 
over,  the  activity  increased  as  the  initial  wt%  of  NiAc  to  GO  in- 
creased to 100 wt%, but it decreased as the initial NiAc content 
increased further to 150 wt%. At low NiAc (25 wt.%), the available 
Ni NPs over the Gr sheet were few, and thus performance was low. 

2 Mo 

On the contrary, at high NiAc (150 wt%), Ni covered the whole sur- 
face of the Gr, which obstructed the adsorption of urea molecules, 
and thus the performance decreased [352] . Glass et al. [353] di- 
rectly reduced nickel chloride in a GO aqueous solution followed 
by annealing at different temperatures (30 0–70 0 °C) for urea elec- 
trooxidation ( Fig. 11 ). They found that the GO support affected the 
Ni NPs, where the reduction of Ni directly onto the GO yielded a 
smaller particle size and improved the urea oxidation, compared 
to the plain Ni catalyst. Ni/rGO annealed at 300 °C enhanced the 
urea oxidation current, and a more favorable onset potential was 
observed,  compared  to  that  of  the  bare  Ni  catalyst.  These  cata- 
lysts were examined in a micro direct urea/hydrogen peroxide FC. 
The OCV of the examined cells were 0.21, 0.26, 0.36, and 0.33 for 
Ni, Ni/rGO, Ni/rGO-300, and Ni/rGO-700, respectively ( Fig. 11 ). The 
annealing  of  the  catalyst  was  shown  to  increase  the  OCV  com- 
pared to the nonannealed and bare nickel catalysts. However, the 
Ni/rGO-700 sample displayed a slightly lower OCV compared to the 
Ni/rGO-300, which was related to the partial oxidation of the Ni 
with the GO at high temperature [353] . 

Ni  prepared  on  the  surface  of  Gr,  followed  by  calcination  at 
850 °C under an argon atmosphere ( Fig. 12 a), revealed high activ- 
ity  toward  methanol  oxidation  compared  to  that  of  Ni  NPs  ( Fig. 
12 b). The activity was further increased by incorporating Co ( Fig. 
12 c). The high activity with Gr was related to the outstanding con- 
ductivity and adsorption capacity of the Gr support, as well as the 
effect of Co [354] . 

In  addition  to  the  superior  performance  of  Gr,  adding  nitro- 
gen to the Gr structure (N-rGO) improves its electrical properties, 
where N-rGO is an n-type dopant that acts as a source of elec- 
trons [355] . The N-rGO support, synthesized by an electrochem- 
ical  method  using  urea  choline  chloride  and  urea  as  the  reduc- 
ing and doping agents, exhibited high activity toward ethanol ox- 
idation,  owing  to  the  role  of  nitrogen  as  well  as  the  high  sur- 
face  area  and  high  electrical  conductivity  of  graphene  [356] .  Ni 
NPs  decorated  on  Gr,  synthesized  by  a  one-step  process  using 
commercial  sugar  and  different  concentrations  of  NiAc  (0,  1,  2, 
3,  4,  and  5  wt%),  exhibited  higher  activities  toward  urea  oxida- 
tion compared with unsupported Ni NPs. Importantly, the use of 
very low or very high concentrations of the Ni precursor (NiAc) 
resulted in decreasing the active surface area: at lower NiAc con- 
tent,  there  was  a  Ni  deﬁciency,  whereas,  at  higher  percentages, 
4 -rGO,  fabricated  by 
the  Ni  particle  size  increased  [357] .  NiCo

Overall, the enhanced electrocatalytic activity of Gr-supported 
catalysts for methanol, ethanol, and urea is attributed to the mi- 
crostructure of Gr (defects and functional groups) and the interac- 
tion of single or multi-catalysts with Gr. Furthermore, it was sug- 
gested that the functional groups on the Gr surface may act as an- 
choring sites for the catalyst precursor, preventing the catalyst ag- 
gregation and resulting in an increase in the surface area and the 
catalyst distribution on the surface [360] . 

4.4.1.3. Three-dimensional support.  A highly porous carbon sponge, 
prepared  by  a  template  method,  supporting  Ni  exhibited  high 
urea  oxidation  activity  (30 mV  decrease  in  the  onset  poten- 
tial,  and  eight  times  higher  anodic  current  density),  owing  to 
the  signiﬁcant  increase  in  the  ECSA  [62] .  Through  the  hy- 
drothermal  reduction  of  GO  and  Ni  ions,  a  magnetic,  porous, 
and  lightweight  three-dimensional  (3D)  freestanding  Ni  NPs/Gr 
aerogel  was  successfully  fabricated  ( Fig.  13 (a–c))  [361] .  The  3D 
composite  architecture  exhibited  excellent  electrocatalytic  activ- 
ity  and  high  stability  for  ethanol  electro-oxidation  in  an  alka- 
line  electrolyte  compared  to  that  in  the  case  of  Ni/MWCNTs 
( Fig. 13 (d and e)). 

The 3D Gr aerogel provided a good dispersion of the Ni NPs, 
in  addition  to  the  high  conductivity  of  the  Gr  and  the  superior 
porosity  of  the  Gr  aerogel,  thereby  facilitating  the  mass  transfer 
to the active sites [361] . However, the incorporation of PVA dur- 
ing the preparation of the Gr aerogels resulted in increasing the 
chemical and mechanical stabilities of the aerogels ( Fig. 14 ( a–d)) 
[193] . The addition of Fe ions increased the number of pores in 
the Gr aerogels, resulting in an increase in the ECSA (from 30 to 
70.8 m 2 g −1 ), in addition to the bifunctional catalyst activity of Ni 
and Fe. As a result, the addition of iron ions reduced the onset po- 
tential by 51 mV and improved the current density (170% at 0.5 V 
(vs. Ag/AgCl)) [193] . The improved activity was also related to the 
3 -induced gelation of the GO layers 
porous network  of NiO–Fe 
[197,362] .

Three-dimensional  NiCu/rGO  foam  is  prepared  by  a  self- 
propagated  combustion  method  [363] .  The  addition  of  rGO  in- 
40 /rGO 
creases  the  porosity  of  the  foam.  However,  the  Cu 
demonstrated high methanol oxidation activity (1 M methanol in 

60 Ni 

60 Ni 

1 M KOH), compared to that prepared without rGO, i.e., Cu 
40 . 
The  existence  of  CuO  (110)  is  important  for  the  oxidation  of 
methanol without forming CO intermediates [364] , where it pro- 
moted the oxidation of methanol into formaldehyde without form- 
ing the CO-poisoning intermediates [365] , the foam also showed 
high CO oxidation activity via the direct oxidation of CO without 
being adsorbed [366] . A 3D porous electrode of Ni/CNT supported 
on the surface of a porous sponge (Ni/CNT@Sponge) was investi- 
gated under actual FC operation showing, 3.9 mW cm −2 using 3 M 
urea [367] . 

Additionally,  El-Deeb  et  al.  reported  that  a  nanoneedle struc- 
ture  of  nickel  cobaltite  on  the  surface  of  carbon  aerogel  (hy- 
drothermally  prepared)  exhibited  high  methanol  oxidation  activ- 
ity  compared  to  that  of  an  unsupported  one.  The  high  activity 
was  related  to  the  synergetic  effects  between  the  pore  geome- 
try  and  porosity  of  the  carbon  aerogel  [368] .  Moreover,  highly 
porous Ni-Co/MWCNTs aerogels demonstrated a superior urea ox- 
idation  activity  owing  to  the  synergetic  effect  of  the  porous 
support  and  the  alloying  effect  [369] .  The  activities  of  differ- 
ent  Ni-based  catalysts  using  Gr  as  a  support  are  summarized 
in Table 7 . 

4.4.2. Ni-based catalysts with new morphologies 

In  the  previous  section,  the  Ni-based  catalysts  had  a  zero- 
dimensional morphology, i.e., NPs, and the supports had different 
morphologies, i.e., one-, two-, and three-dimensional. This section 
aims to summarize the different morphologies of Ni-based cata- 
lysts, rather than the zero-dimensional ones, that are used to in- 
crease the catalyst activity. 

4.4.2.1. One-dimensional catalyst.  The preparation of NiO in the NF 
morphology using electrospinning signiﬁcantly improved its activ- 
ity toward methanol oxidation, where the current generated from 
methanol oxidation is 7.5 mA cm −2 , which is three times greater 
than that obtained in the case of Ni NPs at 1 M methanol and 0.5 V 
(vs. Ag/AgCl) ( Fig. 15 a) [313] . Although the NF morphology did not 
affect the onset potential (0.35 V), a higher optimum methanol of 
1 M is obtained compared to 0.1 M for the Ni NPs ( Fig. 15 a), which 
was associated with the ease of mass transfer and electron transfer 
in the NF compared to the NPs ( Fig. 15 b). 

One-dimensional Ni nanowire arrays (Ni NWA) were success- 
fully produced through electrodeposition on the surface of a poly- 
carbonate template [64,372] . The Ni NWA signiﬁcantly enhanced

the ECSA by 8.57 times compared with bare Ni sheet [372] . Com- 
pared  to  the  Ni  bare  sheet,  the  NWA  structure  of  Ni  demon- 
strated  higher  and  more  stable  activities  toward  urea,  hydrogen 
peroxide, and urea peroxide oxidation. Apart from the high ECSA 
of  the  NWA,  it  also  exhibited  better  mass  and  charge  transfer 
[372] . Nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) template is con- 
sidered as an effective method for preparing one-, two- and three- 
dimensional  nanostructures  [373] .  Yan  et  al.  [374]  prepared  Ni 
NWA  by  electrodeposition  on  AAO  template,  that  demonstrated 
high urea oxidation activity due to their high surface area of pre- 
pared Ni NWA. The incorporation of Co in the Ni NWA, i.e., Ni–
Co NWA signiﬁcantly improved its activity toward urea oxidation, 
where using 10% Co (Ni 9) decreased the onset potential to 0.19 V 

vs. SCE, and the current density increased to 380 mA cm −2 at 0.6 V 
vs. SCE. The NiCo NWA showed a considerably high power output 
(7.4 mW cm −2 at 25 °C using 0.33 M urea), and stability under ac- 
tual DUFC operation.

oxidation activity, compared with NiO and Co 
4 nanopowders, in 
terms  of  current  density  and  onset  potential,  owing  to  the  high 
surface area of the porous NF structure [375] . A core/shell struc- 
ture of Cu/NiCu NWs exhibited higher methanol oxidation activity 
compared with Cu NW or NiCu NPs ( Fig. 16 ) [142] . This could be 
attributed to the fast charges in the Cu NW that act as a source of

electrons to the active NiCu alloy shell, as well as the synergetic of 
NiCu [182–184] . 

Owing to the hollow structure of nanotubes (NT), they had a 
higher surface area than that of NF and NW, and thus, some re- 
searchers preferred preparing the catalyst in the NT form. Muench 
et  al.  found  that  the  activity  of  unsupported  Ni  NT,  prepared 
by electroless plating on the surface of an ion-track-etched poly- 

mer template ( Fig. 17 a) [253] , toward ethanol oxidation is higher 
than  that  of  Ni  NW.  The  current  density  at  0.6 V  (vs.  Ag/AgCl) 
for  Ni  NT  was  14.8 mA  cm −2  compared  to  2.18 mA  cm −2  for  Ni 
NW, using 0.5 M ethanol in 0.1 M NaOH at 50 mV s −1  ( Fig. 17 b). 
This  improvement  with  the  Ni  NT  was  ascribed  to  its  high  sur- 
face  area  and  the  easy  transfer  of  the  electrolyte  ions  to  the 
active  sites  [253] .  Moreover,  the  doping  with  B  resulted  in  a

active  sites,  easy  accessibility  of  electrolyte  ions  to  the  active 
sites,  and  thus  higher  activity  [377–380] .  NiOOH  NS  were  pre- 
pared  via  a  hydrothermal  method  using  PVP  as  a  surfactant 

template  and  shape-directing  agent  [381] .  The  NiOOH  NS  were 
subsequently transferred by adsorption on the surface of electro- 
chemically pretreated glassy carbon electrode (EPGC). The CVs of 
the NiOOH/EPGC in 0.1 M NaOH exhibited the successful transfer 
of the NiOOH and the linear increase in the anodic and cathodic 
peak  potential  with  increasing  the  scan  rate,  indicating  that  the 
electron  transfer  for  NiOOH  occurs  through  a  surface-controlled 
mechanism  [382] .  The  prepared  electrode  demonstrated  the  ac- 
tivity  for  methanol  and  glucose  oxidation.  The  performance  of 
NiOOH/EPGC  was  signiﬁcantly  higher  than  that  in  the  case  of

4.4.2.3. Three-dimensional  catalyst.  Soliman  et  al.  [384]  demon- 
strated that the morphology and the activity of Ni NPs, prepared 
by electrodeposition, are affected by the acidity of the bath solu- 
tion, i.e., using a pH of 0.8 or 5.5 for NiSO 
4 solution. A spherulite- 
like particle was obtained in the acidic condition (pH of 5.5), and 
in the strong acidic condition (pH 0.8), a smooth and bald island 
was formed. Such a spherulite-like structure of the catalyst granted 
a higher surface area and better mass transfer. Three-dimensional 
urchin-like spinels Co 
4 , 
4 , Ni 
0.67 O of 4 μm diameter were prepared by the 
and cubic Co 
hydrothermal method ( Fig. 18 (a–f)). Although all the catalysts had 
the same urchin-like structure, the Ni 
4 catalyst exhibited the 
highest surface area, a mesoporous structure, and narrow pore-size 
distribution. As a result, Ni 
4 exhibited the best performance 
toward methanol oxidation, and the lowest activity was obtained 
for the Ni-free sample, i.e., Co 
4 , ( Fig. 18 (g and h)) [385] . Similar 
results were reported by Prathap et al. [210] .

By  controlling  the  hydrothermal  treatment  time,  three  differ- 
4 microspheres were obtained ( Fig. 19 ) 
ent morphologies of NiCo 
[386] . Initially, hydrothermal treatment for 4 h resulted in a for- 
mation of ﬂower-like hierarchical structures (NCO-ﬂower-like HSs), 
which  changed  to  nanoﬂake@nanoneedle-like  multiple  hierarchi- 
cal structures (NCO-MHS) when the time increased to 6 h; a fur- 
ther increase in the time (8 h) altered the structures to urchin-like 
hierarchical structures (NCO-urchin-like HSs) [387,388] . The NCO- 
MHS  had  the  largest  surface  area  of  69.7  m 2  g −1 ,  compared  to 
59.4 m 2  g −1  for NCO-ﬂower-like HSs and 63.2 m 2  g −1  for NCO- 
urchin-like HSs. As a result, the NCO-MHS exhibited the best ac- 
tivity toward methanol oxidation with an onset poetical of 0.42 V 
vs. Hg/HgO. The activity of the NiCo 
4 , especially NCO-MHS, is 
related to the high surface area, the presence of mixed-valence ox- 
ides that could produce two different active sites for methanol oxi- 
dation, and the mesoporous structure that acts as channels for ions 
and mass transfer to the reaction sites [158] . For the same reasons, 
hollow  spheres  and  nanocups  of  Ni(OH) 
2  monolayers  [389]  and 
hollow sodium nickel ﬂuoride (SNF) nanocubes deposited on the 
surface of MWCNTs showed high urea oxidation activity [330] , and 
the mesoporous nanoﬂower NiO [390] and nanospheres of NiCo 
2 O 
4 
exhibited high methanol oxidation [391] .

Through controlling the P and/or Ni precursors, Song et al. pre- 
pared  different  morphologies  and  crystal  structures  of  Ni  phos- 
phate (NiPO), i.e., nanotubes (NiPO-a), ﬂower-like (NiPO-b, -c), and 
stacked nanocrystals (NiPO-d) ( Fig. 20 a) [392] . Among the different 
prepared materials, NiPO-c with ﬂower-like structure displayed the 

best activity toward urea oxidation and the best stability with only 
5% loss of performance, whether after 96 h of current discharge or 
after storing in urea solution for 134 days ( Fig. 20 b and c). 

In another study, urchin-like Ni and/or Co phosphides and/or 
phosphates  with  different  molar  ratios  of  Co  to  Ni  salts  (0.053 
(NiCoP-1), 0.018 (NiCoP-2), 0.33 (NiCoP-3), and 1 (NiCoP-4)) were 
prepared. NiCoP-2 showed the highest surface area with a meso- 
pore volume of 540.5 m 2  g −1  [207] . Additionally, urchin-like Ni- 
P microspheres, prepared by a solvothermal method, showed high 
urea oxidation activity, not only with a signiﬁcant increase in the 
surface area of the urchin-like structure microspheres compared to 
Ni NPs (75% increase in ECSA), but also with an improved electron 
transfer with P, and the easy removal of the intermediates [240] . 
The effect of catalyst morphology on the activities of different Ni- 
based catalysts are summarized in Table 8 . 

5. Crystalline porous materials 

2 and AlO 

Zeolites and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous crys- 
talline  materials  that  have  demonstrated  signiﬁcant  catalytic  ac- 
tivities  in  different  applications  [403–405] .  Zeolites  are  built  of 
4 structures while MOFs are composed of 
tetrahedral SiO 
metallic atoms connected by an organic linker. While zeolites are 
considered microporous materials, that is, their pore sizes are be- 
low 2 nm (and often even below 1 nm), MOFs are considered meso- 
porous solid materials because they have pore sizes between 2 and 
50 nm. The mesoporous structure of MOFs is preferred (compared 
to  that  of  zeolites)  because  it  offers  advantages  from  the  high- 
surface-area- and mass-transfer points of views. However, the or- 
ganic linkers used in MOFs are not suitable for stable operation 
under harsh conditions [406] . 

5.1. Zeolites 

Recently, considerable attention has been paid to zeolites as an 
alternative  catalyst  to  accelerate  the  fuel  oxidation  in  FCs  [407–
409] . The term zeolite was coined in 1756 by a Swedish mineralo- 
gist, who observed the rapid evaporation rate of water, which was 
absorbed by this material under high temperature. Based on this, 
the material was named as zeolites, referring to the Greek (zeo), 
meaning "to boil" and (lithes), meaning "stone" [410,411] . Zeolite 
materials have a microporous crystalline structure of aluminosil- 
icate  (Al,  Si)  coupled  with  an  oxygen  bond  O-linked  tetrahedral 
structure (TO 
4 ), where each apical oxygen atom is shared with an 
adjacent  tetrahedron.  When  tetrahedra  containing  Si 4 +  and  Al 3 + 
are connected to form a 3D zeolite framework, there is a nega- 
tive charge associated with each Al 3 +  atom. The negative frame- 
work charge is balanced by an exchangeable cation, yielding elec- 
trical neutrality, as shown in Figure 21 [412–414] . The multitude 
of  possibilities  of  these  tetrahedra  together  supports  the  zeolite 
family  with  various  structures  of  respect  to  the  units,  size,  and

dimensionality of the channel system [415] . The regular microp- 
ore dimension and uniform shape of zeolite structures allow them 
to act as molecular sieves to select the speciﬁc molecules passing 
through it, depending on their size and shape; this phenomenon 
is  known  as  “shape  selectivity” [416–418] .  The  advantage  of  us- 
ing zeolites material as a support-selective catalyst is the ability to 
enhance the kinetic reaction on the surface of the electrode ma- 
terials, especially in the case of a direct methanol FC (DMFC). In 
such a FC, Bronsted acidity along with the surface Si-OH groups, 
present in meso Zeolites, facilitate the adsorption of methanol and 
OH −, which in turn accelerates the overall kinetics of the methanol 
oxidation  reaction.  Overall,  the  excellent  selectivity,  long-term 
stability,  large  micropore  volume  and  high  speciﬁc  surface  area 
of  zeolite  materials  make  them  particularly  interesting  as  ion- 
exchange resins, adsorbent materials, and selective catalysts of FCs 
[419–421] . 

5.1.1. Zeolite preparation and modiﬁcation 

There  are  different  methods  for  zeolite  preparation,  such  as 
hydrothermal,  sol–gel,  thermal  decomposition,  and  ion-exchange 
methods  [423–426] .  The  application of  zeolites  as  an  alternative 
catalyst  for  FCs  is  considered  a  promising  solution  to  overcome 
the  drawbacks  of  Pt,  such  as  high  cost  and  surface  blocking  by 
the  adsorbed  carbonaceous  substances  [67] .  Another  aspect  that 
makes zeolites attractive catalyst materials for FCs is the short dif- 
fusion path, such that the active sites are more readily accessible 
[427,428] . Despite all the mentioned advantages of zeolite mate- 
rials, their low electrical conductivity is still the major challenge 

that reduces their catalytic activity for fuel oxidation [429] . Many 
effort s have been exerted to modify the catalytic activity and fur- 
ther  properties  of  zeolite  electrodes  using  different  modiﬁcation 
techniques [430–434] , such as oxygen plasma treatment [435] , acid 
treatment [434] , and metal-ion exchange techniques [436] . Among 
those techniques, the ion exchange process is considered the most 
common, cost-effective, and simple method to modify the zeolite 
structure by metal-ion incorporation [431] . The zeolite is kept im- 
mersed in the solution of a metal salt for several hours to allow 
metal ions to replace zeolite cations [437] . Moreover, incorporation 
of metal ions into a zeolite framework can also be performed by 
the immersion method [438] , stirring method [439] , and sodium 
borohydride reduction method [426] . 

5.1.2. Zeolite-modiﬁed electrodes in methanol, ethanol, and urea 
oxidations 

Generally, zeolite materials are known as heterogeneous cata- 
lysts that catalyze hydrocarbon-cracking, methanol conversion, or 
disproportionation  and  alkylation  of  aromatics.  Moreover,  many 
researchers  have  investigated  the  metal  zeolite-modiﬁed  elec- 
trodes  (ZME)  as  an  effective  electrocatalyst  for  several  applica- 
tions [415,4 40–4 42] . Pang et al. investigated both ZME and ZME/ 
Pt  as  electrocatalysts  of  direct  ethanol  fuel  cell,  and  the  results 
showed that  zeolite  enhances the  long-term  stability of  Pt  cata- 
lyst during the electrooxidation process of alcohol [426] . Moreover, 
Samant et al. [443] studied the catalytic behavior of ZME/carbon, 
Pt/carbon, and Pt/ ZME/carbon as catalyst materials on the anodic 
electrooxidation of methanol in acidic conditions. The obtained re-

sults  showed  that  Pt/ZME/Carbon  achieved  the  highest  catalytic 
performance,  followed  by  ZME/carbon  and  ﬁnally,  the  Pt/Carbon 
catalyst material. This enhancement in the electrocatalytic perfor- 
mance is due to the formation of speciﬁc CO clusters in the ZME 
sieve framework [443] . The ZME coupled with iron ions (Fe/ZME) 
showed eﬃcient performance toward methanol oxidation in an al- 
kaline medium [4 4 4] , because of the enhancement in the electron 
transfer rate and decrease in the over-potential for methanol oxi- 
dation. 

The  effect  of  the  methodology  used  for  the  synthesis  of 
ZME anodic electrocatalysts was reported for both methanol and 
ethanol FCs by Ramirez et al. [445] . Pt NPs was successfully sup- 
ported  with  faujasite  zeolite/carbon-modiﬁed  electrode  (FAU-C), 
prepared by a sol–gel (Pt-FAU-C SG) and/or hydrothermal (Pt-FAU- 
C HT) process, and they were used for electrocatalyst applications 
in alcohol FCs. The Pt-FAU-C SG showed the highest current den- 
sity  for  methanol  and  ethanol  oxidation,  compared  to  Pt-  FAU- 
C  HT,  and  Pt/C.  These  results  highlighted  the  importance  of  the 
ZME preparation method and its effect on the material structure, 
morphology, and electrocatalytic behavior [445] . Moreover, based 
on  the  physisorption  analysis,  the  microporosity  of  Pt-FAU-C  SG 
was lower than that exhibited in the case of Pt-FAU-C HT. Thus, 
the electrocatalyst Pt-FAU-C SG presents a higher load of Pt, and 
as a result, a higher electrocatalytic activity toward methanol and 
ethanol oxidation reaction, compared to a Pt/C electrode. The re- 
sults  obtained  by  the  above  studies  conﬁrmed  the  great  ability 
of  ZME  toward  methanol  and  ethanol  oxidation,  compared  with 
carbon-based  electrodes.  This  high  performance  is  attributed  to 

the  protonic  entities  on  the  ZME  surface,  which  makes  it  more 
hydrophilic than carbon, resulting in a decrease in the ohmic re- 
sistance and enhanced anodic generated current, compared with 
carbon-based electrodes. 

Hassaninejad-Darzi  et  al.  [85]  coupled  a  nanoporous  nickel 
phosphate molecular sieve (NP) with MWCNTs in a CPE electrode; 
however, the electrode showed activity in NaOH only after Ni de- 
position on it. Ni-MWCNT-NP/CPE showed higher activity than Ni- 
CPE in 0.1 M NaOH with and without 0.001 M EtOH. The superior 
Ni-MWCNT-NP/CPE performance was a result of MWCNT and NP 
addition.  MWCNT  enhanced  the  electrical  conductivity,  chemical 
stability, electron transfer rate, surface area, and electron transfer 
between the electrode and analyte, while NP introduced pores and 
channels, facilitating Ni 2+ diffusion into it [85] . Table 9 summarizes 
the performances of zeolite-based nonprecious catalysts. 

5.2. Metal-organic frameworks 

MOFs,  also  known  as  porous  coordination  polymers  (PCPs), 
are microporous crystalline materials, which have become a very 
strong  ﬁeld  of  research  over  the  last  15  years  [449] .  The  main 
structure of MOFs consist of organic ligands, also known as sec- 
ondary  building  units  (SBUs),  and  metal  nodes,  which  combine 
to form structures ranging from the microporous to mesoporous 
scale [450,451] . The combination of the metal clusters and the or- 
ganic  linkers  possess  many  desirable  characteristics  for  applica- 
tions as heterogeneous catalysts to promote a wide range of ox- 
idation reactions [452] . The interest in MOFs for catalysis derives

from  several  unique  features  of  these  materials,  including  high 
metal content, high surface area, porosity, and structural stability 
[453,454] . 

Additionally,  MOFs  are  unique  in  that  their  surface  proper- 
ties can be easily modiﬁed and manipulated through the organic 
ligands;  therefore,  they  are  very  ﬂexible  for  synthesis  [455,456] . 
The  optical,  electrical,  and  magnetic  properties  of  MOFs  extend 
their applications to different applications such as separation pro- 
cesses [457] , gas storage [455] , and catalyst materials for electro- 
chemical devices, especially low-temperature FCs [68–70] . Among 
those ﬁelds, MOFs show promising catalytic activities for oxidation 
reactions  in  FCs  with  all  fuel  types,  such  as  ethanol,  methanol, 
and urea oxidation reactions, owing to the abovementioned unique 
characteristics, in addition to hydrogenation reactions, Knoevenagel 
condensations, ring opening of epoxides, and epoxidation of oleﬁns 
[458] . The pore and channel of MOFs offer radius and volume ex- 
clusion for targets with different size, shape, polarity, and confor- 
mation [459] . 

5.2.1. Design methods of MOFs 

The  electrochemical  activity  of  MOFs  can  be  achieved  by  in- 
troducing  a redox-active part or  combining the  catalytic  sites of 
metal particles [460] . The incorporation of redox-active organic lig- 
ands  represents  a  strategy  to  prepare  ra-MOFs  by  taking  advan- 
tage  of  the  ligand π –π ∗ bands  [461–463] .  The  extension  of  the 
conjugated  system  of  the  ligand  is  a  potential  approach  for  the 
construction of ra-MOFs, such as the derivatives of benzene, pyri- 
dine,  imidazole,  and  thiophene.  The  large  dislocation  area  facili- 
tates  UV  absorption,  luminescent  emission,  and  charge  mobility, 
which are important information sources monitored by chemical 
sensors.  The  long-lived  excited  state  is  stabilized  by  charge  de- 
localization via extensive π –π ∗ and/or π –n stacking interactions 
[461,462,464] .  Another  method  for  the  preparation  of  the  activ- 
ity of MOFs for electrochemical applications is using redox-active 
metal complexes as active sites of MOFs. The use of metal com- 
plexes, made from stable ligands, provides MOFs with the prop- 
erties of the metal ions and its electron atmosphere, polarization, 
and stereo speciﬁcity, as well as higher redox activity and catalytic

capacity  [465] .  Also,  the  pore  and  channel  of  MOFs  offer  radius 
and  volume  exclusion  for  targets  with  different  size,  shape,  po- 
larity, and conformation [459] . The host-guest interaction further 
enhances the selectivity by Lewis acidic or basic sites in ligands, 
open metal sites, hydrophobic interactions, and aromatic π groups 
in MOFs [466] . Moreover, the incorporation of electron-donating or 
electron-withdrawing groups in the ligands results in the forma- 
tion of donor-acceptor structures in the MOFs, and thus tunes elec- 
tron orbital energy level of electrochemical devices. The substrate 
speciﬁcity of the catalytic site improves the selectivity of electro- 
chemical response [467] . Moreover, the active sites introduced by 
the active species provide an eﬃcient energy and electron transfer 
between those sites and redox reactions for a fast electrochemi- 
cal response [462] . Furthermore, the integration of NPs in MOFs 
has been applied for enhanced electrochemical applications. In this 
case, the MOFs would act as a support and template for the con- 
trol of the size and shape of the nanoparticles [20] . To date, several 
examples of the incorporation of NPs into the cavities of MOF sys- 
tems have been reported in this ﬁeld [468,469] . The preparation 
of such materials was achieved through a broad range of synthetic 
methods, for example, solvent-free gas-phase loading of MOFs with 
volatile organo-metallic precursors, which are very commonly ap- 
plied for CVD [468] . Thermal or photochemical decomposition of 
the inﬁltrated precursors under a reactive or inert gas atmosphere 
leads to the formation of the desired NPs. Other loading methods 
that have been applied include liquid and incipient wetness im- 
pregnation, solid grinding, or encapsulation of preformed nanopar- 
ticles.  Owing  to  this  interaction,  an  enhanced  catalytic  property 
can  be  achieved  in  addition  to  the  formation  of  monodispersed 
metal-oxide nanocrystals, providing the possibility of developing a 
novel class heterogeneous catalysts. 

5.2.2. Applications 

There are many different applications of MOFs in electrochem- 
ical  FCs.  The  use  of  MOF-modiﬁed  electrodes  for  the  electrocat- 
2  has a great potential to decrease the ad- 
alytic reduction of CO 
2 on the environment by converting it to use- 
verse impacts of CO 
ful organic molecules [470] . As a catalyst for ethanol electrooxida- 

4 ) 

2 H 

tion, the [(HOC 
2  Cu(II)] MOF was used, and higher tolerance 
to oxidation, as well as lower over-potential, was observed, com- 
pared to Pt-based catalysts [472] . Furthermore, MOF was success- 
fully used in separation and puriﬁcation processes [473] . Wang et 
al. [474] investigated a pomegranate Ni/C as an active redox site on 
a MOF template to be used as an electrocatalyst for urea oxidation. 
The  results  exhibited  a  signiﬁcant  increase in  the  produced  cur- 
rent density, compared with commercial Pt/C as an anode catalyst 
under the same conditions [474] . They followed a method of intro- 
ducing Zn into Ni/C-MOF to form a higher surface area, owing to 
the evaporation of Zn during calcination, which leaves behind huge 
pores and open channels. These properties make the produced cat- 
alyst  achieve  high  activity  toward  oxidation  reaction  with  a  low 
over-potential of 40 mV and current density of 10 mA cm −2 , in ad- 
dition to its high UOR activity at the onset potential of 1.33 V vs. 
RHE. Tran et al. [475] also prepared amorphous and highly meso- 
porous  Ni-MOF  microspheres  using  a  hydrothermal  method.  An 
electrode with an active area of 0.25 cm 2 was prepared out of the 
material and MWCNT on ITO glass. It showed superior activity to- 
ward urea electrooxidation compared with MWCNT and Ni-MOF in 
0.1 M KOH with 13.9 mA/cm 2 peak current vs. 5.9 and 1.4 mA/cm 2 
for  Ni-MOF  and  MWCNT,  respectively,  in  10 mM  urea.  At  0.45 V, 
stability was achieved in only 10 s, and the current was 100% re- 
tained even after 30 days of storage [475] . Meanwhile, Zhu et al. 
studied  a  2D  MOF  NS  for  the  electrocatalytic  oxidation  of  urea. 
The reason for the use of a 2D shape instead of the more com- 
mon 3D morphology is that more metal active sites would be ex- 
posed by the ultrathin NSs for the catalytic reaction, and the open 
pores  between  ﬂexible  NSs  would  promote  the  mass  transfer  of 
the electrolyte and the diffusion of gas products [20] . The fabri- 
cated 2D Ni-MOF exhibited a current density of 10 mA cm −2 at a 
required potential of 1.36 V. Furthermore, Yang et al. have studied 
MOFs as an electrocatalyst for ethanol oxidation [472] . The ethanol 
sorption properties were tested ﬁrst for [(HOC 
2 dtoaCu], and it 
was found that it absorbs 0.8 mol of ethanol per 1.0 mol of the tar- 
get compound, showing very strong interaction with ethanol that 
would facilitate the electrooxidation. By CV observations, the ad- 
dition of ethanol showed considerable enhancement in the oxida-

tive current density, demonstrating that the ethanol electrooxida- 
tion on the tested MOF material is dependent on the concentra- 
tion of ethanol [472] . Wu et al. studied a nickel–organic framework 
(NiOF),  prepared  by  solvothermal  synthesis  using  nickel  chloride 
and benzene dicarboxylic acid precursors, as an anode catalyst for 
the electrooxidation of urea. The results showed the capability of 
enhancing the current density and eﬃciency in urea oxidation, be- 
cause  of  the  large  number  of  redox  active  sites  of  Ni/NiOx  NPs, 
with a unique macroporous conductive structure, which exhibited 
high electrocatalytic behavior and allowed for the rapid transport 
of electrons, electrolyte, and gaseous products [471] . 

6. Ni-free nonprecious catalysts 

Ni-based catalysts showed high electrochemical oxidation activ- 
ity toward low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons such as methanol, 
ethanol, and urea. However, few nonprecious elements, rather than 
Ni,  exhibited  activity  toward  them.  This  section  summarizes  the 
progress  in  the  preparation  of  Ni-free  nonprecious  catalysts  that 
are active toward the oxidation of low-molecular-weight hydrocar- 
bons. 

Co  is  already  used  as  an  effective  co-catalyst  that  signif- 
icantly  improves  the  oxidation  activity  of  Ni  toward  different 
low-molecular-weight  hydrocarbons  such  as  methanol  [385,386] , 
ethanol [149,375] , and urea [396,476] . However, Co showed poor 
electrochemical oxidation activity as a standalone catalyst. The ac- 
tivity of Co could be improved through alloying with other com- 
ponents and/or through preparing a catalyst with the high surface 
area. Whereas a standalone Co or Cu catalyst has no activity to- 
ward methanol oxidation, the doping of Co/CNF with different ra- 
tios of Cu [316] demonstrated high activity toward methanol ox- 
idation.  An  alloy  of  Cu 
95%  exhibited  higher  methanol  oxida- 
tion activity than that of Ni/CNF ( Fig. 22 b). Moreover, this catalyst 
showed an interesting redox peak potential that appeared during 
activation around 0.05 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) ( Fig. 22 a), which is related 
to the formation of (Cu 
95% )OOH, similar to that of NiOOH. Al- 
though methanol oxidation typically started at 0.3 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) 
( Fig. 22 b), the authors considered that (Cu 
95% )OOH is the ac- 
tive site for methanol oxidation [316] . 

5% Co

Similarly, neither Co nor Cr could act as an active standalone 
catalyst for methanol oxidation. However, an alloy catalyst of the 
proper composition, Cr/Co demonstrated a considerable activity to- 
ward methanol [314] and ethanol [477] oxidation. The authors re- 
vealed that the metal oxy-hydroxide (MOOH) is not the active site 
for ethanol oxidation, and the alloy that formed between Co and 

Cr is the active site. Notably, the optimum methanol and ethanol 
concentrations were 4 M, which is the highest reported optimum 
fuel concentrations for non-precious catalysts, as seen in Tables 4 –
9 .  Moreover,  the  anodic  peak  potential  increased  as  the  ethanol 
concentration increased, and the peak disappeared at high ethanol 
concentrations. This behavior could be attributed to the increase 
in the activity with increasing adsorbed ethanol molecules on the 
catalyst surface [209] . It was also found that doping of Co/CNF with 
nitrogen resulted in increasing the activity, where the current den- 
sity increased with increasing nitrogen content to 4% urea (initial 
content in the electrospinning solution) and then decreased with 
further  increases  in  urea.  The  nitrogen  increased  the  wettability 
of the Co/N-CNF catalyst surface and enhanced its electrical con- 
ductivity, resulting in improved methanol oxidation activity [315] . 
The  alloying  of  Co  with  Sr,  i.e.,  Co 
3 /CNF  [478] ,  did  not 
improve the Co activity toward urea oxidation, where a high onset 
potential above 0.55 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) was recorded with a feeble ox- 
idation activity up to 0.9 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) [478] . However, the dop- 
ing of Co with Cd (in NP form, i.e., CoCd/CNP) improved its activity 
toward ethanol oxidation [479] .

The preparation of nano-architectures is another method to in- 
crease  electrical  conductivity  and  the  electrocatalytic  activity  of 
metal oxides [480] . Using the hydrothermal method, followed by 
heat treatment at 500 °C under an inert atmosphere for 3 h, and 
then  in  air  at  350 °C  for  2 h,  Shenashen  et  al.  [481]  fabricated

3 O 
with different morphologies of nanoneedles (NNs), nanorod pellets 
(NRPs), and crossed-X nanosheets (X-NSs) ( Fig. 23 ). Contrary to the 
ﬁndings of the feeble activity of Co NPs toward methanol oxidation 
[482] , the prepared catalysts showed high stability and activity to- 
ward methanol oxidation ( Fig. 24 ) [481] . 

4 @C  architectures  (N-Co 

The  different  prepared  catalysts  demonstrated  pairs  of  redox 
couples  ( Fig.  24 a)  that  related  to  the  Co 2 + /Co 3 +  (a1/a4),  and 
Co 3 + /Co 4 + (a2/a3) [483] . NRPs had the largest enclosed area, indi- 
cating high accessibility to the active sites. The results in Fig. 24 b 
reveal high methanol oxidation activity. The variation of the activ- 
ity among the different catalysts would be related to the difference 
in  the  electron  conductivity  and  accessibility  to  the  active  sites. 
The different catalysts demonstrated acceptable stability, whether 
from the CV after 500 cycles ( Fig. 24 c), and the current discharge 
at 0.52 V vs. Hg/HgO ( Fig. 24 d). The excellent activity of the pre- 
pared  catalysts  could  be  ascribed  to  the  following  points:  i.  the 
mesoporous structure that facilitates the ion diffusion to the ac- 
tive sites, ii. low charge resistance due to the mesotubular veins, 
iii. easy mass transfer of reactants due to the presence of the ex-

a layer around the different morphologies, i.e., NRPs, NNs, and X-NSs during the hydrothermal treatment. The N-Co 3 O 4 @C structures were obtained through calcination at

terior groove surfaces and the interior mesospace frameworks, and 
iv. preferential growth along the high active [210] plane that con- 
tains more active sites of Co ions (Co 3 + ) toward methanol oxida- 
tion [484] . 
Co 

4  nanospheres, prepared by a hydrothermal process, also 
exhibited activity toward methanol oxidation and its activity signif- 
icantly increased when it was covered by polypyrrole (ppy) [400] . 
The authors related the increase in the activity by the ppy shell 
to an increase in the conductivity and the formation of electroac- 
tive CoNx sites that can catalyze the methanol oxidation. Addition- 
ally, through using different cobalt salts of chloride, sulfate, and ac- 
etates in hydrothermal processes, different Co 
4 morphologies of 
microﬂowers, microspheres, and nanograss, respectively, were pre- 
pared on Ni foam [485] . The nanosphere structure had the high- 
est  surface  area  of  100  m 2  g −1 ,  which  is  two  times  that  of  the 
nanoﬂower and 150% that of the nanograss, and therefore demon- 
strated the best activity toward methanol oxidation. Using a liquid 
crystal template and surfactant, Al-Sharif et al., prepared a meso- 
porous crystalline Co phosphate (CoP) [486] . The mesoporous CoP 
demonstrated  high  methanol  oxidation  activity,  compared  with 
that of bulk CoP or even mesoporous Co(OH) 
2 , which can be at- 
tributed to the high surface area of the mesoporous CoP (ten times 
higher than bulk CoP) and the role of the phosphate in promoting 
methanol oxidation.

SCE) for 80 0 0 s) [487] . The activity was related to the Co 4 + /Co 3 + 
redox in alkaline media [488] . Three-dimensional mesospheres of 
ZnCo 
4 /Ni foam, prepared by a hydrothermal process followed by 
heat treatment in air at 400 °C, showed methanol oxidation activ- 
ity with an onset potential of 0.5 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). It is important 
to highlight the fact that this is considered as a high onset poten- 
tial, and thus, it may not act as an effective FC anode catalyst. The 
mechanism of methanol oxidation was related to the formation of 
both of ZnOOH and CoOOH, according to the following equations 
[159,489]

Similarly, CuCo 

4 with a nanograss structure prepared on the 
surface of Cu foam showed higher activity toward methanol oxi- 
dation [489] . The methanol oxidation is typically similar to that of 
ZnCo 

4 , where CoOOH and CuOOH worked as the active sites.

which  was  higher  than  the  other  reported  value  (approximately

2 /Ni  foam,  and  Ni  foam  ( Fig. 
24 (c  and  d))  [491] .  The  high  activity  of  the  prepared  catalyst 
was  attributed  to:  i.  the  diversity  of  the  pore  structure,  which 
granted the ease of the transport of the electrolyte ions, ease of 
mass transfer, and thus highly accessible surface area and larger 
electrode/electrolyte interfaces [492] ; ii. the perfect connection be- 
tween the different layers granted the easy electron transfer be- 
tween the different layers; iii. the ultrathin NS of the MnO 
2 with a 
graphene-like structure ( Fig. 25 (a and b)) had a large surface area 
and a large number of edge sides, which were expected to have 
activity [4 93,4 94] . 

XPS  analysis  revealed  the  existence  of  a  surface  rich  with 
redox  couples  in  the  (Mn + 2 /Mn + 3 /Mn + 4  and  Co + 2 /Co + 3 ),  pro- 
viding  a  high  density  of  electrochemically  active  sites  [495] . 
Moreover, the multiple valence states of the metal cations in the 
core-shell  structure  of  the  MnO 
4  provide  eﬃcient 
donor–acceptor chemisorption sites that would enhance the urea 
oxidation [4 96,4 97] .

Cu  is  another  transition  metal  that  demonstrated  an  oxida- 
tion activity toward methanol oxidation in alkaline media [498] . 
A  leached  CuZn/Cu  electrode,  prepared  by  the  electrodeposition 
of  Cu  and  Zn  over  a  Cu  electrode  followed  by  etching  in  alkali, 

exhibited  higher  methanol  oxidation  activity  compared  with  the 
bare Cu electrode. The increase in the current was related to the 
increases  in  the  surface  area  and  porosity,  as  well  as  the  im- 
proved tolerance of the leached CuZn/Cu electrode toward poison- 
ing,  as  conﬁrmed  from  the  higher  forward  anodic  peak  current 
density  (I 
f )/reverse  anodic  peak  current  (I r )  ratios  [499] .  Multi- 
laminated NPs of Cu electrodeposited on the surface of the con- 
ductive substrate also exhibited high activity for methanol oxida- 
tion in alkaline media [500] . The activity of the laminated Cu was 
related to the large number of edges and corners of the laminated 
NPs.  However,  the  incorporation  of  a  polymer,  such  as  poly(2- 
amino-5-mercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole)-PAMT, between the laminated 
Cu NPs signiﬁcantly augmented the catalytic activity, owing to the 
enlarged  surface  area,  and  improved  the  electron  transfer.  Both 
Cu(OH) 
2  NWs, prepared on the surface of the Cu substrate using 
surface  chemical  oxidation  in  alkaline  media,  and  CuO  NW,  ob- 
tained  by  heat  treatment  of  Cu(OH) 
2  NWs  in  the  air  for  1 h  at 
300 °C, showed high methanol oxidation activity [501] . The high 
activity of the prepared NWs was related to the direct growth of 
the active sites on the surface of the substrate, which ensured high 
mechanical stability and fast electron transfer between the active 
sites and the current collector substrate. 

Both the chemical deposition of Cu, and electrochemical corro- 
sion  of  Cu  wire  resulted  in  increasing  the  activity  of  Cu  toward 
methanol oxidation (three to ﬁve times higher oxidation peak cur- 
rent density). The increased performance was related to the for- 
mation of Cu dendrites, which have a higher surface area, as well 
as the formation of Cu(III), respectively [502] . However, the tested 
concentration was very low, 40 mM methanol in 0.1 M NaOH. In

relative activity toward methanol oxidation in 0.5 M H 
However, using Cu/CuO under acidic media is not practical where 
corrosion would  immediately occur  [504] , and the reported cur- 
rent  could  even  be  associated  with  the  corrosion  of  Cu  rather 
than methanol oxidation. Further experiments must be carried out 
to clarify this point. The surface decoration of polypyrrole-coated 
nanoporous Cu (ppy/Cu) with tin resulted in a signiﬁcant increase 
in the ppy/Cu toward methanol oxidation in acidic solution [505] . 
This was related to the role of tin in increasing the tendency to- 
ward methanol dehydrogenation, increasing the electrode surface 
area, and oxidation of the intermediates.

By controlling the electrolytic current, time, and temperature, 
different morphologies of Fe 
3 , i.e., nanorods, nanospheres, 
4 ) 
and nanotubes, were successfully prepared [506] . All the prepared 
catalysts showed a high methanol oxidation activity that is com- 
parable to that obtained using Pt foil. The interesting point in this 
study that the onset potential is very low ( −0.4 V vs. Hg/HgO), and 
it is close to that of Pt foil ( Fig. 26 ). Moreover, the anodic peak cur- 
rent density in the case of the nanotube structure is better than 
that in the case of Pt foil. The authors related the activity of the 
alloy to the Mo atoms on the surface and the nanotube morphol- 
ogy, which increased the surface area and facilitated access of the 
fuel and electrolyte to the active sites. 

Other  trials  investigated  the  activity  of  Zn  prepared  in  a

ﬂower-like  morphology  [507] ,  (ZnO–CeO 
posite  materials  of  graphene  and  polyaniline  [509] .  Although 
2 )/CNF showed a low onset potential of −50 mV toward 
(ZnO–CeO 
methanol oxidation, the current was small [508] , while ZnO with 
a ﬂower-like morphology did not show remarkable activity toward 
urea oxidation, despite its high surface area [507] .

Two-dimensional  crystalline  structures  are  expected  to  have 
outstanding  properties  in  different  applications,  such  those  of 
graphene  [510,511] ,  that  are  strongly  attributed  to  the  structural 
features,  such  as  lateral  size  [512] ,  thickness,  defects,  and  crys- 
tal  planes  [512,513] .  Through  tuning  the  zeta  potential  of  aque- 
ous solutions of metal precursors, selective sedimentation of large 
2D  crystals  was  attained,  leaving  the  small  counterparts  in  the 
2  with  a  surplus  of  ex- 
solution.  The  small  2D  crystals  of  MoS 
posed edges are more electrocatalytically active compared to their

porous layer. The catalyst layer is the most essential part of the 
electrode,  which  contains  catalyst  NPs  that  are  the  active  sites. 
Binders  such  as  Teﬂon  [533]  or  Naﬁon  [534]  are  commonly  ap- 
plied to ﬁx the carbon and catalyst NPs to the surface of the dif- 
fusion and microporous layers, respectively. Such a layered struc- 
ture  of  the  electrodes  resulted  in  decreasing  the  electrical  con- 

7. In-situ preparation of catalyst on the diffusion layer 

The  electrode  of  a  FC  consists  of  three  different  layers,  i.e., 
the diffusion layer, microporous layer, and catalyst layer [7,519] , as 
shown in the schematic diagram ( Fig. 27 ). On the surface of the 
electrode, a highly conductive current collector (gold-plated stain- 
less steel), equipped with ﬂow channels, is placed to collect elec- 
trons for an external circuit. 

The diffusion layer is usually made of carbon paper [520,521] , 
or carbon cloth [104–106] , and metallic materials such as Ni foam 
[522,523]  and  stainless  steel  wire  cloth  [524]  have  also  recently 
been  used.  The  diffusion  layer  is  responsible  for  facilitating  the 
mass  transfer,  and  thus,  it  usually  contains  macrospores  to  per- 
form this function. Over the surface of the diffusion layer, a mi- 
croporous layer is usually used to smooth the surface of the diffu- 
sion layer [525] . Carbon NPs are the common materials that are 
used  for  the  microporous  layer.  However,  CNFs  [526–528] ,  CNTs 
[529,530] , and Gr [531,532] have recently been used in the micro-

ductivity  of  the  electrode,  and  the  usage  of  the  binder  (with 
low or no electrical conductivity) not only resulted in decreasing 
the  electrical  conductivity,  but  it  also  blocked  the  pores  of  the 
electrode [535] . 

Moreover,  the  CNPs  applied  to  the  microporous  layer  block 
the  macrospores  of  the  diffusion  layer,  and  catalyst  NPs  block 
part  of  the  microporous  layer.  Furthermore,  a  considerable  part 
of the catalyst is lost during the electrode preparation. Some re- 
searchers tend to add a conductive material to the prepared cata- 
lyst [536] , such as polyaniline polymer [537] , and graphene [538] . 
However, such additives increase the electrical conductivity at the 
expense of the active sites, and some of the active sites are fur- 
ther lost through chemical or physical bonding with the conductive 
material [539] . Another effective strategy is the direct preparation 
of the catalyst on the surface of a diffusion layer (such as carbon 
cloth  and  Ni  foam),  which  would  have  numerous  advantages  as 
concluded here: 

(i) High  mechanical  stability  of  the  catalyst  layer  due  to  the 

good contact with the diffusion layer [540–544] . 

(ii) Excellent  electron  transfer  due  to  the  binder-free  process 

[545] . 

(iii) The catalyst was prepared directly on the surface, which re- 
sults in complete exposure of the catalyst without loss in the 
pores of the microporous or in the diffusion layer. 

(iv) Easy mass transfer to the active sites due to the macropores 

of the diffusion layer and binder-free process. 

(v) In the case of a metallic diffusion layer, such as Ni foam, the 
extension of the metallic diffusion layer is used as a current 
collector, thereby further improving the electron transfer in 
the cell. 

The following section summarizes the progress achieved to fab- 
ricate standalone electrodes using direct preparation of the catalyst 
on the diffusion layer. 

For  the  abovementioned  reasons,  NiO  nanowalls,  hydrother- 
mally prepared on Ni foam, exhibited high urea oxidation activity 
2 has a 
and stability [546] . A single-layered (SL) structure of Ni(OH) 
higher surface area and larger number of active sites compared to 
those of the multilayered (ML) structure of the nanowall Ni(OH) 
2 
[539] . Restacking of the single layer usually occurs in liquid de- 
lamination during the solvent evaporation [547–549] , whereas in 
reverse microemulsion, a mass of surfactant is used to restrict the 
2 . However, these surfactants cover a consid- 
growth of the Ni(OH) 
erable  portion  of  the  Ni(OH) 
2  active  sites.  Using  a  solvothermal 
method at 120 °C for 4 h, Lin et al. [539] successfully prepared a 
2 NSs 
complete electrode structure composed of single layer Ni(OH) 
(SL- αNi(OH) 
2 -NS) on the surface of carbon cloth with a nanowall 
structure of 0.8 nm thickness. The authors reported that the solvent 
type plays a vital role in the preparation of the SL Ni(OH) 
2 struc- 
ture. Methanol, with a lower surface tension than that of water, 
thoroughly wets the surface of the CC and promoted the growth 
of metastable SL αNi(OH) 
2 NS, compared to stable ML β-Ni(OH) 
2 
in  the  case  of  using  water.  The  d  spacing  of  the  001  planes  in 
2  NS,  8 ˚A,  is  found  to  be  larger  than  that  in  case  of β- 
αNi(OH) 
2 , 4.8 ˚A. Such a larger d spacing is suitable for ion trans- 
Ni(OH) 
fer between the sheets and affords better lattice strain, which pro- 
vides  stability  during  repeated  electrochemical  processes  (during 
urea oxidation), and thus better performance of the α-Ni(OH) 
2 NS 
(436 mA cm −2 ) compared to that of β-Ni(OH) 
2 NS (12.4 mA cm −2 ), 
at  0.5 V  (vs.  Ag/AgCl)  in  1 M  KOH  with  0.33 M  urea  [550–552] . 
The  better  performance  of  SL  αNi(OH) 
2  NS  was  related  to  the 
high  speciﬁc  surface  area  (208.8  m 2  g −1  vs.  25.5  m 2  g −1 ),  the 
high  ECSA  (ECSA  of  the  SL  α-Ni(OH) 
2  NS  is  four  times  that  of 
the ML β-Ni(OH) 
2  NS), the only adsorption of ions occurs in the 
non-Faradic region or electric double layer [553–556] , and the low 
charge transfer resistance (better UOR kinetic) [64] . However, the 

long-term stability showed a degradation in the current generated 
at 0.5 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) due to the transfer from the SL αNi(OH) 
2 NS 
to ML β-Ni(OH) 
3 as 
2 NS [557,558] , and the appearance of the NiCO 
a result for the strong absorption of the CO 
2 on the surface of the 
Ni active sites [128,133,134] . Ji et al. prepared open-ended nickel 
hydroxide nanotubes on the surface of Ni foam using electroless 
plating over a ZnO nanorod template, as shown schematically in 
Fig. 28 a. The prepared layer showed a typical nanotube structure, 
as shown in the inset of Fig. 28 c, compared with a NS structure 
obtained  without  using  a  ZnO  template.  The  nanotube  structure 
showed improved activity compared with that of the NSs with and 
without urea ( Fig. 28 (d and e)), where the current density reached 
60 mA  cm −2  g −1  at  0.5 V  vs.  SCE  compared  to  10 mA  cm −2  g −1 
in  1 M  KOH  containing  0.33 M  urea  in  the  case  of  Ni(OH) 
2 
NSs [393] . 

Among different bimetal hydroxides of Ni–Cr, Ni–Mn, Ni–Fe, Ni–
Zn,  Ni–Co,  and  Ni–Cu,  prepared  on  the  surface  of  carbon  cloth 
ﬁbers  using  hydrothermal  treatment  at  120 °C  for  14 h,  Ni–Fe 
demonstrated the best activity and stability toward methanol ox- 
idation ( Fig. 29 (g and h)) [559] . It was also found that the mor- 
phology  depended  on  the  metal  combination  ( Fig.  29 (a–f)).  The 
combination  of  Fe  with  Ni  increased  the  surface  area  by  ten 
times compared to Ni(OH) 
2 , and raised the conductivity from 0.1–
0.2 mS cm −1 to 3.5–6.5 mS cm −1 [560] . EIS demonstrated smaller 
semicircles in the case of Ni–Fe hydroxides, indicating fast charge 
transfer and reaction kinetics [131] . 

2 or N 

The nanowall structure of cubic NiO, obtained by thermal treat- 
ment of hydrothermally grown α-Ni(OH) 
2  nanowalls on Ni foam 
(NF),  achieved  high  urea  oxidation  activity,  compared  with  that 
prepared on the st. st. or from NiO powder deposited on the st. 
st.  sheet  surface  [561] .  The  nanowall  structure  had  higher  ECSA 
2 NPs), high electron transfer between the 
(10 times that of Ni(OH) 
NS and the Ni support, and facile mass transfer of the electrolyte 
and  fuel  [65,394] .  Furthermore,  the  modiﬁcation  of  the  surface 
atoms through structural engineering [562,563] , defect engineering 
[494,564] , and surface/interface treatment [565,566] , would further 
increase the activity. Tong et al. [395] prepared a porous NiMoO 
4 
(p-NiMoO 
4 )NS  on 
4 )NS  and  surface-oxygen-vacancy-rich  (r-NiMoO 
Ni  foam  using  a  hydrothermal  method  followed  by  heat  treat- 
ment at 450 °C under O 
2 atmospheres, respectively. The crys- 
talline  structures  of  Ni  and  Mn  are  similar  in  the  two  catalysts. 
4 contains more signiﬁcant oxygen defects than 
However, r-NiMoO 
those in the case of p-NiMoO 
4 , especially those attached to Mo. 
The r-NiMoO 
4 catalyst demonstrated high catalytic activity toward 
urea oxidation ( Fig. 30 a) that is higher than other catalysts, i.e., p- 
4 , NiMo precursor/NF, and NF ( Fig. 30 b). The high activity 
NiMoO 
of r-NiMoO 
4 was because of the oxygen vacancy that improved the 
kinetics of the urea oxidation, as is clear from the lower slope in 
the Tafel plot ( Fig. 30 c), the improved charge transfer, as shown by 
the smaller semicircle in the high-frequency EIS spectra ( Fig. 30 d), 
and the improved mass transfer, as shown by the independence 
of the current generation on the scan rate ( Fig. 30 f). Moreover, r- 
NiMoO 
4 demonstrated high stability, as indicated by the negligible 
change in performance even after 10 0 0 cycles ( Fig. 30 e). The high 
activity of r-NiMoO 
4 was related to, i. the delocalized free electrons 
near the oxygen defect, which activated the nearest metal ions to 
be more active toward fuel (urea) adsorption, ii. the shift in the 
4 to the conduction band edge [567–570] , 
Fermi surface of r-NiMoO 
and iii. the 3D structure of r-NiMoO 
4 , which facilitated the mass 
transfer of the electrolyte ions and urea to the active sites, as well 
as the facile removal of the reaction products.

multidirectional NWs on the NSs at 9 h). The 3D structure of the 
2 –NW@NS/Ni obtained at 9 h showed higher activity than 
Ni(OH) 
those prepared at 6 and 8 h ( Fig. 31 a), better activity than Ni foam, 
activated  Ni  foam  (200  cycles  of  CV  from  0  to  1 V  in  1 M  KOH 
using  5 mV  s −1 ),  and  even  better  than  Pt/C  over  Ni  foam,  using 
0.33 M urea in 1 M KOH at 5 mV s −1  ( Fig. 31 b). The 3D Ni(OH) 
2 - 
NW@NS/Ni foam also exhibited high electrochemical and mechan- 
ical stability, where the current was discharged continuously for 
40 h, and the morphology was not affected, owing to the excellent 
contact  between  the  nanoarrays  and  the  Ni  foam,  which  caused 
good  mechanical  stability  high  electrical  conductivity,  and  facile 
electron  transfer  [545,572] .  The  signiﬁcant  increase  in  the  sur- 
face area (33 times that of the geometrical surface area) [573,574] , 
led to the superior behavior of the 3D Ni(OH) 
2 -NW@NS/Ni. More- 
over, the prepared structure would work as a self-standing elec- 

trode  without  need  for  deposition  on  another  material  or  even 
using ionic conductors, such as Naﬁon, which have low electrical 
conductivity  [535,575,576] .  The  prepared  3D  Ni(OH) 
2 -NW@NS/Ni 
foam also exhibited high methanol oxidation activity [577] , which 
could be assigned to: i. facile mass transfer due to the presence 
of  the  macropores  in  its  structure  [383,578]  and  the  increased 
number  of  active  sites  [579] ; ii.  high  conductivity  [578] , fast  ki- 
netics,  and  thus,  lower  onset  potential  [580] ,  iii.  high  roughness 
factor [383,581] ; and iv. perfect catalytic charge and mass transfer 
[517,582] . 

In another study, Wang et al. [50] prepared porous ﬂower-like 
Ni 
2  NSs  of  a  ﬂower- 
2 P  on  Ni  foam  by  phosphating  the  Ni(OH) 
like  structure  prepared  by  a  hydrothermal  process,  as  shown 
schematically in Fig. 32 a. The high-resolution TEM images revealed

2  NSs  ( Fig.  32 b). 
Such a porous structure facilitates good contact between the elec- 
trolyte  ions  and  the  active  sites,  improving  the  interfacial  reac- 
tions [392] , and the ECSA (based on the charge required for the 
reduction in NiOOH in the cathodic scan [583] ). The porous Ni 
2 P 
NS sample showed excellent activity toward urea oxidation with 
an onset potential and current density of 0.24 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) and 
750 mA cm −2 , compared to 0.27 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) and 450 mA cm −2 
2 NS, respectively, at 15 mV s −1 using 0.6 M urea in 5 M 
for Ni(OH) 
KOH ( Fig. 32 d). 

Through surface engineering, Yue et al. [60] prepared NiO NSs 
on the surface of Ni foam (NF), i.e., NiO/NF using the hydrother- 
mal method followed by annealing at 300 °C for 2 h, and electrode- 
posited (NiO-Ni/NF). The hybrid NiO-Ni/NF catalyst revealed high 
activity in terms of high current density and decreased onset po- 
tential toward urea oxidation. When the scan rate was increased 
from 5 to 50 mV s −1 , no signiﬁcant effect on the current density 

was observed, demonstrating an eﬃcient charge and mass trans- 
fer  of  the  NiO-Ni/NF.  The  improvement  in  the  performance  can 
assigned  to  the  binder-free  electrode  structure  (providing  high 
electrical conductivity, high mass transfer, and high ECSA), the syn- 
ergetic effect between the excellent contact between the Ni, NiO, 
and Ni foam (improving both the ion and electron transfer), and 
the increased number of active sites.

In another study using the hydrothermal method and electrode- 
position, a porous Co 
4 (core)/NiO (shell) is prepared and investi- 
gated for methanol oxidation [584] . The prepared core-shell struc- 
ture  showed  superior  methanol  oxidation  activity,  owing  to  the 
synergetic  effect  between  Co  and  Ni,  good  electrical  conductiv- 
ity, excellent mechanical stability, and the porous structure of the 
core-shell  structure  granting  full  access  of  the  electrolyte  to  the 
active  sites.  Similarly,  NiSe  NWs,  prepared  by  the  solvothermal

one  of  the  best-reported  performances of  a  DUFC  with  a  power 
density  of  38 mW  cm −2  with  a  slight  loss  in  performance  after 
180 h [396] . The oxidation activities of different standalone elec- 
trodes are summarized in Table 11 . 

8. Challenges and recommendations 

(i) The differences between the in-situ and ex-situ onset poten- 
tials are not clear yet and detailed studies are needed to ex- 
plore the difference. 

(ii) The different methods applied to increase the OCV are based 
on using a basic anolyte and an acidic catholyte on the two 
sides  of  the  Naﬁon  membrane  (acidic  character).  The  cell 
lifetime is expected to be short due to the corrosion of the 
transition metals by the acidic membrane. Preparing an ac- 
tive anodic non-precious-metal-based catalyst with high cor- 
rosion resistivity would eliminate the use of the basic anodic 
media (even it is preferable from a kinetics point of view), as 
it can work effectively in acidic media. Such a catalyst could 
be achieved in the following ways: 
a. Metal carbides and nitrides have a high corrosion resis- 
tivity and considerable oxidation activity. The preparation 
of nanosized metal carbides and nitrides is considered as 
an effective strategy to increase the activity and maintain 
a high corrosion resistivity. 

b. MXenes are a new class of 2D transition metal carbides, 
nitrides,  or  carbonitrides  that  have  demonstrated  out- 
standing  properties  [585–587] .  MXenes  have  exhibited 
superior performance in batteries [588–590] , supercapac- 

itors [591–593] , and solar energy applications [594,595] , 
or  as  photocatalysts  [596–598]  and  electrocatalysts 
[599–602] .  Furthermore,  MXenes  are  also  prepared  in 
different morphologies such as nanotubes and nanorib- 
bons [603–605] . To date, no applications of MXenes as 
catalysts  or  catalyst  supports  for  a  non-precious-metal 
catalyst  for  the  oxidation  of  low-molecular-weight  hy- 
drocarbons have been reported. It is expected that MX- 
enes could be applied as an effective catalyst or catalyst 
support for Ni-based catalysts, or even for Ni-free non- 
precious catalysts. 

c. Metal chalcogenides (phosphides, sulﬁdes, and selenides) 
do not only have a high electrical conductivity but are 
also highly stability in acidic media [606–608] .Thus they 
can be used in contact with a Naﬁon membrane and ap- 
plied to hybrid-pH operating conditions. 

d. The coverage of the catalyst with a thin layer of a con- 
ducting polymer, such as ppy or polyaniline can protect 
the transition metal from corrosion by improving the cat- 
alyst  activity  through  increasing  its  conductivity.  Addi- 
tionally, the transition metal-N sites can work as addi- 
tional active sites for the oxidation process. Furthermore, 
the  heat  treatment  of  such  materials  will  leave  a  thin 
layer of nitrogen-doped carbon that increases the activ- 
ity and protects the catalyst from corrosion [400] . 

e. The  preparation  of  metal/CNF  materials  by  heat  treat- 
ment of electrospun nanoﬁbers composed of transition- 
metal  precursors  and  low-stability  polymers,  such  as 
PVA,  resulted  in  covering  the  transition  metal  with  a 
thin  layer  of  carbon  that  can  protect  it  while  retain- 
ing  its  catalytic  activity  [609,610] .  A  graphene  layer  (a 
few-nanometer thick) [611] , a polymer layer [612] , or a

porous oxide layer [613] , can be used for the same pur- 
pose. 

(iii) Co is one of the elements that resulted in a signiﬁcant de- 
crease in the onset potential, but at the expense of the elec- 
trooxidation activity. Surface engineering can help in prepar- 
ing a proper NiCo alloy hierarchical structure that would ex- 
hibit a high activity in terms of high current density and low 
onset potential. 

(iv) Nanoporous  anodic  aluminum  oxide  (AAO)  template  is 
a  facile  method  for  preparing  one-,  two-,  and  three- 
dimensional nanostructures [373] . Little work has been done 
to prepare nonprecious catalysts for the anodes of low hy- 
drocarbon fuel cells. It is expected that preparing two- and 
three-  dimensional  catalysts  using  the  AAO  template  will 
lead to signiﬁcant improvements in performance. 

(v) Carbothermal treatment of ammonium metatungstate under 
Ar and H 
2 atmospheres resulted in the formation of a mix- 
ture of mesoporous carbon and mesoporous WC [238] . The 
obtained  WC  showed  a  superior  activity  toward  methanol 
oxidation under acidic conditions with 200 mV overpotential 
compared to that of Pt, without catalyst poisoning (no CO 
or other harmful intermediates). Such material is expected 
to show a high performance in case it used as a support for 
Ni-based catalysts under basic conditions. 

(vi) Nitrogen  signiﬁcantly  improved  the  catalytic  performance, 
whether as a support or with a support including the em- 
bedded  part  of  the  catalyst.  However,  no  complete  data 
are available on the actual role of nitrogen. Future work is 
needed to clarify its role and optimize its composition. 
(vii) In all previous studies, Cd was incorporated by heat treat- 
ment at high temperatures, and the majority was lost dur- 
ing  preparation.  CNF  prepared by  electrospinning followed 
by  the  reduction  of  the  metal  salts  of  Cd  and/or  Ni  salts 
could be an effective method to obtain a higher Cd content. 
(viii) Although  much  research  has  been  dedicated  to  transition 
metals, mainly Ni and its alloys, there is only one report on 
tungsten carbide nanoﬁbers prepared by electrospinning. It 
is well known that the use of a metal carbide support as 
a transition metal signiﬁcantly improves the activity; there- 
fore, this work must be expanded by using the metal carbide 
and/or nitride either as a support for a nonprecious catalyst 
or as a standalone catalyst. 
a. Doping phosphides with relatively cheap rare-earth met- 
als such as Ce improved their electrochemical activity to- 
ward  the  hydrogen  evolution  reaction  through  modify- 
ing their physicochemical and electrochemical properties. 
This is expected to beneﬁt the electrochemical oxidation 

activity  toward  low-molecular-weight  organics,  such  as 
methanol, ethanol, and urea. 

b. Nitrogen  doping  of  phosphide  improved  its  activity  to- 
ward hydrogen evolution [614] , which is expected to in- 
crease its oxidation activity toward low-molecular-weight 
hydrocarbons as well. 

c. It was demonstrated that TiN and WC NPs have a syner- 
getic effect on the general activity of Ni [615,616] . Such a 
highly active porous structure might be beneﬁcial in the 
application as a non-precious catalyst for electrochemical 
oxidation. 

d. A  leaf-like  conductive  structure  of  a  Co  MOF  nanoar- 
ray  was  successfully  prepared  on  the  surface  of  a  car- 
bon cloth exhibiting a high activity toward glucose ox- 
idation  with  an  onset  potential  of  approximately  0.2 V 
(vs.  Ag/AgCl)  [617] , which could  be  used  for  methanol, 
ethanol, and urea oxidation. 

e. Defect  engineering  such  as  enriching  the  surface  with 
oxygen  defects  resulted  in  a  signiﬁcant  increase  in  the 
activity; however, the authors only investigated one tem- 
perature (450 °C). Changing the temperature of the heat 
treatment is expected to change the activity, so there is 
probably  an  optimum  heat  treatment  temperature  that 
requires investigation. 

(ix) The in-situ preparation of MOFs over macroporus substrates 
such  as  Ni  foam  demonstrated  a  superior  performance  in 
energy storage devices [618,619] , and water oxidation [620] . 
A similar performance is expected for the oxidation of urea 
and simple alcohols. 

9. Conclusions 

In this review, we have discussed the feasibility of using non- 
precious-metal-based catalysts in FCs based on the reported on- 
set potential, as well as promising results for actual cell operation 
and increasing the cell voltage. Moreover, we have discussed the 
progress achieved in preparing active nonprecious electrooxidation 
catalysts for methanol, ethanol, and urea. 

The following conclusions can be drawn: 

(i) Despite  the  signiﬁcant  achievements  in  preparing  non- 
precious-metal-based  catalysts  with  high  electrochemical 
oxidation activities comparable to that of Pt in terms of the 
current generation, the onset potential of 0.3 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) 
(using a three-electrode cell arrangement) is far from those 
of Pt or Pt alloys ( −0.5 V (vs. Ag/AgCl)). Even the actual on- 
set potential of −0.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) (using a two-electrode 

M.A. Abdelkareem, E.T. Sayed and H.O. Mohamed et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 77 (2020) 100805

cell arrangement) is still high, and signiﬁcant effort s must 
be done to decrease it. 

(No. 2019R1A2C1006356 ) and by the University of Sharjah , Project 
No. 1602040631-P . 

(ii) The onset potential measured ex-situ cell can be used as an 
indicator for the cell voltage, but cannot be used to calculate 
it. 

(iii) Hybrid-pH conditions at the anode (basic) and the cathode 
(acidic) effectively increase the oxidation activity at the an- 
ode while maintaining a high cell voltage. Moreover, apply- 
ing an oxidant rather than O 
2 with a high reduction poten- 
tial, such as hydrogen peroxide and metal ions, is an effec- 
tive strategy to increase the cell voltage. 

(iv) CO 

2  desorption  from  the  surface  of  the  Ni  catalyst  is  the 
rate-determining step in urea oxidation reactions. Neverthe- 
less, CO 
2 is the major factor that results in the drastic degra- 
dation of the performance of the Ni catalyst due to the for- 
mation of the carbonate and/or bicarbonate. 

(v) Alloying of Ni with metallic and nonmetallic elements sig- 
niﬁcantly improved its oxidation activity, and the non-oxide 
form  of  Ni  demonstrated  a  higher  activity  than  the  oxide 
form. 

(vi) Enriching  the  surface  with  oxygen  defects  resulted  in  sig- 
niﬁcant increases in the activity; the high activity was re- 
lated to: i) the presence of delocalized free electrons near 
the oxygen defects, which activated the nearest metal ions 
toward urea adsorption, ii) the shift in the Fermi surface of 
4 to the conduction band edge [567–570] , iii) the 3D 
r-NiMoO 
4  facilitated the mass transfer of elec- 
structure of r-NiMoO 
trolyte ions and urea to the active sites as well as the easy 
removal of reaction products. 

(vii) Increasing the surface area of the catalyst by using new sup- 
port  morphologies  or  preparing  the  catalyst  itself  in  new 
morphologies are effective and important strategies for in- 
creasing the surface area and improving the mass transfer, 
thus improving the performance of non-precious catalysts. 

(viii) The in-situ growth of a catalyst directly on the surface of the 
diffusion layer is a promising method to increase its activity 
and stability, showing the following advantages: 
a. High mechanical stability due to the intimate contact be- 
tween  the  catalyst  layer  and  the  diffusion  layer  [540–
544] . 

b. An excellent electron transfer between the catalyst and 

the diffusion layer [545] . 

c. High exposure of the catalyst, and no catalyst loss in the 

diffusion or microporous layer. 

d. The  open  structure  of  the  macropores  of  the  diffusion 
layer  and  the  absence  of  a  microporous  layer  result  in 
outstanding access of the reactants to the active sites, as 
well as the easy removal of the products. 

e. Metallic  diffusion  layer  can  act  as  a  current  collector, 

which would further improve the electron transfer. 
(ix) Although  standalone  transition  metals,  as  opposed  to  Ni, 
have low or no oxidation activity, preparing them in nanoar- 
chitecture structures, and/or alloying them with each other 
led to oxidation activities that were sometimes higher than 
those of Ni-based catalysts.

rect Methanol Fuel Cell (DMFC), thereby; the methanol 
concentration which can be used eﬃciently in DMFC has 
been increased from 7 to 100 wt%. After his Ph.D. study, 
he worked on a project for the fabrication of a complete 
passive fuel cell stack operated with high methanol con- 
centration based on this novel electrode structure. As the 
high cost of the electrodes of the direct methanol fuel 
cells is one of the main obstacles facing their commercial- 
ization, Dr. Mohammad is working on the development 
of nano-sized material for the replacement of the Pt catalyst with non-precious 
catalysts. Dr. Mohammad secured international and national funds of more than 
60 0,0 0 0 USD through them he built up two pioneer labs in the ﬁeld of the Solid 
Oxide Fuel Cells and Microbial Fuel Cells. Right now Dr. Mohammad is working as 
an Associate Professor in the Sustainable and Renewable Energy Engineering De- 
partment, University Sharjah, UAE. He is working on developing energy conver- 
sion/storage devices such as fuel cells and supercapacitors. Dr. Mohammad pub- 
lished more than 60 SCI journal papers. 

Enas Taha Sayed got her Ph.D. from Japan in the ﬁeld 
of bioelectrochemical energy devices, i.e., microbial fuel 
cells. During this period, she has studied the electrochem- 
ical behavior of S. cerevisiae , Baker’s yeast, in a mediator- 
less microbial fuel cell. Moreover, she has studied the ef- 
fect of modifying carbon anodes on the cell performance. 
Then Dr. Enas participated different national and interna- 
tional projects for developing fuel cells with a total fund 
of more than 60 0,0 0 0 USD. Dr. Enas has strong experi- 
ence in the different electrochemical techniques used for 
the evaluation of the different electrode materials for fuel 
cells in general and speciﬁcally in microbial fuel cells. Dr. 
Enas published more than 25 SCI journal papers.
