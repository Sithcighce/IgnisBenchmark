    "question_text": "What are the mechanisms of alkali-induced slagging and fouling in boilers, and how do the melting temperatures of alkali compounds correlate with deposit formation?",
    "standard_answer": "Alkali-induced slagging and fouling occur through a multi-step mechanism initiated by the release of volatile alkali species (KCl, KOH, K2SO4) during combustion. These compounds condense on heat exchanger surfaces when flue gas temperatures drop below their dew points (e.g., KCl condenses at ~700°C). The process involves: (1) Condensation of alkali chlorides/sulfates forming a sticky initial layer due to their low melting temperatures (KCl mp: 770°C, K2SO4 mp: 1069°C). (2) Capture of fine ash particles by this sticky layer, which then undergo re-enrichment with alkali, maintaining adhesion. (3) Deposition of coarse particles trapped by the sticky surface, building a multi-layer slag structure. The low melting temperatures of alkali chlorides (e.g., NaCl mp: 801°C) are critical, as they remain molten or semi-molten on surfaces, promoting adhesion and growth. Fuels with high chlorine content favor KCl formation, which has lower melting points than sulfates, increasing slagging propensity. The presence of silica and alumina can form eutectics with alkali, further lowering ash fusion temperatures. This deposition insulates heat transfer surfaces, reducing efficiency and causing operational failures.",

      "1": "Alkali-induced slagging and fouling are attributed to the low melting temperature of alkali compounds formed in thermochemical conversion processes.",
      "2": "Due to the low melting temperatures, alkali chlorides and sulfates condense on the heating surface at lower flue gas temperatures, causing the formation of an initial sticky layer. Fine particles containing alkali metals, chlorine, and sulfur deposit on the initial layer, and capture coarse large particles."

    "question_text": "Explain how chlorine and sulfur influence alkali metal mobility and speciation during biomass/coal combustion, focusing on the roles of oxygen-rich versus reducing atmospheres and the transformation between alkali atoms and hydroxides.",
    "standard_answer": "Chlorine and sulfur significantly enhance alkali metal mobility during combustion by facilitating the formation of volatile alkali species. Chlorine increases mobility by promoting alkali release as alkali chlorides, while sulfur facilitates transformation to alkali sulfates. The combustion atmosphere plays a critical role in alkali speciation: in oxygen-rich environments, adequate oxygen can oxidize alkali atoms into alkali hydroxides. Conversely, in reducing atmospheres, the presence of H radicals can reduce alkali hydroxides back into alkali atoms. These transformations affect the fate of alkali metals during combustion, influencing their potential to cause operational problems such as corrosion and deposition. The interplay between chlorine, sulfur, and atmospheric conditions determines whether alkali metals remain as reactive atoms or transform into hydroxide compounds, with important implications for combustion system design and operation.",

    "question_text": "How do the different chemical forms of alkali metals in biomass and coal (water-soluble, NH4Ac-soluble, HCl-soluble, insoluble) affect their release behavior during thermochemical conversion, and what general patterns are observed regarding which forms contribute most to gas-phase release?",
    "standard_answer": "The release behavior of alkali metals during thermochemical conversion is strongly influenced by their initial chemical forms in the fuel. Water-soluble alkali metals, present as ions held by water inside biomass and coal pore structure as water-soluble salts, are highly mobile and readily released. NH4Ac-soluble compounds, which are present as exchangeable ions organically bound with carboxyl groups, also contribute significantly to release. In contrast, HCl-soluble compounds (coordinated metal ions organically bonded with nitrogen- or oxygen-containing functional groups) and insoluble compounds (present as silicate minerals) show much lower release tendencies. The general pattern observed is that with increasing combustion temperature, the release ability of alkali metals is enhanced, but this enhancement primarily comes from water-soluble and NH4Ac-soluble alkali metals, while HCl-soluble and insoluble alkali metals are almost not released. These patterns are established through sequential extraction procedures that categorize alkali metals into these four solubility fractions, providing insight into their relative mobility and release potential during thermal conversion processes.",

      "1": "Generally, the alkali species in biomass and coal can be divided into two types, i.e., organic compounds and inorganic compounds.

What specific third-order rate constants were determined for sodium (Na) recombination with different third-body species (He, N₂, CO₂) at approximately 800 K?",
    "standard_answer": "The identification and confirmation of the third-body recombination reaction A + O₂ + M → AO₂ + M for alkali atoms was achieved through atomic absorption spectroscopy measurements in lean H₂/O₂/N₂ flames. Researchers observed a decay pattern of alkali atom concentration that depended on oxygen concentration, which indicated the involvement of O₂ in alkali consumption and led to the proposal of this recombination mechanism where M acts as a third body to stabilize the formed alkali superoxide (AO₂). For sodium specifically, the reaction rates were quantitatively determined in heated cell experiments around 800 K using time-resolved AAS. The specific third-order rate constants measured for Na + O₂ + M were approximately 6 × 10⁻³¹ cm⁶ molecule⁻² s⁻¹ with helium (He) as the third body, 1 × 10⁻³⁰ cm⁶ molecule⁻² s⁻¹ with nitrogen (N₂), and 4 × 10⁻³⁰ cm⁶ molecule⁻² s⁻¹ with carbon dioxide (CO₂). The variation in rates reflects the differing collisional efficiencies of the third-body species, with CO₂ exhibiting the highest efficiency due to its greater molecular complexity and enhanced energy transfer capability compared to the simpler He and N₂ molecules.",
