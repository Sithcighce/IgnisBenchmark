Transportation of people and goods largely relies on the use of fossil hydrocarbons, contributing to global
warming and problems with local air quality. There are a number of alternatives to fossil fuels that can
avoid a net carbon emission and can also decrease pollutant emissions. However, many have significant
difficulty in competing with fossil fuels due to either limited availability, limited energy density, high
cost, or a combination of these.

Methanol (CH 3 OH) is one of these alternatives, which was demonstrated in large fleet trials during the
1980s and 1990s, and is currently again being introduced in various places and applications. It can be
produced from fossil fuels, but also from biomass and from renewable energy sources in carbon capture
and utilization schemes. It can be used in pure form or as a blend component, in internal combustion
engines (ICEs) or in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). These features added to the fact it is a liquid
fuel, making it an efficient way of storing and distributing energy, make it stand out as one of the most
attractive scalable alternatives.

This review focuses on the use of methanol as a pure fuel or blend component for ICEs. First, we in-
troduce methanol historically, briefly introduce the various methods for its production, and summarize
health and safety of using methanol as a fuel. Then, we focus on its use as a fuel for ICEs. The current
data on the physical and chemical properties relevant for ICEs are reviewed, highlighting the differences
with fuels such as ethanol and gasoline. These are then related to the research reported on the behaviour
of methanol and methanol blends in spark ignition and compression ignition engines. Many of the prop-
erties of methanol that are significantly different from those of for example gasoline (such as its high
heat of vaporization) lead to advantages as well as challenges. Both are extensively discussed.

Methanol’s performance, in terms of power output, peak and part load efficiency, and emissions for-
mation is summarized, for so-called flex-fuel engines as well as for dedicated engines. We also briefly
touch upon engine hardware changes and material compatibility. Methanol fuel reforming using engine
waste heat is discussed, as a potential route towards further increases in efficiency and decreases in emis-
sions. Next to the experimental work, research efforts into modelling the behaviour of methanol as a fuel
are also reviewed, including mixture formation, normal and abnormal combustion. Methanol’s proper-
ties such as high latent heat, fast burning velocity, high knock-resistance and no carbon-to-carbon bonds
are shown to leverage engine technology developments such as increased compression ratios, downsizing
and dilution; enabling much increased engine efficiencies.

Finally, we point out the current gaps in knowledge to indicate which areas future research should be
directed at.

1. Introduction

Methanol, CH

3 OH, is a simple oxygenated hydrocarbon that is
among the top five of most widely traded chemicals in the world
[1] ,  traditionally  used  to  produce  adhesives,  paints,  LCD  screens,
silicones,  pharmaceuticals,  and  also  used  on  large  scale  by  the
wood and automotive industry. Since a couple of years, it is in-
creasingly being used for energy applications, with some 20 mil-
lion tons of methanol being produced yearly as fuel or fuel blend
component, a number that is increasing every year [2] .

Scalability is one of the main reasons for investigating methanol
as a transport fuel. Its ease of synthesis and broad range of source
feedstocks makes it a strong candidate for a sustainable fuel with
the  potential  to  significantly  reduce  the  fossil  carbon  footprint
of  transportation.  The  increased  efficiency  with  which  it  can  be
synthesized in relation to ethanol or synthetic hydrocarbons (see
Sections 1.1 and 1.4 ), coupled with the improved brake thermal ef-
ficiency it produces in combustion systems (see Sections 4 and 5 ),
means that there is a double, compounded effect on improving pri-
mary energy utilization. Additionally, while it does produce hydro-
carbon emissions at a similar level to gasoline (albeit of different
species), its combustion characteristics and single-carbon-molecule
nature mean that its emissions of oxides of nitrogen and particu-
late matter are significantly lower than for complex hydrocarbon
fuels. Hence, it has potential advantages from energy security, sus-
tainability and air quality viewpoints, all with no real upper limit
on scale. This latter point is the case when production techniques
using renewable energy and direct air capture of CO
2 are consid-
ered as a means of providing inputs to a closed carbon cycle (see
Section 1.4 ).

Methanol has many desirable attributes which make it an ex-
cellent spark-ignition engine fuel. These include (see Tables 1 and
2 ):

• High heat of vaporization (‘latent heat’)
• Low stoichiometric air-fuel ratio (AFR)
• High specific energy ratio (i.e., energy per unit of fuel-air mix-

ture)

• High flame speed
• High molar expansion ratio
• Low combustion temperature
• High hydrogen-to-carbon ratio
• Being liquid at standard temperature and pressure (STP)

All of these will be discussed further, but two important char-
acteristics are that first, it can be extremely clean burning; as men-
tioned later, methanol has been used as a fuel for air quality rea-
sons. Having a single carbon atom it cannot easily form the car-
bonaceous particulate matter common from long-chain hydrocar-
bons (a characteristic it shares with methane). Second, methanol
is the simplest carbonaceous molecule that is liquid at STP. This
makes it easy to store and transport with minimal losses on the
vehicle and in the fuel infrastructure. Methanol is liquid at STP be-
cause of the hydrogen bonding phenomenon arising from its OH
characteristic group, as explained in more detail in Section 2.1 .

Also advantageous is that methanol is not a mixture of com-
pounds  of  which  the  properties  can  change  depending  on  the
source, as is the case with gasoline, diesel, kerosene etc. Methanol
consists  of  just  one  molecule  and  as  such  it  is  easier  to  simu-
late/optimize the process for.

Before  subsequent  sections  discuss  methanol’s  combustion
properties and performance as engine fuel, the following subsec-
tions provide background on:

• The various uses of methanol as an engine fuel, from the be-

ginning of the 20th century up to today ( Section 1.2 )

• Current production of methanol ( Section 1.3 )

First however, we briefly discuss the use of methanol, CH

versus that of ethanol, C

5 OH.

1.1. Methanol versus ethanol

Methanol  and  ethanol  are  both  simple  molecules 1 .  Methanol
shares  many  attributes  with  ethanol,  particularly  in  combustion
systems. These are driven by their similar octane numbers, very
high  heats  of  vaporization  and  low  stoichiometric  air-fuel  ratios
(although the latter two differ by more than the former). As a con-
sequence of this plus the fact that (due to its increasing popularity
and use as a biofuel) there is often more recent data on the per-
formance of ethanol in engines, in this paper we use ethanol as an
analogue for methanol where we consider it robust to do so, in or-
der to estimate the effects of methanol. This is further supported
by the fact that the similarity of the two molecules means that
they also lend themselves to being blended together with gasoline
and there are blending rules which essentially mean that drop-in
fuels can be created 2 (see Section 1.6.2 ).

While  its  similarity  to  ethanol  is  useful  when  attempting  to
predict how methanol will perform in combustion systems, there
is  a  difference  which  may  prove  very  useful  in  terms  of  green-
house gas mitigation. Methanol is conventionally made from fossil
sources (usually either by steam reformation or from coal, which
2  impact)  but  since  it  can  be
in  itself  has  a  significant  fossil  CO
made from anything containing carbon by thermochemical means,
it is possible that - unlike ethanol - it could be manufactured from
biogenic feedstocks. Since chemical processes are generally signif-
icantly more rapid than biological ones, this has the potential to
increase  production  rates  [3,4] .  Also,  the  difficulties  surrounding
bioethanol production from non-food crops - such as lignocellu-
losic processes - are bypassed with this approach, and with this
the feedstock limitations in terms of type and quantity. As a con-
sequence methanol production is potentially more easily scalable
and could also be incorporated with bioethanol plants in order to
increase the overall energy yield from the feedstock entering the
process [5] .

1.2. Historical use of methanol as an engine fuel

From the early days of the spark ignition engine, means to ex-
tend  what  is  now  referred  to  as  the  octane  rating  of  fuels  was
sought,  and  the  early  development  of  octane  enhancers  such  as
aniline compounds and ultimately tetraethyl lead (TEL) was begun.
Boyd discusses early concerns that oil would run out in the 1920s
and the consequent effort s to increase engine efficiency to reduce
consumption via improved knock resistance of refined fuels in this
regard [6] . Interestingly, he states that “butyl alcohol [butanol] did
not knock in any of the engines they had then”, referring to en-
gines available in the 1920s; demonstrating that the attractiveness
of alcohols as knock-resistant fuels was apparent very early on.

As is already known since the search for a scale for a fuel’s au-
toignition resistance [7,8] , isomerization is an important parame-
ter. Isomerization of long-chain alkanes has the potential to hold
octane  numbers  (ONs)  in  the  region  of  100.  However,  the  same
is  true  of  simple  molecules.  Fig.  1  shows  the  values  of  research
octane  number  (RON)  taken  from  several  sources  for  saturated
molecules versus the number of carbon atoms contained. Immedi-
ately apparent in the figure is that, with normal alkane molecules,
as  the  chain  lengthens  so  the  knock  resistance  drops  markedly.
Conversely,  if  the  molecule  can  be  heavily  isomerized  then  the
RON stays high - broadly constant at around 100. Note that the

Methanol and ethanol are the simplest alcohols and are usually referred to as
the ‘light’ alcohols. They are also known as methyl alcohol and ethyl alcohol, re-
spectively.

Drop-in blends for gasoline, however, are limited to low concentrations of alco-
hols. Higher concentrations require engine modifications such as for E85 use. This
will be explained in detail in later sections.

Fig. 1.  Effect of isomerization on octane numbers of various families of chemicals. Isomerization can maintain the ON of alkanes at approximately 100. Alcohols generally
have higher ONs, and are the only family to be liquid at STP with four or fewer carbon atoms present

simple alcohols methanol and ethanol are also very highly knock
resistant in their own right, which can be attributed to the absence
of NTC behaviour as explained in Section 2.5 . As the normal carbon
backbone of the alcohol lengthens so the knock resistance drops,
and this can be recovered in the same way as for the other fami-
lies by isomerization. Nevertheless the inherently high ON of alco-
hol molecules is apparent, and it is worth noting that they are the
only family shown with carbon numbers lower than four which are
liquid at standard temperature and pressure (STP), a factor which
makes them sensible fuels.

The  performance-enhancing  attributes  of  both  ethanol  and
methanol were realized early on in motor racing. Blends contain-
ing  methanol  and  benzene  were  often  used  in  Grand  Prix  cars,
especially  as  supercharging  was  developed  as  a  tool  to  extract

maximum  performance  from  a  given  engine  swept  volume  (and
charge  cooling  was  not  widely  used).  Among  others  Alfa  Romeo
and Bugatti used such mixtures in their pre-war Grand Prix cars
[9] . While the presence of methanol caused a reduction in volu-
metric energy content (see Section 2 ), with fuel introduction be-
fore the supercharger its high latent heat cooled the charge as it
was compressed, while its high octane number supported that of
the benzene proportion (whose density helped to offset the dele-
terious effect of methanol in terms of volumetric energy content).
Aviation also represented an arena where methanol was used
for its benefits in terms of ON and latent heat, but only on take-
off and to an extent when maximum power was required. Energy
density  is  an  overriding  consideration  for  aircraft  propulsion,  so
straight hydrocarbon fuels were mostly used in highly-boosted air-

48

S. Verhelst et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 70 (2019) 43–88

craft engines. However, at take-off maximum performance is re-
quired at sea level, and supplementary mixtures of methanol and
water were used as a knock suppressant, injected with the main
fuel into the compressor entry. This meant that minimal amounts
of the ‘anti-detonant injection’ (ADI) fluid had to be carried, mini-
mizing its effect on aircraft mass. The volume ratio between water
and methanol in ADI was usually 50:50. As well as supplying some
chemical availability, the methanol also helped to stop the water
freezing at altitude.

In many ways this approach foreshadowed the so-called octane
on demand (OOD) approach, where beyond the knock limit of the
main fuel an octane booster is introduced [10–16] . This is not a
new  concept,  the  potential  for  both  methanol  or  ethanol  as  oc-
tane boosters to a lower-quality main fuel having been understood
very early on [17] . Both have often been used for this function, but
the approach requires dual fuel systems, and therefore (together
with the requirement to blend the octane booster in with load) in-
creases complexity and cost aboard the vehicle. This subject will
be returned to in Section 4.4 .

The simplicity of a single fuel approach is arguably one of the
reasons why the current model of IC engine and hydrocarbon fuel
has become dominant in transport. However, flex-fuel approaches
- where a single fuel system is retained, but the control system
can optimize for any proportion of two fuels which can be mixed
in any ratio in the fuel tank [18] - are almost as cheap to apply
as proved by the US vehicle manufacturer’s response to the Cor-
porate  Average  Fuel  Economy  (CAFE)  regulations  put  in  place  to
increase the efficiency of their products. Here many vehicles capa-
ble of operating on any mixture of gasoline and E85 3 in the fuel
tank were sold to customers at no increase in list price over the
gasoline-only equivalent. This was done because the fiscal benefit
of selling the cars in terms of CAFE credits outweighed the cost of
producing them. Flex-fuel operation with E85 was seen as advan-
tageous since the US could make first-generation ethanol in large
quantities (i.e. from corn). The vehicle technology was already de-
veloped as well, since the methanol equivalent of E85 – M85 – had
already been proven to be practical in the California methanol fuel
trial in the 1980s and 1990s; in reality, gasoline-ethanol flex-fuel
capability was developed and fully proven first for methanol.

The California methanol fuel trial was driven primarily by air
quality  considerations,  methanol  causing  significantly  lower  un-
burned hydrocarbon (UHC) and oxides of nitrogen (NO
X ) emissions
than typical gasolines in use at the time. During it, 15,0 0 0 M85-
gasoline  flex-fuel  vehicles,  ranging  from  light-duty  to  buses  and
trucks, were sold and operated by Californians of all background
- no specific training in their use was required [19–21] . On a tech-
nical level it was completely successful, and furthermore, the toxi-
city of methanol (see Section 1.5 ) was not found to be an issue at
all. Its eventual failure was related to air quality, but only insofar
as in order to achieve a similar level of such quality with gasoline
the California Air Resources Board (CARB) mandated the use of re-
formulated gasoline 4 , and the methanol previously being used as
fuel in the trial was diverted to make MTBE, a completely different
molecule.

Ironically there then followed ground water contamination is-
sues since MTBE forms very long plumes when it leaks from tanks
(as  happened  with  the  old  infrastructure  in  place)  and,  since  it
was made from methanol, it gave the alcohol a completely unde-

E85 is notionally 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline by volume, although the pro-
portions (and formulation) of the gasoline is often varied for reasons of cold starta-
bility etc. Conventionally, ‘EXX’ refers to XX% by volume ethanol in bulk gasoline;
the analogue situation for methanol is to use ‘MXX’.

Note that the EPA reported testing of a number of vehicles on different fuels
and found that emissions when running on M85 had a lower ozone forming poten-
tial than reformulated gasoline [22] .

served bad name solely by association. Methanol (and ethanol) are
actually simply biodegradable and do not cause any environmen-
tal issues as opposed to MTBE [23] . Note that MTBE is still widely
used as an octane-boosting gasoline additive in Europe [1] , where
fuel infrastructure is modern, and with no issues. It is furthermore
ironic that the technology developed for the California M85 trial
was simply modified for its analogue with ethanol, and forms the
basis of all flex-fuel vehicles today [20] . In itself this illustrates how
simple and robust the provision of alcohol/gasoline flex-fuelling is.
Ethanol flex-fuelling has had a long history in Brazil, and ar-
guably even more (but still affordable) sophisticated vehicle tech-
nology  has  been  evolved  there  to  cater  for  the  wide  variety  of
blends offered. For the Brazilian market OEMs also developed tech-
nologies not generally seen elsewhere: for example, starting sys-
tems which use gasoline before switching over to ethanol once the
engine is warm enough; this technology has also been adopted in
parts of China for the analogue case of M100 fuelled cars.

China’s  take  up  of  a  methanol  transport  economy  has  been
driven  by  various  factors,  not  least  being  the  stipulation  that  in
order  to  gain  valuable  coal  mining  permits  companies  have  to
provide  a  use  for  that  coal;  this  has  led  to  the  construction  of
mega methanol plants since methanol is easily made from gasi-
fied coal [24] . In turn, and related to China’s reliance on imported
oil, methanol has been promoted in various provinces, particularly
those  rich  in  coal.  This  has  led  to  the  establishment  of  various
regional and national methanol fuel standards. So much low cost
methanol  is  available  that  adulteration  of  gasoline  with  the  al-
cohol  is  common.  These  factors  have  led  to  the  development of
methanol-gasoline flex-fuel vehicles. Pure M100 vehicles are also
available, and research is under way to understand how future leg-
islation should evolve with regards to the exhaust emissions from
such vehicles [25] .

While  in  general  Western  OEMs  show  little  enthusiasm  for
methanol  as  a  transport  fuel 5 ,  the  sheer  magnitude  of  the  Chi-
nese market and the fact that many have partnerships with Chi-
nese companies in order to access it means that methanol fueling
for light-duty is well understood by global OEMs. While methanol
2 emissions (over
from coal is very poor in terms of well-to-tank CO
four times worse at 124.7 g CO
2 -e/MJ for
natural gas [11] ), it is argued that the driving of the technology for
methanol usage by the Chinese economy will reduce demand-side
barriers to decarbonizing the fleet via the fuel as the technology to
reduce the carbon intensity of the methanol supplied develops.

2 -e/MJ versus 28.6 g CO

Thus  it  can  be  seen  that  the  light  alcohols  ethanol  and
methanol have been used and understood as transport fuels for al-
most as long as the motor vehicle has been around, and that the
vehicle technology to employ them is well understood. Worldwide
use of ethanol at up to 85% blend rate was shown to be straight-
forward, and at low blend rates it is becoming increasingly com-
mon. The technically successful fleet trial in California showed that
there were no real barriers to the introduction of methanol at high
blend rates. Its use in China, for different reasons, has shown the
same thing. On a vehicle level there are therefore no real technical
reasons why these fuels should not be adopted more widely.

The interest in methanol as a fuel is currently picking up also
in  regions  outside  of  China.  The  strongest  drive  currently  seems
to be in the marine sector, as discussed in Section 5.3 . It is also
increasingly being used as a blend component, added to gasoline
together with ethanol. This is being demonstrated in Israel [26] ,
Australia [27] and in the Junior World Rally Championship which
holds races across Europe [28] .

Likely due to a reluctance to undertake extra calibration effort and a division
of labour at a time when hybridization and the development of battery electric
vehicles is being encouraged by governments as a means of ensuring compliance
with tailpipe CO 2 legislation.

Moreover,  the  light  alcohols  and  methanol  in  particular  can
improve  vehicle  performance  and  efficiency  markedly  over  con-
ventional  gasoline  formulations.  This  subject  will  be  discussed
throughout this paper.

1.3. Existing infrastructure/production capacity

One  of  the  advantages  of  methanol  is  that  there  is  already
fairly large scale production capacity and infrastructure in place.
Methanol  is  one  of  the  most  widely  used  chemicals,  as  stated
above, with 70 million metric tons produced in 2015 and a global
production  capacity  of  about  110  million  metric  tons  [29]  (note
global gasoline production in 2012 was roughly one billion met-
ric tons). One of its uses is to support the petrochemical industry:
it can be used to make many other chemicals via the methanol-to-
olefins process and from these higher plastics etc. [24,30] .

As a consequence of this it is one of the most widely shipped
chemicals around the globe, and due to the fact that it is also a fuel
its shipment in large volume is driving the development of ma-
rine engines to use it, which is discussed in Section 5.3 . Regional
coal  mining  permits  have  driven  the  construction  of  very  large
methanol  production  capacity  in  China;  there  is  already  enough
installed  capacity  to  provide  half  of  China’s  road  transport  fuel
needs [24] . US methanol capacity more than doubled in 2015, with
prices coming down as cheap natural gas from shale rock became
increasingly available, resulting in the US displacing China as the
world’s low cost methanol producer [1] . To put things in perspec-
tive, a large oil refinery typically processes about 50 0,0 0 0 barrels
of  crude  oil  per  day.  A  large  methanol  production  facility  today
produces about 20,0 0 0 barrels of methanol per day.

2 and CO

Bozzano and Manenti have recently reviewed the production of
methanol [31] , explaining how current production comprises three
basic steps. The first is the production of synthesis gas (syngas), a
mixture of CO, H
2 . The most common syngas production
is by reforming of natural gas, but it can also be obtained from
other carbon-based materials, be they fossil or renewable. The sec-
ond step is the conversion of the syngas to methanol. Bozzano and
Manenti review the different processes currently used on an indus-
trial scale, and those in development aimed at lowering the tem-
perature and pressure requirement for the synthesis reaction. They
expect innovation in reactor technology, and heat removal and re-
covery, to further improve the overall process’s energy efficiency,
which they state is currently of the order of 75%. The final step is
distillation. As mentioned above, methanol is a polar molecule, as
is water. Consequently methanol is infinitely miscible with water
and can also absorb water from the atmosphere. Most of the pro-
duction processes for methanol result in a crude methanol contain-
ing residual gases and a significant amount of water. Thus, distilla-
tion becomes an inevitable step to obtain high grade methanol. The
dehydration step accounts for an important part of the overall cost
of production, both in terms of capital and operating costs. There-
fore it would be interesting, from an economic point of view, to
use hydrous, or ‘raw’ methanol and reduce or avoid the dehydra-
tion process. A second incentive to investigate hydrous methanol
is  the  potential  of  increasing  the  engine  efficiency  by  means  of
the cooling effect of water. E.g. for hydrous ethanol (up to 7 wt%
water  content),  several  publications  [32–34]  pointed  out  that  it
can be used as an efficient fuel. The properties of methanol-water
blends are discussed in Section 2.7 with the effect on engine op-
eration  elaborated  in  Section  4.3 .  Implications  on  storage  when
methanol is intended to be blended into gasoline are discussed in
Section 2.8.6 .

Importantly, methanol forms no azeotrope with water. This is
unique among the alcohols, which means that the extra process
energy required to dry them beyond an azeotrope is absent. Con-
versely ethanol forms a minimum boiling azeotrope at a composi-

tion of 95.6% of ethanol and 4.4% of water; distillation under pres-
sure or a vacuum, or the use of chemical sieves are required to dry
the ethanol fully and these processes are costly and increase its
carbon footprint. For a quantification of the distillation cost, vari-
ous parameters such as water content of the crude methanol must
be taken into account. The water content itself highly depends on
the  production  process.  When,  for  example,  methanol  is  formed
2  (see Section 1.4 ),
with renewable hydrogen and atmospheric CO
the reaction is theoretically:

CO 2 + 3 H 2 → CH 3 OH + H 2 O

(1)

I.e. per mole of methanol, there is a mole of water. Note that cur-
rent methanol production is directed primarily at supplying neat
methanol to the chemical industry and therefore crude methanol
is not available on the market today.

1.4. Renewable production of methanol

The light alcohols make excellent spark-ignition fuels, but one
of the reasons that ethanol became so popular as a potential re-
placement  was  that  it  is  capable  of  being  manufactured  renew-
ably. As discussed earlier, Brazil originally led the way on this. Such
bioethanol, made from food stuffs, is termed ‘first generation’, and
issues of ‘food versus fuel’ quickly became prevalent on its intro-
duction in other markets. Additionally, there were issues of indirect
land  use  change  (ILUC)  and  conversion  of  land  to  agriculture  to
2 .
manufacture biofuels causing release of naturally-sequestered CO
Consequently, first generation bioethanol only really works as
a mass transportation fuel in Brazil, where a combination of rel-
atively low population density, climate and the ensuing efficiency
of sugar cane production make it a very desirable energy carrier. In
contrast bioethanol from corn in the US is more energy intensive
and on a life-cycle basis its return on energy investment is signif-
icantly lower [35] . In Europe the land area for ethanol production
sufficient to provide all the required energy for transport cannot
be found [36] . As a consequence of all of these issues, much em-
phasis has been put on second and third generation ethanol. Here
lignin and cellulose - the waste, inedible parts of the crop - are
broken  down  before  fermentation.  This  holds  out  the  hope  that
much  greater  yields  of  ethanol  can  be  achieved  without  disrup-
tion in the food chain. The US has enacted legislation mandating
the use of such lignocellulosic ethanol in gasoline to ever greater
degrees, with a target of a total of 36 billion US gallons of ethanol
from all sources being produced indigenously for use in the US fuel
pool by 2022 [37] . Whether this can be achieved is open to ques-
tion.

Methanol was traditionally made from wood, hence one of its
common names, ‘wood alcohol’ (ethanol has similarly historically
been termed ‘corn alcohol’). However, being the simplest alcohol
and  readily  synthesized  from  any  carbonaceous  stock,  methanol
can be made by gasifying waste and using thermochemical (rather
than  biological)  processes.  In  this  respect  the  energetic  yield  is
higher, interference with the food chain can be avoided, and the
process is faster. Historically it was also made by BioMCN in The
Netherlands using glycerin, itself a byproduct of the esterification
of biodiesel, as a feedstock. Since methanol itself is used to ester-
ify biodiesel in the first place, this permitted a gradual reduction in
the fossil footprint of the methanol produced by this process. Oth-
ers  have  proposed  and  studied  combined  ethanol/methanol  pro-
duction plants, the energetic yield of which would be high and the
carbon footprint low [5] . Bergins et al. [38] describe existing indus-
trial sources of hydrogen and carbon dioxide and how to use these
for methanol synthesis.

Although the production of methanol from biomass and waste
has definite potential, scaling up sustainable methanol production
to meet transportation demands needs a production method that

goes beyond these feedstocks. Sustainable fuels can also be pro-
duced using electricity from renewables and atoms harvested from
the atmosphere. It is contended that fuels that can be synthesized
using electricity should perhaps be termed ‘electrofuels’ since they
represent a means to store energy gathered and transmissible us-
ing this medium [39] . As mentioned, methanol can be made from
anything  carbonaceous,  via  chemical  processes  which  synthesize
the molecule from carbon, oxygen and hydrogen atoms. Methanol
is thus the simplest liquid electrofuel and an excellent hydrogen
carrier. In fact, as Fig. 2 shows, per unit volume, methanol contains
40% more hydrogen than liquid hydrogen (LH
2 ), without the issues
of required energy input for storage, which are severe for molecu-
lar hydrogen as discussed by the US Department of Energy (DoE)
[40] . Since liquid hydrogen has about twice the density as 700 bar
hydrogen, these observations also apply to that alternative storage
method.

In fact, Gardiner’s data shows that the magnitude of the energy
input  required  to  make  hydrogen  storable  by  the  methods  pro-
posed is of the order of that which it takes to synthesize methanol
on a per-unit-energy basis (expressed as a fraction of the lower
heating  value,  about  21%  for  LH
2 ).  The
DoE document also states that for 700 bar storage on board a ve-
hicle the gas will have to be delivered at 880 bar and precooled
to -40 °C because of the heating it undergoes in the refilling pro-
cess. Methanol is therefore an attractive alternative hydrogen stor-
age medium in the form of its chemical liquefaction.

2  and  10%  for  700  bar  H

The above logic applies to any suitable and synthesizable hydro-
carbon, which is the rationale behind so-called power-to-gas (PTG),
proposed by Specht and co-workers and supported by Audi [41] .
Here, renewable hydrogen is fixed to waste CO
2 - in the case of the
Audi process this is taken from a biogas plant - to form methane,
and this is put into the gas grid. Because of the magnitude of the
gas storage and distribution network for many countries this pro-
vides a means of storing renewable energy which can help to al-
leviate the ‘wrong-time renewables’ problem. For example Specht
et al. state that in Germany the storage represented by the gas grid
could supply the average output during 20 0 0 hours, whereas the
electricity grid could only do so for 0.6 h.. For automotive use nat-
ural gas is removed from the grid and put into cars with a typical
storage pressure of 200 bar and replenished by renewable methane
synthesized at the plant.

Fig. 3.  Energy storage capacity of various fuels in terms of amount of energy stored
per unit mass or volume, including the storage vessel (reproduced from [276] ).

As  Fig.  3  shows,  methane  compressed  to  200  bar  has  essen-
tially the same energy storage capacity in an automotive storage
system (i.e. when the mass or volume of the storage medium is
also taken into account for automotive applications) as hydrogen
compressed  to  700  bar;  liquid  hydrogen  is  worse  than  700  bar
hydrogen  in  terms  of  its  net  volumetric  energy.  The  challenges
of  manufacturing  a  liquid  hydrogen  storage  tank  were  discussed
by Amaseder and Krainz [42] ; the problem of liquid hydrogen for
transport is one that is arguably best served by scale, which is why,
for instance, liquid hydrogen can be practically used in space trans-
portation. Bossel and co-workers discuss the challenges of molec-
ular hydrogen as an energy vector for road transport in some de-
tail, including the number of extra fuel tankers that would be re-
quired were the current model for fuel distribution to be continued
for  hydrogen,  and  the  implications  for  upstream  energy  if  these
tankers were fueled by hydrogen themselves (as would have to be
the case for a zero-carbon realization of the molecular hydrogen
economy) [43,44] .

Ethanol  is  included  in  Fig.  2  because  of  its  renewable  na-
ture,  and  also  isooctane  because,  if  higher  hydrocarbon  electro-
fuels could be synthesized from renewable carbon and hydrogen,
then the data shows that they have similar hydrogen mass storage
capability to methane (as might be expected since they are both
fully saturated hydrocarbons). It is interesting that such hydrocar-

S. Verhelst et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 70 (2019) 43–88

51

bons have similar hydrogen mass concentrations to water. Ammo-
nia has also been included in Fig. 2 because historically it too has
been proposed as an electrofuel, due to the ease with which its
other  major  constituent,  nitrogen, can  be  extracted  from  the  at-
mosphere [45] ; such an approach was proposed during the 1960s
by the US military, with the supplied energy to have come from a
mobile Compact Military Reactor in the theatre of operation.

Of the fuels shown in Figs. 2 and 3 , methanol is the simplest
molecule that is liquid at standard temperature and pressure (STP).
If sufficient waste CO
2  can be obtained then using it to convert
hydrogen to an electrofuel provides a means to break the biomass
limit suffered by ethanol, butanol and biodiesel for example. Us-
2  represents an effectively limitless source of
ing air-extracted CO
carbon that can be used for this process, as proposed by Steinberg
and Olah among others as the “methanol economy” [23,30,46–49] .
Thus, methanol is also being advanced as one of the most in-
teresting energy carriers in “PtX” schemes, power-to-x, with x de-
noting a fuel. These schemes support the development of renew-
able energy production by allowing large scale energy storage and
buffering, producing a storable energy carrier when there is excess
renewable energy so this can later be used at times when there is
insufficient power from renewables. Renewable methanol produc-
tion is starting, with the Carbon Recycling International plant in
Iceland being the best known example. Being the simplest electro-
fuel that is liquid at STP results in methanol being the cheapest
liquid electrofuel that can be produced [50] .

The high value of energy and the ease with which liquids can
be transported makes the concept attractive, especially since the
main inputs to the process - renewable energy and the two feed-
stocks  CO
2  and  hydrogen  -  are  effectively  limitless,  or  at  least
are not subject to price control by humans. Once a plant is built
then theoretically only maintenance costs have to be offset against
the high value of the fuel it would continuously manufacture. It
should be noted that this also represents a way to provide carbon-
neutral chemical feedstocks to the petrochemical industry via the
methanol-to-olefins  (MTO)  process  for  instance,  and  that  should
such methanol be used the whole process can be made carbon-
negative since the resulting plastics and paints, made ultimately
from CO
2 originally extracted from the atmosphere, effectively se-
questrate the carbon they contain.

Regardless of whether mass electrification of light-duty trans-
portation  is  successful  in  the  long  term,  electrofuels  may  be
needed to decarbonize some or all of the remaining forms of trans-
port that cannot be served by the adoption of batteries. Aviation,
shipping and long-distance haulage of goods represent significant
challenges for  decarbonization, with  varying levels of  imperative
associated  with  energy  density,  quantity  of  energy  to  be  stored
and speed of refueling. Plainly at present these requirements are
met by liquid fuels so decarbonization of these would facilitate a
decarbonized endgame without fundamental changes being neces-
sary to the machinery already in place. France et al. [51] discuss
recent methods to create higher hydrocarbons from CO
2  and hy-
drogen either with or without methanol as part of the direct path-
way.

Clearly methanol has the potential to play an important role in
future transport systems as an intermediate hydrogen carrier for
renewable energy distribution and storage, but many workers have
investigated its use as a blend component as its own right. Later
sections in this paper will discuss this approach.

1.5. Health and safety

Despite of their interesting beneficial properties the use of light
alcohols as fuels has met with resistance due to toxicological and
fire  safety  concerns.  This  is  particularly  the  case  for  methanol.
Pearson  and  Turner  [49]  and  Bromberg  et  al.  [52]  reviewed  the

safety  aspects  of  methanol  and  ethanol  and  concluded  that  al-
though both alcohols are dangerous and toxic agents, this is true
for all fuels being considered as gasoline and diesel substitutes. In
many respects alcohols can actually be regarded safer than gaso-
line, which was also a conclusion reached for methanol in studies
by Machiele for the US Environmental Protection Agency [53,54] .

The major issue alcohols - and especially methanol - have to
face is toxicity both in terms of ingestion, skin or eye contact or
inhalation. Although it is readily metabolized in small amounts by
the human body, on account of it being found naturally in fruit
and vegetables and therefore not rejected by the body as an alien
substance, methanol toxicity arises as a result of overloading the
digestive system. When this occurs, the concentration of the toxic
intermediary products formaldehyde and formic acid becomes too
high, and this is what causes damage:

CH 3 OH

→  HCHO

→  HCOOH

→

CO 2 + H 2 O

(methanol)

(formaldehyde)

(formic acid)

Reported fatal doses when untreated are between 1 and 2 ml
per  kg  body  weight.  This  would  correspond  to  60-240  ml  for
a  typical  range  of  body  weights  [53] .  Note  that  Gable  reported
that a fatal dose for ethanol is only about twice as much as for
methanol (350-577 ml for ethanol, depending on body mass and
metabolism, and 115-470 ml for methanol) [55] . Gasoline is simi-
larly toxic although the toxicity of gasoline results from different
reasons. Symptoms of acute methanol poisoning from direct inges-
tion include dizziness, nausea, respiratory problems, coma and fi-
nally death. However, the process takes between 10 and 48 hours
after ingestion and the cure is well understood, consisting of in-
travenous administration of ethanol, which the body preferentially
metabolizes while the methanol is ejected. Accidental ingestion of
methanol or ethanol can be avoided by appropriate design of fuel
dispensing systems and by making the fuel completely unpalatable
to  human  taste  through  additives  such  as  denatonium  benzoate
(marketed  as  ‘Bitrex’  [56] ).  Skin  or  eye  contact  with  methanol,
as well as inhalation of methanol vapours are generally of much
lower concern, as long as it does not persist for hours. The results
of  animal  tests  to  determine  the  toxicity  of  various  fuels  by  in-
halation, oral and dermal contact have shown that the toxicity of
alcohol fuels is comparable, and in many cases better than that of
common gasoline or diesel [52] .

With  regard  to  fire  safety,  methanol  shows  clear  advantages
over gasoline. It is not readily ignitable below 10 °C, and Machiele
reports  that  it  has  a  similar  flammability  index  to  diesel  [54] .
When compared to gasoline, it has a lower volatility, vapour den-
sity and heat release rate in a pool fire, the latter being about 11%
that of gasoline. It also requires a greater concentration to form
a  combustible  mixture  in  air  (cfr.  Table  3 ).  A  significant  hazard
is  that  methanol  flames  are  practically  invisible  in  sunlight,  but
this can be addressed through additives or the use of methanol-
gasoline blends, although Machiele shows that blending 15% gaso-
line into methanol halves the difference in the flammability index
of the two. This, of course, underlines the primary safety difficulty
of gasoline. An advantage of methanol, however, is that thanks to
its miscibility, pure methanol fires can be extinguished with water.
The inherent fire safety factors of methanol were the primary rea-
sons why neat methanol was the fuel of choice for Indianapolis-
style racing in the US for decades until it was replaced by E85.
Note that, as discussed in more detail in Section 2.1 , the minimum
ignition energy of methanol is lower than gasoline.

Methanol has gained a negative reputation when it comes to
groundwater  contamination  through  its  association  with  MTBE,
which is made from it.  Thus,  the connection is not a valid one.
MTBE  is  often  used  as  an  octane  enhancer  for  gasoline,  and  is
known to form long plumes if it gets into the soil, as has happened

with leaking fuel storage tanks. It also has a very strong taste, and
for this reason its use is banned in the US. In reality, unlike MTBE,
methanol and ethanol do not form long plumes and are biodegrad-
able on a very short timescale (a few days) and their spills mostly
self-clean [52] . This rapid biodegradation property also makes the
light alcohols attractive as marine fuels, since any spill quickly dis-
perses  due  to  their  infinite  solubility  in  water,  and  then  biode-
grades simply; this contrasts sharply with the consequences of a
hydrocarbon fuel spillage in the marine environment.

As  a  consequence  of  the  above,  widespread  methanol  usage
would be expected to lead to a reduction in deaths, fires and prop-
erty loss in the region of 90-95% versus gasoline [23,54] . Finally, it
should be noted that during the Californian M85 trial, which lasted
for several years and involved 15,0 0 0 vehicles being used by the
general public without special training in the refuelling or use of
gasoline/methanol flex-fuel vehicles, not a single issue of toxicity
was reported [19] . This is clear empirical proof that methanol fuels
can be deployed safely in the market.

1.6. Methods of using methanol as an engine fuel

There are several ways to use methanol as an engine fuel:

• In SI engines: Principally methanol is considered an SI engine
fuel, due to its high autoignition resistance and also high heat
of  vaporization  (see  Section  2.1 ).  Methanol  can  be  used  as  a
pure fuel or as a blend component. The modifications neces-
sary for SI operation are not too significant, see Section 3 . The
fact that it condenses at low temperatures can also mean that
changes to operational parameters need to be performed, but
nevertheless  significant  numbers  of  gasoline/alcohol  flex-fuel
engines have been built and operated around the world. Results
obtained on SI engines operated on pure methanol or methanol
blends are reported in Section 4 .

• In CI engines: Alcohols have also been used in diesel applica-
tions but require more significant modifications from the norm
in  that  application,  again  a  corollary  of  their  high  autoigni-
tion  resistance.  Dual-fuelling  has  also  been  adopted,  recently
in large ship engines such as the Stena Germanica, where the
methanol is introduced separately to the diesel which is then
used as a source of ignition. This obviously requires some sig-

nificant modification to the fuelling system, but fortunately this
is largely common with LNG conversions of such engines. Port-
fuel  injection  of  the  methanol  is  a  possibility  in  these  dual-
fuel  engines,  too,  and  is  being  investigated  particularly  as  a
means of providing improved emissions in water craft. The use
of methanol in CI engines is discussed in detail in Section 5 .
• In  SI  engines,  as  a  separate  fuel  stream:  As  mentioned,  it  is
possible  to  use  an  octane-on-demand  approach  where  alco-
hols are used as an octane booster and introduced separately
to  gasoline,  and  only  when  the  knock  avoidance  afforded  by
their high octane numbers and charge cooling effect is required.
Thus  increased  compression  ratio  or  engine  downsizing  can
be  provided,  and  with  them  an  improvement  in  vehicle  en-
ergy  consumption.  Ideally  the  overall  alcohol  consumption  is
lower than if they were blended in a monofuel approach, but
there  is  clearly  increased  complication  on  an  engine  and  ve-
hicle  level  due  to  having  to  provided  two  fuel  systems  and
a  concomitantly  more  sophisticated  engine  management  sys-
tem. With improved gasoline consumption the ‘gearing effect’
of the available alcohol is higher. This approach is elaborated in
Section 4.4 .

The following two sections will explain the background for why
using binary and ternary blends containing methanol offer attrac-
tive possibilities.

1.6.1. Binary alcohol blends

The blending of alcohols into automotive fuels has been under-
taken for many years, particularly in Brazil, and arguably the first
significant use of methanol as a blend component was during the
Californian methanol fuel trial, both of which have been discussed
above. Since the Californian M85 trial there has been a steady in-
crease in the amount of ethanol blended into US gasoline, driven
by energy security concerns. During recent years the Corporate Av-
erage Fuel Economy (CAFE) regulations raised on vehicle OEMs in
the US has driven the sale of E85/gasoline flex-fuel cars, since es-
sentially the fuel consumption associated with the ethanol in the
fuel is ignored as far as the reportable fuel consumption is con-
cerned. In fact the M85 and E85 situations in the US are linked
because the technology for the former was easily transplanted to
the latter, as discussed by Nichols [20] , who also stated that the

53

original Ford M85 development vehicles could operate on any mix-
ture of gasoline, ethanol and methanol in their fuel tanks; this will
be returned to later.

The nominally 15% by volume gasoline in these blends serves
to denature the alcohol to prevent ingestion, to provide a more ig-
nitable mixture (which is particularly important at low tempera-
tures) and also to provide a more visible flame should a vehicle
fire occur.

The OEM use of flex-fuel vehicle (FFV) technology to meet the
CAFE regulations also serves to highlight how cheap it is to apply
in a real marketplace. Contrary to the electric vehicle market at
present, it works in a marketplace operating without government
subsidy and as it is effectively ‘hidden’ from the public it has a dis-
proportionately large number of early-adopting consumers. Many
E85/gasoline vehicles were sold without the purchasers being told
of this capability; this demonstrates that the technology was, at
point of sale, effectively a zero-cost one, since such purchasers be-
lieved they were buying gasoline-only vehicles at that price point.
Alcohol blending can take the form of low-, mid- and high-level
blends, for which there is no formal definition, but which Turner
et al. considered to be up to 15% by volume (low), 15-30% (mid)
and  over  30%  by  volume  (high)  [57] .  Israel  recently  adopted  an
M15 standard [58] . Low ethanol blends are common in the US and
Europe now, typically at 10%, with the US Environmental Protec-
tion Agency (EPA) investigating an increase to 15% for air quality
reasons with waivers for more modern vehicles. Up to this level
of concentration the changes in the gasoline distillation curve that
ethanol causes can be mitigated by changes to the bulk hydrocar-
bon components. However, the vehicle OEMs will have to make in-
creased calibration efforts to make their products effectively flex-
fuel to accept fuels whose oxygenate concentration could vary sig-
nificantly from zero to proportions of 15% and higher; the swing
in stoichiometric air-fuel ratio obviously becomes greater the more
ethanol is blended in (nominally reducing from 14.7 for gasoline to
13.8 for E15).

Accordingly, there are considerations being given to increasing
the octane number of the fuel as the ethanol concentration is in-
creased. The traditional approach taken by fuel suppliers to date
has  been  to  decontent  the  hydrocarbon  component  in  the  fuel
by using ethanol’s octane enhancing attributes to facilitate the re-
moval of high-octane components from the bulk hydrocarbon fuel,
as would be expected in the interest of greater financial return.
However, as Anderson et al. have shown, significant increases in
octane can be expected with relatively low volumes of ethanol ad-
dition and this can be satisfactorily estimated when the compo-
nents are considered as molar fractions [59] , see Section 2.8.4 .

Above say 15% ethanol by volume it becomes increasingly diffi-
cult to match a traditional gasoline distillation curve since the al-
cohol has a tendency to increase the vapour pressure due to the
fact that a gasoline-alcohol mixture does not follow Raoult’s Law
(see Section 2.8.3 ). Even at 15% waivers are being considered as
mentioned above. Nevertheless the fact that E85 vehicles could be
manufactured shows that the technology exists to overcome this
issue. This may be important since the optimal level of alcohol ad-
dition (at least as far as ethanol is concerned) is non-linear as far
as modern engine technology is concerned [60,61] .

Blending  alcohols  into  gasoline  tends  to  improve  engine  effi-
ciency (as evidenced in Section 4 ) and can be made to increase
fuel octane. However, vapour pressure can increase markedly and
under some situations there can be an increase in PN emissions.
However, countermeasures for the disadvantages exist and overall,
as far as engine performance and efficiency are concerned, there
are improvements as alcohol is blended in. However, the approach
of  blanket alcohol addition into bulk  gasoline arguably does  not
use the available volume to its maximum benefit, and several re-
searchers have investigated its use at variable proportions as an

octane  enhancer,  administered  when  needed  from  a  second  fuel
system. This will be discussed in Section 4.4 .

In the following Section, the potential of using both methanol

and ethanol as blend components in gasoline will be discussed.

1.6.2. Ternary blends

Although gasoline-alcohol blends are usually binary, more than
one alcohol can be used simultaneously. An example of this ap-
proach are so called ternary blends, which can for example com-
prise  gasoline,  ethanol  and  methanol  (so  called  GEM  blends).
Turner et al. [62–64] presented such a concept in which the sto-
ichiometric air-to-fuel ratio is controlled to be the same as that of
conventional E85 alcohol-based fuel. In fact, starting from any bi-
nary gasoline-ethanol mixture, a ternary blend of gasoline, ethanol
and methanol can be devised in which the fraction of each compo-
nent is chosen to yield the same stoichiometric air to fuel ratio (for
E85, this is ∼ 9 . 7 − 9 . 8 : 1 depending on the AFR of the gasoline
which can vary somewhat). E85 can be used in a flex-fuel vehi-
cle, which is capable of using ethanol in concentration levels of up
to 85% (E85) by volume. However, despite the registration of over
several million flex-fuel vehicles, representing 4% of the light duty
vehicle fleet in the United States, only 1% of the total ethanol use
in the USA has been in the form of E85 sales [65] . This is because
E85 has suffered both from limited availability and uncompetitive
pricing on an energy basis.

It was shown by Turner et al. [63,66] that all the possible iso-
stoichiometric ternary blends starting from a binary blend of gaso-
line  and  ethanol  are  practically  invisible  for  the  engine  control
unit (ECU) of flex-fuel vehicles calibrated to run on any ethanol-
gasoline blend up to E85. This opens the possibility to use these
ternary blends as drop-in fuels for flex-fuel vehicles without the
danger of upsetting the on-board diagnostics of the engine man-
agement  system.  If  the  methanol  used  is  of  a  renewable  and
energy-secure  nature  then,  for  a  fixed  volume  of  ethanol  in  the
fuel pool dependent on the biomass limit, an increased level of re-
newability and energy security is achieved. This overall situation
is made possible by the fact that there are more E85/flex-fuel ve-
hicles in existence than can currently be serviced by the E85 fuel
supply chain. The formulation of ternary GEM blends and the prop-
erties of these blends will be discussed in Section 2.9 .

Turner  et  al.  [63,66]  tested  the  drop-in  ability  of  the  iso-
stoichiometric  gasoline-ethanol-methanol  (GEM)  blends  in  two
flex-fuel vehicles. One vehicle was provided with a physical sen-
sor for alcohol content and the other vehicle had a ‘virtual’ sen-
sor. A physical sensor directly measures the alcohol concentration
of the fuel relying on the electric permittivity or the resistance of
the fuel, while a virtual sensor utilizes an algorithm based on the
information of the other sensors of the engine to calculate the al-
cohol concentration. A ‘virtual’ sensor has the advantage that there
is no additional cost in hardware. During vehicle testing, the hy-
pothesis that iso-stoichiometric GEM blends can function as drop-
in  alternatives  to  binary  ethanol-gasoline  blends  was  confirmed.
There were only two malfunction lights when running on the bi-
nary gasoline-methanol blend with the vehicle with the ‘virtual’
sensor. Turner et al. [49,62] stated that this could be due to phase
separation as the vehicle was not subjected to road shocks or ac-
celerations  on  the  test  bench  and  that  some  form  of  cosolvent
might be necessary when methanol and gasoline are blended to-
gether, which was not present in their splash blends 6 . Compared
to the gasoline tests on the same vehicles, there was an overall
efficiency improvement of approximately 5% when using the alco-
hol blends. Turner et al. [63,66] also performed cold start tests. The
only fuel blend which failed the cold start test was the normal E85

blend. This is to be expected since ethanol is harder to start than
gasoline or methanol (see Section 3.3 ), and so reducing the pro-
portion of this component and replacing it with larger amounts of
the other two would only be expected to improve the situation.

Consequently there is the possibility with GEM blends to effec-
tively extend gasoline displacement during winter months when
currently, with existing commercial E85 fuels, the ethanol content
is decreased to levels close to 70% in order to maintain cold starta-
bility. A year-round fixed blend ratio is therefore a possibility. It
is important to note that these tests were conducted on a vehicle
and the emissions were measured at the end of the tailpipe with-
out knowing what the ECU was actually doing. This is addressed
in Section 4.2 where the results of testing of different GEM blends
on engine test benches are discussed.

Next to the hypothesis, another benefit of the GEM-blends is
the potential economic advantage. Turner et al. [63] showed that
with wholesale prices (i.e. without taxes) of $3.11, $2.30 and $1.11
per US gallon for gasoline, ethanol and methanol respectively (as
was the case at the time that paper was written, i.e. around 2011),
the price of the blends can be made significantly lower than gaso-
line  on  an  energy  basis.  With  these  prices,  with  ternary  blends
containing more than 25% by volume of methanol, a reduction in
motoring costs could be realized just through a reduction in the
relative price of the fuel versus gasoline. Since the vehicles would
be expected to become more efficient when operated on the high-
blend alcohol fuels, one would expect another reduction in operat-
ing costs for the user.

Another advantage is that for flex-fuel vehicles, there is no need
for range anxiety, which is a major obstacle for electric vehicles,
because these flex-fuel vehicles are still able to run on gasoline.
The user would be able to run on a high-alcohol GEM blend, on
which the vehicle would be significantly cheaper to operate but
with  a  lower  range  due  to  the  lower  volumetric  energy  content
of the alcohol fuel, or on gasoline, when he or she would like to
travel longer distances before refueling.

2. Fundamentals

Understanding  an  engine’s  behaviour  when  fueled  with
methanol, in terms of power output, efficiency and emissions, their
trade-offs, and their response to engine settings, requires an under-
standing of how methanol’s physical and chemical properties affect
the engine operation. In the following sections, we discuss the im-
pact of basic properties on the engine, with separate sections de-
voted to the more complex properties that change with e.g. pres-
sure and temperature, such as burning velocities and ignition delay
times.

2.1. Physical and chemical properties of methanol relevant to engines

In this section, we will discuss the properties of methanol, com-
pare them to other fuels, and link them to expected consequences
for  engine  design,  engine  parameter  settings  or  engine  perfor-
mance. Here, this will be done in a qualitative way. Later Sections
will quantify them. The properties are listed in Tables 1 (physical

properties), 2 (chemical properties), 3 (fuel-air mixture properties)
and 4 (other).  They are also included for gasoline, iso-octane as
a primary reference fuel for gasoline, the alcohols ethanol and 1-
butanol  (a  higher  alcohol),  methane  as  the  prime  constituent  of
natural gas, and hydrogen.

First, looking at the elemental composition ( Table 2 ), it is clear
that the hydrogen to carbon ratio of methanol is higher than that
of gasoline, and equal to that of methane. Thus, when calculating
2 ) emissions on an energy specific basis (g
the carbon dioxide (CO
CO
2 emissions com-
pared to gasoline. Of course, this assumes a similar conversion ef-
ficiency (brake thermal efficiency, BTE) whereas methanol enables
notably increased efficiencies as will be discussed later on (thus
further lowering the specific CO

2 / MJ), methanol leads to 7% lower specific CO

2 emissions in operation).

Using methane or hydrogen as a fuel further lowers the spe-
2 emissions. However, in both cases it is important to look
cific CO
2  emis-
at the overall picture, i.e. include well to tank (WTT) CO
sions and emissions of other greenhouse gases. This was discussed
in Section 1.4 .

The oxygen content, amounting to half of methanol’s molecular
mass, has important consequences for methanol’s properties as an
engine fuel. The high oxygen content leads to a low (mass-based)
stoichiometric air requirement (air/fuel ratio, AFR), the lowest of
all the fuels listed in the table. This also means that the fraction
of methanol in a stoichiometric mixture is high, see Table 3 (the
highest  on  a  mass  basis,  and  second  to  hydrogen  on  a  volume
basis). Thus, it is important to know the definition for volumet-
ric efficiency that is used, when looking up published values, as
there  will  be  substantial  differences  depending  on  whether  the
fuel  vapour  fraction  has  been  included  or  not.  Despite  the  high
methanol fraction, fuel-air mixture properties such as the viscos-
ity, thermal diffusivity and speed of sound, are close to those of
gasoline-air.

Methanol’s density is higher than that of gasoline, despite its
low  molecular  mass.  This  is  due  to  the  methanol  molecule  be-
ing  polar  due  to  its  OH  group,  causing  hydrogen  bonding.  At
32  kg/kmol,  it  has  the  same  molecular  mass  as  oxygen,  and  so
from  a  physicochemical  standpoint  one  would  expect  it  to  be  a
gas.  The  hydrogen  bonding  however  gives  rise  to  the  formation
of  quasi-super  molecules,  or  cyclic  tetramers,  that  ensures  that
they  are  liquid  at  STP  [67] .  The  hydrogen  bonds  explain  several
characteristics  of  methanol:  high  latent  heat,  infinite  miscibility
with water, low vapour pressures, etc. A significant disadvantage
of the OH group is that it makes methanol phase separate in hy-
drocarbons, depending on the temperature and water concentra-
tion, since it makes it non ideal mixtures. The low vapour pressure
is replaced by the tendency to cause very high vapour pressures
when methanol is mixed with hydrocarbons. This is due to the in-
tramolecular forces between the pure hydrocarbon molecules and
methanol, breaking the hydrogen bonds of the cyclic tetramers and
the small ‘real’ molecules rising through the mixture and leaving
the surface of the mixture easily. This will be further discussed in
Section 2.8.2 .

The high oxygen content obviously reduces the energy content
(heating  value).  The  volumetric  energy  content  is  important  for

55

fuel  injection  system  design  and  fuel  storage.  Methanol’s  higher
density is more than offset by a heating value less than half that
of gasoline, thus the volumetric energy content is half that of gaso-
line and consequently injection durations need to be twice as long
in order to introduce the same energy into the engine, thus neces-
sitating suitable injectors (see Section 3 ). This also implies larger
vehicle fuel tanks are needed for a similar driving range, or that
with the same size of vehicle tank as a gasoline vehicle, driving
range decreases and the driver will need to refuel more often. Note
that increases in efficiency can alleviate this somewhat.

Looking at the volumetric energy content of the fuel/air mix-
ture  (energy per unit mole of stoichiometric mixture),  it can be
seen that this is 5% lower for methanol relative to gasoline. Thus,
an engine with external mixture formation (e.g. port fuel injection)
would have a lower maximum specific torque (hence, peak brake
mean effective pressure, BMEP) on methanol. However, there are
other factors also influencing the specific torque, such as charge
cooling and engine efficiency,  changing this picture as discussed
below. The energy per unit of air on the other hand is 6% higher
for methanol relative to gasoline, so an engine with internal mix-
ture formation (direct injection) can be expected to have a higher
BMEP on methanol.

Methanol’s  polarity  also  causes  a  low  vapour  pressure.  This
lower volatility, in combination with a higher lower flammability
limit in air (so a higher concentration to reach before a flammable
mixture is obtained), leads to a more difficult cold start. Measures
to overcome this are discussed in Section 3 .

The hydrogen bonding resulting from methanol’s polar nature
also  leads  to  a  high  heat  of  vaporization.  When  also  taking  the
lower  stoichiometric  air  requirement  into  account,  this  means  a
sevenfold increase of the energy needed to evaporate the fuel, rel-
ative to gasoline. When methanol is introduced in the engine’s in-
take port, this can lead to very low temperatures, which needs to
be addressed in the engine design ( Section 3 ). The lower tempera-
ture resulting from methanol’s evaporation (either in the port or in
the combustion chamber), leads to lower temperatures throughout
the engine cycle. Additionally, the adiabatic flame temperature of
methanol-air combustion is the lowest of all fuels in Table 2 . This
points to multiple potential benefits. Lower wall heat losses can
be expected (benefiting engine efficiency), as well as lower emis-
X . For spark ignition (SI) operation, the danger of au-
sions of NO
toignition is lower, thus enabling the use of higher compression ra-
tios (again benefiting engine efficiency) and/or using optimal spark
timing  throughout  the  engine  operating  map.  The  cooling  effect
also  leads  to  increased  intake  air  densities,  increasing  volumet-
ric efficiency. As will be shown later, this more than offsets the
lower  volumetric  energy  content  of  a  methanol-air  mixture,  im-
proving the engine’s power density. An additional downside of the
low temperatures is that obtaining a fast catalyst light-off can be a
challenge.

Next  to  improved  resistance  to  autoignition  (engine  knock)
because  of  lower  in-cylinder  temperatures,  the  higher  autoigni-
tion  temperature  of  methanol  also  indicates  a  higher  chemical
resistance  to  knocking.  Furthermore,  as  will  be  detailed  below,
methanol-air mixtures have a higher laminar burning velocity than
gasoline. Thus, end-gas autoignition is less likely to occur as the
flame propagation is faster, consuming the end-gas before it can
get to autoignition conditions. A higher laminar burning velocity
typically also corresponds with an increased tolerance for dilution,
i.e. allowing leaner operation or higher amounts of exhaust gas re-
circulation.

The effect of charge cooling causes difficulties when attempting
to determine the octane number of alcohols according to common
methods.  Yates  et  al.  [68]  reviewed  several  published  values  for
RON and MON of alcohols and concluded that most of these are
affected by the evaporative cooling effect. Based on this observa-

tion, they selected octane values from work which controlled the
intake charge temperature, irrespective of the evaporation effect.
These values are given in Table 4 and reflect the knock resistance
of alcohols due to factors such as chemical autoignition behaviour
and flame speed. Clearly, methanol is very well suited for spark ig-
nition combustion. The autoignition temperatures of methane and
hydrogen might be even higher, but being typically introduced into
the  engine  in  gaseous  state,  they  do  not  take  any  advantage  of
charge cooling. This is especially true in engines with direct injec-
tion, as the evaporation energy is mainly extracted from the mix-
ture and not from the engine structure. Based on several studies
investigating the octane number benefit due to evaporation cool-
ing, Anderson et al. concluded that a temperature reduction of 7 K
corresponds to an ON benefit of approximately 1 [65] . This is in
good agreement with the experimental study of Milpied et al. on
a  downsized,  turbocharged  flex-fuel  engine  with  direct  injection
[69] . They reported a benefit of 1 ON for an increase in cooling
power of 2-8 kJ/kg mixture. Based on a computational model, de-
scribing the kinetics of alcohol autoignition, Bromberg et al. found
even higher values for the effective octane number for alcohols in
direct  injection  engines  (150  for  ethanol  and  180  for  methanol)
[70] .  Stein  et  al.  [16]  assessed  the  knock  resistance  of  different
ethanol-gasoline blends in a single cylinder engine with three in-
jection  systems:  upstream,  prevaporized  fuel  injection;  port-fuel
injection and direct injection. They found that the chemical and
evaporative charge cooling anti-knock effect are of comparable im-
portance with direct injection. For port-fuel injected engines, the
cooling effect is considerably smaller.

Methanol’s high octane numbers, with a RON of 109 and a MON

of 92, gives it a sensitivity of 17, this property being defined as:

S = RON − MON

(2)

where S is sensitivity and RON and MON are the octane numbers
defined in the relevant tests. Both a high RON and a high sensi-
tivity have been shown to be directionally important with regards
to the present evolution of SI engines towards ‘beyond RON’ opera-
tion [71–75] . The high sensitivity is due to a combination of effects,
but  mainly  that  of  the  heat  of  vaporization.  The  RON  and  MON
tests are performed with different fuel preparation approaches. For
the RON test, only the air is heated, the fuel being introduced af-
ter this process. This means that the high latent heat of methanol
causes the temperature in-cylinder to drop considerably, and the
knock limit to extend commensurately. For the MON test, however,
the  entire mixture  is  heated  after  the  fuel  has  been  introduced,
nullifying this effect. Luef and co-workers [76] investigated this ef-
fect further by using direct injection in a modified CFR engine, and
attempted to quantify it for different fuels.

Methanol’s very low cetane number means that special mea-
sures are needed to enable the use of methanol in compression
ignition (CI) engines (see Section 5 ).

Looking at the properties of the burned mixture ( Table 3 ), first
of all it is noteworthy that with methanol combustion there is a
molar expansion instead of a contraction as is the case for e.g. hy-
drogen  combustion.  This  can  be  expected  to  increase  the  effi-
ciency  [77] .  Also,  the  ratio  of  triatomic  molecules  (i.e.,  CO
2  and
2 )  in  the  burned  gas  is
H
higher  for  methanol  compared  to  gasoline  (due  to  the  low  AFR
and thus lower amount of nitrogen in the combustion chamber),
which  leads  to  a  higher  heat  capacity  of  the  products,  lowering
peak temperatures and decreasing heat losses. Exhaust tempera-
tures can also be expected to be lower than with gasoline. On the
other hand, due to the lower amount of nitrogen in the mixture,
the mass fraction of water vapour in the burned gas is higher than
for gasoline or methane, leading to a higher thermal conductivity
(this also affects fuel reforming using exhaust gas, see Section 6 ).
Section 7.1.5 will discuss the net effect on in-cylinder heat transfer.

Reviewing methanol’s flammability limits, first of all it is clear
that  the  lower  flammability  limit  (LFL)  is  much  higher  than  for
gasoline.  Once  the  LFL  has  been  reached,  the  methanol-air  mix-
ture remains flammable over a relatively wide range. The higher
air-to-fuel  equivalence  ratio  λ corresponding  with  the  LFL,  indi-
cates a potentially slightly wider range for qualitative load control
(controlling power output through mixture richness i.e. the range
in output power offered between stoichiometric operation and the
leanest mixtures for which stable operation is still possible).

The  minimum  ignition  energy  and  quenching  distance  of
methanol are the second lowest values in Table 3 , with only hy-
drogen having even lower values. The lower minimum ignition en-
ergy relative to gasoline could mean more issues with surface ig-
nition  (preignition)  in  the  engine,  especially  combined  with  the
higher  laminar  burning  velocity  [78] .  Note,  however,  that  very
few references can be found reporting data for the minimum ig-
nition  energy  and  quenching  distance,  and  all  are  relatively  old,
so  these  data  should  be  treated  with  care.  Recently,  Fernández-
Tarrazo  et  al.  [79]  elaborated  a  computational  approach  for  de-
termining  the  minimum  ignition  energy.  They  found  the  mini-
mum ignition energy to be reached for an equivalence ratio φ =
1 . 25 . Based on their calculations using a reduced chemical kinetic
scheme, they proposed a simple equation for calculating the mini-
mum ignition energy (MIE) of methanol-air mixtures as a function
of  temperature  (T):  MIE  = 0 . 24 × 2 . 59 −T / 300 K ,  with  MIE  given  in
mJ.

Finally, the flash points of the alcohol fuels are higher than for
the  other  fuels,  which  was  mentioned  in  Section  1.5  when  dis-
cussing safety of fuel storage.

Summarizing the properties reviewed above, methanol has the
potential to increase engine performance and efficiency over that
achievable with gasoline thanks to a variety of interesting proper-
ties. The high heat of vaporization, combined with low stoichio-
metric air/fuel ratio, leads to high degrees of intake charge cool-
ing as the fuel evaporates. This is especially true for engines with
direct  injection.  The  charge  cooling  not  only  leads  to  increased
charge density, and thus higher volumetric efficiency, but also con-
siderably reduces the propensity of the engine to knock [18,80] .

2.2. Reaction kinetics and emission formation mechanisms

As  mentioned  above,  the  minimum  ignition  energy  of
methanol-air  mixtures  has  recently  been  calculated  using  a  re-
duced kinetic scheme. Kinetic schemes describing the detailed oxi-
dation chemistry are important tools for understanding the magni-
tudes and dependencies of key engine combustion parameters such
as the minimum ignition energy, autoignition delay times, laminar
burning velocities etc.

The reaction kinetics of the methanol-air system are reasonably
well understood, methanol being a simple molecule. Its oxidation
is also the basis for the oxidation of longer chain alcohols, which
has been an additional motivation for studying its reaction kinetics.
Sarathy et al. [78] reviewed alcohol combustion chemistry, includ-
ing  methanol,  listing  the  most  important  comprehensive  kinetic
mechanisms and detailing the primary reaction channels. They also
point to remaining uncertainties in certain rate constants, for ex-
ample for the reaction CH 3 OH + HO 2 ↔ CH 2 OH + H 2 O 2 , which is
important for the ignition delay time. Furthermore, they stress the
need for laminar burning velocity data at high pressure (see next
Section). Burke et al. concur in their recent paper [81] , proposing
a comprehensive reaction mechanism for methanol oxidation vali-
dated against the available experimental data obtained from shock
tubes, rapid compression machines, jet-stirred reactors etc., con-
cluding that additional data at high pressure and low temperature
are needed.

Fig. 4.  The formation of emissions of soot (in ppm by mass, in ‘island’ at top of
plots, i.e. at the high equivalence ratios) and NO X (in ppm by volume, bottom right
of plots, i.e. at high temperatures and lower equivalence ratios) as a function of
equivalence ratio and temperature, for methanol and diesel. Adiabatic flame tem-
peratures also shown.

Next, we discuss a result from (among other things) reaction ki-
netics: emission formation mechanisms for methanol combustion.
Emission  levels  obtained  from  actual  measurements  will  be  dis-
cussed in later Sections.

Svensson et al. [82] ran stochastic reactor simulations using de-
tailed chemistry, including a soot model, to compare emission for-
mation pathways between methanol and diesel (represented by a
mixture of n-heptane and toluene). They constructed maps for the
different emission species, as a function of equivalence ratio φ and
temperature T , and then investigated the trajectories in φ, T co-
ordinates that could be expected during engine operation. Fig. 4

puted for an initial temperature of 10 0 0 K and an initial pressure
of 75 bar, which would be the end-of-compression conditions for
the engine experiments that were used for validation of some of
the results. The plots clearly illustrate that methanol combustion
will not result in soot formation: first, the soot region (delineated
by 0.01 ppm of soot formed) is much smaller than for diesel com-
bustion,  it  is  limited  to φ > 2.6  and  T > 1950  K.  Second,  because
of methanol’s long autoignition delay (see Section 2.5 ) and high
heat of vaporization, mixing times are long and ignition only oc-
curs when the methanol fuel has already mixed with air to equiv-
alence ratios lean of stoichiometric.

The plot also shows the region in which NO

X is formed to be
quite similar between methanol and diesel. The production of NO
X
depends on the temperature, oxygen content and residence time of
the combustion gases in the cylinder [83] . Thus, the way in which
the engine is operated (i.e. the temperatures occurring during the
cycle) can dominate over the fuel effect in determining the actual
X emissions. When compared to gasoline, methanol reduces the
NO
in-cylinder temperatures because of its lower adiabatic flame tem-
perature, high burned gas heat capacity and evaporation cooling.
Consequently, NO
X  can be expected to be lower if the engine is
operated at the same equivalence ratio [20] .

Carbon monoxide (CO) is mainly formed by incomplete com-
bustion and thus is very dependent on the mixture equivalence ra-
tio. Additionally CO can be formed by dissociation of CO
2 , albeit
this route occurs mainly at higher temperatures [83] . Different au-
thors have suggested that the oxygenated nature of alcohols can
lead to more complete combustion and consequently to reduced
engine-out  CO  emissions  (the  so-called  premixed  oxygen  effect)
[20,84,85] . However, slight deviations from stoichiometry, for ex-
ample during cold start, will have a more defining impact on CO
levels.

For unburned hydrocarbons (UHC) the situation is similar. These
emissions are mainly caused by failed or incomplete combustion,
unburned  fuel  in  combustion  chamber  crevices  or  wall  wetting
during  engine  warm-up  [83] .  Methanol  can  enable  slight  reduc-
tions in engine-out UHC levels thanks to the premixed oxygen ef-
fect [85] . Unlike gasoline, methanol does not have components that
only boil at high temperatures and thus can cause UHC emissions
[86] . These benefits can be cancelled out by increased wall wetting
due  to  the  elevated  heat  of  vaporization  of  methanol,  especially
during cold start.

A  compound  of  concern  is  formaldehyde,  HCHO.  This  plays
an important role in photochemistry and is a human carcinogen
[87] .  Formaldehyde  emissions  have  been  reported  to  potentially
be higher on methanol (-blends) than on gasoline [22] , so could
be a concern for methanol-fuelled vehicles as these emissions are
not always regulated currently (they are limited in U.S. regulations
for vehicle exhaust emissions). Engine-out emissions of HCHO are
a balance between the formation of formaldehyde and its subse-
quent oxidation, since formaldehyde is an intermediate species in
the reaction pathway of methanol oxidation [78] . Thus, formalde-
hyde emissions will peak when the mixture experiences interme-
diate  temperatures  [82]  (around  10 0 0  K)  and  then  is  prevented
from  getting  to  higher  temperatures  that  would  lead  to  full  ox-
idation  of  the  formaldehyde.  Such  can  be  the  case  for  PFI  en-
gines, where methanol gets into crevices during compression and
then escapes these crevices during expansion, when pressures are
dropping. With properly controlled DI engines, it should be pos-
sible  to  prevent  at  least  some  of  the  emission  of  formaldehyde.
Section 4 will continue this discussion by looking at how effective
aftertreatment is for formaldehyde emissions. Note that formalde-
hyde is also an intermediate species in the combustion of hydro-
carbons such as gasoline and diesel and thus can also be found in
the exhaust emissions of engines running on these fuels.

It is important to note that, in the past, some authors have con-
cluded that light alcohols can contribute to significant reductions
in  hydrocarbons  (HC)  based  on  Flame  Ionization  Detector  (FID)
measurements.  Note  that  carbonyl  compounds  do  not  belong  to
the definition of hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons consist of only hy-
drogen and carbon, while carbonyl compounds consist also of oxy-
gen. In the U.S. regulation, non-methane organic gases (NMOG) are
defined, and this definition includes also carbonyl compounds. To-
day, we know that FID measurements have a low relative sensi-
tivity to oxygenated compounds and thus other methods, such as
FTIR (Fourier transform infrared) should be used to measure HC
levels in alcohol engines [88–90] . Wei et al. point out that an FID
has  a  very  low  response  to  formaldehyde,  and  use  a  fast  chro-
matographic method with a pulsed discharge helium ionization de-
tector instead [87] . Geng et al. compare the FTIR method to gas
chromatography (GC) and high performance liquid chromatography
[91] . The latter two prove to be more accurate, but are offline mea-
surements. As the FTIR results were consistently higher, and are
obtained online, the FTIR method can be seen as a more practical
measurement.

2.3. Laminar burning velocities

Instead  of  including  a  single  value  for  the  laminar  burn-
ing  velocity  (LBV),  at  some  reference  condition,  in  Table  3 ,  this
parameter  is  discussed  here  separately.  Note  that  the  LBV  of
methanol-gasoline blends will be discussed in a separate section
( Section  2.8.7 ).  First  of  all,  it  is  worth  remembering  the  impor-
tance of this parameter for engine combustion. The initial stage of
combustion  in  spark-ignition  engines,  is  the  quasi-laminar  flame
growth of the original ignition kernel [92] . Thus, the duration of
this phase (in practice denoted by the crank angle duration it takes
to  burn  the  first  2,  5  or  10%  of  the  cylinder  charge),  is  to  the
first order inversely proportional to the laminar burning velocity.
It has been shown that this phase has a defining influence on the
combustion stability, affecting cyclic variation. This is illustrated by
how the dilution tolerance increases with laminar burning veloc-
ity [93] . The main combustion phase, governed by turbulent flame
propagation, is also affected by the laminar burning velocity, albeit
to a lesser degree [94] .

Vancoillie et al. [95] reviewed the available experimental data
on  the  LBV  of  methanol-air  mixtures.  They  concluded  that  data
at engine-like conditions are very scarce, in particular for elevated
pressure and diluted mixtures. Part of the data was also noted to
be compromised as it was derived using techniques later proven to
be inaccurate (e.g. data obtained from spherically expanding flames
not accounting for the effects of flame stretch). The limited avail-
able data deemed to be reliable were subsequently used as valida-
tion data for LBV calculations using chemical kinetic schemes for
the methanol-air system. The authors selected the mechanism of Li
et al. [96] as the most promising one, being widely validated and
not too demanding in terms of computational time (including 39
species and 238 elementary reactions). Here, we use computed re-
sults using the Li et al. mechanism to compare the LBV dependence
on equivalence ratio, pressure, temperature and dilution level, of
methanol to that of some other fuels.

First of all though, it must be stressed that reliable LBV data
is relatively scarce in general, and even more so for different fu-
els at similar conditions. Thus, it is mostly necessary to extrapo-
late values using reported temperature or pressure dependencies.
These  dependencies  in  turn  have  typically  been  derived  from  a
limited set of measurements where temperature or pressure has
been changed, so the uncertainty on the dependencies is higher
than on the LBV data itself.

In  the  following,  we  compare  LBV  calculations  for  methanol,
against data for iso-octane, methane and hydrogen. Fig. 5 shows

the LBV for varying equivalence ratio, at a pressure of 1 bar and a
temperature of 360 K. The data for iso-octane has been taken di-
rectly from Sileghem et al. [97] . For hydrogen, the values were cal-
culated using the correlation proposed by Verhelst et al. [98] , de-
rived from chemical kinetic calculations using a scheme validated
for engine-like conditions. The methane data were taken from Gu
et al. [99] , requiring calculation at 360 K based on measured values
at 300 K and a temperature exponent derived from measurements
up to 400 K.

It  can  clearly  be  seen  that  hydrogen  burns  much  faster  than
any of the other fuels. After hydrogen, methanol can be seen to
have the highest value, its burning velocity at stoichiometry being
a third higher than that of iso-octane. As mentioned earlier, the in-
creased burning velocity contributes to a higher knock resistance,
next to allowing shorter combustion duration which also increases
efficiency. The equivalence ratio at which the peak LBV is reached,
is shifted to the rich side for methanol compared to iso-octane and
methane (note that for hydrogen this is even richer).

Next, we take a look at how the LBV changes with temperature.
Sileghem et al. [97,100] measured the LBV of methanol, iso-octane
and gasoline for different tem peratures and equivalence ratios (at
atmospheric pressure). They confirmed that the influence of initial
temperature  on  the  LBV  can  be  described  well  by  the  following
correlation:

perature exponent. Sileghem et al. calculated the temperature ex-
ponent over a temperature range of 298 K to 358 K. Results are
shown  as  a  function  of  equivalence  ratio  in  Fig.  6 .  The  graph
shows no significant differences between methanol and gasoline,
although  qualitatively  for  methanol  the  temperature  dependence
is more constant around stoichiometry. Unfortunately, the studied
temperature range is quite small which leads to rather high un-
certainties for the temperature exponent, and moreover the tem-
peratures are very low compared to engine conditions. Values for
burning velocities at higher temperatures have been reported, but
these are compromised by e.g. neglecting effects of flame stretch
[95] . Consequently, the behaviour of methanol flames at engine-
like temperatures and possible differences with other fuels can cur-
rently  only  be derived from chemical kinetic  calculations, which
have only been validated for LBVs at lower temperatures, or for
other  metrics  at  higher  temperatures  (e.g.  ignition  delay  times).
Very recently, Katoch et al. [101] reported LBV measurements for
methanol-air  mixtures  at  temperatures  up  to  650  K.  They  point
out that older LBV correlations use either a constant temperature

exponent α, or one which linearly decreases with equivalence ra-
tio φ, and that the measurements of Sileghem et al. [97] were the
first  time  that  a  parabolic  dependence  of α on φ was  reported.
Using a new method involving the stabilization of a near to planar
flame in a heated quartz diverging channel, Katoch et al. confirmed
this parabolic dependence. Their measurements also indicate an in-
creased divergence from predictions using chemical kinetic mech-
anisms at higher temperatures and stoichiometric to rich mixtures.
The situation is worse still when looking for the pressure de-
pendence.  As  reviewed  by  Vancoillie  et  al.  [95]  and  Beeckmann
et al. [102] , reliable data at elevated pressure is scarce. Discard-
ing all data that is potentially compromised by the occurrence of
flame instabilities, or has not correctly accounted for flame stretch,
leaves only the measurements reported by Zhang et al. [103] (up
to  7.5  bar)  and  Beeckmann  et  al.  [102]  (10  bar).  The  data  re-
ported by Beeckmann et al. also includes other alcohols. Interest-
ingly, methanol’s LBV is found to be around 15% faster than the
other alcohols for rich conditions, whereas differences are smaller
for lean to stoichiometric mixtures. Also, the peak LBV is found to
be obtained for richer mixtures in the case of methanol (around
φ = 1 . 2 , as was also seen at 1 bar in Fig. 5 , as opposed to around
φ = 1 . 1 for the other alcohols). Both features are reproduced by
kinetic schemes [78] . The authors also report an increasing devia-
tion between measured laminar burning velocities and predictions
using several kinetic schemes at higher pressure.

As will be discussed in Section 7 , uncertainties on the LBV value
have a large impact on engine cycle simulations. Clearly, there is
still a need for experimental confirmation of the existing data at
higher pressure, and preferably an extension to higher pressures.

Finally, for engine combustion, in general and in particular for
new concepts relying on highly diluted combustion, it is important
to know how the LBV is affected by combustion residuals. Unfortu-
nately, very few data can be found. The only recent data are those
of Vancoillie et al. [104] , who measured the effects of dilution to
validate the dilution term in their LBV correlation [95] .

2.4. Turbulent burning velocities

The turbulent burning velocity u t of a fuel-air mixture obviously
has a large impact on engine combustion. The turbulent burning
velocity is not solely a function of the turbulence (as assumed in
some turbulent combustion models [92] ) but the fuel’s properties
also  affect  the  sensitivity  of  a  fuel-air  flame  to  turbulence  [94] .
Understanding  the  turbulent  burning  velocity  and  its  dependen-
cies helps in explaining observed engine behaviour and is neces-

2.5. Ignition delay

Methanol  has  an  elevated  chemical  resistance  to  autoignition
[68] .  This  is  due  to  the  single-stage  autoignition  behaviour  of
methanol. The autoignition of gasoline is typically a two-stage pro-
cess,  where  at  temperatures  below  900  K,  low-temperature  oxi-
dation of the mixture takes place. These so-called cool-flame re-
actions release heat, which boosts the high-temperature oxidation
responsible for knock. At temperatures between 800 K and 1000 K
the  low-temperature  oxidation  is  inhibited  by  degenerate  chain
branching. This phenomenon occurs when the precursors of chain
branching decompose back to the reactants at high temperatures
due  to  their  instability.  So  between  800  K  and  10 0 0  K  increas-
ing the temperature will reduce the cool flame temperature rise,
leading to less promotion of the main, high temperature autoigni-
tion reaction. This results in autoignition delay times rising with
temperature at these conditions. The autoignition delay time τ is
the time it takes for a quiescent, homogeneous mixture to sponta-
neously ignite. This ignition is generally characterized by a certain
temperature  or  product  concentration  threshold  being  exceeded.
The temperature frame of rising τ with increasing temperature is
called the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) region. This will
be  illustrated  in  Section  2.8  for  gasoline-methanol  mixtures.  For
methanol, degenerate chain branching reactions are of low impor-
tance in the oxidation mechanism [109] . Consequently, methanol
does not have a NTC region. This is a characteristic it shares with
ethanol [68] .

Models  to  predict  the  autoignition  of  unburned  mixture  in
spark-ignition engines range from simple empirical expressions to
complex formulations featuring reduced or full chemical kinetics
[110] . A widely employed empirical approach is to apply the con-
servation of delay principle of Livengood and Wu [111] . According
to this principle the overall ignition delay time can be found by in-
tegrating its instantaneous value during the compression and com-
bustion stroke. This is analytically expressed by the knock integral
reaching unity:
(cid:4)

= 1

(4)

t KO

t IVC

d t
τ (t)

Where  t IVC  and  t KO  are  the  time  at  intake  valve  closure  and
knock onset respectively, and τ ( t ) is the instantaneous autoignition
delay time.

The autoignition delay time τ (in s) at instantaneous cylinder
pressure p [bar], unburned mixture temperature T [K] and com-
position is typically given by an Arrhenius expression representing
the rate limiting step of autoignition:
B
τ = Ap n
T
e

(5)

Where  A,  n  and  B  are  parameters  depending  on  the  mixture
composition (fuel, φ, residual gas ratio). The most widely used pa-
rameter set for Eq. 5 was introduced in 1978 by Douaud and Eyzat
based on recording the knock onset in a CFR engine for a range of
running conditions and PRFs (primary reference fuels) with octane
numbers between 80 and 100 [112] . It has also been extensively
used in simulations for non-PRF fuels, including ethanol [113,114] .
Another well known parameter set is that of Frankzke, based on
knock studies with gasoline in production engines [115] .

For neat methanol a number of correlations were proposed over
the years based on shock tube experiments [116,117] , rapid com-
pression  machine  (RCM)  tests  [118]  and  chemical  kinetics  calcu-
lations  [68,95] .  Table  5  shows  that  the  correlations  proposed  by
Yates et al. [68] and Vancoillie et al. [95] cover the widest range of
engine-like conditions. However, only that of Vancoillie et al. in-
cludes the effect of residual gas dilution on τ .

In Fig. 8 the correlations of Douaud & Eyzat (ON = 109) [112] ,
Frankzke  [115] ,  Yates  et  al.  [68]  and  Vancoillie  et  al.  [95]  are

sary for properly modelling engine combustion. Hence, this section
discusses the turbulent burning velocity for methanol mixtures.

A large body of literature, comprehensively reviewed by Lipat-
nikov and Chomiak [94] , indicates that, depending on the condi-
tions  and  mixture  properties,  flame  stretch  and  instabilities  can
considerably affect u t . The high pressures in engines will lead to
flames being increasingly unstable [105] . This was confirmed for
ethanol-air mixtures by Ohara et al. [106] . Using experiments in a
fan-stirred bomb for rms turbulent velocities u (cid:6)  between 0.8 and
1.6 m/s they observed that as the initial pressure increased, the
flame front became more finely wrinkled, leading to an increase in
u t / u

l for the same u (cid:6) / u
l .
For methanol, the influence of preferential diffusion effects can
be expected to be lower than for very diffusive fuels such as hydro-
gen, because the mass diffusivity of methanol ( M = 32 kg/kmol) is
comparable to that of oxygen ( M = 32 kg/kmol). Also the change in
Lewis number with varying equivalence ratio is less than for some
other fuels (see Fig. 7 ), limiting thermo-diffusive effects. This was
confirmed in closed vessel experiments by Lawes et al. [107] and
Ohara et al. [106] . These studies showed that u t / u
l  remained al-
most constant for a wide range of equivalence ratios. For methane
and iso-octane mixtures, on the other hand, there was a clear ef-
fect of differential diffusion instabilities: in the case of methane,
lean mixtures exhibit a much higher ratio of u t / u
l compared to rich
mixtures whereas for iso-octane the opposite behaviour is found.
Only for very lean ( φ < 0.7) and very rich mixtures ( φ > 1.8) there
was a noticeable rise in u t / u
l for methanol, probably caused by the
rise in u (cid:6) / u
l .

l  the  effects  of  counter-gradient  transport  and
flame-generated turbulence can become important. In this respect,
methanol combustion in SI engines is comparable to hydrocarbon
combustion:  u (cid:6) / u
l  can  be  expected  to  be  high  enough  to  ignore
these effects [108] . This is important, since a lot of turbulent com-
bustion models rely on this assumption (see Section 7 ).

At  low  u (cid:6) / u

Vancoillie et al. [104] measured turbulent burning velocities of
methanol-air mixtures in a fan-stirred constant volume bomb. The
obtained data was then used to assess the performance of a num-
ber of widely used turbulent burning velocity models. The authors
concluded that the effect of rms turbulent velocity on u t  is pre-
dicted well by most models, whereas the effect of equivalence ratio
was best reproduced by the models that incorporate thermodiffu-
sive mixture properties. The effect of pressure was less well pre-
dicted.

compared for an adiabatic compression from 10 bar/575 K to 80
bar/1042 K. Note that the correlation of Douaud & Eyzat has been
used outside its range of validity (ON between 80 and 100). The
most recent correlation, of Vancoillie et al., is seen to yield very
similar results to that of Yates et al. However, compared to that
correlation,  it  comprises  the  effect  of  mixture  composition  ( φ,
residuals) on the autoignition delay time, so the correlation of Van-
coillie et al. [95] can be recommended. The temperature-pressure
dependence  is  much  steeper  than  that  predicted  by  Douaud  &
Eyzat.  Although  the  correlation  of  Frankzke  was  developed  for
gasoline, its temperature-pressure dependence is remarkably com-
parable to that of the correlation of Vancoillie et al. In Section 7 we
will discuss the performance of these correlations when used in
knock prediction models.

2.6. Sprays

Here, we briefly touch on methanol fuel sprays. Fuels are typ-
ically  introduced  in  engines  through  sprays,  either  in  the  intake
port (port fuel injection, PFI), or directly in the combustion cham-
ber  (direct  injection,  DI).  The  morphology  of  the  fuel  spray  and
its characteristics (spray penetration, spray angle, droplet size dis-
tribution  etc.)  are  dependent  on  many  parameters.  Here,  we  fo-
cus  on  the  effect  of  fuel  properties  on  the  spray  behaviour.  As
methanol engines are currently mostly derivatives from e.g. gaso-
line engines, it is important to know how the spray will be affected
when switching fuels. For instance, if the spray changes in such a
way that wall wetting would change, this will have an important
effect on efficiency (through combustion efficiency and potentially
wall heat loss) and emissions. Section 3 will discuss how fuel in-
jection equipment itself has to be adapted for methanol use.

We  first  look  at  ‘normal’  injection,  i.e.  where  the  fuel  is  in-
jected into an environment that is at a pressure above the fuel’s
saturation pressure. In this case, the primary breakup depends on
a competition between spray jet inertia, surface tension, viscous

forces, and drag [119] . Thus, the fuel properties of primary impor-
tance here are density, viscosity and surface tension. The spray be-
haviour is understood to depend on the Reynolds number, as the
ratio between inertial and viscous forces; the Weber number, as
the ratio between inertial and surface tension forces; and on the
ratio between ambient density and fuel density (since this affects
the ratio of drag to inertial forces).

Fuel density is higher for methanol compared to gasoline, vis-
cosity  is  slightly  higher,  and  surface  tension  is  comparable  (see
Table 1 ). Zeng et al. [119] showed how the resulting Reynolds and
Weber numbers are quite comparable between methanol and gaso-
line. They also looked at ethanol, which showed different numbers
due to its significantly higher viscosity. This would indicate a more
difficult primary breakup for ethanol. However, even for ethanol,
the spray properties have been reported to be very close to those
of gasoline [120,121] . Zeng et al. reported spray penetration differ-
ences between gasoline and methanol to be small.

In the case of flash boiling, i.e. when injecting fuel into an am-
bient pressure that is below the fuel’s saturation pressure, such as
could occur during idle or part load operation with injection dur-
ing the  intake stroke  or when the  fuel temperature is high, en-
hanced vaporisation will occur. This is due to bubbles being cre-
ated inside the liquid due to its vaporising, and disintegrating the
jet. Zeng et al. [122] also studied flash boiling, reporting ‘collaps-
ing’ sprays that, for fuel temperatures between 50 and 90 °C, looked
very similar between n-hexane and methanol.

The picture above is far from complete, as for instance in-nozzle
cavitation will also be influenced by vapour pressure, viscosity and
density, and can have a large influence on primary breakup [123] .
However, the literature on methanol sprays is very limited. Based
on the few data discussed above no major differences in spray be-
haviour seem to be expected.

2.7. Properties of methanol-water blends

The infinite miscibility of the light alcohols in water has led to
some investigation of water-alcohol solutions in combustion sys-
tems, water being known to be a knock suppressant. Also, as dis-
cussed in Section 1.3 , the direct use of ‘raw’ methanol could lead
to lower fuel cost. Most and Longwell tested pure methanol and
mixtures with 5 and 10% water by volume in a CFR single-cylinder
engine and found that water increased the octane number of the
mixture [124] . Their data in this respect is reproduced in Table 6 7 .

7

Note that the MON value is lower that the value in Table 4 , which is proba-
bly due to Most and Longwell’s measurement predating the modifications to the

aircraft piston engines, the freezing point is -44 °C, which would
have been an important consideration in that application for any
residual mixture in the system at altitude. Finally, the azeotrope
for  both  types  of  mixture  is  interesting,  and  is  maximized  for
methanol: at 82% methanol by mass the freezing point of the mix-
ture is –124 °C, lower than either the freezing point of water (0 °C)
or methanol (–97.6 °C).

Water  has  a  higher  latent  heat  of  vaporization  and  a  higher
specific heat capacity than methanol, ethanol or gasoline (heat of
vaporization of water is 2257 kJ/kg vs. 1100 kJ/kg for methanol).
Because the stoichiometric air quantity also decreases with water
addition in the fuel blend, the latent heat of vaporization per kg
air increases significantly and this leads to an even larger cooling
effect of the intake charge. How this translates to the achievable
engine power output can thus be expected to depend on the com-
petition between the higher volumetric efficiency obtained through
the charge cooling, and the lower energy content of the fuel. The
higher specific heat capacity of the water vapour results also in a
more isothermal compression and thus the compression work de-
creases which should have a positive effect on the efficiency.

One limit to the amount of water that can be allowed in the
methanol fuel is the combustion stability, since burning velocities
are reduced due to the presence of the inert water. Recently, Liang
and Stone measured the effect of adding up to 40 vol% of water, on
the laminar burning velocity [126] , reporting the mixture diluted
with  40  vol%  of  water  to  burn  55%  slower.  The  addition  of  wa-
ter also influenced (delayed) the onset of flame instability, indicat-
ing that turbulent burning velocities might be even more affected.
Section 4.3 reports the results of engine tests on water-methanol
blends.

2.8. Properties of methanol-gasoline blends

Solutions  of  methanol  and/or  ethanol  in  gasoline  behave  as
non-ideal mixtures:  the alcohol-alcohol interactions are different
from the alcohol-gasoline or gasoline-gasoline interactions due to
the polarity of the alcohol molecules and the resulting hydrogen
bonding  between  alcohol  molecules.  As  the  blend  ratio  changes,
certain  interactions  can  become  stronger  or  weaker  resulting  in
a non-linear behaviour with the molar content of the individual
component. For example when the alcohol is mixed with increas-
ing quantities of gasoline, which is a non-polar liquid, the hydro-
gen bonds are progressively weakened and become less extensive.
In the case of methanol, the methanol molecule starts to behave as
a low molecular mass component in gasoline, which is a mixture
of hundreds of hydrocarbons, instead of a cyclic tetramer with four
times the mass of an individual methanol molecule.

In this Section, properties with a non-linear behaviour will be

discussed.

2.8.1. Volume versus mole concentration

As mentioned above, the concentration of fuel blends is usu-
ally quantified in terms of volume fraction, whereas the mole frac-
tion of a component should provide the more meaningful insight
into the variation of physico-chemical properties since fuels com-
bust in the gaseous phase. Blends of different fuels for which there
is a large difference in the ratio of density of the component to
the molar mass of the component will exhibit a large difference
in concentration expressed in terms of mole fraction and volume
fraction.  This  is  especially  true  for  lower  carbon  count  alcohols
blended in gasoline. This is shown in Fig. 11 in which the rela-
tionship between mole and volume fraction for alcohols blended
in  standard  gasoline  (molar  mass  =  107 kg / kmol  and  density  =
740 kg / m 3 ) is plotted. For ethanol and methanol there is a signif-
icant difference, e.g. M10 and E10 on a volumetric basis become
respectively M28 and E22 on a molar basis. For higher alcohols,

function of volume fraction. Reproduced from [32] .

Fig. 10.  Freezing points of alcohol-water mixtures by mass and by volume. Data
replotted and calculated from [29,278] .

The elevated knock resistance is due to the larger cooling effect
and the water vapour dilution which both contribute to lower in-
cylinder temperatures.

One  thing  apparent  in  the  data  of  Most  and  Longwell  is  the
non-linearity of the effect of adding water to methanol. This would
be worthy of more study, and is likely to be important in any use
of  water/methanol  as  ADI  mixtures  in  octane-on-demand  (OOD)
systems. This is discussed in Section 4.4 . Note that adding a certain
volume percentage of water to methanol does not scale linearly to
a mole percentage. In Fig. 9 , the relationship between mole and
volume fraction for hydrous methanol and hydrous ethanol is plot-
ted. This relationship can be important to keep in mind: adding
a  small volume  of  water  to  methanol  can  result  in  a  significant
change in the molar composition, e.g. 10% water by volume repre-
sents a mole fraction of 20%.

When considering the use of these mixtures in practical sys-
tems,  the  freezing  temperature  is  obviously  important.  Fig.  10
shows the effect on the freezing point of the resulting binary mix-
tures of adding methanol or ethanol to water. In Fig. 10 note that
methanol  has  a  greater  effect;  by  mass  25%  methanol  in  water
would suppress the freezing point of the resulting ADI mixture to
–21 °C. The equivalent value for ethanol in water is –15 °C. For the
50:50 water methanol mixture commonly used in ADI systems in

CFR test that were suggested some years later for determining octane numbers of
alcohols and alcohol blends [125] .

near-azeotropes  of  (m)ethanol  and  gasoline  components.  The  ef-
fect of the low molecular mass component eventually falls away
as more gasoline is added and the alcohol concentration drops to
zero.

As can be seen in Fig. 12 , the magnitude of the increase of RVP
is less pronounced with ethanol addition compared to methanol
addition. This is due to the lower vapour pressure and lower po-
larity of ethanol [127] .

This behaviour of the vapour pressure can influence the cold-
start performance of an engine and explains how evaporative emis-
sions using methanol and ethanol in high level blends can be lower
than those of gasoline while they can be higher using low level
blends [67] .

2.8.3. Distillation curve

The vaporization behaviour of a fuel is important in order to
ensure proper cold start and normal operation of the engine. For
U.S.  gasoline,  the  distillation  curve  has  to  meet  the  ASTM  stan-
dard D4814, with similar standards applying to other regions. 10
vol% of the fuel must be evaporated at a temperature of 70 ° (T10),
50 vol% between 77 and 121 ° (T50) and 90 vol% at a maximum
temperature of 190 ° (T90). The gasoline must be completely evap-
orated at a temperature of 225 °. The inclusion of large quantities
of a single component (in this case methanol) in a blend is known
to distort the distillation profile near to the boiling point of that
single component. The formation of near-azeotropes can cause fur-
ther distortions, as is known to be the case with methanol (and
ethanol). Because of the near-azeotropic behaviour, the distillation
does not occur as discrete segments of compounds but rather as
vaporization of mixtures with gradually varying composition and
with decreasing volatility [130] .

In Fig. 13 , the near-azeotropic behaviour of methanol-gasoline
blends is visible as a more slowly rising distillation curve indicat-
ing a lower volatility than that of the base gasoline. For increas-
ing methanol content, this slowly rising curve expands to cover a
larger portion of the distillation curve [130] . Note that for high-
level ethanol-gasoline blends, problems can arise because of the
low volatility at the front end of the distillation curve for low tem-
peratures. As mentioned earlier, because of the low volatility, the
ethanol  fraction  in  ‘E85’  blends  is  decreased  to  typically  70%  by
volume during winter months.

Other solutions could be adjusting the calibration of engine pa-
rameters or installing a second fuel tank with another fuel which
would be used during cold start. A second fuel tank makes the sys-
tem more complex and expensive but an additional gasoline fuel
tank is already used in Brazilian flex-fuel vehicles which are run-
ning on hydrous ethanol. Section 3 gives an overview of possible
engine-related changes to ensure cold start.

there is less difference because of the higher molecular mass of
these molecules.

2.8.2. Vapour pressure

The  most  commonly  used  measure  of  vapour  pressure  is  the
Reid vapour pressure (RVP), defined as the vapour pressure mea-
sured at 37.8 °C (100 °F) in a chamber with a vapour-to-liquid vol-
ume ratio of 4:1. This is an indication of the presence of very light
fractions that vaporize at low temperatures. Methanol and ethanol,
when  mixed  with  gasoline,  have  very  pronounced  peaks  in  RVP
around  10  vol%  alcohol  fraction  while  this  behaviour  diminishes
with increased alcohol chain length [127] . This is shown in Fig. 12 .
This non-intuitive behaviour of (m)ethanol-gasoline blends is a
consequence of molecular interactions between the gasoline com-
ponents and (m)ethanol. For an ideal mixture of components, the
vapour pressure would follow a molar concentration weighting and
the vapour pressure can be expressed by Raoult’s law:

(cid:5)

p =

p i x i

(6)

i  is the vapour
where p is the vapour pressure of the mixture, p
pressure of compound i and x
i is the mole fraction of compound
i. Solutions of methanol and/or ethanol in gasoline however be-
have as non-ideal mixtures. As explained earlier, when gasoline is
added to alcohol with increasing quantities, the hydrogen bonds
are  progressively  weakened  and  the  alcohol  starts  to  behave  as
a  low  molecular  mass  component  and  the  gasoline-alcohol  in-
teractions change [127] . The non-polar hydrocarbon molecules in
gasoline interfere with the intermolecular hydrogen bonding be-
tween the polar (m)ethanol molecules, and the (m)ethanol inter-
feres with molecular interactions between the gasoline hydrocar-
bons [67,128,129] . These interferences with intermolecular bonding
allow the respective molecules to more readily escape the liquid as
vapour, increasing vapour pressure, and result in the formation of

63

certain  hydrocarbons.  Similar  work  on  methanol-gasoline  blends
would be useful.

Note that Anderson et al. [59] point to the subtleties of inter-
preting results from RON and MON tests for alcohols: “the MON
test specifies the temperatures of the inlet air (38 °/ 100 °F) and
the air-fuel mixture (149 °/300 °F), whereas the RON test specifies
a higher temperature for the inlet air (nominally 52 °/125 °F) and
does not specify a temperature for the air-fuel mixture. This means
that the inherently beneficial high heats of vaporization of alcohols
are a factor in the RON test but not the MON.”

2.8.5. Density

Due to the way liquids having different molecular size group
together,  the  total  volume  of  a  blend  of  different  liquid  compo-
nents can be different from the sum of the volumes of the com-
ponents  prior  to  mixing.  The  volume  occupied  by  a  number  of
molecules depends on the molecules that surround them. This can
affect the density of alcohol-gasoline blends, especially when wa-
ter  addition  is  involved.  For  example,  when  1  mole  of  water  is
added to a large volume of water at 25 °, the volume increases
by  18  cm 3 .  When  1  mole  of  water  is  added  to  a  large  volume
of ethanol at 25 °, the volume increases by only 14 cm 3  because
of  the  higher  density  packing  of  the  water  molecules  [132] .  For
most applications involving anhydrous alcohol-gasoline blends, the
density  can  be  approximated  with  enough  accuracy  using  linear
combinations. Turner et al. [63] measured the density of different
ternary  gasoline-ethanol-methanol  blends,  discussed  in  the  next
Section, at 20 ° using a pycnometer. The measured densities were
observed to be near linear combinations of individual component
densities.

2.8.6. Water tolerance of methanol-gasoline blends

An  important  aspect  of  the  storage  of  fuels  is  that  the  fuel
must be stable. Contrary to methanol and ethanol, gasoline is not
miscible  with  water.  As  a  result,  blend  stability  and  by  exten-
sion  water  tolerance  are  important  factors  for  hydrous  alcohol-
gasoline blends. The major issue encountered when blending wa-
ter, methanol and gasoline is phase separation, the dispersion of
the blend in an aqueous and an organic liquid phase. Cold start
problems,  a  fluctuating  knock  resistance  and  a  suboptimal  map-
ping are the main disadvantages related to phase separation in a
vehicle’s fuel tank (with a lower octane gasoline layer on top and
a corrosive alcohol-water blend below).

The  water  tolerance  in  blends  is  the  amount  of  water  (vol-
ume percent) that a blend can dissolve before separating into two
phases  at  equilibrium.  Skinner  et  al.  [133]  pointed  out  that  the
tendency of water induced phase separation is a function of the
amount of water, the type of alcohol, the temperature and the al-
cohol/gasoline ratio. Qi et al. [134] produced critical phase sepa-
ration temperatures for a range of methanol/gasoline blends as a
function of water content, see Fig. 15 . The critical phase separa-
tion temperature of methanol-gasoline blends increases with the
amount  of  water  present  in  the  blend.  Additionally,  they  stated
that the addition of ethanol will reduce the phase separation tem-
perature. Donnelly et al. [135] concluded that, when as little as 0.1
vol% water is added to a M20 blend, phase separation can occur
at a temperature of 20 °C. Because of this very small water toler-
ance of the methanol-gasoline blend, water contamination during
methanol transport and storage has to be avoided.

In order to assist with the stability of methanol-gasoline blends,
other alcohols are often used. Qi and co-workers [134] discuss the
use  of  ethanol  specifically  as  a  co-solvent  in  methanol-gasoline
blends and show data on the stability limit with temperature. Pear-
son and Turner [23] later discussed an apparent irregularity in this
and proposed a minimum value and how it would relate to ternary
blends of gasoline, ethanol, and methanol.

ferent gasoline blendstocks. Measurements - symbols. Replotted from [131] .

2.8.4. RON/MON

Anderson  et  al.  [59]  studied  the  Research  Octane  Numbers
(RON)  and  Motor  Octane  Numbers  (MON)  of  gasoline-alcohol
blends and found that these properties behave non-linearly on a
volumetric basis but can be estimated to first order by calculat-
ing  the  average  of  the  octane  numbers  of  the  components  us-
ing the mole fraction. The difference between mole fraction and
volume fraction of methanol-gasoline and ethanol-gasoline blends
was  shown  in  Fig.  11 .  Because  the  octane  numbers  of  alcohol-
gasoline blends can be estimated using mole fractions, it follows
that the sensitivity, S = RON − MON, can also be estimated by mo-
lar weighting.

Still, the behaviour of the RON and MON is not completely lin-
ear with molar content as shown for ethanol in Fig. 14 [131] . An-
derson et al. [65] proposed to use a non-linear term to improve
the molar-weighted estimate of RON and MON values for ethanol-
gasoline blends because measured RON values were up to 3 RON
higher than values estimated by molar weighting. They explained
the  non-linear  behaviour  by  interactions  between  ethanol  and

and multi-component fuels, and for ‘binary’ blends of fuels, which
are themselves a blend of components, even at higher temperature
and pressure. Keeping in mind the uncertainties of both the lam-
inar burning velocity of the mixture and the laminar burning ve-
locity of the pure fuels, the authors concluded that the three pro-
posed mixing rules can be used in simulation models to calculate
the laminar burning velocity with acceptable accuracy.

Fig. 16.  Phase diagram of alcohol/water/gasoline mixtures. Reproduced from [32] .

Sileghem  [32]  used  Aspen  software  to  get  insights  into
the  phase  separation  process  of  alcohol-gasoline  blends.  The
UNIFAC-LiquidLiquid model was used to get qualitative results of
phase separation for gasoline-alcohol-water blends. For gasoline, a
toluene reference fuel (blend of iso-octane, n-heptane and toluene)
was used as representation of gasoline. In Fig. 16 , the results are
shown. The alcohol in the gasoline-alcohol-water blends is a mix-
ture of methanol and ethanol going from 100% methanol to 100 %
ethanol as can be seen in the Figure. Under the lines, the blend is
unstable and phase separation is expected. As expected from litera-
ture, blends with a high fraction of alcohol are more water tolerant
and addition of ethanol will reduce the chance of phase separation
[134,136] .

2.8.7. Burning velocities

Sileghem et al. [137] investigated the possibility to use simple
‘mixing rules’ to determine the laminar burning velocity (LBV) of
a  methanol-gasoline  blend  out  of  the  laminar  burning  velocities
of its components, methanol and gasoline. They evaluated differ-
ent mixing rules by comparing their results to measured as well
as computed data (using 1D chemical kinetic simulations) of blend
LBVs.

The evaluation showed that the blend’s LBV is not linear in the
blend composition, proven by poor predictions of the blend LBV
using mixing rules based on averaging by volume fraction or mass
fraction. Good predictions were obtained using the energy fraction
mixing rule, the mixing rule developed by Hirasawa et al. [138] ,
and a Le Chatelier’s rule based on the energy fraction. These three
mixing rules were reported to perform very well for binary, ternary

To illustrate this, the energy based mixing rule for estimating a

2.8.8. Autoignition delay time

In  Section  2.5 ,  we  described  the  autoignition  behaviours  of
methanol (single stage) and gasoline (two stage) separately. Fig. 17
displays the autoignition delay time τ as a function of tempera-
ture for methanol, gasoline, and two blends, as calculated by Yates
et al. [68] (lines). Gasoline is represented by primary reference fuel
(PRF) 80, which is a mixture of 80 vol% iso-octane and 20 vol%
n-heptane.  As  methanol  is  added  to  PRF80  in  Fig.  17 ,  the  cool-
flame temperature rise decreases and the NTC region gradually di-
minishes. Since autoignition in SI engines takes place at unburned
mixture  temperatures  between  750–900  K,  the  cool-flame  reac-
tions  are  the  prime  reason  for  the  lower  chemical  resistance  to
knock of gasoline compared to methanol [139] .

Sileghem  et  al.  [140]  investigated  the  possibility  of  deter-
mining  mixing  rules  for  predicting  autoignition  delay  times  of
methanol-gasoline blends. They used the empirical model of Yates
et al. [68] to calculate the ignition delays of blends of primary ref-
erence fuels and methanol. As discussed in the preceeding section,
the simplest mixing rules are based on mole, mass, volume or en-
ergy fraction. They found the mixing rules to over-predict the ig-
nition delay for lower temperatures because of the very different
values  for  the  ignition  delay  of  methanol  and  the  PRF  fuel  that

was used to simulate gasoline, due to the cool flame behavior of
the PRF fuel. They solved that by using logarithmic values of the
ignition delay as follows:

Fig. 18 , the binary mixture of gasoline and methanol is shown in
which all the ethanol is replaced with gasoline and methanol. This
results  in  a  M56  blend.  In  between  these  two  blends,  any  iso-
stoichiometric ternary blend can be determined by drawing a ver-
tical line in Fig. 18 and reading the blend ratios on the left axis of
the Figure (for example the dotted line in Fig. 18 ). In Fig. 18 , the
concept of iso-energetic GEM blends has been shown for equiva-
lent ‘E85’ blends, but iso-energetic GEM blends can be formulated
for any binary ethanol-gasoline blend. The limit case where all the
ethanol is removed and substituted by methanol and gasoline can
easily be calculated from Eq. 11 , i.e.  when V E /V = 0 :

Figure 17 shows the resulting ignition delays using the mixing
rule based on the energy fractions of the different fuels (symbols)
as, similar to what was observed for the mixing rules for the lami-
nar burning velocity of methanol-gasoline blends, the energy frac-
tion mixing rule was found to give the best agreement. This mixing
rule was then tested for engine simulations (see Section 7.1.4 ).

2.9. Properties of ternary blends

In order to have ternary blends which could have the potential
to be ‘drop-in’ fuels for binary ethanol blends in flex fuel vehicles
(see Section 1.6.2 ), two properties of the blends are absolutely nec-
essary: the blends should have very similar stoichiometric air-to-
fuel ratio and volumetric energy density as the target binary blend.
With nearly identical volumetric energy densities, the opening du-
ration of the fuel injectors can remain the same without the need
to recalibrate the ECU. The stoichiometric air-to-fuel ratio condi-
tion is required to not upset the ECU with signals from the lambda
sensor which are outside the expected range.

2.9.1. Volumetric relations

A simple expression can be derived to quantify the volume frac-
tions of methanol, gasoline and ethanol required to generate iso-
energetic  ternary  mixtures  [141] .  These  mixtures  have  the  same
volumetric energy density as a target binary blend of gasoline and
ethanol. The volume fraction of methanol as a function of the vol-
ume fraction of ethanol can be expressed as:

V M
V

=

V E
V

(ρE LH V E − ρG LH V G )
(ρG LH V G − ρM LH V M )

+

(ρG LH V G − ρLH V )
(ρG LH V G − ρM LH V M )

(11)

in which the subscripts ’G’, ’E’ and ’M’ stand for gasoline, ethanol
and methanol; ρ is the density and LHV is the lower heating value.
Using Eq. 11 , the concept of these ternary blends is shown in
Fig.  18  for  equivalent  ‘E85’  blends.  On  the  right  side  of  Fig.  18 ,
the composition of normal E85 can be seen. On the left side of

The possible deviation of the stoichiometric AFR from that of
the target binary blend can now be quantified for the iso-energetic
GEM blends, see Fig. 19 . As the AFR of the blends also depends
on the AFR of the gasoline which is used to formulate the blends,
the  AFR  ratios  of  E85  and  M56,  which  are  assumed  to  be  iso-
energetic, are plotted in Fig. 19 as a function of different gasolines
with changing AFR while assuming the other properties of the dif-
ferent gasolines stay equal. The deviation between the two limit-
ing binary GEM blends, E85 and M56, becomes larger as the AFR
of gasoline increases. The deviation is 1.7 % when the AFR ratio is
14.7 for gasoline and only 0.014 % for an AFR of 14.1. These devia-
tions should however never be a problem for the ECU.

2.9.2. Ternary blend properties

Turner  et  al.  [63,64,66]  found  that  all  the  possible  iso-
stoichiometric and iso-energetic ternary blends starting from a bi-
nary  blend  of  gasoline  and  ethanol  have,  beside  the  same  AFR
and identical volumetric energy content, essentially constant oc-
tane numbers and constant latent heat. The fact that these ternary
blends show very few differences in physical properties opens the
possibility to use these ternary blends as drop-in fuels for flex-fuel
vehicles without the danger of upsetting the on-board diagnostics
of the engine management system. The octane numbers of four dif-
ferent GEM blends, measured by Turner et al. [66] , are shown in
Fig. 20 . As can be seen, octane numbers do not vary much for the
different blends and therefore the sensitivity (RON-MON) is essen-
tially constant as well.

In a comprehensive study of GEM blend characteristics, Waqas
et  al.  [142]  investigated  the  autoignition  characteristics  of  GEM
blends in terms of their applicability to SI, HCCI and CI combus-
tion systems. Their investigation, using a modified CFR engine for
measurement  of  RON  and  HCCI  number  and  an  IQT  for  cetane
measurements, also included the effect of the composition of the
base gasoline used in the blend; this was in terms of base gasoline
RON (defined as being high if it was 84 RON and low at 70 RON)

and the aromatic concentration in the fuel. While they did not at-
tempt to match distillation curves, the use of fuel injection in their
modified CFR engine would have helped to suppress the effects of
this parameter. They related all of their results back to RON num-
bers. This comprehensive study determined that when high con-
centrations of alcohols were used the iso-stoichiometric blending
rule was valid regardless of the combustion mode tested provided
a  high  RON  base  fuel  was  used;  the  same  was  not  found  to  be
true if a low RON base gasoline was used. In this respect their re-
sults mirrored those of Anderson et al. for ethanol blends where
low gasoline blendstock octane numbers were found to give more
non-linearity of predicted blend RON and MON [131] , albeit that
the range of blendstock ONs used by Anderson et al. was different,
with a range of 88 to 95 RON.

In SI and CI mode, the aromatic content of the fuel was found
to have a non-linear effect on the iso-stoichiometric blending rule
but in HCCI combustion mode it was found to hold almost inde-
pendently  of  this.  The  alcohol  concentration  was  found  to  yield
some saturation at high levels in HCCI and CI operation, but this
was not the case for SI.

Generally then, from the work of researchers in the SI field, it
can be said that the RON of iso-stoichiometric GEM blends is in-
deed constant for conventional blendstock RONs of above 85 RON
or so, and hence methanol can be used to augment ethanol avail-
ability and help to displace fossil gasoline from the fuel pool.

The GEM blends have the potential to be used as drop-in alter-
natives to binary ethanol-gasoline blends such as E85 from a com-
bustion and control point of view but it is also important to un-
derstand their aggressivity towards materials, volatility properties,
blend stability, etc. This was investigated by Turner et al. [63] for
several GEM blends.

As  discussed  in  Section  2.8.3 ,  a  single  component  in  a  blend
will  distort  the  distillation  profile  around  the  boiling  point  of
that  single  component,  with  further  distortions  possible  due  to
azeotropic  behaviour.  For  different  E85-equivalent  GEM  blends,
Turner et al. [63] found that the biggest distortion for the front
end of the distillation curve (low temperatures) occurred for the
E85 blend (without methanol), indicating low volatility. With in-
creasing methanol content, the distillation curve approaches that
of  the  base  gasoline.  This  indicates  that  GEM  blends  containing
higher levels of methanol will be less compromised regarding cold
temperature startability.

higher  methanol  fractions  are  formulated  and  the  vapour  pres-
sures of methanol-gasoline blends are higher than the vapour pres-
sures of ethanol-gasoline blends, RVP increases as more methanol
is added in the GEM blends. This may lead to increased evapora-
tive emissions and overloaded carbon canister traps, especially for
GEM blends with lower alcohol content, e.g. such blends equivalent
to  E15  [63] .  Instead  of  standard  gasoline,  a  reformulated  blend-
stock for oxygenate blending or “RBOB” could be used to counter-
act these issues to some extent.

Qi  et  al.  [134]  investigated  the  blend  stability  of  methanol-
gasoline blends. At lower temperatures, a methanol-gasoline blend
can  become unstable (i.e.  phase-separate) and  ethanol was used
as a co-solvent in order to yield stable mixtures. The data of Qi
et al. [134] was corrected by Turner et al. [49] and is shown in
Fig.  21 .  This  data  at  –15 °C  shows  that  there  is  a  boundary  be-
tween stable and unstable mixtures and that the E85-equivalent
GEM blend without ethanol, M56, would not be stable. This sug-
gests that ethanol should always be used as a co-solvent in some
concentration in order to have stable mixtures.

The material compatibility issue is discussed in Section 3.2 .

3. Methanol engine and vehicle design features

3.1. Introduction

The properties of methanol and methanol blends, discussed in
Section 2 , necessitate some hardware changes to engines and vehi-
cles to be run on these fuels. Note that all vehicles currently on the
market, using gasoline engines, are able to run on low level blends,
i.e. where the methanol fraction falls within current gasoline spec-
ifications (e.g. in the case of EN228, up to 3 vol% of methanol).
The latter is very important: as discussed in Section 2.8.2 , blend-
ing methanol in with gasoline will increase the vapour pressure,
for low methanol concentrations. Thus, as is the case with ethanol,
for the blend to fall within gasoline vapour pressure specifications
it  is  required  to  change  the  formulation  of  the  base  gasoline.  A
‘splash blend’ will have a higher vapour pressure. One has to be
careful with some findings from literature, where this important
distinction  has  not  been  made.  For  example,  work  has  been  re-
ported on much higher diurnal losses of methanol, from a vehicle
fuelled with M15 [143] . However, this work used a splash blend,
probably explaining this result. Older vehicles (generally from be-
fore 2002) can develop problems even with these low level blends,
as the alcohol can act as a solvent, loosening deposits in the fuel-
ing system making blockages further down the line a possibility.

As the alcohol content decreases in alcohol-gasoline blends, the
RVP increases with a peak around 10-15 vol% (see Section 2.8.2 ).
Increased RVP has been linked to increased evaporative emissions.
Because  the  alcohol  content  decreases  when  GEM  blends  with

In  the  following,  hardware  changes  are  discussed  that  are
needed  when  running  on  mid  to  high  level  blends,  or  neat
methanol. Note that measures on the fuel-side are also possible:
additives are typically used to improve the fuel’s lubricity, reduce

carbon  residues,  increase  anti-corrosion  and  anti-rust  properties,
and protect certain metals [144] .

3.2. Material compatibility

Methanol’s polarity also leads to a well-known challenge con-
cerning material compatibility, which requires modifications to en-
gine fuel systems. Both metals as well as elastomers (soft compo-
nents used for seals and fuel lines) can be attacked by methanol, if
not chosen properly. This holds for all alcohols but with methanol
being the most aggressive agent while higher order alcohols form
less of an issue. However, even for methanol, work done in Cali-
fornia and elsewhere has demonstrated that there are no technical
hurdles to design compatible vehicles [52,145–147] . The material
compatibility of alcohol fuels has been the subject of many reviews
[145,146,148] . Some basic considerations are summarized below.

Generally, light alcohols are more corrosive to both ferrous and
non-ferrous  metals  than  gasoline.  The  polarity  of  methanol  and
ethanol causes dry corrosion, but often this corrosion is reinforced
by ionic impurities such as chloride ions in the fuel [146] . As alco-
hols are hygroscopic, dissolved or separated water molecules can
trigger wet corrosion phenomena. When using hydrous methanol
as a fuel, special attention should thus be paid to this. It has also
been documented that a combination of three contaminants (chlo-
ride ion, acetic acid, and ethyl acetate) produces a synergistic ef-
fect in hydrous ethanol, and any resulting corrosion is many times
greater than that by any single contaminant [149] .

Methanol is  electrically  conductive.  Corrosion  behaviours that
are dependent on conductive fluid behaviour, such as electrochem-
ical and galvanic corrosion, can be enhanced by an increase of the
alcohol  fuel’s  electrical  conductivity  due  to  absorbed  water  and
contaminants [146] .

Alcohol fuels can be extremely aggressive toward magnesium,
aluminium and copper. Steel and other ferrous metals are usually
only slightly affected [52] . It is interesting to note that the corro-
sion process is very sensitive to temperature, with most damage
occurring during hot soak cycles [147] . For components that are
in frequent contact with the fuel, austenitic stainless steel is often
used or other metals coated with a zinc or nickel alloy. Additives
and properly formulated engine oils have also been found to re-
duce corrosive effects in low level blends [52] .

Alcohol-rich  fuels  have  been  shown  to  cause  shrinkage,
swelling, hardening or softening of elastomers in the fuel system.
This is especially true for high level methanol blends. For these ap-
plications, alcohol-compatible elastomer classes are used such as
fluorocarbon elastomers or nitrile butadiene rubbers [146,147] . The
Methanol Institute provides technical bulletins on their website on
the suitability of elastomers and metals for neat methanol use [29] .
In  the  case  of  the  ternary  blends,  or  GEM  blends,  because
methanol has a lower molar volume than ethanol, it is expected
that the take up and swelling of elastomeric materials would in-
crease for GEM blends containing higher levels of methanol [150] .
Turner et al. [63] evaluated the elastomeric material swelling prop-
erties of three different elastomers using different GEM blends and
found that the blends containing higher levels of methanol indi-
cated more severe swelling. Turner et al. stated that materials typ-
ical for M85 applications can be used with any GEM blend because
none of the blends indicated more swelling than M85.

As a closing remark on material compatibility, it must be noted
that  alcohol  refueling  systems  at  the  service  stations  must  also
be designed with care. Tanks, pumps, lines and spigots should be
alcohol-compatible. The California Energy Commission has identi-
fied the design elements for methanol compatibility [52] . Fuel line
compatibility in service station equipment was one of the few po-
tential issues identified at the end of the Californian M85 trial [19] .

3.3. Cold start

Cold starting of very high blend alcohols in gasoline has long
been challenging. This is symptomatic of the fact that the light al-
cohols do not form an ignitable mixture at STP; indeed, this is a
reason why they are inherently more safe than gasoline.

To successfully start a cold engine, there are two prerequisites.
A combustible fuel-air mixture is required at spark timing and the
combusted  mixture  needs  to  generate  enough  work  to  keep  the
engine running. For light alcohols these conditions are not always
met for various reasons (see Table 3 ) [23,86,145] :

• Because  of  their  lower  energy  density  more  mass  needs  to

evaporate.

• The higher heat of vaporization means more energy is needed

to evaporate the fuel.

• The  lower  flammability  limit  of  methanol  (and  ethanol)  is

higher than for gasoline.

• Although the saturated vapour pressure of alcohols is slightly
higher than for gasoline, their low stoichiometric AFR means a
much  higher vapour  pressure is  needed to  obtain a  stoichio-
metric mixture.

• Methanol and ethanol are single component fuels with a sin-
gle, defined boiling point. Unlike gasoline they do not contain
volatile components that can improve cold startability.

• The conductivity of light alcohols can cause short circuiting be-

tween the spark electrodes if not all fuel has evaporated.

This is illustrated in Fig. 22 , where isooctane is used as a sur-
rogate for gasoline, and in this figure it can be seen that both of
the alcohols are significantly leaner than the alkane; it is interest-
ing that methanol is actually significantly closer to being ignitable
than ethanol at 0 °C (by about one ‘lambda’ unit).

Nakata et al., in a study of the cold startability of ethanol com-
pared its performance to that of methanol and isooctane. There re-
sults reinforce the above observations: methanol starts much faster
than ethanol (and in fact almost as quickly as gasoline); isooctane
was easily the fastest starter [86] . Related to all of the above is
the fact that when 15% gasoline is added to methanol, its ignitabil-
ity is lowered from being close to that of diesel to about halfway
to that of gasoline [53] . This reinforces the earlier observations of
Ingamells  and  Lindquist  who  reported  that  “cold  starting  is  not
a problem with methanol/gasoline mixtures containing up to 40%
methanol” [151] .

Cold start nevertheless is a well-known issue with alcohol en-
gines  and  many  solutions  have  been  developed  over  the  years.
These can be roughly divided as either focusing on the fuel or on
the  engine  operation.  Solutions  focusing  on  the  fuel  include  the

68

use of additives such as highly volatile gasoline, butane or pen-
tane, dissociation of methanol to hydrogen and CO or conversion
of methanol to dimethylether. The latter two solutions require ad-
ditional fuel conversion systems and energy (see Section 6 ).

More recent solutions tend to focus on the engine operation,
minimizing the need for additional systems. Various components
can be optimized for cold startability:

• engine block: The engine block and intake can be electrically

heated to reduce cold start problems [18,152] .

• injector:  Fuel  temperature  has  been  shown  to  be  a  decisive
factor  in  the  vapour  formation  of  alcohols  [153] ,  so  heating
the fuel rail or individual injectors is often applied to improve
startability. Compared to fuel temperature, the air temperature
is  only  of  secondary  importance  [154,155] .  Injection  duration
can be increased in order to obtain a rich, combustible mixture,
but this will also worsen CO and HC emissions [153] . Addition-
ally, elevating the injection pressure can improve atomization
and vaporization of the spray. Fuel puddling on the intake or
cylinder structure can be minimized by injecting the mixture
during the intake stroke.

• valves: Some authors have investigated the effect of valve tim-
ing on cold startability and found that both intake and exhaust
timings can be optimized to this end [86,155] . For example, a
retarded intake valve opening will lead to more underpressure
in the cylinder, increasing the velocity at which air is aspirated,
which aids evaporation. This effect can be augmented by reduc-
ing the maximum valve lift or deactivating one intake valve.
• cranking  rpm:  Brusstar  et  al.  found  that  increasing  the
cranking rpm improves startability through a higher effective
compression  ratio  and  air  velocity  [156] .  Conversely  Colpin
et  al.  [155]  and  Aikawa  et  al.  [157]  found  no  significant  im-
provement and stated that the cranking rpm of 1500 used by
Brusstar et al. is not realistic.

• ignition: Ignition timing can be adapted during cold start. The
use of multiple sparks can sometimes be beneficial. Some au-
thors  have  proposed  special  plasma  jet  forming  spark  plugs
to improve startability, but this has never been implemented
[158] .

• direct injection: Stratification and late injection are very effec-
tive strategies to improve cold start performance. Siewart and
Groff reported successful cold starts at temperatures below –29
°C for methanol and other fuels [159] . More recently, Marriot
et al. [160] confirmed that these injection strategies solve the
cold start issue.

for alcohols. A classical solution consists of reducing this tempera-
ture by choosing a lower heat grade spark plug [152] .

Other factors are important as well. Suga et al. assessed the pre-
ignition  tendency  in  an  M85  engine  using  different  spark  plugs
of identical heating range [162] . They found that a configuration
using  platinum-tipped  electrodes  was  highly  susceptible  to  pre-
ignition and hypothesized that noble metals can catalyze a reaction
in which methanol dissociates through formaldehyde to CO and H
2
which then autoignites (see also Section 6 ). The high pre-ignition
tendency with spark plugs using noble metals was confirmed by
Pearson et al. [23] and Bergström et al. [18] . These authors further
reduced  the  electrode  temperatures  by  using  copper-cored  elec-
trodes,  which  do  not  cause  autocatalysis,  effectively  eliminating
pre-ignition risks for most conditions.

3.5. Engine cylinder head and peripherals

The  greatly  increased  evaporation  cooling  when  fueling
methanol in the intake ports can lead to very cold temperatures
in the intake. This leads to increased thermomechanical stress in
the head and countermeasures may be required [18] .

Standard valves and valve seat inserts suffer from increased re-
cession during alcohol operation. This occurs because alcohols are
non-lubricating  and  their  combustion  produces  less  ‘lubricating’
soot. Additionally they experience higher contact forces due to in-
creased combustion pressures and thermal shocks due to signifi-
cant cooling of the inlet valve by fuel evaporation [18] . Solutions
usually comprise of increasing the hardness and chrome content
of the materials [163,164] .

Because of the increased knock resistance of methanol, ignition
retard is usually not needed to alleviate knock at maximum power,
and this can lead to significantly increased peak cylinder pressures.
Ignition retard might then be necessary, not for knock suppression
but to keep engine operation within the allowable peak pressure
range. If one wants to take advantage of the higher knock resis-
tance of methanol, the higher peak pressures as well as the ther-
mal stresses due to significant evaporation cooling call for adjust-
ments to the base engine’s structure and cylinder head. The result-
ing lower exhaust temperatures make application of variable ge-
ometry turbines more easy [156] .

Similarly,  should  one  develop  a  dedicated  methanol  engine,
variable  valve  timing  systems  should  be  revisited  since  due  to
methanol’s higher dilution tolerance it might be beneficial to have
a  wider  timing  window  to  take  advantage  of  increased  internal
EGR rates.

Finally,  note  that  dedicated  methanol  engines  would  have  an
increased compression ratio which would at least partly alleviate
the cold start issue.

3.6. Vehicle adaptations

3.4. Ignition and fueling systems

The lower volumetric energy content of methanol, and by ex-
tension blends containing a substantial methanol fraction, requires
fuel pumps and injectors with an increased flow capacity, other-
wise peak power cannot be maintained. Obviously, material com-
patibility  issues  also  hold  for  pump  and  injector  internals  (see
Section 3.2 ).

Concerning spark plugs, light alcohols and methanol in particu-
lar have been shown to be more easily pre-ignited by hot spots
in  the  combustion  chamber,  relative  to  gasoline.  The  low  mini-
mum ignition energy (see Table 3 ) and the thinner flame thickness
arising from the faster LBV [161] , makes methanol susceptible to
pre-ignition. As methanol produces non-sooting flames, the igni-
tion source is usually an overheated spark plug electrode, and not
some combustion deposit. Typical electrode temperatures are be-
tween 700 and 925 °C, which is acceptable for gasoline, but not so

As discussed in Section 2.2 , increased aldehyde emissions may
arise from methanol operation. Combined with the cold start chal-
lenge discussed earlier, specific catalyst formulations may be nec-
essary. To reduce catalyst light-off times, closed-coupled catalysts
or  electrically  heated  catalysts  have  sometimes  been  used  [152] .
Unfortunately, the literature on catalysts for methanol vehicles is
limited  and  dates  back  to  the  1990s.  Some  performance  figures
were  published,  but  actual  catalyst  formulations  were  not  dis-
closed. For example, EPA tested 2 catalysts provided by manufac-
turers and found up to 95% reduction of formaldehyde emissions
over  the  FTP  cycle  [165] .  Clearly,  given  the  enormous  change  in
emission  legislation  over  the  past  25  years,  this  is  an  area  that
needs investigation.

Obviously, to counteract the reduced volumetric energy density,
a larger fuel tank is needed if the driving range is to be preserved.
As a simple example, assuming identical overall efficiency, a vehi-
cle equipped as standard with a 60 liter gasoline tank would need
to be able to store an additional 60 liter of methanol (methanol

S. Verhelst et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 70 (2019) 43–88

69

having half the volumetric energy density as gasoline, see Table 2 ).
This translates to an additional 47 kg of vehicle mass when fully
fuelled. This would be the most extreme case – when using blends
instead of pure methanol the required additional volume would be
lower, with the exact value depending on the blend level. Concern-
ing evaporative emissions, a carbon canister of similar size as for
gasoline vehicles has been found to be sufficient 8 .

4. Spark ignition engine experiments

Here, we discuss how methanol’s properties translate to SI en-
gine power output, efficiency and emissions. Note that low level
blends,  falling  within  gasoline  specifications,  are  not  discussed.
Again, it is worth pointing out that caution is needed when con-
sulting results from work using splash blends, i.e. where gasoline
and methanol have been mixed by the authors. This usually uses
pump gasoline not tailored to the introduction of methanol in the
fuel blend, resulting in increased volatility (see Section 2.8.2 ) and
possibly issues with evaporative emissions.

Results  obtained  using  ternary  (or  GEM)  blends  are  dis-
cussed  in  Section  4.2 ,  methanol–water  blends  in  Section  4.3 .
Section  4.4  treats  work  where  methanol,  or  a  methanol-water
blend, is used as a second fuel to suppress high load knock.

4.1. Mid to high level blends and pure methanol

The potential for increased engine performance and efficiency
has been extensively validated experimentally [23,145] . Published
work indicates that the level of improvement compared to gaso-
line operation mainly depends on whether the methanol is used
in a dedicated or a flex-fuel engine. To illustrate this, some rele-
vant experimental work on neat methanol and high level methanol
blends is discussed below.

4.1.1. Dedicated methanol engines

Obviously, the best results are obtained in dedicated methanol
engines.  Even  the  first  generation  of  M85  engines  featured  con-
siderable advances in power and efficiency, mainly thanks to the
increased  knock  resistance  of  methanol.  This  resistance  enabled
them to reach MBT spark timing (Minimum spark advance for Best
Torque)  over  a  wide  range  of  operation  points  and  allowed  the
compression  ratio  to  be  raised  to  12:1  and  above.  For  example,
the 1981 M85 Ford Escort produced 20% more power while being
15% more efficient relative to its gasoline equivalent [20] . Clemente
et al. reported similar figures for a more recent dedicated ethanol
engine designed for the Brazilian market [166] .

Recent work on modern alcohol engines has demonstrated fur-
ther  potential  for  increasing  efficiency  and  performance.  Nakata
et al. used E100 in a high compression ratio (13:1) naturally aspi-
rated port-fuel injected SI engine [86] . They were able to run MBT
timing and found that engine torque increased by 20% compared
with  operation  on  92  RON  gasoline.  The  full-load  brake  thermal
efficiency at 2800 rpm was 39.6% and 31.7% on E100 and gasoline
respectively. Even in operating points that were not knock limited,
efficiency  improvements  of  over  3%pt  were  possible  due  to  the
benefits of faster flame speed and lower heat losses using ethanol.
This is supported by work by Marriott et al. [160] .

Apart from the benefits induced by knock resistance, the ele-
vated burning velocity and wider flammability limits of light alco-
hols open up some alternative options for load control, especially
for  methanol  [148,167] .  Pannone  et  al.  [168]  have  published  re-
sults from an experimental turbocharged lean-burn methanol en-
gine. The reported BTEs were up to 14% better relative to stoichio-
metrically fuelled engines with throttled load control. The tailpipe

8

NO x  penalty of the lean burn strategy reached up to 150%, mak-
ing the practical use of such a strategy questionable without ad-
vanced aftertreatment such as a lean-NO x trap. Similarly, while Li
et  al.  [169]  report  indicated  efficiencies  of  over  50%  on  a  heavy
duty directly injected SI engine using a compression ratio of 16:1
and stratification, they do not discuss implications for emissions
and aftertreatment, and fail to mention the overall equivalence ra-
tio.

More interesting is to exploit the wider dilution limits of al-
cohols in a strategy using stoichiometric fueling and EGR to con-
trol the load, thus reducing throttling losses and enabling the use
of a three-way catalyst for aftertreatment. Brusstar et al. demon-
strated  this  using  a  1.9  l.  turbocharged  diesel  engine  with  a  CR
of 19.5:1 that was converted for SI operation on methanol [156] .
The high compression ratio enabled peak brake thermal efficien-
cies higher than the baseline diesel engine (40%) for operation on
methanol (42%). Similar peak BTEs were obtained earlier by Koenig
et al. on a dedicated methanol engine with a compression ratio of
12:1 [170] . Elevated levels of cooled EGR (up to 50%) were used to
reduce knock and pre-ignition concerns and spread the high effi-
ciency regions to part-load operating points. Throttleless operation
was possible down to a BMEP of 6 bar. Similar work by Brusstar
and Gray on a converted 4.5L V6 diesel engine established throttle-
less operation down to 4 bar BMEP on pure methanol [171] .

The work of Brusstar et al. was repeated by Ghent University re-
searchers on an identical VW TDI diesel engine with a compression
ratio of 19.5:1 [172] . This engine was converted to methanol oper-
ation by adding spark plugs, port fuel injection and a cooled EGR
loop. Two operating strategies with stoichiometric combustion of
methanol were compared on the engine: normally aspirated throt-
tled operation and turbocharged WOT operation with EGR. Mea-
surements were done at loads between 3.31 and 11.60 bar BMEP.
In much of the high load points, the spark timing had to be re-
tarded using the throttled operating strategy due to knock. For the
WOT EGR strategy this was not the case thanks to the cooling ef-
fect of EGR and throttleless operation was possible down to 3.3
bar BMEP thanks to the high burning rate of methanol without un-
acceptable cycle-to-cycle variations (which the authors defined as
CoV  <  10%, which is a rather high limit). This corresponded to an
EGR tolerance of nearly 50% EGR by mass.

Fig. 23 compares the BTE obtained using the throttled stoichio-
metric strategy (left) to that obtained using the turbocharged WOT
EGR strategy (right). Both peak brake thermal efficiency and part
load efficiencies can be seen to be considerably higher when us-
ing  the  WOT  EGR  strategy.  The  same  value  for  peak  BTE  (42%)
when employing the WOT EGR strategy on a similar engine was
reported  by  Brusstar  et  al.,  as  mentioned  above.  These  results
demonstrate that methanol can be used in dedicated engines with
diesel-like efficiencies while still operating stoichiometrically. As a
result, diesel-like efficiencies while still using cheap aftertreatment
(TWC) are possible.

The results on the converted VW TDI engine were also used to
determine to what extent these operating conditions stand over an
entire drive cycle [173] . The analysis was done using Lotus Vehicle
Simulation [174] and was based on the steady state experimental
results described above. Compared to stoichiometric throttled con-
trol, the WOT EGR strategy reduced CO
2 emissions by 23 g/km on
the NEDC (corresponding to 18%) and 43 g/mi on the FTP75 cycle
(corresponding to 20%). The CO
2 reduction was entirely due to effi-
ciency improvements enabled by the WOT/EGR strategy (see Figure
2.29), that could be applied even at low loads, so its advantages are
noticeable throughout the driving cycles.

4.1.2. Flexible fuel vehicles

In the first generation of FFVs (1990s) the knock resistance of
alcohols could not be exploited as the compression ratio had to

metric operation. Right - WOT EGR operation.

be low enough to ensure reliable operation on gasoline. Still, these
vehicles attained about 5% more power and efficiency in alcohol
mode thanks to increased volumetric efficiency, lower flow losses
and  more  isochoric  combustion  [145] .  Experiments  in  the  1970s
for  neat  methanol  showed  improvements of  around  8%  and  12%
in brake thermal efficiency and power respectively, for an engine
with a compression ratio of 8.2:1 [170] .

In  more  recent  flex-fuel  engines  a  combination  of  pressure
charging and active knock control (by aggressive spark retarding)
enable the exploitation of the anti-knock properties of light alco-
hols  without  sacrificing  the  ability  to  run  on  gasoline.  However,
only few experimental engine data of flex-fuel engines running on
methanol  have  been  published.  Vancoillie  et  al.  [175]  converted
two gasoline engines to operation on alcohol fuels: a port fuel in-
jected 4 cylinder 1.8 L production engine and a port fuel injected
single cylinder research engine. A comparison of methanol against
gasoline on these two flexible-fuel engines confirmed the poten-
tial for relative power and efficiency benefits up to 10%. Engine-out
CO
X levels dropped by 10% and 5-10 g/kWh respectively,
while the other harmful emissions did not change significantly.

2 and NO

Sileghem  et  al.  [176]  have  presented  measurements  on  a  di-
rect  injected  4-cylinder  Hyundai  2.4L  engine  fueled  with  pure
methanol, ethanol, gasoline and butanol. For the non-knock-limited
operating points, methanol had better efficiency compared to the
other fuels but the biggest differences were seen for the knock-
limited operating points. For methanol, there was an improvement
of 2.7 percentage points on average at 2.66 and 4 bar BMEP com-
pared to gasoline, which were non-knock-limited operating points.
For the knock-limited case at 150 Nm and 1500 rpm (8 bar BMEP)
this difference increased to 5.6 percentage points with the brake
thermal  efficiency  on  methanol  reaching  almost  40%  which  re-
2 emissions of 20.7% compared to gaso-
sulted in a decrease in CO
line.

Recently, Nguyen et al. [177] have published a comparison be-
tween gasoline and pure methanol used in a Volvo T3 engine. This
is  a  four  cylinder,  turbocharged  DISI  engine.  Next  to  a  compari-
son of the efficiency and emissions on gasoline and methanol, the
maximum output of the engine on gasoline and methanol was ex-
plored following a design of experiments approach with two con-
trol parameters: valve timing and intake boost pressure. With this
approach, the maximum BMEP that could be reached on gasoline
was 16.3 bar. The ignition timing at this output had to be retarded

on gasoline operation due to knock occurrence. For methanol oper-
ation however, optimal ignition timing could be used at every op-
erating point. This resulted in a brake thermal efficiency of 30.1%
and 37.9% on gasoline and methanol respectively, for this output.
On methanol, using higher boost pressure, the output could be in-
creased to over 20bar BMEP without having knock limitation is-
sues. However, at these operation points, the maximum allowed
(because of mechanical strength limitations) in-cylinder pressure
of 100 bar was exceeded. Nguyen et al. [177] estimated that, if the
maximum in-cylinder pressure is limited to 100 bar, the maximum
output would be 18.2 bar BMEP on methanol and that the addi-
tional  downsizing  potential  of  methanol  was  10.7%  compared  to
gasoline.

Whereas advantages in power density and efficiency are clear
with the use of methanol, results concerning emissions are con-
fusing.  Wei  et  al.  [87]  ran  a  small  gasoline  engine  on  gaso-
line,  and  various  methanol  blends  (splash  blended).  They  noted
that engine-out emissions of unburned methanol primarily were
a function of exhaust temperature, with no such emissions when
exhaust temperatures were high. Tailpipe emissions of unburned
methanol were negligible when the three way catalyst was operat-
ing at a minimum temperature of 270 °C. Their study also showed
formaldehyde emissions to actually be higher on gasoline in some
operating points, and at high speeds the three way catalyst seemed
to produce formaldehyde. The latter is behaviour that was reported
by Johnson Matthey in the 1990s to potentially occur, caused by
the partial oxidation of unburned methanol in the catalyst [178] .

Concerning  particle  number  (PN)  concentrations,  very  limited
data is available, that seems to suggest PN emissions to first de-
crease for low level blends and then increase for mid level blends,
to levels higher than gasoline [57,179] . Different hypotheses are of-
fered  to  explain  this  (increased  oil  dilution  by  the  fuel,  for  the
PFI  engine  in  [179] ;  flash  boiling  and  consequently  poor  mix-
ture preparation, for the DI engine in [57] ) but clearly this needs
more  investigation.  Piston  wetting  due  to  longer  injection  dura-
tions might also be a contributing factor for the higher level blends

crease [181] . In the latter case, this was for mid-level blends, used
in a gasoline vehicle without recalibration. Given the higher burn-
ing velocity of methanol (see Section 2 ), the ignition timing (op-
timized for gasoline) would probably have been too advanced, re-

71

Also, given the decreased energy content of the mid-level blend
it is unlikely that the engine control unit could keep the equiv-
alence ratio at stoichiometry, affecting both engine-out emissions
and aftertreatment efficiency. Other work also reported an increase
in NO
X even for a low level blend [143] , however, a splash blend
was used in a gasoline engine without any recalibration.

4.2. GEM blends

The  hypothesis  that  iso-stoichiometric  ternary  blends  of
methanol, ethanol and gasoline can be used as drop-in fuels for
spark-ignited flex-fuel engines has also been investigated on en-
gine  test  benches.  Sileghem  et  al.  [97,176]  evaluated  the  perfor-
mance of different GEM blends on a naturally aspirated 1.8L en-
gine  with  port  fuel  injection  and  a  direct  injected  2.4L  engine.
On the 1.8L engine, four different GEM blends were investigated:
two  ternary  blends  and  two  binary  blends,  E85  and  the  iso-
stoichiometric  methanol-gasoline  blend.  The  hypothesis  that  all
iso-stoichiometric blends have similar brake thermal efficiency was
confirmed as all values fell within the experimental uncertainty.

On the DI engine only the two iso-stoichiometric binary blends,
E85  and  M56,  have  been  studied  by  Sileghem  et  al.  as  it  was
expected that the results of the ternary iso-stoichiometric blends
would fall in between the results of these two binary blends. After
performing measurements on E85, all parameters regarding injec-
tion (start of injection and injection pressure) and ignition were
kept the same for the measurements on M56. The ECU data was
used  to  investigate  if  there  could  be  a  significant  difference  be-
tween these two blends with very similar fuel properties. At the
low load cases, 2.66 and 4 bar BMEP, only for one operating point
(engine speed variation), the difference in injection duration be-
tween E85 and M56 was larger than 1%. For the medium load case,
8 bar BMEP, the differences were larger but still only 2.7% at max-
imum which would cause no issues for the ECU.

4.3. Methanol-water blends

As mentioned in Section 1.3 , it can be economically attractive
if the methanol fuel can be allowed to contain water. Engine tests
have therefore been reported using methanol-water blends.

Clearly an important consideration with such mixtures in com-
bustion systems is the implications for ignition robustness and ex-
tinction of the flame, although Most and Longwell [124] did suc-
cessfully  operate  their  engine  on  mixtures  up  to  30%  water,  re-
porting that for any given operable equivalence ratio, an increase
X  emissions  at  a  constant  CR  and
in  water  content  reduced  NO
spark  advance  of  12:1  and  14 °btdc  respectively.  They  also  show
that  under  the  same  conditions  the  addition  of  water  generally
increased specific energy consumption (i.e. decreased brake ther-
mal efficiency BTE), while still being better than isooctane up to
20% water in methanol; however in a test with pure methanol in-
creased CR showed a large improvement in BTE. Thus there ap-
pears to be some further potential in BTE for methanol-water mix-
tures with higher CR.

Sileghem et al. [182] measured the effects of water content in
methanol, on a PFI engine. They tested blends with up to 10 vol%
of  water  and  compared  them  to  operation  on  neat  methanol  as
well as on gasoline, for low to medium engine speeds and loads.
The water-containing blends showed essentially the same BTE as
the pure methanol operation, which itself resulted in a 1 to 2 per-
centage points increase in BTE compared to gasoline operation. The
main reasons for this improvement are the higher burning velocity
of methanol and the lower cooling losses due to the high heat of
vaporization and high heat capacity of methanol and water.

They also found NO

X emissions to be lowered for the methanol-
water  blends  compared  to  neat  methanol  operation,  concurrent

with the expected decreases in in-cylinder temperatures and adi-
abatic flame temperature (and offsetting the expected increase in
X forma-
combustion duration, prolonging the time available for NO
tion).

4.4. Octane on demand

A significant new avenue for light alcohols in combustion sys-
tems is that of ‘octane on demand’ (OOD), the concept of which is
to use a relatively low-octane fuel by itself for much of the oper-
ating  map,  and  to  introduce  a  second  fuel  as  an  octane  booster
at  higher  loads,  providing  the  necessary  knock  suppression  to  a
tailored degree only when it is required. In its recent incarnation
the concept was first conceived by Ethanol Boosting Systems (EBS)
who  originally  suggested  PFI  of  low-octane  gasoline  with  direct
injection  of  ethanol,  seeking  not  only  to  utilize  the  high  ON  of
ethanol but also its high latent heat in order to extend the knock
limit [183,184] . In reality there are some synergies between this
and with what was termed ‘anti-detonant injection’ (ADI) in pis-
ton aircraft engines, where typically a 50:50 water:methanol mix-
ture was introduced while operating at high boost pressures at low
altitudes to provide knock suppression while generating maximum
power, for instance at take-off [185] .

There may be benefits in terms of mixing water with an alco-
hol as an octane enhancer/knock suppressor. This clearly combines
aspects of OOD and water injection and brings the concept back
to the original use of ADI on piston aircraft engines. Making use
of infinite miscibility of the two fluids, Berni et al. have performed
calculations using 25%, 50% and 75% by mass methanol-water mix-
tures in a PFI delivery system in a turbocharged V8 engine, em-
ploying gasoline in the DI system [186] . Here there are similarities
with the work of Morganti and co-workers [10,11] . Berni et al. re-
ported that the methanol makes the ADI mixture evaporate faster
and show the best results with 25% methanol in their full-load in-
vestigation. Gasoline consumption is significantly reduced by 17–
19%. This concept may also have synergies with water injection,
recently discussed by Böhm et al. as a knock suppressant [187] , in-
sofar as, in addition to potentially making water evaporate faster,
the methanol can also suppress freezing of the water in a vehicle-
mounted storage tank, a problem highlighted in related work by
Böhm et al. [188] . This concept is being studied at the moment
by other workers, and to illustrate the potential of this approach
Fig. 10 showed the effect on the freezing point of the resulting bi-
nary mixtures of adding methanol or ethanol to water.

The  use  of  a  pure  alcohol  as  an  octane  booster  for  automo-
tive use was investigated early on by Porter in a dual-fuel carbu-
retted engine [17] . Both ethanol and methanol were investigated
as octane boosters, and a vacuum switchover system was used in
the carburetter. In comparison tests with isooctane for the octane
booster methanol was found to give slightly higher power, which
he believed was due to an improvement in volumetric efficiency
(the  same  spark  advance  apparently  being  used  for  both  tests).
This result was despite an enleanment being forced at high loads
when using methanol because of inadequate flow rates in the car-
buretter.  Bromberg  and  Cohn  compared  the  use  of  ethanol  as  a
knock  suppressant  to  methanol  using  direct  injection  and  found
that methanol has a much greater effect in terms of the fraction
of fuel energy supplied which would translate to a lower volumet-
ric usage [189] . They also suggested that when the high ONs of the
alcohols were combined with their high latent heats, their effective
ONs rose significantly in OOD applications; they reported ethanol
having a calculated equivalent ON of 160, and methanol 180. In re-
cent work, Cohn and Bromberg have investigated the potential of a
dual PFI (gasoline/alcohol) system as an alternative to a HD diesel
engine [190] .

Whitaker et al. reported tests performed in an OOD engine us-
ing the EBS approach with direct-injected E85 as the knock sup-
pressant,  and  showed  that  for  a  given  volume  of  available  E85,
proportionally more gasoline can be displaced with the approach
than if an engine were to be globally fuelled on E85 (i.e. monova-
lent operation on the alcohol fuel) [191] . Their results showed that
over 10 0 0 miles of the US Metro-Highway Cycle, an EBS V8 engine
would displace 5.2 times as much gasoline as the E85 used. Con-
versely, if operation on E85 alone were compared with gasoline,
the relative consumptions would be aligned with the volumetric
energy  contents  of  the  fuels  (i.e.  42%  more  E85  would  be  used
than  gasoline).  Thus,  given  that  nowhere  near  sufficient  ethanol
can be manufactured to supply E85 for all vehicles, the OOD ap-
proach would have a better gasoline displacement effect.

More recently, significant further experimental research into the
OOD  concept  has  been  conducted  using  pure  alcohols  as  knock
suppressants. Daniel and co-workers presented results which show
that per unit of energy supplied, methanol was a slightly better
knock suppressant than ethanol, with significantly less volume re-
quirement  [15] ;  this  supports  the  work  of  Bromberg  and  Cohn
[184] . In their work, the alcohol was supplied via a DI fuel sys-
tem and gasoline via a PFI system. They showed better emissions
for the OOD approach, too. In a study intended to show that OOD
can facilitate the use of less refined, lower-octane fuels to the ben-
efit of overall system CO
2 emissions, Morganti et al. have presented
significant studies using methanol as an octane enhancer [10,11] . In
a significant departure to other work they utilized the pure hydro-
carbon fuels in their DI system and methanol in a PFI system, rea-
soning that since the hydrocarbon is used all of the time, whatever
benefit can be accrued from its latent heat and DI injection timing
should be made available to the combustion system continuously.
They showed major improvements in efficiency, both for the en-
gine and the overall fuel and engine system, although there was
a significant interaction with the overall RON of the ‘main’ fuel.
The use of less-refined fuels (they tested two forms of naphtha and
a gasoline blendstock) led to an improvement of the hydrocarbon
hydrogen-carbon ratio in that part of the energy delivery, which
with the benefits of the methanol as well, led to marked reduc-
tions in CO
2 emissions across the operating map. They also show
improvements in emissions are possible.

In related work, Bourhis et al. have begun a programme to cre-
ate a vehicle demonstrator using ethanol as the octane enhancer.
To date they have used monovalent DI fuelling but with various
volumetric blends of hydrocarbons and octane boosters to estab-
lish an octane requirement map. The octane boosters described in
[12] were ethanol, a proprietary blend of butanol and other com-
ponents, and a reformate stream. Of these, ethanol was found to
be the best. In later work, by fitting a PFI rail to a production DI
engine they showed that “As a general rule, it can be seen that the
lower octane booster consumption is obtained at low loads with
the  base-fuel  in  GDI  mode  whereas  it  is  the  opposite  at  higher
loads  (octane  booster  in  GDI  mode).  This  is  consistent  with  the
better anti-knock properties conferred by GDI versus PFI, mainly
due to the evaporative cooling effect” [13] .

In a comprehensive study of the octane on demand concept us-
ing  low-octane  naphtha  as  the  base  fuel,  Chang  and  co-workers
[192] investigated the use of methanol, MTBE, and ETBE as the oc-
tane booster component, and found that of these methanol was the
best choice. This was considered to be due in part to its very high
latent heat. In related work using methanol as the octane booster,
Viollet and co-workers [193] studied whether it was better to in-
troduce  it  via  the  DI  system  of  an  engine  and  the  naphtha  via
PFI or vice-versa; they determined that the optimum was to inject
it through DI using relatively late injection, suggesting that some
stratification of the resulting charge would cause a faster overall
charge  burn  rate  to  assist  in  suppressing  knock.  Chang  and  co-

workers also studied the well-to-wheels fossil carbon intensity of
the approach, determining that the result depended on the source
used to make the octane booster, but as long as coal was avoided
as  the  feedstock  to  synthesize  it  methanol  was  the  best  choice
[192] .

Thus from the experimental work carried out one can conclude
that the alcohols make excellent octane boosters for OOD concepts,
and  generally  one  sees  that  methanol  is  marginally  more  effec-
tive than ethanol [194] . There is scope to use a cheaper or more-
simply refined hydrocarbon stream for the main fuel, but clearly
this  would  be  a  problem  in  any  transitional  phase  as  the  tech-
nology was introduced. Instead, using existing standard but rela-
tively low-octane gasoline fuels for the base fuel with methanol
being supplied as and when needed in an engine more optimized
for efficiency would seem to be a pragmatic step (for example via
increased compression ratio, increased downsizing etc.). Generally
the implication is that for base fuels with higher octane then DI of
methanol would appear beneficial; whereas for lower octane main
fuels, introduction of the methanol at the PFI position would ap-
pear to be acceptable, but there are unknowns in terms of which is
the best position to introduce the octane booster insofar as an en-
gine employing PFI systems for both base fuel and octane booster
may enable the deletion of the DI system with minimal effect on
engine efficiency. This has obvious economic implications, and may
enable easiest compliance with future PM legislation. It is consid-
ered that work in this area would be beneficial. Returning to the
alcohol/water injection concept, the above observations made with
respect to the potential to simplify an engine to two PFI systems
(i.e. by eliminating a DI one) also apply.

While the discussion above focused on efficiency benefits, there
can also be changes concerning emissions. The OOD approach al-
lows more-optimized spark timing in a combustion system that is
knock-limited  on  gasoline,  so  while  CO  and  HC  will  not  change
too  much  one  can  expect  NO
X  to  increase.  However,  as  it  is  a
lambda = 1 technology, there is no reason why existing aftertreat-
ment  would  not  be  able  to  deal  with  that.  Concerning  particle
emissions, results from testing on an engine employing both a PFI
and a DI system, running one fueling system on gasoline and the
other on methanol or ethanol, showed up to 95% reduction in PN
emissions, with the highest reductions obtained when the alcohol
was  introduced  using  the  DI  system  [195]  (which  also  gave  the
highest efficiency benefits).

As a final note, although there are clear benefits to the OOD
concept, obviously there is a challenge in terms of customer accep-
tance of a two-tank solution. Cohn and Bromberg focus on heavy
duty and suggest this should not be too different from the current
use of a ureum solution for NO
X aftertreatment [190] . There have
also  been  demonstrations  with  on-board  separation  of  gasoline-
alcohol blends in a low octane main fuel and a high octane sec-
ondary fuel, that would enable a single fuel tank [196] .

5. Using methanol in compression ignition engines

As  evident  from  the  octane  numbers  stated  in  Section  2 ,
methanol is most easily used as a spark ignition engine fuel. The
markets for spark ignition engines are primarily automotive, mo-
torcycles and leisure, i.e. smaller engines. Most commercial appli-
cations use compression ignition (CI) engines. Consequently, there
is a strong interest in finding ways to use methanol for CI engines.
However, the high octane numbers indicate very low cetane num-
bers (CN). For methanol the number is so low that it cannot be
measured directly. Extrapolation of test data using additives gives
a CN of 3 for pure methanol and a CN of 2 for methanol with 10%
water [148] . The next section discusses various concepts enabling
the  use  of  methanol  in  CI  engines,  after  which  Section  5.2  dis-
cusses reported measurements using some of these concepts, and

73

Section 5.3 explains the current interest in the marine sector and
presents ongoing demonstrations.

5.1. CI concepts

Since CN is a measure of a fuel’s auto-ignitibility pure methanol
is unsuitable for use in conventional compression-ignition engines.
However, it can be used in conjunction with another fuel which
is more auto-ignitable, or with an ‘ignition improver’. In the 1980s
the Detroit Diesel Company (DDC) and MAN [197] produced modi-
fied versions of their compression-ignition engines which ran on
‘ignition  improved’  methanol  fuel  (the  ignition  improver  consti-
tuted about 5% by volume of the fuel). The MAN engine was a four-
stroke engine using spark-assisted ignition whilst the DDC engines
operated  on  the  two-stroke  cycle,  controlling  the  scavenge  ratio
to assist ignition [198,199] . These engines ran in service in heavy-
duty automotive applications [200] . More recently, VTT has tested
so-called MD95, a mix of 95% methanol and 5% ignition improver
[2] . This was done using a Scania ED95 engine, which is an engine
modified to enable compression ignition operation on a mix of 95%
ethanol and 5% ignition improver through the adoption of an in-
creased  compression  ratio  (28:1,  to  increase  end-of-compression
temperature for easier ignition of the low cetane fuel), and a suit-
able fuel injection system.

Most  concepts  however  involve  a  high  cetane  number  fuel
(mostly  diesel)  to  ensure  (auto-)ignition.  One  option  is  to  use  a
methanol-diesel mixture, injected instead of pure diesel. This has
the advantage that only one injector is needed and the engine con-
version is relatively straightforward. However, this requires emul-
sifier agents or co-solvents and even then the methanol fraction is
limited because diesel and alcohols do not mix well. Additionally,
higher  methanol  fractions  reduce  the  resulting  fuel’s  volumetric
energy content which means the rated power could potentially be
hard to maintain using the standard injectors. Finally, methanol’s
low lubricity compared to diesel might necessitate lubricating ad-
ditives. The ‘dual fuel’ approach is more common, where methanol
and diesel are introduced into the engine separately.

Again,  several  options  are  possible.  Methanol  can  be  injected
directly in the combustion chambers, similar to the diesel injec-
tion.  The  diesel  injection  then  serves  as  a  pilot  fuel  for  igniting
the  methanol.  The  advantage  is  that  when  the  methanol  injec-
tion is timed such that premixing with the compressed air is lim-
ited,  knock  (through  autoignition  of  end  gas)  is  not  a  concern.
The downside is that this approach requires either custom cylin-
der heads, with separate DI methanol injectors, or custom injec-
tors  that  are  able  to  introduce  both  methanol  and  diesel  to  the
cylinders. This concept is a commercial reality today, used by MAN
for low-speed two-stroke engines and Wärtsilä for medium-speed
four-stroke engines, as discussed further in Section 5.3 . In the case
of the Wärtsilä medium-speed engine, injectors are used with a
central  diesel  nozzle  and  3  methanol  nozzles  equally  positioned
around the diesel nozzle, within the same injector body. Methanol
is injected at 600 bar [201] . The MAN two-stroke engine uses sepa-
rate injectors for diesel and methanol, adding 2 methanol injectors
that inject methanol at around 500 bar [202] . In both engines, a
separate hydraulic oil circuit is used to actuate the methanol in-
jectors and high pressure methanol pumps are needed, which are
expensive due to methanol’s low lubricity and high corrosivity.

An easier solution, particularly when looking at retrofit options
(more easily introduced to the market, and a particular focus for
e.g. marine engines which typically have very long lifetimes), is in-
troducing methanol into the engine’s intake ports. This ‘only’ re-
quires  adding  a  low  pressure  methanol  fueling  system  and  port
fuel  injectors.  Disadvantages  are  comparable  to  natural  gas  dual
fuel conversions. First, the premixed methanol-air mixture that re-
sults from this can limit the attainable power output, due to end-

gas auto-ignition. This requires either lowering the compression ra-
tio,  or  limiting  the  methanol  fraction  used  at  higher  loads.  Sec-
ond, the methanol fraction at lower loads will also be limited to
maintain combustion stability, with the methanol-air mixture lean-
ing  out  at  lower  loads  and  approaching  flammability  limits.  Fi-
nally,  the  presence  of  fuel  throughout  the  combustion  chamber
can  cause  problems  with  engine  oil  life  (with  methanol  ending
up in the crankcase through blow-by) and emissions of unburned
fuel  can  be  an  issue,  especially  in  the  case  of  large  valve  over-
laps (this is an advantage of methanol versus natural gas, as the
methanol molecule has a significantly lower global warming po-
tential than methane [30] ). Timing the methanol injection to start
only after the exhaust valves have closed might compromise the
evaporation and again increases the amount of methanol ending
up in the lube oil. Reducing or eliminating the valve overlap means
new camshafts and a derating of the nominal engine power out-
put.  Nevertheless, due  to  its simplicity engine conversions using
this ‘fumigation’ concept have been reported most widely.

Another solution that has received little to no attention makes
use  of  the  relative  ease  of  fuel  reforming  of  methanol  (see
Section 6 ): glow plug ignition. This would enable a compression ig-
nition engine to run solely on methanol, without the requirement
of a pilot fuel to serve as the ignition source. Instead, a hot surface
(the glow plug) triggers surface ignition of methanol relatively eas-
ily, which is thought to be due to the dissocation of methanol into
carbon monoxide and hydrogen, with the latter easily pre-igniting
[203] . This is actually the working principle of model engines (al-
though these run on a mixture, typically about 70% of methanol
and up to 20% of oil as these are two-stroke crankcase-scavenged
engines, with various amounts of nitromethane to increase engine
power output by oxygen availability).

Finally,  very  recently  research  engines  have  been  run  on
methanol  in  homogeneous  charge  compression  ignition  (HCCI)
mode  and  partially  premixed  combustion  mode  (PPC)  [204,205] .
Both concepts rely on delaying the autoignition until after the fuel
injection event has been completed to allow for sufficient mixing
time so that fuel-rich zones are reduced or eliminated, to decrease
soot formation and speed up combustion for higher efficiency. The
high heat of vaporization and the high autoignition temperature of
methanol both lead to long ignition delays, making it quite easy to
get a long mixing time before autoignition. This has been shown to
result in the mixture being lean at autoignition, completely elimi-
nating any possibility for soot formation (see Section 2.2 ). Unfortu-
nately, the long ignition delays and essentially fully premixed au-
toignition limit the operating range due to excessive peak pressure
rise rates at high loads. In research engines, this challenge is cur-
rently alleviated by preheating of the intake air. A production en-
gine would probably require extensive engine modifications. Nev-
ertheless, initial results are promising, as detailed in the next sec-
tion.

5.2. CI engine results

5.2.1. Fumigation

Coulier  and  Verhelst  reviewed  the  literature  reporting  results
on diesel engines (both automotive and heavy duty size) converted
to dual fuel operation with methanol introduced in the engine in-
take [206] . For dual fuel engines, the maximum substitution ratio
is very important, i.e. the amount of diesel fuel that can be re-
placed by methanol. This ratio (or the methanol energy fraction)
was found to differ significantly between different engines, from
as low as 70% [207] to as high as 85% [208] . This is likely due to
differences in com pression ratio, turbochar ging pressures etc., af-
fecting end-gas temperature history and thus knock occurrence.

Concerning  brake  thermal  efficiency,  they  concluded  that  us-
ing the fumigation method a drop in efficiency sometimes occurs

74

across the load range which gets more pronounced as the substitu-
tion ratio is increased. In most cases however, a slight decrease in
efficiency is observed at low loads and a slight increase at high
loads.  In  general,  the  lower  efficiency  at  low  loads  could  be  at-
tributed to a lower combustion efficiency: the premixed methanol-
air mixture can approach the flammability limits leading to higher
emissions  of  unburned  fuel  (wide  open  throttle  operation  with
load  controlled  by  the  air/fuel  ratio).  At  higher  loads,  the  faster
and cooler combustion of methanol (closer to the thermodynam-
ically ideal isochoric combustion, and with lower heat losses) en-
ables higher efficiency compared to the slower diffusion combus-
tion on diesel.

In  most  cases  the  conversion  of  the  base  diesel  engine  to
dual  fuel  operation  with  methanol  is  targeted  at  decreasing  the
two main pollutants of concern for diesel engines: NO
X  and PM.
Reviewing  the  reported  results,  Coulier  and  Verhelst  concluded
that  dual  fuel  operation  indeed  leads  to  a  general  drop  in  NO
X
emissions  across  the  load  and  speed  range,  ranging  from  a  6%
[209] reduction to over 50% [210] depending on load and achiev-
able  methanol  fraction.  This  reduction  gets  more  pronounced  as
the substitution ratio is increased. The main reason for this is the
cooling  effect  of  the  methanol  that  is  injected  in  the  intake  of
the engine. It provides lower in-cylinder temperatures, greatly re-
ducing thermal NO formation. The faster premixed combustion of
methanol also shortens the combustion duration limiting the du-
ration of high in-cylinder temperatures. This means there is less
time for NO to be formed.

Noteworthy however, is the much increased ratio of NO

2 to NO
emissions with methanol. This is thought to be due to the forma-
2 radical during methanol combustion, which reacts
tion of the HO
→ NO
2 through NO + HO
with NO to NO
2 to NO
2
2
ratio has been found to increase sixfold for some cases, compared
to diesel operation [209] . However, the ratio was found to signif-
icantly decrease when using a diesel oxidation catalyst [211] . This
counter-intuitive result was explained by the reaction of NO
2 with
HC and CO back to NO.

+ OH. The NO

Soot emissions are also suppressed in dual fuel operation. This
is because part of the diesel consumption is replaced by methanol
which contains no aromatics, has no carbon-carbon bonds, and is
oxygenated. Methanol is also a simple molecule with a low molec-
ular  weight.  In  addition,  the  methanol  is  premixed  with  air  so
there  is  a  very  low  tendency  to  form  locally  rich  zones.  More-
over,  because  of  the  high  heat  of  vaporization  of  methanol,  the
ignition delay is usually increased giving the diesel more time to
evaporate and mix with air. Consequently, fewer locally rich zones
of diesel are formed (less diffusion burning), lowering soot emis-
sions by  up to  80% [210] .  The OH radicals that  are formed dur-
ing  the  oxidation  of  methanol  also  aid  in  oxidizing  soot  precur-
sors. Yin et al. [212] studied the combustion characteristics of a
diesel spray injected into a methanol-air atmosphere, such as in a
dual fuel engine, in a constant volume combustion chamber. They
looked specifically into changes of ignition delay and flame lift-off
length between injection into a methanol-air atmosphere and in-
jection into an air atmosphere. The ignition delay increased for the
methanol-air case, which would lead to more mixing prior to the
start of combustion and thus lower soot emissions. The flame lift-
off length  is  related  to  the  ignition  delay,  and  increased  for  the
methanol case, which would enhance the oxygen uptake into the
jet again lowering soot emissions. However, as they increased the
initial temperature, the differences in ignition delay and flame lift-
off length to those obtained in the air case almost disappeared.

The soluble organic fraction of the particulate matter emissions
is generally increased. This relates to the increase of unburnt hy-
drocarbon emissions that is usually encountered with dual fuel op-
eration (see below). Overall, the particulate mass emissions gener-
ally decreased. However, the authors found no agreement in liter-

ature on the particulate number concentration. Regarding the par-
ticle size distribution, a shift towards smaller particles is often ob-
served because of nucleation and condensation of unburnt hydro-
carbons leading to a smaller mean geometric diameter.

As is clear from the above the typical trade-off between NO
X
and PM emissions observed in pure diesel operation disappears in
dual fuel mode. In other words, methanol fumigation allows one to
X and PM emissions. Unfortunately,
simultaneously reduce both NO
the  downside  is  an  increase  in  CO  and  HC  emissions.  CO  emis-
sions are higher in dual fuel mode than in pure diesel operation
and increase with increasing methanol fraction. This is due to the
lower temperatures associated with the higher heat of vaporization
of methanol. The lower temperature impedes the full oxidation of
the fuel. This increase is most pronounced at low loads. Unburnt
hydrocarbon emissions are also higher in dual fuel mode, for the
same reasons, besides HC emissions originating from crevices since
methanol is premixed with the air.

Very few data can be found on formaldehyde emissions in dual
fuel operation. Cheung et al. [209] measured formaldehyde emis-
sions for dual fuel operation with low methanol substitution ra-
tios (up to 30% on an energy basis) and found them to increase
with  load  and  methanol  fraction,  up  to  3.3  times  higher  than
for  pure  diesel  operation.  They  explain  the  increased  emissions
by  the  lower  combustion  temperature,  although  this  contradicts
the increase with load. However, this could be due to the emis-
sions being reported in ppm instead of on a brake specific basis
(g/kWh).  Testing  with  a  diesel  oxidation  catalyst  showed  reduc-
tions of formaldehyde emissions with more than 90%. Similar re-
ductions were found by Wei et al. [211] , who ran tests with higher
methanol substitution ratios (up to 70%). However, the engine-out
emissions of formaldehyde were found to be up to a factor of 150
higher  than  for  diesel  operation,  and  the  oxidation  catalyst  was
less effective at low loads. The authors concluded that emissions of
formaldehyde, CO and HC could be a limiting factor for the achiev-
able methanol fraction at low loads.

Note that the overall level of emissions of the methanol dual
fuel  mode,  compared  to  the  base  diesel  operation,  will  depend
strongly  on  the  operational  profile  of  the  engine:  the  methanol
fraction is typically zero at idling and at full load, for reasons ex-
plained above, and varies in between.

5.2.2. Other

As mentioned above, numerous concepts have been advanced
for using methanol in compression ignition engines. Compared to
the  fumigation  concept  however,  these  concepts  are  more  com-
plicated and few results have been reported, in some cases lim-
ited  to  a  single  paper  for  a  particular  concept.  As  described  in
Section  5.1 ,  initial  attempts  date  back  to  the  1980s.  Hikino  and
Suzuki [213] reported testing on an engine with increased com-
pression ratio (27:1), using an external uncooled EGR system and
insulated piston, all with the intention of raising in-cylinder tem-
peratures for easier autoignition of methanol. The EGR system was
added to ensure that temperatures remained sufficiently high even
at part load. The aim of the work was to increase part load effi-
ciency compared with a heavy-duty spark ignition engine. Enabling
autoignition with the measures listed above greatly improved effi-
ciency, getting close to the efficiency of a comparable diesel en-
gine,  with  lowered  NO
X  emission  as  well.  However,  it  compro-
mised peak power output and lowered peak load efficiency.

Interestingly, the heat release plots shown by the authors indi-
cate that although the main features of a diesel-like combustion
are present, it is clear that the premixed autoignition part is much
more  important  than  the  diffusion  combustion  part.  This  corre-
sponds with the findings of CFD simulations of late injection oper-
ating points of a PPC type concept [214] , which show that the au-
toignition is actually only happening when the mixture is already

75

lean of stoichiometric, a feature caused by the high heat of vapor-
ization, high RON and low AFR of methanol; this causes most of
the heat to be released in an “HCCI type combustion”.

In  1990,  Caterpillar  reported  results  from  an  extensive  mea-
surement campaign with long haul trucks using methanol engines
[215] .  These  were  modified  diesel  engines,  using  glow  plugs  for
cold start and assisting ignition. Power output and efficiency was
on par with the diesel version, while combustion was essentially
smoke-free.  The  accumulated  mileage (60 0.0 0 0  km)  allowed  en-
gine  durability  to  be  assessed.  Cylinder  liner  wear  appeared  to
be  reduced  compared  to  the  diesel  version,  whereas  valve  faces
showed increased wear. This was attributed to the soot-free com-
bustion (the soot helps in lubricating the valves) and easily solved
with modified valve material. However, injector and glow plug life-
times were limited.

More recently, Roberts et al. [216] investigated the requirements
for reliable compression ignition operation on methanol. They pro-
posed a temperature at start of injection requirement of 1100 K,
which they calculated to be achievable by turbocharging, using low
heat  rejection  cylinder  surfaces  and  possibly  by  deleting  the  in-
tercooler. Spray visualization in a free piston test rig and testing
in  a  single  cylinder  research  engine  led  to  some  interesting  re-
sults.  Although  engine-out  soot  mass  emissions  were  effectively
zero  on  methanol,  the  spray  imaging  did  show  soot  formation.
Thus,  the  formation  seemed  to  be  balanced  by  subsequent  oxi-
dation. Even more interesting was that methanol combustion was
soot-free  even  at  stoichiometric  conditions  (likely  caused  by  the
fuel-bound  oxygen  [217] ).  This  opens  the  possibility  of  using  a
three-way catalyst for NO
X  control, which is much cheaper than
lean NO
X aftertreatment systems such as selective catalytic reduc-
tion. The stoichiometric operation led to a drop in combustion ef-
ficiency, to 96%, but if combined with waste heat recovery (which
would harvest some of the thermal energy liberated by oxidation
of this unburned fuel in the aftertreatment) a brake thermal ef-
ficiency of 51% should be feasible according to modelling work by
the authors. Stoichiometric combustion would also increase the en-
gine’s power density, an advantage over low temperature combus-
tion concepts such as are described next (although mode-switching
to  such  concepts  might  be  necessary  to  cope  with  the  lowest
loads).

Shamun  et  al.  were  the  first  to  report  a  series  of  tests  on
methanol PPC combustion [204,205,218] . All work was done on a
heavy duty Scania D13 engine converted to single cylinder opera-
tion, using three different compression ratios. A small amount of
lubricant (200 ppm of Infineum R566) was added to the methanol
fuel, to prevent wear in the high pressure injection system by in-
creasing  the  viscosity  (with  injection  pressures  up  to  1600  bar).
With the 27:1 compression ratio, results were obtained both with
conventional  diesel-like  combustion  and  with  partially  premixed
combustion  [205] .  Peak  gross  indicated  efficiency  reached  52.8%
at the 6 bar gross IMEP and 1200 rpm testing point. Engine-out
NO
X  could be brought below EURO VI levels by using EGR. Rela-
tively high hydrocarbon emissions were recorded (of the order of 2
g/kWh), which the authors attributed to the high compression ra-
tio (with some of the fuel ending up in the squish regions). These
HC emissions could be lowered somewhat by lowering the injec-
tion pressure (from 1600 to 800 bar), which did not affect any of
the  other  measured  parameters  such  as  NO
X  and  efficiency.  The
authors also reported that the very high compression ratio limited
the load range, primarily because of peak pressure limitations.

In  subsequent  work  [204] ,  a  compression  ratio  of  15:1  was
used, similar to PPC work on other fuels in that research group.
This  compression  ratio  would  alleviate  peak  pressure  limitations
but  likely  lead  to  cold  start  problems.  The  focus  of  that  paper
was on particle emissions. Ethanol and naphtha gasoline were in-
cluded in the measurement campaign and so was PPC as well as

diffusion combustion of methanol. Methanol PPC operation halved
the particle count compared to diffusion combustion. For the al-
X -soot  trade-off was  present.  Some  of  the  particle
cohols,  no  NO
count and sizing results were puzzling and hence the authors stud-
ied  this  with  additional  measurement  techniques  in  a  follow-up
paper [218] . The compression ratio now was the stock 17.3:1, and
measurement equipment now included an electrostatic precipita-
tor, transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy,  in  addition  to  the  micro  soot  sensor  and  particle
number concentration and size distribution measurement used in
the previous work. Ultrafine particles were found (mostly below
23 nm), with a hollow or liquid core that upon analysis of their
composition proved to originate from the lubrication oil. The au-
thors  suggested  that  such  particles  are  probably  always  present
but  usually  collect  onto  diesel  soot  particles.  Due  to  the  essen-
tially soot-free combustion of alcohols (methanol and ethanol were
tested), these particles have nothing to agglomerate with and are
detected as formed, i.e. as nucleation particles.

Finally, VTT reported work using MD95 in a Scania ED95 en-
gine  [219] ,  i.e.  running  a  mixture  of  methanol  and  ignition  im-
prover in a compression ignition cycle. A number of different ad-
ditives (ignition enhancer) were tested, with the aim of bringing
the cetane number up to a minimum of 11. The best results were
obtained with the same additive as used in ED95. Engine testing
with MD95 showed CO and NO
X levels to be below those on ED95
and formaldehyde emissions to be lower than those on diesel. Par-
ticle mass was comparable to diesel operation although the filter
paper was completely white on MD95, possibly indicating the PM
to consist of semivolatiles or unburned additive. Particle number
count was above the Euro VI limit but given the particle nature,
the authors suspected this might easily be removable using an ox-
idation catalyst (standard equipment on the commercially available
Scania ED95 engines).

From the work reported above, it is clear that interesting results
have been found, with high efficiencies and/or very low emissions,
but most results are for isolated operating conditions or have not
been confirmed yet by other researchers. These are certainly con-
cepts requiring further research.

5.3. Methanol as a fuel for shipping

There  is  currently  a  growing  interest  in  methanol  as  an  al-
ternative  fuel,  in  the  marine  sector.  The  main  reason  for  this  is
tightening emissions legislation. For ocean-going vessels, the Inter-
national Maritime Organization (IMO) has introduced Tier 3 NO
X
emission regulations, applicable in the so-called Emission Control
Areas (ECAs), e.g. densely populated coastal areas. The allowable
sulphur content of marine fuels is also coming down. This has led
to a number of technologies being introduced to meet the more
stringent regulations. Next to technologies that allow the contin-
ued use of heavy fuel oils (HFO) such as aftertreatment systems,
alternative fuels are also gaining traction. Initially, the focus was
mostly on liquified natural gas (LNG). However, making provisions
for a liquified gas storage system has substantial effects on ship
design  or  retrofits.  For  many  applications,  methanol  is  an  easier
fuel to handle as it is liquid at atmospheric conditions. It can also
be made from the natural gas. A recent technical report from the
EU’s Joint Research Centre concluded that LNG and methanol seem
to be the most promising alternative fuels for shipping at the mo-
ment [220] . This is partly based on methanol’s availability in most
large ports.

Methanol’s  suitability  as  a  marine  fuel  is  linked  to  its  safety
characteristics, excellent emissions compared to the bunker fuel or
heavy fuel oils that large ships currently generally use and the fact
that it is infinitely miscible in water, meaning that the double hulls
of existing vessels can be modified to suit its storage. Double hulls

76

S. Verhelst et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 70 (2019) 43–88

are a necessity for ships carrying hydrocarbons since these fuels
will not mix with water; the infinite miscibility of methanol in-
stead means that these voids can be used to store the alcohol be-
cause with a tank breach the fuel will just dissolve. A study con-
ducted by Malcolm Pirnie inc. [221] found that in case there would
be a methanol spill, it dilutes so rapidly that dangerous concen-
trations are never reached. Next to the miscibility which leads to
a more rapid dilution, this is also caused by lethal concentrations
(for marine life) being 240 times higher for methanol compared
to diesel, and 1900 times higher than for gasoline. Thus, it is very
unlikely that such concentrations are ever reached.

A  number  of  demonstration  projects  have  been  looking  into
methanol use for shipping. The most notable ones are the Stena
Germanica 1500 passenger ferry conversion [222] and the Water-
front Shipping 50.0 0 0 deadweight tonnage methanol tanker ves-
sels [223] , both demonstrating vessels operating on methanol. In
the case of the Stena Germanica, medium-speed four-stroke ma-
rine  diesel  engines  were  upgraded  by  Wärtsilä with  proprietary
injectors allowing the (separate) direct injection of methanol and
pilot fuel (marine gasoil, MGO). The Waterfront Shipping tankers
run with MAN low-speed two-stroke engines, again using separate
direct  injection  of  methanol  and  pilot  fuel  (MGO  or  HFO).  Mea-
surement data from these engines are limited to the few results
presented by the manufacturers, showing compliance with emis-
sion regulations and reporting efficiencies to be in line with the
efficiency on diesel fuel.

Generally these large marine engines are dual fuel diesel en-
gines, directly comparable to liquified natural gas (LNG) dual fuel
marine engines. Such engines have been developed for example for
LNG tankers. However, methanol is much safer in use than LNG be-
cause it is a liquid, and although the (net) volumetric LHV is ap-
proximately 23% lower (15.9 vs. 20.5 MJ/l) methanol is more eas-
ily stored aboard a vessel without the attendant storage compli-
cations arising from cryogenic storage of a gas. A very important
safety consideration is that the flash point of methanol is much
lower than that of LNG; the flammability index of methanol is in
fact much closer to that of diesel, and in the instance of a pool fire
methanol is vastly more safe than either gases or liquid hydrocar-
bons [53,54] .

An increasing number of other demonstration projects are be-
ing concluded or launched (e.g. LeanShips [224] , MethaShip, SUM-
METH [225] and GreenPilot [226] ), focusing on various aspects of
using methanol as an alternative fuel, e.g. bunkering, high speed
marine engines, safety, life cycle costs and environmental impacts.
Recent reports covering the use of methanol for marine application
contain more information [227–229] .

6. Fuel reforming using engine waste heat

As discussed in Section 1.4 , methanol is a very interesting hy-
drogen carrier and has therefore also been investigated as an en-
ergy vector for powering fuel cell vehicles. The methanol would
then be used as fuel, for its convenience (being a liquid), and be
reformed on-board to generate hydrogen, or be used directly in a
direct-methanol fuel cell (DMFC) [230] . Fuel reforming in ICEs has
been reviewed extensively recently [231] . The fact that methanol
reforms at a temperature that is low enough to make significant
use of low-grade exhaust heat even at low loads makes it excep-
tionally attractive in terms of waste heat recovery on internal com-
bustion engines. This thermochemical recuperation approach can
be implemented via two different reaction pathways, as discussed
by Poran and Tartakovsky [232] :
CH 3 OH → CO + 2 H 2

(13)

CH 3 OH + H 2 O → CO 2 + 3 H 2

(14)

The  first  pathway  is  thermal  decomposition  and  the  second  is
steam reforming, for which one mole of water has to be provided
for each mole of methanol (representing a volume percentage of
30.75% water in methanol). Both reactions are endothermic, so for
thermochemical recuperation to work, energy is absorbed by the
liquid(s) from the waste heat stream. This results in a higher LHV
of the resulting gaseous fuel, yielding an overall improvement in
system  efficiency  when  the  gaseous  fuel  is  used  in  the  engine.
With reaction 13 , the LHV of the products is about 20% higher than
of the reactant. With reaction 14 , this ratio is 13% [233] .

There is a similar reaction for ethanol, which reforms at very
similar temperatures, the decomposition reaction being similar to
that for methanol in Eq. 13 in that one mole of ethanol produces
three moles of gases [232,234] :

C 2 H 5 OH → H 2 + CO + CH 4

This will be returned to later.

(15)

In  addition  to  cyclic  combustion  engines,  the  concept  of
methanol  reforming  has  been  proposed  and  discussed  for  many
other  different  types  of  prime  mover.  Carapellucci  and  Milazzo
[235] discuss an application for power generation in a gas turbine
where steam-reformed reformate is separated prior to combustion
so that the CO
2 can be sequestrated while the hydrogen passes into
the combustion chamber, and Cocco and Tola discuss its use in a
solid oxide fuel cell plant [236] . In both, the recuperation approach
leads to significant gains in efficiency, with Carapellucci and Mi-
lazzo showing approximately 20% relative improvement due to the
thermal energy recovery and Cocco and Tola an increase from 64%
to 68% in overall SOFC-gas turbine plant efficiency.

Historically,  light-duty  engine  operation  using  decomposed
or  steam-reformed  methanol  has  been  discussed  by  many  re-
searchers. Kowalewicz [237] proposed the use of methanol decom-
position as a part-load strategy, stating that the improvement in
lower heating value of the mixture was of the order of 20% (from
20.0 to 23.9 MJ/kg). His approach would require two fuel systems
on the engine, albeit both drawing from only one fuel tank, see
Fig. 24 a.

In the first fuel system, for operation at light load, the methanol
is taken from the tank to a reformer where exhaust heat causes
its decomposition to hydrogen and carbon monoxide, after which
the  gases  are  stored  in  a  buffer  tank.  They  are  then  introduced
into the intake manifold where two effects raise the part-load ef-
ficiency of the engine: one due to the increase in LHV, and the
other to air being displaced by the much less dense gases provid-
ing a significant dethrottling effect, which is very important in 4-
stroke engines. In the second fuel system, there is a switch back to
liquid methanol for operation at full load, ensuring that maximum
power can still be met. Prior to Kowalewicz, McCall and co-workers
[238] presented test results using simulated mixtures of gases for
both dissociated and steam reformed cases; they showed relative
improvements of the order of 30% at light load, showing that there
is clearly an effect beyond the increase in LHV. In the 1980s Volk-
swagen AG also heavily investigated methanol as a transport fuel
as part of a German government initiative [239] , and within this
König et al. [240] reported results for dissociated gases using a re-
former in the exhaust gas stream in which a copper catalyst was
used. They report efficiency improvements for partially dissociated
methanol of 10% over pure methanol, with improved exhaust emis-
sions including an 80% reduction in aldehyde emissions to below
those from gasoline, and included road load data.

One of the attractions of the approach is that, in an analogue of
the methanol synthesis reaction, in theory a relatively cheap cata-
lyst material can be used; König et al. [240] report tests of thirty
different types of catalyst material, with copper being very advan-
tageous, but they state that at that time for reasons of longevity a
noble metal catalyst may have been needed.

tles the engine in the part load regime; as the load increases re-
tarding injection into the compression stroke allows more air in
and  thus  gives  a  window  of  load  control.  The  ability  to  operate
extremely lean (due to the wide flammability range of hydrogen)
means that load control is a mixture of quality and quantity con-
trol depending on the operating strategy [232] . They also suggest
that,  if  the  reforming  reactions  are  complete  and  therefore  (be-
cause of the high hydrogen content) extremely lean operation is
possible,  so  making  NO
X  production  minimal,  then  operation  of
an engine by qualitative load control could be afforded. Since no
hydrocarbon emissions would result from fuel combustion then in
this case the catalyst in the exhaust might be deleted and on a sys-
tem level effectively replaced by the one in the reformer. No par-
ticulates would be formed due to the fuel molecules being gases
not containing carbon-carbon bonds, meaning no particulate trap
would be required. This overall strategy is considered an intriguing
possibility. Note that Bromberg and Cohn proposed the reforma-
tion at high pressure as part of a Rankine cycle with methanol or
hydrous alcohols as working fluid [243] .

The above concepts have been directed at pure methanol as the
fuel  in  the  tank.  As  discussed  in  Section  1.6.1 ,  methanol  can  be
blended with other fuels, and this is sometimes advantageous in
terms of cold starting, visible flame, providing an unpalatable taste
to prevent ingestion etc. Therefore M85 is commonly used, but the
gasoline component, essentially being a mixture of pure hydrocar-
bons, will not reform at temperatures that are easily reached dur-
ing part load operation (i.e. 600 °C). However, it may still be possi-
ble to reform the methanol part of the blend, as work led by Mon-
santo has shown for ethanol reforming, where the ethanol in E85
has successfully been dissociated in a prototype reformer leading
to significant efficiency benefits: Fowler et al. [244] report 10–12%
over E85 operation; Wheeler et al. [245] measured 8.5–12.7% rel-
ative to E85 and 18–19.8% relative to 98 RON. This is because of
dethrottling as well as other effects. These researchers used a cop-
per catalyst, linking back to the work conducted by König and co-
workers, and in the work by Fowler et al. it is stated that ‘Simi-
lar benefits and operability would be expected on high methanol
blends such as those currently in use in China, since the catalyst is
known to be active for methanol reforming in the same tempera-
ture range’ [244] . If this is the case, it is possible that GEM blends
as discussed in Section 1.6.2 could also be used in such reformer
strategies.

Note  that  actual  efficiency  improvements  from  methanol  re-
forming using waste heat are still uncertain. The LHV of the re-
formed stream might increase, but there are competing effects –
primarily a molar expansion ratio decrease. As Table 3 shows, the
mole  ratio  of  products  to  reactants  is  much  lower  for  hydrogen
compared to methanol. The same is true for CO. As hydrogen and
CO are the two main products of fuel reforming, the work potential
of the reformed fuel significantly decreases [77] . This needs further
investigation. Nevertheless, there are other potential advantages of
reforming. As already partly explained above, it could lower pol-
lutant emissions. Additionally, one of the advantages of reforming
is that, if gaseous reformate is buffered in a storage tank, it can
be  used  to  overcome  the  cold-start  issue  of  light  alcohols  since
there are no longer the latent heat and vapour pressure issues for
molecular alcohol combustion arising from the hydrogen bonding
of the alcohol molecules. In the work of Fowler et al. [244] , for
E85 reforming fueling a 3.5 liter engine, the authors used a 4 liter
buffer tank which they sized to enable 50% use during the first half
minute after cold start while allowing it to be packaged in a vehi-
cle. The wide lean limit of hydrogen means that NO
X  emissions
could be kept low (perhaps with additional application of cooled
EGR) and because of the fact that the only carbon entering the en-
2 then hydrocarbon emissions
gine is in the form of either CO or CO
from the fuel would be impossible (in the case of 100% efficient

Fig. 24.  Reforming concepts.

Turner proposed reforming directly in an EGR stream as part of
a cooled scheme [241] , see Fig. 24 b; this would in theory mean
a much cheaper reformer geometry could be used. He suggested
that  the  latent  heat  of  the  methanol  could  be  used  to  partially
cool the EGR gas, leading to an advantage for that system, and also
proposed novel operating strategies with different injection noz-
zle and catalytic surface positions either to provide recuperation
or not as the engine load changed. Part of the reason for the strat-
egy proposed by Turner is that there are synergies between using
hydrogen-rich reformate and cooled EGR in an engine: both will
dethrottle the engine, but the very fast LBV of hydrogen helps to
extend the EGR limit in turn permitting more to be used. In the
invention, moving gradually from reforming to non-reformed liq-
uid methanol provides a measure of mixture quantity load control
across the engine operating map.

Poran  and  Tartakovsky  have  proposed  high  pressure  thermo-
chemical recuperation by steam reforming so that only gases are
ever delivered to the combustion chamber [232,242] . Their work,
which includes a comprehensive literature review of thermochem-
ical recuperation, is novel because it proposes the use of only one
injection system so that maximum power can be maintained via
closed-valve injection of  the  reformate.  Firstly methanol is  pres-
surized up to the direct-injection delivery pressure and is then re-
formed at that pressure, see Fig. 24 c; this removes the challenge of
and energy input to compressing the eventual gaseous fuel to that
pressure. Because of the direct injection strategy in their 4-stroke
engine, injecting during the intake stroke displaces air and dethrot-

reforming and assuming no oil carryover). Aldehyde emissions, a
challenge for molecular alcohol combustion, would be eradicated.
For the dissociation case, very lean operation would be expected to
fully oxidize CO to CO
2 , and for obvious reasons particulate matter
would be expected to be absent (again, leaving aside any lubricant
effect).

Thus emissions from such a concept would be expected to be
very low where no gasoline is in the liquid fuel in the tank, and
all authors who have investigated reforming of alcohols report im-
provements in emissions over the liquid-fuelled case. However, for
systems where liquid alcohol is introduced for full-load operation,
it would be necessary to transition from lean gaseous combustion
through to stoichiometric (and then possibly rich) liquid fuel op-
eration,  meaning  that  a  lean-NO
X  trap  (LNT)  may  be  necessary
as  part  of  the  exhaust  aftertreatment  system.  This  may  also  be
the case for systems where there is some gasoline blended into
the alcohol. Wheeler and co-workers reported use of a LNT and
strategies  to  regenerate  it,  including  injection  of  reformate  after
the three-way catalyst and before the LNT, which is an interesting
strategy possibly eliminating the need to operate the engine com-
bustion system stoichiometrically. Also against this background the
high-pressure reforming approach of Poran and co-workers would
seem to be very attractive, providing the ultra-lean operation elim-
inates the need for NO
X  after treatment, and the switch to stoi-
chiometric/rich operation at full load can be made rapidly enough.
Finally,  on-board  reforming  of  methanol  has  also  been  pro-
posed  for  RCCI  concepts  (reactivity  controlled  compression  igni-
tion). This would enable storing a single fuel, but through reform-
ing  obtaining  two  fuels  of  different  reactivity  [246] .  These  fuels
could be dimethylether (DME), a high cetane fuel, and methanol
or methanol reformer gas, high octane fuels.

7. Simulation studies

Obviously, with ever increasing complexity of engine technol-
ogy and degrees of freedom, and ever tightening demands on en-
gine efficiency and emission levels, there is an increasing need for
simulation tools in engine research and development. In the fol-
lowing sections, we review the state-of-the-art for methanol en-
gine combustion computation.

7.1. Quasi-dimensional models

Engine  simulation  based  on  quasi-dimensional  modelling  can
be a useful tool for exploration of the potential of alcohol fuels and
their  impact  on  engine  control  strategies.  The  quasi-dimensional
approach, or ‘multizone thermodynamic’, is suitable where a com-
promise is sought between accuracy and speed of calculation [92] .
The following sections review: the work done in modelling normal
flame propagation for pure methanol; normal combustion for al-
cohol blends; abnormal combustion, again for pure methanol and
then for blends; in-cylinder heat transfer; and finally methanol fuel
reforming.

7.1.1. Modelling regular combustion of pure methanol

Brown et al. used an entrainment combustion model to com-
pare  the  combustion  of  iso-octane  and  methanol  in  a  single-
cylinder research engine [247] . The turbulent burning velocity was
l + u (cid:6) , where u (cid:6) was
calculated using the Damköhler model: u t = u
estimated using an empirical expression from Mohanan and Babu
[248] . The laminar burning velocity of methanol was calculated us-
ing a correlation by Gibbs and Calcote [249] , combined with the
temperature and pressure trends predicted by Metghalchi and Keck
[250]  and a  factor representing the effect of  residual gas devel-
oped for gasoline combustion. The authors reported that the use of
methanol resulted in faster combustion. They note that a correct

calculation of the evaporation cooling by methanol is needed to
predict the volumetric efficiency. Also, the employed laminar burn-
ing velocity correlation resulted in poor results for rich mixtures.

Pourkhesalian et al. [251] compared the performance and emis-
sions of six different fuels, including methanol and ethanol, in a
PFI engine using a quasi-dimensional code with the turbulent com-
bustion model of Damköhler and a simple turbulence model com-
parable  to  that  of  Mohanan  and  Babu  [248] .  The  laminar  burn-
ing  velocity  of  methanol  was  calculated  using  the  correlation  of
Metghalchi and Keck [250] , that of ethanol by the correlation of
Liao et al. [252] . Methanol and ethanol were reported to produce
the lowest CO and NO
X  emissions. The predicted peak power on
methanol was lower than on gasoline, possibly because the cool-
ing effect of methanol was underestimated.

Boretti [114] investigated the potential for efficiency improve-
ment  in  a  dedicated  neat  ethanol  engine  using  the  entrainment
combustion model and k- (cid:9) turbulence model. A laminar burning
velocity correlation for gasoline was used, but the calibration con-
stants in the turbulent combustion model were adapted to account
for the higher u
l between gaso-
l of ethanol, based on the ratio of u
line and ethanol at stoichiometry and atmospheric conditions. The
author reported a potential BTE of 40% and BMEP levels of 30 bar
in a highly boosted, directly injected engine with an elevated com-
pression ratio (13:1) and fully variable valve actuation.

Vancoillie et al. [172] investigated quasi-dimensional modelling
of engines running on neat ethanol and methanol. A literature re-
view revealed that existing engine codes for alcohol-fueled engines
generally employ submodels developed for conventional hydrocar-
bon fuels. Significant differences, however, can be expected in the
mechanisms  of  combustion,  emission  formation  and  knock.  The
goal of their work was therefore to develop a simulation code valid
for neat methanol and ethanol-fueled engines.

An analytical study of the flame structure showed that flamelet
type combustion prevails inside these engines. This means the pri-
mary influence of turbulence is limited to stretching and wrinkling
of the flame front and the effects of combustion chemistry can be
grouped in the laminar burning velocity. Obtaining reliable data for
this crucial property at engine-like conditions (p, T and mixture
composition) formed a first major objective of the research.

From a survey of published literature, a lack of laminar burn-
ing  velocity  data  at  engine-like  conditions  became  apparent  for
ethanol and methanol in particular. Additionally, many published
values do not correctly account for flame stretch and instability.
For this reason, a library of flame data was generated using se-
lected chemical kinetics mechanisms. The resulting datasets were
used to fit new laminar burning velocity and flame thickness cor-
relations for the two fuels (see Section 2.3 ).

Moving  on  to  turbulent  burning  velocity,  a  literature  review
showed that this quantity is significantly affected by stretch and
instabilities  in  the  underlying  laminar  structure.  However,  the
molecular transport properties of light alcohols are such that these
effects are less pronounced than for some other fuels (e.g. gasoline,
hydrogen). A number of published turbulent combustion models
were  evaluated  based  on  measurements  of  methanol’s  turbulent
burning velocity obtained in a constant volume bomb [104] and
an existing dataset for ethanol. It appeared that models account-
ing for stretch and instability effects had a slight edge on simpler
formulations.

Finally, the developed submodels and correlations were imple-
mented  in  a  quasi-dimensional  engine  simulation  code.  An  in-
house code was integrated with the commercial engine simulation
tool GT-Power, thereby extending its functionality, for example by
enabling prediction of the gas dynamics during the breathing cycle,
pollutant formation and in-cylinder turbulence. To accurately pre-
dict the volumetric efficiency of port-fuel injected alcohol engines,

79

it proved necessary to include the dynamics of fuel puddling in the
gas dynamics model (further detailed below).

The  combustion  routines  were  validated  against  a  database
of  cylinder  pressure  traces  obtained  on  a  CFR  engine  for  both
methanol  and  ethanol  operation  and  varying  compression  ratio,
throttle  position,  ignition  timing  and  equivalence ratio.  The  new
laminar burning velocity correlations were shown to predict the
effects  of  varying  mixture  composition  much  better  than  exist-
ing  correlations.  A  comparison  confirmed  that  turbulent  burn-
ing velocity models including thermodiffusive properties (e.g. Zi-
mont, Bradley KaLe [253,254] performed better than simpler mod-
els  (Damkohler  [255] ).  Validation  on  a  second  engine  confirmed
these findings. Additionally, it was found that the effect of engine
rpm was best predicted by the Damkohler model, but this could
be due to uncertainties regarding the turbulence levels inside this
engine.

7.1.2. Modelling regular combustion of alcohol blends

In  the  early  1990’s  Mohanan  and  Babu  simulated  the  per-
formance  and  emissions  of  different  engine  configurations  fu-
eled with gasoline-methanol blends [248] using a two-zone quasi-
dimensional model. The turbulent burning velocity was calculated
based  on  an  empirical  expression  obtained  using  a  CFR  engine:
l + 4 u (cid:6) ,  where  the  rms  turbulent  velocity  u (cid:6)  was  assumed
u t = u
to decay continuously during combustion and considered to scale
linearly with engine speed. The authors report a lack of data for
the laminar burning velocity of methanol and calculated this quan-
tity using chemical kinetics results of Westbrook [256] . NO
X  lev-
els were calculated using the Woschni heat transfer model and the
extended Zel’dovich mechanism. The model was successfully vali-
dated for three operating points of different char ge pressure and
equivalence ratio.

Bougrine et al. [113] used their reduced Coherent Flame Model
to predict the performance, emissions and knock occurrence in a
directly injected single cylinder engine fueled with stoichiometric
gasoline-ethanol blends up to 30 vol% ethanol. They used Gülder’s
laminar burning velocity correlation [257] , but mentioned the lack
of a correct expression for the pressure sensitivity of u
l for these
blends. The influence of residual gases was implemented using an
expression developed for gasoline. Knock was predicted using the
model of Douad and Eyzat developed for primary reference fuels
[112] . The authors reported that indicated mean effective pressure
(IMEP) was predicted within 1bar for 70% of the operating points,
knock-limited spark advance was predicted within 2 degrees crank
angle and good trends were obtained for NO
X and CO, with some
error due to the uncertainty in residual gas content.

Sileghem et al. [32,258] investigated the modeling of the com-
bustion of alcohol-gasoline blends in a quasi-dimensional engine
model, focusing on improving the accuracy of the laminar burn-
ing velocity of alcohol-gasoline blends by using ‘mixing rules’ (see
Section 2.8.7 ). The predictive capabilities of the simulation model
were first tested for measurements on a CFR engine. Measurements
were performed on methanol-gasoline blends for a fixed ignition
timing,  fixed  throttle  position  and  fixed  engine  speed.  The  pre-
dictive performance of newly developed laminar burning velocity
correlations of gasoline and methanol together with a mixing rule
was assessed. The sensitivity was investigated for fuel blends go-
ing from pure gasoline to pure methanol. The results showed the
importance of the laminar burning velocity correlation, the initial
flame kernel creation and the estimation of the residual gas frac-
tion. The experimental trends of combustion properties such as ig-
nition delay, 10-90% mass fraction burned, 0-CA50 and maximum
pressure could not be reproduced in the simulations for lean and
stoichiometric mixtures while the agreement was better for rich
mixtures.  Uncertainty  about  the  initial  flame  kernel  size,  uncer-
tainty about the laminar burning velocity at higher pressure and

temperatures or the inability of the turbulent combustion model
to adequately capture the chemical effects were claimed as possi-
ble reasons. After changing some parameters of the laminar burn-
ing velocity correlation of methanol, the experimental trend could
be  reproduced.  Further  study  of  the  laminar  burning  velocity  at
higher temperatures and pressures is thus needed to lower the un-
certainty on this parameter. Because the initial flame kernel size
had a big influence on the ignition delay, it was decided to adjust
this initial flame kernel creation depending on the operating point.
After optimizing the initial flame kernel creation to reproduce the
same ignition delay as in the measurements, the trends in burn
rate and peak pressures were reproduced much better. The authors
stressed that a flame kernel (growth) model that properly accounts
for fuel effects could be very effective to improve the simulation
results.

Next to the measurements on a CFR engine, measurements on
a  direct  injected  2.4L  Hyundai  engine  were  also  used  to  evalu-
ate the simulation model. A broader measurement range than on
the CFR engine was used to get a more general view of the sim-
ulation output. First, simulations were again performed with the
newly developed laminar burning velocity correlations of methanol
and gasoline in combination with the mixing rule. In general, the
simulations agreed well with the experimental values. Similar to
what was found for the CFR engine, the trend going from gasoline
to methanol was not fully captured. Additionally, the results were
plotted as a function of equivalence ratio. Only for pure methanol,
the trend was captured although the equivalence ratio range was
limited in the case of methanol. Several other laminar burning ve-
locity correlations of methanol were tested. It was clear that the
newly developed correlation for methanol outperformed the other
correlations.  Finally,  the  influence  of  the  flame  initialization  and
turbulent  burning  velocity  models  was  investigated  in  the  same
way as on the CFR engine. It was again shown that changing the
flame  kernel  depending  on  the  fuel  and  on  the  operating  point
could be very effective to improve the simulations.

7.1.3. Knock modelling of pure alcohols

The development of a knock prediction model valid for light al-
cohols was discussed by Vancoillie et al. [259,260] . As described
earlier ( Section 2.5 ), the chemical kinetics of alcohol autoignition
significantly differ from those of gasoline. Existing knock predic-
tion models, developed for gasoline, will therefore likely fail.

A knock prediction model was developed based on the knock
integral approach. The principal building block for such a model
is an expression for autoignition delay time at instantaneous in-
cylinder conditions (p, T and mixture composition). This quantity
was  calculated  using  chemical  kinetics  and  the  resulting  values
were fit into a correlation. The employed mechanism was validated
for autoignition kinetics using published delay time data. From this
study  it  appeared  that  trends  for  varying  temperature,  pressure
and  equivalence  ratio  are  well  predicted,  but  the  absolute  value
of autoignition delay might be slightly too low at the temperature
conditions relevant to engine knock.

A  preliminary  validation  of  the  knock  prediction  routines
against measurements obtained on the same engine illustrated that
despite  the  gross  simplifications,  the  developed  model  can  yield
useful results for quantities relevant to knock. The effects of load
and  compression  ratio  on  knock  were  adequately  predicted.  The
largest model inaccuracies occurred for varying equivalence ratio.
The  authors  stated  that  this  is  probably  caused  by  an  incorrect
representation of the thermal effects of changing equivalence ra-
tio and that the use of more advanced wall heat transfer models
and inclusion of evaporation cooling in future work might resolve
this.

7.1.4. Knock modelling of alcohol-gasoline blends

In order to better understand and predict the knock behavior
of alcohol blends, a mixing rule for the autoignition delay time of
alcohol-gasoline blends was proposed by Sileghem et al. [32] (see
Section 2.8.8 ) and evaluated in a simulation model. This energy-
based mixing rule was used together with an autoignition delay
time correlation of gasoline and an autoignition delay time correla-
tion of methanol in a knock integral model that was implemented
in a two-zone engine code. To validate the proposed model, knock
occurrence  was  experimentally  investigated  on  a  CFR  engine  for
four  methanol-gasoline  blends  (gasoline,  M50,  M75  and  M100).
Experimental metrics of knock included knock limited spark ad-
vance (KLSA), fraction of knocking cycles, knock onset timing and
knock intensity based on the signal energy of heat release rate os-
cillations.  The  proposed  correlation  and  knock  integral  approach
performed satisfactorily despite the gross simplification associated
with two-zone modeling (no hot spots, no cyclic variation). The ex-
perimental KLSA was more advanced than the simulated KLSA. The
knock integral exceeded 1 before the end of combustion at less ad-
vanced spark timing than the experimental KLSA. Therefore, a sec-
ond condition was used in this study to identify knock based on
unburned mass fraction and the crank angle at knock onset which
gave better agreement. Secondly, the agreement between the sim-
ulated knock intensity and the experimental knock intensity was
better if the pressure and temperature at knock onset were taken
into account because the temperature and the pressure will change
going from gasoline to methanol and both have an influence on the
gas properties and as a result on the knock oscillations. This was
done by including the crank angle of knock onset at KLSA into the
knock intensity equation as this reflects the necessary conditions
for autoignition of the fuel which are influenced by temperature
and pressure. Finally, the model was able to predict almost all the
knock onsets within the error margins of the experimental knock
onset.

7.1.5. In-cylinder heat transfer sub-model

Demuynck evaluated experimental data obtained in a CFR en-
gine covering a wide range of fuels and engine operation condi-
tions  in  an  attempt  to  develop  a  fuel  independent  heat  transfer
model for spark ignition engines [261–263] . Existing heat flux cor-
relations were shown to reproduce the heat flux trace at constant
operating  point  for  methane  and  methanol.  However,  Demuynck
demonstrated that, for methanol and especially hydrogen, existing
heat flux correlations are unable to predict changes in heat flux
during combustion for large variations in mixture equivalence ra-
tio. It was also shown that, if properly calibrated, the Woschni cor-
relation  could  accurately  reproduce  the  heat  flux  trace  at  a  cer-
tain operating point. However, the model failed to predict trends
in peak and total heat flux for large variation in equivalence ratio.
Adjustments were proposed by Demuynck to improve the ex-
isting heat transfer models: the correct determination of the gas
properties and the coupling to a two-zone combustion model. The
results showed that these two adjustments indeed significantly in-
creased the accuracy. Calculating the gas properties with the cor-
rect polynomials and mixing laws enabled the accurate simulation
of  the  variation  in  the  heat  flux  during  the  compression  stroke.
The coupling to a two-zone combustion model resulted in accu-
rate simulations for methane over the entire parameter space, but
not for hydrogen and methanol. Finally, the proper definitions of
the characteristic length and velocity were investigated to further
improve the simulations for hydrogen and methanol. The results
showed that significant steps were taken towards a fuel indepen-
dent heat transfer model. However, the improved model formula-
tion suggested by Demuynck has not been evaluated yet on other
alcohol engine datasets.

When modelling alcohol engines it has been proven to be im-
portant to include “puddling” submodels, to account for the time
needed  for  fuel  evaporation.  Especially  DI  engines  require  a  de-
scription of cylinder wall wetting and subsequent fuel evaporation.
Marriott et al. [160] reported this is particularly important for fu-
els with a high latent heat of vaporization such as light alcohols.
If fuel evaporation is assumed to be either instantaneous and com-
plete on injection, or happening instantaneously at time of ignition
this will result in incorrect predictions of wall heat transfer and
volumetric efficiency. Marriott proposed a simple model based on
geometrical and empirical spray parameters.

Commercial  simulation  software  such  as  GT-Power  [264]  of-
fers the ability to model the deposition of fuel, subsequent evap-
oration,  droplet  entrainment  and  transport  of  liquid  fuel  to  the
cylinder by shear forces. This model is generally only required to
study transient phenomena, but proved crucial to accurately pre-
dict the volumetric efficiency in alcohol-fueled engines [260] . Van-
coillie demonstrated this by successfully predicting both volumet-
ric efficiency and compression slope in the gas dynamics models
of a methanol fueled CFR engine [259] .

7.1.6. Fuel reforming

To further boost the efficiency of a methanol fueled engine, a
fuel reformer can be added to reform the methanol to syngas, as
explained in Section 6 . By doing this, the complexity of the system
increases a lot. Thus, simulations will play a key role in the opti-
mization of such a system. Additional submodels for the reformer
will have to be integrated in the predictive engine model as well
as adaptations of the current heat transfer and combustion models.
As the laminar burning velocity of a fuel is a base parameter for
any predictive engine combustion model, Nguyen et al. [265] has
developed  new  laminar  burning  velocity  models  for  two  engine
concepts with methanol fuel steam reforming to support simula-
tions. One concept uses water from an extra tank to produce hy-
drogen rich gas (syngas) in a reformer heated by the exhaust gases
and the other concept employs the water vapor in the exhaust gas
recirculation stream to produce reformed EGR. A 1D flame simu-
lation tool with a comprehensive chemical kinetic mechanism to
predict the laminar burning velocities of methanol/syngas blends
was  used  to  generate  data.  This  data  was  used  to  develop  new
correlations. The simulations were performed over syngas ratios,
fuel-air equivalence ratios, temperatures, pressures and EGR levels
ranging from 0% to 50% by volume, 0.5 to 1.5, 550 to 800 K, 10
to 85 bar, and 0% to 30% by mass, respectively. Some experimen-
tal data for laminar burning velocity of reformates is available in
literature [266] . Although this is limited to atmospheric conditions
for temperature and pressure, the database covers a wide range of
mixture compositions and can thus be used to validate chemical
kinetic simulations.

Nguyen et al. [233] also calculated that the concept with the re-
formed EGR technology was the more promising approach to sup-
port high levels of EGR dilution in SI engines for increased thermal
efficiency due to faster laminar burning velocities. However, no ex-
periments have yet been reported validating this.

Poran and Tartakovsky are one of the few that have done exten-
sive research on fuel reforming of methanol in combination with
an internal combustion engine [232,242,267] . They ran simulations
using  a  GT-Power  model  of  an  engine  with  a  reformer  utilizing
steam reforming of methanol [267] . They focused on direct injec-
tion  of  the  reformate  in  order  to  maintain  the  power  output  of
the engine and to prevent abnormal combustion phenomena. They
found that compressing the reformate gas to high pressures to en-
able late fuel injection is not energetically efficient and nonviable
if reforming is carried out at atmospheric pressure. It was shown
that it is possible to reduce the energy required for fuel compres-
sion  by  compressing  the  liquid  fuel  prior  to  its  evaporation  and

by reforming the methanol at high pressure. In this way, efficiency
improvements of 12-14% compared with a DI gasoline fueled en-
gine were simulated. In a later stage, Poran and Tartakovsky in-
vestigated these findings experimentally [232] by feeding an en-
gine with a mixture of 75% H
2 from gas bottles. They
showed an improvement in efficiency of 18-39% compared to the
base, carburetted gasoline engine.

2 and 25% CO

7.2. Multidimensional models

Multi-dimensional simulations can be used to investigate cer-
tain engine-related phenomena in more detail. Fuel impingement
and puddling, a particular problem for light alcohol fuels, have of-
ten  been  studied  this  way.  Ramadan  et  al.  [268]  have  used  the
KIVA-3V code to investigate the effect of swirl and fuel impinge-
ment  on  methanol  combustion  in  several  engine  configurations
with direct injection and a compression ratio of 17:1. Pontoppidan
et al. [269] used the same code to perform a cold start study for a
pure ethanol PFI engine, focusing on intake port fuel puddling. In
both studies the alcohol combustion was modeled as a single-step
irreversible reaction in Arrhenius form.

Zhen  et  al.  [270]  performed  a  multidimensional  study  of
combustion  and  knock  occurrence  in  a  high  compression  ratio
methanol  engine  using  the  Coherent  Flame  Model  for  turbulent
combustion with a knock prediction model developed for primary
reference fuels. They found that knock can be suppressed by re-
tarding  spark  timing,  leaning  or  enriching  the  mixture,  diluting
the mixture with EGR and changing the shape of the combustion
chamber.

Lauer et al. [271] used information obtained using 3D CFD to
create  a  model  of  wall  film  formation  in  inlet  ports  and  ther-
mal models of port walls, for use in quasi-dimensional models of
ethanol-fueled engines. They reported that ignoring the fuel pud-
dling dynamics can lead to overestimations of the unburned gas
temperature of 20 °C, leading to incorrect predictions of volumet-
ric efficiency and knock tendency. Similarly, Marriott et al. [160] re-
port that simulation of engines with direct injection of light alco-
hol fuels must consider fuel impingement to provide accurate re-
sults of volumetric efficiency and wall heat loss. The authors there-
fore developed a geometry based fuel impingement model. Vapor-
ization  dynamics  are  especially  important  during  cold  start.  For
this reason, Yao et al. [272] and Liebsch et al. [273] have recently
developed models for the vaporization of ethanol-blended fuels in
port fuel injected and direct injected engines respectively, in order
to predict the required enrichment for cold start.

The  simulation  results  of  Jangi  et  al.  [274]  also  illustrate  the
effects of methanol evaporation. They used unsteady RANS simu-
lations for the gas phase and Lagrangian particle tracking for the
spray, of a Scania D13 heavy duty diesel engine running on pure
methanol, with a compression ratio of 15:1 in which the start of
injection (SOI) was varied. Early SOI resulted in HCCI-type combus-
tion and needed almost 70 crank angle degrees to evaporate the
injected methanol. Delaying the SOI led to PPC combustion, with
the start of combustion only happening 7 crank angle degrees af-
ter the injection had ended. This is caused by the high heat of va-
porization and the high autoignition temperature of methanol. As
a  consequence,  the  mixture  is  lean  everywhere,  on  ignition.  Pu-
cilowski  et  al.  [214]  continued  work  on  this  case,  including  SOI
timings that led to diesel-like combustion (partly premixed, partly
diffusion burn) and investigating the effects of a double injection.
This was done in an attempt to lower the pressure rise rate, that
was excessive for the PPC-type combustion. They showed a high
sensitivity to SOI, with combustion changing from HCCI-like com-
bustion  to  diesel-like  combustion  on  variation  of  SOI  over  some
30 crank angle degrees. They also found the inherently long mix-
ing times to potentially lead to unburned methanol emissions by

ending up with a lot of fuel near the chamber walls, something
that can be improved upon with SOI timing and multiple injec-
tions. Turbulence-chemistry coupling was assumed to be properly
handled by a well-stirred reactor (WSR) approach and chemistry
coordinate mapping (CCM) was used to enable the inclusion of de-
tailed chemical kinetics without leading to excessive computational
time. The use of a WSR for the later SOI with partly diffusion com-
bustion is debatable but was still used to limit computational cost.
Summarizing the modelling work on methanol engines, impor-
tant initial steps have been taken but clearly this has been much
less investigated than e.g. gasoline or diesel engine modelling. Next
steps are recommended in the following section.

8. Conclusions, outlook and recommendations

As explained in the introductory sections, methanol is a com-
pelling fuel for internal combustion engines. It has been investi-
gated in the past, initially as a knock-resistant fuel, then as a fuel
that  could  be  produced  from  non-fossil-oil  sources,  and  then  –
most extensively – as a fuel that enabled a substantial improve-
ment in air quality. These last two reasons are the major drivers
for the present large scale application in passenger cars and trucks
in China. With upcoming tightening emission legislation for seafar-
ing vessels, methanol is also gaining interest for marine application
with some initial ship conversions having been demonstrated.

Apart from potentially burning cleaner and improving air qual-
ity,  methanol  has  also  been  advanced  as  a  long-term  renewable
fuel. Of the fuels that can be synthesized using renewable sources,
it is the most simple fuel that is liquid at atmospheric conditions.
It thus offers the potential of zero net carbon emissions while be-
ing practical in use. The practicality, along with not relying on any
scarce resource for its manufacturing or use, translates to scalabil-
ity: there are no inherent bottlenecks in scaling up the production
of methanol to meet the enormous needs of today’s transportation
sector.

Of course, methanol’s synthesis requires carbon. Initial produc-
2  emitted  from  so-called
tion  could  make  use  of  biomass  or  CO
2 yearly. These
point sources: sources emitting over 100 ktons of CO
sources emit approximately half of the anthropogenic CO
2  emis-
sions worldwide [4] . In the long term however, in order to reach
2  must  also  be  captured  from  dif-
zero  net  carbon  emission,  CO
fuse sources. This requires the development of direct air capture.
Clearly, there are a lot of open questions not related to engines,
on efficiency of synthesis, cost, feasibility of direct air capture etc.
Data are needed so that well-to-tank numbers can be calculated. If
this is broadened to life cycle analysis (LCA), i.e. it includes vehicle
production and dismantling, this actually holds for all alternatives
to the present day fossil fuels: there are many uncertainties on re-
source use, mining impact, energy needs for recycling, etc. What is
certain is that change is needed, both to improve air quality and
to combat global warming. Numerous alternatives to fossil-fuelled
combustion engine vehicles have been advanced and those with
the highest potential need to be identified by analyzing the facts.
This means an urgent need for detailed data, broader than well-to-
wheel energy use (by which simple metric every vehicle should be
electrically driven). For those applications where fuels synthesized
from renewable sources make sense, methanol is more attractive
versus for instance synthetic gasoline from a production efficiency
point of view (well-to-tank).

The present paper focussed on methanol’s use in combustion
engines,  and  thus  mainly  studied  the  tank-to-wheel  part.  It  has
reviewed  methanol’s  properties  as  an  engine  fuel  to  clarify  the
increased engine efficiencies recorded on methanol, compared to
e.g.  gasoline  engines.  A  number  of  properties  allow  higher  peak
efficiencies to be obtained, with relative efficiency increases of the
order  of 25% having been reported, for (downsized) engines de-

82

signed to operate on gasoline. This begs the question of what the
actual efficiency potential would be if an engine design were to
be  fully  optimized  for  methanol’s  properties.  Another  5  to  10%
would seem fairly easy to obtain when looking at the more ex-
tensive data available for ethanol-fuelled engines. The review has
offered a number of suggestions for tailoring design features for
methanol use. Additionally, it would be interesting to investigate
how such a dedicated methanol engine would still be able to run
on gasoline with the necessary engine management interventions
to enable this (e.g. using variable valve timing to reduce effective
compression ratio, reducing boost pressure and retarding spark ad-
vance), and what the power and efficiency demerit would then be
when such an engine is operated on gasoline. Importantly, offering
flex-fuel capability would help with market introduction because
the vehicle could still be fuelled on gasoline in extremis , alleviating
any range anxiety. Also, a significant performance reduction when
using gasoline might be expected to be an incentive for the driver
to use only the minimum amount of gasoline to provide range to a
methanol fuel station and so, if such methanol were of lower car-
bon footprint than gasoline, would help to encourage take-up of
the more environmentally-friendly fuel.

Probably even more important for real-world impact is the po-
tential for increased part-load efficiency, since this will affect driv-
ing cycle efficiency (both legislated and real-world). Actual num-
bers  are  rather  limited  but  seem  to  point  to  25%  relative  ef-
ficiency  improvement  over  gasoline,  which  however  would  re-
quire engine adaptations so as to better exploit methanol’s char-
acteristics  for  dethrottling  the  engine.  Crucially,  even  for  non-
optimized (i.e. gasoline) engines the data typically show increased
efficiency (of the order of 5 to 10%). Thus, tank-to-wheel efficiency
on methanol clearly is higher than for gasoline. However, exper-
imental  results  are  still  rather  limited  so  more  work  would  be
beneficial, especially exploiting state-of-the-art engine technology
(e.g. stratified combustion, highly flexible valvetrains, variable ge-
ometry turbines). Also, work is needed to explore potential effi-
ciency benefits (if any) of thermochemical recuperation (fuel re-
forming using waste heat).

The potential of new concepts (such as partially premixed com-
bustion or MD95), when operated on methanol, is largely unex-
plored but initial work looks promising so again, more data would
be useful. With such data, one could study the best strategy for ob-
taining high overall efficiency: a stoichiometrically operated (over
the entire engine map) downsized direct-injection spark ignition
engine  with  a  three-way  catalyst  (TWC)  for  aftertreatment,  or  a
stoichiometric compression ignition engine with TWC, or a PPC en-
gine with a simple oxidation catalyst, etc. It also seems interesting
to revisit some of the older concepts such as glow plug engines.
Clearly  we  have  just  started  mapping  the  potential  of  methanol
with state-of-the-art engine technology. As mentioned above, there
is more data available for ethanol, so one could start from this fuel
for LCA numbers. Application and improvement of simulation tools
would also be of great help in completing the picture.

As  the  current  use  of  methanol  in  China  and  the  large  scale
demonstration  in  California  indicate,  there  are  no  technical  or
safety-related reasons  for  discarding  methanol  as  a  viable  trans-
portation  fuel.  However,  its  properties  are  clearly  different  from
gasoline’s so one should bear these in mind when using methanol.
For  example,  mixing  methanol  into  pump  gasoline  can  lead  to
problems:  such  a  ‘splash  blend’  is  not  a  drop-in  fuel  and  will
lead to potential problems such as increased evaporative emissions.
When blending in methanol, the base gasoline should be chosen
such that vapour pressures are within acceptable bounds. There are
various options to introduce at least some methanol now, without
the immediate need for specifically designed vehicles. First of all,
both the CEN gasoline standard EN228 and the ASTM D4814-10a
standard already allows blending in methanol at low percentages.

Second, GEM blends can principally be used in flex-fuel vehicles
developed for the use of E85, of which over 50 million vehicles
have been sold. Nevertheless, few data are available on blend prop-
erties. More data on water tolerance, phase separation and suitable
co-solvents would remove barriers for the uptake of such GEM fu-
els.

Also, in China flex-fuel vehicles for M85 have been developed,
as well as conversion kits for retrofitting gasoline cars to be M100
compatible cars. When properly executed, i.e. with proper calibra-
tion for high-level methanol blends, pollutant emissions have been
shown to be below gasoline levels. However, more data are needed
on PN emissions, this being a fairly recent addition to some emis-
sion legislation and so a topic that has not received much attention
yet, at least not for methanol fuelling. Connected to this is work on
the effectiveness of aftertreatment for these emissions.

Besides the desired additional research at engine level, previous
sections also highlighted a need for a better understanding of some
of the processes taking place in engines. As is the case for other fu-
els, there is very limited data on laminar burning velocity and ig-
nition delay at the pressures encountered in combustion engines.
Such data would also serve in extended validation of reaction ki-
netics or improvement in the reaction schemes. Compared to com-
monly used liquid fuels today, little is known on methanol sprays
(again, at engine conditions). Naturally, improving the understand-
ing of the base phenomena would also enable the improvement of
modelling tools. As pointed out in the section on modelling, engine
cycle results are sensitive to (besides uncertainties in the laminar
burning velocity) the initialization of combustion (initial flame de-
velopment) and the proper inclusion of fuel evaporation, both of
which are fuel dependent.

Building and operating some demonstrator vehicles would be
immensely useful, since real-world data can be taken and knowl-
edge gained of how well such technologies can be deployable in
society.  Captive  fleets,  where  the  vehicles  return  to  base  to  re-
fuel,  would  seem  a  good  initial  target  for  a  fully-optimized  en-
gine. These could include heavy-duty SI methanol engines as well
as ones employing PPC; operation of such fleets with their depot-
sited  pumps  would  minimize  the  risk  of  misfuelling  with  gaso-
line (or diesel). In terms of optimized engines retaining flex-fuel
capability,  the  SI  engines  with  heavy  optimization  for  methanol
mentioned above could be used, but with an alcohol sensor and
a  protection  calibration  for  gasoline.  As  mentioned  this  would
alleviate  concerns  about  running  out  of  methanol  between  fill-
ing  stations  as  the  infrastructure  is  developed  concurrently.  Fi-
nally, another possibility is for octane-on-demand demonstration,
where methanol is the octane booster; while most such research
has been done with one of the fuels being directly-injected and
the other provided through a PFI system, it is possible that most
of  the  benefits  could  be  realized  with  both  fuels  being  intro-
duced  at  the  port.  Such  an  engine  might  be  very  cost  effective
indeed and give excellent efficiency on gasoline at part load (be-
cause of the high compression ratio that the OOD approach per-
mits), providing immediate cost of ownership benefits to the end
user.  Furthermore,  through  the  reduction  in  tailpipe  CO
2  emis-
sions in combination with the possibly eliminated requirement for
a  gasoline  particulate  filter  because  of  the  removal  of  direct  in-
jection,  this  arrangement  could  be  extremely  attractive  to  OEMs
too.

The  discussion  above  has  been  heavily  condensed  in  the  fol-
lowing  wrap-up.  First,  to  summarize  the  advantages  and  chal-
lenges with the use of methanol as a fuel, Fig. 25 offers a general
schematic linking methanol’s properties to engine performance. As
previous sections showed, the reality is usually that one ends up
with trade-offs so this figure should not be used as is but should
be used together with the relevant sections where a more com-
plete picture is given.

Low lubricity (fuel injectors)

Second,  in  terms  of  the  fuel  system  and  fuel  handling,
methanol’s advantages and disadvantages have been summarized
in Table 7 .

Finally, the recommendations for future research and demon-

stration proposed by us above are, summarized:

• To enable comparison of methanol-fuelled vehicles using ICEs
to other alternatives: data is needded on life cycle energy and
material use as well as pollutant emissions, of methanol as well
as vehicle production and use. Which itself relies on the follow-
ing point ...

• Assessment of the efficiency potential of a dedicated methanol
engine, at peak and part load, exploiting state-of-the-art engine
technology.

• Strategies for these engines to enable the use of gasoline (for a

• As another important way of introducing methanol is its blend-
ing with gasoline, more data on water tolerance, phase separa-
tion etc. of these blends are needed.

• Clarifying  PN  and  aldehyde  emissions  from  methanol  fuelled
operation (engine-out emissions and aftertreatment efficiency).
• Completing the fundamental data, e.g. on burning velocities, ig-

nition delay times, sprays ...

• Improving simulation tools to better capture the effects of using

methanol fuel.

• Demonstrator vehicles to collect real-world data and showcase

methanol’s potential.

• Investigating the cost effectiveness of the different octane-on-

demand concepts possible with methanol.

Leeds University (UK) as an EC Marie Curie Fellow. He has
led multiple national and international projects on alter-
native fuels, in-cylinder heat transfer, and medium speed
diesel engines. He has authored over 70 papers in inter-
national journals, 5 book chapters and over 100 papers
in the proceedings of international conferences. Dr. Ver-
helst was president of the Belgian Society of Automotive
Engineers (UBIA) between 2011 and 2017, and served as vice-chair of the Scien-
tific&Technical Committee of the FISITA 2014 World Automotive Congress. He has
been awarded with the 2005 VDK Prize for Sustainable Development for his PhD,
