This article provides a comprehensive review of the spray combustion of fast pyrolysis bio-oil (FPBO, also 
called bio-oil, pyrolysis oil or pyrolysis liquid biofuel), which is widely regarded as one of the most eco- 
nomically feasible renewable resources to facilitate the replacement of fossil oils. The utilization of FPBO 
as a fuel is challenging due to its unique atomization and combustion characteristics but it is important 
given the need to develop a more sustainable energy infrastructure. Signiﬁcant effort s have been made 
in utilizing FPBO as a practical alternative fuel and the ﬁrst FPBO facilities for heat and/or power gen- 
eration have been brought online in recent years. FPBO-fueled burners, boilers, and furnaces are ready 
from a technical perspective for large-scale industrial use, and even small-scale systems show excellent 
ﬂame stability, low emissions, and minimal requirements for secondary fuel usage. FPBO applications in 
gas turbine and compression-ignition engines are technically more challenging, currently having had only 
limited successes in larger-scale units and for short time intervals in smaller ones. With recent research 
and technological advances, however, FPBO use in small-scale combustion engines appears to be techni- 
cally feasible. In the literature, extensive research efforts have been dedicated to this topic either as a 
fuel itself or its utilization for practical applications. Nonetheless, inadequate considerations have been 
given to the critical role of FPBO atomization and its subsequent fuel/air mixing, which in turn controls 
the combustion eﬃciency and emission characteristics of a system. Understanding the spray combustion 
properties of FPBO is especially important because of the fuel’s unfavorable properties compared to fossil 
oils including low energy density, high viscosity, high water content, containing suspended solid partic- 
ulates and non-volatile residue, chemical instability, and an incompatibility with conventional fossil oils. 
The information presented herein, therefore, focuses on understanding the challenges and constraints 
that are unique to FPBO applications, along with proposing several strategies to properly atomize and 
combust this fuel in order to enhance combustion eﬃciency and reduce pollutant emissions in practical 
systems. Although substantial progress has been made in understanding the FPBO spray combustion as 
revealed by this review, better standardization of FPBO properties, more eﬃcient techniques for optimiz- 
ing atomization and combustion for different applications, and more studies to understand the long-term 
reliability of devices running on FPBO are needed.

1. Introduction 

Reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  is  one  of  the  issues  in- 
ﬂuencing  energy  and  environmental  policy  worldwide.  Combus- 
tion systems using fossil fuels contributed to 81.3% of the world’s 
energy  supply  while  producing  99.3%  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO 
2 ) 
emissions  in  2017  [1] .  In  fact,  in  the  near  future,  global  energy 
needs  are  expected  to  rapidly  increase  as  developing  countries 
and economies with large populations continue to grow [2] . Fur- 
thermore,  statistics  jointly  released  by  NASA  and  NOAA  suggest 
that  2019  was  the  second  warmest  year  on  record  and  the  pe- 
riod between 2015 and 2019 were the top-ﬁve record-warm years 
for globe [3] . The temperature deﬁning a “tipping point” for irre- 
versible climate change is the subject of great debate, but trends 
show that global warming is an accelerating process [3] , illustrat- 
ing that real energy and environmental innovations are imperative 
in order to create a more environmentally sustainable and prosper- 
ous global economy moving forward. 

Although  the  reliance  on  combustion  as  a  worldwide  energy 
source is unlikely to decrease signiﬁcantly in the near future, fuel 
sources  themselves  can  be  made  more  environmentally  friendly 
while  minimizing  the  consumption  of  non-renewable  resources. 
Direct combustion of biomass, as a solid fuel, is disadvantageous 
since it is plagued by low eﬃciencies and higher amounts of emis- 
sion, particularly with respect to particulate matter [4 , 5] , in com- 
parison with liquid biofuels. Furthermore, liquid biofuels are eas- 
ier  to  transport  (i.e.  higher  bulk  density)  and  store  (under  con- 
trolled conditions) than solid biomass [6] . With regards to sustain- 
able liquid fuels, fast pyrolysis bio-oil (FPBO) created from biomass 
(which already supplies about 10.4% of the world’s energy [1] ) is 
widely regarded as one of the most feasible renewable resources 
to facilitate the replacement of petroleum-derived liquid fuels (so- 
called fossil oils) [7 , 8] . It is the lowest cost liquid biofuel available 

[9 , 10] . A detailed life cycle assessment concluded that greenhouse 
gas emissions from power generation could be reduced by 77–99% 
just by switching current facilities over to FPBO rather than con- 
tinuing to run on fossil oil, natural gas, or coal [11] . One of the 
advantages of FPBO compared to its biomass feedstock is associ- 
ated with the removal of a large fraction of ash contained in the 
original biomass [12] . The ash can then be used, for example, as 
soil amendment [13] . The potential of FPBO as a renewable carbon- 
neutral source of energy with lower harmful emissions than fossil 
oils [14 , 15] , therefore, has made it an important factor for the fu- 
ture health of the global energy economy. 

Biomass-derived  fuels  can  be  sourced  from  a  number  of  dif- 
ferent  feedstocks.  First  generation  biofuels,  such  as  ethanol  and 
biodiesel,  are  created  from  edible  feedstocks  and  most  are  no 
longer thought to signiﬁcantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, 
and are also economically and environmentally unsustainable mov- 
ing forward [16 , 17] . On the other hand, second generation biofu- 
els, such as FPBO, made from non-edible biomass feedstocks in- 
cluding waste, can be carbon-neutral and are more sustainable be- 
cause they do not compete for agricultural space or with the food 
supply,  and  thus  have  not  caused  food  prices  to  rise  [14 , 17 , 18] . 
FPBO  can  be  made  from  a  wide  variety  of  biomass  feedstocks 
[19] , but it is commonly lignocellulosic materials generated from 
waste wood.  The quality of  the wood  (or other  biomass source) 
is one of the most important factors which determines the qual- 
ity  of  the  ﬁnal  produced  fuel  [20 , 21] .  Wood  feedstocks  provide 
the best quality second generation biomass-derived fuel because 
of  their  higher  energy  density  and  yield  along  with  their  lower 
ash,  nitrogen,  and  water  content  compared  to  fuels  made  from 
other feedstocks [9 , 22–26] . While the ﬁrst and second generation 
biofuels are being produced in commercial quantities, there exists 
third and fourth generation of biofuels whose large-scale produc- 
tion has not been carried out yet due to insuﬃcient biomass feed-

stocks, high production cost, as well as environmental and health 
concerns [27 , 28] . The third and fourth generation biofuels use the 
algae-to-biofuel strategy [29] . In third generation technologies, al- 
gal biomass is treated for biofuel production, whereas the fourth 
generation approach utilizes genetically modiﬁed algae to enhance 
biofuel production [27 , 28] . 

Given the continually increasing need for environmentally sus- 
tainable fuel, FPBO research and commercialization across the ma- 
jor combustion industries is progressing and international studies 
on FPBO production are being undertaken by the International En- 
ergy Agency (IEA) [30 , 31] . Fuel speciﬁcations are being standard- 
ized  [32–35]  to  provide  consistent  fuel  quality  which  is  critical 
moving  forward.  Nonetheless,  FPBO’s  chemical  composition  and 
physical  properties  present  unique  atomization  and  combustion 
challenges  that  need  to  be  addressed  prior  to  its  use  in  practi- 
cal combustors. For instance, FPBO combustion generates oxides of 
nitrogen (NO x ) and particulate matter (PM) emissions in varying 
amounts, while incomplete FPBO combustion also results in emis- 
sions of carbon monoxide (CO) and unburned hydrocarbons (UHC). 
All of these emissions can be harmful to human and/or environ- 
mental health and should be tackled in different FPBO combustion 
applications [36 , 37] . 

FPBO has the potential to be used in burners, boilers, and fur- 
naces,  as  well  as  gas  turbine  and  compression-ignition  engines 
[8 , 9 , 38] .  These  applications  all  have  varying  requirements  along 
with a wide range of operational standards for achieving high ef- 
ﬁciencies, which requires novel combustion strategies for running 
on alternative fuels. While FPBO is replacing natural gas and light 
and heavy fuel oils in commercial applications, light fuel oil re- 
placement  likely  has  the  greatest  economic  incentives  [39] .  Cur- 
rently,  FPBO  is  beginning  to  replace  fossil  oils  in  large-scale  in- 
dustrial burners, furnaces and boilers [8 , 38 , 40] . For instance, Ensyn 
Technologies Inc. is producing about 140,0 0 0 L/day of FPBO [41 , 42] 
(with three times more production capability under development 
[43 , 44] ) and has also switched multiple industrial heating appli- 
cations from fossil oils to FPBO since 2014 [45] . In addition, the 
world’s ﬁrst combined heat and power plant running on FPBO was 
commissioned in 2013 by Fortum in Finland [46] . In such large- 
scale applications, hot-zone residence times are long and fractional 
heat losses are small, and thus high FPBO combustion eﬃciency is 
simpler to achieve. However, the use of FPBO in smaller combus- 
tion devices, such as gas turbine and compression-ignition engines, 
where natural gas and light fuel oils typically dominate, is still in 
the research and development stage with some successful demon- 
strations available [47 , 48] . In these applications, combustion must 
take place within a short time frame and small volume, still re- 
quiring high combustion eﬃciency in order to maintain low emis- 
sions. This is particularly important for small devices as the rela- 
tive cost of exhaust gas cleaning techniques is often substantial. As 
such, while spray combustion quality is important for all FPBO uti- 
lizations, it is even more crucial for the smaller combustors which 
require comparatively rapid rates of fuel/oxidant mixing and com- 
bustion. 

During the past three decades, many review articles have been 
published examining the fuel itself (e.g., [14 , 20–22 , 49–53] ) and/or 
its practical applications (e.g., [8 , 38 , 48 , 54–57] ), but they have often 
understated the critical role that FPBO atomization and combus- 
tion processes play in the performance and emissions of a com- 
bustion system. The combustion characteristics of any liquid fuel 
is known to be governed by the fuel atomization (i.e., spray forma- 
tion procedure) [58] . In fact, an eﬃcient spray combustion requires 
the  fuel  to  vaporize  and  mix  properly  with  the  oxidizer,  ignite 
and completely burn within the limited residence time and vol- 
ume of the combustor. For these processes to occur, a suﬃciently 
ﬁne-droplet spray with a uniform distribution in a combustor is re- 
quired. This is particularly important when using FPBO with its un- 

favorable characteristics, such as low energy density, high viscos- 
ity, high water content, suspended solid particulates, non-volatile 
residue, chemical instability and an incompatibility with conven- 
tional fossil oils [38] . For example, the poor atomization and slow 
ignition of FPBO are mainly attributed to its high viscosity and lim- 
ited volatility. As a result, FPBO requires more innovative strate- 
gies  for  its  complete  oxidation  compared  to  standard  fossil  oils, 
which necessitates some modiﬁcations for any system prior to be- 
ing switched over from conventional fuels. 

Motivated by the advantages of FPBO utilization as an alterna- 
tive fuel for various applications, along with the challenges of FPBO 
atomization and combustion, a review on this topic is required not 
only to examine related literature reports, but also to shed more 
light on the remaining challenges and their possible solutions. Cur- 
rently, important information is segmented and scattered between 
industrial  reports  and  academic  studies  across  various  industrial 
sectors. The present review article, therefore, aims at highlighting 
the development of FPBO spray combustion systems and compre- 
hensively unifying the wealth of information available to aid end- 
users, both novice and expert. This will be directly applicable to 
all laboratory and industrial combustion devices that wish to in- 
corporate FPBO as an energy source and will ideally serve as an 
important resource for the optimization of FPBO commercial ap- 
plications. 

While  enhanced  combustion  performance  of  FPBO  has  been 
demonstrated when blended with ethanol [48 , 59–63] or when co- 
ﬁred  with  conventional  fuels  such  as  natural  gas  [8 , 40 , 64] ,  pure 
(100%) FPBO, although a challenging fuel to work with, presents 
signiﬁcant beneﬁts. The present review article, therefore, takes a 
comprehensive  approach  to  FPBO  spray  combustion,  but  has  ex- 
cluded studies in which the fuel tested was not comprised of at 
least 60% FPBO. Some relevant topics are included for complete- 
ness, for example FPBO emulsions, but the subject matter was not 
reviewed thoroughly. Moreover, while there are numerous pyroly- 
sis production methods and feedstocks, crude wood-derived FPBOs 
are emphasized throughout this review, but some studies concern- 
ing the use of upgraded FPBOs or other types of pyrolysis fuels are 
included if relevant. 

In  this  review  article,  after  providing  some  background  in- 
formation  regarding  the  FPBO  production  and  fuel  properties  in 
Section  2 ,  the  FPBO  applications  along  with  their  corresponding 
challenges are introduced in Section 3 . Knowing about the fuel it- 
self is a great help in understanding the origin of diﬃculties as- 
sociated with its utilization. Sections 4 and 5 review the under- 
lying physics of FPBO atomization and spray combustion, respec- 
tively, and based on those concepts, several strategies for proper 
atomization and combustion of FPBO are proposed to enhance the 
eﬃciency and reduce the exhaust emissions of different combus- 
tion systems. Finally, remaining challenges, future research oppor- 
tunities, and concluding remarks of FPBO utilization for different 
applications are discussed. 

2. Fast pyrolysis bio-oil (FPBO): production and fuel properties 

FPBO provides a promising and inexpensive alternative to fos- 
sil oils, however its chemical composition and physical properties 
compared  to  that  of  standard  fuels  is  very  different  and  there- 
fore, so is its atomization and combustion characteristics, neces- 
sitating special considerations. In essence, FPBO characteristics de- 
pend highly upon the composition of biomass feedstock, the type 
of pyrolysis process and post-production upgrading (if any used), 
and the age of the sample [8 , 14 , 20 , 40 , 49] . In this section, there- 
fore, following a brief description on a common method of FPBO 
production in Section 2.1 , the typical FPBO physicochemical prop- 
erties relevant to spray combustion applications are reviewed in

grade the FPBO properties are discussed in Section 2.3 . 

the original feedstock and as a liquid, is much more easily trans- 
portable [6] . 

2.1. Production 

2.2. Physicochemical properties 

FPBO  is  produced  using  the  fast  pyrolysis  method  which  in- 
volves  the  decomposition  (or  thermal  cracking)  of  the  biomass 
feedstock in the absence of oxygen at 350–550 °C [20 , 65] . Other 
pyrolysis processes that yield biofuels of different properties will 
not be discussed in this review. The pyrolysis vapors have a short 
residence  time  of  up  to  two  seconds  during  processing,  before 
being quenched to form a liquid biofuel. Longer residence times 
will reduce the fuel’s average molecular weight, but also decom- 
pose  the  feedstock  into  additional  non-condensable  gases  which 
will lower the liquid fuel yield [65] . Increasing production temper- 
atures also results in reduced oil output yields [66] . Furthermore, 
while different manufacturers have different production processes, 
quenching  and  condensation  temperatures  have  been  shown  to 
have  no  real  effect  on  capturing  additional  volatile  fuel  content 
[47] .  Process  yields  are  around  60–75  wt.%  [21 , 22 , 65]  with  by- 
products in the form of heat, char and non-condensable gases rep- 
resenting around 30% of the biomass energy. The char and non- 
condensable gases can then be used as a fuel source for maintain- 
ing the pyrolysis oil production process which requires only about 
half  of  the  available  by-product  energy  content  ( ≈ 15%)  [21 , 67] . 
The only real energy lost during fuel production is in the form of 
heat amounting to approximately 5% [68] . Consequently, the fast 
pyrolysis process requires minimal energy input from other sources 
and surplus by-products can also be used for feedstock drying and 
other purposes external to the fuel production. A schematic for the 
fast pyrolysis production process along with an image of the prod- 
uct fuel which often has a dark red-brown color (with a smoky, 
acrid odor) are shown in Fig. 1 . 

Feedstock alterations or enhancements can improve fuel qual- 
ity.  A  dry  feedstock  will  reduce  FPBO  water  content  [65]  which 
improves fuel ignition and combustion stability, but also increases 
the  fuel’s  viscosity  which  can  cause  poorer  liquid  fuel  atomiza- 
tion  [8] .  Char  removal  is  important  because  it  is  a  vapor  crack- 
ing catalyst of the pyrolysis fuel which if not removed will reduce 
the process yield [65 , 67] , age/polymerize the ﬁnal FPBO product 
[67 , 68 , 70] , and lead to PM emissions during combustion [71–73] . 
Char  is  typically  removed  with  the  use  of  cyclones  prior  to  va- 
por quenching [65] . The resulting product of the fast pyrolysis pro- 
cess has an energy density four to ﬁve times greater than that of 

Characterization  of  FPBO  is  inherently  complex  as  it  is  com- 
prised of many different groups of compounds with varying po- 
larity  and  wide  range  of  molecular  weights  and  boiling  points 
[8 , 14 , 20 , 49 , 51 , 74–77] . The FPBO’s chemical composition of FPBO in- 
cludes aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons containing carboxylic 
acid and hydroxyl groups, commonly in the form of various sub- 
stituted phenols and furanoics, which are emulsiﬁed with varying 
amounts of water [49] . The typical surrogate components chosen 
for the vaporization, kinetic or combustion modeling of FPBO are 
reported in several studies [78–84] . Notwithstanding the fact that 
the physicochemical properties of FPBO vary based upon feedstock, 
processing, upgrading, and age, a summary of its typical properties 
which are relevant to atomization and combustion are presented in 
Table 1 , along with that of light fuel oils (such as fuel oil number 
2, diesel fuel and other similar fossil oils) and heavy fuel oils (such 
as fuel oil number 6 and other similar fossil oils). Testing proce- 
dures and standards for these various properties are also available 
[34 , 35 , 85] . 

2.2.1. Water content 

The high water content (15–30 wt.%) of FPBO is from a combi- 
nation of pyrolysis reactions and the moisture content in the orig- 
inal feedstock [8 , 21 , 52 , 55] . A higher degree of vapor cracking dur- 
ing the pyrolysis process leads to a higher amount of water in the 
fuel product [24] . The higher water content of FPBO compared to 
fossil oils (see Table 1 ) leads to combustion/ﬂame instabilities be- 
cause it results in a lower energy density, delayed/poorer ignition 
from slow vaporization and reduced ﬂame temperatures and com- 
bustion rates due to the high heat capacity and high latent heat 
of vaporization of water [8 , 35 , 55 , 87] . The relatively higher surface 
tension of FPBO, which is unfavorable in its atomization, is also at- 
tributable to its water content which has strong hydrogen bonding 
[8 , 86 , 88] . On the other hand, the elevated water content in the fuel 
can be beneﬁcial by reducing the fuel’s viscosity, rate of aging, and 
NO x and soot emissions [8 , 24 , 52 , 55] . However, it is recommended 
to keep the water content below 27 wt.% [33] as too much water, 
above 30 wt.%, will cause the phase separation of the fuel during 
product recovery, handling or storage [8 , 20 , 24 , 52 , 89–91] .

2.2.2. Surface tension, density, and viscosity 

FPBO has a surface tension of around 36 mN/m at room tem- 
perature (25 °C), dropping by about 5 mN/m at 80 °C [86] , in a 
linear fashion, matching the ﬁndings from a separate study [92] , 
but  still  other  studies  have  reported  surface  tension  values  be- 
tween 31 and 40 mN/m at room temperature [24 , 55 , 93] , similar 
to that of typical vegetable oils [86] . The surface tension of FPBO 
is dependent on the fuel’s water and char content which is why 
its surface tension is higher than heavy fuel oils, which measure 
about 23 mN/m at 40 °C, and light fuel oils, which measures about 
28 mN/m at 25 °C, both of which contain no water [24 , 86] . FPBO’s 
density is also dependent on the fuels water content [8] , and is 
around  40%  higher  than  that  of  fossil  oils.  Additionally,  a  study 
found that the density of FPBO varies very little with temperature, 
exhibiting negligible thermal expansion [86] . The same study also 
discovered that when FPBO is sheared, the agglomerated char par- 
ticles break up, reducing the viscosity of the fuel which is known 
as shear-thinning; though overall the fuel behaves in a Newtonian 
manner. FPBO is considered to be a high viscosity fuel, especially 
compared to transport-grade fuels, such as diesel or gasoline. An 
analysis  of  FPBO’s  rheological  properties  found  that  their  sprays 
would likely be ﬁner than those from Number 6 heavy fuel oil us- 
ing the same nozzle and so it was concluded that from strictly an 
atomization perspective, FPBO is a suitable replacement for heavy 
fuel oils [86] . However, preheating restrictions on FPBO compared 
to heavy fuel oils, due to polymerization, could prevent "off-the- 
shelf" heavy fuel oil nozzles from being used with FPBO [94] . 

2.2.3. Oxygen content 

Pyrolysis fuel has a high oxygen content (30–40 wt.% dry) be- 
cause  it  contains  most  of  the  oxygen  in  the  original  feedstock 
[8 , 40 , 52] . This is a major distinction between FPBO and fossil oils 
which are not oxygenated as shown in Table 1 , which makes FPBO 
immiscible in fossil oils. FPBO oxygen content (on a dry basis) de- 
creases with increasing thermal cracking during FPBO production 
[95] .  The  high  oxygen  content  is  responsible  for  the  fuel’s  low 
energy density (in conjunction with the water content), corrosiv- 
ity and chemical instability/aging [8 , 24 , 40 , 52] . The organic oxygen 
content of FPBO reduces the amount of oxidizer needed for stoi- 
chiometric combustion conditions, thereby lowering the air-to-fuel 
ratio during combustion and increasing ﬂame temperatures (con- 
trary to the effect of FPBO’s water content on ﬂame temperature) 
[8 , 24 , 40] . 

2.2.4. Heating value and stoichiometric ratio 

The energy density of FPBO is typically between 30 and 45% 
of  that  found  in  standard  fossil  oils  on  a  per  mass  basis.  How- 
ever,  it  is  the  volumetric  ﬂow  rate  that  is  most  important  for 
combustion and storage considerations and, due to FPBO’s higher 
density,  its  energy  content  on  a  volumetric  basis  is  closer  to 
55%  (about  20  MJ/L  versus  36  MJ/L)  of  conventional  fossil  oils 
[24 , 40 , 52] . The lower energy density of FPBO results in a compar- 
atively higher fuel ﬂow rate during combustion for a ﬁxed energy 
throughput, requiring combustor modiﬁcations, especially with re- 
spect  to  the  nozzle  and  injection  system  in  order  to  maintain 
adequate atomization and fuel/air mixing [24 , 40 , 52 , 96] . It should 
be  noted  that  throughout  this  paper,  energy  density  refers  pri- 
marily  to  the  lower  heating  value  since  this  is  the  most  prac- 
tical  measure  of  useable  fuel  energy  content  [95] .  The  stoichio- 
metric  mass  air-to-fuel  ratio  (AFR)  of  FPBO  is  about  half  of  the 
conventional  fuel  oils  due  to  the  high  oxygen  content  of  FPBO, 
which  helps  to  offset  the  lower  energy  density  of  FPBO  com- 
pared to that of the fuel oils [24 , 38 , 40 , 61 , 97] . However, to main- 
tain a given thermal energy release rate with complete combus- 
tion  of  FPBO  and  fuel  oils,  10–20%  more  combustion  air  is  re- 
Fuel oils  is slightly smaller than 
quired for FPBO (since LHV FPBO / LHV

2.2.5. Thermal conductivity and speciﬁc heat capacity 

Thermal conductivity and speciﬁc heat capacity of fuels are es- 
sential in the design and evaluation of equipment with heat trans- 
fer,  such  as  combustors,  nozzles  and  heat  exchangers.  Over  the 
temperature range of 20–60 °C, the thermal conductivity of FPBO 
is between 0.35 and 0.43 W/mK and its speciﬁc heat capacity is 
between 2.5 and 3.8 kJ/kg K, where both values are higher than 
those of diesel fuels [8 , 40 , 52 , 53 , 85 , 99] . 

2.2.6. Acidity 

One of the most common challenges with FPBO is its acidity (a 
pH of 2–3 compared to 7 for conventional fossil oils) [40] , which 
cause corrosion that worsens at elevated temperatures and higher 
water  contents.  Detailed  experiments  have  shown  that  stainless 
steel has negligible corrosion in the presence of FPBO at elevated 
temperatures of 70 °C [96 , 100] . Pieces of plain steel (speciﬁc ma- 
terial designation unspeciﬁed) immersed in 50 °C and 90 °C FPBO 
had a 34.0 wt.% and 43.5 wt.% loss after two hours respectively 
and when immersed at 90 °C for 24 hours, it had a loss of 90 wt.%. 
Aluminum also showed poor performance in the presence of FPBO, 
but better than plain steel and brass performed fairly well, only 
showing a slight weight loss over time [55 , 99] . This fuel, therefore, 
requires all interacting components to be manufactured from cor- 
rosion resistant materials, such as stainless steel (in particular 300 
series stainless steel [9 , 55 , 101] ) or Teﬂon, which is usually more 
expensive than standard components [8 , 24 , 38 , 40 , 55 , 102–105] . This 
material  compatibility  requirement  prevents  FPBO  from  being  a 
"drop-in" fuel replacement for many applications since nozzles and 
combustors must be retroﬁtted accordingly. In addition, fuel up- 
grading, see Section 2.3 , can be used to reduce FPBO’s acidity. 

2.2.7. Phase stability and aging 

While  FPBOs  are  typically  observed  in  a  single  phase,  feed- 
stocks  with  high  content  of  extractives  and/or  high  ash  content 
commonly produce oil with a multiphase structure (comprised of 
aqueous phase, an upper layer or extractive-rich layer, and a de- 
canted  heavy  oily  phase),  leading  to  the  physical  phase  separa- 
tion of FPBO due to gravitational or centrifugal forces [20] . While 
the  aforementioned  FPBO  phase  instability  occurs  due  to  physi- 
cal phenomena, aging reactions are the results of chemical com- 
position  changes  [20] .  Fuel  aging  occurs  during  long-term  stor- 
age as the low molecular weight (LMW) compounds react to be- 
come high molecular weight (HMW) compounds (also known as 
polymerization) [14 , 38 , 52 , 70 , 87 , 106] . This happens because of the 
rapid quenching used during the fast pyrolysis production process, 
which prevents the product oil from reaching an equilibrium state. 
If given an appropriate time and temperature, the chemical species 
contained within the fuel will chemically react to approach equi- 
librium  [52 , 70 , 107] .  It  is,  therefore,  somewhat  determined  based 
on  feedstock  and  processing  [108] .  Aging  can  cause  the  fuel  to 
separate (which can be prevented with mechanical mixing [9 , 56] ), 
decrease  in  volatility  and  heating  value  and  increase  in  viscos- 
ity, non-evaporative components (including solids) and water con- 
tent; all of which degrade atomization and combustion processes 
and increase emissions [14 , 20 , 90 , 109–112 , 24 , 40 , 52 , 55 , 61 , 63 , 87 , 89] . 
Temperature is the dominant parameter which determines the rate 
of aging (occurring rapidly above 80 °C), as indicated in Eq. (2.1 ) 
with units of cP/day, where 1cP = 1 mPa.s [113] , and thus to prevent 
or reduce aging related reactions from taking place, FPBO must be 
stored at low temperatures [14 , 52 , 87 , 110] . An ideal storage temper- 
ature is between −5 and −10 °C where no aging occurred [40] . A 
separate study [102] stored FPBO for six months between 2 and

the end of the storage period.

e ( −9659 
Temp ) 

(2.1) 

Additionally,  the  presence  of  char,  and  speciﬁcally  the  alkali 
metals  on  the  surface  of  the  char,  such  as  potassium,  promotes 
polymerization reactions which greatly increase the rate of aging, 
so char removal improves fuel stability [56 , 111] . Aging can also be 
reduced by not only ensuring that the fuel is sealed during stor- 
age, but also only exposed to inert environments, such as nitrogen, 
rather than air [114] , though viscosity may still increase over long 
periods of time [108] . While the increase in viscosity during ag- 
ing has been correlated to the temperature and solids content of 
the fuel [110] , it is also related to the increasing average molec- 
ular weight and density of the fuel from the rising HMW water- 
insoluble fraction [89] . One study showed that the viscosity, molec- 
ular weight and water content of FPBO stored at 90 °C increased by 
115%, 66% and 1.5% in 15 hours respectively, while at 37 °C, it in- 
creased by only 70%, 40% and 0.5% after 84 days respectively [106] . 
Interestingly, aging played no effect on fuel acidity/pH level [106] . 
The rate of viscosity increase across several studies is graphically 
depicted below in Fig. 2 . Some studies have found that aging re- 
actions are fastest within the ﬁrst one to three months of storage 
and then level off afterwards, with little change occurring after six 
months  [89] ,  though  other  studies  have  shown  a  fairly  constant 
linear aging progression [110] . The differences in results between 
studies can likely be explained by differing feedstocks and/or ex- 
perimental methodologies. 

2.2.8. Solids content 

The  suspended  solids  within  FPBO  are  composed  of  organic 
char  and  also  contain,  in  part,  inorganic  ash  that  cannot  be 
burned [52 , 59 , 63 , 67 , 115] . The fuel’s solid content is typically under 
1.0 wt.% (as shown in Table 1 ) and acts as a catalyst, even at room 
temperature,  increasing  the  rate  of  fuel  aging  [24 , 52 , 67 , 70 , 110] . 
Additionally,  the  solids  content  in  FPBO  causes  clogging,  erosion 
and coke/char residue deposition. These are all problematic for the 
longevity, reliability and functionality of the nozzle/fuel injection 
system  and  combustor  [8 , 24 , 52] .  The  average  solid  particulate  is 
5–10 microns in diameter, with 50% of particulates usually being 
smaller  than  3  microns  [24 , 35 , 40] .  While  large  particles  are  re- 
moved from the fuel during the pyrolysis process using cyclones 
[65] , they  can agglomerate during storage up to  a size of  about 
200 microns, further exacerbating the problems mentioned above 
[24 , 40 , 52 , 63] . HMW compounds of FPBO also form additional solid

7 

particles as the fuel ages over time, with the rate of change in- 
creasing with the initial solids concentration in the fuel [110] . Solid 
char within the fuel presents an additional problem if it is not fully 
oxidized during combustion as it can produce hazardous pollutants 
in the form of PM emissions [52 , 71–73] . 

Fuel  ash  represents  the  incombustible  components/portion  of 
solid  particulates.  It  is  composed  of  inorganic  compounds,  such 
as  metals  and  salts,  and  contributes  to  PM  emissions,  surface 
deposits,  wear  and  corrosion;  the  latter  of  which  is  a  partic- 
ular  concern  if  the  ash  contains  chlorine,  sodium,  potassium 
or  other  reactive  molecules  in  a  high  temperature  environment 
[6 , 38 , 55 , 59 , 72 , 73 , 101 , 116] .  With  eﬃcient  FPBO  combustion  and 
good  combustor  design,  ash  should  comprise  nearly  100%  of  a 
device’s PM emissions [8] . Furthermore, the alkali metal content 
within  the  ash  was  found  to  accelerate/increase  the  formation 
of CO and UHC emissions from char particles during combustion 
[117] . 

2.2.9. Non-volatile residue 

FPBO is a mixture of over 300 components [8 , 14 , 40 , 118] with 
wide range of  molecular weights (ranges from 0.03 to  2 kg/mol 
[49] ) and boiling temperatures (up to about 650 °C [103] ). Heavier 
liquid fuels with a higher molecular weight generally have a lower 
vaporization  rate  [10] .  The  lower  molecular  weight  components, 
such as water, begin to vaporize/boil at or below 100 °C [52 , 87] . 
Above 280 °C, residues comprise the remaining non-volatile frac- 
tion,  representing  35–50  wt.%  of  the  original  FPBO  [24 , 52 , 87] . 
Other studies with higher ﬁnal distillation temperatures of 330 °C 
showed non-volatile residues as low as 25 wt.% [76] , 20 wt.% at 
600 °C [63] and 17 wt.% at 800 °C. In oxidative (air) environments, 
all solid residue was completely oxidized around 600 °C [103] . In 
comparison, light fuel oils like diesel are fully distillable [119] and 
can vaporize at about twice the speed of FPBO [24] . In essence, 
since FPBO is not fully distillable, distillation cannot be used for 
fuel upgrading as is used for fossil oils. 

The residual non-volatile residue from FPBO is responsible for 
coking  deposits,  char  formation  and  PM  emissions  if  burnout 
within the combustion region is incomplete. Solid particle burnout 
is a slow, heterogeneous process requiring longer combustion res- 
idence times and FPBO cannot therefore be used in applications 
requiring the fuel to be fully evaporated (i.e. fully distillable), such 
as premixed combustion [63] . The amount of residual char, there- 
fore, should be minimized through optimizing the fuel’s heating 
rate in a combustor. In fact, when small droplets of pyrolysis oil 
are  heated  very  quickly  ( ≥10 5  °C/min)  through  the  100–350  °C 
range,  signiﬁcantly  less  char  (only  about  one  quarter)  is  formed 
[60 , 120] .  One  potential  explanation  for  this  effect  is  that  higher 
heating rates favor molecular cracking reactions over polymeriza- 
tion reactions (the two of which are in competition) and also with 
higher  heating  rates,  less  time  is  available for  polymerization  to 
occur [60 , 121] . With smaller droplets being able to heat-up more 
rapidly, the importance of a high-quality atomization prior to com- 
bustion is evident. With proper combustor design and atomization 
generating small droplets and high heating rates, spray combustion 
studies have found that residual char or carbonaceous residue (CR) 
in the exhaust can be as low as 0.1 wt.% or less, relative to the 
initial weight of the fuel [79] . 

2.2.10. Latent heat of vaporization and vapor pressure 

While the latent heat of vaporization and vapor pressure of fos- 
sil oils are well established, limited information is available in the 
literature on the two parameters for FPBO. An estimation for the 
latent heat of vaporization of FPBO can be determined as a combi- 
nation of the heat of vaporization of water (~2257 kJ/kg) and liquid 
hydrocarbons (~300 kJ/kg) with taking into account the aqueous 
and non-aqueous portions of FPBO, respectively [24] . For example, 

FPBO’s latent heat of vaporization is reported to change from 1300 
to 400 kJ/kg with decreasing its water content from 26 to 0 wt.% 
[97] . The measured vapor pressure of a FPBO mixture is reported to 
be the same as the value of the lightest component of the mixture 
[116] . For example, the vapor pressure of FPBO at 33.5 °C is about 
5.2 kPa [85] , which is close to the vapor pressure of water at the 
same temperature. In addition to these average values, the latent 
heat of vaporization and vapor pressure of the major components 
of FPBO are reported in several studies which are important in the 
numerical modeling of FPBO spray combustion [78 , 122 , 123] . 

2.2.11. Minor elemental species 

Wood-derived  FPBO,  on  which  this  review  is  based,  con- 
tains  fuel-bound  nitrogen;  this  tends  to  dominate  the  fuel’s 
NO x  emissions  with  thermal  NO x  accounting  for  the  balance 
[6 , 8 , 24 , 35 , 63 , 116] . Fuel-NO x  emissions (from fuel-bound nitrogen) 
typically form through a similar conversion pathway to the Fen- 
imore Mechanism [124] and are therefore relatively insensitive to 
temperature. Conversely, thermal NO x are very temperature depen- 
dent and are formed comparatively slowly in the post-ﬂame region 
via the Zeldovich Mechanism [125] , but are usually reduced during 
FPBO combustion as a result of the decreased ﬂame temperature 
from the fuel’s high water content [8 , 24 , 35 , 36 , 112 , 126] . Therefore, 
to lower NO x emissions (which form smog [96] and can be a par- 
ticularly potent greenhouse gas [55] ), it is best to lower the ni- 
trogen content of the fuel [60] . Fuel nitrogen to NO x  conversion 
eﬃciency decreases with decreasing oxygen concentration assum- 
ing a constant ﬂame temperature, stabilizing above a certain point. 
In addition, fuel nitrogen conversion eﬃciency decreases with in- 
creasing fuel nitrogen content, though still increasing NO x  emis- 
sions overall [126] . NO x emissions are diﬃcult to control, but local- 
ized fuel rich combustion zones have been shown to preferentially 
convert fuel-bound nitrogen into nitrogen gas rather than into NO x 
emissions [102] . Other combustion or post-combustion based NO x 
control  strategies,  in  particular  staged  combustion,  can  be  effec- 
tive, but implementation is application speciﬁc [8 , 36 , 40 , 126 , 127] . 
Though NO x encompasses many pollutants, NO is the major con- 
stituent, accounting for up to 95% of NO x emissions in some prac- 
tical combustion applications [127] . 

FPBO tends to have little to no sulfur content and hence there 
are  negligible  SO x  emissions,  unlike  those  from  coal  and  many 
fossil oils [8 , 14 , 35 , 128 , 129] . SO x  emissions harm the environment 
through  acid  rain,  cause  corrosion  and  poison  catalysts,  such  as 
those in emission reduction devices [36 , 66 , 96 , 128] . 

Soot particles form in fuel-rich ﬂame regions as a result of gas- 
phase reactions, unlike CR, char or coke which are developed from 
FPBO’s  liquid-phase  reactions.  Soot  gives  ﬂames  high  luminosity 
(typically a yellow/orange color) which results in higher thermal 
radiation  [37] .  With  FPBO  spray  combustion,  soot  usually  repre- 
sents only a small fraction of the overall PM emissions [63 , 116] . 
This is because FPBO is highly oxygenated and has a high water 
content  which  acts  to  suppress  soot  formation  through  a  lower 
ﬂame temperature and accelerate its oxidation from the increased 
hydroxyl radical concentration [52] . 

2.3. FPBO upgrading 

FPBO has several unfavorable fuel properties compared to fossil 
oils, most notably: low energy density, high viscosity, high water 
content, suspended solid particulates, non-volatile residue, chemi- 
cal instability and an incompatibility with conventional fossil oils 
[38] . However, FPBO can be upgraded for more demanding appli- 
cations  to  improve  its  chemical  and  physical  properties,  making 
it  more  similar  to  fossil  oils  and  more  suitable  for  use  in  stan- 
dard combustion systems [51 , 130] . Physical upgrading methods in- 
volve altering speciﬁc undesirable fuel properties without the use

of  chemical  reactions  [64] .  Some  methods  include:  ﬁltering  out 
solids  through  hot  gas  or  liquid  ﬁltration,  blending  or  emulsify- 
ing  with  more  conventional  fuels  or  removing  water  using  frac- 
tional/sequential  condensation.  Chemical  upgrading  methods  are 
still in the research phase, but use catalytic conversion to create 
fuel properties more similar to standard fossil oils [118 , 129] . 

2.3.1. Physical upgrading 

Hot gas/vapor ﬁltration is used to remove additional char left 
behind after cyclonic separation and can be conducted during the 
fast  pyrolysis  process  prior  to  pyrolysis  vapor  condensation.  Cy- 
clonic separation is not very effective at removing char particles 
smaller than 10 microns in size and so hot gas ﬁltration can be 
used  as  a  supplementary  process  to  upgrade  the  pyrolysis  fuel 
[52 , 70 , 87 , 115] . Studies show that the average solid particle size af- 
ter typical cyclonic separation is about 5 microns in diameter or 
smaller, but hot gas ﬁltration can greatly reduce char amounts fur- 
ther while bringing the ash content down to below 0.01 wt.%, re- 
moving virtually all solids (including alkali metals) [9 , 85 , 111] af- 
ter which the fuel displays excellent stability [111] . Hot gas ﬁltra- 
tion  however,  does  require  the  FPBO  vapors  to  spend  additional 
residence time in a high temperature environment (with the ﬁl- 
ter heated to around 350–400 °C [115] ), leading to greater ther- 
mal  decomposition  (or  cracking)  and  a  yield  reduction  of  about 
10–20% because additional non-condensable carbon monoxide and 
hydrogen gases are formed [65 , 87 , 97] . The yield reduction makes 
production more expensive and thus could reduce its commercial 
viability if the upgraded fuel does not proportionally increase in 
value. 

Fuel ﬁltering can be useful if the solids content is high or if 
the  solid  particles  have  agglomerated  during  storage,  but  ﬁlters 
can clog rapidly [66 , 131 , 132] and even after ﬁltration, polymeriza- 
tion can form new solids within the fuel and so in-line ﬁltering 
is often recommended [56] . However, liquid ﬁltration is often un- 
successful  [87]  because  the  fuel’s  high  viscosity  presents  signiﬁ- 
cant challenges when pumping through a ﬁlter, particularly when 
conducted without heating or solvent addition. Furthermore, such 
ﬁltering reduces the fuel’s energy content and yield by uninten- 
tionally removing HMW compounds [24 , 63 , 87] . Recently, a liquid 
ﬁltration  study  was  successful  in  removing  char  and  ash  parti- 
cles greater than 1 micron while having little effect on the FPBO’s 
chemical composition or energy content. Fouling of the ﬁlter did 
occur and this process is still currently relegated to the research 
stage, but it shows promise [133] . 

To improve the combustion quality of FPBO, it is often blended 
with polar solvents such as ethanol, methanol, or butanol. The oxy- 
genated  compounds  in  FPBO  give  it  polar  properties  and  conse- 
quently it is insoluble with fossil oils, requiring emulsiﬁcation with 
the aid of surfactants to form mixtures [20 , 52 , 55 , 87 , 134] . Blending 
FPBO with alcohol stabilizes the fuel by reducing the aging rate by 
a factor of up to 18, which improves the fuel’s storability [113] . Sta- 
bilization with alcohol is most effective when blended shortly af- 
ter fuel production and when methanol is used [70 , 111 , 113] , how- 
ever methanol addition above about 10 wt.% has little added ben- 
eﬁt [135] . Blending with a solvent also helps the fuel’s homogene- 
ity  [136]  and  increases  the  resultant  heating  value  of  the  mix- 
ture [87] and its burning rate slightly [24] which correspondingly 
eases combustor residence time requirements. Furthermore, mix- 
ing FPBO with alcohol can reduce the fuel’s surface tension and 
viscosity (by up to half at 40 °C [113] ) and increase its volatility, 
all of which improve the blend’s atomization and ignition charac- 
teristics, helping to stabilize the combustion process, thereby re- 
ducing emissions [8 , 24 , 48 , 63 , 87 , 137] and expanding its operational 
range within spray combustors [102] . Alcoholic solvents can how- 
ever be costly [40] , inﬂuencing FPBO’s scalability from research to 
industry. FPBO/diesel emulsions, which can be stable even when a 

large majority of the mixture is FPBO [55] , present similar combus- 
tion beneﬁts (with respect to viscosity, aging/stability, atomization 
and ignition) and cost disadvantages [48 , 138] . Emulsion properties 
are dependent upon the size and dispersion of the FPBO droplets 
within the fossil oil or vice versa [9 , 138] . 

Reducing the high water content of FPBO improves its energy 
density, but boiling the water out of the fuel, which is generally 
done at high temperatures during distillation, causes the fuel to 
age rapidly [107] and also can unintentionally remove some of the 
useful energy containing components [105 , 139] . Instead, vacuum or 
reduced pressure distillation can be used to boil the fuel or vapor- 
ize certain components at reduced temperatures. A similar method 
can  also  be  used  to  remove  some  of  the  LMW  molecules  (e.g., 
LMW acids, aldehydes, and ketones) that contribute to the aging 
process. By removing these compounds with the water, the fuel’s 
energy  density  and  stability  can  be  mutually  improved  [140] .  In 
one experiment [141] , the water content was reduced to 0.01 wt.% 
with a 61% fuel yield (from the original FPBO) using reduced pres- 
sure distillation. The oxygen content was also simultaneously re- 
duced  by  about  80%,  doubling  the  resultant  fuel’s  heating  value 
while reducing acidity to an almost neutral pH and drastically in- 
creasing storage stability. As the water content of the FPBO is re- 
duced, its viscosity increases substantially and so a solvent, such as 
methanol or ethanol, would almost certainly be required for ade- 
quate atomization, pumping and combustion. Effective, large-scale 
fuel distillation processes have yet to be demonstrated [105 , 139] . 
Instead, a more practical way to remove water from the fuel and 
increase  its  heating  value  and  stability  on  an  industrial  scale  is 
by using fractional/sequential condensation during fuel production 
[142] . 

2.3.2. Chemical upgrading 

The primary chemical upgrading methods are catalytic cracking 
and hydrotreating (or hydrodeoxygenation) [118] . Both methods act 
to deoxygenate the fuel and break down the HMW compounds to 
produce a biofuel with properties similar to that of typical trans- 
portation grade fuels, though subsequent reﬁning through standard 
petroleum infrastructure is required [21 , 64 , 118 , 129] . Both of these 
methods use a catalyst which has so far become rapidly deacti- 
vated during testing, requiring frequent maintenance and therefore 
research is still ongoing [22 , 38 , 129] . Other strategies such as ester- 
iﬁcation and acetalization are also extensively studied to improve 
FPBO properties [51 , 143–145] . 

Catalytic cracking produces a chemically upgraded fuel at high 
temperatures (about 450 °C, but can vary) and atmospheric pres- 
sure,  but  reduces  the  maximum  yield  to  only  about  30%  of  the 
initial FPBO. This process deoxygenates the fuel and produces by- 
products of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and water while the 
remaining hydrogen and carbon are formed into a chemically up- 
graded  fuel  in  the  gasoline  range.  The  resulting  fuel  is  of  com- 
paratively poorer quality than when hydrotreated, but the process 
involved  is  simpler  and  therefore  cheaper  than  the  alternatives 
[21 , 38 , 118 , 129] . 

Hydrotreating  is  considered  to  be  a  more  viable  option  than 
catalytic cracking since hydrotreated fuel has a much lower ﬁnal 
oxygen content (below 5 wt.%), a higher ﬁnal heating value (more 
than  twice  that  of  the  original  biofuel)  and  a  resulting  yield  of 
up to 65% of the initial FPBO since no carbon is removed [118] . 
This process also improves ignition characteristics, reduces acidity, 
provides enhanced thermal stability and signiﬁcantly reduces the 
fuel’s water content and viscosity which are important for FPBO 
atomization and combustion [26 , 112 , 118] . For hydrotreating, a cat- 
alyst is used in a high temperature (up to 450 °C), high pressure 
(up to 200 bar) and hydrogen rich environment. Unfortunately, re- 
quiring an external hydrogen source and a high pressure environ- 
ment increase the complexity and cost of this upgrading method

[112 , 118] . The hydrogen acts to deoxygenate the fuel through the 
formation of water while upgrading its chemical structure  [118] . 
The resulting fuel is in the diesel range. This process has also been 
used to reduce the nitrogen content of the fuel, through the for- 
mation of ammonia, which can reduce NO x emissions [129] . 

The above-mentioned chemical upgrading methods require ad- 
ditional fuel  processing, increased capital expenditure  and result 
in a reduction of the fuel yield, all of which act to increase the 
cost of the biofuel which is just currently approaching economic 
viability in its crude state [35] . Additional processing also requires 
a higher energy input, which can increase the fuel’s lifecycle net 
carbon emissions and ultimately detracting from one of the main 
advantages of FPBO, its carbon-neutrality. 

3. Applications and challenges 

3.1. Burners, boilers, and furnaces 

FPBO  is  currently  being  burned  in  an  increasing  number  of 
burners, boilers, and furnaces for heat and power generation. These 
types of devices are generally less sensitive to atomization, fuel/air 
mixing, and combustion characteristics due to their long residence 
times and versatile designs which are capable of operating on a 
variety of fuels, including those of lower quality containing solids. 
In fact, they are mostly designed to work with heavier fuel grades 
when  output  is  greater  than  1  MW  [24] ,  which  is  more  in  line 
with the properties of FPBO than the distillable fuels often used 
with  gas  turbine  and  compression-ignition  engines.  A  schematic 
diagram of a research burner/combustor is shown in Fig. 3 . 

Testing has been conducted on these applications, ranging from 
10 kW to beyond 10 MW [147] , and results have shown that FPBO 
combusts  well  in  conventional  oil  burners,  boilers,  and  furnaces 
(though some modiﬁcations are often required [136] ). In these ap- 
plications, FPBO can even provide a similar or greater eﬃciency as 
compared to light fuel oils like number 2 [148] . However, a sepa- 
rate study found that FPBO burns slower and with a larger ﬂame at 
a given power input, providing a lower heat release per unit vol- 
ume and thus a lower power output if switching a conventional

oil  burner  to  FPBO  [136] .  Emissions  from  stable  FPBO  combus- 
tion were within acceptable limits when running solely on FPBO 
with  only  minor  modiﬁcations  to  the  burner,  though  PM  emis- 
sions were high from the fuel’s solids and ash content (depend- 
ing on the fuel), poor atomization, and polymerization [24 , 38 , 108] . 
Table 2 illustrates typical emissions from FPBO in burners, boilers, 
and furnaces, which often fall between light and heavy fuel oils 
[63 , 131 , 147 , 149] . 

Among all the above-mentioned applications, since boilers are 
required to cycle on and off during regular use, necessitating rapid 
heat-ups  and  cool-downs,  FPBO  faces  additional  implementation 
challenges for them. Continuous cycling could exacerbate fuel re- 
lated issues, and the need to ﬂush the fuel and injection systems 
during  shut-down  along  with  the  use  of  secondary  fuels  during 
start-up signiﬁcantly lengthens these processes, which would re- 
quire  additional  accommodation  [24 , 40 , 149] .  On  the  other  hand, 
FPBO’s bright yellow/orange ﬂame (from PM) provides substantial 
radiative heat transfer which is ideal for boilers and similar appli- 
cations [52 , 64] , though carbon and ash surface deposits from the 
fuel can also form a shield, blocking the radiation. In these applica- 
tions, strong swirling/recirculating ﬂows (giving more compact and 
intense ﬂames), symmetric ﬂames, and higher combustion power 
were all shown to enhance combustion [92 , 136] . An additional ap- 
plication  for  FPBO  is  in  lime  kilns,  used  by  the  Pulp  and  Paper 
and  Cement  Industries.  One  study  on  a  pilot-scale  lime  kiln  re- 
ported that, FPBO was a viable alternative to natural gas for use

in lime kilns because of their equal thermal performance (heat re- 
lease and temperature proﬁle) and ultimate product quality. Fur- 
thermore, the study found that the fuels generated similar emis- 
sions and formed a similar ﬂame shape, color and size [150] . 

Regarding  large-scale  combustors,  one  of  the  ﬁrst  complete, 
commercially  viable,  FPBO  district  heating  plants  was  recently 
commissioned with a 10 MW capacity using no support fuel [35] . 
The plant produces emissions of less than 8 ppm of CO, has sta- 
ble combustion, and shows no formation of coke/char deposits on 
hot surfaces. Most recently, one study [5] measured the exhaust 
emissions  of  the  Fortum  Vermo  district  heating  plant  located  in 
Finland, in which a 49 MW water tube boiler unit was modiﬁed 
to  use  FPBO.  The  plant  was  equipped  with  an  electrostatic  pre- 
cipitator  to  remove  particles  from  the  ﬂue  gases.  They  reported 
that although the FPBO combustion emissions were characterized 
by  higher  total  suspended  PM  and  ﬁne  PM  concentrations  than 
heavy fossil oil-ﬁred boilers, FPBO combustion emitted less of sev- 
eral health-hazardous emission components such as polycyclic aro- 
matic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy metals. However, they stated 
that due to the relatively high PM formation in FPBO combustion, 
the conversion of small fossil oil boiler plants to operate on FPBO 
would in most cases require additional particle ﬁltration systems 
to fulﬁl the Finland national emission regulations and EU regula- 
tions. 

The  combustion  quality  within  and  emissions 

from 
intermediate-sized combustors (100 kW to 1 MW [149] ) are more 
sensitive to the FPBO water content, solids content, and viscosity 
than their larger counterparts. One of the main issues is the PM 
in the exhaust, likely due to an insuﬃcient char burnout/residence 
time  [131] .  One  study  [6]  showed  that  a  properly  designed 
100  kW  spray  burner  could  operate  under  steady-state  condi- 
tions  on  FPBO  at  virtually  complete  combustion  (CO  levels  at 
0.35  ppm)  with  low  ash  deposition.  However,  under  transient 
conditions  and  sub-optimal  air-to-fuel  ratios,  the  combustion 
quality of the same burner rapidly degraded, resulting in CO emis- 
sions  of  approximately  10 0 0  ppm.  This  shows  the  sensitivity  of 
intermediately-sized FPBO combustion systems to their operating 
parameters. Another study [151] , using a 100 kW insulated burner 
with an externally mixed twin-ﬂuid nozzle, found that low equiv- 
alence ratios between 0.46 and 0.68 (or high excess air) generated 
better  combustion,  higher  temperatures  and  lower  CO  and  UHC 
emissions (alongside higher NO x  emissions), though CO and UHC 
levels  were  still  above  those  produced  from  diesel  ﬂames.  One 
ﬁnal study to highlight [39] burned FPBO in a refractory-lined in- 
termediate burner (20 0–50 0 kW), intended for use with light fuel 
oils,  and  found  no  major  problems,  though  long-term  durability 
remains in question. The burner used simple pressure atomization 
which  required  higher  pressures  than  with  fossil  oil  because  of 
the higher FPBO viscosity, leading to some droplet blow-through 
and  increased  PM  emissions.  Nonetheless,  the  study  concluded 
that this atomization method and intermediate-class systems are 
ﬁne  for  use  with  good  quality  FPBO  with  producing  acceptable 
levels  of  emissions  when  combustion  conditions  are  adequately 
optimized and some parts of the combustion system are modiﬁed 
[39] . They observed that low-water FPBO (under 24%) produced a 
stable ﬂame in a 200 kW boiler, while higher-water FPBO (30%) 
could not be cleanly combusted until being placed in a 500 kW 
boiler, likely due to better fuel/air mixing. 

Small-scale  burners  further  exacerbate  the  spray  combustion 
problems existing in intermediate-sized systems because of lower 
residence times and greater heat losses. In these smaller applica- 
tions, proper atomization and fuel/air mixing are even more criti- 
cal, and the fuel viscosity is suggested to be on the low end of the 
recommended range (4–25cSt (mm 2 /s)) [40] . One study [61] , eval- 
uating hot gas ﬁltered FPBO in a 5 kW combustor, recommended 
the use of air-blast atomizers for viscous fuels based on the work 

done by Lefebvre [58] , and determined that internally mixed twin- 
ﬂuid nozzles were much more effective than their externally mixed 
counterparts. They [61] noted that the FPBO ﬂame was typically 
seated on the internally mixed nozzle and that a recirculating ﬂow 
(from  primary  air  swirl)  resulted  in  the  lowest  emissions.  Since 
FPBO  burns  at  a  low  stoichiometric  air-to-fuel  ratio,  the  study 
found it diﬃcult to avoid running too lean when providing enough 
primary air for swirl/recirculation along with enough atomizing air 
for a ﬁne spray with proper penetration. Furthermore, the addition 
of 10% ethanol to the FPBO improved combustion performance and 
ﬂame stability [61] . 

One study [92] compared the ﬂame structures and emissions 
using  a  pressure  and  a  twin-ﬂuid  atomizer  when  operating  on 
FPBO  in  a  19  kW,  refractory-lined,  combustor.  Strong  swirl  and 
both  primary/combustion  air  and  fuel  preheating  were  required 
to achieve stable ignition and combustion for both nozzles, with 
the ﬂame from the twin-ﬂuid nozzle being more stable due to its 
ﬁner spray, producing lower emissions. Twin-ﬂuid atomization also 
produced FPBO ﬂames of lower luminosity due to lower amounts 
of particulate matter, partially as a result of the nozzle’s greater 
spray dispersion which reduced FPBO agglomeration and thereby 
PM emissions as well. In essence, spray dispersion is the ratio of 
the spray volume to the volume of liquid contained within it, and 
a  high  degree  of  spray  dispersion  allows  for  good  fuel/air  mix- 
ing which helps to promote evaporation, eﬃcient combustion and 
lower  emissions  [40 , 58] .  Furthermore,  at  lean  conditions,  it  was 
found that PM emissions of FPBO were dominated by CR rather 
than soot. Using twin-ﬂuid atomization and lean combustion, UHC, 
CO, NO x and PM emissions were all quite low and similar to light 
fuel oil. Additionally, CO, UHC and PM emissions all decreased with 
increasing atomizing airﬂow due to an increased spray dispersion 
and a lower spray droplet size, all being near zero at high atomiz- 
ing airﬂow rates. Comparatively, light fuel oil had consistently low 
emissions with little dependence on the airﬂow rate, likely due to 
its superior atomization and fuel/air mixing. Low atomizing airﬂow 
rates generated shorter and brighter (yellow) ﬂames, indicating PM 
from  poor  fuel/air  mixing,  while  increasing  airﬂows  lengthened 
the ﬂame and reduced its luminosity (from reduced PM), width, 
and emissions. Compact ﬂames gave faster combustion rates, re- 
ducing hot-zone residence times and CR burnout, which increased 
PM emissions. Finally, increasing FPBO water content made igni- 
tion  more  diﬃcult  and  reduced  ﬂame  stability,  but  water,  along 
with combustion air preheat temperature, had little effect on the 
emissions or ﬂame structure. 

Flame tests in a small-scale (10 kW), uninsulated, swirl burner 
found  that  100%  FPBO  had  unstable  combustion  and  the  ﬂame 
lift-off increased  as  the  ethanol  content  decreased  due  to  lower 
fuel volatility and a narrower ﬂammability range [117] . Therefore, 
it  was  concluded  that  blending  with  at  least  10%  ethanol  was 
required  to  form  a  stable  FPBO  ﬂame  with  adequate  emissions, 
which  was  conﬁrmed  by  a  second  study  in  a  35  kW,  insulated, 
burner [137] . In this second study, 100% FPBO had CO emissions 
above 10 0 0 ppm, but with the addition of 10% ethanol, CO emis- 
sions were reduced to about 1 ppm. The ﬁrst study also suggested 
that the majority of CO and UHC emissions were formed during 
char burnout, beyond the ﬂame region where temperatures were 
too low for further oxidation, and that the alkali metal content of 
the ash particles accelerated the formation of CO and UHC emis- 
sions  from  char  particles.  Char  residues  and  PM  emissions  were 
most strongly correlated to residues formed during thermogravi- 
metric (TG) analysis from HMW components, allowing this test to 
be used as a predictive measure for relative emissions in smaller 
scale burners where residence times are insuﬃcient for complete 
burnout. Furthermore, increases in the fuel’s ash and solids content 
led to higher CO, UHC and PM emissions [117] .

Another set of experiments [63 , 71 , 102 , 119] in a 10 kW, uninsu- 
lated, swirl burner using a 80/20 vol% FPBO/ethanol blend found 
that  the  effect  of  swirl  on  PM  emissions  was  greater  than  that 
from  the  atomizing  air.  The  amounts  of  atomizing  and  primary 
air used to increase the turbulent mixing, atomization quality and 
combustion eﬃciency were constrained by higher spray jet speeds 
that reduced the combustion zone residence time, by lean blow- 
out from ﬂame shear, and by the fuel’s limited volatility. Preheat- 
ing the primary air and fuel lowered the UHC and CO emissions, 
but had a minimal effect on the PM emissions, which were mostly 
comprised of ash. Increasing the pilot ﬂame energy lowered the 
CO emissions, reducing the effects of poor ignition, but it had no 
real effect on the PM or UHC emissions. Diesel outperformed the 
FPBO blend at all operating conditions with respect to emissions, 
but both fuels had similar ﬂame temperatures. Number 4 fuel oil, 
which is not fully distillable and contains ash and nitrogen, was 
subsequently compared to both diesel and the FPBO blend, ﬁnd- 
ing that the heavy fuel oil’s CO and UHC emissions generally fell 
in-between  the  other  fuels,  but  were  closer  to  diesel.  PM  emis- 
sions  from  the  heavy  fuel  oil  were  higher  than  FPBO  despite  a 
lower non-volatile fraction, suggesting that it forms a more diﬃ- 
cult residue to burn or possibly the lower ash content of the fuel 
lowered  burnout  rates  compared  to  FPBO.  NO x  emissions  of  the 
number 4 fuel fell about half way between the other two. Prelimi- 
nary testing revealed that stable combustion could not be achieved 
with a solid-cone spray, even with ethanol blending at 50 vol%. Al- 
ternatively, hollow-cone sprays generated a stable ﬂame with re- 
duced UHC emissions by strengthening the combustor’s central re- 
circulation zone. 

Emissions from 100% FPBO in a 10 kW, double-insulated, fur- 
nace were far below the acceptable limits for a small-scale com- 
bustion system [4 , 146] . The loaded PM ﬁlters collected from the 
furnace (see Fig. 4 ) were analyzed gravimetrically, and PM emis- 
sions were found to be about 90% ash and 10% CR while at the 
combustor’s optimal operating conditions. Similarly, CO and UHC 
emissions were below their detectable thresholds of 10 ppm and 
3 ppm respectively, but had a strong temperature dependence dur- 
ing transient operation (decreasing emissions with increasing fur- 
nace temperature). 

Higher swirl resulted in increased coking and higher fuel tem- 
peratures at the nozzle tip because of increased recirculation, but 
the FPBO ﬂame was very sensitive to the amount of primary air 
swirl  and  if  it  was  too  low,  ﬂame  instabilities  would  form  and 
could  have  led  to  extinguishment.  Once  steady-state  conditions 
were  reached,  the  primary  fuel/air  heater  could  be  lowered  or

turned off, having no effect on CO or UHC emissions, indicating 
that the insulative lining was effective at maintaining the internal 
combustor temperature and preventing heat losses. However, low 
primary air preheating temperatures increased nozzle coking when 
below 88 °C, worsening as the air temperature decreased further. 
It was observed that, over time, the coking on the nozzle would 
build up (see Fig. 5 ) and could interfere with atomization, increas- 
ing emissions. 

Another study [69 , 152] conducted on 100% FPBO in a 10 kW, 
double-insulated, furnace continued to show the potential of the 
biofuel. Using a partially optimized, internally mixed air-blast noz- 
zle, a successful "cold-start" on FPBO was conducted with only a 
1 kW fuel-air heater and a 0.3 kW methane/oxygen pilot ﬂame. 
No  secondary  fuel  was  used  to  warm-up  the  combustion  cham- 
ber.  During  the  cold-start,  the  fuel  immediately  ignited  and  the 
ﬂame stabilized within 15 seconds. In addition, nozzle coking was 
normal, presenting no problems, and the system’s transient heat- 
up proﬁle was very similar to when ethanol was used as a start- 
ing fuel. During steady-state operation, the same nozzle was also 
able to form a stably seated FPBO ﬂame without the use of a pilot 
ﬂame. Under these conditions, CO emissions were not measurable 
(below  8  ppm)  and  NO  emissions  were  below  100  ppm.  Nozzle 
coking and the atomizing air range in which a stably seated ﬂame 
could  exist  were  unaffected  by  the  removal  of  the  pilot  ﬂame. 
Hence, secondary fuels were only required in the form of a small 
pilot  ﬂame  during  initial  start-up  which  is  important  to  reduce 
costs on an industrial scale. Given the small-scale of this combus- 
tor, results should be comparable or better in a larger system since 
fractional heat losses would be reduced and residence times would 
be increased. 

In  summary,  FPBO-fueled  burners,  boilers,  and  furnaces  are 
ready  from  a  technical  perspective  for  large-scale  industrial  use, 
and even small-scale systems show excellent ﬂame stability, low 
emissions, and minimal requirements for secondary fuel usage. The 
combustion  challenges  associated  with  these  applications  result 
from [24 , 38 , 149 , 151 , 152] : 

• high viscosity causing poor atomization 
• poor ignition and ﬂame stability due to poor volatility, water 

content, and HMW components 

• clogging and coking from polymerization and/or fuel solids 
• corrosion 
• PM, emissions, and deposits 

3.2. Gas turbine engines 

A number of experimental studies have been reported on at- 
tempting FPBO in gas turbine engines used for generating power 
or  combined  heat  and  power  (CHP),  see  Fig.  6 .  With  respect  to 
engines,  there  are  two  types  of  gas  turbine  combustors:  annu- 
lar combustors and can combustors [153] . Annular combustors as 
usually  seen  in  aero  and  aero-derivative  engines  offer  compact- 
ness and low pressure losses due to heat addition, whereas can- 
type combustors are commonly installed in heavy-duty frame en- 
gines as modules and can be easily retroﬁtted to offer longer res- 
idence times for fuel burnout and larger ﬂow passages for resis- 
tance against clogging. 

Gas  turbines  are  commonly  equipped  with  pressure-swirl  or 
air-blast atomizers [154] , and typically run on light fuel oils, such 
as kerosene or diesel [24 , 38 , 155] , but it is believed that with mod- 
iﬁcations, they could operate successfully on FPBO [38] . Gas tur- 
bines feature continuous fuel injection and combustion which is 
beneﬁcial for FPBO usage as compared to the cyclic operation of 
boilers ( Section 3.1 ) and the intermittency of compression-ignition 
engines ( Section 3.3 ). However, gas turbines running on FPBO can 
suffer from ﬂame instability, inadequate fuel residence times, and

incomplete combustion, leading to an increase in PM and gaseous 
emissions and coke/char residue deposition [9 , 10 , 33 , 156] . Regard- 
less of hot-zone residence time, ash will be present in the exhaust 
and mineral residues will need to be managed to prevent the ero- 
sions  of  high-speed  turbomachinery  blades  [10 , 40] .  Furthermore, 
the PM acts as a black-body radiator, enhancing the undesirable 
radiation heat transfer to combustor liners, which may overstress 
these hot-gas path components thermally [154] . As such, facilitat- 
ing the use of FPBO in turbine engines generally necessitates sys- 
tem modiﬁcations and regular maintenance, so “silo” type combus- 
tors are advantageous because of their higher adaptability and eas- 
ier access [9 , 96 , 157] . 

The development of an Orenda Aerospace OGT2500 2.5 MW gas 
turbine for use with alternative fuels, including FPBO, was initiated 
in  1995,  as  reported  in  several  publications  [33 , 96 , 100 , 101 , 158] . 
The base-model GT-2500 engine designed and built by Mashproekt 
in  the  Ukraine  was  retroﬁtted  with  corrosion  resistant  materials 
(300 series stainless steel and high-density polyethylene), protec- 
tive surface coatings, a fuel preheating system and an externally 
mixed twin-ﬂuid nozzle for better atomization. Components that 
were deemed to have high corrosion risks (including the nozzles 
and  turbine  blades)  exposing  to  FPBO  were  tested  for  durability 
for over 10 0 0 hours in a furnace mimicking gas turbine combus- 
tor conditions. Post-test examinations of the components revealed 
minor  corrosions,  attributed  to  the  intensity  of  the  experiment. 
To initiate combustion, the engine was started on diesel fuel and 
then switched over to preheated FPBO (60–90 °C) and after op- 
eration, the fuel lines were ﬂushed and cleaned with ethanol. The 
on-line hot-section cleaning system, utilizing an abrasive ﬂuid with 
crushed nutshells, also successfully removed built-up debris while

the turbine was operating between idle and full power. In one test, 
the turbine operated for a total of 55 hours on 100% FPBO showing 
stable operation, a good turndown ratio and quick stabilization af- 
ter rapid load changes. In addition, all emissions were within gov- 
ernment regulations in the province of Ontario, Canada at the time 
of testing. FPBO had higher CO emissions, but lower NO x and SO x 
emissions,  compared  to  diesel  fuel  operation  [9 , 33 , 100 , 101 , 158] . 
Table 3 shows the FPBO combustion emissions as compared to sev- 
eral other fuels, along with the government emission regulations. 
Emission trends matched other gas turbine studies [157] . Further- 
more, PM emissions were higher than during diesel operation as a 
result of residence time restrictions [96] , but no component dam- 
age was found after operation of the turbine on 100% FPBO [24 , 96] . 
One  study  [159]  combusted  unﬁltered  FPBO  in  a  40  kW  gas 
turbine with 200 °C preheated combustion air and an internally 
mixed twin-ﬂuid nozzle. The fuel was heated to 85 °C and stirred 
in its storage tank without observing fuel polymerization. The gas 
turbine was started on ethanol (in this study ethanol referred to

a mix of 95% ethanol and 5% water) with a pilot ﬂame and when 
the engine was hot enough, the fuel was switched to FPBO and the 
pilot ﬂame was deactivated. Further testing found that with pre- 
heated combustion air above 80 °C, direct FPBO start-up was possi- 
ble without a pilot ﬂame. During operation, periodic ethanol ﬂush- 
ing was used to remove deposits, as well as using it at shutdown 
to ﬂush the system and prevent nozzle clogging which occurred 
rapidly if the ﬂame extinguished. Crude FPBO had good combus- 
tion quality with fuel preheat temperature, nozzle-exit diameter, 
and spray angle all proving to be important parameters. In addi- 
tion, emissions were high due to the small size of the combustor, 
but several nozzle and operational characteristics helped to opti- 
mize combustion. Smaller nozzle-exit diameters (increased atom- 
ization  energy)  improved  atomization,  CO  and  smoke  emissions, 
and  combustion  eﬃciency.  Smaller  spray  angles  created  a  more 
compact ﬂame with limited hot-zone residence time while larger 
spray angles resulted in wall impingement, with a 60 ° spray angle 
as a good compromise. Higher exhaust temperatures were strongly 
correlated with improved combustion performance, reducing both 
PM  and  especially  CO  emissions,  but  increasing  NO x  formation. 
As well, even small amounts of fuel ethanol blending greatly im- 
proved  combustion  eﬃciency  with  respect  to  CO  emissions  and 
kept PM low. FPBO generated more NO x than kerosene, even with 
larger spray droplets and a reduced ﬂame temperature, due to fuel 
nitrogen content,  and higher amounts of FPBO in mixtures with 
ethanol increased both NO x and CO emissions. The smaller nozzle- 
exits did not cause any problems, but some deposits were found 
on the combustion chamber walls due to spray impingement and 
the incomplete combustion of large droplets. Overall, the internally 
mixed twin-ﬂuid nozzle had good atomization quality and at all 
operating points, the FPBO had stable combustion without the use 
of  a  pilot  ﬂame.  The  study  concluded  by  theorizing  that  an  in- 
creased combustion chamber pressure would increase combustion 
eﬃciency at a constant thermal load because of a corresponding 
increase in residence time  within the primary combustion  zone, 
which would in turn improve emissions. 

In another experiment [62] , it was attempted to combine the 
beneﬁts of preheating (to 80 °C) and blending FPBO with ethanol 
(20% by volume) to form a spray droplet size and spray angle simi- 
lar to that of the turbine engine’s original fuel, JP-4. No pilot ﬂame 
was  used,  instead  ignition  was  achieved  with  a  spark  plug  and 
the turbine was started with JP-4. At nominal engine loading, the 
FPBO blend and JP-4 fuels had comparable combustion eﬃciencies, 
CO levels and NO x emissions, but at other operating points, above 
and below, the turbine showed degraded performance while op- 
erating on the FPBO blend as evidenced by comparatively lower 
ﬂame temperatures and much larger CO emissions. In addition to 
the FPBO blend displaying a narrower range of eﬃcient operation, 
it was also prone to combustion instabilities at low frequencies. A 
potential explanation for the FPBO blend’s poorer performance at 
higher loading conditions is the large fuel ﬂow rates required be- 
cause of the fuel’s lower energy content. If at these conditions the 
fuel/air mixing was not suﬃcient, local fuel rich zones would have 
formed and combustion eﬃciency would  have decreased, poten- 
tially reducing NO x emissions as well [36 , 37 , 62] . 

Another study [60] found that at high load conditions (above 
70%  of  the  full  load),  100%  FPBO  can  be  burned  in  a  gas  tur- 
bine without blending with ethanol. However, at low partial loads, 
ethanol  blending  was  required  to  prevent  the  fuel  spray  from 
impinging  on  combustor  liner  due  to  poor  atomization  and  low 
droplet  burning  rate  at  low  ﬂame  temperatures.  Tests  were  also 
performed with FPBO, preheated to 50 °C, to ﬁnd sensitivities to 
nozzle types, although ﬂame stabilization can be achieved with ei- 
ther pressure or air-blast atomizers. While pressure atomization re- 
sulted in less ideal sprays that produced visible sparks from fuel 
residue  and  formed  deposits  within  the  combustor,  air-blast  at- 

omization was superior, producing a nearly seated yellow ﬂame, 
without combustor deposits and with high combustion eﬃciency. 
With respect to emissions, FPBO formed more CO, but equal NO x 
as compared to diesel operation. The authors also noted that this 
experiment was performed in a scaled-combustor at atmospheric 
conditions,  but  the  increased  pressure  in  an  actual  gas  turbine 
would have enhanced the air-blast atomization further, giving bet- 
ter ﬂame stability, lower CO emissions and higher NO x emissions. 
In one experiments [156] , using pressure-swirl atomization, py- 
rolysis oil and vegetable oil were burned in a micro gas turbine, 
indicating that that combustion quality degraded rapidly (higher 
CO  emissions)  with  increasing  viscosity  because  of  delayed  liga- 
ment breakup, leading to a poorer spray quality. They also found 
that  the  spray  droplet  size  formed  during  primary  atomization 
was insensitive to ﬂuid viscosity when it is under 10 cP (mPa • s), 
with higher emissions linked to increasing breakup length. To im- 
prove the spray quality and make the breakup length less sensitive 
to viscosity, they recommended the use of twin-ﬂuid atomization 
with FPBO [93] . The same group co-ﬁred pyrolysis oil with diesel 
and reported that the CO level was generally slightly higher in re- 
lation to diesel, while NO emissions were in the range of few ppm 
and almost not detectable with common gas analyzing equipment 
[160] . 

More  recently,  a  set  of  experiments  [98]  studied  the  use  of 
FPBO in a small scale non-regenerated micro gas turbine. The gas 
turbine test rig in their study was a reverse ﬂow silo combustion 
chamber equipped with a single, pressure swirl duplex nozzle. It 
was then developed with several new components that replaced 
the original ones: a new re-designed (larger) combustor, two pilot 
ﬂames for starting up and shutting down, a new control system, 
and a new injection line based on a tri-fuel system. They reported 
that  employing  these  modiﬁcations  and  FPBO/ethanol  blend  as 
fuel, the engine reached an overall electrical eﬃciency higher than 
that measured with benchmark diesel fuel. Their tests with 20/80% 
and 50/50% (volume fractions) of FPBO/ethanol blends showed suc- 
cessfully and stable engine operation. In addition, by increasing the 
FPBO volume fraction in the fuel blend, an increase in CO emis- 
sions  was  observed,  likely  due  to  the  larger  droplets  generated 
from the more viscous fuel, as well as in NOx emissions, probably 
due to fuel nitrogen content. Over a long-term operation, coking 
on the pressure swirl nozzle was observed (see Fig. 7 ), and they re- 
ported that further modiﬁcations on the fuel nozzle and air distri- 
bution along the combustor would be required to achieve a stable 
combustion with 100% FPBO without the support of pilot injectors. 
In summary, while industrial scale gas turbines have been de- 
veloped to run on FPBO and there exists some tests on small-scale 
gas turbines, long term operation has not been reported yet due 
to the challenges associated with the spray combustion of FPBO in 
these engines; such as [10 , 24 , 38 , 40 , 154] :

3.3. Compression-ignition engines 

Compression-ignition engines (known as diesel engines, see Fig. 
8 )  can  be  designed  for  power  generation  or  transportation  en- 
gines, while the latter is typically much smaller in size. Medium 
speed and slow (large) diesel engines have greater fuel ﬂexibility 
and have been previously operated successfully on low grade fuels, 
making them good candidates for use with FPBO [24 , 38 , 161 , 162] , 
while smaller, transportation grade diesel engines would likely re- 
quire  signiﬁcant  fuel  upgrading  before  use  [66] .  The  beneﬁts  of 
diesel power generation are that it offers portable power solutions 
which  is  particularly  useful  for  FPBO  since  the  feedstock  would 
likely need to be harvested in remote locations. 

With  respect  to  engines,  there  are  two  main  types:  gasoline 
spark ignition and diesel compression-ignition. FPBO will not work 
with the Otto cycle found in spark ignition engines since this re- 
quires rapid vaporization and air premixing prior to ignition which 
would likely be unsuccessful with this biofuel [66] . Furthermore, 
diesel engines offer far greater eﬃciencies than spark ignition en- 
gines and similar eﬃciencies can be achieved when operated on 
FPBO or diesel fuel [33 , 38 , 132 , 164] , with one FPBO test achieving a 
thermal eﬃciency as high as 44.9% when running at 432 kW [132] . 
Long-term projections show that diesel engines operating on FPBO 
have the best potential to generate proﬁtable electricity [48] , but 
their  intermittent  injection  and  combustion,  coupled  with  short 
residence times, presents a major challenge [9] .  The combustion 
of FPBO within a diesel engine has been found to be kinetically 
limited through its combustion chemistry rather than mixing con- 
trolled like when operating with diesel fuel, so high temperatures 
are needed to increase the speed of chemical reactions [38 , 47 , 164] . 
In essence, during combustion, FPBO has a lower peak combustion 
temperature due to its lower heating value and water content [26] . 
As in any spray combustion application, atomization in diesel 
engines  is  very  important.  Diesel  engines  typically  use  simple 
pressure  atomization  and  for  these  sprays,  injector  performance 
depends  most  importantly  on  viscosity  [66] .  The  recommended 
maximum  FPBO  viscosity  when  used  in  a  diesel  engine  is  10–
20cSt  [25 , 33] .  Conventional  spray  theory  suggests  that  a  higher 
fuel viscosity produces larger droplets that would then penetrate 
deeper  into  the  combustion  cylinder,  increasing  the  probability 

that droplets will hit the walls and negatively affect combustion 
[66] .  Interestingly,  one  study  [39]  found  that  when  FPBO  was 
sprayed within a diesel engine, it had a shorter breakup length and 
a smaller spray cone angle than diesel fuel with good overall atom- 
ization, comparable to diesel, through both a one and a four hole 
injector. However, this test was conducted for less than 30 min- 
utes and some longer duration tests discussed in this section did 
not fare so well. To allow for longer continuous operation, experi- 
ments on a 29 kW engine required FPBO to be blended with 40% 
ethanol and contain less than 7% water in order to reduce carbon 
deposits to prevent build-up and subsequent damage [66] . 

Fuel injection system, a critical component of a diesel engine, 
can be vulnerable for FPBO. Injector degradation has been corre- 
lated with large increase in PM  emissions [66] , probably due to 
degraded atomization. The fuel’s lower heating value necessitates 
a greater fuel ﬂow rate and/or longer injection times, likely requir- 
ing injection system and nozzle modiﬁcations [103 , 165] . In fact, a 
higher injection ﬂow rate should be accompanied by a higher in- 
jection pressure in diesel pressure atomization systems in order to 
reduce spray droplet size and improve ignition quality [165] . Un- 
fortunately, attempts to improve combustion by varying injection 
timing were unsuccessful, showing no beneﬁt [26] . In fact, if injec- 
tion was too early, the fuel was shown to impinge on the cylinder 
wall, causing combustion quenching and severe operational prob- 
lems, such as heavy coking [26] . Both the clogging and coking be- 
havior of FPBO are a result of its tendency to polymerize at ele- 
vated temperatures while clogging can also be from the fuel’s solid 
particulates, affecting the injection system and other combustion 
cylinder components. 

For  diesel  engines,  ignition  is  an  important  property  because 
the  time  for  combustion  is  very  short,  on  the  order  of  mil- 
liseconds.  Comparing diesel fuel,  FPBO’s  cetane number is  lower 
and  ignition  quality  is  poorer  due  to  its  high  water  content, 
HMW  components  (with  low  volatility),  high  viscosity  (atomiza- 
tion),  and  slow  chemistry  (kinetically  limited  combustion  com- 
pared to mixing controlled combustion of diesel); all contributing 
to  delayed  ignition,  incomplete  combustion,  and  high  emissions 
[38 , 66 , 97 , 164 , 166] . Water content in FPBO lowers temperature in 
the combustion chamber, extending ignition delay times, and mod- 
erating the fuel’s burning rate [66] . One study [97] showed that an 
increase in fuel water content from 17% to 26% resulted in a 15% 
longer ignition delay time due to slower vaporization and a 25% 
longer burning time; both effects decreased with increasing tem- 
perature. Under the conditions tested, the fuel’s average molecu- 
lar weight was found to be as important to the ignition delay as 
the fuel’s water content with lower molecular weight being better

because the fuel would tend to have more volatile/lighter compo- 
nents. This is related to FPBOs having undergone greater thermal 
cracking during production, see Section 2.1 , which tends to provide 
more favorable ignition chemistry. 

Engine operation with FPBO results in greater in-cylinder pres- 
sures  (by  about  15%)  and  a  higher  heat  release  rate  than  dur- 
ing  diesel  operation.  Both  the  pressure  and  thermal  effects  are 
thought to be caused by the fuel’s longer ignition delay which gen- 
erates a higher premixed combustion fraction. These effects help to 
counter the consequences of the fuel’s water content, as the wa- 
ter  creates  a  more  uniform  cylinder  temperature  proﬁle  as  well 
[55 , 103 , 114 , 132] .  One  test,  however,  found  the  peak  heat  release 
rate  from  FPBO  to  be  lower  than  during  diesel  operation  [164] . 
Looking at pressure, a higher peak value can accelerate chemical 
reactions, but it would also be responsible for greater internal me- 
chanical stresses on the engine [66] . Despite the high peak pres- 
sure, the pressure rise rate with FPBO was still found to be less 
than that of diesel in spite of its low cetane number (long igni- 
tion delay) [56 , 66 , 164] . Pressure rise was also not as smooth when 
running on FPBO, but ﬂuctuations were not considered critical and 
were somewhat typical of heavy fuel oil operation [132 , 165] . Fur- 
thermore, pressure traces did not show constant pressure expan- 
sion after the initial pressure rise like with diesel fuel, but FPBO 
powered diesel engines are still considered to be capable of run- 
ning smoothly [66] . The timing of peak pressure was the same for 
both diesel and FPBO [103] . 

Results from larger compression-ignition engines run on FPBO 
seem to be fairly consistent and showed promise. Larger engines 
offer superior fuel ﬂexibility because they have bigger clearances 
that can resist clogging, offer longer residence times, are less likely 
to suffer from wall quenching and deposits and operate at slower 
speeds for reduced wear. In one experiment, a modiﬁed, medium- 
speed, 250 kW engine was run with crude FPBO and 5% diesel (on 
an energy basis and for ignition purposes) as a pilot fuel, accruing 
about 450 hours of successful operation. The engine was started 
on diesel and when warm was switched to FPBO with methanol 
used in-between to facilitate the change-over; the process was re- 
versed  during  shutdown.  Initial  batches  of  FPBO  were  untreated 
with no ﬁltering, blending or other enhancement, though subse- 
quent batches were deemed to be of lower quality and required 
ﬁltering and centrifugation. Continuous operation was limited to 
approximately nine hours. When the contribution from diesel fuel 
was  reduced  to  2–2.5%,  engine  operation  became  erratic  due  to 
unstable combustion, returning to normal operation when the 5% 
diesel injection was re-established [38 , 167 , 168] . These results were 
in agreement with a separate experiment that found that engine 
operation with a diesel pilot was successful around the range of 
3.2–4.6%, but testing could not be done to ﬁnd the optimum oper- 
ating point [132] . The ﬁrst study also found that without the diesel 
pilot, the engine seized because the FPBO would not ignite at nor- 
mal diesel engine conditions (i.e. compression ratios and temper- 
atures). Examination after seizure showed heavy deposits of un- 
burnt fuel coating all surfaces, requiring removal with methanol. 
Furthermore, increased amounts of pilot fuel injection did not en- 
hance  performance,  nor  did  blending  5–30%  methanol  with  the 
FPBO. The engine was able to operate smoothly entirely on FPBO 
and diesel with no deterioration in output and only a 2% decrease 
in  eﬃciency  from  standard  diesel  operation,  though  larger  vol- 
umes of fuel were required due to FPBO’s lower energy content 
[38 , 167 , 168] .  One  ﬁnal  larger  engine  experiment  to  highlight  in- 
volves a 305 kW engine that ran for 12 hours using ﬁltered FPBO, 
mixed in-line with diesel (diesel providing 4% of the total energy 
content). Once components, such as the fuel pump and injectors, 
were fabricated from corrosion resistant materials, CO levels were 
only slightly elevated while other emissions were within regula- 
tions and no major operational issues were reported [9 , 33 , 56] . 

Small, high-speed engine operation is possible with FPBO, but 
generally requires some fuel modiﬁcations. For instance, the blend- 
ing of 72% FPBO, 24% methane and 4% cetane-improver ultimately 
performed as well as diesel in a high-speed engine [38] . One study 
[26] tested crude FPBO against physically and chemically upgraded 
FPBO to determine the effects on the performance of a 20 kW en- 
gine. The FPBO was physically upgraded via blending (60% FPBO, 
30% butanol and 10% biodiesel) and emulsiﬁcation (95% FPBO, 5% 
biodiesel to improve ignition and a small amount of an emulsiﬁer) 
and chemically upgraded via mild hydrodeoxygenation and reac- 
tive distillation. The fuels were preheated to around 50 °C and all 
upgraded fuels showed generally better performance, with the dif- 
ference diminishing at higher loads (higher in-cylinder tempera- 
tures) in terms of CO emissions. The emulsion performed similarly 
to the crude FPBO and the blended FPBO performed best, being 
the  only  fuel  to  show  substantially  reduced  CO  emissions  at  all 
loads compared to the crude FPBO. With respect to NO x  forma- 
tion, crude FPBO had the lowest emissions, followed closely by the 
emulsion while the blended FPBO had much higher emissions, but 
was still below both chemically upgraded fuels. Fuel NO x emissions 
were positively correlated to fuel volumetric heating values. Up- 
graded fuels were easier to ignite so CO emissions decreased while 
NO x  emissions increased, but the effect on overall eﬃciency was 
less signiﬁcant. In addition, all fuels were still acidic after upgrad- 
ing and therefore still necessitated injection system modiﬁcations. 
Economically, having to modify both the engine and fuel is quite 
disadvantageous. One ﬁnal experiment was conducted within this 
study, blending ethanol with FPBO to reduce viscosity, along with 
enhancing the fuel’s atomization and ignition. During this test, air 
preheating was increased to 120 °C to increase combustion temper- 
atures. It was found that up to 30 wt.% ethanol in FPBO reduced CO 
emissions and increased NO x emissions and the overall eﬃciency 
of the engine [26] . This single cylinder (10 kW) engine has been 
operated for over 400 hours on FPBO or FPBO blends, including a 
52 hour continuous run time on a 20% FPBO/ethanol blend with- 
out any wear detected visually on the pump or injector. The same 
group then tested a four cylinder (about 50 kW) engine with a 20% 
FPBO/ethanol blend, ﬁnding a similar overall eﬃciency, but higher 
fuel consumption compared to diesel operation with 60 °C or less 
of fuel preheating [163 , 169] . 

Another study [112] tested FPBO, upgraded via hydrotreatment 
(detailed fuel analysis provided in original paper), in a high-speed, 
5 kW, stationary diesel engine using standard steel injectors. An 
initial test found that crude FPBO caused the engine to fail within 
30 minutes of operation (air preheating unspeciﬁed). Meanwhile, 
the upgraded FPBO required air preheating between 60 and 170 °C 
for fuel viscosity reduction to allow for successful and stable op- 
eration (30 minute intervals, 1.5 hours total), without which the 
engine failed rapidly. Conversely, diesel fuel required no inlet air 
heating. Higher levels of fuel upgrading allowed for stable oper- 
ation at signiﬁcantly lower air preheating temperatures with re- 
duced CO emissions, though still well above the emissions from 
diesel operation, likely due to differences in atomization charac- 
teristics. Substantial coking, corrosion and erosion were found on 
the injector, both around and within the exit oriﬁce, after a failed 
ﬁrst test with upgraded FPBO using no air preheating. The poten- 
tial erosive effects of FPBO (because of fuel’s solid content) on an 
injector are illustrated in Figs. 9 and 10 . Images showed that the 
exit oriﬁce had also actually increased in diameter by about 30% 
and had become elliptical. This injector would have poorly atom- 
ized the FPBO, deteriorating ignition and combustion performance, 
which likely caused the engine to fail. The results from the ﬁrst 
injector test matched the ﬁndings of many other studies described 
in this section investigating crude FPBO. The injector was replaced 
for subsequent testing with air preheating (varying fuel quantity 
and engine loading) and after all runs were complete, substantial

coking was also found on the second injector (even though a ﬁnal 
engine test with diesel likely burned some of the deposits away), 
though no engine failure occurred. After testing, the second injec- 
tor still had a smooth surface with no signs of corrosion or erosion 
and the exit oriﬁce was undamaged. 

In spite of several successful tests on the use of FPBO in diesel 
engines (particularly in the slow- and medium-speed ones), sim- 
ilar  to  gas  turbine  engines,  there  exists  no  report  on  the  long- 
term  operation  of  these  engines  in  the  available  literature.  The 
challenges  regarding  the  use  of  FPBO  in  diesel  engines  and  the 
main hindrances to long-term testing are summarized as follows 
[24 , 38 , 47 , 48 , 103 , 132 , 162 , 164] : 

• high viscosity causing poor atomization 
• FPBO’s poor ignition and low cetane number 
• the tendency for corrosion and erosion, particularly for compo- 

nents operating at higher speeds and/or temperatures [9] 

• clogging of the injection system and pump 
• propensity for coke/char residue deposition along the fuel in- 
jection system and/or combustion cylinder, leading to valve, in- 
jector, pump and/or piston failure, wear and/or seizure 

4. FPBO atomization 

Spray formation procedure, so-called atomization, is one of the 
most  critical  aspects  of  liquid  fuel  combustion.  Smaller  droplets 
have a larger relative surface area, allowing for more rapid heat 
transfer and increased vaporization since vaporization is inversely 
related  to  the  droplet  diameter  squared  [62] .  Enhanced  vapor- 
ization  greatly  improves  fuel/air  mixing  and  ignition  while  re- 
ducing  the  required  fuel  droplet  residence  (burnout)  time  and 
accordingly  the  ﬂame  length.  Therefore,  better  atomization  ul- 
timately  improves  combustion  processes  and  reduces  emissions 
[58 , 93 , 97 , 131 , 154 , 170] . Atomization is by nature a random and un- 
steady process [58 , 170] . Eﬃcient atomization relies predominantly 
upon three fuel properties: viscosity ( μ), surface tension ( σ ) and 
density ( ρ); viscosity is generally considered to be the most impor- 
tant property and density the least important one [8 , 35 , 58 , 86 , 93] . 

The effects of atomization are even more important when work- 
ing with high viscous and diﬃcult-to-burn fuels like FPBO. Typ- 
ically, for light fuel oils, simple pressure or pressure-swirl atom- 
ization is used, creating droplets in the range of 20–60 microns 
while for more viscous heavy fuel oils, steam/air assisted or ro- 
tating cup atomization is used more frequently. For light fuel oils, 
minimal or no fuel preheating is required while for heavy fuel oils, 
fuel preheating to 85–140 °C is common with far higher atomiz- 
ing pressures in order to get droplets in the 50–70 micron range 
[131 , 149] . However, excess preheating of FPBO compared to heavy 
fuel oils could result in fuel polymerization, nozzle clogging, and 
severe  fuel  quality  degradation.  The  FPBO  atomization  complica- 
tions, along with its dependency on liquid fuel properties requires 
a good knowledge on the underlying physics of atomization and 
spray.  In  this  section,  therefore,  following  a  brief  description  of 
spray formation mechanisms in Section 4.1 , common fuel nozzles 
employed in combustion applications are introduced in Section 4.2 , 
and ﬁnally, different strategies for having an eﬃcient atomization 
of FPBO are proposed in Section 4.3 . 

4.1. Spray formation mechanisms 

Spray  droplets  are  generated  by  the  breakup  or  disintegra- 
tion  process  of  a  liquid  jet  or  sheet  occurring  when  disrupting 
forces  overwhelm  consolidating  ones.  Generally,  there  exist  two 
basic  spray  formation  mechanisms  in  spray  combustion  applica- 
tions, namely classical and prompt primary atomization [58 , 170] . 
The  classical  mechanism  relies  on  the  creation  of  small  distur- 
bances/instabilities, either within or on the surface of a liquid jet 
or sheet, which promote the formation of waves that eventually 
lead to its disintegration into ligaments and droplets whose char- 
acteristics depend on liquid physical properties, operating condi- 
tions, and nozzle design [171–173] . Turbulence enhances disinte- 
gration of the liquid as surface waves and roughness form while 
aerodynamic forces increase with increasing relative (air to liquid) 
velocity and air density. Increasing liquid surface tension, viscosity 
and jet/sheet thickness, along with decreasing turbulence and rel- 
ative velocity, all result in larger droplet size distribution, which is

commonly quantiﬁed in combustion applications with the Sauter 
mean diameter (SMD). SMD represents a measure of the volume 
to surface area ratio of an average droplet within a given spray, as 
calculated via the summation of droplet diameters using Eq. (4.1 ) 
[8 , 58 , 92 , 97] :

In the prompt atomization process, however, the jet or sheet 
has no time to develop a wavy structure, but is immediately torn 
into fragments by its interaction with the air (i.e., ambient air or 
atomizing air) at an appreciable air-liquid relative velocity and/or 
impingement angle [153] . An essential feature of this mode of at- 
omization is that the rapid and violent disruption of the liquid en- 
sures that the generated droplet sizes are largely independent of 
the initial fuel dimension (jet diameter or sheet thickness) or vis- 
cosity [153] . In this mechanism, therefore, droplet size distribution 
is predominately controlled by the magnitude of the air velocity 
component normal to the liquid, along with the air-to-liquid mass 
ﬂow ratio (ALR) and surface tension [174] . 

To get insight into the operation of different types of nozzle, 
the spray formation of the both liquid jets and sheets are brieﬂy 
explained in the following paragraphs. For most liquid jets, aero- 
dynamic drag tears their surface into ﬁne ligaments from which 
surface tension acts to form spherical droplets where they have a 
minimal surface energy and resist any further distortion or disin- 
tegration [58 , 170] . Smaller jets break up more easily because they 
are  susceptible  to  a  wider  range  of  disturbances,  determined  by 
jet  circumference.  There  are  however  several  different  modes  of 
breakup  depicted  in  Fig.  11  depending  on  the  Reynolds  number 
(inﬂuenced strongly by jet velocity) and the characteristics of the 
surrounding medium. 

Liquid sheets have a larger surface energy and an increased sus- 
ceptibility  to  disturbances  and  instabilities  as  compared  to  jets, 
especially if they are curved, and as such tend to result in ﬁner 
sprays [58 , 170] . After injection, a sheet expands and thins against 
the contraction force of surface tension. High liquid surface ten- 
sion and viscosity make sheets more resilient to disintegration, in- 
creasing ligament size, breakup length and spray SMD, while liquid 
density has a negligible effect [58 , 93 , 170] . Ultimately, the formed 
droplet size distribution, which describes the volume percent (or 
frequency of occurrence if number-based) of various droplet sizes 
within  a  given  spray,  is  dependent  on  ligament  uniformity  with 
small ligaments stemming from thin sheets at a high relative ve- 

locity [58 , 170] . Liquid sheet atomization modes are illustrated in 
Fig. 12 . 

The basic process of atomization when viewed as the growth 
of  instabilities  or  prompt  atomization  is  similar  for  both  sheet 
and jet conﬁgurations, however the detailed mechanisms do dif- 
fer and are described in detail within the textbooks written by Liu 
[170] and Lefebvre [58] , referenced throughout this section. For the 
both liquid jets and sheets, the generated droplets can break up 
further and form smaller droplets, when the magnitude of aerody- 
namic forces (increased with higher ambient pressure and/or den- 
sity)  within  the  spray/combustion  environment  exceed  the  con- 
solidating force of surface tension, known as secondary atomiza- 
tion  [58 , 170] .  That  is,  droplets  will  continue  to  disintegrate  into 
smaller  diameters  until  reaching  a  critical  size  where  the  forces 
are balanced. Droplet breakup time increases as the droplets ap- 
proach  their  ﬁnal  critical  size  as  forces  equalize,  and  liquid  vis- 
cosity  also  acts  to  slow  down  this  process.  In  essence,  atomiza- 
tion is a chaotic process and during secondary atomization, in ad- 
dition to droplet disintegration, droplets may also collide and/or 
coalesce, forming a wide ﬁnal size distribution [170] . The result- 
ing non-uniform spray will have populations of small droplets that 
evaporate quickly, helping to improve ignition, along with popu- 
lations of large droplets which require longer residence times for 
complete evaporation and combustion. 

4.2. Common fuel nozzles 

The most common nozzle designs for spray combustion appli- 
cations are based on pressure and twin-ﬂuid atomization [153] . In 
these nozzles, liquid fuel is injected in the form of a jet or sheet, 
depending on the conﬁguration of the nozzle. The process of liq- 
uid jet disintegration is of great importance for the design of plain- 
oriﬁce pressure nozzles or plain-jet twin-ﬂuid nozzles, whereas the 
mechanism of liquid sheet breakup has direct relevance to the per- 
formance of simplex pressure nozzles or preﬁlming twin-ﬂuid noz- 
zles. A schematic view of these nozzles is illustrated in Fig. 13 . 

Pressure atomization is accomplished by forcing liquid through 
a small oriﬁce (plain-oriﬁce pressure atomizer) which forms a nar- 
row  angle,  solid-cone  spray  or  the  outlet  can  be  preceded  by  a 
swirl  chamber  (pressure-swirl  or  simplex  atomizer),  causing  the 
liquid to leave the nozzle as an annular sheet expanding radially 
outwards  as  a  solid  or  hollow-cone  spray  with  a  comparatively 
wider cone angle [58] . Solid-cone sprays result in more uniformly 
sized  droplets,  but  hollow-cone  sprays  provide  ﬁner  atomization

sion of Elsevier. 

(this is also the case with twin-ﬂuid nozzles) [171 , 175] . Higher at- 
omization pressures and wider spray angles result in ﬁner sprays 
because  the  liquid  sheet  thins  out  and  the  spray  pattern  allows 
for more air exposure [58 , 92] . Pressure atomization is used exten- 
sively in light fuel oil combustion applications due to its simplicity 
[24 , 116] . Nonetheless, the high pressures required for this type of 
atomization can also cause wear/abrasion, erosion and ultimately 
performance degradation [60 , 171] . 

Twin-ﬂuid  nozzles  induce  large  interfacial  forces,  particularly 
shear [92 , 176] , between high velocity air and low velocity liquid 
(large relative velocity) to cause the liquid to disintegrate into lig- 
aments and ultimately droplets [58 , 171 , 176] . These nozzles are op- 
posite in principle to pressure atomization which injects fast mov- 
ing liquid into comparatively still air, though the relative ﬂuid ve- 
locity is still one of the critical parameters and plays an equally 
important role [177] . Among twin-ﬂuid atomizers, air-assisted noz- 
zles use small amounts of highly pressurized air at very high ve- 
locities  for  atomization,  while  air-blast  nozzles  use  much  larger 
amounts of air at lower pressures to form a spray [174] . Twin-ﬂuid 
nozzles can be further broken down into internally mixed or ex- 
ternally  mixed  varieties.  For  internally  mixed  twin-ﬂuid  nozzles, 
much  of  their  ligament  and  droplet  formation,  also  classiﬁed  as 
primary atomization, occurs within the nozzle [178 , 179] . Externally 
mixed ones are of a less eﬃcient atomization scheme, but their 
design prevents the oxidizer from entering the fuel line in com- 
bustion applications, preventing ﬂashback and improving safety. In 
both cases, secondary atomization occurs exclusively outside of the 
nozzle. 

Compared  to  pressure  atomization,  twin-ﬂuid  nozzles  pro- 
vide  a  more  even  spray  dispersion,  have  larger  internal  cross- 
sections  to  resist  clogging,  are  effective  over  a  wider  operating 
range  and  allow  for  independent  control  of  air  and  liquid  ﬂow 
rates  [58 , 60 , 92 , 116 , 178 , 180–183] .  Twin-ﬂuid  nozzles  however,  are 
also  more  complex  and  are  therefore,  generally  more  expensive 
[24 , 92 , 116] . For twin-ﬂuid nozzles, the ALR is typically the most 
crucial spray parameter affecting SMD and is directly related to the 
air/liquid relative velocity. Higher ALR values reduce the spray SMD 
and generally display asymptotic behavior beyond a certain point 
[60 , 184–191] . Furthermore, larger ALR values indicate a greater rel- 
ative velocity between the air and liquid, meaning that more en- 
ergy  is  available  to  break  up  the  liquid  fuel.  In  reacting  sprays, 
a higher atomizing airﬂow rate also induces stronger turbulence 
that  can  enhance  mixing,  but  consequently  also  increases  shear 
rates, which if too high can cause the ﬂame to extinguish or pre- 
vent (re)ignition. Overall, twin-ﬂuid nozzles are relatively insensi- 
tive to liquid properties or those of the surrounding gas medium 
[58] . In particular, twin-ﬂuid nozzles are far less sensitive to liq- 
uid viscosity than pressure atomizers, making them good for highly 

viscous fuels (as viscosity had a minimal effect on atomization in 
two studies up to 100–120cP [156 , 182 , 183] ), particularly if inter- 
nally mixed [58 , 93 , 154 , 156 , 182 , 183] . Therefore, twin-ﬂuid atomiz- 
ers  are  often  used  with  heavy  fuel  oils  and  FPBO  [86] .  In  com- 
bustion applications, twin-ﬂuid nozzles also enhance fuel/oxidizer 
mixing compared to pressure atomization which can increase com- 
bustion eﬃciency and reduce pollutants [58 , 180 , 181 , 192] . 

4.3. Strategies for FPBO atomization 

While  FPBO  is  a  promising  fossil  oil  alternative,  its  physi- 
cal  properties  (e.g.,  viscosity  and  surface  tension)  hinder  an  ef- 
ﬁcient  atomization,  further  exacerbating  the  diﬃculties  associ- 
ated  with  its  combustion  and  making  it  more  diﬃcult  to  com- 
pete with lighter fuel oils. FPBO’s viscosity can be upwards of 50 
times that of fuel oil number 2 (sitting between light and heavy 
fuel oils [103] ), and its surface tension can be about 30% greater 
[40 , 151] , see  Table 1 .  Therefore, the  typical spray SMD for FPBO 
is  signiﬁcantly  larger  than  that  of  diesel  sprays  [9]  resulting  in 
longer ﬂames [193] and many combustion diﬃculties discussed in 
Section  3 .  For  instance,  as  a  result  of  FPBO’s  low  volatility  and 
solids content, the fuel is tougher to ignite and requires longer res- 
idence times for full burnout. FPBO droplets, therefore, have to be 
smaller than those of conventional fuels, which necessitates more 
atomization energy [175] . This means a higher atomizing air pres- 
sure or relative velocity (ALR) for twin-ﬂuid nozzles, or a higher 
liquid  pressure  for  pressure  atomizers.  Nonetheless,  this  greater 
amount  of  energy  imparted  to  the  droplets  could  increase  the 
ﬂame shear, causing ﬂame lift-off or blow-out. It could increase the 
likelihood of larger droplets blowing through the combustion zone 
prior to complete burnout, causing a lower combustion eﬃciency 
and higher emissions [194] . In addition, the higher mass ﬂow rate 
(and  therefore  linear  momentum)  of  FPBO,  due  to  its  lower  en- 
ergy content, causes the fuel jet to penetrate deeper into the com- 
bustion chamber compared to diesel fuel [195] . These phenomena 
increase  the  possibilities  of  fuel  impingement  on  the  walls  and 
quenching of FPBO when used in combustion systems designed for 
fossil oils. As such, understanding and addressing the challenges of 
FPBO atomization is crucial for current and future implementation 
and commercialization initiatives, especially if FPBO is going to in- 
creasingly replace fossil oils. 

In  spite  of  the  diﬃculties  associated  with  FPBO  atomization, 
pressure-swirl nozzles [48] along with externally [40 , 151 , 196] and 
internally mixed [63 , 116 , 146 , 197] twin-ﬂuid nozzles have all been 
used  to  successfully  atomize  it  with  exploiting  different  strate- 
gies.  Fuel  preheating,  up  to  about  80  °C,  is  a  simple  ﬁrst  step 
for improving the atomization quality of FPBO because it reduces 
the fuel’s viscosity and surface tension, thereby lowering the en-

19 

tensions were similar [198] . In a subsequent experiment at identi- 
cal operating parameters using a pressure atomizing simplex noz- 
zle,  the  same  two  fuels,  an  80%  FPBO/ethanol  blend  and  canola 
oil, showed very different ﬂow patterns. The canola oil formed a 
proper hollow cone conﬁguration just downstream of the nozzle 
as  intended,  but  the  FPBO  blend  emerged  from  the  nozzle  as  a 
non-atomized jet [116] . Hence, while canola oil, can be used as a 
spray surrogate for FPBO [92 , 116] due to its kinematic viscosity and 
surface tension, it only produces reasonably accurate results under 
certain conditions and veriﬁcations need to be conducted before 
surrogate results can be relied upon. 

In  addition  to  the  primary  breakup/atomization  of  fuel,  one 
study  [40]  found  that  combustor  preheating  is  also  effective  for 
reducing  spray  SMD  due  to  secondary  breakup  of  the  droplets. 
They observed that when FPBO was injected into a combustor, the 
droplets formed a tail from aerodynamic forces. When the combus- 
tor was cold, the tail morphed back into the droplet, increasing its 
diameter under the action of surface tension. However, when the 
combustor  was  hot,  the  injected  droplet  heated  up,  reducing  its 
surface tension, and the tail formed into smaller satellite droplets, 
creating a smaller average droplet size, see Fig. 17 . In addition, pre- 
heating the primary air and/or atomizing air increases fuel vapor- 
ization and reduces the density of the air which increases its (rel- 
ative) velocity (assuming a constant mass ﬂow rate) to ultimately 
lower the spray SMD [40] . 

A separate study [199] of unheated vegetable oil sprays from 
an air-blast nozzle made several relevant conclusions. It found that 
co-ﬂow swirling air reduces the spray SMD and widens the spray 
cone angle, improving atomization. The SMD reduction was due to 
enhanced secondary breakup of the droplets, evidenced by an in- 
creasing droplet size discrepancy between the swirling and non- 
swirling experiments downstream of the nozzle. In addition, fuel 
preheating increased the spray’s mean axial velocity, improving at- 
omization  and  resulting  in  a  narrower  droplet  size  distribution. 
High fuel and air temperatures also increased fuel vaporization, re- 
ducing the radial width of the spray since the droplets had less 
momentum (the cold spray penetrated further axially and radially). 
In  general,  with  adequate  fuel  preheating  and  proper  op- 
erating  parameters,  FPBO  can  be  atomized  effectively  to  an 
SMD  near  or  below  50  microns  (comparable  to  conventional 
fossil  oil  sprays  [9 , 131 , 200] ),  even  with  pressure  atomization 
[9 , 4 8 , 92 , 116 , 131 , 14 9 , 197 , 201] .  However,  not  all  studies  were  able 
to  achieve  success  using  pressure  atomization  [116]  and  not  all 
studies  were  conducted  in  conjunction  with  combustion  testing 
which generates additional atomization constraints in order to pre- 
vent  excessive  ﬂame  shear,  causing  lift-off and  blow-out.  Even 
with effective injection system design and preheating, considera- 
tion  should  be  given  to  the  FPBO  droplet  size  distribution  since 
even with an acceptable spray SMD some large droplets can form. 
These larger droplets could fail to evaporate or ignite, reduce ﬂame 
stability  through  poorer  mixing  and  ignition,  and  result  in  in- 
complete combustion and/or wall quenching, forming deposits and 
emissions [9 , 40 , 48 , 92 , 121 , 201] . In fact, in spray experiments, FPBO 
formed wider spray distribution size ranges than did water or light 
fuel oil [121 , 201] . Residence time considerations must, therefore, 
account for the upper range of the spray distribution for optimized 
FPBO combustion. 

A summary of the nozzles used in the FPBO atomization, along 
with their generated spray SMD and their employed measurement 
techniques, is presented in Table S1 in the Supplementary Mate- 
rial. Except the ones who used the empirical correlations available 
in  the  literature,  they  mostly  used  either  Malvern  laser  diffrac- 
tion particle sizer or high-speed imaging with background light- 
ing for predicting the spray SMD. The Malvern measurements are 
related to the older instruments relying on Fraunhofer approxima- 
tion, which is suitable for the particles which are opaque and their

ergy required for atomization [103] . Fuel preheating also acceler- 
ates vaporization which is especially useful for heavier fuels with 
lower  volatility  [10] .  It  should  be,  however,  noted  that  temper- 
atures  near  or  above  80  °C  can  lead  to  rapid  fuel  polymeriza- 
tion, nozzle clogging and severe fuel quality degradation so pre- 
heating should always be done in-line, just prior to fuel injection 
[8 , 24 , 35 , 40 , 62 , 103 , 157] . For comparison, heavy fuel oils are often 
preheated up to 140 °C to get droplets near the size of lighter fuel 
oils, such as diesel [131] . With adequate preheating, the viscosity 
of FPBO will likely be between 5 and 10cSt [62] which is good for 
pumping, atomization, ignition, combustion and emissions mitiga- 
tion. 

A direct comparative spray assessment of a preheated FPBO and 
diesel was conducted using a diesel engine injection system, corre- 
sponding to pressure atomization [103] . At 50 °C, the diesel spray 
had a 10 micron SMD and the FPBO spray had a 100–110 micron 
SMD.  At  a  fuel  temperature  of  70  °C,  the  FPBO  SMD  was  sub- 
stantially reduced to between 35 and 45 microns and slightly re- 
duced further to 30 microns at 90 °C (still well above the SMD of 
diesel). It should be noted that the FPBO in this study was aged 
for one year prior to testing, so the differences in its SMD as com- 
pared to diesel are likely exaggerated. The substantial reduction in 
SMD as temperature increases follows a similar proﬁle to a typi- 
cal FPBO viscosity curve, see Fig. 14 , with a rapid decline followed 
by an asymptotic progression and likely little improvement above 
80 °C [70 , 146] . The viscosity of FPBO decreases faster with tem- 
perature than the viscosity of light or heavy conventional fuel oils 
[56 , 66 , 162] . While different FPBOs have different absolute values of 
viscosity, they all display the same temperature dependence and 
behavior [35] . 

Another  effective  strategy  for  FPBO  atomization  is  alcohol 
blending which greatly lowers viscosity (see Fig. 14 ) and surface 
tension and increases mixture volatility [24 , 40 , 137 , 196] . One study, 
for example, reported that the addition of 12 wt.% ethanol at 50 °C 
had a similar effect with respect to the spray SMD and the droplet 
size distribution as pre-heating the fuel to 70 °C without ethanol 
addition [103] . Direct spray comparisons between canola oil and 
an aged 80% FPBO/ethanol blend (ﬁltered to 100 microns), using 
a twin-ﬂuid nozzle, indicate that both unheated fuels follow the 
same trends, though FPBO had larger droplets and longer ligament 
retention (a longer breakup length) than canola oil at equal atom- 
izing  air  pressures.  With  increasing  air  pressure,  the  two  sprays 
became  more  similar  and  so  FPBO  blends  are  more  sensitive  to 
the effects of atomizing air than canola oil as shown in Figs. 15 
and 16 [116] . A separate study, using twin-ﬂuid atomizers, found 
that the spray SMD of lower viscosity FPBOs were less sensitive 
to changes in ALR than higher viscosity ones, while their surface

sphericities are not important like FPBO spray. Nonetheless, using 
the Malvern instruments based on Mie theory, which is accurate 
just for spherical and transparent particles [202] , would be inac- 
curate for the spray SMD measurements of dark-color FPBO with 
a refractive index of about 1.47 at 22 °C [53] . In addition, laser di- 
agnostics are not able to show the spray formation mechanism in 
the near nozzle region (i.e., primary breakup morphology), which 
plays  an  important  role  in  the  subsequent  spray  characteristics. 
Therefore, the use of image based diagnostics, see e.g., [203] , which 
is capable of visualizing the near nozzle region and is not sensi- 
tive to the transparency and shape of the particles, would be of a 
great advantage for FPBO droplet sizing. Other techniques like x- 
ray phase contrast imaging or radiography may be also useful for 
investigation of FPBO sprays [204] . 

Overall, while pressure atomization in conventional burner ap- 
plications  is  most  common  and  has  been  shown  to  suitably  at- 
omize FPBO under the right conditions, twin-ﬂuid atomization can 
still usually form a ﬁner spray [40 , 48 , 93 , 131] . Pressure atomization 

with FPBO also faces large challenges with respect to clogging and 
erosion  due  to  fuel  particulates  and  the  nozzle’s  small  passage- 
ways/clearances which are required to build up a high pressure. 
The high pressures required to form small enough FPBO droplets 
for adequate atomization, combined with the fuel’s high viscosity, 
creates signiﬁcant pumping challenges [40 , 93 , 116] . It is therefore 
likely that a preheated FPBO with a low solids content would be 
required for successful pressure atomization. With pressure atom- 
ization,  higher  fuel  viscosities  have  been  shown  to  increase  the 
breakup length, degrading atomization quality [93] . For combus- 
tion purposes, breakup length is of great importance with respect 
to  evaporation,  ignition  and  stability  [58] .  It  is  also  critical  if  a 
seated ﬂame is desired for the application; seated ﬂames can of- 
ten reduce the likelihood of ﬂame extinction [64] . Externally mixed 
twin-ﬂuid  atomizers  have  been  successfully  used  in  FPBO  com- 
bustion applications to form stable ﬂames [40 , 151] , but one study 
tested  both  an  internally-mixed  and  an  externally-mixed  nozzle, 
concluding that the internally-mixed twin-ﬂuid conﬁguration was

21 

much more effective with FPBO [61] , making it generally the best 
option for FPBO atomization. In this regard, one study [69] sug- 
gested that the reason internally mixed twin-ﬂuid nozzles, specif- 
ically internally mixed air-blast nozzles, were more effective with 
FPBO is because they rely on the prompt mechanism for atomiza- 
tion, which is dependent primarily on surface tension, rather than 
classic atomization mechanisms that rely heavily on viscosity. Ac- 
cording to Tables 1 and 4, the preheated FPBO and room tempera- 
ture diesel can differ by about 10% in surface tension, but often by 
about 20 0–50 0% in viscosity, with FPBO being higher in both cases. 
Therefore, the internally mixed nozzles are likely to be more suc- 
cessful in reducing the spray SMD differential between preheated 
FPBO and room temperature diesel fuel, which many studies com- 
pare, with minimum combustion problems such as coking, clog- 
ging and ﬂame instability. 

Another  atomization  mechanism  that  may  be  found  during 
FPBO  spray  combustion  is  ﬂash-boiling  (or  ﬂash  atomization) 
which  in  conjunction  with  large  droplet  micro-explosion  (see 
Section 5.1 ) can generate a ﬁne-droplet spray. In ﬂash atomization, 
the bubbles formed in the fuel (due to the boiling of preheated fuel 
within the nozzle prior to injection) act as an atomizing gas dur- 
ing the discharge process and shatter the liquid ligaments which 
in  turn  decrease  the  droplet  size  [58 , 171 , 205] .  The  addition  of 
volatile compounds, such as an alcohol like methanol or ethanol, 
will speed up the onsets of ﬂash atomization and micro-explosions. 
However, controlling ﬂash atomization requires accurate tempera- 
ture, pressure and ﬂow rate control and also good knowledge of 
the fuel’s physicochemical properties. Otherwise, it could result in 
combustion instabilities and even ﬂame blow-out [24 , 40 , 63] , and 
must be prevented by adding a water cooling system to the noz- 
zle [4 , 117] . While developing experimental investigations or high- 
ﬁdelity  numerical  simulations  is  necessary  to  effectively  control 
the ﬂash boiling within a nozzle, the use of effervescent atomiza- 
tion (in which air/gas is directly introduced into the bulk liquid 
within the nozzle prior to injection [58 , 171 , 206] ) can be useful. 

Recently, ﬁner sprays with unheated vegetable oil, as compared 
to the conventional twin-ﬂuid atomizers, have been obtained us- 
ing a novel atomization strategy known as ﬂow blurring [194 , 207] . 
This method uses a cross-ﬂowing gas to disrupt the liquid stream 
within the nozzle and mix the two ﬂuids; the expansion of the gas 
phase as the mixture then passes through the nozzle-exit ﬁnely at- 
omizes the liquid. This type of internal mixing twin ﬂuid atomizer 
are under study for the atomization of highly viscous liquids such 
as heavy fuel oils, biofuels, or waste fuels with prospects of emis- 
sion reduction [208 , 209] . Hybrid atomizers are also very common 
for the atomization of highly viscous liquids. They combine several 
different atomization mechanisms to achieve ﬁner droplets. For in- 
stance, a twin-ﬂuid swirl nozzle like the one used by [210] or air- 
assist pressure-swirl atomizer [211] , combines swirling effect and 
the air-assist atomization effect to achieve better atomization and 
fuel/air mixing. 

5. FPBO combustion 

Spray combustion of FPBO usually occurs in a non-premixed or 
diffusion combustion mode as FPBO cannot be fully vaporized (see 
Section 2.2 for fuel properties). For non-premixed conditions, the 
ﬂame sheet (i.e. the interface between the fuel and air) burns at a 
stoichiometric equivalence ratio of one. Under these conditions, the 
ﬂame temperature is very high, as ﬂame temperatures peak at an 
equivalence ratio of about 1.1 [37] , imparting stability, but reducing 
control of the ﬂame parameters which can be useful for pollutant 
mitigation strategies. Since there is no pre-mixing of the fuel and 
oxidizer, diffusion ﬂames are inherently safer since ﬂashback can- 
not occur. This type of combustion is mixing-controlled, and both 
the mixing and chemical reaction rates increase with combustor 

pressure. Turbulence allows for the formation of compact ﬂames 
through rapid mixing, improving combustion performance, while 
slow mixing, based solely on diffusion processes (e.g., due to a low 
oxygen environment), results in long ﬂames. Poor fuel/air mixing 
can result in incomplete and/or localized combustion, forming high 
amounts of pollutants. The bright yellow/orange color associated 
with non-premixed ﬂames is typically the result of PM [36 , 37] . 

For low velocity gas-phase jets, non-premixed ﬂames stabilize 
at the nozzle exit, but as the jet velocity is increased, the ﬂame 
will  lift  off because  of  excessive  shear  leading  to  localized  ex- 
tinctions, and if the jet velocity is too high, the ﬂame will blow 
out [212] . Analogously, spray ﬂames should follow the same dy- 
namics  with  the  added  step  of  requiring  rapid  vaporization  of 
the fuel after atomization. Spray ﬂame stabilization occurs where 
small droplets are able to vaporize and appropriately mix with the 
oxidizer.  Upstream  of  a  stabilized,  lifted  ﬂame,  air  is  entrained, 
helping the spray/reactants to vaporize and mix at its base, akin 
to partially-premixed gas-phase jets. Similarly, air entrainment in 
spray ﬂames can increase with lift-off height and with co-ﬂowing 
air streams [213] . 

Practical spray combustion systems that rely on non-premixed 
ﬂames usually operate lean (i.e., with excess air). This helps to en- 
sure suﬃcient oxidation for complete combustion and minimizes 
the formation of localized rich zones that promote CO, UHC and 
PM emissions [36] . In addition, higher amounts of oxygen also help 
to oxidize any soot that does form and contribute in PM emissions. 
UHC and CO emissions can also form due to incomplete combus- 
tion (quenching) in regions that are too lean, mixing is too rapid 
due to high shear rates, and/or are close to combustor wall [36] . 
For  pressure  or  twin-ﬂuid  nozzles,  for  instance,  if  the  injection 
pressure or atomizing airﬂow rate is too high, ﬂame extinction or 
blowout  can  occur  due  to  high  shear  rates,  so  proper  operating 
conditions need to be determined depending on the objectives of 
the application. 

Similar  to  most  turbulent  non-premixed  gas-phase  ﬂames 
which  have  a  fuel  rich  core  and  burn  on  the  periphery  [36 , 37] , 
spray  ﬂame  is  typically  anchored  at  a  point  around  the  spray 
where  stoichiometry  allows  for  gas-phase  combustion  to  occur 
[214–216] . In essence, droplet burning rates are highly dependent 
on inter-droplet spacing [217–220] . Denser fuel droplet populations 
within the spray generate more deviation from single droplet com- 
bustion schemes. Dense sprays decrease droplet burning rates by 
forming a saturated, non-ﬂammable mixture that impedes thermal 
and oxidizer diffusion, preventing ignition near individual droplets. 
This  is  known  as  external  group  combustion  mode  [214–216] . 
Nonetheless,  as  droplet  spacing  increases,  the  ﬂame  approaches 
the spray and eventually penetrates its boundaries as an internal 
mode  of  combustion  becomes  dominant  [214–216] .  This  can  oc- 
cur as droplets burn and decrease in size or the spray expands. 
A schematic view of the spray combustion processes is illustrated 
in Fig. 18 . 

The  spray  combustion  of  fuels  such  as  FPBO  are  more  com- 
plex because they will not fully evaporate. Fuel sprays with low 
volatility, such as FPBO, and/or those that are injected at a high 
velocity can transition from an external to an internal combustion 
mode quickly, before signiﬁcant fuel droplet burnout. In addition, 
the droplet size distribution within a spray can affect its combus- 
tion rate. If droplet size decreases radially from the center-line of 
the spray, overall burning rates will be higher [214] . Since sprays 
are typically comprised of numerous ﬁne droplets, understanding 
single droplet combustion modes are an essential ﬁrst step in order 
to  comprehend  spray  combustion  mechanisms  and  dynamics.  In 
the following, therefore, the FPBO single droplet combustion is ﬁrst 
discussed in Section 5.1 , and then, after a discussion on the FPBO 
spray combustion, several strategies for having an eﬃcient spray 
combustion in different applications are proposed in Section 5.2 .

5.1. FPBO single droplet combustion 

In  practical  spray  combustion  systems,  preheat  and  burning 
rates/times of spray droplets are important for combustor design 
as they indicate where heat release is likely to occur and the re- 
quired residence time for full fuel burnout [95] . To estimate these 
parameters, it is much easier to ﬁrst study an isolated droplet sit- 
uated in an unbounded environment where it has no interaction 
with the rest of the droplet ensemble [222] . In conventional fossil 
oils, the preheat and burning rates/times of an isolated droplet are 
proportional to the square of the droplet’s diameter (D) according 
to D 2 law, so proper atomization is critical to ensure an adequate 
combustor residence time [58 , 103 , 110] . In essence, since chemical 
reactions are very fast during combustion, the burning time is of- 
ten controlled by the rate of fuel droplet vaporization which in- 
creases with convective effects [58] . Once the fuel droplet reaches 
a suﬃcient temperature, it ignites and enters a steady burning pe- 
riod following the D 2 law until reaching a small enough diameter 
where increasing heat losses cause the ﬂame to extinguish [222] . 
All the stages are illustrated in Fig. 19 . In this regard, since FPBOs 
typically burn slower, combustors would need to be lengthened for 
suﬃcient residence times, widened to prevent wall impingement, 
and/or FPBO droplet diameters would need to be reduced which 
would be diﬃcult given the fuel’s unfavorable atomization charac- 
teristics. Furthermore, the effect of higher FPBO ﬂow rates per unit 
energy input, compared to fossil oils, on atomization and fuel/air 
mixing would need to be taken into account.

law is shown graphically with droplet size on the left axis and 
ﬂame size on the right axis, where D o and D f are initial droplet diameter and ﬂame 
diameter, respectively. 

For  conventional  fossil  oils  injected  into  a  steady-state  ﬂame 
system, it is known that an isolated droplet initially enters a pre- 
heat  period  during  which  the  droplet  begins  to  evaporate  and 
thermally expand, maintaining a relatively constant diameter [24] .

Once a ﬂame is initiate, heat diffuses from the ﬂame to the droplet 
causing vaporization while gaseous fuel diffuses from the droplet 
to the ﬂame front, driven by concentration gradients. External to 
the ﬂame, the oxidizer diffuses to the ﬂame front while products 
diffuse away from the ﬂame, both also via concentration gradients. 
This  is  generally  referred  to  as  the  two-ﬁlm  model  [37 , 58 , 223] . 
Heavier fuels tend to vaporize more slowly than lighter ones [223] . 
Turbulence enhances mixing and diffusion processes and is present 
in most practical combustion systems, enhancing combustion and 
reducing  pollutants.  While  single  droplet  combustion  is  not  the 
dominant combustion mode in practical applications, it does oc- 
cur in the case of larger rogue droplets that can escape combus- 
tor  streamlines  and  even  impinge  combustor  walls.  These  rogue 
droplets are important because they can be responsible for a sig- 
niﬁcant proportion of UHC emissions and coke/char deposits [24] . 
The number of these larger droplets should be minimal with ef- 
ﬁcient atomization, but sprays form a wide range of droplet sizes 
with some inevitably falling into this upper size range. 

FPBOs,  nonetheless,  undergo  different  combustion  processes 
than  conventional  fossil  oils  due  to  their  chemical  composition 
24 , 121 , 224–227 ].  Therefore,  understanding  the  combustion  char- 
acteristics  of  FPBO,  along  with  the  role  of  atomization  in  it,  is 
critical  in  order  to  design  suitable  combustors.  FPBO  requires  a 
strong ignition source, after which the fuel will burn with a sta- 
ble, self-sustaining ﬂame [38] . As a FPBO droplet enters the com- 
bustion chamber, the water and other volatile compounds (LMW 
components)  begin  to  vaporize  and  burn  with  a  quiescent  blue 
ﬂame  [24 , 227] ,  mostly  in  accordance  with  the  D 2  law  [9 , 24 , 95] . 
Some studies have reported some deviations from the D 2  model 
due to FPBO’s multi-component composition [78 , 228] . As burning 
progresses, the multi-component droplets can swell and distort as 
the HMW compounds polymerize [40 , 224 , 225 , 227] forming a skin 
along the surface of the droplet. The exterior of the droplet contin- 
uously remains near the boiling point of the external polymeriz- 
ing components which increases as lighter volatiles are vaporized. 
Beneath the droplet skin, LMW constituents continue to vaporize 
as they surpass their superheat limit, increasing the internal pres- 
sure of the droplet, which can eventually cause the skin to rup- 
ture and burn, with the subsequent residual char formation and 
burnout [24 , 121 , 227] . 

For larger droplets with high heating rates, the ﬁnal stage of the 
shell rupture may be accompanied by a sudden violent fragmen- 
tation  of  droplets  which  is  called  micro-explosion  [171 , 222 , 229] . 
The remnants of this explosion may then coalesce and again burn 
brieﬂy  with  a  blue  ﬂame  before  changing  to  a  bright  yellow 
ﬂame as CR forms and undergoes char burnout [24 , 121 , 224–227] . 
Nonetheless, the micro-explosive effects are expected to be weaker 
and less effective (if present) in practical ﬁne spray applications 
where droplet diameters are often below 100 microns [40 , 61 , 121] . 
For example, Shaddix and Hardesty suggested that in high pres- 
sure environments, applicable to gas turbines and diesel engines, 
droplet  micro-explosions  are  more  likely  to  occur,  but  with  re- 
duced intensity and effectiveness [24] . The FPBO droplet char for- 
mation and micro-explosion processes are demonstrated in Fig. 20 , 
times are not representative of actual spray combustion processes. 
The  carbonaceous  residue,  formed  through  the  above- 
mentioned  processes,  comes  from  the  non-distillable  portion 
of FPBO and only burns along the surface rather than on a volu- 
metric basis, so combustion is much slower (potentially only 10% 
of the rate of volumetric combustion [58 , 92] ) and requires longer 
combustor  residence  times  for  complete  oxidation.  The  CR  can 
contain about half of the fuel’s original carbon content and its size 
is comparable to that of the original fuel droplet, emphasizing the 
importance of effective fuel atomization prior to combustion (for 
having  high  droplet  heating  rate  and  rapid  particle  burnout)  in 
order to prevent the fuel’s polymerization and subsequently utilize 

its full energy potential [8 , 76 , 230] . In general, the CR amounts are 
mainly dependent on the fuel’s initial feedstock, carbon content, 
processing, atomization and heating rates [60 , 76 , 120 , 121] . Insuﬃ- 
cient or incomplete burnout of CR causes an increase in PM and 
gaseous emissions, as well as coke/char deposits [24 , 63] . Ideally, 
the  ﬁnal  char  burnout  phase  should  encompass  only  very  ﬁne 
particulates,  assuming  there  has  been  effective  atomization,  so 
that only ash remains. For comparison purposes, FPBO and heavy 
fossil oil can both result in PM emissions of char and ash, while 
diesel fuel tends to form neither, as diesel fuel’s PM emissions are 
comprised of soot. 

Some studies have found that FPBO and diesel have comparable 
overall individual droplet burning times [38 , 227] , while other stud- 
ies have found that diesel burns at a rate of more than twice that 
of FPBO due to FPBO’s higher density and slower vaporization as a 
result of the water’s high latent heat of vaporization value [24 , 95] . 
In those studies, higher FPBO water content increased the dispar- 
ity in droplet burning rates [24] . Higher ambient oxygen concen- 
trations increased pyrolysis oil burning rates, but the combustion 
processes themselves were unchanged [227] . Some of the dispar- 
ity between studies may have resulted from experimental proce- 
dural differences, such as the droplet heating rate and tempera- 
ture which can have exponential effects on chemical kinetics, but 
the main difference was likely that the overall burning time in- 
corporated the effect of droplet micro-explosions while the burn- 
ing rate looked at surface regression prior to micro-explosions. One 
additional study found that the best pyrolysis oils combusted with 
a better mass consumption (shorter droplet lifetime without cok- 
ing) and heat release rate than diesel, though other FPBOs were far 
worse, varying signiﬁcantly with micro-explosive effects as a result 
of fuel’s feedstock, processing, and thus its physicochemical prop- 
erties [95 , 228] . 

Many different compositional factors affect the micro-explosive 
behavior  of  FPBO. Water  content  tends  to  have  a  dual  effect  on 
the  occurrence  of  micro-explosions;  it  delays  their  onset  due  to 
longer droplet surface devolatilization, but also ampliﬁes the ex- 
plosive intensity due to water’s high vapor pressure [24 , 88 , 95 , 228] . 
Conversely, the addition of volatile compounds, such as an alco- 
hol  like  methanol,  will  speed  up  the  onset  of  micro-explosions, 
but then decrease the effectiveness of droplet fragmentation un- 
less  water  is  also  added  [24 , 88] .  Early  and/or  ineffective  micro- 
explosions lengthen the fuel droplet’s sooty burnout phase and in- 
crease the formation of particulate matter [95] . In addition, it has 
been found that the presence of char in the fuel speeds up micro- 
explosive behavior during combustion by providing heterogeneous 
nucleation sites, allowing for increased vaporization at lower tem- 
peratures and higher pressurization of the trapped volatile com- 
ponents. However the earlier onset of micro-explosions again re- 
duces the effectiveness of the fragmentation [88 , 95] . Regardless of 
its effect on micro-explosions, the presence of char in the fuel is 
decidedly negative overall [88] . 

A more recent study with methanol found that it delayed FPBO 
micro-explosions and slightly increased the frequency of their oc- 
currence [7] . This study utilized a different methodology; using an 
inert atmosphere, larger droplets, lower temperatures and higher 
methanol  concentrations  which  could  all  have  potentially  con- 
tributed to the differing results. The same study then explored the 
effect of solid char content within the fuel and determined that 
it had a direct effect on droplet micro-explosions, causing them to 
occur sooner and more frequently with higher char concentrations, 
though the effect was not correlated to heterogeneous nucleation. 
Adding  activated  charcoal  to  completely  ﬁltered  pyrolysis  liquid 
had no effect on micro-explosion frequency which it should have 
had if its main function was to provide nucleation sites. Instead, it 
is theorized that the ﬁltered solids and HMW components are re- 
quired to form an effective polymer shell to facilitate the droplet

pressurization and subsequent rapid expansion of the volatile core, 
observed  as  micro-explosions  [7] .  Weak  micro-explosions  were 
also observed in FPBO emulsions with diesel where biofuel concen- 
trations were as low as 5%. At higher FPBO concentrations, explo- 
sion intensity increased and fragmentation occurred sooner [224] . 
Finally, pyrolysis oils with less severe cracking during production 
had earlier and less violent/effective micro-explosions, leading to 
a slower burnout with more coking and sooting. This is believed 
to be due to the lower water and higher oxygen content of such 
FPBOs [38 , 95 , 228] . 

Overall, micro-explosions offer a convenient mechanism for sec- 
ondary  atomization  of  droplets  with  which  the  combustion  and 
FPBO  burnout  can  be  improved.  Even  the  studies  showing  the 
slower droplet burning rates of FPBOs compared to their petroleum 
counterparts note that micro-explosions can reduce FPBO droplet 
lifetimes below that of fossil oil droplets [95] . However, droplets 
in practical spray combustion devices have a greater tendency to 
undergo group vaporization and combustion, reducing heat trans- 
fer rates and reducing the likelihood of micro-explosions occurring 
[24 , 40] . For example, an in situ, in-ﬂame imaging of combusting 
pyrolysis oil droplets produced by an air-assist atomizer showed 
low frequency of micro-explosions [80 , 231] . Studies have yet to vi- 
sually conﬁrm the occurrence of droplet micro-explosions in prac- 
tical FPBO spray combustion applications [63] . 

5.2. FPBO spray combustion 

FPBO  spray  typically  undergoes  the  following  combustion 
stages: (1) Evaporation and combustion of LMW volatile compo- 
nents, including the evaporation of water, alongside the thermal 
cracking and gasiﬁcation of HMW components, and subsequently 
(2) the combustion of HMW components and the burnout of non- 
volatile components, such as char [63 , 121 , 131 , 136 , 232] . The second 
combustion  stage  gives  FPBO  its  unique  appearance  as  the  non- 

Fig.  21.  A  100%  FPBO  ﬂame  from  an  internally  mixed  air-blast  nozzle  with  a 
methane/oxygen pilot ﬂame. Reprinted from [69] with permission of Elsevier. 

volatile  PM  undergoes  slow  heterogeneous  surface  combustion, 
emerging  from  the  ﬂame  as  luminous  streaks  [71]  as  shown  in 
Fig. 21 . The second combustion stage requires longer hot-zone res- 
idence times for complete combustion or CO, UHC and PM emis- 
sions will increase. As discussed in Section 5.1 , the formation of 
non-volatile char during FPBO spray combustion can be suppressed 
with the formation of small droplets (from effective atomization) 
and  with  high  heating  rates  (due  to  ﬁner  droplets  and/or  hot- 
ter ﬂame/combustor), which reduces the time for chemical reac- 
tions (polymerization) inside the droplets during their ﬂight in the 
combustor [60 , 76 , 102 , 120 , 121 , 156] . However, when FPBO is heated 
above 150 °C, it begins to coke which can form harmful combustor 
or nozzle deposits and contribute to emissions [149] . 

FPBO’s unique properties, such as high viscosity and low volatil- 
ity, result in a narrower range of stable operating conditions (e.g., 
equivalence  ratio  and  power  output),  and  poorer  fuel/air  mixing 

M. Broumand, S. Albert-Green and S. Yun et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 79 (2020) 100834

than fossil oils [63 , 154 , 155] . FPBO requires ﬁner atomization com- 
pared  to  fossil  oils  for  an  equivalent  operational  eﬃciency  and 
droplet lifetime. FPBO droplets have to be 3–6 times smaller than 
a kerosene droplet for complete combustion in a generic station- 
ary  gas  turbine  which  has  a  combustor  residence  time  of  about 
10 ms (3–5 ms for an aero turbine) [154 , 155] , again illustrating the 
importance of proper FPBO atomization. A 100 micron droplet of 
kerosene can burn in 3 ms, while a heavier fuel (“Pool Fuel Oil”
with a residual residue comparable to FPBO) would require 15 ms 
to burn. Similarly, for complete combustion within a 10 ms resi- 
dence time, kerosene droplets can be as large as 200 microns while 
the heavier fuel droplets cannot be larger than 75 microns in diam- 
eter [155] . A separate numerical analysis showed that a 50 micron 
FPBO droplet requires a 60% longer residence time for combustion 
than conventional fuels, conﬁrming the increased spray penetra- 
tion of FPBO and also reinforcing the importance of ﬁne fuel atom- 
ization [79] . Bigger fuel droplets and/or solid particulates can also 
escape streamlines, recirculation zones and ﬂames regions prior to 
burnout, forming deposits and emissions, lowering combustion ef- 
ﬁciency and causing erosion and corrosion [154] . In addition, over- 
penetration can cause fuel to contact combustor surfaces leading 
to quenching which greatly reduces combustion eﬃciency and in- 
creases emissions [58] . 

FPBO ﬂames are usually of comparable or greater length than 
conventional  fossil  oils,  but  the  ﬂame  length  is  dependent  on  a 
number of variables including atomization quality, fuel ﬂow rate, 
nozzle  jet  velocity,  jet  penetration,  and  recirculation  within  the 
combustor [8 , 38 , 40 , 64 , 104 , 151 , 233] . One study suggested that with 
adequate atomization and combustion strategies, FPBO ﬂames are 
not longer than light fuel oil ﬂames, meaning that existing burner 
and combustor sizes would be acceptable [131] . In addition, FPBO 
ﬂames tend to be of an equal brightness or brighter than fossil oil 
ﬂames due to the high amounts of particulates in the FPBO ﬂame 
from polymerization [151 , 195] , but some studies have found con- 
tradictory results [63 , 92] . Brighter ﬂames can help to promote bet- 
ter fuel vaporization and burnout of the droplets which escape into 
the ﬂame-out region (prior to complete burnout) from increased 
radiation heat transfer [63 , 234] . Furthermore, the adiabatic ﬂame 
temperature of FPBO is 170 0–20 0 0 K compared to 220 0–230 0 K 
for diesel. The low stoichiometric air-to-fuel ratio of FPBO combus- 
tion (due to its high oxygen content) helps to offset the ﬂame tem- 
perature reduction caused by its high water content [8 , 24 , 38 , 48] . 

The  unfavorable  combustion  characteristics  of  FPBO  can  be 
largely attributed to its poorer ignition quality and lower cetane 
number  (higher  cetane  numbers  indicate  shorter  ignition  delays 
or an easier to ignite fuel) compared to light fuel oils. FPBO usu- 
ally  has  a  cetane  number  between  5  and  25  depending  on  the 
fuel feedstock and processing [25 , 26] . The cetane number of Ensyn 
FPBO  was measured between 19.3 and 21.9  [39] . In  comparison, 
diesel has a cetane number of about 45–50 [9 , 25 , 26 , 35 , 66] while 
heavy fuel oil has a lower cetane number of about 20–35 [66] . Hot 
ﬁltered  FPBO  (with  no  particulates)  was  found  to  have  a  higher 
cetane number of approximately 27, though it would be again de- 
pendent on the fuel feedstock and processing [38] . Ignition issues 
with FPBO occur because the LMW components that vaporize at 
low temperatures are oxygenated, so they have a low energy con- 
tent and a small heat release. In addition, the water content of the 
fuel also evaporates, absorbing a signiﬁcant portion of the available 
thermal energy [24 , 63] . The longer ignition delays of FPBO limit 
the amount of heat released near the nozzle, reducing ﬂame sta- 
bility and ﬂame seating/attachment [122] . Nonetheless, while FPBO 
is hard to ignite, it burns steadily after ignition [33 , 35 , 161 , 162] . 

Combustion testing using aged FPBO (stored at 20 °C) examined 
how combustion quality via emissions changes with fuel quality 
[110] . In general, trends showed that during combustion, fuel aging 
causes CO, UHC and PM emissions to increase slowly within the 

ﬁrst three months and then to increase quickly afterwards with up 
to nine months of aging. The next set of experiments, conducted 
with FPBO aged for 24 months, found extremely poor fuel qual- 
ity (very high amounts of solids and non-volatile fuel residue) and 
combustion quality (very high PM emissions and large ﬂame in- 
stabilities) compared to initial baseline (non-aged) conditions. To 
ensure  effective  combustion,  aging  reactions  must  be  prevented, 
and FPBO should always be well mixed before use to ensure ho- 
mogeneity and that heavier elements have not settled at the bot- 
tom of the fuel tank, affecting viscosity [136 , 232 , 235] . The study’s 
overall conclusion was that fuel aging greatly affects fuel quality 
and combustion performance with degradation much more severe 
for fuels with a higher initial concentration of solids. 

Despite  challenges,  ﬂames  from  FPBO  can  be  stabilized  with 
the  use  of  a  ﬂame  holder  (bluff body)  or  strong  swirl,  both  of 
which can generate centralized hot-gas recirculation zone(s), tur- 
bulence and rapid mixing. The impacts of these effects are to heat 
and  ignite  incoming  reactants,  reduce  the  local  ﬂow  velocity  to 
more closely match that of the ﬂame (reducing ﬂame shear and 
increasing  stability),  extend  the  ﬂame’s  lean  blow-out  limit,  de- 
crease  the  length  of  the  ﬂame,  seat  the  ﬂame  on  or  near  the 
nozzle,  increase  the  fuel  hot-zone  residence  time  (by  entraining 
droplets and residues) and reduce the CO, UHC and PM emissions 
[8 , 40 , 63 , 116 , 136 , 137 , 151 , 236 , 237] .  Swirl  imparts  centrifugal  forces 
on the primary combustion air entering the combustor, causing the 
primary air to move radially outwards and forming a low-pressure 
zone down the center of the combustion chamber. This low pres- 
sure zone causes hot combustion products to recirculate towards 
the ﬂame [236 , 237] . With FPBO combustion, while the central re- 
circulation zone(s) are very beneﬁcial and are often facilitated with 
the use of a hollow-cone spray nozzle, high amounts of primary air 
swirl can result in signiﬁcant coke/char formation on the external 
surface of the nozzle [146] . 

5.2.1. Strategies for FPBO combustion in burners, boilers, and furnaces 
Several  strategies  are  proposed  in  the  literature  to  address 
the  challenges  introduced  in  Section  3.1 .  Many  FPBO  burner, 
boiler and furnace systems have twin-ﬂuid (air or steam) atom- 
izing  nozzles  with  swirling/recirculating  ﬂows  (producing  com- 
pact and intense ﬂames) to increase combustion stability and ef- 
ﬁciency [6 , 24 , 195 , 197 , 235 , 238 , 40 , 61 , 92 , 116 , 136 , 137 , 148 , 152] . Steam 
atomization with FPBO seems to reduce incidences of nozzle clog- 
ging when compared to air atomization [195] , but also introduces 
even more water into the combustion process, reducing ﬂame tem- 
peratures and further interfering with ignition so air atomization 
can  give  better  results  [136] ,  particularly  with  respect  to  ﬂame 
stability [239] . For twin-ﬂuid systems, high air/steam atomization 
pressure improves the spray quality and reduces emissions, notably 
CO and PM, but only up to a certain point [92 , 116 , 152] . Above this 
point, ﬂame instabilities and blow-out are likely to occur from high 
shear rates. Despite the advantages of twin-ﬂuid nozzles, pressure 
atomization is still the most common burner atomization method 
overall, especially with lighter fuel oils, though results with FPBO 
have been mixed [8 , 9 , 40 , 48 , 92 , 116 , 201 , 232] . An important concern 
with using pressure atomization with FPBO is that solids within 
the  fuel  and/or  from  polymerization  can  clog  the  small  internal 
passageways required to generate the high pressure necessary for 
good spray quality. 

The fuel nozzle is particularly prone to blockages and clogging 
due to its narrow geometry and its susceptibility is high during 
shut-down when the fuel is no longer ﬂowing but the combustion 
environment is still hot and radiative heat transfer from the noz- 
zle’s surroundings is high. This can easily heat the stagnant FPBO 
sitting in the nozzle enough to cause rapid aging, polymerization 
and clogging [24 , 108 , 131 , 136 , 137 , 232] . To prevent this, the injec- 
tion system should be ﬂushed with an appropriate solvent, such 

26

as ethanol, after every use [24 , 61 , 92 , 104 , 108 , 131 , 152 , 197 , 232 , 235] . 
Mineral  oil  can  also  be  used  for  ﬂushing,  but  was  shown  to  be 
far  less  effective  [108] .  Furthermore,  ﬂushing  can  be  done  prior 
to combustion extinguishment, provided the ﬂuid can be burned 
cleanly [137 , 152 , 235] . When the fuel has a high solids content, char 
accumulation can also clog the nozzle, in which case a larger ex- 
ternal  nozzle-exit  may  be  required  (adversely  affecting  atomiza- 
tion  [58] ).  Alternatively,  in-line  fuel  ﬁltering  or  solvent  blending 
can be a solution [24 , 92 , 116 , 136 , 137 , 147 , 195 , 235] . In one test cam- 
paign, the use of unﬁltered FPBO resulted in large pumping pres- 
sure ﬂuctuations, preventing stable combustion, which was solved 
by using a 35 micron fuel ﬁlter [232] . Another study used a 45 
micron fuel ﬁlter and had no issues throughout a lengthy testing 
regime  [136] .  The  best  long-term  solution  would  be  to  improve 
FPBO quality by reducing the solids content as solids only nega- 
tively impact the fuel and combustion process and emissions. The 
nozzle and injection system are also quite susceptible to corrosion, 
requiring the use of stainless steel components or compatible plas- 
tics where direct contact with the fuel occurs (i.e. on all wetted 
parts) [8 , 24 , 38 , 63] . 

Poor  ignition  quality,  especially  when  starting  the  combus- 
tor  or  when  using  low  quality  FPBO,  can  be  managed  through 
initial  heating  with  conventional  fuels,  beginning  FPBO  com- 
bustion  when  the  system  is  between  500  and  800  °C,  and/or 
through  the  use  of  pilot  fuels/ﬂames,  fuel  blending  or  co-ﬁring 
[4 , 24 , 137 , 148 , 149 , 197 , 232 , 235 , 33 , 40 , 61 , 92 , 94 , 104 , 131 , 136] .  If  using 
a  dual-fuel  burner,  preheating with  conventional fuels  is  recom- 
mended and when the FPBO stream is initiated, the original ﬂame 
can  be  used  as  a  pilot  until  stability  is  reached  and  the  system 
can  be  operated  solely  on  FPBO  [149] .  Once  stable  combustion 
is  achieved  with  a  high  combustor  temperature,  the  pilot  ﬂame 
tends to have only a minimal effect [151 , 152] , assuming heat losses 
are  small  (not  always  the  case  with  small  lab-scale  combustors 
[63 , 102] ).  Radiative  heating,  for  example  from  a  combustor’s  re- 
fractory (insulative) lining, and hot-gas recirculation can be used 
to heat the incoming fuel and to increase the ﬂame temperature, 
improving fuel vaporization and ignition which helps to stabilize 
the ﬂame and offset the effects of the fuel’s high water content 
[8 , 24 , 40 , 131 , 136 , 149] . One study used an insulated radiating sheet 
metal insert, heated via light fuel oil, to similarly improve ignition 
[232] . Finally, spark igniters have also been used occasionally for 
ignition [40 , 61 , 149] . Heating the primary combustion air to a tem- 
perature  of  180–350  °C  also  increases  fuel  vaporization  and  the 
ﬂame temperature, promoting ignition and fuel burnout and reduc- 
ing emissions [6 , 40 , 61 , 92 , 131] . Additionally, heating the atomizing 
air, if using a twin-ﬂuid nozzle, can provide combustion beneﬁts as 
well [40] . 

Co-ﬁring FPBO with a fossil oil or coal during start-up is an- 
other method to warm up the combustor, though with lower qual- 
ity FPBOs, co-ﬁring may also be required during standard operating 
conditions  to  improve  ignition  and  combustion  [8 , 24 , 38 , 40 , 136] . 
One study [136] found high water content FPBOs (around 35 wt.%) 
had  immediately  better  ﬂame  and  combustion  stability  with  a 
heavy fuel oil support fuel supplying 25% of the burner’s energy 
throughput. No major combustion problems or combustor fouling 
occurred and with the support fuel, CO and PM emissions dropped 
along  with  a  corresponding  increase  in  NO x  emissions.  Co-ﬁring 
can stabilize and/or anchor FPBO ﬂames by enhancing ignition, re- 
sulting  in  high  combustion  eﬃciencies,  minimal  carbon  residue, 
lower emissions and reduced localized extinguishment. Successful 
co-ﬁring tests have already been conducted with 65% FPBO in stan- 
dard oil burners and with 80% FPBO following some modiﬁcations 
to allow for a pilot ﬂame or primary air preheating [4 , 8 , 9 , 40 , 64 , 68] . 
A major advantage with co-ﬁring is that few modiﬁcations are gen- 
erally required (and hence a lower capital investment is needed) 
to function with FPBO [8 , 9 , 40 , 64 , 68] . In addition, coal co-ﬁring can 

be combusted with the full char content of FPBO (increasing the 
fuel yield from the feedstock) [68] . Furthermore, tests in a 600 kW 
boiler with 66% FPBO, 17% ethanol and 17% natural gas generated 
stable, high eﬃciency combustion without fuel or air preheating, 
beneﬁcial for on-demand applications. Emissions were also similar 
to diesel operation [116] . 

With  proper  atomization, carbon  residues  and deposition  can 
be minimized and when combined with a suﬃcient residence time 
for the non-volatile fuel components, complete fuel burnout can 
be achieved. For these combustion systems, proper atomization re- 
quires  in-line  fuel  preheating  between  40  and  90  °C  or  10  and 
15% solvent addition (depending on the speciﬁc FPBO’s properties) 
to reduce the fuel viscosity to within the recommended range of 
4–25cSt  [6 , 24 , 235 , 40 , 92 , 131 , 136 , 148 , 149 , 152 , 232] .  While  adequate 
residence times will allow for complete carbon burnout, the inher- 
ent ash content within the fuel will still always cause particulate 
emissions and surface deposits since the ash will not react or burn. 
In addition, if ﬂames or liquid fuel contact combustor surfaces, cok- 
ing/char formation can occur very rapidly, increasing PM emissions 
due to quenching [136] . Furthermore, if fuel preheating is too high, 
above 80–90 °C, in addition to polymerization, fuel boiling within 
the nozzle of the LMW components (i.e., ﬂash atomization) can oc- 
cur, creating major instabilities from high intermittent shear rates 
and resulting in a pulsating ﬂame [4 , 24 , 40 , 110] . Alcohol/solvent ad- 
dition improves combustion stability due to rapid vaporization and 
heat release directly below the nozzle, increasing NO x  emissions, 
but reducing PM emissions; water addition has the opposite effect 
[40 , 61 , 136 , 137] . 

Concerning  the  FPBO  emissions,  with  complete  combustion 
from  good  atomization,  adequate  hot-zone  residence  time  and 
proper  mixing,  low  CO  values  (though  still  usually  above  those 
of  light  fuel  oils)  can  be  achieved  with  negligible  UHC  emis- 
sions  [63 , 92 , 136 , 148 , 152 , 232] .  SO x  are  usually  low  or  negligible 
since  FPBO  has  near-zero  sulfur  content  [8 , 14 , 128 , 129 , 147 , 148] . 
Studies  indicate  that  NO x  emissions  from  FPBO  are  mainly  the 
result  of  fuel-bound  nitrogen,  and  so  they  are  feedstock  de- 
pendent  [6 , 24 , 195 , 232 , 235 , 63 , 104 , 126 , 131 , 137 , 149 , 151 , 152] ,  with  a 
lesser contribution from thermal NO x because the fuel’s water con- 
tent reduces combustion temperatures [235] . NO x formation from 
heavy  fuel  oil  is  also  mainly  from  fuel-bound  nitrogen  (though 
higher  ﬂame  temperatures  allow  for  more  thermal  NO x  forma- 
tion)  while  light  oil  emissions  are  mainly  from  thermal  NO x 
[24 , 63 , 131 , 136 , 151 , 235] .  The  ash  and  solids  content  of  FPBO  can 
vary widely and therefore so too can the PM emissions because 
they  are  closely  related  [131 , 235] .  PM  emissions  can  be  higher 
than  those  from  heavy  fuel  oils  and  are  almost  always  greater 
than those from light fuel oils [92 , 136 , 148 , 149 , 232] . Complete char 
burnout can be achieved, giving rise to PM emissions comprised al- 
most completely of ash [6 , 104 , 136 , 235] . Consequently, the removal 
of solids and ash during FPBO production is very important and 
it is recommended to keep the fuel’s organic solids content below 
0.1 wt.% and the inorganic solids (ash) content below 0.03 wt.% in 
order to minimize PM emissions as well as the potential for clog- 
ging, corrosion and erosion [8 , 33 , 40] . Testing has shown that FPBO 
emissions from commercial applications can be odor free [23] . 

5.2.2. Strategies for FPBO combustion in gas turbine engines 

There  exist  several  strategies  to  address  the  challenges  (see 
Section  3.2 )  associated  with  the  use  of  FPBO  in  gas  turbine  en- 
gines.  Similar  to  other  applications,  the  poor  ignition  character- 
istics  of  FPBO  can  be  improved  with  air  preheating  at  tempera- 
tures of at least 80 °C or with the use of a secondary/pilot fuel 
to  warm  up  the  engine,  often  done  with  diesel  or  another  fuel 
oil [9 , 24 , 38 , 62 , 100 , 101 , 157 , 159] . As in other applications, running 
in  a  dual-fuel  mode  during  regular  operation  can  help  to  miti- 
gate  the  challenges  of  using  FPBO  [157] .  Fuel  preheating  of  50–

90 °C can also enhance ignition quality by reducing viscosity (with 
or without solvent/alcohol addition [9 , 48 , 157] ) and improve atom- 
ization, fuel burnout and emissions. The maximum fuel viscosity 
allowing for effective spray formation in gas turbines is believed 
to be around 7cSt [9 , 10 , 33 , 60 , 93 , 100 , 156] , but some studies have 
run  gas  turbines  at  partial  loads  with  FPBO  viscosity  as  high  as 
12cSt utilizing fuel ﬁltering, a diesel pilot fuel and FPBO preheating 
[157] . Above the recommended fuel viscosity, one study found that 
poorer spray quality was evident, based upon delayed breakup and 
the observed presence of ligaments, using a pressure-swirl (sim- 
plex) atomizer and concluded that because of the high viscosity 
of FPBOs, twin-ﬂuid nozzles should instead be used in gas turbine 
engines [93] . A second study found that pressure atomization with 
FPBO was feasible when preheated because the spray Sauter Mean 
Diameter  (SMD)  could  be  brought  below  50  microns  [9 , 48] .  An- 
other study [156] in a micro gas turbine found a linear correlation 
between fuel dynamic viscosity and CO emissions for vegetable oil 
and biodiesel combustion; the study was designed to be a precur- 
sor for FPBO experiments in a gas turbine engine. 

One of the principle concerns with respect to the use of FPBO in 
gas turbine engines is the propensity for incomplete combustion, 
elevated emissions and fuel residues due to short residence times. 
To reduce PM emissions, fuel residue deposits and fuel solids, in- 
line  FPBO  ﬁltering  should  be  used  [9 , 62 , 157] .  Typically,  turbines 
operated on FPBO have increased CO, UHC and PM emissions com- 
pared  to  conventional  fuels  [24 , 96 , 157] ,  but  have  similar  or  re- 
duced  NO x  emissions  [38 , 62 , 96 , 157]  and  have  lower  SO x  emis- 
sions [38 , 96] . The exhaust can also have a distinct odor [157] . In 
numerous studies, often of short-term duration, post-combustion 
fuel  residue  deposits  were  found  on  the  nozzle,  combustor  lin- 
ing and blade surfaces along the hot gas path [24 , 38 , 96 , 157] . One 
study  [96]  described  the  deposits  as  a  light-brown,  ﬁne  powder 
with moderate surface adhesion and reduced accumulation down- 
stream of the combustor. Another study showed that the deposits 
could  be  burned  off with  fossil  oils  while  a  second  study  indi- 
cated  otherwise,  ﬁnding  that  mechanical  removal  was  required 
[9 , 116 , 157] which would likely be the case if deposits were signif- 
icantly comprised of non-combustible ash. Alternatively, a turbine 
wash system utilizing an abrasive medium could be developed for 
use during engine operation, as described in two separate studies 
[101 , 158] . Reducing FPBO residue is important for feasibility mov- 
ing forward given the engine’s high-speed operation, and thus its 
susceptibility to damage [38] . Given the absence of long-term test- 
ing, additional studies are required in order to determine overall 
system durability and reliability. Furthermore, to address material 
incompatibility,  stainless  steel  or  Teﬂon  components  and/or  sur- 
face coatings should be used for the injection system, combustion 
chamber, turbine blades and other hot sections where direct con- 
tact with the FPBO and its exhaust (including PM) are unavoidable 
[9 , 33 , 96 , 101] . For gas turbine engines, FPBO ﬂame stabilization has 
been achieved, for example, using opposing jets in scaled combus- 
tors, and with radial swirl in full-sized turbines [60] . 

5.2.3. Strategies for FPBO combustion in compression-ignition engines 
Several  strategies  are  also  proposed  in  the  literature  to  ad- 
dress the challenges (see Section 3.3 ) associated with the use of 
FPBO  in  compression-ignition  engines.  FPBO  ignition  quality  and 
stability  can  be  enhanced  through  physically  changing  the  fuel 
using blending, emulsiﬁcation and cetane-improvers, although all 
three incur added fuel costs and both cetane improvers and emul- 
sions  can  be  especially  costly  [38] .  The  use  of  cetane-improvers 
with FPBO has given contradictory results with some studies ﬁnd- 
ing that they worked to equalize emissions and performance be- 
tween FPBO and diesel [38 , 48 , 161] while other studies have shown 
that  cetane-improvers  have  a  minimal  effect  on  FPBO  [26 , 132] . 
FPBO/diesel emulsions result in more favorable fuel and ignition 

properties and engines require fewer modiﬁcations than when op- 
erated  on  100%  FPBO,  so  this  is  an  active  area  of  research  [33] . 
However,  some  emulsions  have  caused  more  corrosion  and  ero- 
sion, though not always the case, than 100% FPBO [21 , 38 , 240] . In- 
terestingly,  FPBO/diesel  emulsions  reportedly  caused  more  com- 
ponent damage with lower FPBO concentrations and damage de- 
creased as more FPBO was added (despite the pH value), which 
was attributed to the effects of the high-velocity high-pressure tur- 
bulent  ﬂows,  such  as  cavitation,  in  the  injection  channels  [241] . 
With regards to blending, one study [103] showed that aged FPBO 
mixed with 12 wt.% ethanol and preheated to 50 °C was enough 
to  induce  auto-ignition  within  a  5  kW  diesel  engine  (without 
ethanol  at  90  °C  ignition  failed),  but  the  engine  could  only  op- 
erate for a few minutes before failure. Furthermore, the blended 
FPBO spray SMD was about four times larger than that from diesel 
fuel. Even with these blending and emulsifying strategies, the FPBO 
ignition delays were still appreciably longer than when operating 
with diesel fuel alone, due to the poor ignition quality and lower 
cetane number of biofuels [38 , 103 , 161 , 162] . However, once ignited, 
FPBO was found to burn well, actually having a shorter duration 
(faster  heat  release  and/or  higher  ﬂame  speed)  than  diesel,  de- 
spite a longer injection period and ignition delay which then al- 
lows for a longer mixing time and forms a larger premixed frac- 
tion [55 , 66 , 103 , 132 , 161 , 162 , 164 , 165 , 168] . The longer ignition delay 
is believed to be due to the slower FPBO chemical kinetics, rather 
than physical processes, such as atomization or vaporization [164] . 
Furthermore, the inherent oxygen content within the FPBO could 
act to further increase the fuel and oxidizer premixing [132] . De- 
spite the rapid heat release from FPBO, the fuel solids and carbon 
residue  would  still  burn  more  slowly  if  present;  the  ash  within 
the fuel is not combustible. As a ﬁnal note, physically upgrading 
the FPBO via hot ﬁltering reduced ignition delay and coke/char de- 
posits and resulted in faster burning because of the fuel’s lower 
molecular weight, solids content and water content [38] . 

Rather  than  modifying  the  FPBO,  ignition  challenges  can  be 
overcome by adjusting the design and operation strategies of the 
engine. One of the simplest ways to aid FPBO ignition is through 
air preheating between 55 and 150 °C to increase combustion tem- 
peratures [25 , 26 , 35 , 38 , 40 , 163 , 164] and the use of 130 °C air pre- 
heating has been shown to equalize FPBO and diesel ignition de- 
lays [24] . Eﬃcient combustion can be diﬃcult without inlet air pre- 
heating, but once the cylinder temperature is suﬃcient for proper 
ignition, higher air temperatures will not be very beneﬁcial and a 
corresponding increase in thermal NO x formation will occur [25] . 
In addition, pyrolysis oils require preheating, up to 90 °C, for ig- 
nition  in  diesel  engines  to  improve  atomization  (through  lower 
viscosity) [8 , 9] , but a lower fuel temperature and less preheating, 
closer to the injector, is better to avoid or reduce fuel polymer- 
ization and degradation [56] . Another method to improve ignition 
is by increasing the compression ratio of the engine, which also 
serves  to  increase  the  mixture  temperature  within  the  combus- 
tor; higher pressures and temperatures both increase reaction rates 
[26 , 47 , 55] . Higher compression ratios can signiﬁcantly reduce the 
required amount of air preheating [35] with one study ﬁnding a 
compression ratio increase from 17.6 to 22.4 reduced the necessary 
air inlet preheating from around 100 °C to 60 °C [26] . Additionally, 
increased  compression  ratios  decreased  CO  emissions,  but  were 
found to only have a minimal effect on NO x emissions [26] . Given 
that chemical reaction rates increase exponentially with temper- 
ature, any of these methods apart or in combination can have a 
signiﬁcant effect on ignition rates and combustion. Finally, proper 
atomization is still critical because larger fuel droplets increase ig- 
nition delay times and lead to quenching and deposition on the 
combustion cylinder walls [47] . 

Initiating  combustion  from  a  cold-start  is  often  not  possible 
with FPBO given its poor ignition properties so conventional fuels 

28

are often used. The simplest method is using a secondary fuel at 
start-up and then when hot, switching the engine to FPBO with al- 
cohols facilitating the change-over [25 , 26 , 55] . Alternatively, pilot or 
dual injection with fuel oils, such as diesel or heavier fuels, can be 
used to initiate proper FPBO ignition and combustion on cold start- 
up [25 , 26 , 162 , 164 , 165 , 35 , 38 , 40 , 55 , 66 , 112 , 132 , 161] . This second ap- 
proach  allows  for  the  use  of  a  high  percentage  of  FPBO  (above 
90 wt.%) while maintaining similar engine eﬃciencies to diesel op- 
eration [242] , but modiﬁcations can be costly [55] . Furthermore, 
pilot or dual injection conﬁgurations reduce the sensitivity to FPBO 
injection, creating a more robust system [66] . 

Corrosion  and/or  erosion  are  signiﬁcant  concerns  within  a 
diesel engine operated on FPBO, but with suﬃcient modiﬁcations, 
the  injection  system  and  overall  engine  can  be  protected  from 
damage [26 , 55 , 132] . To prevent corrosion, fuel wetted engine com- 
ponents must be upgraded to stainless steel or a compatible poly- 
mer for seals, such as Teﬂon [8 , 25 , 26 , 38 , 40 , 55 , 56 , 105 , 132 , 168] . Ero- 
sion,  from  solid  particles  (char  and  ash)  within  the  fuel,  causes 
wear  on  the  injection  system  and  is  best  alleviated  through  a 
reduction  in  the  fuel’s  solid  content  via  in-line  fuel  ﬁltration 
[8 , 33 , 38 , 164] . A surface treatment (or coating) to provide wear re- 
sistance against abrasives or to reduce friction in order to protect 
against  engine  seizing  has  also  been  used  [25 , 132] .  It  is  recom- 
mended that solid particulates in the fuel be below 10–15 microns 
in size [114] . After one hour of operation with FPBO, the external 
oriﬁce cross-sectional area of a standard engine injector increased 
by 48%, leading to poor atomization and increased emissions and 
fuel consumption. The same study found that a stainless steel in- 
jector  performed  well  with  a  constant  injection  pressure  during 
more  than  an  hour  of  testing  and  showed  no  visual  damage  or 
change  in  oriﬁce  dimensions  after  four  hours  of  continuous  op- 
eration [25] . This 20 kW engine accumulated 12 hours (including 
eight hours of continuous operation before the injector failed) of 
operation during one test on 100% FPBO [25] and 40 hours of op- 
eration (a couple hours of continuous operation per day) during a 
second test which used a newly designed injector with no failures 
or visual damage on the injector after testing was complete [26] . 
Both  experiments  showed  stable  fuel  consumption  and  emission 
trends during testing [25 , 26] . 

Clogging  of  the  injection  system  (i.e.  the  injector)  or  the 
pump  can  be  remedied,  and  generalized  coke/char  deposits  re- 
moved,  by  using  ethanol  (or  methanol),  usually  with  cetane 
enhancers,  to  ﬂush  the  system  repeatedly  during  operation 
[25 , 26 , 55 , 105 , 161 , 162 , 164 , 168] or problems can be mediated with 
in-line fuel ﬁltering [47 , 164] . Filtering also helps to reduce compo- 
nent  wear  (due  to  erosion  and  abrasion)  and  the  risk  of  engine 
seizure  [132] .  In  addition,  both  the  injection  and  pumping  sys- 
tems have small clearances so fuel ﬁltering down to 10 microns 
is recommended [66] and to remove solids, in-line ﬁltering is pre- 
ferred over pre-ﬁltering [105] , although one study used both: 10 
micron pre-ﬁltering in the supply tank along with a 40 micron in- 
line ﬁlter [164] . This study had maximum continuous run times 
of about six hours before the injection and pumping systems re- 
quired repairs, though typical run times were around three hours 
(followed by maintenance) to ensure consistent data. Furthermore, 
some studies suggest that FPBO ﬁltering should be a requirement 
prior to use in compression-ignition engines to remove ash, char 
and other solids [56] . Injector clogging can quickly occur shortly 
after shutdown due to the polymerization of stagnant fuel, but this 
can potentially be prevented with water-cooled injectors, allowing 
for rapid temperature reductions after operation [66] . Finally, to re- 
move coke/char deposit build-up, the combustion system can also 
be ﬂushed with diesel fuel instead of, or in conjunction with, alco- 
hol [56] . 

A  large  majority  of  studies  indicated  that  FPBO  op- 
eration  in  diesel  engines  creates  CO  and  UHC  emissions 

However, 

(though  few  studies  actually  measured  UHC  emissions)  sim- 
ilar  or  higher  than  during  diesel  operation  due,  at  least  in 
part,  to  poorer  combustion  and  incomplete  char  burnout 
[24 , 25 , 168 , 169 , 26 , 48 , 63 , 112 , 114 , 132 , 161 , 162] . 
these 
emissions  can  be  mitigated  with  the  use  of  a  post-combustion 
oxidizing catalyst, especially because FPBO has a negligible sulfur 
content  which  could  otherwise  poison  catalysts,  but  care  must 
be taken to prevent clogging from ash or char particulate matter 
[56 , 114 , 132 , 242] .  Conversely,  FPBO  NO x  emissions  were  typically 
lower  than  during  diesel  operation  (up  to  50%  less)  because  of 
lower  thermal  NO x  formation  as  a  result  of  lower  temperatures 
and  longer  ignition  delays  which  reduced  the  time  for  NO x  for- 
mation to actually occur [25 , 26 , 56 , 112 , 114 , 132 , 168 , 169] . Upgraded 
FPBO  showed  the  same  emission  trends  with  respect  to  diesel 
as crude FPBO [112] . Higher engine loads would tend to increase 
NO x  emissions  and  decrease  CO  and  UHC  emissions  as  cylinder 
temperatures  and  combustion  eﬃciencies  increase  [25 , 105] .  No 
studies  quantifying  soot  or  PM  emissions  from  diesel  engines 
operated  with  FPBO  were  found  [55] ,  though  studies  looking  at 
visual  smoke  indicators  gave  varying  and  inconsistent  results 
[55 , 66 , 103 , 161 , 162 , 242] . 

An engine powered by FPBO should allow for easy maintenance 
and be equipped with either a zero-spill injector or a diverter line 
so as not to reintroduce heated FPBO back into the fuel tank due to 
the potential for aging, polymerization and the formation of solids 
[56 , 66 , 164] . One additional problem with using FPBO in diesel en- 
gines is the fuel’s incompatibility with conventional engine lubri- 
cants should they interact, for instance if the fuel spray hits the 
cylinder wall [25 , 55 , 66 , 103 , 168] . While this could potentially lead 
to engine failure, compatible lubricants or additives can likely be 
found and used, though at greater expense [103 , 164] . Additionally, 
in order to ensure that the fuel is within a suitable viscosity range 
with limited degradation prior to utilization, the engine’s fuel tank 
should be between 15 and 25 °C (cooler during long-term storage), 
mixed to prevent fuel phase separation and purged with an inert 
gas [56] . 

6. Remaining challenges and opportunities 

FPBO has recently become commercially viable, particularly in 
the boiler and furnace industries as a replacement for light and 
heavy  fuel  oils  and  several FPBO  facilities are  currently  in  oper- 
ation. Meanwhile, FPBO’s use in systems conventionally designed 
for lighter fuel oils, such as power generating compression-ignition 
and gas turbine engines, is currently still in research and devel- 
opment,  but  is  progressing.  Any  application  of  FPBO  as  a  trans- 
port fuel will likely require signiﬁcant upgrading and is still in an 
early  research  phase,  but  in  other  applications,  alcohol  blending 
has  shown  promise  as  a  "middle-ground"  option  [48 , 137] .  In  all 
applications, material compliance and long-term reliability of de- 
vices running on FPBO are important [40] . More long-term com- 
bustion testing is still required [33] with an emphasis needed on 
atomization due to its importance and the fuel’s unique physico- 
chemical properties [151] , but emissions can usually be brought to 
within acceptable levels after combustion systems are optimized 
[8 , 24 , 38 , 40 , 149] .  For  example,  NOx  and  PM  emissions  could  be 
controllable using staged combustion, low-NOx burners, or other 
similar approaches [7 , 34 , 77 , 99 , 111 , 182 , 215] . Alternative combustion 
concepts like ﬂameless combustion (FC), or the use of exhaust gas 
recirculation (EGR) or low temperature combustion (LTC) strategies 
have  yet  to  be  employed  for  improving  FPBO  combustion  [243–
245] . 

• Burners,  boilers,  and  furnaces:  These  systems  are  very 
amenable to the use of FPBO because of their long residence 
times. The use of FPBO for power generation in boiler appli-

29 

cations  is  possible  with  only  minor  modiﬁcations  to  existing 
infrastructure [35 , 38] since FPBO shares many similarities with 
heavy fuel oils which are often used in systems producing more 
than 1 MW of energy [149] . In fact, small-scale research com- 
bustors have demonstrated excellent results, so larger industrial 
facilities should be able to perform at high eﬃciencies without 
issue and with a very minimal use of secondary fuels. As men- 
tioned in Section 1 , Ensyn and Fortum have recently built or 
converted (from fossil oils) facilities for heat and/or power gen- 
eration from FPBO. Numerous FPBO facilities for heating and/or 
power generation are currently operational in Europe and North 
America; negligible CO emissions have been reported with NO x 
emissions generally falling between light and heavy fuel oil op- 
eration  and  PM  emissions  dependent  on  the  fuel  quality.  Ig- 
nition  issues  are  eliminated  with  the  use  of  ﬂame  stabiliza- 
tion strategies, in particular primary air swirl which generates 
hot-gas  recirculation.  Cold-starts  with  FPBO  are  then  achiev- 
able  with  proper  fuel  atomization,  combustor  insulation,  air 
and  fuel  preheating  (or  alcohol  addition),  and  a  simple  pilot 
ﬂame. In addition, during steady-state operation no secondary 
fuel input should be required. Alternatively, dual-fuel operation 
(or  co-ﬁring)  can  be  used  at  start-up  or  during  steady-state, 
but should not be necessary unless working with a poor qual- 
ity FPBO. Furthermore, in-line ﬁltering is usually not required 
with standard quality FPBO, but nozzle ﬂushing after operation 
is necessary. Research in this area is still active, seeking pro- 
cess enhancements, long-term reliability, ever-increasing com- 
bustion  eﬃciencies  and  lower  emissions,  but  testing  thus  far 
has been promising and successful. 

• Gas  turbine  engines:  They  have  a  very  short  residence  time 
which  is  problematic  for  FPBO  and  system  modiﬁcations  are 
likely a necessity before using this fuel, making industrial "silo" 
combustors ideal. The FPBO should also be ﬁltered in-line prior 
to  use,  given  the  sensitivity  of  turbine  engines  to  PM.  Air 
and fuel preheating, fuel blending and/or the use of pilot fu- 
els  are  all  helpful  for  igniting  FPBO  combustion  in  gas  tur- 
bines, however more signiﬁcant ignition and operational sup- 
port may be beneﬁcial if running at lower combustion loads. 
Typically, CO, UHC and PM emissions are all higher on FPBO, 
but NO x is usually equal or lower than when operating on con- 
ventional  fuels.  In  addition,  subsystems  or  strategies  to  han- 
dle  carbon  and  ash  deposits  are  required  and  some  success- 
ful examples have been outlined. Testing has been successful 
for large-scale power generation with the Orenda turbine us- 
ing 100% FPBO which resulted in acceptable emissions and no 
component damage. Nonetheless, long-term turbine testing is 
essentially non-existent, so reliability and economic feasibility 
still need to be demonstrated. Interest in micro gas turbine op- 
eration  with  FPBO  is  growing  and  this  is  a  likely  avenue  for 
future research initiatives [9 , 40] . Small-scale gas turbine tests 
have thus far not fared very well due to their even greater resi- 
dence time restrictions and other exacerbated combustion chal- 
lenges,  making  the  role  of  adequate/proper  atomization  even 
more critical. Furthermore, past experiments have required dual 
fuel  operation,  suffered  from  high  levels  of  fuel  residue  de- 
posits, and generated low quality combustion that resulted in 
high  emissions  [9] .  Overall,  gas  turbine  engines  powered  by 
FPBO are potentially viable with further research and could be 
a valuable resource for power generation in the future. 

• Compression-ignition  engines:  FPBO  appears  to  be  better 
suited  to  low-speed  (larger)  compression-ignition  engines,  or 
perhaps medium-speed engines, given their tolerance for lower 
grade  fuels  and  their  ability  to  withstand  high  mechanical 
and  thermal  stresses  while  blended  or  otherwise  upgraded 
fuels  have  potential  for  use  in  high-speed  (smaller)  engines 
[38 , 47 , 55 , 161 , 162] .  Compression-ignition  (diesel)  engines  will 

require  system  modiﬁcations  when  switching  to  FPBO  opera- 
tion, especially with respect to the injection system, but simi- 
lar eﬃciencies can be achieved between diesel and FPBO opera- 
tion. To prevent component damage, fuel in-line ﬁltering should 
be used and intermittent ﬂushing with alcohol during opera- 
tion is also recommended. Engine ignition often requires fuel 
and air preheating along with fuel mixing/upgrading or the use 
of  diesel  pilot  injection,  however  100%  crude  FPBO  has  been 
used successfully without a pilot for limited time intervals. In 
addition, increased compression ratios are also a useful strat- 
egy  to  enhance  ignition.  In  these  engines,  FPBO  burns  faster, 
at a higher pressure and with a faster heat release than diesel 
fuel due to longer ignition delays, forming a larger premixed 
fraction.  Higher  CO  and  UHC  emissions  should  be  expected 
from  an  engine  running  on  FPBO,  but  NO x  emissions  should 
be reduced; any higher emissions can be managed effectively 
with  an  oxidizing  catalyst.  In  total,  only  about  one-quarter 
of  studies  demonstrated  successful  and  stable  engine  opera- 
tion on FPBO, so this remains an active area of research [55] . 
Work demonstrating reliable, eﬃcient and longer-term opera- 
tion, particularly continuous operation, with manageable emis- 
sions is certainly required, though testing has shown promise 
[25 , 38 , 55 , 56 , 167 , 168] . 

One  of  the  biggest  challenges  with  FPBO  combustion  is  the 
lack of standardization and consistency, especially with respect to 
solids content and viscosity to which FPBO combustion quality is 
strongly related [24 , 33–35 , 40 , 94 , 132 , 147] . It is especially important 
so that FPBO can be used in different applications regardless of the 
feedstock and process used for its preparation. An ASTM standard 
[32] is in use, but fuel speciﬁcations are very broad. Varying fuel 
quality and chemical composition results from differences in fuel 
processing and the original feedstock [38 , 147] and ultimately, the 
fuel quality has a large impact on ﬁnal emissions [136] . Fuel prop- 
erty variability, recommended to be below 10% once standardized 
[33] , necessitates some testing and minor system adjustments ev- 
ery time a new fuel batch is used, reducing economic viability and 
hindering marketplace permeation. Nonetheless, representative FP- 
BOs  have  been  researched  extensively,  general  trends  have  been 
determined and extensive progress has been made within this ﬁeld 
for a variety of applications. A general overview of the issues asso- 
ciated with the standardization of FPBO properties is provided in 
references [33 , 35] , and recommends more stringent speciﬁcations 
than those in the ASTM standard. Finally, since the legislation and 
emission limits differ from one country to another one, the emis- 
sion limits of FPBO (similar to those of the fossil oils) should be 
clearly deﬁned in the legislation of many countries [35] . 

7. Concluding remarks 

The present paper extensively reviews the ﬁeld of spray com- 
bustion of fast pyrolysis bio-oil, which is expected to play an in- 
creasingly important role in future power generation. FPBO is chal- 
lenging to atomize and combust given its unique properties, but 
signiﬁcant research has been conducted and strategies have been 
developed to facilitate the use of this type of liquid biofuel. Typi- 
cally, FPBO spray droplets are larger than those from light fuel oils, 
primarily because of FPBO’s higher viscosity, and the best methods 
to mitigate this is through preheating up to approximately 80 °C or 
blending with alcoholic solvents, both of which also improve va- 
porization and ignition. With respect to nozzle selection, internally 
mixed twin-ﬂuid nozzles are clearly best for use with FPBO. The 
reason for this is that they can utilize a prompt atomization mech- 
anism which primarily relies upon surface tension rather than vis- 
cosity, producing sprays closer in size to those of light fuel oils. 
Pressure  atomization  appears  to  be  a  poor  choice  with  FPBO  as 

30

the narrow internal passages can become clogged and the spray 
SMD is heavily dependent on viscosity, but some studies have still 
demonstrated success with these simple atomizers. 

FPBO  burns  in  two  stages  with  the  initially  burning  LMW 
volatile  components  providing  the  ﬂame  stability  and  the  later 
burning HMW components responsible for the emissions and res- 
idence time requirements. Stainless steel or other compatible ma- 
terials  should  always  be  used  for  all  wetted  components  across 
all  types  of  combustion  systems.  Like  with  non-reacting  sprays, 
during  FPBO  combustion,  twin-ﬂuid  atomization  (speciﬁcally  in- 
ternally  mixed  nozzles)  is  widely  accepted  as  the  best  nozzle 
type/atomization  method  (except  in  diesel  engines)  and  studies 
have outlined nozzle design methodologies for optimizing their use 
with  this  type  of  biofuel.  Fuel  aging  or  the  use  of  lower  qual- 
ity FPBOs can easily result in poor combustion quality, emphasiz- 
ing a need for fuel standardization, especially with respect to fuel 
solids content and viscosity, to allow for widespread use in indus- 
try. In particular, long-term testing, demonstrating reliable opera- 
tion on FPBO, is required across all industrial applications moving 
forward, though these tests are already underway in some com- 
bustion systems. Regardless, the future for FPBO is bright. Engine 
usage has shown a lot of potential and further innovation and re- 
search should enable FPBO implementation in larger, more robust, 
industrial engines in the not-too-distant future. Prior to long-term 
operation of small-scale engines on FPBO, some technical modiﬁca- 
tions for stationary systems and fuel upgrading for transportation 
applications are required. Lime kilns may also need a few technical 
modiﬁcations for running on FPBO as the ﬂame is in a direct con- 
tact with process materials. Conversely, for burner systems, small- 
scale combustors have demonstrated excellent results and further 
research will likely only contribute to incremental enhancements 
and so FPBO is ready for use at an industrial scale. Finally, more 
strategies are needed to improve the economic and environmental 
competitiveness of heat and/or power generation from FPBO rela- 
tive to fuel oil, natural gas, and coal. 

While the present review paper was focused on wood-derived 
fast pyrolysis bio-oils, viscous liquid fuels could include other feed- 
stocks such as municipal and livestock wastes, agricultural or algal 
biomass, as well as petroleum heavy oils. The research ﬁndings are, 
therefore, expected to be transferable to other analogous applica- 
tions.
