Describe the role of diffusion processes and how break-in procedures accelerate membrane activation, ensuring all explanations are strictly supported by the cited content.",
    "standard_answer": "Water uptake in PFSA membranes during break-in is governed by diffusion processes where the characteristic time constant for diffusion τ_diff = L²/D_d determines the rate of water penetration. For a state-of-the-art membrane of 15μm, this time constant would range between several seconds up to about 4 minutes, showing that thinner membranes hydrate faster due to the reduced diffusion path length, as τ_diff scales with L². However, for pristine membranes, additional processes like relaxation of polymer backbones or domain spacing could dominantly affect water uptake, resulting in an up to three order of magnitude slower transport process. Break-in procedures that utilize high humidities or liquid water accelerate activation by promoting water uptake and morphological changes. When several diffusion processes must be combined, their impact on the diffusion coefficient must be calculated, and an empirical approach using weighted time constants can simplify the calculation of water uptake increase from initial to steady-state conditions.",
