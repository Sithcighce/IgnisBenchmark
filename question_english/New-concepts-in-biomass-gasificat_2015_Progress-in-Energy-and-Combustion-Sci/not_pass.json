    "standard_answer": "Aluminosilicate sorbents achieve alkali removal to ppb levels under gasification conditions through their chemical affinity for alkali species. While the specific chemical mechanisms are not detailed in the provided citations, aluminosilicates have demonstrated this capability in gasification environments. The relationship between residual alkali concentration and condensation temperature is critical for fouling prevention. Although KCl is the most abundant alkali species in raw syngas, NaCl becomes the dominant residual alkali in cleaned gas due to its different sorption behavior. The condensation temperature decreases with lower residual NaCl concentration, ranging from 530 to 630째C depending on the specific concentration achieved. This temperature reduction means that in downstream equipment operating at typical gasification temperatures (around 800째C), the cleaned gas remains above the condensation point, preventing alkali deposition and subsequent fouling and corrosion issues that would otherwise degrade performance and damage equipment.",

Compare experimental water conversion values with thermodynamic equilibrium predictions, and explain the role of integrated catalytic filtration in optimizing thermal energy utilization.",
    "standard_answer": "The steam gasification of biomass with empirical formula C21H30O14 in the UNIQUE gasifier involves complex reactions including devolatilization, steam reforming of hydrocarbons, water-gas shift reaction, and char gasification occurring simultaneously. The catalytic filter candles integrated in the gasifier freeboard achieve remarkable tar reduction of 95% while simultaneously removing particulate matter. Experimental results show that water conversion values obtained with catalytic candles closely approach thermodynamic equilibrium predictions, indicating effective promotion of steam reforming reactions. The catalytic elements enable methane and tar steam reforming to proceed together with the water-gas shift reaction, bringing experimental water conversion remarkably close to equilibrium values. This integrated approach optimizes thermal energy utilization by enabling reforming reactions inside the gasifier vessel, utilizing thermal load provided by gasification itself, rather than requiring additional energy sources in downstream equipment. The enhancement occurs because the catalytic filtration system effectively promotes hydrocarbon reforming while maintaining high thermal efficiency through integrated hot gas cleaning.",
