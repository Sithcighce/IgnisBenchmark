    "question_text": "What is the role of the critical turbulent Karlovitz number (Kac) in distinguishing the pre-transition and post-transition regimes of monotonic MIE transition?",
    "standard_answer": "The critical turbulent Karlovitz number (Kac) demarcates the boundary between pre-transition and post-transition regimes in monotonic MIE transition. Kac is defined as the ratio of turbulent strain rate to characteristic reaction rate, representing the intensity of turbulence-chemistry interaction. In the pre-transition regime (Ka < Kac), turbulent eddies are larger than the reaction zone thickness, and the flame kernel develops similarly to laminar conditions with gradual MIET increase. The reaction zone remains intact, and flame propagation exhibits thin, wrinkled fronts. In the post-transition regime (Ka > Kac), turbulent eddies penetrate the reaction zone, causing local extinction, increased heat loss, and disrupted kernel development. This leads to distributed combustion with broken flamelets and exponential MIET rise. For methane-air mixtures, Kac ranges from 8 to 26 depending on equivalence ratio, with minimum near stoichiometric conditions due to optimal reaction rates.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "In the pre-transition when Ka < Kac, MIET increases gradually with increasing Ka, flame kernel formation is similar to that of laminar spark ignition, and 2D laser tomography images of subsequent outwardly-propagating turbulent flames show sharp fronts (thin reaction zone) [61].",
      "2": "On the other hand, in the post-transition when Ka > Kac, MIET increases abruptly with increasing Ka, flame kernel is disrupted, turbulent flames reveal and subsequent randomly-propagating distributed-like fronts with islands and/or broken flame kernels [61,64,67]."

    "question_text": "Explain the physical mechanisms behind turbulence facilitated ignition (TFI) and why it requires both large Lewis number (Le >> 1) and small spark gap (dgap < 1 mm).",
    "standard_answer": "Turbulence facilitated ignition (TFI) occurs when MIET < MIEL due to the synergistic coupling of differential diffusion and reduced heat losses. For large Lewis number (Le >> 1) mixtures, thermal diffusivity exceeds mass diffusivity, leading to preferential diffusion of heat over reactants. Turbulence enhances this effect by wrinkling the flame kernel, increasing the surface area for heat release while maintaining localized high-temperature zones that promote chain-branching reactions. Simultaneously, a small spark gap (dgap < 1 mm) minimizes heat losses to the electrodes by reducing the conductive heat transfer path. This allows the kernel to retain more energy from the spark, overcoming the quenching distance. The combination enables turbulent stretching to amplify differential diffusion benefits without excessive cooling, resulting in lower ignition energy requirements. However, at higher turbulence intensities, the dominating role of turbulent dissipation overwhelms these benefits, causing MIET to increase rapidly.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "At sufficiently large Lewis number >> 1 and small spark gap (typically less than 1 mm), turbulence facilitated ignition (TFI), where MIET < MIEL, occurs; then MIET increases rapidly at larger uʹ > uʹc because turbulence re-asserts its dominating role.",

    "standard_answer": "Experimental measurements show that the initial kernel volume at t = 0.2 ms is linearly proportional to the ignition energy (Eig), following V_kernel ∝ Eig. This relationship arises because the energy deposited by the spark is primarily converted into thermal energy to heat the gas within the kernel volume. Assuming adiabatic compression and negligible radiation losses initially, the temperature rise ΔT is proportional to Eig / (ρ * Cp * V), where ρ is density and Cp is specific heat. For successful ignition, ΔT must exceed the ignition temperature, implying V_kernel must reach a critical size corresponding to the reaction zone volume. Thus, MIEL scales with the cube of the reaction zone thickness, MIEL ∝ δ_RZ^3, as predicted by Liñán's theory. This scaling confirms that MIE is determined by the energy required to create a kernel of sufficient size to sustain flame propagation, bridging spark energy deposition with fundamental combustion length scales.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "The initial kernel volume at t = 0.2 ms is linearly proportional to the increase of Eig, suggesting that MIEL ~ δRZ^3 is a very good approximation where δRZ^3 is assumed to be comparable to the initial spark kernel volume for the single-shot mode between two electrodes.",

    "standard_answer": "The reaction zone Péclet number (PeRZ) is defined as the ratio of small-scale turbulence diffusivity to reaction zone thermal diffusivity, which effectively characterizes the competition between turbulent mixing and thermal diffusion in the flame kernel. In monotonic MIE transition, PeRZ serves as a unifying parameter because it scales the turbulent strain effects relative to the chemical reaction timescale. When PeRZ is low (indicating dominant thermal diffusion over turbulent mixing), the flame kernel develops similarly to laminar conditions, and MIET increases gradually with turbulence. As PeRZ exceeds a critical value, turbulent mixing disrupts the reaction zone structure, leading to exponential increases in MIET due to enhanced heat and mass losses. This scaling holds regardless of ignition source (electrode vs. laser), flow configuration, or fuel type because PeRZ intrinsically accounts for the turbulence-chemistry interaction, making it a universal descriptor for the transition from flamelet to distributed combustion regimes.",

    "question_text": "How do heat losses to electrodes influence laminar MIE (MIEL) and why does electrode thickness (dth) and spark gap (dgap) play critical roles?",
    "standard_answer": "Heat losses to electrodes significantly increase MIEL by dissipating energy from the spark kernel through conduction. Thicker electrodes (larger dth) have higher thermal mass and conductivity, enhancing heat sink effects and raising MIEL. For example, MIEL increases from 2 mJ at dth = 1-2 mm to 20 mJ at dth = 5 mm for methane-air mixtures. Similarly, smaller spark gaps (dgap) reduce the distance for conductive heat transfer, intensifying losses. At dgap = 0.5 mm, up to 90% of spark energy can be lost to electrodes, causing kernel quenching. The critical flame radius must exceed both the quenching distance and the thermal penetration depth into electrodes for successful ignition. Thus, optimal dgap balances reduced heat loss against practical constraints, while minimal dth minimizes parasitic cooling, directly linking electrode geometry to ignition efficiency through fundamental heat transfer principles.",
    "original_text": {

As shown in Fig. 12, they found that about 90% of the ignition energy supplied was lost at the case of dgap = 0.5 mm, resulting in a quench of the initial kernel (No Go)."
