    "question_text": "How does the steam-to-carbon ratio in steam methane reforming (SMR) influence coke formation and hydrogen yield, and what are the underlying thermodynamic and kinetic mechanisms?",
    "standard_answer": "The steam-to-carbon (S/C) ratio in SMR critically affects coke formation and hydrogen yield through thermodynamic equilibrium and kinetic pathways. Higher S/C ratios (typically 2.5–3.5) suppress coke formation by shifting the water-gas shift reaction equilibrium toward CO2 and H2 production, reducing carbon deposition via Boudouard reaction (2CO ⇌ C + CO2) and methane cracking (CH4 ⇌ C + 2H2). Thermodynamically, excess steam lowers carbon activity, preventing graphite formation. Kinetically, steam gasifies surface carbon intermediates (C* + H2O → CO + H2), maintaining catalyst activity. However, excessively high S/C ratios (>5) reduce process efficiency due to increased energy for steam generation and larger reactor volumes. The optimal S/C balance maximizes hydrogen yield while minimizing catalyst deactivation and energy penalties, governed by Le Chatelier's principle in reforming (CH4 + H2O ⇌ CO + 3H2) and shift (CO + H2O ⇌ CO2 + H2) reactions.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "Common ratios are between 2 [50] and 5 [43,44], whereas ratios between 2.5 [45] and 3.5 [50] are often considered to be an optimal value in terms of purified H2 yield, efficiency, and plant dimensions.",
      "2": "The performance of SMR is increased through applying high temperatures, and low pressures according to Le Chatelier´s principle, as well as addition of excess steam to avoid coke formation [44]."

    "question_text": "Explain the thermodynamic principles governing the voltage efficiency in polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis (PEMEL), including the roles of reversible cell voltage, overpotentials, and energy losses.",
    "standard_answer": "PEMEL voltage efficiency (ηV) is governed by thermodynamics and electrochemical kinetics. The reversible cell voltage (Uth = 1.23 V at 25°C) represents the minimum energy required for water splitting (H2O → H2 + ½O2), derived from Gibbs free energy change (ΔG = nFUth). Practical operation requires higher cell voltages (Ucell = 1.4–2.2 V) due to overpotentials: (1) Activation overpotential from slow electrode kinetics, described by Butler-Volmer equation, requiring extra voltage to drive electron transfer at anode (H2O → ½O2 + 2H+ + 2e−) and cathode (2H+ + 2e− → H2). (2) Ohmic losses from resistance in membrane, electrodes, and contacts, proportional to current density (IR drop). (3) Mass transport limitations from slow proton diffusion through membrane or product gas accumulation. Voltage efficiency is ηV = Uth/Ucell, typically 67–82% for PEMEL. Efficiency drops at high current densities due to increased ohmic and activation losses. Thermo-neutral voltage (1.48 V) accounts for full enthalpy supply electrically, but real systems operate above this due to irreversibilities, impacting overall system efficiency (ηLHV = LHV/Wel).",

      "1": "The theoretically required voltage (Uth) of a water electrolysis cell may be calculated based on the number of electrons that are exchanged per mole of decomposed water (n = 2) and the Faraday constant (F = 96,485C/mol), which quantifies the electrical charge per mole of electrons (eq. 7) [158,159].",
      "2": "The actual cell voltage (Ucell) is considerably higher in practice, due to an cell overpotential resulting from activation losses at the electrodes, mass transport limitations, as well as ohmic resistances [159]."

    "question_text": "How does the use of molten media in methane pyrolysis reactors enhance heat transfer and prevent carbon deposition, and what specific operational advantages does this provide according to the cited research?",
    "standard_answer": "Molten media reactors in methane pyrolysis utilize liquid metals like tin as both catalyst and heat transfer medium, enabling efficient thermal management. The high thermal conductivity of molten tin facilitates rapid heat distribution to methane bubbles as they rise through the column. This effective heat transfer between the molten medium and entrained CH₄ leads to constant recurrence of gas bubbles, which prevents the deposition of carbon on catalyst surfaces. The buoyancy-driven bubble dynamics cause carbon particles to separate from the molten medium and float to the surface, where they can be continuously removed. Liquid tin's suitability as a heat transfer medium allows for operation temperatures exceeding 1,200°C, enabling high conversion rates while maintaining stable temperature control. This continuous carbon separation mechanism prevents reactor clogging and eliminates the need for periodic shutdowns required in other reactor configurations where carbon accumulates on surfaces.",

Calculate the carbon by-product yield when meeting the current global pure hydrogen demand of 70 Mt/a via MP, and compare this to the forecasted global carbon black market of 15 Mt/a in 2025. Explain the engineering challenges this carbon oversupply creates for process economics and carbon management strategies.",
    "standard_answer": "The methane pyrolysis reaction CH4 → 2H2 + C has a stoichiometric mass balance of 16 g CH4 → 4 g H2 + 12 g C, giving a hydrogen-to-carbon mass ratio of 4:12 = 1:3. For the current global pure hydrogen demand of 70 Mt/a, the carbon by-product yield would be 70 Mt H2 × 3 = 210 Mt C. Comparing this to the forecasted global carbon black market of 15 Mt/a in 2025 reveals a massive oversupply factor of 210/15 = 14. This creates significant engineering challenges: First, the carbon management requires either permanent sequestration or development of new carbon utilization markets. Second, the economic viability of MP depends heavily on finding value for the carbon by-product, as only 25% of the product mass is the primary target product H2. Third, from a heat transfer perspective, the process must efficiently handle the solid carbon deposition that can cause reactor clogging and reduced heat transfer efficiency. Fourth, fluid mechanics considerations include managing the separation of solid carbon particles from the gas stream and preventing catalyst deactivation. The carbon oversupply necessitates either developing new industrial applications for carbon materials or implementing permanent carbon storage solutions to avoid environmental impacts from carbon release.",
    "original_text": {

In comparison, meeting the current annual demand of pure H2 of around 70 Mt [8] by MP would lead to approximately 210 Mt/a of carbon by-product and, thus, exceed the estimated market demand for carbon black by a factor of 14."
