    "question_text": "How do differential diffusion effects (e.g., non-unity Lewis numbers) influence flame propagation in stratified mixtures, and what are the implications for modeling turbulent stratified combustion?",
    "standard_answer": "Differential diffusion effects, arising from non-unity Lewis numbers (Le ≠ 1), significantly influence flame propagation in stratified mixtures by altering local flame structure, speed, and stability. Key mechanisms include: (1) Preferential diffusion of light species (e.g., H₂, H) compared to heat can lead to local enrichment or depletion of reactants in the flame zone. For example, in a lean stratified flame, if Le_fuel < 1, fuel diffuses faster than heat, causing local equivalence ratio increases that enhance flame speed and may prevent extinction. Conversely, if Le_oxidizer > 1, oxygen diffusion lags, potentially leading to local quenching. (2) These effects are amplified in mixture gradients, where differential diffusion can cause thermo-diffusive instabilities, manifesting as cellular flame structures or altered flame curvature. (3) In turbulent stratified flames, the interaction between differential diffusion and turbulence scales modifies flame wrinkling and burning rates. For instance, small-scale turbulence can amplify differential diffusion effects by enhancing scalar gradients. Modeling implications are profound: standard presumed PDF methods that assume equal diffusivities (Le=1) fail to capture these phenomena. Advanced approaches like flamelet-generated manifolds (FGM) or transported PDF methods must incorporate differential diffusion by solving additional transport equations for key species or using tabulated chemistry with Le corrections. This is crucial for predicting pollutant formation (e.g., NOx, soot) and flame stability in practical devices like DI SI engines or gas turbines, where mixture stratification is common.",

    "question_text": "In stratified turbulent combustion modeling, why is a two-scalar approach (e.g., mixture fraction and progress variable) necessary instead of a single-scalar model, and what specific physical phenomena does it capture that a single-scalar model misses?",
    "standard_answer": "A two-scalar approach is essential for stratified turbulent combustion because it separately tracks mixture composition (via mixture fraction Z) and reaction progress (via progress variable c), capturing phenomena that a single-scalar model cannot. Specifically: (1) It accounts for spatial and temporal variations in equivalence ratio, which directly affect laminar flame speed, flame temperature, and chemical kinetics. A single-scalar model assumes uniform mixture composition, missing these effects. (2) It resolves the coupling between mixing and reaction timescales; in stratified flames, the Damköhler number varies locally, influencing flame stabilization and extinction. (3) It enables modeling of partially premixed combustion regimes where both premixed and non-premixed modes coexist, as the mixture fraction identifies regions outside flammability limits. (4) The approach captures differential diffusion effects between species, which are significant in stratified flames due to varying Lewis numbers. For example, in lean-to-rich transitions, differential diffusion can alter local flame structure and burning rates. The two-scalar framework allows for more accurate closure models in RANS and LES by providing a joint PDF of Z and c, which is crucial for predicting mean reaction rates and pollutant formation in inhomogeneous mixtures.",

    "question_text": "How does the 'back-supported combustion' phenomenon in stratified flames enhance local burning rates compared to homogeneous premixed flames, and what are the key physical mechanisms driving this effect?",
    "standard_answer": "Back-supported combustion in stratified flames occurs when a flame propagates from a region of higher equivalence ratio into a leaner mixture, leading to enhanced local burning rates due to heat and radical diffusion from the richer combustion products. The key mechanisms include: (1) Preheating of the unburned lean mixture by thermal conduction from the hotter products of the richer combustion, which increases the local temperature and reduces ignition delay. (2) Diffusion of reactive radicals (e.g., H, O, OH) from the richer flame zone into the lean region, accelerating chain-branching reactions. (3) The local flame speed is modulated by the mixture gradient, with the flame experiencing a 'push' from the higher reactivity zone behind it. This results in a higher displacement speed than in a homogeneous lean flame. The effect is particularly pronounced when the mixture gradient is aligned with the flame normal, allowing efficient transport of enthalpy and species. In turbulent stratified flames, this can lead to significant local variations in heat release rate and flame structure, complicating modeling approaches that assume uniform mixture composition.",

    "question_text": "What role does flame surface density (Σ) play in characterizing turbulent stratified flames, and how do mixture inhomogeneities affect its transport and production mechanisms?",
    "standard_answer": "Flame surface density (Σ) quantifies the available flame area per unit volume in turbulent premixed combustion and is critical for modeling the turbulent burning rate. In stratified flames, mixture inhomogeneities significantly alter Σ transport and production through several mechanisms: (1) Local variations in laminar flame speed (SL) due to equivalence ratio gradients cause curvature and strain effects that modify flame surface generation. For instance, regions with higher SL tend to expand the flame surface, while lean areas may lead to local extinction, reducing Σ. (2) The scalar dissipation rate of mixture fraction (χZ) introduces additional production terms in the Σ transport equation, as mixing between rich and lean pockets can create new flame surfaces or cause merging. (3) Differential diffusion between heat and species in stratified mixtures can lead to thermo-diffusive instabilities, enhancing flame wrinkling and increasing Σ. (4) In RANS and LES models, the Σ equation includes source terms proportional to the mean strain rate and flame stretch, but these must be corrected for mixture fraction fluctuations. For example, the mean reaction rate is modeled as ρ̇c = ρuSLΣ, but SL becomes a function of Z, requiring a joint PDF of c and Z for accurate closure. Thus, mixture stratification complicates the Σ balance by introducing coupled effects of turbulence, chemistry, and transport.",

    "standard_answer": "In the presumed PDF approach for stratified combustion, the mean density ρ̄ is derived by integrating the inverse of the density function over the mixture fraction space, weighted by the Favre PDF P̃Z(Z). For a beta distribution, P̃Z(Z) = [Γ(a+b)/(Γ(a)Γ(b))] Z^(a-1) (1-Z)^(b-1), where parameters a and b are related to Z̃ and Z''² via a = Z̃[(1/Z̃) - 1] and b = (1-Z̃)[(1/Z̃) - 1], with the segregation factor gZ = Z''² / [Z̃(1-Z̃)]. The mean density is then ρ̄ = [∫₀¹ (1/ρ(Z)) P̃Z(Z) dZ]^(-1). Assuming adiabatic combustion and ideal gas law, ρ(Z) = ρ_u / (1 + τ c(Z)), where τ is the heat release parameter and c(Z) is the progress variable. For a given Z, ρ(Z) can be obtained from flamelet tables. The segregation factor gZ physically represents the intensity of mixture fraction fluctuations relative to the mean. When gZ → 0, the PDF is narrow, indicating nearly homogeneous mixture, and ρ̄ ≈ ρ(Z̃). When gZ → 1, the PDF is bimodal, with peaks at Z=0 and Z=1, meaning the mixture is highly segregated into pure fuel and air, leading to ρ̄ being dominated by the densities at these extremes. Thus, gZ captures the effect of mixture inhomogeneity on mean thermodynamic properties, which is crucial for accurate prediction of flow and combustion dynamics in stratified systems.",
