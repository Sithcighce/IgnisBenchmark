    "question_text": "Analyze the electrochemical oxidation mechanisms of sulfide at BES anodes, specifically addressing how electrode adsorption and intermediate formation determine whether elemental sulfur (S⁰) or sulfate (SO₄²⁻) becomes the dominant product. Include the role of microbial catalysis in altering product distribution and explain how the specific reaction sequences described in the paper lead to different sulfur species.",
    "standard_answer": "The electrochemical oxidation of sulfide at BES anodes follows specific reaction sequences that determine product selectivity between S⁰ and SO₄²⁻. Initially, sulfide adsorbs onto the electrode surface (Reaction 10a: HS⁻(aq) → HS⁻(ads)), followed by electrochemical oxidation to elemental sulfur (Reaction 11a: HS⁻(ads) → S⁰ + 2e⁻ + H⁺). The S⁰ can then be extracted by residual sulfide to form polysulfide (Reaction 13a: S⁰ + HS⁻(aq) → HS₂⁻(aq)). Polysulfide undergoes disproportionation to yield thiosulfate (Reaction 14a: 4HS₂⁻(aq) + 4OH⁻ → S₂O₃²⁻(aq) + 6HS⁻(aq) + 4H₂O) and tetrathionate (Reaction 15a: 2S₂O₃²⁻(aq) + HS₂⁻(aq) + H₂O → S₄O₆²⁻(aq) + 2HS⁻(aq) + OH⁻). Microbial catalysis significantly alters this distribution: 'The sulfide was reported to be first oxidized to S₂O₃²⁻ and then to S⁰ in the presence of the autotrophic denitrifier Pseudomonas sp. C27, and the SO₄²⁻ was produced when a mixed microbial community was developed at the anode.' Additionally, 'Reaction 10a represents the initial adsorption of sulfide on the electrode, and Reaction 11a is the electrochemical oxidation of sulfide to S⁰ and the extraction of S⁰ by residual sulfide as polysulfide are illustrated by Reactions 12a and 13a, respectively.' The dominance of S⁰ occurs primarily through electrochemical pathways at abiotic anodes, while microbial communities drive complete oxidation to SO₄²⁻ via enzymatic catalysis, with product distribution further influenced by coexisting pollutants that shape microbial ecology.",

    "question_text": "A microbial electrosynthesis system operates to produce acetate from CO₂ with a total charge transfer of 1.2 × 10⁶ C. If 0.65 mol of acetate is produced, calculate the cathodic Coulombic efficiency (CCE) given that acetate requires 8 mol electrons per mol. Based on the provided paper, explain the primary electron loss mechanisms in microbial electrosynthesis and how they affect the CCE value, including the typical percentage of electrons consumed by biomass formation and microbial metabolism, and identify other potential electron loss pathways that contribute to the remaining losses.",
    "standard_answer": "To calculate the cathodic Coulombic efficiency (CCE), we use the formula from the paper: CCE = [F × n × ΔN] / [∫Idt] × 100%, where F is Faraday's constant (96485 C/mol), n is the moles of electrons used per mole of electron acceptor (8 mol e⁻/mol acetate for acetate), ΔN is the moles of electron acceptor reacted (0.65 mol acetate), and ∫Idt is the total charge transferred (1.2 × 10⁶ C). Substituting the values: CCE = [96485 × 8 × 0.65] / 1,200,000 × 100% = [96485 × 5.2] / 1,200,000 × 100% = [501,722] / 1,200,000 × 100% = 0.4181 × 100% = 41.81%. This CCE of 41.81% indicates that only about 41.8% of the electrons from the cathode are utilized for acetate production. The primary electron loss mechanisms in microbial electrosynthesis, as per the paper, include biomass formation and microbial metabolism, which consume nearly 10% of the electrons transferred from the electrode. This is explicitly stated in the paper: 'Since biomass formation and microbial metabolism consume nearly 10% of the electrons transferred from the electrode, the CCE values in microbial electrosynthesis are generally lower than 90%.' However, in this case, the remaining electrons (approximately 58.2%) are lost to additional mechanisms beyond biomass and metabolism. Other potential electron loss pathways include hydrogen gas evolution at the cathode, competing metabolic reactions such as methanogenesis when mixed cultures are used, electron transfer inefficiencies due to poor electrode-microbe contact, and parasitic reactions with dissolved oxygen or other electron acceptors. These additional losses account for the significant gap between the typical 10% loss to biomass/metabolism and the calculated 58.2% total loss in this system.",

      "1": "The CCE is calculated by Eq. (5), as follows: CCE = [F n ΔN] / [∫Idt] * 100% where n denotes the moles of electrons used for the reduction of 1 mole of electron acceptor and ΔN denotes the moles of electron acceptor reacted.",
