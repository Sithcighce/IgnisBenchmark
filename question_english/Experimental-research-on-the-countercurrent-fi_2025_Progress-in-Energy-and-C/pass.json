    "question_text": "How does bed channelling affect the stability and efficiency of fixed-bed biomass combustion, and what operational or design strategies can mitigate its occurrence?",
    "standard_answer": "Bed channelling occurs when interconnected void spaces in the packed bed create preferential pathways for air flow, leading to non-uniform ignition front propagation. This phenomenon destabilizes combustion by causing chaotic burning patterns, significant temperature fluctuations, and localized peaks that can damage equipment. Channelling reduces combustion efficiency because air bypasses densely packed regions, leaving unburned fuel and increasing carbon-in-ash losses. It also exacerbates pollutant emissions by creating oxygen-rich and oxygen-deficient zones that promote CO and NOx formation. Mitigation strategies include optimizing particle size distribution to minimize void spaces, using graded bed packing to ensure uniform porosity, and employing grates that induce gentle bed movement to disrupt channel formation. Additionally, controlling air flux below critical levels where channelling initiates and implementing staged air injection can help distribute oxidant more evenly. In laboratory settings, uniform particle sizing and careful bed preparation are essential to avoid channelling and obtain reproducible results that accurately reflect industrial conditions.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "Channelling is caused by interconnected void spaces in the matrix formed by the packed bed, allowing air or gases to flow in preferential paths. These preferential routes cause the ignition front to propagate much faster along the inner surfaces of the passage than over other surfaces of the bed, causing chaotic burning patterns and significant fluctuations and peaks in temperature.",
      "2": "Fuel particles are ideally packed in a laboratory-scale fixed-bed reactor with a uniform size distribution. Otherwise, the odd high-porosity spots inside the bed may induce bed channelling."

    "question_text": "Explain the role of the Biot number in determining the thermal behavior of biomass particles during fixed-bed combustion, and how it influences the selection of modeling approaches for particle conversion.",
    "standard_answer": "The Biot number (Bi) characterizes the relative importance of internal versus external thermal resistance in solid fuel particles during combustion. When Bi < 0.1, internal temperature gradients are negligible, allowing the particle to be treated as thermally thin. This simplifies modeling by assuming uniform temperature throughout the particle, where heat transfer is dominated by external convection and radiation. The particle rapidly equilibrates with its surroundings, and conversion processes like drying, pyrolysis, and char oxidation occur simultaneously across the entire volume. Conversely, when Bi ≥ 0.1, significant internal temperature gradients exist, requiring the particle to be modeled as thermally thick. In this case, internal heat conduction must be accounted for, leading to sequential conversion fronts propagating from the surface inward. For biomass particles, which often have irregular shapes and varying sizes, the Biot number dictates whether detailed internal heat diffusion equations are necessary. High Bi values indicate that particle size, orientation, and thermal conductivity critically affect conversion rates, necessitating more complex numerical models that resolve intra-particle transport phenomena.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "The Biot number provides a criterion for any modelling involving transport by convection and diffusion. When Bi < 0.1, the internal temperature and concentration gradients may be neglected, simplifying the problem by a thermally thin particle approach. On the other hand, when Bi ≥ 0.1, the particles are considered thermally thick and inner heat diffusion must be considered.",
      "2": "The propagation speed of such a front depends on the particle size, its orientation in the airflow, and the external conditions, which are related to the Biot number (Bi)."

    "question_text": "How does the countercurrent configuration in fixed-bed biomass combustion affect the reaction zone thickness and ignition front propagation velocity compared to cocurrent systems, and what are the dominant heat transfer mechanisms in each case?",
    "standard_answer": "In countercurrent fixed-bed combustion, the ignition front propagates opposite to the airflow direction, resulting in a narrow reaction zone and slower propagation velocity. This occurs because fresh fuel is primarily heated by radiation from the hot char and combustion gases above, as convective heat transfer from the air is minimized due to opposing flow directions. The reaction zone thickness is reduced because heat conduction through the solid matrix becomes limited without significant convective augmentation. In contrast, cocurrent systems exhibit thicker reaction zones and faster propagation velocities because both radiation and convection contribute to preheating unreacted fuel ahead of the front. The air flow carries thermal energy directly into fresh fuel layers, enhancing heat transfer rates. The dominant mechanism in countercurrent systems is radiative heat transfer from the hot combustion products to the incoming fuel, while in cocurrent systems, convective heat transfer from the air stream supplements radiation, leading to more efficient energy transport and broader reaction zones.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "The reaction zone is very narrow in a countercurrent setup because the flame front and oxidant stream flow in opposite directions. Fresh fuel is heated mainly by radiation, as the air flow and the ignition wave advance in opposite directions, preventing other forms of heat transport from being effective.",

    "question_text": "Explain how air flux affects NOx formation and destruction in biomass fixed-bed combustion, specifically addressing the role of volatile material release and oxygen availability in the competing chemical pathways.",
    "standard_answer": "In biomass fixed-bed combustion, air flux significantly influences NOx formation and destruction through its impact on volatile material release and oxygen availability. As the paper states: 'Increasing the ignition rate with increasing air flux increases the amount of volatile material released in the reaction zone. Consequently, the level of NOx precursor gases emitted from biomass, such as NH3, HCN, and NO, increases.' This enhanced volatile release initially promotes NO destruction because bed combustion in the initial stages operates under rich conditions where combustible gases can use NO as an oxidant. However, further increases in air flux elevate oxygen concentrations, shifting the balance toward NO formation. The paper notes: 'When the O2 content decreases as the oxidation of volatiles consumes it, NO acts as an oxidant according to reactions to although the pathways can be much more complex than just this set of reactions.' This demonstrates the dual role of air flux - initially promoting NO reduction through increased volatile precursors that consume NO, but eventually enhancing NO formation through greater oxygen availability for oxidation reactions.",

    "question_text": "In a countercurrent fixed-bed biomass combustion experiment with multiple thermocouples placed along the bed height, the distance between adjacent thermocouples is 0.1 m and the raw bed bulk density is 400 kg/m³. The time differences for a reference temperature of 300°C to pass between consecutive thermocouple pairs are: 200 s between positions 1-2, 210 s between positions 2-3, and 190 s between positions 3-4. Calculate the ignition front velocity using the proper averaging method and determine the ignition rate. Explain the physical significance of these parameters and their relationship to the pyrolysis process in fixed-bed combustion.",
    "standard_answer": "To calculate the ignition front velocity, we must use the averaging method specified in the literature. First, we calculate the velocity between each thermocouple pair: v₁₂ = 0.1 m / 200 s = 0.0005 m/s, v₂₃ = 0.1 m / 210 s = 0.000476 m/s, v₃₄ = 0.1 m / 190 s = 0.000526 m/s. With NT = 4 thermocouples, the ignition front velocity is the average of these three values: v_ig = (0.0005 + 0.000476 + 0.000526) / 3 = 0.0005007 m/s ≈ 0.0005 m/s. The ignition rate is then calculated as m''_ig = ρ_b × v_ig = 400 kg/m³ × 0.0005 m/s = 0.2 kg/(s·m²). Physically, the ignition front velocity represents the propagation speed of the reaction zone through the bed, where fresh fuel particles undergo heating, drying, and pyrolysis. The ignition rate quantifies the mass of fuel entering the devolatilization phase per unit time and cross-sectional area. As the ignition front advances, it initiates pyrolysis in successive fuel layers, releasing volatile gases that mix with air and combust. The ignition rate is directly proportional to the pyrolysis rate since it determines how quickly fuel mass transitions into the volatile release phase. This relationship is crucial for designing air supply systems to match volatile production and ensure complete combustion while minimizing emissions.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "Finally, the ignition front velocity vig is obtained by the average of the ratios estimated in the previous step: vig = 1/(NT-1) * Σ [(H_{i+1} - H_i) / (t(T_ref)_{i+1} - t(T_ref)_i)]",
      "2": "The ignition rate m''_ig is directly related to the bed's release rate of volatile gases, also called the pyrolysis rate. The ignition rate is the result of the product of the ignition front propagation velocity (vig) and the raw bed bulk density (ρ_b): m''_ig = ρ_b vig"
