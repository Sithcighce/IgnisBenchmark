Bio-ethanol, as a clean and renewable fuel, is gaining increasing attention, mostly through its major
environmental benefits. It can be produced from different kinds of renewable feedstock such as e.g. sugar
cane, corn, wheat, cassava (first generation), cellulose biomass (second generation) and algal biomass
(third generation). The conversion pathways for the production of bio-ethanol from disaccharides, from
starches, and from lignocellulosic biomass are examined. The common processing routes are described,
with their mass and energy balances, and assessed by comparing field data and simulations. Improve-
ments through 5 possible interventions are discussed, being (i) an integrated energy-pinch of condensers
and reboilers in the bio-ethanol distillation train; (ii) the use of Very High Gravity (VHG) fermentation;
(iii) the current development of hybrid processes using pervaporation membranes; (iv) the substitution
of current ethanol dewatering processes to >99.5 wt% pure ethanol by membrane technology; and (v)
additional developments to improve the plant operation such as the use of microfiltration of the
fermenter broth to protect heat exchangers and distillation columns against fouling, or novel distillation
concepts.

Whereas the benefits of introducing these techniques are recognized, extensive research is still needed
to scientifically and economically justify their application. The paper finally presents a tentative eco-
nomic assessment, with production costs not only depending on the extent of applying process im-
provements, but also on the raw material used in the process.

1. Bio-ethanol: characteristics and worldwide potential

1.1. Ethanol and its characteristics

Ethanol or ethyl alcohol (CH3CH2OH) is a colorless, volatile and
flammable liquid, with molecular weight of 46.07 g and density of
789 kg/m3 at 294 K. Thermal properties are given in Table 1.

It burns with a smokeless blue flame, generally invisible in

normal light.

The auto-ignition temperature is the lowest temperature at
which ethanol will spontaneously ignite in a normal atmosphere
without an external source of ignition, such as a flame or spark.

Mixtures of water and ethanol are important throughout the
bio-ethanol process. The knowledge of mixture flash points, as
presented in Fig. 1, is needed for their safe handling, storage and
transportation: the flash point is one of the most important phys-
ical properties used to determine the potential for fire and explo-
sion hazards of liquids, used for the classification and labeling of
dangerous substances and preparations. The flash point of a given
liquid is the experimentally determined temperature adjusted to
standard temperature and pressure at which a substance emits
sufficient vapor to form a combustible mixture with air. A lower
flash point value indicates that a given liquid is more hazardous
relative to a different liquid with a higher value.

The physical properties of ethanol result from the presence of
both the hydroxyl group and the shortness of the carbon chain. The
hydroxyl group is prone to hydrogen bonding, making ethanol

more viscous and less polar than organic compounds of similar

(unlike > C3 alcohol) and with many organic solvents, e.g. acetic
acid, acetone, ether, ethylene glycol, glycerol, and toluene [1,2]. It is
also miscible with light aliphatic liquids, such as C5H12 and C6H14,
and with chlorinated aliphatics such as CH3CCl3 and Cl2CHeCHCl2
[2]. Mixing ethanol and water is slightly exothermic, releasing
~0.78 kJ/mol [3] at 298 K. Mixtures of ethanol and water at atmo-
spheric pressure form an azeotrope of ~89 mol% ethanol and
~11 mol% water [4] at a temperature of 351 K. This azeotropic
behavior is a pronounced function of temperature and pressure and
vanishes at temperatures below 303 K or pressures below about
10 mbar [5].

1þ2þ3: cellulosic materials; 2þ3: starch or carbohydrate rich materials).

The flash point of pure ethanol is 289.6 K only, lower than the
ambient temperature [6]. The flash points of ethanolewater solu-
tions are shown in Fig. 1 [7].

The general flow sheet of the fermentative bio-ethanol pro-
duction, including the starting fermentation and successive process
steps, is illustrated in Fig. 2.

Ethanol for industrial synthesis reactions or as a solvent is
mainly produced petrochemically through the acid-catalyzed hy-
dration of ethylene [8]:

C2H4 þ H2O/CH3CH2OH

The catalyst is most commonly phosphoric acid [9,10], absorbed
onto a porous carrier such as silica gel or diatomaceous earth.

Ethanol for use in alcoholic beverages, and the vast majority of
ethanol for use as bio-fuel [9,10], is produced by fermentation.
Certain species of yeast (e.g., Saccharomyces cerevisiae) or bacteria
(e.g. Zymomonas mobilis) metabolize sugars in oxygen-lean condi-
tions and produce ethanol and carbon dioxide. The chemical re-
actions for glucose/fructose and for sucrose as respective raw
materials are given below:

C6H12O6/2CH3CH2OH þ2CO2; for glucose and fructose
; for sucrose
C12H22O11 þ H2O/4CH3CH2OH þ 4CO2

The function of the different process steps, and the difference
between 1st, 2nd and 3rd generation raw materials will be dis-
cussed in Section 1.2. The possible introduction of membrane
separations is also indicated in the flow sheet, and will be detailed
in Section 5 of this paper.

The liquid waste of the fermenter (stream 8) and the stillage
recovered from the distillation (stream 5) of Fig. 2 are valuable
sources for anaerobic treatment. These streams contain moderate
concentrations of glucose and starch, respectively 1e20 g/L and up
to 200 g/L [11]. The waste water production exceeds 8 m3/ton bio-
ethanol, providing sufficient substrate for an efficient anaerobic
digestion. The biogas produced (~670 Nm3/ton bio-ethanol) has a
sufficient energy content to make a CHP (Combined Heat and Po-
wer) application viable, generating sufficient electricity to partly
power the whole bio-ethanol plant, whilst also providing hot water
(~353 K) to be used in the boiler.

The CO2 production of fermentation nearly equals the bio-
ethanol yield. The CO2 produced is recovered, cleaned, and

compressed/liquefied. A review paper [12] assessed the equipment
and operating costs needed to capture and liquefy CO2 for truck
delivery from an ethanol plant. Estimated costs are provided for
food/beverage grade CO2 and also for less purified CO2 suitable for
enhanced oil recovery or sequestration. The paper includes pre-
liminary plant and equipment designs and estimates major capital
and operating costs for each of the recovery options.

1.2. Worldwide production and research importance

1.2.1. The recognized potential of bio-ethanol

With the globalization of the increasing demand for energy,
energy shortage is a common worldwide problem. It is predicted
that the growth in the production of easily accessible oil and gas
will not match the projected rate of demand by 2040e2050, since
(cid:2)1 in 2008 to
the level of oil demand will increase from 85 Mb$day
(cid:2)1 in 2030 and to higher values thereafter [13], whilst
105 Mb$day
the number of vehicles will increase to 1.3 billion by 2030 and to 2
billion by 2050 [14]. In addition, concerns towards CO2 emissions

and associated climate change [15] have instigated an accelerated
research and production of renewable energy resources. Bio-
ethanol is considered as the alternative renewable fuel with the
largest potential to replace fossil-derived fuels, with a world pro-
duction of 50 million m3 in 2007 and in excess of 100 million m3 in
2012 [16], and with a potential for a significant reduction of
greenhouse gas emissions [17].

Brazil and the United States represent approximately 80% of the
world supply [16]. More than 20% of Brazilian cars are able to use
100% ethanol as fuel, including ethanol-only engines and flexefuel
engines. Flexefuel engines in Brazil are able to use pure ethanol, all
gasoline, or any mixtures of both. In the USA, flexefuel vehicles can
run on 0%e85% ethanol (15% gasoline) with higher ethanol blends
not yet allowed or deemed less efficient. Brazil produces ethanol
from domestically grown sugar cane. Sugar cane not only has a
higher concentration of sucrose than corn (by about 30%), but is
also much easier to be extracted. The bagasse generated by the
process is not wasted, but is used to produce process steam and
electricity. The US feed stock is mostly corn and wheat [16].

In developing economies, food-related feed stock is preferably
replaced by non-food raw materials, such as sweet sorghum or
cassava. Sweet sorghum can be used in ethanol fermentation, and is
suitable for growing in dry conditions: the water requirement of
sweet sorghum is one-third that of sugarcane on a comparable time
scale, and it requires about 22% less water than corn does. The
world's first sweet sorghum-based ethanol production distillery
began commercial ethanol production in 2007 in Andhra Pradesh,
India [14].

Sorghum is now also an important feedstock for bio-ethanol
production in the USA Plains states. In some parts of Europe,
particularly France and Italy, grapes have become a feedstock for
fuel ethanol from wine surplus. In Japan, it has been proposed to
use rice, normally converted into sake. Ethanol can be efficiently
produced from starches, with cassava starchy crop having the
highest ethanol yield. Thailand already had a large cassava industry
in the 1990s, for use as cattle feed and as a cheap admixture to
wheat flour. Nigeria and Ghana are establishing cassava-to-ethanol
plants. The world's first large-scale cassava ethanol plant was built
in Guangxi (China) by COFCO in 2007, with an annual production
capacity of 200,000 tons [18]. China operates several bio-ethanol
production plants for a total annual production capacity of
~2,085,000 ton/year, using mostly corn and wheat (~65%) and
cassava (~35%) as feedstock.

The main reasons for the enhanced development of bio-ethanol
are related to its specific and advantageous properties, as discussed
in detail in Section 2 of the paper. Its use as a favorable and near
carbon-neutral renewable fuel, thus reducing CO2 emissions and
associated climate change; its use as octane enhancer in unleaded
gasoline; and its use as oxygenated fuel-mix for a cleaner com-
bustion of petrol, hence reducing tailpipe pollutant emissions and
improving the ambient air quality, are the major driving forces
behind the development. The importance and potential of bio-
ethanol are highlighted in the literature, with recent exponential
research developments illustrated in Fig. 3.

1.2.2. The different “generations” of bio-ethanol production

Fermentation of sugar-based raw materials is referred to as “first
generation” bio-ethanol, whereas the use of lignocellulosic raw
materials is commonly called “second generation” bio-ethanol. The
“third generation” of algal bio-ethanol is at its early stages of
investigation. Recent references about first and second generation
bio-ethanol are summarized in Tables 2 and 3, respectively.

In view of the marked research development since about 2008
(in general) and since 2010 (specific novel technologies), we have
limited the literature survey to papers of the post-2010 period,
which mostly already assess previous work, whilst discussing state-
of-science development.

Fermentation of sugars is referred to as the first generation bio-
ethanol process, where yeast is cultured under favorable thermal
conditions to convert sugars into ethanol at around 308e313 K. The

Main results

- Increasing enzymatic hydrolysis after combined pretreatment is resulting from
or decrease in crystallinity of cellulose, loss of hemicelluloses, and removal or
modification of lignin.
- 87.2% lignin removal, and 80.0% saccharification;
- 17.7 g/L of ethanol with corresponding yields of 0.48 g/g (Saccharomyces
cerevisiae).
- High ethanol concentration of 3.7 vol% was obtained.

- Lowest environmental impact for second-generation bio-ethanol production;
- Highest exergy efficiency (Steam Explosion Pre-
treatment þ SSF þ Dehydration) reaching 79.58%.

toxicity of ethanol to yeast inhibits the conversion and limits the
ethanol concentration obtainable, as will be discussed in Section 3.
Although some expensive ethanol-tolerant strains of yeast are
known, they are not applied in producing fuel-grade ethanol due to
their cost, but are applied for wine and spirit production, e.g. Red Star
Pasteur Champagne and Lalvin EC-1118 wine yeasts, with inhibition
above 18 vol% ethanol only, or “Turbo Yeast” for concentrations of
20 vol% or higher. To produce ethanol from starchy materials such as
cereal grains, the starch must first be converted into sugars. In
brewing beer, this is generally accomplished by allowing the grain to
germinate, or malt, which produces the enzyme amylase. When the
malted grain is mashed, the amylase converts the starches into
sugars. For fuel ethanol, the hydrolysis of starch into glucose can be
accomplished more rapidly by treatment with dilute sulfuric acid
[39], fungally produced amylase, or a combination of both. In bio-
processes, amylase is the preferred additive [24,25].

As illustrated in Table 3, the second generation of bio-ethanol pro-
cesses uses cellulose-released sugars [68], although the cost of the
enzymes capable of hydrolyzing cellulose has been a limiting factor.
The Canadian company Iogen started the first cellulose-based
ethanol plant in 2004 [69]. Development of this technology could
deal with a number of cellulose-containing agricultural byproducts,
such as e.g. straw, wood trimmings, sawdust, bamboo and others.
Lignocellulosic materials typically contain lignin, cellulose and
hemi-cellulose. Hydrolysis of hemicellulose yields mostly five-
carbon sugars such as xylose. S. cerevisiae, the yeast commonly
used for ethanol production, cannot metabolize xylose. Other
yeasts and bacteria are under investigation to ferment xylose and
other pentoses into ethanol, and genetically engineered fungi that
produce large volumes of cellulase, xylanase, and hemicellulase
enzymes, are under investigation. These could convert agricultural
residues (e.g. corn stover, straw, sugar cane bagasse) and energy
crops (e.g. switchgrass) into fermentable sugars [67].

The third generation of bio-ethanol processes is at early stages of

investigation.

Recent references are summarized in Table 4.
Algae contain lipids, proteins, carbohydrates/polysaccharides and
have thin cellulosic walls. Whereas algal lipids are mostly extracted
and transformed into biodiesel, the left-over cake of starch (the
storage component) and cellulose (the thin wall component) can be
converted into bio-ethanol. Especially algae strains Glacilaria- and
Euglena gracilis appear promising candidates. The resulting com-
bined biodiesel/bio-ethanol process offers moreover an added
advantage of producing fermentation CO2 that can be captured and
used. Despite these advantages, the alternative production of
numerous valuable products from the algal cake (e.g. carrageenan,
agar) offers significant economic benefits in comparison with low-
priced bio-ethanol. Additional research is certainly required, and
the process cannot be considered for industrial application yet.

Whether first, second or third generation feed stock is used,
fermentation produces an alcohol-lean broth only, as such unusable

66

in most industrial and fuel applications. The ethanol must hence be
purified. Fractional distillation can concentrate ethanol to 95.6 vol%
(89.5 mol%), the azeotrope with a boiling point of 351.2 K. Further
ethanol enrichment by common distillation is impossible, but
different alternatives are possible, as discussed in detail in Section
5.5 of the present paper.

The most commonly applied methods to produce anhydrous,

fuel-grade ethanol, will be assessed in Section 5.4 of this paper.

2. The uses of bio-ethanol

2.1. Generalities

The largest single use of ethanol is as an engine fuel and fuel
additive. More than any other major country, Brazil relies on
ethanol as an engine fuel. Gasoline sold in Brazil contains at least
25% anhydrous ethanol. Hydrous ethanol (about 95% ethanol and
5% water) can be used as fuel in more than 90% of new cars sold in
the country. The US uses Gasohol (max 10% ethanol) and E85 (85%
ethanol) ethanol/gasoline mixtures. Ethanol may also be utilized as
a rocket fuel and in lightweight rocket-powered racing aircrafts
[85]. The Australian law limits the use of pure ethanol sourced from
sugarcane waste to 10% in automobiles. It has been recommended
that older cars (and vintage cars designed to use a slower burning
fuel), should have their valves upgraded or replaced [86].

The common types of available fuel-mixes are listed in Table 5.
The energy content and RON (Research Octane Number), of
ethanol, other fuels and mixes are also summarized in Table 5. The
octane rating of petrol is measured in a test engine and defined by
comparing the mixture of iso-octane and heptane that would have
the same anti-knocking capacity as the tested fuel itself. Fuel with
the same knocking characteristics as a mixture of 95% iso-octane
and 5% heptane would have an octane rating of 95. Of course, the
tested fuel does not contain just iso-octane and heptane in the
given proportions, but will have the same detonation resistance
characteristics. Since some fuels perform better than pure iso-
octane, octane numbers in excess of 100 are now accepted in a
modified definition. The most common rating is the RON (Research
Octane Number), determined in a test engine with a variable
compression ratio under controlled conditions (600 rpm). The
Motor Octane Number (MON) is also used, and often considered a
better measure of fuel behavior under load, as determined in a
900 rpm test engine. MON will normally be about 8e10 points
below RON. The low density of gasoline and ethanol are reflected in
the higher mass than volume heat content of the fuel.

Ethanol has appropriate properties for spark ignition IC engines.
Its MON and RON are respectively 90 and 109, on average 99
compared to 91 for regular gasoline. The lower heating value (LHV)
of ethanol is two-thirds that of gasoline. Bio-ethanol fuel is used in
IC engines as 5e26 percent anhydrous ethanol blends to gasoline

(5% maximum in Europe and in India, 10% in USA, 22e26%
mandatory blends in Brazil) or as pure fuel (100%) of dry ethanol in
dedicated vehicles, as illustrated in Table 6.

When anhydrous bio-ethanol is blended with gasoline in a small
proportion (up to 15%), the influence of its LHV has no significant
effect. For higher blend levels, more fuel is required compared to
when using conventional gasoline due to the lower LHV of ethanol.
Ethanol dedicated vehicles are adapted to improve the engine by
running at higher compression ratios to take advantage of the
better octane number of ethanol compared to gasoline: despite the
lower HV, such optimized vehicles running on pure ethanol still
have an operation range (cid:3)75% of the range of gasoline fueled cars
on a volume basis. Finally, special Flexible Fuel Vehicles (FFV) are
equipped with line sensors, which measure ethanol levels and
adapt the airefuel ratio to maintain good combustion conditions.
These vehicles can burn fuel containing ethanol (0e85%) in gaso-
line and are becoming more and more frequent, with various
manufactures developing such vehicles on a commercial scale with
special modification of carburetor, fuel injector, fuel pump, fuel
tank and catalytic converter when using E10 to E25 blends, whist
additional modifications of the engine itself, the intake manifold,
exhaust system and cold-start are incorporated for E25 to E100
(hydrous) blend. Apart from the advantages of using bio-ethanol in
IC engines, a few disadvantages should be considered: whereas low
levels of ethanol blended with gasoline increase the vapor pressure,
thus favoring evaporative emissions that contribute to smog for-
mation, higher ethanol blend levels have a low vapor pressure that
can lead to difficulties in cold weather conditions. Straight hydrous
ethanol as an automotive fuel has been widely used in Brazil for
neat ethanol vehicles and more recently for flexible-fuel vehicles:
the ethanol fuel is distilled close to the azeotrope mixture of
95.63 wt% ethanol and 4.73 wt% water. At the end of 2012, there
were ~20 million flexible-fuel vehicles running on Brazilian roads.
Hydrous ethanol imposes a limitation on normal vehicle operation,

Flexefuel

as the ethanol lower evaporative pressure (as compared to gaso-
line) causes problems when cold starting the engine at temperature
below 288 K. For this reason, both pure ethanol and flexefuel ve-
hicles are built with an additional small gasoline reservoir inside
the engine compartment to help in starting the engine when cold
by initially injecting gasoline. Once started, the engine is then
switched back to ethanol. An improved flexefuel engine generation
was developed to eliminate the need for a gasoline tank by
warming the ethanol during starting and allowing them to start at
temperatures as low as 268 K. The use of ethanol blends in con-
ventional gasoline vehicles is restricted to low mixtures, as ethanol
is corrosive and can degrade some of the materials in the engine
and fuel system. The hygroscopicity of ethanol should moreover be
considered in colder and humid climates, due to the possible
plugging of fuel lines by ice crystals, and due to the lower flash-
points at higher water contents.

Due to its low cetane number, ethanol does not burn efficiently
by compression ignition. Moreover, ethanol is not easily miscible
with diesel fuel. To improve the use of ethanol in CI vehicles,
measures can be taken, such as the addition of an emulsifier in
order to increase the ethanolediesel miscibility; or the addition of
ethylhexylnitrate or diterbutyl peroxide in order to enhance the
cetane number. Most blends of ethanol and diesel (E-diesel) are
limited to 15% ethanol and 5% emulsifiers [88].

Alternative solutions are either a dual fuel operation in which
ethanol and diesel are introduced separately into the cylinder, or
the modification of diesel engines in order to adapt their charac-
teristics of auto-ignition and make them capable to use high blends,
up to 95% ethanol [89].

2.2. The uses of bio-ethanol as fuel and feedstock in chemicals'
synthesis

The uses of bio-ethanol as a fuel or as raw material for the
chemical synthesis of other products have been dealt with in
numerous publications, some of the relevant and recent ones
(>2010) being summarized in Table 7.

When specifically discussed in the respective publications, the
environmental effects of using bio-ethanol as fuel are also included
in the summaries. From the literature survey, it appears that the
main reasons of the success of bio-ethanol are the following: (i) its
use as renewable energy to partially substitute oil and increase
security of supply; (ii) its use as octane enhancer in unleaded
gasoline to replace metyl-tert-butylether (MTBE); (iii) its use as
oxygenated compound for clean combustion of the gasoline, thus
reducing the tailpipe emissions and improving the ambient air
quality and (iv) its use as renewable fuel to reduce CO2 emissions
and its contribution to a reduced effect on climate change.

In addition to the few publications concerning the conversion of
bio-ethanol to H2, there is a recent revival of its conversion into
various organic chemicals with either a higher number of carbon-
atoms in their molecules, or/and with an added-value. Fig. 4 sum-
marizes the different options.

Although these conversion pathways offer possibilities to
upgrading bio-ethanol, their investigation is at an early stage of
research.

Specific recent literature about environmental effects has been

listed in Table 8.

The environmental advantages of using ethanol as a fuel are
recognized since it reduces harmful tailpipe emissions of carbon
monoxide, particulate matter, and nitrogen oxides. Argonne Na-
tional Laboratory analyzed the greenhouse gas emissions of
different engine and fuel combinations. Comparing ethanol blends
with gasoline alone, they showed reductions of 8% with the bio-
diesel/petrodiesel blend known as B20, 17% with the conventional

3. Bio-ethanol production

3.1. Major raw materials

Bio-ethanol can be produced from a large variety of carbohy-
drates (mono-, di-, polysaccharides). Monosaccharides (e.g. xylose,

Fig. 4. Conversion pathways of ethanol to different organic chemicals.

glucose, fructose) consist of single sugars, represented by (CH2O)n
with n 1⁄4 3e7. Pentoses (n 1⁄4 5, xylose) and hexoses (n 1⁄4 6, glucose)
are the most common monosaccharides in nature. Whereas glucose
is the most widespread sugar transport form in animal organisms,
sugar is often transported in the form of disaccharides in plants
(sucrose, maltose, and lactose). A disaccharide is formed by dehy-
dration coupling of two monosaccharides. Polysaccharides are
composed of similar subunits (monomers), with e.g. starch and
cellulose composed of monomers of glucose. Polysaccharides must
be hydrolyzed into disaccharides and/or monosaccharides before
ethanol fermentation.

Large-scale carbohydrate-to-ethanol plants mostly use sugar-
cane or sugar beet juice, corn or wheat. Ethanol is also commer-
cially produced in the pulp and paper industry as a by-product.
These carbohydrates-to-ethanol crops include both multipurpose

crops, also devoted to food markets; and dedicated ethanol crops.
Whereas the latter are cultivated especially for ethanol production
on non-agricultural lands, the former provide almost all of the
feedstock now used to date for ethanol production (sugarcane in
Brazil and corn in the United States), where the development of
biomass-to-ethanol conversion emerged as alternative markets for
sugar, corn or wheat surpluses.
In developing countries, the
possible competition with food is shifting from using agricultural
crops towards non-food feedstock, e.g. cassava, sweet sorghum.

Lignocellulosic biomass can be considered as feedstock for bio-
ethanol production in the medium and long term due to its low cost
and high availability. Criteria and methodologies for assessing the
sustainability of energy crops have been developed [122,123]. As
illustrated in the literature survey of Table 3, the ethanol yields
when using lignocellulose biomass are only reported for lab-scale

investigations. As of 2013, the first conmercial-scale plants have
started operation. Multiple pathways for the conversion of different
feedstocks are being used. In the next few years, associated cost
data and their relative performance will become available. A pre-
liminary assessment of the lignocellulosic bio-ethanol is given by
Limayem and Ricke [124].

Carbohydrate-to-ethanol processes have been used for several
decades, and conversion data are established. Per ton of bio-
ethanol, the required amount of raw materials required ranges
from 5 to 6.6 ton for cassava, 3e3.2 ton for corn, and 12e13.5 ton
of sugarcane [125,126]. Similar feed stock requirements when
using lignocellulosics are not yet available. The ethanol production
cost is moreover scale sensitive, with also costs of feedstock
collection and transport to be considered. Optimal sizes currently
vary between 50 and 500 thousand ton per year, defining the
amount of feedstock required for given or known conversion
yields of the feedstock.

3.2. Main steps in biomass-to-ethanol processes

Once the feed stock is delivered to the ethanol plant, it needs to
be carefully stored and conditioned to prevent early fermentation
and bacterial contamination. Through pre-treatment, simple sugars
are made available in proportions depending on the type of
biomass used and the pre-treatment process. The main steps,
different according to the feedstock, are summarized in Fig. 5,
providing a general production flowsheet for the different bio-
ethanol generations.

The processes are equivalent from the fermenter onwards, and
then start with a dilute ethanol-in-water fermenter broth. The
hydrolysate, the yeasts, nutrients and other ingredients are added
from the beginning of the batch fermentation. Continuous pro-
cesses, in which ingredients are constantly added and products
removed from the fermentation, are also used [127]. The cell den-
sities are kept high by recycling or immobilizing the yeasts to

improve their activity and enhance the fermentation yield. The
fermentation reactions occur at 298e314 K and last 1 to ~3 days
depending on both the feedstock composition, and the type,
amount and activity of the yeasts. Distillation will separate ethanol
and water up to the azeotropic point. The residual flow from the
distillation column, known as vinasse or stillage, can either be used
to produce biogas by anaerobic digestion (to produce process steam
and electricity), or processed into animal food, fertiliser and other
valuable by-products.

3.3. Bioethanol from disaccharides- and starch

The most common disaccharide used for bio-ethanol production
is sucrose, i.e. the combined molecule of glucose and fructose. Its
fermentation is performed using commercial yeast such as S. cer-
evisiae in a successive hydrolysis of sucrose followed by fermen-
tation of simple sugars: invertase (an enzyme present in the yeast)
catalyzes the hydrolysis of sucrose into glucose and fructose, and
another enzyme (zymase), also present in the yeast, subsequently
converts the glucose and the fructose into ethanol and CO2.

The practical efficiency of fermentation is about 90e92%. Su-
crose is mostly available in sugarcane and sugar beet, where the
production of sugar is the main objective, and bio-ethanol is pro-
duced from the molasses, the residue after sugar crystallization.

Starch consists of long chains of a-glucose monomers, 1000 for
one amylose molecule and 1000e6000 or more for amylopectin
[128]. To convert starch to ethanol, the polymer of a-glucose needs
to be hydrolyzed into glucose by the gluco-amylase enzyme.

(3.1)

The resulting sugar is known as dextrose or D-glucose, an isomer
of glucose. The enzymatic hydrolysis is then followed by fermen-
tation and successive ethanol separation technique. Corn and cas-
sava contain 60e70% starch. The milled raw material is hydrolyzed
and the resulting sugar contained in the hydrolysate is converted to
ethanol while the remaining residue containing fibre, oil and pro-
tein is roasted and converted into a by-product known as Distillers
Dried Grains (DDG) or DDGS when it is combined to process syrup
and sold mainly as animal feed additive (as molasses are also
commonly used for). The CO2 produced can be sold for different
applications (carbonated beverages or dry ice).

3.4. Lignocellulosic biomass-to-ethanol

Lignocellulose [128], the principal component of the plant cell
walls, is mainly composed of cellulose (40e60% of the total dry
weight), hemicellulose (20e40%) and ligin (10e25%). Cellulose
molecules consist in long chains of b-glucose monomers gathered
into micro-fibril bundles. The hemicelluloses, mostly xyloglucans
or xylans, are linked to the micro-fibrils by hydrogen bonds. Lignins
are phenolic compounds which are formed by polymerization
different productions of three types of monomers (p-coumatyl,
coniferyl and synapyl alcohols). Lignin adds compressive strength
and stiffness to the cell wall [129]. Lignocellulose is abundant in
nature does not compete with food, is available as agricultural and
forestry residues, industrial wastes and dedicated woody crops
(willow, poplar). Once the lignocellulosic biomass is pre-treated
and hydrolysed, the released sugars are fermented and the down-
stream process is similar to that of first generation feed stock.
Pretreatment involves delignification of the feedstock [130] in or-
der to make cellulose more accessible in the hydrolysis step, using
physical, physico-chemical, chemical and biological treatment
(Table 9).

Carbonic acid and alkaline extraction have the best perfor-
mance. However, the most common methods are steam explosion
and dilute acid pre-hydrolysis, which are followed by enzymatic
hydrolysis. Sulphuric acid or carbon dioxide are often added in
order to reduce the production of inhibitors and improve the sol-
ubilization of hemicellulose [131]. Steam explosion has a few lim-
itations since the ligninecarbohydrate matrix is not completely
broken down; degradation products are generated that reduce the
efficiency of hydrolysis and fermentation steps; and a portion of the
xylan fraction is destroyed.

The use of dilute sulphuric acid (0.5e1%; 433e463 K for 10 min)
has the preference of the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory
[134,135]: hemicellulose is largely hydrolysed releasing different
simple sugars (xylose, arabinose, mannose and galactose) but also
other compounds of the cellulosic matrix, that can however inhibit
the enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation. Part of the acetic acid,
much of the sulphuric acid and other inhibitors produced during
the degradation of
the materials need to be removed, and
neutralization is performed before fermentation.

Enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose is achieved using cellulases,
usually a mixture of groups of enzymes such as endoglucanases,
exoglucanases and b-glucosidases acting in synergy for attacking
the crystalline structure of the cellulose, removing cellobiose from
the free chain-ends and hydrolysing cellobiose to produce glucose.
Cellulases are produced by fungi, mainly Trichoderma reesei, besides
Aspergillus, Schisophyllum and Penicillium. High concentrations of
cellobiose and glucose inhibit the activity of cellulase enzymes and
reduce the efficiency of the saccharification. One of the methods
used to decrease this inhibition is to ferment the reduced sugars
along their release. This is achieved by simultaneous saccharifica-
tion and fermentation (SSF), in which fermentation using yeasts (S.
cerevisiae) and enzymatic hydrolysis are achieved simultaneously
in the same reactor. The fermentation of the xylose released from
the pre-hydrolysis process can be carried out in a separate vessel or
in the SSF reactor using a genetically modified strain from the
bacterium Z. mobilis that can convert both glucose and xylose. The
latter method is named simultaneous saccharification and co-
fermentation (SSCF).

Compared to the sequential saccharification and fermentation
process, SSCF exhibits several advantages like lower requirement of
enzyme, shorter process time and cost reduction due to economy in
fermentation reactors (only one reactor compared to the multiple
sets). Disadvantages include the difference between optimal tem-
peratures for saccharification (323e333 K) and fermentation
(303 K), inhibition of enzymes and yeast by ethanol and the
insufficient robustness of the yeast in co-fermenting C5 and C6
sugars. The effluent from the distillation column that contains most
of the lignin and other non-fermentable products is sent to a

combined heat and power (CHP) plant to produce process steam
and electricity required by the ethanol plant. Depending on the
proportion of lignin in the feedstock, excess electricity may be
available for export sale.

Contrary to the conversion of disaccharides and starch to
ethanol which are mature technologies, the modern lignocellulose-
to-ethanol process is still at a pilot and demonstration stage,
although demonstration plants of NREL (USA) [135], Iogen Corpo-
ration (Canada) [69], and ETEK (Sweden) [136], have built pilot
plants capable of producing a few hundred thousand liters of
ethanol per year.

3.5. Fermentation of hexoses and pentoses

From the prevous review of first and second generation bio-
ethanol processes, it is clear that a variety of microorganisms
such as yeasts, bacteria or fungi are required to biochemically
convert hexoses (C6, first generation, second generation) and
pentoses (second generation). The conversion reactions are
different:

C6H12O6/2C2H5OH þ 2CO2

3C6H10O5/5C2H5OH þ 5CO2

(3.2)

(3.3)

S. cerevisiae, a facultative anaerobic yeast, and Z. mobilis, a gram-
negative bacterium are commonly used to convert C6 sugars. Both
are adapted to ethanol fermentation, with a high ethanol tolerance,
and amenability to genetic modifications. Both are however unable
to ferment C5 sugars. Other yeasts and bacteria are under investi-
gation to ferment xylose and other pentoses into ethanol, with
Candida shehatae and Pichia stiplis yeasts offering a good potential,
despite a low tolerance to ethanol, a low ethanol yield and inac-
tivity at low pH. Pachysolen tannophilus and Escherichia coli, both
gram-negative bacteria, are able to use both pentose and hexose
sugars. Kluveromyces marxianus, a thermophilic yeast, is able to
grow at a temperature above 325 K; and is capable to ferment a
broad spectrum of sugars. Excess of sugars affect its alcohol yield. It
has however a low ethanol tolerance and poor xylose fermentation
thermoanaerobacterium sac-
yield. Thermophilic bateria, e.g.
chaarolyticum, thermoanaerobacter ethanolicus, clostridium ther-
mocellum, are extreme anaerobic bacteria,
to an
extremely high temperature of 343 K. These bacteria can ferment a
variety of sugars, display cellulolytic activity, but exhibit a low
tolerance to ethanol.

resistant

Genetically engineered microorganisms [69,137e139] that pro-
duce large volumes of cellulase, xylanase, and hemicellulase en-
zymes, are under investigation. These could convert agricultural
residues (e.g. corn stover, straw, sugar cane bagasse) and energy
crops (e.g. switchgrass) into fermentable sugars [69]. The devel-
opment of genetically modified fermentative and cellulolytic mi-
croorganisms is recommended to increase the ethanol yield and
productivity under the stress conditions of high production bio-
ethanol processes [140].

Genetic engineering has succeeded in altering the conventional
S. cerevisiae's capacity to ferment glucose and pentose sugars
simultaneously [141]. Almaida et al. [142] investigated a modified
S. cerevisiae, capable of co-fermenting saccharides but also gener-
inhibitors. Z. mobilis remains an attractive
ating less furfural
candidate due to its high ethanol yield and resistance to tempera-
ture in the range of 313 K [137]. Numerous genes have been
introduced and heterologous expression has been incorporated
into Z. mobilis to extend its effectiveness toward other substrates
namely, xylose and arabinose [143]. Both the gene engineered

investigations in the bio-ethanol fermentation is presented in
Table 10.

Enhancing ethanol production by pre-treatment involving fungi
(e.g. T. reesei and Basidiomycetes) with appropriate lignocellulolytic
properties at low pH and high temperatures is also a promising and
added-value step in ethanol bioconversion. While fungi act slowly,
potential lignocellulolytic fungi have been produced by mutagen-
esis, gene expression and co-culturing [139]. Some genera, such as
Candida, Pichia and Dekkera were isolated from sugarcane molasses,
but resulted in low ethanol concentrations and produced acetic
acid, an inhibitor of the fermentative yeast. Some natural wild yeast
species appear capable of replacing S. cerevisiae in second-
generation bioethanol, but their low bio-ethanol yield and poor
survival in the fermenter need further improvement.

3.6. The problem of ethanol-inhibition in the first generation
feedstock fermentation

The yield of the fermentation fixes the total energy needed
during the downstream separation processes, mostly by distilla-
tion. This yield is not only limited by the conversion rate, but also by
process inhibition, Inhibition occurs when the concentration of a
chemical, either produced during the reaction or present in the
reaction mix, reaches a toxic value, whereby the reaction rate is
hampered or possibly even stopped by deactivation of enzymes or
by the death of the microorganism. This phenomena is responsible
for the low achievable ethanol concentrations in industrial fer-
menters. The maximum concentration of ethanol attained in most
fermenters is around 11e12 wt%. Due to the fact that ethanol-
inhibition is a very complex and difficult phenomena, a lot of
unknows about the problem and its solution exist. Ethanol inhibits
the system in 3 ways, i.e. inhibition of the cell growth, inhibition of
the fermentation and cell death. The first two effects are illustrated
below (Fig. 6), for fermentation of lactose by Candida pseudo-
tropicalis (150 g/L) [145,146].

This inhibition is a consequence of the effect of ethanol on the
plasma membrane and the enzymes in the first glycolysis step of
fermentation [146]. These enzymes, particularly hexokinase, are
very sensitive to high ethanol concentrations: their activity de-
creases and the fermentation rate drops. Furthermore the high
ethanol concentration hampers the plasma membrane fluidity,
necessary for the transport of nutrients in and out of the microor-
inhibition
leading to reduced activity. A review of
ganism,

To increase the critical inhibition concentration, adapted yeasts
can be used. The most commonly used yeast is S. cerevisiae, with a
moderate yield of fermentation. Research has been done on more
promising yeasts and bacteria: Z. mobilis succeeds to survive higher
ethanol concentrations in the fermenter. Not only this advantage,
but also a high tolerance for acids and sugars, makes this a very
popular yeast for industrial application. The fermentation rate is also
higher with Z. mobilis in comparison to Saccharomyces cerevisiae
[146] The research on this baterium has lead to the development of
very high gravity (VHG) fermentation, as described in Section 5.2. Z.
mobilis is a bacterium belonging to the genus Zymomonas. Originally
isolated from alcoholic beverages like African palm wine or Mexican
pulque, it is also a contaminant of cider and beer in European
countries. The advantages of Z. mobilis over S. cerevisiae with respect
to producing bio-ethanol: (1) higher sugar uptake and ethanol yield
[152]; (2) lower biomass production; (3) higher ethanol tolerance,
up to 16 vol% [165]; (4) amenability to genetic manipulations. An
interesting characteristic of Z. mobilis is indeed that its plasma
membrane contains hopanoids, pentacyclic compounds similar to
eukaryotic sterols, thus providing an extraordinary tolerance to
ethanol in its environment, around 16 wt%.

However, in spite of these attractive advantages, its substrate
range is limited to glucose, fructose and sucrose. It cannot ferment
C5 sugars like xylose and arabinose which are important compo-
nents of lignocellulosic hydrolysates. Unlike yeast, Z. mobilis cannot
tolerate toxic inhibitors present in lignocellulosic hydrolysates such
as acetic acid and various phenolic compounds [159]. Concentra-
tion of acetic acid in lignocellulosic hydrolysates can be as high as
1.5 wt%, well above the tolerance threshold of Z. mobilis.

Several attempts have been made to engineer Z. mobilis to
overcome its inherent deficiencies by metabolic engineering,
mutagenesis or adaptive mutation to produce acetic acid resistant
strains of Z. mobilis [143,160,161]. However, when these engineered
strains metabolize mixed sugars in the presence of inhibitors, the
yield and productivity are much lower, thus preventing their in-
dustrial application.

As mentioned before, albeit outside the scope of our first gen-
eration feedstock approach, other types of inhibition occur during
the processing of lignocellulosics. They include sugar degradation
products, lignin degradation products, compounds derived from
extractives and heavy metal ions. Sugar degradation products are

4. Traditional processing routes

Integrated saccharification/fermentation processes versus two-

4.1.
step processes

Fig. 5 of Section 3.2 illustrated the successive steps of the overall
process,
including the different enzymatic activities during
saccharification and fermentation. Whereas some processes, e.g.
Lurgi [162] separate both steps, other processes, e.g. Cofco [24]
combine the dual enzymatic activity within the fermenter solely.
Despite this difference, fermentation yields obtained are nearly
equal, and hence not affecting the subsequent bio-ethanol purifi-
cation train and/or waste treatment. The fermentation yield de-
pends upon the conversion of starch or monosaccharides content in
the first place (mostly 60e70%, as function of the first generation

fermentation itself,
raw material), coupled with the yield of
generally >90%. The mass balance of the processes can hence be
established, and is illustrated in Fig. 7 for the cassava-based bio-
ethanol production of the Cofco concept [24].

The combined Cofco process uses 6 fermenters in parallel, each
fermenter having a volume of 3025 m3, i.e. ~3025 ton. 865 ton of
cassava flour is used per batch of 65 h. The production is based
upon a 70% starch-content of cassava and 90% starch-to-glucose
conversion. The amount of starch converted is hence 549 ton.
Fermenter broths of all 6 fermenters are collected and dealt with in
a single continuous distillation train.

The recycle to the fermenter is applied to keep the enzyme and

yeast balance at the required level.

For the total Cofco process, using 6 parallel fermerters, the total
production capacity is ~200,000 tpa of anhydrous ethanol. Since
industrial capacities
this capacity is the average of current
(50,000e400,000 tpa), we have selected 200,000 tpa as target
capacity.

Several distillation flowsheets have been presented in literature,
with minor process-specific defferences (2 or 3 distillation col-
umns), but with an overall equivalent mode of operation to enrich

the ethanol-lean broth to the ethanolewater azeotrope. Since field
data for the Cofco application are available and published, Cofco is
more readily assessed than other applications where field data are
not available.

The flow sheet of the current distillation process of the Cofco
cassava-based fuel ethanol production (200,000 tpa) is shown in
Fig. 8.

It consists of a sequence of distillation columns, heat ex-
changers, pumps and a flash tank. The feed stream enters the crude
column C1501. The distillate from C1501 is fed to column C1502.

The side stream 4 is fed to the stripping section C1503-1 of the
second column. C1503-2 is the rectifying section of the second
column. C1503-1 has no condenser and C1503-2 has no reboiler.
The bottom stream 10 enters C1502. Stream 15 is the ethanol-rich
phase. Simultaneously, the distillate from C1502 is separated via
the flash tank V1504, whose gas and liquid streams are both fed to
C1503. The bottom streams (5, 9, 16) are directed to the wastewater
treatment unit and should therefore be ethanol-lean ((cid:5)0.05 wt%
ethanol). Finally the distillate from C1503-2 is further dewatered
using molecular sieve adsorption to an anhydrous finished product

of 99.7 wt% ethanol [163]. A reboiler saturated steam circuit at
443 K (8 bar) is available. Fig. 8 does not include condenser/reboiler
heat recovery, as well be dealt with in Section 5.1.

The distillation train of the Lurgi concept [162] is represented in
Fig. 9, and uses 2 distillation columns, 2 heat exchangers and
associated pumping. Distillation columns C1501 and C1502 use
steam of 373 K and 413 K, respectively.

The analogy between the illustrated Cofco and Lurgi designs is
outspoken, since the first Cofco column (C1501) does not considerably
enrich the top and side streams, but mostly eliminates the fine sus-
pended solids of the broth, further evacuated in the bottom stream.

4.2.1. Fermentation broth

As example of the complete analysis, the large-scale cassava-
based operation of Cofco [24,25] is examined as distillation feed.
The composition of the cassava fermentation broth is shown in
Table 11.

The feed flow rate is about 220,000 kg/h at atmospheric pres-
sure, and 305 K. Since high boiling point components were not
individually analyzed, they are grouped as C20H16 for use in the
subsequent simulations.

Referring to Fig. 8 before and the different key-parts of the
distillation process, the number of the theoretical trays and oper-
ating pressure of each column are taken from the field data, and
shown in Table 12.

The operating pressure increases along the distillation train, from
about 0.5 to about 6 bar. Number of trays and reflux ratio are common
and important operation characteristics of the respective columns.

4.2.2. Simulation in Aspen Plus of the basic concept (no internal
energy recycle)

Aspen Plus V8.2 is a comprehensive chemical process modeling
system, used by the world's leading chemical and specialty chem-
ical organizations, and related industries to design and improve
their process plants. To simulate the process operation, the soft-
ware Aspen Plus V8.2 was used [164]. Due to the presence of the
highly polar components, ethanol and glycerol, both the non-
random two liquid (NRTL) and universal quasi-chemical (UNI-
QUAC) thermodynamic/activity models were used to predict the
activity coefficients of the components in a liquid phase [165].
Some unavailable interaction parameter coefficients were esti-
mated using the UNIQUAC liquideliquid equilibrium module. Re-
sults from the simulation towards operating temperatures in the
different columns were compared with the real values of Table 12.
The comparison of Table 13 shows an excellent agreement, with
simulated column temperatures and ethanol concentration of
simulation and plant measurements in fair agreement.

For a stream feed at 443 K and the different reboiler tempera-
tures, a conservative average sensible and latent enthalpy of steam
is taken at 2300 kJ/kg steam. For a total production of 25375 kg/h of
pure ethanol, the steam requirements are:

38; 826 (cid:6) 3600
25; 375 (cid:6) 2200

1⁄4 2:50 kg steam=kg bio (cid:2) ethanol

(4.2)

A stream duty of about 0.5 kg steam/kg bio-ethanol must be

added for the molecular sieve separation (see Section 5.5).

This high steam requirement of the fundamental solution,
without in-process heat recovery should be reduced to as low value
as possible in order to improve the operation economy of the bio-
ethanol production. This will be dealt with in Sections 5 and 6
hereafter.

5. Process improvements

5.1. Energy integration within the current production processes

As can be seen from Table 12, the pressure is progressively
increased along the distillation train. It is hence possible to recover
condenser heat to feed the reboilers of previous columns. The heat
duty difference between the top of C1502 and the bottom of its
neighbor C1503 is sufficient to modify the system into a combined
reboiler/condenser distillation: the top high pressure condensate of
condenser C1502 is used as the heat source for the reboiler of
C1503, and top high pressure condensate of C1503 is used as the
heat source for the reboiler of C1501. In this energy recycling
scheme and accounting for a required thermal driving force in the
reboilers of about 288e293 K, the remaining steam consumption
will only be due to the bottom reboiler of C1502.

Referring to Table 13, the total reboiler heat duty of the heat-

integrated distillation train will be

QREBðkWÞ 1⁄4 18; 222 kW

(5.1)

At the average steam enthalpy of 2300 kJ/kg, the energy con-

sumption of the integrated reboiler-condenser solution is

18; 222 (cid:6) 3600
25; 375 (cid:6) 2200

1⁄4 1:18 kg steam=kg bio (cid:2) ethanol

(5.2)

In the current Cofco operation, this reboiler-condenser inte-
gration is largely applied, with steam duties cited as ~1.3 kg steam/
kg bio-ethanol, in fair agreement with the Aspen-simulated results.

5.2. The use of VHG fermentation: principles and application results

Introduction of very high gravity (VHG) fermentation

In traditional starch fermentation, Saccharomyces cerevisiae is
used as yeast, however with the drawback of inhibition at ethanol
concentrations in excess of ~12 vol%. The use of specific yeasts or

bacteria, such as Z. mobilis, with higher inhibition levels, opened the
way to very high concentration fermentation, referred to as very
high gravity (VHG) fermentation, and capable of increasing the
total fermentation yield. In VHG, very high concentrations of sugars
(>250 g/L) are loaded into the fermenter when compared to clas-
sical fermentation. VHG is commonly referred to as the digestion of
a feed which contains more than 27 wt% of dissolved solids. Some
recent literature is reviewed in Table 14.

Much higher concentrations of ethanol can be maintained in the
fermenter by application of this technique, and ethanol concen-
trations of 23.8 vol% have been reached [174]. Besides this advan-
tage, a lower risk of contamination and a saving of fermenter
volume space can be realised by using VHG fermentation [168], as
further illustrated in Section 5.4.

The principles of inhibition have been dealt with in Section 3.6,
with the high osmotic pressure and toxic effects of ethanol as main
causes. A lot of research has been done the past few years to un-
derstand these extreme conditions and to anticipate on them.
Research has been focusing on the micro-organisms themselves,
added nutrients and osmoprotectants. As a result, it became clear
that the fermentation rate can be raised [175] by addition of
ergosterol, oleic acid or polysaccharides, whilst, higher ethanol
concentrations can also be achieved when ureum, yeast-extracts or
ammonia salts are added [176]. The major drawback of applying
VHG fermentation is the high viscosity in the fermenter as a result
of the high sugar concentrations. This high viscosity hinders the
solid/liquid separation and the heat exchange during the distilla-
tion. To solve this problem Wang et al. suggest using pectine-

degrading enzymes or other enzymes like xylase, cellulase and
xylanase to lower the viscosity [177]. In the case of applying VHG
fermentation, the use of partial pervaporation (see 5.3) might be
very interesting: reducing the ethanol concentration in the VHG
fermerter will reduce the inhibition stress on the bacteria.

5.2.2. Effect of implementing VHG on the distillation thermal
requirements

The previous simulation (Table 13) accounted for 11.6 wt%
ethanol. If the ethanol content of the broth can be increased, the
required heat duty of the distillation can be reduced due to the
reduction of H2O content of the broth.

Although VHG results up to 23.8 vol% have been reported [174],
the authors conservatively examined situations between 15 and
19 vol%, at a constant production of 25,375 kg/h of ethanol.

Results are presented in Table 15, for the 15 and 19 vol% cases

only.

As expected, the lowest reboiler duty is obtained at VHG of
19 vol%. If again the condenser heat of C1502 recycled to the
reboilers of the lower-pressure column, the required heat duty is
reduced to:

given experimental results, and extrapolated to the large scale
operation of 220,000 kg/h, the following steady-state mass balance
of Fig. 10 prevails:

FCOLUMN 1⁄4 0:7FFEED þ FRETENTATE 1⁄4 165; 000 kg=h;

5.3.1.

Introduction of hybrid operations

The use of water-ethanol separation membrane technology has
attracted an increasing attention in research, with some relevant
literature (>2010) summarized in Table 16.

Clearly, the hybrid operation mode is recognized as an impor-
tant development, with high permeate fluxes obtained, providing
additional energy savings, and overall cost reduction.

5.3.2. Effect of implementing pervaporation on the distillation
thermal requirements

The above literature survey already indicated that a hybrid
fermentation-distillation mode by integrating pervaporation, could
reduce the risk of fermenter ethanol inhibition by continuously
removing ethanol from the fermenter broth, whilst also reducing
the heat duty of the distillation through feeding the distillation
with ethanoleH2O streams at higher ethanol concentration.

Although literature provides indications concerning obtainable
membrane fluxes, and ethanol selectivity, a confirmatory set of
experiments was carried out by the authors using a pervaporation
(hydrophobic) membrane of Pervatech PDMS. Experiments were
carried out with a ~12 vol% ethanoleH2O feed, at temperatures of
310, 318, 328 and 334 K. Detailed results are reported elsewhere
[190], but major results are presented hereafter. The permeate flux
and ethanol wt% are presented in Table 17.

From the presented data it is clear that the permeate flux
significantly increases as the temperature increases, whilst the
ethanol membrane selectivity remains the same. At 334 K, the
permeate flux reaches 5.8 kg/m2 h.

From the observations of ethanol concentration in the permeate,
a higher feed temperature does not result in a higher ethanol
membrane selectivity. Since ethanol molecules have a larger size
than water, the assumption can be made that diffusion effects are
dominant over sorption effects, and are thus expected to be the
determining parameter in the transport mechanism description
through the PDMS-based membrane.

It is expected that the minor increase of the selectivity at higher
temperature is explained by a dependent decrease of the hydrogen
bonding between water and alcohol molecules. When this is the
case, less water is stimulated to permeate through the membrane.
Hence, not only membrane swelling seems to play an important
role during ethanol/water pervaporation but also the coupling ef-
fects between molecules, which tend to be lower at higher
temperatures.

To reduce the ethanol concentration in the fermenter below the
inhibition threshold limit of about 12 vol%, a hybrid system should
continuously at least remove 20e35% of the total fermenter broth
flow rates through the membrane. Although it is expected that the
continuous removal of ethanol will slightly increase the yield of the
fermenter, this was not accounted for in the calculations. At the

FPREMEATE 1⁄4 7920 kg=h:

The required membrane surface area at 334 K is 7920/
5.8 1⁄4 1366 m2. Although this surface area is considerable, it can be
reduced (i) by operating the pervaporation at as close a tempera-
ture as possible to the azeotropic point (~351 K), hence e.g. 348 K.
Extrapolating the T-dependent flux to 348 K, yields values of ~2.2 g/
m2s or 8 kg/m2h, leading to a reduction in membrane surface by
27.5%; (ii) by using a different membrane, as suggested in the
literature review of Table 15, where fluxes up to 10 kg/m2h at
comparable or higher selectivities were indicated, again indicating
a further decrease in membrane surface area of about 25%; or (iii)
by reducing the extracted flow of current 33% to a lower value,
however high enough to reduce the inhibition risk.

It is not reconsidered to operate the pervaporation membranes
at higher ethanol concentrations, hence e.g. in association with
VHG, since it was demonstrated by Chovau [191] that the selectivity
of all examined membranes is strongly dependent on the alcohol
content in the feed: a higher concentration of ethanol in the feed
led to a decrease in membrane selectivity. Similar observations
were found by Chen et al. [192], who investigated the performance
of unsupported filled silicone rubber membranes in the separation
of ethanol/water mixtures ranging between 4 and 91 wt% of
ethanol in the feed. The authors observed the highest selectivity
factor at 4 wt% ethanol (a 1⁄4 28.5), while the factors decreased
considerably at higher ethanol concentrations in the feed (a of 7.7
and 2.3 at 26 and 91 wt% of ethanol, respectively). This decrease
was explained by an extensive swelling of the PDMS rubber at
higher feed ethanol concentrations. According to Jia et al. [193],
incorporation of silicalite fillers in the polymeric network results in
a reduction of membrane swelling and moreover improves the
mechanical strength of the active layer.

The mass and heat balances around the complete unit, when
integrating pervaporation in a 33% side stream, as illustrated in
Fig. 10 before, revealed the following effect on the distillation plant
for a broth feed at 11.6 wt%.

The required steam amount is:

5.4. Overall assessment

The effect of the different possible improvements can be sum-

marized in a mass balance, as presented in Fig. 11.

It is evident that the use of VHG is recommended, since a
fermenter of the same volume can deal with about 30% more raw
material. The same applies to a lesser extent when pervaporation is
used to treat the fermenter broth. The combination of partial

5.5. The process of final ethanol dewatering to fuel grade

5.5.1.

Introduction

Since ethanol enrichment beyond the azeotropic mixture is
impossible by traditional distillation, specific alternatives need to
be employed.

There are 3 major techniques available to separate the etha-
nolewater azeotrope. Heterogeneous azeotropic distillation has
been widely studied in many papers and textbooks and widely
applied in the alcohol industry to dehydrate ethanol (e.g. 60% of
dehydration plants in Brazil are azeotropic distillation based).
However, heterogeneous azeotropic distillation reports some dis-
advantages associated with the high degree of nonlinearity,

- A highly selective and energy-saving separation process, with ~15%
lower costs in comparison to the batch process.
- The recovered ethanol concentration in the permeate was 67 wt%, and
the amount of recovered ethanol from the broth was more than 10
times higher than when using a non-coated membrane.
- Multi-stage pervaporation is needed to reach the fuel-grade quality of
the bio-ethanol.
- Yeasts, solid particles, and salts can increase ethanol flux and
selectivity;
- Integrated process can effectively eliminate product inhibition,
improve ethanol productivity, and enhance the glucose conversion rate.
- Pervaporative separation of bio-ethanol from the fermentation of
waste newspaper is possible without significantly decreasing process
performance.
- Possible but dependent on the feed concentration and operating
temperature for ethanol concentrations of 1e10%;
- Relatively good pervaporation performance with a total flux of 231
e252 g/m2 h.
- Increase of cell density, decreasing ethanol inhibition, improved
productivity and yield, and resumption of clean and concentrated
ethanol;
- Ethanol productivity increased by 26.83% over conventional batch
fermentation;
- Ethanol concentration in permeated side was 6e7 times higher than
that of the broth.
- Zeolite 13X filled CA membrane has the better pervaporation
performance;
- Application of CA membranes in industrial scale pervaporation units
may be feasible for separation of ethanol/water mixtures;
- Bio-ethanol can be produced economically (Using distillation and
pervaporation by hybrid systems).
- As a highly selective and energy-saving unit operation, membranes
have a great potential in the bio-ethanol industry, both for starch-based
and 2nd generation technology of bio-ethanol.
- Pervaporation membrane bioreactors (PVMBRs) and Membrane
distillation bioreactors (MDBRs) lead to higher ethanol productivity and
minimize the inhibition;
- Membrane hybrid processes further improve biorefining and
bioenergy production by decreasing energy consumption, reducing the
number of processing steps, and producing high quality final products.
- Pervaporation performance was strongly dependent on the feed
concentration and operating temperature;
- Ethanol fluxes were increased with the temperature increase;
- Lactic acid increased the hydrophilicity of the membrane.
- A separation factor of 40 and a flux of 1288 g/m2h with high long term
stabilitiy.

multiple steady states, distillation boundaries, long transients, and
heterogeneous liquideliquid equilibrium, limiting the operating
range of the system under different feed disturbances [194e198].
Extractive distillation is based on the introduction of a selective
solvent that interacts differently with each of the components
[196e199] of the original mixture and which generally shows a
strong affinity with one of the key components [197,200,201]. The
addition of an entraining agent, such as benzene, cyclohexane, or
heptane, forms a new ternary azeotrope comprising ethanol, water,
and the entraining agent. Since this lower-boiling ternary azeo-
trope is removed preferentially, water-free ethanol is obtained [10].
Extractive distillation is seldom used nowadays.

permeates). Membranes are often used in the so-called hybrid
membrane distillation process, where distillation and mem-
brane separation are combined, and the membrane operates
either in vapor permeation or in pervaporation mode, using
either a vapor membrane feed or a liquid membrane feed,
respectively.

(cid:7) applying a variety of other techniques, as discussed in literature,
i.e. a liquideliquid extraction of ethanol from an aqueous solu-
tion, the extraction of ethanol from the fermenter broth by su-
percritical CO2 [202,203], or the use of Pressure Swing
Adsorption [204].

These alternatives are only at the early stages of experimental

investigation.

The three main ethanol dehydration technologies will be
reviewed hereafter in order to establish the main operating con-
ditions required to obtain high purity ethanol.

5.5.2. Major processes

5.5.2.1. Azeotropic distillation with cyclohexane. Azeotropic distil-
lation uses a solvent with an intermediate boiling point to intro-
duce new azeotropes to the mixture and at the same time to
generate two liquid phases that allow, in a combined way, sepa-
rating ethanol from water. This technique although being widely
used has lost acceptance due to its poor stability and high energy
consumption. The first heterogeneous azeotropic distillation

Adsorption on molecular sieves takes advantage of the differ-
ence of the molecular size of ethanol and water molecules to
adsorb water molecules in a selective way and allowing ethanol
separation. The use of e.g. synthetic zeolite in pellet form, can
selectively adsorb water from the 95.6% ethanol solution. The
zeolite can be regenerated an unlimited number of times by drying.
Although a variety of plant-derived sorbents, including cornmeal,
straw, and sawdust can also absorb water, they cannot readily be
regenerated, but where ethanol is made from corn, cornmeal is
available at low cost.

In addition to these major technologies, other alternatives are

drawing increased attention, i.e:

(cid:7) the use of vacuum distillation: the composition of the etha-
nolewater azeotrope shifts to ethanol-rich mixtures at pres-
sures below atmospheric pressure, whilst
the azeotrope
disappears at pressures below 9.333 kPa, making it possible to
distill absolute ethanol from an ethanolewater mixture. Such
high vacuum operation is presently not economical.

(cid:7) applying pressure-swing distillation:

in this technique, a
reduced-pressure distillation first yields an ethanolewater
mixture of more than 95.6% ethanol. Then, fractional distillation
of this mixture at atmospheric pressure distills off the 95.6%
azeotrope, leaving anhydrous ethanol at the bottom.

(cid:7) using membranes to separate ethanol and water: since mem-
brane separations are not subject to the limitations of the
watereethanol azeotrope because separation is not based on
vaporeliquid equilibria, the selective permeation of one of the
components is possible by using either hydrophobic membranes
(water
(ethanol permeates) or hydrophilic membranes

column is designed to obtain high-purity ethanol product at the
column bottom while obtaining a minimum boiling etha-
nolewaterecyclohexane azeotrope at the top of the column. The
azeotrope obtained at the top is heterogeneous and the top vapor
stream is then condensed to form two liquid phases in the decanter
[200,205]. The organic phase containing mainly cyclohexane is
refluxed back to the heterogeneous azerotropic distillation column.
The aqueous phase is drawn from the decanter to be sent to the
entrainer recovery column where essentially pure water is obtained
as bottom stream, and at the top cyclohexane is removed to be
recycled to the first column. The organic reflux flow rate and the
recycle flow rate increase the ethanol concentration at the bottom
of the dehydration column, thus improving the separation perfor-
mance but also increasing the heat duties.

5.5.2.2. Extractive distillation with ethyleneglycol. Extractive distil-
lation is a partial vaporization process in the presence of a non-
volatile and high boiling point entrainer which does not form any
azeotropes with the original components of the azeotropic mixture.
The process has two columns: the extractive distillation column
and the entrainer recovery column. The entrainer is continuously
fed in one of the top stages of the extractive column while the
azeotropic feed is entered in a middle stage lower down the col-
umn. At the top of the extractive distillation column anhydrous
ethanol is obtained, and at the bottom stream a mixture of water-
eethyleneglycol is removed and sent to the second entrainer re-
covery column.
In the recovery column at the top water is
withdrawn with some traces of ethanol, and at the bottom high-
purity ethyleneglycol is recycled back to the extractive distillation
column [200]. The extractive distillation process with ethyl-
eneglycol shows some important advantages over azeotropic dis-
tillations, with makeup entrainer and quantity of entrainer being
lower, thus reducing the diameter of the columns. Additionally, the
energy consumption in the columns is reduced. On the other hand,
the most important variables used to achieve the desired ethanol
concentration are the entrainer to feed molar ratio and the reflux
ratio. The former has a limited effect on the energy consumption
compared with the reflux ratio impact on the reboiler duty.

5.5.2.3. Molecular sieves to dewater the azeotropic ethanoleH2O
mixture. A molecular sieve is a material with very small pores of
precise and uniform size: these holes are small enough to block
large molecules while allowing small molecules to pass. Many
molecular sieves are used as desiccants, silicagel being a major
example. Uniform cavities are present, which selectively adsorb
molecules of a specific size. The diameter of a molecular sieve is
measured in Angstroms (Å) or nanometres (nm 1⁄4 10 Å). According
to the IUPAC notation, microporous materials have pore diameters
less than 2 nm (20 Å) and macroporous materials have pore di-
ameters of exceeding 50 nm (500 Å). The mesoporous category
thus lies in the middle with pore diameters between 2 and 50 nm
(20e500 Å) [206].

Molecular sieves are used as adsorbent for gases and liquids,
where e.g. a water molecule may be small enough to enter the
pores while larger molecules are not: water is trapped and retained
into the pores, thus acting as a desiccant. A molecular sieve can
adsorb water up to 22% of its own weight [207].

Synthetic molecular sieves have improved desiccant capacities
[208], and novel sieves can also be used in synthetic organic pro-
cesses, frequently allowing isolation of desired products from
condensation reactions that are governed by generally unfavorable
equilibria [209]. They are also used in the filtration of air supplies
removing particulates and
[210],
for breathing equipment
compressor exhaust products from the breathing air supply.

Methods for regeneration of molecular sieves include a pressure
change (as in oxygen concentrators), heating and purging with a
carrier gas (as when used in ethanol dehydration), or heating under
high vacuum. Regeneration temperatures range from 448 K to
588 K depending on the molecular sieve type [209]. In contrast,
silicagel can be regenerated by heating at 393 K. Sufficient heat
must be applied to raise the temperature of the adsorbate, the
adsorbent and the vessel to vaporize the liquid and offset the heat
of wetting the molecular-sieve surface. The bed temperature is
sieve-specific towards regeneration. Bed temperatures in the
448e533 K range are usually employed for type 3 Å, whilst 4 Å, 5 Å
and 13X sieves require temperatures in the 473e588 K range. After
regeneration, a cooling period is necessary to reduce the molecular
sieve temperature to within 288 K of the temperature of the stream
to be processed. This is most conveniently done by using the same
gas stream as for heating, but without heat input. Small quantities
of molecular sieves may be dried in the absence of a purge gas by
oven heating followed by slow cooling in a closed system, such as a
desiccator [209].

A 4e8-mesh sieve is normally used in gas phase applications,
while the 8e12-mesh type is common in liquid phase applications.
The powder forms of the 3 Å, 4 Å, 5 Å and 13X sieves are suitable for
specialized applications [209]. The characteristics of common mo-
lecular sieves are given in Table 20. 3 Å molecular sieves do not
adsorb chemicals whose molecular diameters exceed 3 Å. The
characteristics of these molecular sieves include fast adsorption
speed, frequent regeneration ability, good crushing resistance and
pollution resistance. The characteristics of common molecular
sieves are given in Table 20, with full details provided in Ref. [209].
In the traditional molecular sieve process, as illustrated in
Fig. 12, the azeotropic feed is superheated to >393 K, and sent to
one of the sieve columns, while the other column is being regen-
erated (release of adsorbed water).

The column regeneration is performed using superheated dry
ethanol, condensed and returned to the final distillation column of
the bio-ethanol process as “light ethanol”.

Both columns adsorb and regenerate alternately, and ensure the
uninterrupted continuous production. The recovered heat in the
condensers can be used in the low temperature reboilers (distilla-
tion) or for preheating.

The mass and energy balances of the molecular sieve process for
a typical 200,000 tpa bio-ethanol plant [211] are given in Table 21.

5.5.2.4. Comparison. Within the pre-cited technologies of extrac-
tive distillation, ethyleneglycol is preferred above of the other
solvents such as benzene, glycerol or others. Azeotropic distillation
with hexane or other solvents has been abandoned because of high
investment and operation costs ((cid:3)30% above glycol extractive
distillation) [212].

Molecular sieves are now commonly used to produce pure
ethanol (>99.5%), despite the investment, the high tonnage of
molecular sieve needed, and the steam consumption being major
drawbacks.

5.5.3. Production of anhydrous ethanol using hydrophilic
membranes

Initial experiments were conducted according to the procedures
described by Dotremont et al. [213]. A Dow Filmtech membrane
(BW30XLE) was installed with a surface of 20 cm2. Details are given
in Kang et al. [163]. The data, as represented in Table 22, demon-
strate that the permeate flux is significantly influenced by the
operating temperature, whilst the ethanol selectivity remains
nearly constant for T > 318 K.

The T-enhanced flux values are inherently due to the solution-
diffusion action of the membrane, facilitated by the enhanced

molecular mobility at higher temperatures. To further increase the
flux, it is recommended to increase the temperature close to the
boiling point of the azeotropic mixture.

Applied as example to the Cofco plant [24,25], a mass balance
determines the required membrane surface area. According to the
data of Table 21, the final ethanolewater distillation produces an
average 27,150 kg/h at 94.4 wt% ethanol, hence containing 1512 kg/
h of water and 25,638 kg/h of ethanol. Molecular sieves dewater the
ethanol to a purity of ~99.7wt% ethanol, i.e. removing 1314 kg/h of
water.

For this amount of water to be eliminated (1314 kg/h), the total
permeate flow (at 44.4 wt% ethanol) will be 2363 kg/h. The anhy-
drous ethanol retentate (>99.7 wt%) will be 24,786 kg/h. The
permeate, at 44.4 wt% of ethanol, needs to be recycled to the final
distillation column, where it consists less than 2% of the feed mass
flow rate. For operation at 335 K, the required surface area of the
membrane is hence fixed at 2363 (kg/h)/23.78 (kg/m2h) or 92 m2.

For the desiccation of e.g. 200,000 ton/year of ethanol, the in-
vestment of the molecular sieve unit exceeds 1 MV, including 160
ton of 3 Å molecular sieve. The annual steam consumption will be
96,000 ton, requiring ~7000 ton of fuel in the steam boiler. For the
membrane application, the investment including feeding pump,
vacuum pump and condenser, is estimated at ~0.3 MV [214,215].
Since no steam is required (the feed is delivered between 333 and
363 K after the final watereethanol distillation column), only
~50 kWh needs to be accounted for as operating costs, representing
a significant energy saving in comparison with the current molec-
ular sieve unit.

It is clear that hydrophilic membranes can be a valid alternative,
without steam addition and with a minimum electrical power
required to overcome the transmembrane pressure and create the
permeate vacuum.

5.6.1. Cross-flow microfiltration of bio-ethanol fermentation broth

5.6.1.1.
Introduction. Bio-ethanol fermentation broth consists of
mainly water and ethanol, together with solid residues of un-
reacted feedstock and additives (mostly yeast). Prior to further
processing (distillation), and to avoid fouling of heat exchangers
and distillation columns, the solid residues of the broth need to be

can only

remove þ 10 mm particles representing about 90% of the total solids
content. The remaining 10% is usually recovered in the bottom
stream of the first distillation column, and forms the stillage. To
avoid fouling and even eliminate the first distillation column where
the ethanol fraction is only increased from 12% (feed) to 16% (top), a
better solids removal is required. The sintered metal fiber (SFM)
fleeces are highly efficient for microfiltration and the removal of
suspended solids largely exceeds 99% [216]. Properties of SFM fil-
ters are illustrated in Table 23, indicating the range of very fine fi-
bers used, the low thickness of the fleece, and the fair to excellent
permeability.

The major applications of microfiltration are situated at different
levels, i.e. (i) in the harvesting and pre-treatment of algal biomass,
hence in item 1 in Fig. 2 [217]; (ii) to filtrate the broth before the

wastewater treatment, hence integrated in item 6 of Fig. 2. The
benefits of introducing membrane techniques are now recognized
[186,218e220], although extensive research is still needed to
scientifically and economically justify their application.

5.6.1.2. Solids' characteristics of the fermentation broth. The broth
solid residue mainly consists of non-converted feedstock and yeast.
Typical particle size distributions are illustrated in Fig. 13 for a corn-
based fermentation. Traditional particle separation techniques,
with a cut-size of 5e10 mm, can indeed only separate about 90% of
the suspended particles.

The residual 10% of fines is usually separated in the bottom
stream of the first distillation column, contains mostly yeasts, and
forms the stillage. If microfiltration were to be used, it would need
to also separate the <5e10 mm particles.

5.6.1.3. Microfiltration results. Irrespective of the operating condi-
tions, the membranes tested were nearly total barriers for the
suspended solids, with a >99% retention [221]. The permeate flux
was a strong function of TMP and values are given at a backpulse
every 20 s. Fluxes up to 22.5 m3/m2 h were measured at low con-
centrations (~1 g/L), but reduced to between 10 and 5 m3/m2 h at
yeast concentrations of 3e30 g/L respectively [221].

For a large-scale application, the concentration of solids in the
broth suspension after 90% removal by traditional mechanical
separation, will be about 35 T in ~2400 T of H2O/ethanol. Since the
treatment of the fermenter broth is spread over a period of about
60 h, the total broth flow of 2400 m3 requires a filtration capacity of
40 m3/h. The microfiltration feed concentration will be around 15 g/
L. At such a concentration, the microfiltration flux will be around
5 m3/m2h. Using the obtained flux values, an SFM of 8 m2 is
therefore required [221].

To enable the use of the experimental results for different sus-
pensions and in scaling-up, a model was developed, based upon the
stagnant film theory [221]. The model predicts the steady-state
permeate flux of cross-flow microfiltration with a fair accuracy
(error << 10%).

5.6.2. Novel distillation concepts

Considering that the partial pressure of ethanol is higher than
that of water, ethanol vapor can transfer preferentially through the
membrane pores, thus favoring the use of membrane distillation to
separate ethanol and water. The selectivity is determined by
ethanol volatility. There are very few studies about separating the
ethanolewater solution using membrane distillation [222,223],
although initial results also reveal that it can improve the ethanol
productivity due to the simultaneous removal of trace-inhibitors.

Main results

- Lower investment and operating costs, and reducing the equipment and
carbon footprint;
- Energy savings of 10e20%.
- Savings in total annual cost (32%) for a feed stream with 22 wt% ethanol

- Only one column shell is used in combination (one condenser and two
reboilers);
- Savings on energy total investment and annual costs are about 17%.
- Energy savings of 10e20% and less equipment units.
- DWC as the key separation unit for large scale dehydration of pre-concentrated
bioethanol;
- Energy savings of 10e20%, and less equipment units.

Direct membrane distillation and air gap membrane distillation
coupled with fermentation are possible configurations for ethanol
production. Udriot et al. [224] integrated direct membrane distil-
lation with fermentation for the separation of ethanol from the
culture medium. The results showed an 87% increase in ethanol
(cid:2)1. Lewandowicz et al. [225]
productivity from 0.99 to 1.85 g L
reported that the ethanol production increased by 15.5% due to
facilitation of the continuous process, more complete fermentation
of sugars, lowering the osmotic pressure in the fermentation broth,
decreasing the glycerol synthesis level and increasing yeast cells
number and viability. In addition to improve the ethanol produc-
tivity, membrane performance is another research focus. Studies
indicate that the temperature has an important influence on
membrane flux [226].

(cid:2)1 h

Current studies have been confined to lab-scale as illustrated in
Table 24, and larger scale performance needs to be further
investigated.

Moreover the membrane selectivity is relative low, ranging from
1 to 7 only, thus making the development of high performance
membrane material an important focus of research in membrane
distillation. Pilot-scale applications are certainly required to
confirm the lab-scale findings.

5.6.3. The improved bio-ethanol production plant

From the results reported in the paper, it is clear that the current
flow sheet and mass balance, as presented in Figs. 5 and 7, can be
substantially modified to take advantages of recent improvements.
Fig. 14 summarizes the authors' views on an improved production
process, integrating different unit operations.

The batch fermentation will be performed in VHG-mode (1),
with ethanol concentration between 12 and 15 wt%. To reduce the
stress on the bacteria in the fermenter, a fraction of the ethanol will
be continuously removed during fermentation by a pervaporation
membrane (3). Ethanol-rich permeate will be fed to the 2nd
distillation stage, whist the ethanol-lean fraction will be recycled to
the fermenter. To prevent fouling of the pervaporation membrane,
suspended solids of the fermentation broth will be removed by
microfiltration (2) and recycled to the fermenter. Suspended solids
of the fermentation broth will be removed by a combined me-
chanical (>10 mm) and microfiltration (<10 mm) step, respectively
indicated as (4) and (5).

Solids' residues will be as currently produced, both into DDGS
(6), and as wastewater to be anaerobically digested (7), with its
biogas feeding a CHP unit to provide heat and electricity (8). Due to
the use of a microfiltration, the first Cofco-like distillation column

can be eliminated, since the stillage is removed by microfiltration. A
2-stage distillation (9.1 and 9.2) will be sufficient to produce the
azeotropic ethanolewater mixture. Anhydrous ethanol can then be
produced by hydrophilic membranes (10) and stored (11). As will
be shown in the following tentative economic assessment, the
process sequence as described above, offers both investment ben-
efits (e.g. less fermenter volume, less distillation needs,...) and
reduced production costs.

6. Preliminary economic assessment

The full production cost of bio-ethanol at Cofco in 2013 is re-
ported at 820 V/ton bio-ethanol. Based upon the predictions of the
previous sections, a tentative cost calculation per ton bio-ethanol
can be made, for a plant depreciation of 25 years, and other costs
calculated on the basis of common ratios or literature data [232].
The efficiency of the steam boiler is estimated at 85%. For sake of
comparison, the use of corn of sugarcane is also included.

The required raw materials cassava, corn and sugarcane are
considered at 6.6, 3.2 and 13.5 ton/ton bio-ethanol respectively,
with current costs (delivered at the plant) of respectively 38.6
[232], 220 [125] and 34.5 [233] V/ton of raw material. Through a
similar approach, and based upon the estimated investment costs
of the membrane modules, the impact of both hybrid fermentation
and substitution of molecular sieves by membrane dehydration can
be calculated. The life span of the membrane modules is estimated
at 10 years, with a replacement of the membranes every 4 years.
Results are illustrated in Fig. 15.

Since the calculated production cost for cassava-based bio-
ethanol (830 V/ton) is comparable with the Cofco-cited 820 V/ton,
the proposed calculation procedure appears fair and acceptable.

It is therefore evident that the production cost by both applying
a VHG fermentation, and substituting molecular sieves by a
membrane process, can reduce the total production cost by ~90 V/
ton bio-ethanol, i.e. about 11%.

Further research of the different alternatives, preferably on pilot
scale, appears economically and technically justified. Cellulosic
biomass could be a valid feed stock provided its cost of supply and
required pretreatment can compete with the equivalent costs for
cassava.

based) have been well documented and are largely applied, the
second and third generation of bio-ethanol processes (cellulose- or
algae-based) need further research and development since bio-
ethanol yields are still too low to be economically viable. Applica-
tions of bio-ethanol mostly target the combined use with petrol.
The conversion pathways for the production of bio-ethanol from
disaccharides, from starches, and from lignocellulosic biomass
were analyzed. The yield of the fermentation fixes the total energy
needed during the downstream separation processes, mostly by
distillation. Mass and energy balances of the common processing
routes were presented. To compare field data with common engi-
neering design simulations, the software Aspen Plus V8.2 was used.
Field and simulation results showed an excellent agreement.
Without energy recovery, 2.5 kg steam/kg ethanol are required.
Possible energy improvements through 5 modifications were
examined and demonstrated that an internal energy re-use, the
application of VHG, or the application of a hybrid operation mode
(pervaporation) could reduce the steam use per kg of bio-ethanol to
1.18, 1.17, 0.94 and 1.13 kg steam/kg bio-ethanol for options of
energy-pinch, VHG (15%), VHG (19%) and pervaporation, respec-
tively. A further energy saving can be achieved in the ethanol
dewatering to fuel grade. Whilst molecular sieves are now
commonly used, the use of hydrophilic membranes was high-
lighted and confirmed by literature and experimental results,
yielding a significant energy saving in comparison with the mo-
lecular sieve units. Additional technologies to improve the opera-
tion of the ethanolewater separation, include microfiltration of the
broth before the distillation (and pervaporation, in a hybrid sys-
tem), and membrane distillation. Whereas the benefits of intro-
ducing these techniques are recognized, extensive research is still
needed to scientifically and economically justify their application. A
tentative economic assessment demonstrated that the application
of process improvements can lead to production cost savings of
~11%. Further research of the different alternatives, preferably on
pilot or large scale, appears economically and technically justified.
