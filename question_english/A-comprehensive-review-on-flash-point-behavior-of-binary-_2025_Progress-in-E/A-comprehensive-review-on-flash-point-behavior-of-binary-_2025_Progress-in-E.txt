The  flash  point  (FP)  behavior  of  binary  ignitable  mixtures,  which  are  the  simplest  form  of  mixtures  and
fundamental building blocks, is essential for understanding multicomponent mixture behavior. This knowledge
plays a vital role in process and chemical safety as well as in fuel design. In the present review, the FP of 245
independent binary ignitable mixtures, composed of 102 individual pure compounds derived from 69 published
articles, was investigated. The mixtures based on their chemical class were categorized. Investigations on their
ideal  or  extreme  FP  behaviors  revealed  that  certain  combinations  have  a  higher  potential  for  demonstrating
extreme  FP  behaviors  such  as  alcohol  + aromatic  hydrocarbon,  alcohol  + ester,  alcohol  + alkane,  aromatic
hydrocarbon + organic acid, alcohol + organic acid, phenol + alcohol, phenol + ketone, and phenol + pyridine.
It was found that the occurrence of extreme FP behaviors is not only related to the chemical class but also to the
molecular structure, the non-ideality of binary mixture, and the temperature gap between FP values of the pure
constituents  in  each  binary  blend.  These  findings  can  be  utilized  to  enhance  the  safety  level  of  processes  or
operations  involving  these  binary  mixtures.  Furthermore,  this  information  can  be  valuable  in  fuel  design  for
specific purposes and improve combustion, thanks to a comprehensive knowledge regarding the FP tendencies of
each binary category and the potential for extreme FP behaviors.

1. Introduction

1.1. Concept of flash point

The flash point (FP) refers to the minimum temperature at which a
volatile ignitable substance could vaporize enough to develop an ignit-
able blend with air. It is the temperature at which the vapor above a
liquid or solid substance can be ignited momentarily (producing a flash
fire) upon contact with a source of heat, spark, or flame. The flash fire
occurs at this temperature, lasting only briefly and extinguishes if the
ignition source is removed. This behavior distinguishes the FP from the
fire point, which is the temperature at which the mixture can sustain a
continuous flame. Notably, the fire point temperature is always higher
than the FP [1]. FP is a crucial criterion for assessing the flammability
and fire hazard of a substance or a blend. The lower the FP, the more
easily the substance can ignite and the greater the risk of fire and ex-
plosion (F&E) [2]. FP is often used to classify ignitable materials and to
determine appropriate handling, storage, and transportation procedures
[3,4]. FP is a critical safety parameter; however, maintaining a high FP is
not the only method for preventing F&E hazards. For instance, gasoline,
which typically has a FP of (cid:0) 40
C or lower, remains inherently safe
within vehicle fuel tanks because its vapor pressure exceeds the upper
flammability limit (UFL), rendering the vapor concentration too rich to
ignite. This strategy is also commonly employed in industrial processes
by maintaining concentrations significantly above the UFL to mitigate
explosion  risks  [5].  In  contrast,  for  fuels  such  as  diesel  and  jet  fuel,
regulations  mandate a minimum  FP to ensure  that the vapor concen-
tration above the fuel stays below the lower flammability limit (LFL),
thereby reducing the likelihood of ignition [6]. In these scenarios, the
FP—representing  the  temperature  at  which  the  vapor  concentration
reaches the LFL—serves as a fundamental safety parameter.

measurement process are presented.

1.2. FP behavior of ignitable mixtures

Knowing the FP behavior of mixtures is crucial because a non-ideal

behavior of these mixtures was reported frequently, resulting in possible
extremal FP that can increase F&E risk in the case of lower FP behavior.
In an A–B mixture exhibiting an ideal behavior, components interactions
A–A or A–B show no specific difference and the mixture behavior adhere
to Raoult’s law about the Vapor–Liquid Equilibrium (VLE), stating that
the vapor pressure of each constituent in the blend is proportionate to its
concentration  in  the  liquid  phase.  However,  in  a  non-ideal  mixture,
positive  (higher  vapor  pressure)  or  negative  (lower  vapor  pressure)
deviations  from  Raoult’s  law  occur,  resulting  in  possible  extreme
behavior in mixtures, like azeotropy and extreme FP. Da Cunha et al. [7]
have  shown  the  relation  between  maximum  (resp.  minimum)  boiling
azeotropic behavior and minimum (resp. maximum) FP occurrences in
binary  mixtures  of  flammable  compounds.  Both  physical  effects,  like
steric  hindrance,  and  chemical  effects  (from  weak  interactions  via
hydrogen  bonding  to  strong  chemical  association)  are  responsible  for
non-ideal behavior [8] and it depends on factors such as polarity and
molecular size and the mole fraction of each constituent and the nature
of the chemicals involved. This manifests in the VLE by the occurrence of
either  activity  or  fugacity  coefficients,  which  equal  unity  for  ideal
mixtures  [9].  Non-ideal  mixtures  with  high  enough  deviation  from
ideality  may  exhibit  either  of  extreme  FP  behaviors:  minimum  FP
behavior  (MinFPB)  or  maximum  FP  behavior  (MaxFPB)  [10,11].  The
primary driving force for the MinFPB is the interaction weakening effect
as the mixture compounds are mixed (repulsive force); while conversely,
the  force  typically  responsible  for  causing  MaxFPB  is  the  interaction
strengthening  (attractive  force).  The  extreme  FP  behaviors  manifest
when the inter-species forces exceed those within a single species at the
molecular level, causing the vapor pressure and FP of the solution to be
affected [2]. Fig. 2 illustrates the relation of MinFPB and MaxFPB with
the  repulsive  and  attractive  forces,  respectively.  In  one  study,  the
MinFPB was denoted with the alternative term “synergistic behavior”
[12]. Furthermore, in a different study [9], the demonstration of mini-
mum FP behavior was attributed to the term “MFPB”.

A mixture with MinFPB demonstrates a sufficient positive deviation
from ideality that has the potential to display FP that is lower than the
individual components in specific compositions; thereby increasing the
risk of ignition. On the other hand, a mixture with MaxFPB displays a
considerable  negative  deviation  from  the  ideal  state.  In  a  mixture
exhibiting  MaxFPB,  the  FP  of  the  blend,  in  certain  mole  fractions,  is
greater than the FPs of its individual components. Thus, the F&E risk of a
blend showing MaxFPB would be less than the pure constituents [13].
Fig. 3 presents a conceptual illustration of the MinFPB and MaxFPB.

The  importance  of  studying  extreme  FP  behaviors  lies  in  their
capability to drive a chemical process into unfavorable situations. It is

critical  to  develop  a  thorough  understanding  of  a  mixture’s  FP  while
designing  a  chemical  process  to  ensure  that  it  operates  within  safe
operational boundaries. This plays a crucial role in averting accidents
and enhancing the overall efficiency of the process. Moreover, when it
comes  to  storage  and  transportation,  these  MinFPB  and  MaxFPB  pa-
rameters become instrumental in ascertaining the suitable storage con-
ditions  and  transportation  approaches,  thereby  guaranteeing  the  safe
handling of the mixture. FP behavior is also beneficial in F&E hazard
assessments, particularly in determining the flammability of a released
(or spilled) liquid [14]. The notable correlation between flame spread
rates  and  both  fuel  temperature  and  the  FP  of  the  fuel  mixture  was
determined  [15].  Therefore,  in  the  context  of  fuel  design,  FP  holds  a
substantial  importance  as  it  facilitates  the  attainment  of  desired  fuel
properties, consequently leading to improved combustion performance
[2].

1.3. Objectives of the review

The objective of this investigation is to offer a more holistic insight
into the FP behavior of ignitable mixtures and introduce an easy-to-use
approach  for  issuing  initial  notices  about  the  potential  occurrence  of
extreme  FP  behaviors.  FP  of  binary  mixtures  have  been  studied  in
numerous  studies  by  different  approaches  such  as  experimental  mea-
surements  (e.g.,  open  cup  and  closed-cup),  correlative  models  (e.g.,
mathematical regression approaches), and predictive models (e.g., mo-
lecular structures and thermodynamic equilibrium approaches) [2]. In
this  study,  the  binary  mixtures  that  were  subjected  to  experimental
measurements are discussed, and studies lacking experimental data are
not  incorporated  into  this  review.  Although  a  substantial  amount  of
experimental  data  is  presented  that  might  be  a  valuable  resource  for
scholars and engineers seeking experimental FP data on ignitable binary
mixtures, the primary aim of this review is to analyze the extreme FP
behavior  of  binary  ignitable  mixtures  and  to  validate  the  proposed
theories on this behavior with real-world data and to contribute to the
practical application of ignitable mixtures in safety and fuel design. This
approach also highlights the prevalence of extermal FP behavior across
different  chemical  classes.  Therefore,  detailed  descriptions  of  the
experimental data are included in the Appendix and Supplemental In-
formation,  emphasizing  that  presenting  these  data  is  not  the  central
purpose of the review.

In  this  study,  each  binary  mixture  is  investigated  based  on  their
chemical  class,  experimental  measurement  approaches,  and  applied
predictive  models.  Two  extreme  FP  behaviors  of  the  binary  mixture
(MinFPB  and  MaxFPB) are  discussed  based  on their  chemical  classes,

factors  affecting  their  behaviors,  safety,  and  fuel  design  implications.
Furthermore, some suggestions for future studies are presented.

this  study,  as  their  FP  behaviors  are  not  applicable  in  the  context  of
extreme behaviors.

This review discusses models for predicting FP behavior only within
the boundaries relevant to its primary focus. Previous comprehensive
reviews, such as Phoon et al. (2014) on classical FP models [16] and
Costa  do  Nascimento  et  al.  (2024)  on  empirical  models  [17],  have
already provided detailed examinations of predictive methods for the
FPs of pure substances and mixtures.

1.4. Content overview and methods

For  the  current  review,  the  authors  collected  all  accessible  data
regarding  the  FP  of  binary  mixtures  by  conducting  searches  using
phrases  such  as  “FP  of  binary  mixture”,  “FP  investigation  of  binary
blends”, “FP of chemical or ignitable mixtures”, and so forth in scientific
search  engines  such  as  “Web  of  Science”  and  “Google  Scholar”.  It  is
noteworthy that for this review, that only binary mixtures in which both
components were classified as ignitable chemicals were chosen. Other
binary  mixtures,  such  as  aqueous-organic  mixtures—despite  being
ignitable within certain compositional ranges [18]—are excluded from

The FP behaviors of 245 reported binary mixtures are considered. It
is  found  through  numerous  studies  that not  all binary  mixtures  show
ideal FP behavior. Instead, non-ideal or highly non-ideal FP behavior, in
severe cases, has been documented. To gain a deeper understanding of
extreme  FP  behaviors,  the  reported  binary  blends  from  69  published
articles are examined based on their properties, with a primary focus on
the MinFPB and MaxFPB. The initial step involved the categorization of
all  the  reported  binary  mixtures  according  to  the  chemical  classes  of
their components. Fig. 4 displays the pure ignitable chemicals used in
the  studied  binary  mixtures  along  with  their  molecular  structure.
Additionally, Table S1 (Supplemental Information) provides details on
ignitable chemicals, including with their respective CAS numbers. The
subsequent step is to examine the features of mixtures in each category
demonstrating  extreme  FP  behaviors.  In  the  next  step,  a  statistical
analysis is conducted to reveal the frequency of extreme FP behaviors in
each category of binary blends. In the end, recommendations are pro-
vided based on the findings.

2. Experimental techniques

The experimentally obtained FP data are greatly influenced by fac-
tors such as the type of FP tester (closed-cup and open cup), the mea-
surement  standard  (ASTM  and  ISO  with  different  heating  rates),  test
conditions (stirring or static conditions), and purity of ignitable chem-
icals [3,19,20].

While there is no correlation between the measurement method type
and the FP behavior of binary mixtures, this section delves into various
FP measurement approaches: closed-cup and open cup methods.

In the open cup approach, the test cup does not have a cover, and it is
in direct contact with the ambient air during the experiment. In the open
system, a portion of the ignitable mixture escapes from the container
since there is no barrier to hinder the escape of vapor into the atmo-
sphere. Consequently, this leads to an overestimation of FP because less
ignitable vapor exists above the liquid surface. The open cup test may be
used in research or other technical settings where open conditions are
under investigation, such as spill scenarios or open vessels [21].

Closed-cup FP tests offer a closer representation of real-world sce-
narios where liquids are stored or transported in sealed containers with
limited  air  access  [21].  In  the  closed-cup  method,  the  cup  is  not  in
continuous contact with the surrounding air. In fact, at specific intervals
controlled  by  the  applied  standard,  the  container  is  opened,  and  the
ignition source comes into contact with the ignitable vapor mixture at
the top of the cup.

The FP achieved using the closed-cup method has typically a lower
temperature  compared  to  the  open  cup  approach.  This  difference  is
expected because the vapors within a closed cup tester are more likely to
meet the state of ignition since they are less prone to diffusion to the
external environment, unlike the open cup method [19]. Particularly,
when dealing with blends, the heating of the ignitable sample initiates
the evaporation process that in an open cup apparatus could introduce
measurement  errors  [15,22].  It  has been  shown that  there  is  a  linear
association  between  FPs  achieved  using  open  cup  and  closed-cup  ap-
proaches [23]; however, the closed-cup FP is preferred for safety studies
[24] since it presents more reliable FP data [25].

For  illustration,  the  FP  measurement  of 1-butanol  + ethylbenzene
demonstrates the difference between the measured FP of an open cup
versus a closed cup approach. In a study conducted by Lakzian and Liaw
(2021), the FP measurement was performed by a closed-cup FP tester
(HFP 362-Tag) based on ASTM D56 in which the FP values of 1-butanol,
ethylbenzene,  and  the  minimum  FP  (minFP)  were  36.8,  24.6,  and
◦
21.2
C, respectively [2]. However, in another study on the same binary

mixture  by  Ha  and  Lee  (2008)  that  was  conducted  by  an  open  cup
apparatus  (Flash  Tester  Koehler)  based  on  ASTM  D1310-86,  the FP
values of 1-butanol, ethylbenzene, and the minFP were 42.5, 30.5, and
◦
C, respectively [26]. As evident, there exists a substantial disparity
26.5
in  the  FP  values  between  these  two  measurement  methods,  with  the
C in all three compositions. This discrepancy
differences exceeding 5
was also apparent in other research studies, such as Lakzian and Liaw
(2021) and Ha and Lee (2015a), focusing on the 1-butanol + acetic acid
blend.

◦

A comparison of four binary mixtures studied under different mea-
surement methods is presented in Fig. 5. It is evident that, despite var-
iations in measurement methods and applied standards, the FP behavior
and trend lines for the mixtures are identical. This indicates that, when
measurements are conducted under standard conditions, the observed
FP  behavior  remains  consistent.  However,  minor  discrepancies  may
arise due to factors such as the purity of ignitable chemicals, the type of
FP tester used, the measurement standard applied, and the specific test
conditions. Notably, the discrepancies observed across various compo-
sitions  between  two  different  methods  can  be  adjusted,  as  these  de-
viations  tend  to  converge  with  the  deviations  in  the  FPs  of  the  pure
compounds.

The closed-cup FP apparatuses that typically were used in the studies
can be referred to as HFP 362-Tag (based on standard: ASTM D56) [3],
Setaflash Series 8 (ASTM D3278) [27], MINIFLASH FLPL (ASTM D7094)
[28],  HFP  360-Pensky  Martens  (ASTM  D93B)  [29],  ISL  FP  analyzer
(ASTM  93A)  [30],  Pensky-Martens  PM1  (EN  ISO  2719)  [31],  Rapid
Flash Tester Koehler (ASTM D3278) [32], SDM 930 (ASTM D3941) [33],
Mini-FLASH TOUCH (ASTM D6450) [34], WFY-111C (unknown stan-
dard) [35], CCCFP (ASTM D6450) [36], and ERAFLASH Eralytics (ASTM
D56) [37].

Furthermore,  the  open  cup  FP  testers  employed  in  the  FP  studies
discussed  in  this review  can  be named  as  Rapid  Flash Tester  Koehler
(ASTM D1310-86) [38], Open cup B130 (ASTM D1310) [39], Tag open
cup Koehler apparatus (ASTM D1310) [40], and Cleveland (ASTM D92)
[41]. Fig. 6 displays the FP apparatuses utilized to study the FP of binary
mixtures in this review.

The values of repeatability (r) and reproducibility (R) are critical for
ensuring  the  precision  of  experimental  data  obtained  in  laboratories.
Table 1 summarizes these values as defined by the standards referenced
in the original articles cited in this review.

3. Theoretical models and predictive approaches

The action of modeling has always been valuable in science for un-
derstanding phenomena and fitting experimental data, thereby enabling
the identification of the underlying physico-chemical processes. From its
definition, the key physico-chemical phenomena related to FP include
vaporization, related to VLE and boiling point, and combustion, related
to  the  chemical  reaction  with  oxygen  in  the  air.  This  has  prompted
various  approaches  to  FP  modeling,  ranging  from  simpler  correlative
methods based on boiling point and molecular size to those considering
atom  numbers [9,49,50]  or  models based  on thermodynamic  equilib-
rium, either with liquid phase fugacity coefficient from an equation of
state approach [51–53] or with a liquid phase activity coefficient [54,
55] to describe deviation from Raoult’s law ideal behavior. Fig. 7 out-
lines methods for studying the FP behavior of ignitable mixtures [2]. It is
important to note that all popular models for the FP of pure compounds
or mixtures neglect the presence of air. According to its definition, FP
requires air in the vapor phase for combustion, but it is assumed in phase
equilibrium modeling to be absent from the liquid phase in equilibrium
with the vapor phase. This assumption makes models, including Liaw’s
equilibrium  model,  approximate  since  the  complete  system  is  in  a
non-equilibrium  state  because  the  chemical  potential  of  air  differs  in
each  phase.  Even  so,  the  near  "VLE"  model  works  quite  well  for  all
non-air compounds [56].

In the majority of the studies presented within this review, predictive

models relying on thermodynamic equilibrium were used to describe the
experimental measurement of binary mixtures. This enabled a compar-
ison of the mathematical models’ performance and real-world FP data.
The  simplest  VLE  model  is  Raoult’s  law  that  assumes  there  is  no
difference to a specific molecule whether it is immersed in molecules of
the  same  kind  or  different  kinds  in  a  mixture,  since  the  interactions
between them are identical [57]. Raoult’s law approach describes ideal
behavior that cannot predict nor describe extremal FP occurrence. White
et al. (1997) and Affens and McLaren (1972) also failed to accurately
predict the FP of mixtures exhibiting significant non-ideal behavior, as
both models relied on the assumption of Raoult’s law [15,19]. These two
models  are  primarily  used  for  FP  prediction  of  ideal  or  nearly  ideal
mixtures  [54].  Catoire’s  model  (2006)  was  unable  to  predict  the  FP
behavior of binary mixtures when components originated from different
organic classes [33,58]. The model of Wickey et al. (1963) which has
been  developed  for  FP  prediction  of  petroleum  mixtures  fell  short  of
capturing the non-ideality of blends [33,59]. These models are unable to
anticipate  the  FP  of  blends  with  significant  deviations  from  ideality,
which leads to either MinFPB or MaxFPB.

Regarding non-ideal mixtures, Liaw’s model, which relies on a VLE
modeling with liquid activity coefficients has proven in most of cases to
predict satisfactorily the FP behavior of both ideal and non-ideal mix-
tures [60]. However, it is important to note that this model performance
depends on the accuracy of the liquid activity coefficients acquired from
the  activity  coefficient  models  such  as  the  Non-Random  Two-Liquid

QUAC),  van  Laar,  Margules,  and  Universal  Quasi-Chemical  Functio-
nal-group  Activity  Coefficients  (UNIFAC)-based  models.  The  NRTL,
Wilson,  van  Laar,  Margules  or  UNIQUAC  models  required  binary
interaction parameters that must be regressed on experimental data, like
readily available VLE data. In that case, FP prediction performance was
found very accurate, even when dealing with blends containing organic
acids.  When  no  binary  interaction  parameters  are  available,  models
based on group contribution parameters (UNIFAC-based models) can be
used. There exist several sub-class of UNIFAC-based models but they did
not yield satisfactory results in FP prediction with Liaw’s model for some
of the mixtures containing organic acids [3].

The Conductor-like Screening Model for Real Solvents (COSMO-RS)

is a model used to predict activity coefficients and other thermodynamic
properties. When combined with a modified version of Liaw’s mixing
rule [61], with the condition that the LFL must correspond to the satu-
ration vapor pressure. This approach has been applied to estimate the FP
behavior of some binary ignitable mixtures [62,63].

Among  the  245  binary  mixtures  discussed  in  this  review,  Liaw’s
model was used in the FP prediction of 205 binary mixtures, Raoult’s
law in 100, COSMO-RS along with modified liaw’s mixing rule in 15,
White et al.’s equation in 8, Wickey model in 6, Catoire model in 6, and
Affens and McLaren model in 4.

Liaw’s model is based on Le Chatelier’s rule (1891), which can be

expressed as follows [64]:

volume percent, where xi  is  the molar fraction of component i in the
vapor phase (only accounting for ignitable compounds), and LFLi  is the

4. Binary mixtures and their FP behaviors

4.1. Binary mixtures comprise alcohols

The  FP  behavior  of  binary  mixtures  containing  alcohols  has  been
studied  extensively,  and  alcohols  are  among  the  most  commonly
observed  chemicals  in  FP  studies  of  binary  mixtures.  The  decision  to
initially introduce binary mixtures containing alcohols is driven by the
abundant  and  well-documented  data  available  in  numerous  articles
concerning these compounds.

In the following sections, the binary blends are organized into their
respective classes. To enhance clarity, each subsection only shows the
mixtures that fall within the category, and those mixtures exclusively
will be discussed in that subsection.

The FP behavior of mixtures comprising two alcohols has been re-
ported in several studies. The names of these mixtures, along with the
corresponding references providing the experimental FP data, are pre-
sented in Table 2. In ignitable mixtures, the observation of either of the
two  extreme  FP  behaviors  is  possible:  MinFPB  or  MaxFPB.  However,
none  of the  aforementioned  binary  blends demonstrated  any of  these
extreme FP behaviors. It is crucial to emphasize that most of the alcohols
investigated  in  these  studies  had  the  same  structures  (chained  or
branched alcohols) with variation only being in the number of carbon in
their structures. Except for cyclohexanol and benzyl alcohol, these al-
cohols can be categorized as cyclic and aromatic alcohols, respectively.
The experimental FP trend line of the binary mixtures comprising of two
alcohols  is  depicted  in  Fig.  A1 (Appendix  A).  Graphs  from  various
studies on different chemical classes are compiled in the Appendix to
simplify  the  main  text,  ensuring  a  smoother  reading  experience.
Experimental data are typically represented using symbols rather than
lines  or  curves.  However,  in  some  cases,  it  may  be  challenging  for
readers to identify and follow the symbols corresponding to each binary
mixture data point due to the large number of symbols in certain figures.
To address this issue, a narrow solid line has been added to connect the
experimental points for each binary mixture, complementing the use of
symbols in all figures provided in the Appendix. This approach aims to
assist  readers  in  more  easily  following  the  trend  line  for  each  binary
mixture.  Furthermore,  there  are  separate  graphs  in  the  Supplemental
Information  for  each  of  the  binary  mixtures  discussed  in  this  review.
Additionally, where available in the original articles, Standard Devia-
tion (SD) and/or Uncertainty (Uc), have been included in the data tables

9

for  each  binary  mixture.  Detailed  information  regarding  these  binary
mixtures, including FP of pure compounds, FP behavior, FP investiga-
tion approach, and measuring method, is presented in Table S2.

The FP behavior of binary blends containing alcohol and alkane was
investigated in some studies, as indicated in Table 2. Among the afore-
mentioned binary mixtures, some are partially miscible, while others are
totally  miscible  mixtures.  The  partially  miscible  mixtures  include
methanol + octane, methanol + nonane, methanol + decane, methanol
+ isooctane, methanol + 1-dodecene, ethanol + tetradecane, ethanol +
hexadecane, and ethanol + dodecane.

In the category of alcohol + alkane mixtures, a significant positive
deviation from ideality that results in MinFPB was frequently observed.
The  mixtures  that  demonstrated  MinFPB  are  as  follows:  methanol  +
heptane, methanol + octane, methanol + nonane, methanol + decane,
methanol + isooctane, ethanol + octane, ethanol + isooctane, 1-prop-
anol + heptane, 1-propanol + octane, 1-propanol + decane, 1-propanol
+ isooctane,  IPA  + octane,  IPA  + isooctane,  1-butanol  + octane,  1-
butanol  + decane,  2-butanol  + octane,  and  2-butanol  + methyl-
cyclohexane. Despite exhibiting a positive deviation from ideality, some
of the binary mixtures did not demonstrate MinFPB. This is primarily
due  to  two  factors:  a  significant  difference  between  the  FPs  of  two
constituents  and/or  insufficient  deviation  from  ideality.  Table  S2 de-
scribes detailed information about the FP of pure components of each
binary  mixture.  Fig.  8 exclusively  presents  mixtures  that  showed
significantly  non-ideal  FP  behaviors  (MinFPB  or  MaxFPB).  However,
regarding space constraints within this manuscript, Table S2, that pro-
vides comprehensive details of all 245 binary mixtures, including mix-
tures with MinFPB, MaxFPB, and no extreme FP behaviors, is presented
in the Supplemental Information.

In certain instances, the measured FP was lower than that of the pure
components at just one composition, and this reduction wasn’t notably
significant across the composition range. For instance, in a research by
Liaw et al. (2002) on octane + 1-butanol, the FP of binary blend varied
C) and 1-butanol
between the FPs of two pure chemicals: octane (15
(36.5
C);  except  when  the  mole  fraction  of  octane  was  0.9  [54].  At
this mole fraction, FP was 0.5
C lower than octane. However, this bi-
nary  blend  also  was  studied  by  Pan  (2015),  where  no  MinFPB  was
observed  in  the  measurements.  Therefore,  since  Liaw  et  al.’s  study
observed a  FP  that is  not  much  lower than that of  its  components, it
could  be  possible  that  such  a  mixture  barely  exhibited  the  MinFPB.
Another  mixture  that  demonstrated  an  insignificant  MinFPB  was
1-propanol  + heptane.  In  this  blend,  only  one  composition  showed  a
measured FP lower than that of the pure constituents (approximately
◦
0.2
C), specifically when the mole fraction of 1-propanol was 0.1 [28].

The  binary  mixture  of  2-butanol  + methylcyclohexane  also  showed
insignificant MinFPB. In this blend, when the mole fraction of 2-butanol
C lower than that of both
was 0.05, there was a FP approximately 0.2
constituents.  Moreover,  although  the  binary  mixture  of  methanol  +
decane showed deviation from ideality, it barely demonstrated MinFPB.
The reason behind this could be attributed the wide temperature gap
between  FPs  of  methanol  and  decane  (approximately  41.8
C)  [74].
Owing to the fact that the FP was lower than that of its components only
in specific composition points and the FPs were not significantly lower
than those of both components in the aforementioned binary mixtures,
these  blends  could  be  considered  as  mixtures  which  barely  exhibited
MinFPB. As evident from the individual graphs of the binary mixtures,
the FP trend line for such mixtures remains relatively constant across
various  compositions,  closely  approaching  the  component  with  the
lower FP. Therefore, this criterion was used to distinguish mixtures that
barely  exhibit  MinFPB  from  those  with  significant  MinFPB.  As
mentioned earlier, only mixtures that demonstrated significant MinFPB
are  included  in  Fig.  8;  mixtures  that  barely  exhibit  MinFPB  are  not
presented in this figure.

◦

The FP study of binary mixtures comprising alcohols and aromatic
hydrocarbons constituted one of the distinctively studied categories; in
total,  15  blends  were  reported  under  this  category  (Table  2).  The  13
mixtures  demonstrated  MinFPB  are  as  follows:  methanol  + toluene,
methanol + p-xylene, ethanol + toluene, ethanol + p-xylene, 1-prop-
anol  + toluene, 1-propanol  + ethylbenzene,  IPA + toluene, IPA  + p-
xylene, 1-butanol + ethylbenzene, 1-butanol + p-xylene, 2-butanol +
toluene, 2-pentanol + ethylbenzene, and 1-hexanol + ethylbenzene.

The MinFPB was not observed only in two studied binary mixtures
(1-butanol + toluene and 1-pentanol + toluene). It is noticeable that the
temperature gap between FP of pure components of these two binary
mixtures  was  greater  compared  to  that  of  other  binary  blends  that
showed MinFPB (Fig. A3 and Table S2). The effect of the temperature
gap between FP of pure components on FP behavior of binary mixtures
were  earlier  discussed  in  literature  [7].  The  empirical  FPs  of  binary
blends  composed  of  alcohol  and  aromatic  hydrocarbon  are  shown  in
Fig. A3.

The FP of binary mixtures with an alcohol and an ester was inves-
tigated  in  several  studies,  as  shown  in  Table  2.  Among  the  studied
mixtures in this category, some of them showed MinFPB: methanol +
methyl  acrylate,  ethanol  + ethyl  acetate,  ethanol  + methyl  butyrate,
ethanol + propyl acetate, 1-butanol + propyl butyrate, and 2-pentanol
+ propyl butyrate.

The mixtures of methanol + methyl acetate, 1-pentanol + ethyl ac-
etate, ethanol + ethyl esters (or methyl esters), and isoamyl alcohol +
isoamyl acetate are the sole combinations of alcohols and esters in which
the  MinFPB  was  not  observed.  It  is  notable  that  the  temperature  gap
between FP of pure components in methanol + methyl acetate, 1-pen-
tanol + ethyl acetate, and ethanol + ethyl esters (or methyl esters) is
considerably  larger  than  that  of  other  binary  mixtures.  Regarding

C); however, isoamyl acetate is a branched ester while other esters
(5.5
mentioned above are straight-chain esters (Fig. 4). The experimental FPs
of binary mixtures consisting of alcohol and ester are shown in Fig. A4.
Some studies explored the FP behavior of mixtures involving alcohol
and ketone (Table 2). This category of binary mixtures did not show any
extreme  FP  behaviors.  In  all  blends,  the  FP  of  mixtures  in  whole
composition ranges ranged between the FPs of their pure components.
Fig. A5 depicts FPs of binary blends in the category of alcohol + ketone.
Combinations  of  alcohols  and  organic  acids  have  been  widely
documented in the literature. The combinations of alcohols and organic
acids showed a distinct category, in which 5 out of 16 mixtures showed
either MinFPB or MaxFPB. Among the five mixtures with extreme FP
behaviors, three of them, 1-propanol + formic acid, 1-hexanol + formic
acid, and 1-hexanol + butyric acid, showed MinFPB, while two of them,
1-butanol  + acetic  acid  and  2-pentanol  + acetic  acid,  demonstrated
MaxFPB (Fig. A6). The FP of the remaining mixtures did not exceed the
FPs of their respective pure components (Table S2). The experimental
FPs of all binary blends consisting of alcohol and organic acid are shown
in Fig. A6.

Two binary  mixtures  of ethers  and  alcohols [EGBE  + methanol  &
EGME + ethanol] were reported by Pan et al. (2015). Both of the mix-
ture’s  FPs  varied  between  the  FPs  of  their  pure  components  [28]
(Table S2). Fig. A7 shows the FP trend line for these binary mixtures.

The  FP  of  alcohol  and  amine  compounds  was  reported  in  three
different cases, as introduced in Table 2. In all of these cases, the blends
did  not  demonstrate  either  the  MaxFPB  or  MinFPB  (Table  S2 and
Fig. A7).

In  a  study,  the  FP  behavior  of  seven  sets  of  binary  mixtures
comprising  of  alcohol  and  a  terpene  was  investigated,  as  shown  in
Table 2. The findings revealed that among these blends, only three of
them had extreme FP behavior in terms of the MinFPB (1-butanol + d-
limonene, 1-pentanol + d-limonene, and 1-hexanol + d-limonene). It is
notable that there is a narrow temperature gap between the FPs of pure
constituents of these three blends in comparison to that of other binary
mixtures with no extreme FP behaviors. Furthermore, it is remarkable
that the mixtures with the narrowest temperature gap showed a more
significant MinFPB (Fig. A8 and Table S2). The remaining binary blends
did not show any extreme FP, and their FP in whole composition ranges
fell  within  the  range  of  FPs  of  their  corresponding  components
(Table S2). Fig. A8 displays the FP trend line for the binary mixtures

4.2. Binary mixtures comprise alkanes

In this section, binary mixtures comprising alkanes were discussed.
The binary mixtures containing both alkanes and alcohols were exclu-
sively addressed in the previous section.

FP behavior of mixtures comprising two alkanes has been reported in
some  previous  experimental  studies  (Table  3).  Experimental  FPs  ob-
tained from those studies are shown in Fig. A9.

In  this  category  (alkane  + alkane),  the  extreme  FP  behavior  was

observed only in one case: octane + decane [95].

C) was only 0.5

In one study [95], the binary mixture of octane + decane demon-
strated MinFPB. It was shown that the FP of the mixture was lower than
both pure components, at 0.8 and 0.9 of octane. The minimum measured
FP (12.35
C).
Given that observation of the MinFPB in binary mixtures containing two
linear hydrocarbons is impossible due to the ideal FP behavior of this
mixture  [7],  the  binary  blend  of  octane  + decane  was  also
re-investigated  in  another  research;  however,  the  MinFPB  was  not
observed [7]. Considering that the compositions showed FP lower than

C lower than the FP of octane (12.85

both pure components observed in the Noorollahy et al. (2010) study
was not significant and exclusively observed in two compositions, and
that the study of da Cunha et al. (2017) did not exhibit any extreme FP
behaviors, it is possible that the observed FP in Noorollahy et al. (2010)
could be attributed to experimentally measurement errors (Table S2).
Regarding the binary mixture of octane + decane, the experimental data
presented  in  da  Cunha  et  al.  (2017)  have  been  used  in  Fig.  A9.
Furthermore,  it  is  not  possible  to  observe  any  of  the  extreme  FP  be-
haviors  in  mixtures  composed  of  chemicals  from  the  same  chemical
classes.

FP behavior of mixtures consisting of both alkane and aromatic hy-
drocarbon, which is one of the most frequently studied categories, was
documented in some studies (Table 3 and Fig. A10). Among the studied
binary  mixtures  in  this  category  none  of  the  binary  blends  showed
extreme FP behavior.

Experimental data for binary mixtures containing an alkane and an
ester  have  been  reported  in  previous  studies  (Table  3).  Three  binary
mixtures  of  octane  + methyl  butyrate,  octane  + propyl  acetate,  and
dodecane + ethyl octanoate showed MinFPB. The minFP observed for
octane  + methyl  butyrate,  octane  + propyl  acetate,  and  dodecane  +

4.5. Binary mixtures comprise esters

In this subsection, the discussion concerns to mixtures composed of
two esters and combinations involving one ester and one organic acid
(Table 5). None of the mixtures showed MinFPB or MaxFPB, and the FP
of each mixture fell within the temperature range of its pure components
[67,107,108]  (Table  S2 and  Figs.  A14  and  A15).  The  blends  demon-
strated non-extreme FP behaviors in all composition ranges.

The FP of only one binary mixture with an organic acid and an ester
was reported in the literature, namely, propyl butyrate + acetic acid [3].
The  mixture’s  FP  did  not  exceed  that  of  its  pure  constituents  (propyl

4.3. Binary mixtures comprise cycloalkenes

4.6. Binary mixtures comprise ketones

In a study [37], the FP behavior of three binary blends comprising
cycloalkanes and other chemical groups were investigated (Table 3). In
this  review,  two  chemical  categories  of  binary  mixtures  containing
cycloalkane are presented: cycloalkene + cycloalkane and cycloalkene
+ aromatic hydrocarbon. The FP of pure chemicals was 46.9, (cid:0) 3, 4, and
◦
30
C for dicyclopentadiene, methylcyclohexane, toluene, and p-xylene,
respectively;  none  of  the  mixtures  showed  either  MinFPB  or  MaxFPB
(Fig. A12 and Table S2).

4.4. Binary mixtures comprise aromatic hydrocarbons

The aromatic hydrocarbons discussed in this review are presented in
Table 4. In the following sections, the category of mixtures containing
aromatic hydrocarbons will be discussed in detail.

The FP behavior of a binary mixture consisting of two aromatic hy-
drocarbons  was  investigated  in  a  research  [7].  The  binary  mixture,
p-xylene + m-xylene, demonstrated an ideal FP behavior in the whole
composition range (Fig. A13).

The FP behavior of aromatic hydrocarbon + ketone was investigated
in  one  case,  specifically,  toluene  + 2-butanone  (Fig.  A13).  In  this
mixture, non-ideal FP behavior was observed; however, the non-ideality
was not significant enough to result an extreme FP behavior [28].

The FP of an aromatic hydrocarbon + an organic acid was examined
in a few studies (Table 4). The FP behavior of three of blends showed the
MinFPB: ethylbenzene + acetic acid, ethylbenzene + propionic acid, and
o-xylene + propionic acid (Fig. 8 and A13).

The FP behavior of an aromatic hydrocarbon + an amine (chloro-
benzene + aniline) was reported by Hristova et al. (2012). The blend did
not show any of the extreme FP behaviors [106] (Fig. A13 and Table S2).
FP study of a binary mixture comprising two chemical groups, aro-
matic hydrocarbons and ethers, was conducted on the ignitable binary
eutectic mixture of diphenyl ether and biphenyl. This mixture is widely
used in various applications, such as a heat transfer fluid in solar power
systems.  Notably,  this  binary  mixture  exhibited  nearly  ideal  FP
behavior.

The  FP  behavior  of  ketone  with  various  chemical  classes  was  re-
ported in other researches, as introduced in Table 6. The type of mix-
tures showed ideal and nearly ideal FP behaviors without any extremum
FPs in their composition range (Fig. A16 and Table S2).

4.7. Binary mixtures comprise organic acids

The  binary  mixture  of  formic  acid  + acetic  acid  containing  two
organic acids was studied by Ha and Lee (2013a). The blend showed an
ideal FP behavior in whole compositions, and the FP of pure chemicals
was  72  and  54
C  for  formic acid  and  acetic acid,  respectively  [109]
(Fig. A16 and Table S2).

◦

4.8. Binary mixtures comprise monoterpenoids

In a study by Vilas-Baos et al. (2023), the FP behavior of five binary
mixtures comprising monoterpenoids were investigated, as illustrated in
Table  6 [63].  As  the  binary  mixtures  consisted  of  two  ignitable  com-
pounds from the same chemical classes, extreme FP behavior was not
observed, with FPs across all compositions ranging between the FPs of
the individual pure compounds (Fig. A17).

4.9. Binary mixtures comprise phenol

hydrocarbons or alcohols.

It is important to note that phenol is a unique organic compound. Its
structure features a benzene ring along with a –OH group (Fig. 4). This
hydroxyl group is distinct from the hydroxyl bonds in the alcohols and
organic acids because in phenol the –OH group is directly attached to an
aromatic carbon rather than a branched or chained carbon. Therefore,
phenol  was  not  classified  as  either  an  alcohol  or  an  aromatic  hydro-
carbon  compound;  instead,  it  is  categorized  separately.  In  the  subse-
quent paragraphs, it will be observed that this unique chemical structure
can  lead  to  different  FP  behaviors  when  compared  to  aromatic

Four binary mixtures containing both phenol and alcohol were re-
ported in the FP studies (Table 7). Among the four binary blends three of
them (cyclohexanol + phenol, benzyl alcohol + phenol, and 1-octanol +
phenol) showed MaxFPB. The MaxFP for cyclohexanol + phenol, benzyl
alcohol + phenol, and 1-octanol + phenol were 82.8, 98, and 88.1
C
while the FPs of pure cyclohexanol, phenol, benzyl alcohol, and 1-octa-
◦
nol were 68.5, 81, 97.2, and 86.8

C, respectively.

◦

The  extreme  FP  behavior  was  not  observed  only  in  one  binary

mixture of this category; 1-propanol + phenol (Fig. A18).

Two  binary  mixtures  containing  both  phenol  and  ketone  were

14

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 108 (2025) 101222

reported, as presented in Table 7. The results showed that the two blends
exhibited MaxFPB. The MaxFP for phenol + acetophenone and cyclo-
hexanone + phenol were 89 and 82.5
C, respectively. The FP of pure
components  were 81,  83.5,  and 46
C for  phenol,  acetophenone, and
cyclohexanone, correspondingly (Fig. A18).

◦

◦

The binary mixture of phenol + 4-picoline (phenol + a pyridine) was
another blend in which phenol was one of the components. The mixture
demonstrated MaxFPB [11], with a MaxFP of 90.6
C. This value was
C; 4-picoline:
considerably higher than both components (phenol: 81
42.5

C; Table S2 and Fig. A18).

◦

◦

◦

The only binary mixture containing an ester and phenol was isoamyl
butyrate + phenol [13]. This mixture demonstrated a highly negative
deviation  from  ideality,  but  it  was  not  sufficient  to  lead  a  MaxFPB.
Therefore, the FP of mixture in whole composition range was between
the  FPs  of  both  pure  components  (isoamyl  butyrate: 64.1
C;  phenol:
79.6

C).

◦

◦

Generally, the only extreme FP behavior that was observed in the
mixtures containing phenol exclusively was MaxFPB with no example of
MinFPB in the aforementioned categories.

5. Frequency analysis of the extreme FP behaviors

Fig. 9 presents an overview of the frequency of extreme FP behaviors
among various studied organic mixtures. In this regard, performing a
statistical  assessment  of  the  prevalence  of  extreme  FP  behaviors  can
benefit as an indicator for identifying mixtures with a higher tendency or
potential for the MinFPB or MaxFPB. In this statistical approach, mix-
tures  that  showed  extreme  FP  behaviors  are  included,  while  those
recognized as barely MinFPB or barely MaxFPB mixtures are excluded.
As shown in Fig. 9, the occurrence of extreme FP behavior was not seen
in  binary  blends  from  the  same  classes.  However,  among  the  binary
mixtures comprising two constituents originating from distinct chemical
classes, the development of extreme FP behaviors is quite common. For
example,  when  binary  mixtures  comprising  alcohol  and  alkane  were
investigated,  which  is  one  of  the  frequently  studied  types  of  binary
mixtures, the MinFPB was observed in 50.0 % of the cases. In a similar
vein, 30.0 % of the examined binary blends containing alcohol and ester
showed the MinFPB. The combination of alcohol and aromatic hydro-
carbons  demonstrated  the  MinFPB  in  80.0  %  of  the  studies.  It  is
important to note that many of the studied mixtures are intentionally
selected  for  specific  purposes,  and  the  frequency  analysis  results  per-
formed  only  to  the  reported  mixtures.  The  frequency  analysis  for
different categories is shown in Fig. 9.

Particular categories of mixtures were the combinations of phenol +
alcohol,  phenol  + ketone,  and  phenol  + pyridine  that  exclusively
demonstrated the MaxFPB. The distinctive FP behavior observed in the
mixtures containing phenol can be ascribed to the unique structure of
this organic compound that was the reason behind showing phenol in a
distinct category in Fig. 4. Fig. 10 presents the number of studied binary

6. Factors influencing FP behavior of binary mixtures

The extreme FP behaviors, MinFPB and MaxFPB, may occur under
certain conditions. No comprehensive study explicitly addresses all the
factors influencing the emergence of synergistic or antagonistic effects
in binary mixture’s FP. Nevertheless, an analysis of the studied binary
mixtures in the current review revealed some key factors that play key
roles in these extreme FP behaviors.

non-ideal behaviors in binary blends [9]. These forces typically occur
between different organic groupings. For example, it is more likely to
observe MinFPB in binary mixtures comprising both alcohol and alkane.
Conversely,  when  binary  mixtures  involve  two  compounds  from  the
same chemical class, such as ester + ester, the extreme FP behaviors are
unlikely to be observed. It implies that one of the contributing factors is
the chemical class.

6.2. FP gap

It  is  essential  to  note  that  the  distinction  between  organic  classes
alone may not necessarily trigger extreme FP behaviors. For instance, in
binary blends comprising alcohols and alkanes; if the gap in FPs between
the pure components of such a mixture becomes substantial, it is plau-
sible that MinFPB may never occur, as it was observed in 1-pentanol +

This observation aligns with the condition proposed for extreme FP

ical representation of this condition in a binary mixture can be formu-
lated as follows [13]:

To  illustrate,  it  is  crucial  to  emphasize  the  substantial  impact  of
repulsive and attractive forces in changing the vapor pressure of mix-

two constituents.

The influence of the FP gap between the two components of binary
mixtures  became  evident  when  investigating  blends  of  short-  and
medium-chain alcohols (1-propanol, 1-butanol, 1-pentanol, 1-hexanol,
1-octanol, 1-decanol, and 1-dodecanol) with d-limonene, a terpene. In
these binary mixtures, one side consisted of chained alcohol, while the
other side contained d-limonene. It is worth noting that these mixtures
were studied under identical experimental conditions within the same
research study [90]. Among seven studied binary mixtures, MinFPB was
only observed in three of them: 1-butanol + d-limonene, 1-pentanol +
d-limonene,  and  1-hexanol  + d-limonene.  The  temperature  gaps  be-
tween  the  FP  of  the  two  components  in  1-butanol  + d-limonene,
1-pentanol + d-limonene, and 1-hexanol + d-limonene were 13.7, 1, and
11
C,  respectively.  However,  for  the  remaining  binary  blends,  this
temperature  gap  was  greater  (Table  8 and  S2).  It  is  notable  that  the
binary  blend  of  1-pentanol  + d-limonene  demonstrated  the  most
prominent  MinFPB,  having  the  smallest  temperature  gap  when
compared  to  1-butanol  + d-limonene  and  1-hexanol  + d-limonene
(Fig.  A8).  Other  binary  mixtures  in  that  study  did  not  show  enough
deviation from ideality to lead to the development of MinFPB.

◦

Another example supporting this theorem is that the MaxFPB was not
observed in only one of the binary blends in the category of phenol +
alcohol. The binary mixture of 1-propanol + phenol had the widest FP
C), while the FP gaps for other binary mixtures were nar-
gap (56.7
C). As a result, it is possible to consider the tem-
rower (less than 18
perature difference (gap) between the FP values of the pure components
in each binary blend as another factor affecting extreme FP behaviors.

6.3. Non-ideality (extreme activity coefficients)

Another  approach  that  can  be  employed  to  assess  the  potential
emergence  of  extreme  FP  behaviors  is  to  examine  liquid  activity  co-
efficients,  γ,  in  binary  mixtures.  The  activity  coefficient  serves  as  an
indicator of a blend’s ideal or non-ideal behavior. When the combined
values of activity coefficients and FP gap of both constituents in a binary
mixture  are  lower  than  unity,  it  is  sufficient  for  a  mixture  to  exhibit
MaxFPB,  Eqs.  (6)  and  (7) [13].  The  mathematical  description  of  the
relationship can be formulated as follows [7,11,13]:

Eqs.  (14)  and  (15) describe  that  when,  in  a  binary  mixture,  the
combined values of the FP gap and activity coefficients are greater than
unity for one compound (compound with lower FP value) and less than
unity for the other (compound with higher FP value), the FP across the
entire composition range will lie between the FPs of the two constitu-
ents. Table 9 shows an example of a binary mixture, acetone + meth-
anol,  which  exhibits  neither  MinFPB  nor  MaxFPB,  along  with  the
calculated values.

In Eqs. (6), (7), (10), (11), (14) and (15) the component with the

lower FP value is denoted as component 1 [14,56].

(6)

(7)

(8)

(9)

Eqs. (4) and (8) are parts of Eq. (6), similarly, Eqs. (5) and (9) are
parts  of  Eq.  (7).  The  descriptions  suggest  that  mixtures  displaying  a
greater  negative  deviation  from  ideality  are  more  prone  to  exhibit
MaxFPB. Table 9 details two instances of mixtures exhibiting MaxFPB, 4-
picoline  + phenol  and  cyclohexanol  + phenol,  demonstrating  how
variations  in  the  magnitude  of  calculated  values  by  Eqs.  (6)  and  (7)
influence the emergence of extreme FP behavior.

Regarding MinFPB, if Eqs. (10) and (11) satisfied, which account for
the combination of temperature gap and non-ideality, a liquid binary
mixture will exhibit MinFPB [7,10,110]:

Eqs. (4), (5), (12) and (13) are parts of Eqs. (10) and (11).
In order to clarify the effect of activity coefficient and FP gap values
on MinFPB, Table 9 describes two examples, ethanol + octane and oc-
tane + 2-butanol.

Generally, the partially miscible mixtures exhibit more non-ideality
compared to the totally miscible mixtures [74]. To compare the signif-
icance of miscibility on extreme FP behaviors, one might examine two
binary  mixtures:  1-butanol  + octane  (a  totally  miscible  mixture)  and
methanol + nonane (a partially miscible mixture). These two mixtures
◦
have nearly identical FP gap: 21.5
C
for  methanol  + nonane.  However,  the  first  mixture  barely  showed
MinFPB, whereas the second one clearly exhibited MinFPB. It is note-
worthy that both binary mixtures fall under the category of alcohol +
alkane; however, the activity coefficient, which reflects non-ideality, is
higher for methanol + nonane than for 1-butanol + octane (Table 9).

◦
C for 1-butanol + octane and 21.9

In  partially  miscible  mixtures,  due  to  their  higher  non-ideality
compared  to  totally  miscible  mixtures,  it  is  more  likely  to  observe  a
MinFPB. Even in situations with a significant FP gap, a barely showed
MinFPB might be observed. The binary mixture of methanol + decane
serves as an example of a partially miscible mixture with a wide FP gap
that barely showed MinFPB (Table 9).

From a mathematical perspective, it is important to note that if the
equal sign in Eq. (6) or (11) is satisfied, the mixture will barely exhibit
MaxFPB or MinFPB, respectively.

For a binary mixture that exhibits neither MinFPB nor MaxFPB, the

following conditions will be satisfied [10,11]:

6.4. Molecular structure

It is important to note that the existence of two components from
distinct chemical classes in a binary blend, along with a narrow FP gap,
does not necessarily lead to the development of extreme FP behaviors.
For instance, for the investigated binary mixtures of alcohol + ketone
category, there is no reported extreme FP behavior while they originated
from two separate chemical classes and a minimal FP difference between
their pure components has been reported. There are concealed and un-
charted factors that additionally influence these behaviors.

For instance, the binary mixture of isoamyl alcohol + isoamyl acetate
(combination of an alcohol and an ester) shows a blend in which the FP
values of the pure components is very close. Furthermore, the category
of  alcohol  + ester  mixtures  exhibited  a  tendency  for  the  MinFPB.
However,  isoamyl  alcohol  + isoamyl  acetate  mixture  did  not  clearly
exhibit the MinFPB; rather, it barely showed MinFPB. Further data is
needed to establish a well-founded and robust conclusion regarding how
the  molecular  structure  can  influence  the  FP  behavior  of  ignitable
mixtures.

7. Safety and fuel design implications

FP  values  of  ignitable  liquids  have  particular  importance  for  pri-
marily  two  key  objectives:  process  safety  and  fuel  design  [14,111].
Understanding the extreme FP behaviors of mixtures is essential since, in
some  specific  compositions,  these  types  of  mixtures  demonstrate  FPs
higher and lower than both pure constituents in cases of MaxFPB and
MinFPB, respectively. From the safety point of view, ignitable mixtures
with MinFPB can potentially lead to unforeseen situations, as this type of
blend can ignite at lower temperatures. This could pose risks to both the
chemical  processes  and  personnel.  On  the  other  hand,  the  MaxFPB
mixtures demonstrate FPs higher than those of their components, which
can assist in mitigating the F&E risks.

FP plays a critical role in fuel design, particularly in the development
of  biofuels.  Numerous  studies  have  investigated  the  FP  behavior  of
mixtures containing methyl esters and ethyl esters with alcohols or al-
kanes  [2,3,7,10,28,30,36,54,62,80,84],  aiming  to  create  efficient  and
environmentally  friendly  fuels  for  the  future.  Some  of  these  mixtures
exhibited a MinFPB, where the FP of certain binary mixtures was found
to be lower than that of either pure constituent. In another study focused
on fuel screening for internal combustion engines, the importance of FP
was highlighted  as one of the key properties  in developing new fuels
[112]. Additionally, in efforts to develop thermally stable jet fuels and
enhance their combustion performance, various compositions of n-par-
affins, iso-paraffins, cycloparaffins, and aromatics were examined, with
particular attention given to the FP behavior of the formulated mixtures
to optimize their performance [113]. Therefore, regarding fuel design
approaches,  FP  behavior,  particularly  both  the  MinFPB  and  MaxFPB,
may be important as they contribute to the development of suitable fuels
tailored to specific purposes.

As indicated in the preceding sections, Figs. 9 and 10, it is obvious
that the frequency of MinFPB is more than MaxFPB among the reported
binary mixtures. This is due to the prevalence of blends with positive
deviations from ideality outnumbering those with negative deviations
[14].  It is worth noting that the  magnitude of  the minFP in mixtures

C), 1-propanol (21

exhibit  MinFPB  depends  on  the  factors  discussed  in  Section  6.  For
instance, some mixtures frequently used as solvents in the industry, such
as methanol + toluene and 1-propanol + formic acid, exhibit minFPs
that are significantly lower than those of their pure components. Giving
special consideration to these and similar mixtures can enhance safety
during their use and application. The minFPs for methanol + toluene
and  1-propanol  + formic  acid  were  measured  as  (cid:0) 0.5
C,
respectively,  compared  to  the  FPs  of  pure  methanol  (10
C),  toluene
(7.2

C), and formic acid (70
To  evaluate  the  possibility  of  observing  MinFPB  in  each  binary
mixture category, a five-level classification system based on MinFPB was
developed;  (1)  high-frequency:  ≥75  %,  (2)  medium-high-frequency:
<75  %  and  ≥50  %,  (3)  medium-low-frequency:  <50  %  and  ≥25  %,
(4) low-frequency: <25 %, (5) non-frequency: 0 %. Certain categories of
binary  mixtures  can  be  classified  as  high-frequency  (proportional  to
high-risk) combinations due to the occurrence of MinFPB. This involves
category  of  alcohol  + aromatic  hydrocarbon  (80.0  %).  The  medium-
high-frequency  class  includes  mixtures  such  as  aromatic  hydrocarbon
+ organic acid (50.0 %), alcohol + alkane (50.0 %), and alkane + ketone
(50.0 %). Some categories of the binary mixtures can be classified as
medium-low-frequency mixtures, such as alcohol + terpene (42.85 %)
and  alcohol  + ester  (30.0  %).  The  categories  that  seldom  showed
MinFPB were classified as low-frequency category: alkane + ester (16.80
%)  and  alcohol  + organic  acid  (12.5  %).  Furthermore,  in  some  cate-
gories,  none  of  the  studied  binary  mixtures  exhibit  MinFPB  such  as
alcohol + alcohol, alcohol + ketone, alcohol + ether, alcohol + amine,
alkane + alkane, alkane + aromatic hydrocarbon, aromatic hydrocar-
bon + aromatic hydrocarbon, aromatic hydrocarbon + ketone, aromatic
hydrocarbon  + amine,  cycloalkene  + aromatic  hydrocarbon,  cyclo-
alkene  + cycloalkane,  aromatic  hydrocarbon  + ether,  ester  + ester,
ester + organic acid, ketone + organic acid, ketone + ether, ketone +
aldehyde,  organic  acid  + organic  acid,  terpene  + terpene,  phenol  +

alcohol, phenol + ketone, phenol + pyridine, and phenol + ester. These
mixtures  could  be  categorized  as  non-frequency  mixtures  from  the
MinFPB perspective (Fig. 11).

It  is  important  to  highlight  that  the  percentages  presented  in  this
section are based on the number of available binary mixtures, and they
do not represent constitute absolute values. Rather, these values stem
from theoretical judgments and should be considered as indicators of the
significance of each category; these conclusions should not be consid-
ered universally applicable to all possible cases.

Regarding MaxFPB, this FP behavior only was observed in four cat-
egories of binary mixtures: alcohol + organic acid, phenol + alcohol,
phenol + ketone, and phenol + pyridine. Phenol + ketone, phenol +
pyridine, and phenol + alcohol are categories that exclusively showed
MaxFPB, with no instances of MinFPB. However, both extreme FP be-
haviors were observed in mixtures containing alcohol and organic acid.
Among  phenol  + alcohol  mixtures,  three  binary  mixtures  showed
MaxFPB: phenol + cyclohexanol, phenol + benzyl alcohol, and phenol +
1-octanol. In both categories of phenol + ketone and phenol + pyridine,
all binary mixtures showed MaxFPB that illustrated the significance of
phenol in the occurrence of MaxFPB. In all blends that phenol presents,
an  extreme  negative  deviation  from  ideality  was  observed;  however,
only in two binary mixtures of 1-propanol + phenol and isoamyl buty-
rate + phenol, the MaxFPB was not observed that this can be because of
the wide FP gap between FP of pure constituents in these two blends.

In  binary  mixtures  comprising  alcohol  and  organic  acid,  both
MinFPB and MaxFPB were reported. However, MaxFPB was exclusively
observed  when  acetic  acid  was  present  in  the  binary  mixtures,  while
presence  of  other  organic  acids  in  a  binary  mixture  did  not  lead  to
MaxFPB.

In  summary,  it  can  be  deduced  that  the  categories  of  phenol  +
alcohol, phenol + ketone, phenol + pyridine, and alcohol + acetic acid
have the potential to demonstrate MaxFPB. Due to the fact that elevating

the FP of a mixture could lead to a mixture igniting at a higher tem-
perature; the utilization of these categories of mixtures has the potential
to enhance safety levels and lower the F&E risks of mixtures and pro-
cesses  involving  chemical  mixtures,  where  applicable.  Moreover,  the
implementation of agents that trigger the MaxFPB into mixtures origi-
nally showing the MinFPB can assist in mitigating the F&E risks asso-
ciated with their storage and transportation [3,13].

8. Conclusions

This review examined 245 reported binary ignitable mixtures, con-
sisting of 102 pure ignitable compounds, sourced from 69 independent
published articles. The mixtures were categorized based on the chemical
class of their components, and then their behavior in each category was
examined.  The  findings  revealed  that  observation  of  extreme  FP  be-
haviors  (MinFPB  or  MaxFPB)  is  common,  and  certain  categories  of
mixtures  are  more  prone  to  show  such extreme  FP  behaviors.  Hence,
understanding  FP  behavior  of  various  ignitable  categories  appears
essential,  in  contrast  to  Martel  and  Cassidy’s  (2004)  assertion  that
estimation methods for the FP of mixtures are unnecessary in most of
cases, as the FPs of the pure components suffice [114].

8.1. Implications for process safety and combustion science

Regarding  MinFPB,  some  categories  of  binary  blends  showed  a
higher  propensity  (as detailed  in Section  7). However,  it  is  crucial to
note that the reported frequency percentages presented above signifi-
cantly depend on the number of reported blends within each category
and should not be considered as universal criteria. In terms of MaxFPB,
only four categories showed susceptibility for this extreme FP behavior,
including phenol + pyridine, phenol + alcohol, phenol + ketone, and
alcohol + organic acid. Notably, within the reported binary mixtures in
the alcohol + organic acid category, MaxFPB was detected only when
acetic acid present in the mixtures, whereas other organic acids did not
result in MaxFPB when combined with alcohols.

The  review  attempted  to  introduce  an  easy-to-use  approach  for
issuing initial alerts concerning the potential occurrence of extreme FP
behaviors. Four key factors were denoted as the type of chemical class,
molecular  structure,  non-ideality  (activity  coefficient),  and  the  tem-
perature gap between the FP values of pure compounds in binary blends.
The activity coefficient and FP gap are crucial and separate elements,
while chemical class and molecular structure directly influence the ac-
tivity  coefficient.  The  rationale  for  discussing  chemical  classes  and
molecular  structures  is  because  they  are  more  accessible  for  typical
engineers  who  lack  access  to  or  cannot  compute  activity  coefficient
values.  This  strategy  simplifies  the  use  of  the  review’s  findings  and
broadens accessibility to this data for a wider audience.

Mixtures with a higher probability of showing MinFPB are of para-
mount  concern  in  terms  of  safety.  Processes  or  operations  involving
these categories of mixtures must ensure that the applied compositions
of the mixtures are conducive to safe conditions.

FP,  a  critical  factor  influencing  fuel  combustion,  is  essential  for
designing new fuels like biofuels and jet fuels. Research on mixtures of
esters, alcohols, alkanes, and paraffins highlights its role in enhancing
combustion efficiency, stability, and safety [30,62,112,113].

8.2. Future directions and research challenges

Despite  the  numerous  FP  studies  conducted  on  binary  ignitable
mixtures,  certain  combinations  of  binary  mixtures  have  not  been
adequately  studied.  For  instance,  in  the  category  of  alkane  + ketone

19

mixtures, only two binary mixtures (heptane + acetone and decane +
acetone) have been documented, intriguingly, heptane + acetone blend
showed MinFPB and  combination of decane + acetone barely exhibit
MinFPB.  Regarding  other  categories  such  as  aromatic  hydrocarbon  +
organic acid, also only a limited number of studies have been performed,
despite the frequent observation of MinFPB in this category. Therefore,
further  investigations  are  required  to  better  comprehend  the  FP
behavior of those mixtures that fall into these categories. More data can
further validate the theories presented in this study, along with Eqs. (6),
(7), (10), (11), (14) and (15). This approach can ensure the safety of
ignitable chemical mixtures in practical applications.

Regarding  fuel  design,  the  categories  discussed  in  this  review  can
provide insights into which chemical class combinations and conditions
are more likely to result in MinFPB or MaxFPB. This can streamline the
process  of  identifying  an  appropriate  blend  for  a  desired  application.
Moreover, esters play a crucial role in biofuel formulation, as numerous
studies  have  indicated  their  utilization  in  conjunction  with  various
chemical classes like alcohols, alkanes, and ketones to enhance biofuel
efficiency [3,115–118]. Additionally, the use of acetic acid and alcohols
in the manufacture of biofuels has been documented [3,119,120].

Four key factors identified as potential influences on the manifesta-
tion of extreme FP behaviors were found to be the type of chemical class,
molecular  structure,  activity  coefficient,  and  the  temperature  gap  be-
tween the FPs of pure constituents in binary mixtures [10,11,13,110]. It
is  likely  that  further  factors  may  also  contribute  to  the  emergence  of
MinFPB  or  MaxFPB.  The  limited  data  for  underrepresented  chemical
groups emphasizes the need to expand the investigations with the help
of FP experiments, in particular for mixtures that may exhibit MaxFPB.
This will help improve the theoretical understanding as well.

It  is  hoped  that  with  developments  in  FP  testing  procedures  that
hasten the measurement of FPs in ignitable mixtures, we will have access
to  more  information  in  the  future  to  illuminate  all  of  the  important
factors that lead to non-ideality.

One limitation identified is the variability in measurement methods
across studies. However, this discrepancy was found to be minimal, and
any  differences  in  the  measurement  of  pure  constituents  in  binary
mixtures can be resolved through adjustments to the pure substances.

Additionally,  it  is  observed  that  the  extreme  FP  behavior  is
remarkably similar to that of azeotropic behavior [7,56]. This similarity
could also help provide better insight into non-ideality conditions and,
consequently,  extreme  FP  behaviors.  Non-ideal  behavior  stems  from
physical  effects  like  steric  hindrance  and  chemical  effects  such  as
hydrogen  bonding  or  strong  associations,  influenced  by  factors  like
polarity, molecular size, mole fraction, and chemical nature [8]. These
effects manifest in VLE as deviations in activity or fugacity coefficients
from unity, signaling non-ideal mixtures [9].

Furthermore, the exploration of the FP behavior of ternary mixtures
also  could  provide  valuable  insights  to  the  FP  behavior  of  ignitable
mixtures. While this review primarily focused on binary mixtures, multi-
component mixtures are more commonly encountered in practice. For
instance, ternary mixtures such as methyl butyrate + ethanol + octane
and propyl acetate + ethanol + octane have been reported to exhibit
ternary minFPs lower than those of their binary counterparts [84]. This
highlights  the  need  for  further  research  on  the  FP  behavior  of
multi-component  mixtures,  particularly  concerning  extreme  FP
behaviors.

Horng-Jang  LIAW  has  a  BSc  in  chemical  engineering
(1985,  National  Tsing  Hua  University,  Taiwan),  MSc  in
chemical  engineering  (1987,  National  Taiwan  University,
Taiwan) and  a PhD in chemical engineering (1992, National
Taiwan  University,  Taiwan)  and  is  a  Research  at  Industrial
Technology Research Institute (1994–1999), an Assistant Pro-
fessor/Associate  Professor/  Professor  at  China  Medical  Uni-
versity  (1999–2013)  and  a  Professor  at  National  Kaohsiung

He conducts research in chemical process safety, with an
emphasis on fire and explosion hazards: flash point prediction,
flash point behavior, flammability limits estimation and reac-
tivity hazards. The flash point prediction models by Liaw et al. are considered the most
reliable  and  are  popular  for flash  point  prediction  (Phoon  et  al.,  2014;  do  Nascimento
et  al.,  2024)  because  they  are  the  only  models  that  can  accurately  predict  whether  a
mixture  can  exhibit  maximum  or  minimum  flash  point  behavior  (Liu  and  Liu,  2010).
Applications include chemical process safety, fire safety, combustion and fuels.

He has published over 60 peer reviewed SCI articles. He has been the World’s Top 2 %
Scientists in 2022, 2020, 2019. A commercial software for predicting the flash point of
mixtures  (FLAMMA:  FLAsh  Point  Multicomponent  Methods  and  Algorithms®)  was
developed based on Liaw’s model (Barbosa Neto AM, Costa MC, Costa do Nascimento D.
