Hydrogen is a promising future energy carrier due to its potential for production from renewable resources. It can
be used in existing compression ignition diesel engines in a dual-fuel mode with little modification. Hydrogen’s
unique physiochemical properties, such as higher calorific value, flame speed, and diffusivity in air, can effec-
tively improve the performance and combustion characteristics of diesel engines. As a carbon-free fuel, hydrogen
can also mitigate harmful emissions from diesel engines, including carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons,
particulate matter, soot, and smoke. However, hydrogen-fueled diesel engines suffer from knocking combustion
and higher nitrogen oxide emissions. This paper comprehensively reviews the effects of hydrogen or hydrogen-
containing gaseous fuels (i.e., syngas and hydroxy gas) on the behavior of dual-fuel diesel engines. The oppor-
tunities  and  limitations  of  using  hydrogen  in  diesel  engines  are  discussed  thoroughly.  It  is  not  possible  for
hydrogen  to  improve  all  the  performance  indicators  and  exhaust  emissions  of  diesel  engines  simultaneously.
However, reformulating pilot fuel by additives, blending hydrogen with other gaseous fuels, adjusting engine
parameters,  optimizing  operating  conditions,  modifying  engine  structure,  using  hydroxy  gas,  and  employing
exhaust  gas  catalysts  could  pave  the  way  for  realizing  safe,  efficient,  and  economical  hydrogen-fueled  diesel
engines.  Future  work  should  focus  on  preventing  knocking  combustion  and  nitrogen  oxide  emissions  in
hydrogen-fueled diesel engines by adjusting the hydrogen inclusion rate in real time.

agricultural, and service sectors is expected to rise substantially [9]. As
shown in Fig. 2, the global market for diesel-powered engines will grow
from 8.1 USD billion in 2018 to 11.02 USD billion in 2026.

Despite the advantages mentioned above, diesel engines suffer from
some  drawbacks,  such  as  high  emissions  of  nitrogen  oxides  (NOx),
particulate  matter  (PM),  and  smoke  [10–13].  Numerous  researchers
have been investigating and utilizing alternative fuels for diesel engines
as  a  sustainable  solution  to  address  energy  security  challenges  and
environmental issues [5,14]. In this context, much attention has been
paid to different gaseous fuels to provide relatively clean and efficient
burning fuels [15].

Various  gaseous  fuels  have  been  regarded  as  substitutes  for
petroleum-based fuels, including liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), natural
gas (NG), liquefied natural gas (LNG), compressed natural gas (CNG),
biogas,  and  syngas  [16–20].  These  fuels  are  suitable  for  higher
compression diesel-fueled engines because of their excellent resistance
against knock compared to conventional liquid fuels [21,22]. Gaseous
fuels  could  improve  fuel  economy  and  mitigate  pollutant  emissions
under  well-elaborated  mixing  and  combustion  conditions.  Therefore,
using  gaseous  fuels  in  diesel  engines  through  dual-fuel  mode  is
economically  wise  and  environmentally  friendly.  Interestingly,  the
widespread  availability  of  gaseous  fuels  has  globally  popularized  in-
ternal  combustion  engines  operating  based  on  the  dual-fuel  concept
[23].

Diesel  and  gaseous  fuels  are  used  in  dual-fuel  diesel  engines,  also
called “gas diesel engines” [21]. Typically, intake air and gaseous fuel
are  first  premixed  in  dual-fuel  diesel  engines.  The  resultant  mixture
(so-called “primary fuel”) is then compressed within the cylinder just
below  the  auto-ignition  temperature  [24].  After  direct  injection,  the
applied gaseous fuel is mixed with air in the intake manifold or within
the combustion chamber [25]. The compressed mixture is then ignited
with the aid of a small amount of diesel fuel injected into the cylinder
(so-called “pilot fuel”) like in single-fuel diesel engines [26]. Diesel fuel
injection is done because the auto-ignition temperature of the pilot fuel
is lower than the air-gas mixture [24].

Despite the numerous merits of gaseous fuels, some challenges might
be  faced  in  using  these  fuels  in  compression  ignition  engines.  For
instance,  CO2  in  biogas  could  prolong  ignition  delay  while  reducing
flame  propagation speed  and  lowering  engine  thermal efficiency [27,
28]. Furthermore, LPG could not be combusted entirely under low and
medium engine load conditions, adversely reducing engine performance
and  increasing UHC  and CO emissions  [29]. Using natural gas  in liq-
uefied  and  compressed  forms  (LNG  and  CNG)  may  lead  to  increased
emissions of carbon monoxide (CO) and unburned hydrocarbons (UHC)
and  may  also  deteriorate  engine  thermal  efficiency  [30,31].  The
slow-burning velocity and poor lean-burn ability of natural gas result in

1. Introduction

The global energy demand is steeply increasing in response to the
growing world population, rising living standards, and ever-increasing
industrialization [1]. According to the projection made by the Interna-
tional Energy Agency (IEA), the global energy demand will double by
2050 [2]. Today, over 80% of the global energy supply is derived from
fossil-based fuels such as petroleum, coal, and natural gas [3]. Besides
the  depletion  of  fossil  fuel  resources,  their  exploitation,  refining,  and
combustion  have  led  to  large  amounts  of  environmental  pollutants.
Therefore, energy-efficient and environment-friendly technologies must
be developed and implemented in various sectors of the economy.

Diesel is the most widely used petroleum fuel, and its consumption
rate  is  rising  continuously  around  the  globe  [4].  The  universality  of
diesel  engines  can  be  attributed  to  their  several  advantages  over
spark-ignition gasoline counterparts, such as higher thermal efficiency,
better  fuel  economy,  higher  durability,  better  reliability,  and  lower
emissions  (carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  and  unburned  hydrocarbon  (UHC))
[5–7]. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
claims that the global diesel and gas-oil demand will increase from 28.6
to 31.6 million barrels/day between 2017 and 2040 (Fig. 1) [8]. With
the  growing  demand  for  these  middle  distillates,  the  number  of
diesel-fueled  light-  and  heavy-duty  vehicles  in  the  manufacturing,

incomplete combustion, high misfiring rate, and large cyclic variation at
lean mixture combustion [32]. In addition, NG could cause locally lean
mixtures in the combustion chamber [33], which could not sufficiently
sustain flame propagation. This issue might lead to some flame extinc-
tion regions [34], increasing CO and UHC emissions.

Further to the gaseous fuels listed above, biodiesel as a green alter-
native liquid fuel to petrodiesel has gained more attention from many
countries during the last two decades to reduce diesel fuel consumption
[35–37]  and  mitigate  pollutant  emissions  [38–40].  Reportedly,  bio-

compression-ignition  diesel  engines  [38,41–43].  This  renewable  fuel,
synthesized  from  animal  fats,  waste  oils, and  edible/non-edible  vege-
table  oils,  has  attracted  significant  attention  because  of  its  physi-
ochemical  resemblance  to  petrodiesel  [12,44,45].  Biodiesel  is  also
aromatic-  and  sulfur-free  [36,46]  while  containing  10–12  wt%  struc-
tural oxygen [47,48]. Therefore, global biodiesel production is expected
to rise by 9%, from about 36 billion liters in 2017 to over 39 billion liters
by 2027.

and  UHC

emissions

Using biodiesel as a surrogate fuel has its own set of advantages and
disadvantages  (Fig.  3).  Biodiesel  suffers  from  operational  problems
caused  by  its  lower  heating  value,  higher  flash  point,  poor  cold  flow
properties, poor oxidative stability, lower volatility, and higher viscosity
[44,49–51]. The latter might deteriorate fuel spraying and atomization,
leading to the formation of a heterogeneous air-fuel mixture. Therefore,
the  reduced  burning  rate  and  prolonged  combustion  duration  reduce
engine  thermal  efficiency  [52].  The  lower  heating  value  of  biodiesel
significantly also deteriorates the fuel economy of diesel engines [53].
Through dual-fuel operation mode, biodiesel problems could be greatly
reduced by improving combustion [54].

This problem occurs since a lean mixture of intake air-main fuel cannot
burn  effectively  [54].  The  broad  flammability  range  and  high  flame
speed of hydrogen make it an effective solution for addressing many of
the challenges associated with gaseous fuels mentioned earlier [54,55].
Clean-burning  gaseous  hydrogen  is  envisaged  as  one  of  the  most
promising  future  energy  carriers  due  to  its  potential  production  from
renewable sources. Hydrogen could improve the thermal efficiency of
dual-fuel diesel engines, considering its higher flame velocity than the
other gaseous fuels [56]. Because of the absence of structural carbon,
hydrogen could also reduce UHC and CO emissions from dual-fuel en-
gines [57,58].

Battery electric and fuel cell vehicles have emerged as potential al-
ternatives  to  internal  combustion  engines.  However,  in  the  short-to-
medium term, these vehicles may not be able to compete with internal
combustion  engines  in  all  applications,  especially  for  heavy-duty
transportation [59,60]. The limited range and payload capacity of bat-
tery  electric  and  fuel  cell  vehicles  make  them  more  suitable  for
lighter-duty  and  shorter-haul  applications  [60].  Furthermore,  battery
electric vehicles will not significantly replace internal combustion en-
gines in commercial transport because of the weight, size, and cost of the
batteries.  Currently,  fuel  cell  vehicles  are  considerably  expensive,
necessitate significant infrastructure development, and are experiencing
slower technological advancements than other alternatives [60]. Man-
ufacturers  or  purchasers  will  not  adopt  fuel  cell  technology  until  the
cost, performance, dependability, durability, and safety of the compo-
nents  of  fuel  cell  vehicles  can  be  accepted  [61].  Overall,  for  battery
electric and fuel cell vehicles to gain traction in the heavy-duty vehicle
market, they must address various barriers, such as cost, infrastructure,
and performance limitations [60].

Dual-fuel  diesel  engines  also  suffer  from  low  efficiency  when  the
proportion of the primary fuel is lower than a lower limit value [54].

Fuel  cell  and  battery  electric  vehicles  will  not  necessarily  lead  to
positive  environmental  impacts.  For  example,  considering  the  energy

used  in  electricity  generation  and  battery  manufacturing,  the  true
benefit of battery electric vehicles is substantially smaller than it appears
at first glance [59]. In many analyses, upstream CO2  from fuel extrac-
tion, refining, transportation, and electricity production and distribution
is  ignored.  Extracting  the  raw  materials  (cobalt,  lithium,  rare  earth
minerals) for battery and electric motor manufacturing requires a lot of
water and energy [59]. In addition, the rapid growth of battery electric
vehicles will increase the demand for materials used in batteries to un-
supportable  levels,  resulting  in  serious  social,  ethical,  economic,  and
environmental  issues  [62].  Life  cycle  analyses  must  also  account  for

end-of-life disposal of the components of battery electric vehicles [59].
The construction of new electricity infrastructure and additional clean
electricity  generation  to  recharge  millions  of  battery  electric  vehicles
will consume more raw materials and produce more CO2 emissions [59].
Rare  materials  can  pose  a  problem  when  building  new  electricity
infrastructure  [59].  Vehicles  powered  by  fuel  cell  technology  face
similar challenges.

By  improving  internal  combustion  engines,  transportation  can
become  more  sustainable  in  terms  of  environmental  impact  (e.g.,
greenhouse  gas  emissions),  economic  viability,  and  energy  security

[59]. Despite introducing new vehicle technologies, efforts are made to
improve the thermal efficiency of internal combustion engines without
significantly  increasing  purchase  and  operating  costs.  With  these  de-
velopments, it is even more difficult for competing technologies to gain
an advantage over internal combustion engines [59]. On the other hand,
competition between fuel cell or battery electric vehicles and internal
combustion  engines  promotes  the  development  of  thermal  engines.
Thus, internal combustion engines will still play a central role, whether
used to generate shaft work or to power the vehicle itself, regardless of
the extent of powertrain electrification [59]. In addition, hydrogen can
play  an  important  role  in  enhancing  the  sustainability,  viability,  and
efficiency  of  internal  combustion  engines.  Using  renewable  energy
sources such as solar and wind energy to produce hydrogen can make
the  improvements  more  pronounced.  As  diesel  engines  are  becoming
more  prevalent  in  heavy-duty  applications,  this  trend  is  expected  to
continue, making it crucial to find ways to reduce the emissions pro-
duced by diesel combustion. Using hydrogen in dual-fuel diesel engines
can serve as a viable solution in the short-to-medium term to address this
issue.

The present paper is intended to provide a comprehensive review of
the  effects  of  incorporating  hydrogen  and  its  admixture  with  biogas,
syngas, NG, CNG, LNG, LPG, hydroxy gas (HHO), and inert gas on the
combustion, performance, and emission characteristics of dual-fuel en-
gines  powered  by  diesel/biodiesel  blends.  First,  hydrogen  production
and  consumption  routes  are  briefly  illustrated.  The  combustion  of
hydrogen in internal combustion engines is then explained mechanisti-
cally. Third, the effects of hydrogen addition on the combustion, per-
formance, and emission parameters of engines fueled by diesel/biodiesel

blends are comprehensively reviewed and critically discussed. Finally,
the  variations  in  unregulated  emissions  from  hydrogen-fueled  diesel
engines are thoroughly summarized and analyzed. Table 1 compares the
present review with those previously published concerning the effects of
hydrogen on the behavior of diesel engines. To the best of our knowl-
edge, the present paper is the first attempt to comprehensively review
the consequences of incorporating hydrogen and its mixture with other
gaseous  fuels,  liquid  fuels,  and  inert  compounds  on  the  behavior  of
diesel engines. The opportunities and limitations of adding hydrogen as
the supplemental fuel in diesel engines are also discussed and speculated
thoroughly.

2. Hydrogen production

The simple and light hydrogen molecule is one of the most abundant
chemical elements in the universe. Interestingly, 90% of the universe
and 60% of the human body are made up of ubiquitous hydrogen mol-
ecules [89]. However, hydrogen is only found in combination with other
elements, particularly with oxygen in the water and carbon, oxygen, and
nitrogen in fossil fuels and living organisms [90]. This essential element
becomes an attractive and clean energy carrier on which it is separated
from  its  parent  substances  [90].  Hydrogen  is  produced  using  various
energy sources, including fossil fuels and renewable sources, as shown in
Fig. 4 [91–93].

Generally,  approximately  96%  of  the  current  global  hydrogen  de-
mand is directly met by fossil fuels, while the remaining 4% is obtained
from  water  electrolysis  (Fig.  5)  [94].  It  should  be  noted  that  water
electrolysis and other electricity-driven hydrogen-production processes

do not directly use fossil fuels as chemical feedstock. However, fossil fuel
combustion accounts for approximately 70% of global electricity gen-
eration. With fossil fuels overwhelmingly used for electricity generation,
it is evident that up to 98% of all industrial hydrogen production relies
on fossil fuels. More specifically, the oxidative transformation of fossil
fuels  (e.g.,  steam  reforming,  partial  oxidation,  gasification,  and  com-
bustion) accounts for most industrial hydrogen production [94].

Renewable  energy  resources  account  for  only  a  small  part  of  the
world’s hydrogen demand. Hydrocarbon reforming and pyrolysis are the
two main pathways to producing hydrogen from fossil fuels [93]. More
specifically, partial oxidation, steam reforming, and autothermal steam
reforming are the most commonly used processes to produce fossil-based
hydrogen [93]. A gas stream composed of hydrogen, carbon monoxide,
and carbon dioxide is produced during these processes. An external heat
source is required in hydrocarbon steam reforming, but oxygen is not
needed in the process [93,95]. In addition, the operating temperature of
the  steam  reforming process  is  lower than both  partial oxidation and
it  produces  a
autothermal  steam  reforming  processes,  while
hydrogen-rich  gas  stream  [96].  Despite  the  desirable  features  of  hy-
drocarbon steam reforming, it suffers from high emissions of pollutants
compared  to  partial  oxidation  and  autothermal  steam  reforming  pro-
cesses [97].

The greenhouse gas emissions associated with hydrogen production
from fossil resources are major concerns worldwide, overshadowing its
economic attractiveness [93]. It is estimated that fossil-based hydrogen
production annually emits about 830 million tons of carbon. Therefore,
developing renewable hydrogen production pathways is imperative to
comply  with  the  ever-increasing  global  demand  for  environmentally

friendly  energy  carriers  [98].  Renewable  hydrogen  can  be  produced
from  biomass  through  thermochemical  and  biological  pathways  or
water  through  thermolysis,  electrolysis,  and  photolysis  routes  [93].
Table 2 tabulates the merits and demerits of various hydrogen produc-
tion routes and their efficiency and production cost [99]. It should be
noted that, besides hydrogen production technology, raw material costs
play  a  crucial  role  in  its  production  cost,  as  shown  in  Fig.  6  [100].
Overall,  biomass  gasification  is  a  promising  route  for  producing
renewable hydrogen.

Compared with widely used fuels, hydrogen is carbon-free and has
the highest calorific value (Table 3) [93]. Fig. 7 also provides an esti-
mate of the energy density of hydrogen for different applications, which
accounts for the mass of the storage tank. The applications listed in the
figure  refer  to  different  modes  of  transportation,  including  transport-
able, truck & transportable, truck & bus, and passenger car. Hydrogen
has the highest energy density in the transportable application (≈11.7
MJ/kg storage tank), followed by truck & transportable (≈10.6 MJ/kg
storage tank), truck & bus (≈9.55 MJ/kg storage tank), and passenger
car (≈6.37 MJ/kg storage tank) applications [101]. However, it should
be noted that hydrogen’s energy density is lower than that of diesel and

gasoline. Despite this, hydrogen is a promising future fuel with many
potential  social,  economic,  and  environmental  advantages.  As  a
low-emissions  fuel,  it  could  play  a  crucial  role  in  reducing  the  trans-
portation  sector’s  dependence  on  fossil  fuels  and  lowering  carbon
emissions in the long term [91]. However, it is important to note that the
transition  to  hydrogen  will  require  significant  investment  in  infra-
structure, including production, storage, and distribution. Accordingly,
it  is  expected  that  annual  global  hydrogen  demand  from  the
power-to-power/transport/gas sectors is expected to attain 3.5 billion
kg by 2030, according to Navigant Research estimation (Fig. 8) [102].
Hydrogen is extensively used in various industries, such as fuel cells,
refinery processes, and rocket propellants [103]. At present, hydrogen is
mainly  used  as  a  chemical  reactant  in  producing  petrochemicals  and
processing petroleum [104]. According to Fig. 9, hydrogen is extensively
employed  in  manufacturing  ammonia,  refining  oil,  and  producing
methanol  [100].  Furthermore,  internal  combustion  engines  could  be
directly  fueled  with  hydrogen  [105,106].  The  following  section
comprehensively explains the use of hydrogen in diesel engine fuel.

3. Hydrogen combustion in internal combustion engines

Hydrogen  is  a  promising  energy  carrier  in  the  long-term  future
because  of  its  clean  combustion  profile  and  potential  for  sustainable
production  [107,108].  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  hydrogen
combustion still generates pollutants like NOx. While hydrogen has a
relatively  high  energy  density  per  unit  of  mass,  its  energy  density  is
lower  than  many  conventional  fuels  when  considering  storage  tank
limitations. This unique energy source is used for power production in

combustion  devices  or  fuel  cell  systems  [109].  Hydrogen  combustion
does not produce hazardous toxic compounds like hydrocarbons, carbon
oxides,  sulfur  oxides,  and  organic  acids  [110,111].  Indeed,  the  main
product of hydrogen combustion is water. Spark ignition engines can be
successfully  powered  by  hydrogen  in  pure  form,  with  improved  ther-
modynamic performance and increased power output [112]. However,
several  major  issues  are  associated  with  using  pure  hydrogen  in
spark-ignition engines, such as high engine knock and NOx emissions
[112–114]. It is also possible to fuel internal combustion engines using
pure hydrogen, so-called hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engines
(H2ICEs)  [115].  These  engines  have  several  limitations,  including
decreased volumetric efficiency, elevated self-ignition temperature, and
prolonged ignition delay. Hydrogen could also be used in diesel engines
in the dual-fuel operation mode, addressing the abovementioned issues
[115]. The gaseous hydrogen cannot be ignited in diesel-fueled engines
without  the  aid  of  any  ignition  sources  because  of  its  higher

[116]. Thus, diesel or its blends are directly introduced to the combus-
tion chamber to initiate hydrogen combustion [117].

Hydrogen is introduced into the combustion chamber of diesel en-
gines  as  a  primary  fuel  by  carburation,  manifold/port  injection,  and
direct  in-cylinder  injection  (Fig.  10)  [115,118–120].  The  carburetion
technique is the simplest and oldest technique of introducing hydrogen
into diesel engines using a gas carburetor [121]. The intake air velocity
is increased after passing through a venturi nozzle, resulting in a pres-
sure  drop  in  the  venturi’s  throat.  The  magnitude  of  pressure  drop
drawing  the  fuel  into  the  air  stream  relies  on  the  airflow  rate.

Fig. 11. A representation of the main problems and recommended solutions to using hydrogen in internal combustion engines.

Accordingly, the power output of the engine is controlled by varying the
quantity  of  the  fuel-air  mixture  drawn  into  the  combustion  chamber
[122].

In the port injection approach, fuel is directly injected into the intake
manifold  after  the  inception  of  the  intake  stroke  using  an  injection
system operated mechanically or electronically [120]. The inlet supply
pressure of the port injection approach lies between those of the car-
buration and direct injection methods. The quantity of fuel is measured
by modifying the hydrogen injection pressure or changing the injection
duration by controlling the signal pulses of the injector [121]. Thus, the
quantity of primary fuel injected into the intake air (i.e., hydrogen) and
the  quantity of pilot  fuel supplied  into  the combustion chamber (i.e.,
diesel) determines how much power the engine produces [122]. Overall,
the port/manifold injection method requires slight engine modification
while providing higher power output than the carburation method [123,
124].

Direct hydrogen injection into the cylinder offers distinct advantages
over  carburation  and  port  injection  methods.  It  enables  precise  fuel
delivery, improves combustion, increases power output, and enhances
fuel economy while reducing emissions. Fuel economy improvements of
up to 15% have been reported in direct injection, which significantly
reduces  fuel  wastage  [125].  This  method  can  also  reduce  cold-start
emissions by up to 25%. The direct injection approach enables engine
performance  optimization  by  precisely  metering  the  fuel  amount  for
each cylinder. Fuel is sprayed at higher pressures, causing it to atomize
well and ignite almost instantaneously [125].

Direct injection permits fuel delivery after the intake valve is closed,
preventing the possibility of backfire since hydrogen and air are rapidly
dispersed  and  mixed.  As  the  intake  valve  is  closed,  the  low-pressure
direct injector injects primary fuel (i.e., hydrogen) when the pressure
inside the cylinder is low. The high-pressure direct injector injects pilot
fuel (i.e., diesel) at the end of the compression stroke [121]. It is worth
mentioning that the term “low-pressure” is used to describe the direct
gas injector that delivers primary fuel (i.e., hydrogen) at a lower pres-
sure compared to the high-pressure injector, which injects the pilot fuel
(i.e., diesel). The low-pressure gas injector typically operates at a pres-
sure  range  of  300–350  bar  [126],  while  the  high-pressure  injector
operates at a much higher pressure range, ranging from 400 to 2200 bar

[127].

Direct  injection  offers  significant  advantages,  even  when  injecting
hydrogen  at  early  crank  angles,  due  to  its  precise  control  of  timing,
duration, and fuel quantity injected into the combustion chamber. This
results in better dispersion and mixing of hydrogen with air, leading to a
more homogeneous air-fuel mixture and complete combustion, as well
as  reducing  the  possibility  of  pre-ignition  and  knocking,  thereby
enhancing  engine  performance  and  efficiency.  However,  while  all
gaseous fuel injectors can control fuel timing, duration, and quantity,
the location of the injector and timing of fuel delivery differ in direct
injection and port injection. In port injection, the injector is situated in
the  intake  port,  injecting  fuel  before  the  intake  valve.  This  approach
leads to fuel mixing with air in the intake port, and the resulting mixture
is drawn into the combustion chamber during the intake stroke. While
port injection can provide acceptable mixture preparation and control, it
is  not  as  effective  as  direct  injection  systems  in  terms  of  precise  fuel
delivery  and combustion control. Direct  injection systems  can deliver
fuel at various times and quantities under different operating conditions,
improving  combustion control  and efficiency. Additionally, the direct
injection of fuel into the combustion chamber enables better dispersion
and mixing with air, leading to further improvements in combustion and
reduced emissions.

The direct injection method effectively addresses pre-ignition issues
in the intake manifold but may not completely prevent pre-ignition in-
side the cylinder [120]. The high injection pressure in direct injection
increases turbulence in the fuel-air stream, resulting in a more homo-
geneous air-fuel mixture than in carburation and port injection methods
[122]. Precise control of fuel injection timing, duration, and quantity
directly into the combustion chamber enables direct injection to provide
a more homogeneous air-fuel mixture than port and manifold injection
methods. This results in better dispersion and mixing of fuel with air,
promoting even distribution and complete combustion. This character-
istic is particularly significant in hydrogen-fueled diesel engines, where
a homogeneous mixture of hydrogen/diesel and air that is well-mixed
and  evenly  distributed  throughout  the  combustion  chamber  is  desir-
able. However, it should be noted that various factors, such as injector
spray characteristics, combustion chamber shape and size, and air mo-
tion  inside  the  cylinder,  can  affect  the  homogeneity  of  the  air-fuel

mixture in direct injection.

The main reasons behind the use of hydrogen in diesel engines are to
increase the H/C ratio of the fuel mix and improve the homogeneity of
the air-fuel mixture. The latter occurs because of the high diffusivity of
hydrogen in fuel spray, making the combustible mixture well-premixed
with  intake  air  and,  consequently,  propelling  the  combustion  process
toward completion. The laminar flame speed of hydrogen can vary be-
tween  1.85  and  2.9  m/s  [81,82,84,128,129],  depending  on  several
factors such as pressure and temperature, turbulence intensity, the shape
and  size  of  the  combustion  chamber,  and  the  equivalence  ratio.
Compared  to  most  hydrocarbon  fuels,  hydrogen  has  a  significantly
higher laminar flame speed, at least five times higher than typical hy-
drocarbon  fuels  such  as  gasoline  or  diesel  (≈0.4  m/s)  [82,130].
Although a higher flame speed can result in faster and more complete
combustion  of  the  fuel,  it  does  not  necessarily  translate  into  higher
thermal efficiency, as it may cause some of the heat produced during the
combustion  process  to  be  lost  before  it  can  be  converted  into  useful
work. Therefore, it should be recognized that a higher flame speed does
not  always  equate  to  higher  thermal  efficiency  in  a  hydrogen-fueled
diesel  engine.  However,  hydrogen-fueled  diesel  engines  emit  more
NOx because of higher in-cylinder temperatures [131–133]. In response
to this challenge, various approaches, such as exhaust gas recirculation
strategy  [134–136],  lean  mixture  use  [131,137],  charge  dilution  by
helium, nitrogen, and water [138,139], lean NOx traps [140,141], hy-
drocarbon  selective  catalytic  reduction  [140,142,143],  and  selective
catalytic reduction [140,144], have been introduced and evaluated. The
main problems with using hydrogen in internal combustion engines and
the solutions to overcome the problems are listed in Fig. 11.

4. Use of hydrogen in diesel engines powered by diesel/
biodiesel blends with/without additives

Hydrogen has been widely used in diesel-ignited engines. Biodiesel
and  its  blends  have  also  been  extensively  used  in  diesel  engines  as  a
hydrogen ignition source. In addition, improving fuel properties through
its reconstitution is one of the most feasible approaches to enhancing the
diesel combustion process. Diesel fuel reformulation needs neither en-
gine  modifications  nor  extra  equipment  [38].  The  reformulation  of
diesel  fuel  is  accomplished  with  various  additives,  from  oxygenated
liquid fuels to nanoscale particles. Fuel additives have been widely used
in  hydrogen-fueled  diesel  engines  because  of  their  positive  effects  on
their operations [145–147]. This section summarizes and discusses the

effects  of  hydrogen  addition  on  the  combustion,  performance,  and
emission characteristics of dual-fuel diesel engines ignited by diesel/-
biodiesel blends with/without additives. Tables S1–S3 tabulate the ef-
fects  of  hydrogen  addition  on  the  combustion  and  performance
characteristics  of  diesel  engines  ignited  by  diesel/biodiesel  blends
with/without additives.

4.1. Performance indicators

-  Brake thermal efficiency and brake specific fuel/energy consumption

The capability of an engine to turn the chemical energy of the sup-
plied fuel into the brake/mechanical power is termed “Brake Thermal
Efficiency  (BTE)”  [148].  According  to  the  results  of  various  research
studies, incorporating hydrogen into neat diesel fuel could increase the
BTE of diesel engines [149–152]. Fig. 12 schematically represents the
progression  of  the  combustion  process  of  the  hydrogen-fueled  diesel
engine  at  the  near  top  dead  center  (TDC).  Adding  hydrogen  to  neat
diesel fuel could lead to a complete combustion process because of its
higher flame temperature and faster flame velocity than straight diesel
fuel [119,132,137,153]. More specifically, hydrogen’s flame velocity is
approximately nine times greater than that of pure diesel fuel. In addi-
tion, hydrogen has the potential to enhance the burning of straight diesel
fuel  due  to  the  broader  flammability  limits  of  its  premixed  flames
compared  to  hydrocarbon  fuels,  improving  the  BTE  of  diesel  engines
[123]. Hydrogen can also shift the upper limit of heat release closer to
the injection (TDC) position, leading to a higher cycle efficiency of diesel
engines [123]. However, it is important to note that using hydrogen in a
diesel  engine  does  not  always  guarantee  improving  BTE.  While
hydrogen has a higher energy content per unit of mass than diesel fuel,
other factors, such as the air/fuel ratio and engine design, can signifi-
cantly influence the BTE of the engine.

One of the factors that can improve the BTE of diesel engines is the
high calorific value of hydrogen. This issue is because the high calorific
value of hydrogen can potentially shift the hydrogen-diesel combustion
process toward completion, leading to improved engine efficiency [119,
153]. However, it is important to note that while fuels with a higher
calorific value can potentially release more energy during combustion,
this does not necessarily mean the combustion will be more complete.
The completeness of the combustion process is also influenced by factors
such  as  the  air/fuel  ratio  and  the  mixing  of  the  fuel  and  air  in  the
combustion  chamber.  Furthermore,  hydrogen  addition  to  diesel  fuel

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience98(2023)10110010

S.H. Hosseini et al.

could well homogenize the air-fuel mixture because of its gaseous nature
[119,155],  leading  to  rapid  energy  release  and  improved  combustion
[156].

Adding hydrogen to diesel fuel can potentially improve the BTE of
diesel engines by several mechanisms. One possible method to achieve
this is by attaining a leaner equivalence ratio and decreasing the com-
bustion duration [157]. However, the effect of hydrogen addition on the
equivalence  ratio  of  the  mixture  can  depend  on  the  specific  engine
operating  conditions  and  the  amount  of  hydrogen  added.  While
hydrogen injection into the intake port may slightly reduce the air flow
rate,  resulting  in  a  leaner  mixture  equivalence  ratio,  the  increase  in
hydrogen concentration can also lead to a richer mixture. However, at
higher  hydrogen inclusion rates, the overall air/fuel ratio can still be
maintained at or near stoichiometric conditions to prevent a decrease in
power output due to the higher hydrogen inclusion rates. Additionally,
the heat capacity ratio (adiabatic index) of hydrogen is higher compared
to  hydrocarbon  fuels,  which  can  contribute  to  the  improved  BTE  of
diesel engines. Moreover, the rapid burn rate of hydrogen can lead to a
lower heat loss rate to the ambient, further boosting the BTE of diesel
engines  [158].  Nonetheless,  increasing  the  hydrogen  inclusion  rate
beyond  a  certain  level  could  cause  knocking  [17].  Furthermore,  the
small quenching distance of the hydrogen flame increases the likelihood
of  the  flame  reaching  the  combustion  chamber  walls,  leading  to
increased  convective  heat  transfer  to  the  walls  and  decreased  BTE  at
higher hydrogen inclusion rates [153]. Therefore, the exact impact of
hydrogen addition on BTE will depend on the specific engine design and
operating conditions.

While some studies have found that adding hydrogen to diesel fuel
could improve combustion efficiency, others have reported the opposite
[113,159]. Varde and Frame [160] have argued that the improper piston
position during peak in-cylinder pressure because of hydrogen inclusion
into diesel fuel might reduce the BTE of diesel engines. This issue could
be  addressed  by  adjusting  diesel  fuel  injection  timing,  either  by
advancing  or  retarding  it,  to  achieve  optimal  combustion  timing  and
avoid negative effects on engine performance. While adding hydrogen to
the air can result in more heat absorption by hydrogen molecules, it may
not  necessarily  lead  to  a  decrease  in  flame  temperature.  However,
introducing hydrogen can decrease the amount of oxygen available for
combustion,  which  could result  in  deteriorated  combustion  efficiency
[161]. It should be noted that the molar heat capacity of hydrogen is
higher than that of nitrogen, which could potentially increase the overall
heat  capacity  of  the  mixture.  However,  adding  hydrogen  to  the  air
usually  results  in  a  higher  overall  equivalence  ratio,  increasing  com-
bustion temperature. On the other hand, the low BTE of hydrogen diesel
dual-fuel operation could be attributed to high cooling losses resulting
from  the  short  quenching  distance  and  high  thermal  conductivity  of
hydrogen, which can intensify convective heat loss and lower the en-
gine’s  overall  efficiency  [162].  Furthermore,  the  heat  loss  rate  is
increased by adding hydrogen to diesel fuel due to increased wall heat
flux, resulting in reduced BTE [163].

Adding hydrogen to diesel fuel at different engine loads could lead to

varying trends in the performance of diesel engines [16,164].

Adding  hydrogen  can  decrease  the  BTE  of  diesel  engines  at  lower
loads. This result is because, at lower loads, the diesel fuel injection rate
is lower, and as a result, the pilot diesel may not be sufficient to burn all
the  hydrogen  introduced  into  the  combustion  chamber.  However,  at
higher engine loads, an improvement in the BTE of diesel engines can be
observed by introducing hydrogen into the combustion chamber. This
result is because the rate of pilot diesel injection into the combustion
chamber  is  high  at  elevated  engine  loads,  providing  robust  ignition
sources  for  gaseous  fuel  combustion  [165].  Interestingly,  hydrogen
could enhance the burning of the injected diesel fuel at higher engine
loads  because of the  wider flammability limits of  its premixed  flame.
Accordingly,  most  of  the  air-fuel  mixture  is  combusted  within  the
combustion chamber. In addition, by increasing the hydrogen supple-
ment rate at higher engine loads, high flammability limits of hydrogen

and its subsequent high combustion rate could increase the in-cylinder
pressure  [166].  These  issues  could  collectively  enhance  the  BTE  of
hydrogen  diesel  dual-fuel  operation  at  higher  engine  loads.  Notably,
injecting  hydrogen  and  diesel  fuel  is  done  separately  in  dual-fuel  en-
gines. It is important to mention that in most of the published research
on this topic, the inclusion rate of hydrogen is not dependent on engine
operating  conditions  (load  and  speed),  regardless  of  the  hydrogen
addition method. Hence, the hydrogen-to-diesel ratio can be varied to
ensure stable combustion and enhance the engine’s performance.

In  several  studies, biodiesel  has  been  shown  to reduce  the  BTE  of
diesel  engines  because  of  its  lower  calorific  value,  higher  viscosity,
lower volatility, and higher density [167,168]. Hydrogen addition could
resolve the shortcomings of biodiesel, as confirmed in various studies
[56,169]. The high energy release rate of hydrogen and the high in-built
oxygen  content  of  biodiesel  fuel  could  synergistically  promote  com-
bustion  efficiency,  leading  to  improved  BTE  [170].  More  specifically,
the higher flame speed of gaseous hydrogen than liquid biodiesel could
improve combustion efficiency [56,171]. The improvement in the BTE
of biodiesel-fueled engines could also be attributed to the higher ener-
getic value of hydrogen and its better mixing ability with air [172]. In
addition,  the  higher  diffusivity  and  lower  quenching  distance  of
hydrogen  could  enhance  the  combustion  process  of  biodiesel-fueled
engines [52].

However, hyper-induction of hydrogen could make the combustion
process too rapid because of more ignition centers, lowering the BTE of
biodiesel-fueled  engines  [54,55].  Hyper-induction  of  hydrogen  can
cause more ignition centers because hydrogen has a lower ignition delay
time compared to other fuels. When hydrogen is hyper-induced, more
hydrogen molecules are available in the combustion chamber, resulting
in more ignition sources. These additional ignition sources can initiate
combustion at different locations in the chamber, leading to a faster and
less controlled combustion process. As a result, the BTE of the engine can
be lowered due to incomplete combustion or excessive heat loss.

The  combustion  efficiency  of  hydrogen  can  be  synergistically
enhanced by the high in-built oxygen content of biodiesel fuel, resulting
in improved BTE. However, the impact of adding hydrogen to biodiesel
on BTE under different engine loading conditions is not always clear-cut
[173,174].  At  lower  engine  loads,  the  addition  of  hydrogen  could
deteriorate BTE because of incomplete combustion of the too-lean air--
hydrogen mixture, as the low amount of injected pilot fuel may not be
sufficient  to  burn  all  the  hydrogen  introduced  into  the  combustion
in  some
chamber  [54].  The
hydrogen-fueled engines can be attributed to two factors: the low flame
speed of the air-hydrogen mixture and higher thermal losses due to the
higher  wall  heat  flux  of  the  hydrogen  flame  at  lower  engine  loads.
Conversely, at higher engine loads, the BTE of biodiesel-fueled engines
could be improved by adding hydrogen because of the enrichment of the
air-fuel  mixture and the higher  in-cylinder temperatures [173]. How-
ever, it is important to note that higher hydrogen inclusion rates may
lead  to  severe  knocking  at  higher  engine  loads  due  to  hydrogen
pre-ignition [175].

incomplete  combustion  observed

Reportedly,  adding  nanoadditives  to  diesel  fuel  blends  could
improve  the  BTE  of  hydrogen-fueled  diesel  engines  because  of  their
superior catalytic effect [145,176,177]. This result could also be related
to  the  lower  volatility  of  nano-doped  diesel  fuel  blends  [176].  The
higher specific surface area and thermal conductivity of nanoparticles
could improve BTE in hydrogen-fueled diesel engines by increasing the
fuel  evaporation  rate  and  reducing  the  ignition  delay  [178].  Adding
oxygenated  nanoparticles  (e.g.,  TiO2,  Al2O3,  CuO,  and  CeO2)  could
improve  the  combustion  characteristics  of  hydrogen-fueled  diesel  en-
gines  by  providing  extra  oxygen  to  the  combustion  chamber  [145].
However, unlike the above arguments, it has been reported that adding
nanoparticles
the  BTE  of
hydrogen-fueled diesel  engines  because of their lower  cetane number
[176]. Although hydrogen fuel can slightly compensate for the low ce-
tane  number  of  nanoparticles,  this  improvement  is  not  significant

enough to surpass the performance of pure diesel fuel [176]. Further-
more,  adding  nanoparticles  to  diesel  fuel  beyond  a  specific  amount
might negatively affect the stability of the combustion process [178].
Numerous studies have demonstrated that adding oxygenated addi-
tives can enhance the BTE of diesel engines running on hydrogen fuel
[146,147,169,179]. Adding oxygenated additives with a higher latent
heat of vaporization could cool down the inlet charge by about 15
C,
increasing the inlet charge density and improving the combustion pro-
cess  [180–182].  In  addition,  some  oxygenated  additives  (e.g.,  diethyl
ether) could reduce the viscosity of the fuel blends, thus improving the
spraying/atomization  process  and  boosting  the  combustion  quality
[179]. Adding some oxygenated additives (e.g., diethyl ether) could also
increase the cetane number of diesel fuel blends. An increase in cetane
number could cause a shorter ignition delay, improving the combustion
of  the  fuel  injected  [179].  In  contrast,  some  researchers  found  that
adding oxygenated additives to diesel fuel could not improve the BTE of
hydrogen-fueled diesel engines [146,169,183] due to their lower calo-
rific value and cetane number [169].

◦

The comparative brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) parameter
represents the quantity of fuel used per unit of brake power generated by
an  engine  [183].  There  are  two  ways  to  calculate  the  BSFC  of  a
hydrogen-fueled  diesel  engine.  The  sum  of  hydrogen  and  diesel  mass
flow rates in the first approach is divided by the corresponding gener-
ated power [16,184,185]. In the second approach, the mass flow rate of
hydrogen fuel is first converted into equivalent diesel fuel based on their
lower  heating  values.  The  sum  of  the  diesel  mass  flow  rate  and  its
equivalent  because of hydrogen consumption is divided by  the corre-
sponding generated power [18,186]. Both approaches present the result
in g/kWh or kg/kWh. The second approach is more realistic and reliable
than  the  first.  The  discussions  made  in  this  review  are  based  on  the
second approach. Notably, the results obtained using the first approach
might be misleading when the investigated fuels have different densities
and calorific values [187].

Adding  hydrogen  to  the  air  in  diesel  engines  has  been  shown  to
reduce  BSFC  in  various  studies  [150,188].  The  high  diffusivity  of
gaseous hydrogen allows for a well-homogenized mixture with intake
air,  and  the  higher  flame  velocity  and  calorific  value  of  hydrogen
compared to hydrocarbons can enhance the combustion of injected fuel
and increase the generated brake power while lowering BSFC [110,119,
155,184]. However, increasing the hydrogen introduction rate beyond a
certain level could decrease fuel consumption efficiency. This issue is
because an  oxygen-depleted environment  can hinder  the oxidation of
hydrogen  and  hydrocarbons,  resulting  in  incomplete  combustion  and
increased BSFC [184].

Despite some studies suggesting that adding hydrogen to diesel en-
gines can improve their performance, others contradict this claim [18,
113].  This  result  is  because  adding  hydrogen  to  the  intake  air  can
decrease the oxygen concentration  in the combustion chamber, nega-
tively  affecting  combustion  efficiency  [184].  In  addition,  the  in-
compatibility of diesel fuel injection timing with hydrogen enrichment
can lead to an inappropriate combustion period, resulting in a shortened
combustion duration [18]. When the combustion duration is too short,
the fuel may not burn completely, and the chemical energy of the fuel
cannot  be  entirely  converted  into  thermal  energy.  This  incomplete
combustion  leads  to  a  decrease  in  the  brake  power  generated  by  the
engine and an increase in BSFC.

The magnitude of the energy required by an engine to generate a unit
of brake power is called “Brake Specific Energy Consumption (BSEC)”.
This performance indicator is independent of fuel properties, making it a
more reliable criterion than BSFC [189]. Several studies have reported
that hydrogen addition to diesel fuel could improve the BSEC of diesel
engines [155,190]. Promoting combustion reactions because of the high
flame speed and calorific content of hydrogen could lower the BSEC of
diesel  engines  [132].  The  formation  of  a  more  homogenized  air-fuel
mixture owing to the high diffusivity of hydrogen could also be regar-
ded as another main reason for the BSEC reduction [150,155]. However,

it  should  be  worth  noting  that  too  much  hydrogen  could  negatively
affect the in-cylinder oxidant concentration, deteriorating the combus-
tion efficiency [158]. Contrary to some studies, some researchers sug-
gest that using hydrogen in diesel engines may increase BSEC [110]. The
incompatibility  of  compression  ignition  diesel  engines  with  gaseous
hydrogen could lead to deteriorated combustion efficiency, increasing
BSEC  [110].  Reportedly,  increasing  the  mass  flow  rate  of  hydrogen
could further increase the BSEC of diesel engines [158].

The BSFC of diesel engines fueled with biodiesel has been reportedly
higher than those powered by diesel due to the high structural oxygen
content  and  the  low  energetic  content  of  biodiesel  [168].  This  issue
could also be attributed to the higher density of biodiesel than diesel,
resulting  in  more  fuel  injection  into  the  combustion  chamber  [169].
Hydrogen could favorably lower the BSFC of biodiesel-fueled engines
because of its superior heating value [191]. More specifically, the high
heating value of hydrogen could elevate the peak in-cylinder temper-
ature/pressure,  accelerate  the  combustion  process,  and  increase  the
mean  indicated  pressure  [192].  The  gaseous  hydrogen  with  a  wide
flammability range, high flame velocity, and short quenching distance
could ensure complete biodiesel combustion, lowering BSFC [193]. The
formation  of  a  more  homogenized  air-hydrogen  mixture  in  the  com-
bustion chamber before fuel injection could also boost power generation
per  fuel  consumption  [1]. However,  it  has  been  reported that adding
hydrogen to biodiesel-fueled engines could increase their BSFC because
of  the  inadequacy  of  the  injected  pilot  fuel  and  the  incomplete  com-
bustion of hydrogen in the air-hydrogen charge [173]. The mentioned
issue could be resolved at higher engine loads because of an increase in
the pilot fuel injection and an improvement in the combustion of the
air-hydrogen  charge  [173].  In  addition,  adding  hydrogen  could
compensate for the low energetic content of biodiesel while lowering the
BSEC of biodiesel-fueled engines because of the above reasons [194].

Doping diesel fuel blends with nanoadditives could lower the BSFC of
hydrogen-fueled  diesel  engines  by  improving  the  combustion  quality
[176–178]. Nanoadditives could accelerate combustion while boosting
the  oxidation  of  unburned  carbon  particles  [145].  The  oxygenated
nanoparticles  could  increase  the  oxygen  content  of  the  fuel  blends,
enhancing the combustion process. Nanoadditives could also reduce fuel
burning  in  the  diffusion  phase  and  improve  combustion  efficiency
[178]. The carbon content in the carbonous nanoadditives could also
increase  carbon  oxidation  while  lowering  the  fuel  consumption  rate
[178].

Some  researchers  have  shown  that  oxygenated  additives  could
decrease the fuel consumption rate of hydrogen-fueled diesel engines by
providing  fuel-bound  oxygen  content  [169,179,195].  The  lower  flash
point,  higher  cetane number,  higher  volatility, and  lower viscosity of
some oxygenated additives (e.g., diethyl  ether) than diesel fuel  could
improve the combustion process [179]. It has been confirmed in various
studies  that  adding  oxygenated  additives  could  reduce  the  BSEC  of
hydrogen-fueled diesel engines [180,181,196]. The reduction in BSEC
could be achieved because of a decrease in inlet charge temperature by
about  15
C  and  a  consequent  increase  in  charge  density  [180,181].
Unlike the above arguments, oxygenated additives might increase the
BSFC/BSEC of hydrogen-fueled diesel engines because the fuel-bound
oxygen content reduces calorific value [146].

4.2. Combustion parameters

-  In-cylinder pressure

Generally, hydrogen inclusion in diesel  fuel could increase the in-
cylinder pressure [132,197] because of instantaneous combustion in a
constant  volume  [158].  In  better  words,  hydrogen  could  delay  the
ignition  of  the  charge,  resulting  in  the  explosive  combustion  process
[198]. Gaseous hydrogen could promote diesel fuel combustion because
of its excellent mixing capacity with air [156]. The high flammability
and  rapid  combustion  of  hydrogen  could  also  elevate  the  in-cylinder

203].  Hydrogen  could  enhance  the  combustion  process  of  biodiesel
because of having high flame speed, leading to more energy release and
elevating the in-cylinder pressure [204]. Hydrogen addition could pro-
long  the  ignition  delay  of  biodiesel,  resulting  in  the  combustion  of  a
significant portion of the air-fuel mixture in the premixed combustion
phase. The higher diffusion rate of hydrogen could also create turbu-
lence within the combustion chamber, thereby elevating the in-cylinder
pressure  [205].  Increasing  the  in-cylinder  pressure  in  response  to
hydrogen  addition  to  biodiesel  could  become  more  pronounced  at
full-load operation. This extreme rise in the in-cylinder pressure could
be attributed to the fact that all the hydrogen molecules/radicals could
be combusted rapidly at higher combustion temperatures [206].

However, hyper-induction of hydrogen could lower the in-cylinder
pressure  since  a  significant  decrease  in  the  biodiesel/hydrogen  ratio
could cause poor ignition and combustion [53]. Adding more hydrogen
to biodiesel fuel could dramatically reduce the overall fuel/air equiva-
lence  ratio,  prolonging  ignition  delay  and  deteriorating  combustion
[53]. According to several studies, adding hydrogen to biodiesel could
not increase the in-cylinder pressure under all engine loading conditions
[53,173].  Hydrogen  addition  could  lower  the  in-cylinder  pressure  of
biodiesel-fueled engines at lower engine loads owing to the highly lean
air-hydrogen mixture and relatively poor combustion efficiency [173].
Unlike lower engine loads, the higher in-cylinder temperatures at higher
engine  loads  could  lead  to  the  complete  combustion  of  a  significant
portion of the hydrogen supplied to the combustion chamber. Accord-
ingly,  hydrogen  inclusion  could  increase  the  in-cylinder  pressure  of
biodiesel-fueled engines at higher engine loads [173].

Several  studies  have  shown  that  nanoadditives  could  increase  the
cylinder pressure of hydrogen-fueled diesel engines by further elevating
the flame propagation speed [145]. In addition, the highly conductive
nanoadditives could accelerate fuel evaporation and shorten the ignition
delay,  increasing  the  cylinder  pressure  [145].  Oxygenated  additives

pressure  [165,199].  Adding  hydrogen  could  significantly  prolong  the
premixed combustion phase. As a result, a smaller portion of the sup-
plied fuel may be burned during the diffusion phase. Most of the pro-
vided fuel burned in the premixed combustion phase could increase the
in-cylinder  pressure  [198].  However,  at  lower  engine  loads,  adding
more  hydrogen  could  cause  a  late  start  of  combustion  because  of  a
reduction in the diesel fuel quantity (ignition source) injected into the
combustion  chamber  [200].  This  reduction  could  demote  the
hydrogen-air  mixture  combustion  process,  lowering  the  in-cylinder
pressure [200,201].

Several  studies  have  shown  the  positive  effect  of  hydrogen  on
increasing the in-cylinder pressure of biodiesel-fueled engines [169,202,

could also reduce the ignition delay and increase the cylinder pressure,
as documented in some studies [146,179]. The high volatility, structural
oxygen content, and high cetane number of some oxygenated additives
could cause localized stoichiometric air/fuel ratio conditions, improving
the  combustion  quality  and  increasing  the  cylinder  pressure  [179].
However,  oxygenated  additives  might  lower  the  cylinder  pressure  of
hydrogen-fueled  diesel  engines  because  of  possessing  a  higher  latent
heat of vaporization [181,182]. Therefore, adding oxygenated additives
could reduce the inlet and overall charge temperature, reducing com-
bustion chamber pressure [181,182].

-  Heat release rate

The heat release rate indicator represents how quickly the chemical
energy  of  a  fuel  is  released  during  combustion  [207].  A  typical  heat
release diagram for single-fuel diesel engine combustion comprises four
main stages: ignition delay, premixed/rapid combustion stage, mixing
controlled  combustion/diffusion  burning  stage,  and  late  combustion
stage (Fig. 13) [33]. Concisely, the time elapsed between the injection
and combustion initiation is defined as “ignition delay” [208]. The fuel
introduced into the combustion chamber is atomized and vaporized. The
ignition of the evaporated fuel, called the “premixed combustion phase”,
occurs when a sufficient amount of fuel has been evaporated and fused
with  oxygen  long  enough  at  the  proper  temperature  [209].  In  the
mixing-controlled combustion/diffusion burning phase, the combustion
process remains steady up to the termination of fuel injection after the
combustion  stabilization  and  initiation  at  an  almost  fixed  distance
downstream of the injection nozzle [210]. In the late burning phase, the
unburned products from the previous stages are combusted [211].

As explained above, the combustion process of the hydrogen-diesel
dual-fuel operation mode is mechanistically different from that of the
single-diesel operation mode [69,213]. The combustion of premixed fuel
in dual-fuel operation mode is significantly governed by the pilot-fuel
burning  phase,  as  shown  in  Fig.  14  [214].  The  difference  between
dual-fuel  and  single-diesel  operation  modes  is  further  elaborated  and
discussed by Kahila et al. [215], as shown in Fig. 15. They have argued
that  single  and  dual-fuel  combustion  modes  comprise  three  common
stages,  including  turbulent  mixing,  first-stage  ignition  (volumetric
activation  of  low-temperature  chemistry),  and  second-stage  ignition
(volumetric activation of high-temperature chemistry at the spray tip)
[215].  Unlike  a  single-fuel  spray  where  high-temperature  ignition  is
continued by a highly luminous lifted quasi-steady diffusion flame, the

ignition process is continued by a premixed gas-air flame initiation and
its  consequent  propagation  for  a  dual-fuel  pilot  spray  (space  IV  in
Fig. 15) [215].

Various investigations have indicated that adding hydrogen to diesel
fuel could increase the heat release rate [199,216]. Adding hydrogen to
diesel fuel could improve combustion efficiency, yielding an apparent
rise  in  the  heat  release  rate  during  the  mixing-controlled  combustion
stage [153,217]. The high flame speed of hydrogen could also increase
the  heat  release  rate  in  the  premixed  combustion  stage  [5,186].  This
increment  could  probably  be  because  of  cooperation  between  the
diffusion  combustion  of  diesel  and  the  premixed  combustion  of
hydrogen,  which  could  combust  hydrogen  instantaneously  via  propa-
gating  multiple  turbulent  flames  triggered  by  the  diesel  combustion
[115,132,218]. Hydrogen addition to diesel fuel could make the injected
diesel  fuel  insufficient  to  burn  the  inducted  gaseous  fuel  completely.
This reduction could decrease the heat required for diesel fuel vapor-
ization between the premixed and mixing-controlled combustion stages
and increase the heat release rate [219].

Unlike  the  above  arguments,  increasing  the  hydrogen  supplement
rate beyond a certain level could increase the heat release rate in the
premixed combustion stage while decreasing this combustion parameter
in  the  mixing-controlled  combustion  stage  [18].  Furthermore,  more
hydrogen addition to diesel fuel could deteriorate volumetric efficiency
and  reduce  ignition  source  quantity,  impoverishing  the  diesel-air
mixture.  Therefore,  sufficient  flame  cores  could  not  be  provided,
which  decreases  the  heat  release  rate  [197].  It  should  also  be  worth
noting that higher hydrogen supplement rates could drastically increase
the peak heat release rate, leading  to an abnormal  knock, such as an
explosion [201].

Various studies have shown that hydrogen addition could increase
the  heat  release  rate  of  biodiesel-fueled  engines  because  of  the  fast
combustion  properties,  high  flame  speed,  and  high  heating  value  of
gaseous  fuel  [192,203,205,220].  This  result  could  also  be  related  to
forming lower intermediate combustion products in hydrogen-biodiesel
dual-fuel  engines, such  as  CO,  UHC, and  soot  [221].  Hydrogen  could
prolong the ignition delay of biodiesel-fueled engines, providing enough
time for biodiesel evaporation and increasing the heat release rate [204,
222]. However, adding hydrogen to biodiesel-fueled engines could not
necessarily increase their heat release rates under different engine loads
[53,173]. The low combustion efficiency of hydrogen at lower engine
loads  could  reduce  the  heat  release  rate  of  biodiesel-fueled  engines
[173]. In addition, the low in-cylinder gas temperature at lower engine

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience98(2023)10110014

S.H. Hosseini et al.

loading levels could not combust the air-hydrogen mixture sufficiently
at the early stage of the expansion stroke. Instead, a significant portion
of the supplied hydrogen could be combusted at the last period of the
expansion  stroke  or  exhausted  unburned  [173].  The  highly  lean
air-hydrogen  mixture  could  also  be  another  reason  for  the  low  heat
release rate at lower engine loads [173].

It has been documented that doping diesel fuels with nanoadditives
could increase the heat release rate of hydrogen-fueled diesel engines
[145].  The  high  surface  area  of  nanoparticles  could  accelerate  the
evaporation  of  the  injected  fuel,  shortening  the  ignition  delay  and
boosting  the  heat  release  rate  [145].  The  oxygenated  nanoparticles
could increase the diffusion combustion phase and decrease the com-
bustion  duration,  thus  increasing  the  heat  release  rate  [145].  Adding
oxygenated additives to diesel fuel could also increase the heat release
rate of hydrogen-fueled diesel engines by promoting combustion [147,
179].  Some  high-volatile  oxygenated  additives,  such  as  diethyl  ether,
could accumulate fuel within the combustion chamber during the pre-
mixed combustion phase, increasing the heat release rate [179]. How-
ever, adding oxygenated additives beyond a certain concentration could
decrease  the  heat  release  rate  because  of  their  lower  calorific  value
[179]. Oxygenated additives could also reduce inlet charge temperature
and prolong ignition delay [180,181]. According to several studies, the
heat  release  rate  of  hydrogen-fueled  diesel  engines  ignited  with  die-
sel/biodiesel/oxygenated  blends  could  be  lower  than  diesel/biodiesel
blends  [180,182,195].  The  instantaneous  combustion  of  high-volatile
oxygenated  additives  might
the  heat  release  rate  of
lower
hydrogen-fueled diesel engines [182].

-  Ignition delay

The  ignition  delay  is  the  time  span  between  the  inception  of  the
diesel introduction into the combustion chamber and the inception of
the combustion process [223]. Generally, hydrogen addition could in-
crease the ignition delay of diesel engines [156,219]. The lower cetane
number and higher self-ignition temperature of gaseous hydrogen than
diesel  fuel  lead  to  an  inherently  higher  ignition  delay  for  hydrogen
[224]. In addition, the quantity of the injected diesel fuel is insufficient
to  burn  all  the  hydrogen  supplied  into  the  combustion  chamber.  The
formation of the poor air-fuel mixture could then prolong the premixed
combustion  phase,  postponing  the  inception  of  heat  release  while
increasing the ignition delay period [197]. Substituting diesel fuel with
hydrogen could decrease the low-temperature fuel reaction rates due to
lower  oxygen  levels  resulting  from  charge  dilution.  Notably,  the
low-temperature reactions could be responsible for initiating the chain
reactions by generating reactive radicals [201].

Adding  hydrogen  to  the  air-fuel  mixture  could  lead  to  the  con-
sumption of high-reactive OH radical by the OH + H2––H + H2O reac-
tion and suppression of the hydrogen atom abstraction rate of n-heptane
by the n-C7H16+OH––C7H15+H2O reaction [225]. Instead of generating
highly reactive OH radicals, the formation of poorly reactive HO2  and
H2O2 radicals resulting from hydrogen addition could also diminish the
low-temperature oxidation of diesel fuel, prolonging the ignition delay
[225]. Unlike the arguments mentioned above, it should be noted that
adding more hydrogen could shorten the ignition delay because of an
increase in  the in-cylinder  gas temperature caused by hydrogen com-
bustion [226].

Various  studies  have  shown  that  hydrogen  addition  to  biodiesel
could unfavorably increase ignition delay because of the higher auto-
ignition  temperature  of  hydrogen  than  biodiesel  [47,56,204].  The
addition of hydrogen may cause a decrease in the oxygen concentration
in  the  fuel  mixture,  which  can  result  in  an  increased  ignition  delay
[202].  The  prolonged  ignition  delay  could  become  a  serious  issue  at
higher hydrogen inclusion rates because of a significant reduction in the
pilot  fuel  quantity  [53,55].  The  ignition  delay  of  hydrogen-biodiesel
dual-fuel engines at lower engine loads could be longer than at higher
engine loads. The oxygen inadequacy resulting from the hydrogen fuel

substitution in the air at lower engine loads could prolong ignition delay.
However, higher in-cylinder temperatures at higher engine loads could
partially  compensate  for  the  oxygen  deficiency  and  shorten  ignition
delay [220]. It has also been rarely reported that hydrogen addition to
biodiesel could shorten ignition delay [227]. The high premixed com-
bustion rate and hydrogen flame speed of the hydrogen might possibly
reduce the ignition delay of biodiesel-fueled engines [227].

Like combustion duration, published literature has not yet provided
comprehensive information regarding additive effects on ignition delay
in hydrogen-fueled diesel engines. Because of their high specific surface
area, thermal conductivity, and catalytic effect, metallic nanoparticles
are  expected  to  shorten  ignition  delay  [228–230].  It  is  expected  that
metallic nanoparticles will enhance the evaporation rate of the injected
fuel, resulting in a better combustion process and reducing the physical
delay [228]. Carbonous nanoparticles are also expected to speed up fuel
evaporation, catalyze oxidation reactions, and provide exothermic heat,
thus decreasing ignition delay.

Adding  some  oxygenated  additives  (e.g.,  alcohols)  to  diesel/bio-
diesel  blends  is  expected  to  prolong  the  ignition  delay  of  hydrogen-
fueled  diesel  engines  because  of  having  a  lower  cetane  number
(causing  chemical  delay)  and  a  higher  latent  heat  of  vaporization
(causing  physical  delay)  than  diesel  [231,232].  Heavy  alcohols  (e.g.,
butanol)  are  also  expected  to  prolong  ignition  delay  by  causing  poor
atomization/evaporation  and  worsening  combustion  because  of  their
higher viscosity and lower oxygen content [231]. However, it is envis-
aged  that  some  high  cetane  number  oxygenated  additives,  such  as
diethyl ether, will shorten the ignition delay of hydrogen-fueled diesel
engines by decreasing the quantity of the air-fuel mixture formed during
the  ignition  delay  period  and  consequently  decreasing  the  cylinder
pressure [233].

-  Combustion duration

The  difference  between  crank  angle  positions  in  degrees  between
10% and 90% mass fraction burn points is termed “combustion dura-
tion” [234]. According to various studies [18,153], hydrogen addition
could  shorten  the  combustion  duration  because  of  the  high  burning
velocity of gaseous hydrogen [18,235] and thus accelerating the air-fuel
mixing process [225]. Moreover, hydrogen incorporation into diesel fuel
could sharply increase the peak heat release rate in the premixed and
mixing-controlled combustion stages, shortening the combustion dura-
tion  [236].  Notably,  a  shorter  combustion  duration  could  lead  to  a
heavier  combustion  knock,  which  could  be  observed  by  the  peak
in-cylinder pressure [130]. In contrast with the above discussions, some
studies  have  shown  that  hydrogen  supplementation  at  lower  engine
loads could prolong combustion duration [10,165]. In fact, the ignition
centers  could  be  reduced  at  lower  engine  loads,  decreasing  the  com-
bustion  rate  of  the  primary  air-fuel  mixture  [165].  Furthermore,  the
hydrogen-air mixture could be weaker than the stoichiometric at lower
engine loads, lowering the flame propagation speed [10].

Generally,  the  burning  rate  of  the  air-hydrogen  mixture  is  signifi-
cantly higher than the air-biodiesel mixture because of the higher and
more turbulent flame propagation speed of hydrogen [202,220,237]. In
addition, hydrogen addition could speed up the combustion reactions
due to increased combustion chamber temperature, thereby shortening
the  combustion  duration  [204].  Introducing  pilot  fuel  into  the
air-hydrogen  mixture  could  result  in  robust  ignition  centers  while
accelerating combustion [55,56].

The effect of nanoadditives and oxygenated additives on the com-
bustion duration of hydrogen-fueled diesel engines has not been studied
in the published literature. However, it is expected that nanoadditives
will reduce the combustion duration of hydrogen-fueled diesel engines.
The  large  surface  area  of  nanoparticles  might  increase  the  reactive
surface area with air, promote fuel evaporation, enhance atomization,
and homogenize the air-fuel mixture [230]. In addition, nanoparticles
might catalyze combustion reactions, improving the combustion process

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience98(2023)10110015

S.H. Hosseini et al.

and reducing the combustion duration [238]. The injected fuel might
also effectively interact with the oxygen of oxygenated nanoadditives
through their reduction, for example, CeO2 into Ce2O3 [239]. The high
exothermic  heat  generated  during  the  decomposition  of  carbonous
nanoparticles  might  enhance  fuel  burning  and  shorten  combustion
duration [239].

The higher structural oxygen content of oxygenated additives could
facilitate the oxidation of hydrocarbons within the combustion chamber
[238]. The addition of oxygenated additives to diesel/biodiesel blends
can  reduce  combustion  duration  through  two  mechanisms:  first,  the
prolonged ignition delay due to the increased premixed burn, and sec-
ond, the enhanced mixing resulting from the micro-explosion phenom-
enon  [240].  The  highly  volatile  oxygenated  additives  (e.g.,  diethyl
ether) could form various ignition centers in the combustion chamber by
reducing the  latent  heat of vaporization  of  the fuel  blend, shortening
combustion duration [241]. The lower fuel viscosity and boiling point of
some oxygenated additives (e.g., methanol) could improve the homo-
geneity of the air-fuel mixture because of a broad fuel spray penetration,
shortening combustion duration [238].

4.3. Exhaust emissions

-  Carbon monoxide emissions

CO emissions result from the incomplete oxidation of carbon atoms
because  of  the  formation  of  the  fuel-rich  mixture  in  oxygen-depleted
environments.  This  pollutant  can  also  be  generated  at  combustion
temperatures  below  approximately  1180
C  [76].  The  CO  generation
from the hydrocarbon radical (R) is presented by the following reaction
[123]:

◦

RH → R → RO2 → RCHO → RCO→CO

(1)

The generated CO in the combustion process is then slowly oxidized

in hydrocarbon-air flame to CO2 as follows [123]:

CO + OH = CO2 + H

(2)

Table S4 tabulates the effects of hydrogen addition on the exhaust
emissions  from  diesel  engines  ignited  by  straight  diesel.  Adding
hydrogen to the intake air could decelerate the CO formation rate [132,
153] because of a decrease in the C/H ratio of the fuel [235]. In addition,
form  a
the  high  diffusivity  of  hydrogen
well-homogenized combustible mixture, boosting the combustion pro-
cess  while  lowering  CO  emissions  [5,216].  The  high  flame  speed  of
hydrogen  could  enhance  the  combustion  process  and  elevate  the
in-cylinder  temperature,  reducing  CO  emissions  [186,216].  This
reduction  could  also  be  attributed  to  the  fact  that  hydrogen  could
operate on a lean equivalence ratio [118,153].

the  air  could

in

In contrast to the previously mentioned benefits, it has been reported
that incorporating hydrogen into diesel fuel could potentially increase
CO  emissions.  This  result  is  because  adding  hydrogen  can  dilute  the
oxygen  concentration  in  the  air,  leading  to  increased  CO  emissions
[166].  Adding  more  hydrogen  to  diesel  fuel  could  increase  the
in-cylinder temperature, dissociating CO2 into CO and O [242]. The high
reaction  rate  of  hydrogen  could  deplete  the  oxygen  available  in  the
combustion  chamber,  leaving  less  oxygen  for  the  oxidation  of  CO.  It
should be noted that oxygen could be consumed in hydrogen oxidation
and  radical  formation  [243].  The  water  produced  by  the  hydrogen
oxidation  reaction  could  also  react  with  diesel  hydrocarbons  (steam
reforming), increasing CO emissions (Eq. (3)) [243].

Adding hydrogen to diesel fuel could increase the CO generation rate
at higher engine loads because of a significant reduction in the oxygen
concentration  and  reaction  time  [244].  However,  a  reduction  in  CO

emissions could be observed by adding hydrogen to diesel fuel at lower
engine  loads  because  of  the  sufficiency  of  oxygen  in  leaner  air-fuel
mixtures [244].

As presented in Table S5, almost all investigations have observed a
decreasing trend in CO emissions by adding hydrogen to biodiesel [169,
173,203].  In  general,  compression  ignition  engines  emit  less  CO  in
regular operation because of their fuel-lean combustion nature [202].
This reduction becomes more substantial for biodiesel fuel because of its
fuel-bound  oxygen  content  [245].  Nevertheless,  adding  hydrogen  to
biodiesel could further reduce CO emissions because of a decrease in the
quantity  of  carbon  introduced  to  the  combustion  chamber  [53,246].
Hydrogen’s fast burning velocity and rapid flame propagation can in-
crease in-cylinder temperature, especially towards the end of the com-
bustion  cycle,  resulting  in  complete  combustion  [53,192,247].  The
introduced  hydrogen  molecules  could  react  rapidly  with  the  in-built
oxygen  of  biodiesel  and  the  oxygen  present  in  the  air,  increasing  the
adiabatic  flame  temperature  and  pushing  the  combustion  process  to
lower CO emissions [1,204]. More importantly, hydrogen could signif-
icantly catalyze CO oxidation (the reaction so-called “wet mechanism”
of CO oxidation) [248]. Hydrogen addition could cause fewer over-rich
zones because of the decreased quantity of injected biodiesel, lowering
CO  emissions  [56].  Unlike  the  arguments  above,  some  studies  have
found that hydrogen addition to biodiesel could increase CO emissions
[47,227].  The  deficiency  in  oxygen  concentration  resulting  from
hydrogen induction could lead to increased CO emissions [220].

Table S6 tabulates the effects of additives on the exhaust emissions
from  hydrogen-fueled  diesel  engines.  Most  studies  have  found  that
nanoadditives can  reduce  CO emissions  in hydrogen-fueled  diesel  en-
gines. This result is because the high surface area of the additives leads
to  improved  combustion  reactions  [145,176,178].  The  oxygenated
nanoparticles  could  also  propel  the  combustion  process  toward
completion, mitigating CO emissions [176]. Likewise, adding oxygen-
ated additives to diesel/biodiesel blends could reduce the CO emissions
from  hydrogen-fueled  diesel  engines  [179,180,197].  The  oxygenated
additives  could  cause  homogeneous  air-fuel  mixtures  and  multiple
ignition  centers  within  the  combustion  chamber.  This  phenomenon
could lead to the complete combustion of the supplied fuel, reducing CO
emissions [180].

-  Carbon dioxide emissions

The greenhouse gas CO2  indicates the complete combustion of the
fuel introduced into the combustion chamber. Many researchers have
reported that adding hydrogen to diesel fuel could reduce CO2 emissions
[153,219]  because  of  the  carbon-free  structure  of  hydrogen  [186].
Moreover, the overall H/C ratio of the fuel mixture could be increased
by  adding  hydrogen,  shortening  combustion  duration,  and  improving
combustion  efficiency  [216,249].  The  high  hydrogen  diffusion  coeffi-
cient could also form a more uniform premixed ignitable mixture [132],
propelling the combustion process toward completion [216]. The high
flame  speed  propagation  of  hydrogen  could  enhance  the  combustion
efficiency of the fuel mixture, potentially leading to a reduction in CO2
emissions  [132].  However,  adding  hydrogen  at  higher  engine  load
conditions could decrease CO2 emissions due to combustion instability
and oxygen deficiency [250].

Generally, the in-built oxygen content of biodiesel could increase its
CO2 emissions [251]. However, hydrogen could lower the CO2 emissions
from  biodiesel-fueled  engines  because  of  its  carbon-free  nature  [46,
224]. Overall, hydrogen addition could increase the H/C of the supplied
fuel, thus decreasing CO2 emissions [173,227]. On the contrary, adding
hydrogen to biodiesel could rarely be observed to increase CO2  emis-
sions.  This  issue  might  probably  be  attributed  to  the  high  energetic
content of hydrogen and the consequent promotion of combustion re-
actions [222].

Unlike  the  arguments  in  the  published  literature,  nanoadditives
could decrease the CO2  emissions from hydrogen-fueled diesel engines

S.H. Hosseini et al.

[145,178]. These nanoscale additives might increase CO2 emissions by
improving combustion and oxidizing the evolved CO [252,253]. Nano-
additives  might  also  result  in uniform  burning by  shortening  ignition
delay,  leading  to  complete  combustion  [254].  In  addition,  almost  all
investigations have reported that adding oxygenated additives to die-
sel/biodiesel  blends  could
lower
from
hydrogen-fueled  diesel  engines  [180–182].  This  finding  could  be
attributed to the lower C/H ratio of oxygenated additives [180,181].

the  CO2

emissions

-  Unburned hydrocarbon emissions

UHC  indicates  the  incomplete  combustion  of  diesel  hydrocarbon.
UHC  compounds  are  usually  found  in  low-temperature  zones  of  the
combustion chamber, such as cylinder walls, where the temperature is
not  high  enough  for  the  complete  combustion  of  the  air-fuel  mixture
[76]. Some studies have documented that adding hydrogen could lower
the UHC emissions from diesel engines because of the absence of carbon
in hydrogen fuel [243]. Adding hydrogen to intake air could prolong
ignition  delay,  providing  more  time  for  better  air-fuel  mixing  before
ignition  [198].  In  addition,  the  gaseous  hydrogen  could  thoroughly
homogenize the air-fuel mixture because of its high diffusivity in the air
[150], boosting combustion efficiency while lowering UHC emissions.
The wide flammability range and short quenching distance of hydrogen
could also enhance the combustion of air-fuel mixture [158]. The high
burning velocity of hydrogen could boost diesel combustion, reducing
UHC  emissions  [244].  Hydrogen  addition  could  elevate  in-cylinder
temperature, promoting UHC post-flame oxidation [119].

On  the  contrary,  some  researchers  have  reported  that  adding
hydrogen  to  diesel  fuel  could  increase  UHC  emissions  [18,132].  This
increment  could  be  attributed  to  the  inadequacy of  the  injected  pilot
fuel,  causing  poor  ignition  of  gaseous  fuel  [166].  Hydrogen  addition
could  also  lower  the  oxygen  concentration  in  the  air-fuel  mixture,
leading  to  the  incomplete  combustion  of  diesel  fuel  [186].  The  con-
sumption  of  most  of the  oxygen supplied  to  the combustion  chamber
because  of  the  instantaneous  combustion  of  hydrogen  could  cause
incomplete combustion of the diesel fuel injected at the end of the in-
jection period [160]. The flame quenching caused by the high burning
velocity  of  hydrogen  could  also  increase  UHC  emissions  [124].
Increasing ignition delay in fuel-lean conditions resulting from hydrogen
addition could lead to incomplete combustion [236].

There  has been general agreement in the published literature that
adding carbon-free hydrogen to biodiesel could cause a decrease in UHC
emissions [56,194,203,255]. The high flammability limit, burning rate,
and calorific value of hydrogen could aid the complete combustion of
the injected biodiesel and decrease UHC emissions [255,256]. The high
flame speed of hydrogen could also promote the homogenization of the
air-biodiesel mixture and improve the combustion process [257]. UHC
emissions  could  be decreased because of  reduced hydrocarbon intake
with  the  charge  [55].  Hydrogen  combustion  could  elevate  the
in-cylinder  temperature,  leading  to  better  oxidation  of  UHC  to  CO2
[204].  Unlike  the  above  reasonings,  it  has  been  claimed  that  adding
hydrogen  to  biodiesel  could  increase  UHC  emissions  at  lower  engine
loading  levels  [173].  The  observed  increase  in  ignition  delay  in
hydrogen-fueled diesel engines may be attributed to insufficient injected
pilot fuel to initiate the ignition of the air-fuel mixture.

Reportedly, nanoadditives could mitigate  the UHC emissions  from
hydrogen-fueled  diesel  engines  by  acting  as  oxidation  catalysts  [145,
176–178].  Nanoparticles  could  reduce  flame  quenching  as  the  main
reason  for  incomplete  combustion  and  UHC  formation  [178].  Nano-
additives could increase the flame propagation speed and thus lower the
carbon  activation  temperature  [145].  Oxygenated  metallic  nano-
particles could also act as an oxygen buffer, thus lowering UHC emis-
sions [176]. The higher specific surface area and energetic content of
carbonous nanoparticles could markedly reduce UHC emissions.

It has been observed that oxygenated additives could decrease the
UHC  emissions  from  hydrogen-fueled  diesel  engines  because  of  their

diesel combustion [269] and the changes observed in the presence of hydrogen.

structural oxygen and lower C/H ratio [179,180,196]. The higher cetane
number  and  volatility  of  some  oxygenated  additives  could  enhance
combustion, thus lowering UHC emissions. Unlike the arguments above,
it  has  been  claimed  in  some  studies  that  the  higher  latent  heat  of
vaporization and the lower cetane number of some oxygenated additives
could  yield  slower  and  poor  air-fuel  mixing  [147,169].  Oxygenated
additives  could  also  reduce  the  cylinder  charge  temperature,  thereby
lowering combustion temperature and increasing UHC emissions [182].
This issue could also be attributed to the instantaneous combustion of
hydrogen  and  oxygenated  additives  during  the  diffusion  combustion
period, resulting in a deficiency in oxygen concentration [182].

-  Nitrogen oxide emissions

The  NOx  formation  rate  in  internal  combustion  diesel  engines
considerably depends on oxygen content, the residence time of the air-
fuel mixture, and in-cylinder temperature. Fig. 16 schematically illus-
trates NOx and soot formation in compression ignition diesel engines. In
simple terms, atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen could undergo a series
of  chemical  reactions,  leading  to  NOx  formation  in  high-temperature
zones [168].

ignition

(PCCI),  and

As  shown  in  Fig.  16,  conventional  diesel  combustion  emits  high
levels of NOx and soot because of its diffusion flame combustion char-
acteristics  [258].  Combustion  at  low  temperatures  could  reduce  NOx
and  soot  emissions  from  diesel  engines  [259,260].  In  the  published
literature,  a  variety  of  low-temperature  combustion  techniques,
including homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI), premixed
charge  compression
reactivity-controlled
compression  ignition  (RCCI),  have  been  introduced  and  examined
[259]. The RCCI approach has attracted much attention because it could
operate over a wide range of engine loads with near-zero levels of NOx
and soot (as shown in Fig. 16) by adjusting fuel fractions and modifying
injection strategies [261–263]. RCCI engines control the formation of
reactivity  in  the  cylinder,  thereby  controlling  the  combustion  phase
[259]. In this dual-fuel combustion mode, at least two fuels of different
reactivity  are  used  [262,264].  Air-fuel  homogeneity  is  ensured  using
low-reactive fuels  (e.g., methanol, natural gas,  gasoline, and  ethanol)
supplied into the port, while ignition begins with a high-reactive fuel (e.
g., diesel fuel, biodiesel, and dimethyl ether) directly injected into the
chamber [265,266].

In RCCI diesel combustion, regions of the combustion chamber are
significantly cooler than in conventional diesel combustion. As a result,
piston bowl heat transfer is significantly reduced, and thermal efficiency
is increased [267]. While the RCCI combustion mode offers promising
features, its CO and UHC emissions are generally higher than conven-
tional diesel combustion [265]. RCCI engines emit much less CO and
UHC when hydrogen is added to low-reactive fuels, as proved by Kakoee
and  Gharehghani  [268].  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  adding
hydrogen to low-reactive fuels beyond a certain point may increase NOx
and soot emissions by raising the in-cylinder temperature.

Various studies have shown that adding hydrogen to diesel fuel could
increase NOx emissions [132,197]. The high calorific value of hydrogen
could  increase  the  peak  in-cylinder  pressure  and  temperature,  thus
increasing  NOx  emissions  [216].  In  addition,  the  high  flame  speed
propagation of hydrogen could result in the complete combustion pro-
cess,  elevating  the  in-cylinder  pressure  and  temperature  [182].
Hydrogen addition could also result in higher local temperatures earlier
in  the  expansion  stage,  accelerating  NOx  generation  [160].  The  long
ignition delay caused by adding hydrogen to diesel fuel could lead to
forming  a  well-mixed  air-fuel  mixture  before  ignition,  elevating
in-cylinder temperature and increasing NOx emissions [198]. It has also
been reported that NOx emissions of the hydrogen port injection method
might  be  higher  than  the  hydrogen  induction  technique  [270].  This
finding  could  be  because  the  hydrogen  port  injection  method  could
improve  combustion and  volumetric efficiency  and  increase  the  com-
bustion temperature [270].

Unlike  the  above-presented  discussions,  various  studies  have  re-
ported that hydrogen addition to diesel fuel could reduce NOx emissions
because of engine operation with a leaner mixture [271]. In fact, a very
lean equivalence ratio could lower the peak combustion temperature,
decreasing  NOx  emissions  [124].  Hydrogen  could  make  the  air-fuel
mixture more homogeneous while eliminating fuel-rich zones. Accord-
ingly, the in-cylinder temperature could steadily increase, suppressing
NOx formation [272]. NOx emissions could also be reduced at higher
hydrogen supplement rates because prolonged combustion could lower
the heat release rate [159]. The water produced from hydrogen oxida-
tion could lower the in-cylinder temperature, thereby suppressing NOx
emissions  [158].  In  addition,  adding  hydrogen  to  diesel  fuel  could
decrease the quantity of diesel fuel burned in the diffusion combustion
phase. This reduction could lower NOx emissions as a significant portion
of NOx is generated in the diffusive combustion phase [158].

The literature has been almost unanimous in associating the incre-
ment in NOx emissions from diesel engines with the use of biodiesel fuel
[273]. The unsaturated compounds and structural oxygen of biodiesel
could  justify  its  higher  NOx  emissions  than  straight  diesel  [168].  Ac-
cording to various studies, adding hydrogen to biodiesel could further
increase NOx emissions [173,194,203]. The calorific value of hydrogen
is almost four times higher than biodiesel, which could cause a dramatic
rise in the in-cylinder temperature and pressure [52,56,220]. Hydrogen
addition could prolong the ignition delay of biodiesel-fueled engines and
subsequently enhance the premixed combustion phase [56]. This change
could increase the in-cylinder temperature, forming more NOx [204].

The high flame propagation speed and rapid burning rate of hydrogen
resulting  in  better  combustion  could  also  be  another  reason  for  the
higher NOx formation in biodiesel-fueled engines. Adding hydrogen to
biodiesel could increase flame and post-flame gas temperature in favor
of NOx formation [248].

In contrast with the above discussions, various studies have found
that adding hydrogen to biodiesel could lower NOx formation at lower
engine loads [169,274]. This reduction could be attributed to the low
in-cylinder gas temperature and the imperfect combustion process under
lower  engine  loads.  However,  enhanced  combustion  and  elevated
in-cylinder  gas  temperature  could  increase  the  NOx  emissions  from
hydrogen-biodiesel  dual-fuel  engines  under  higher  engine  loads  [53].
The relation between the in-cylinder gas temperature and the NO mole
fractions for a hydrogen-biodiesel dual-fuel engine at lower and higher
engine loads has been investigated through numerical simulations by An
et al. [53]. Fig. 17 shows that the in-cylinder gas temperature and NO
mole fractions had higher values at higher engine loads than lower ones.
Nanoadditives could lower the NOx emissions from hydrogen-fueled
diesel  engines,  as  observed
in  some  studies  [176,178].  The
micro-explosion phenomena that could occur in the presence of nano-
particles could enhance the turbulence within the combustion chamber,
make  the  air-fuel  mixture  more  homogenous,  lower  the  combustion
chamber temperature, eliminate the formation of hotspots, and conse-
quently lower NOx emissions [177]. Nanoparticles could also effectively
reduce active radicals during combustion while lowering NOx formation
[145,178]. Some oxygenated nanoadditives (e.g., CeO2) could act as an
oxygen  buffer  (supplying  oxygen  during  oxidation),  consequently
decreasing  NOx  formation  [145].  However,  unlike  the  above  discus-
sions,  it  has  been  reported  in  some  investigations  that  nanoadditives
could cause higher NOx emissions from hydrogen-fueled diesel engines
[145]. Nanoparticles could elevate the in-cylinder temperature by pro-
pelling  the  combustion  process  toward  completion,  leading  to  NOx
generation at higher levels [145]. The shortened ignition delay caused
by nanoparticles could also lead to higher NOx emissions [145].

Reportedly,  oxygenated  additives  could  lower  the  NOx  emissions
from hydrogen-fueled diesel engines [147,169,180]. In fact, introducing
oxygenated additives with the high latent heat of vaporization into the
combustion chamber could lower the flame temperature, lowering the
combustion  temperature  [147,169,195].  The  oxygenated  additives

could also reduce the peak combustion temperature resulting from inlet
charge cooling [180,181]. However, it has been claimed in some reports
that  oxygenated  additives  could  increase  NOx  emissions  [179].  This
issue could be attributed to the inbuilt oxygen content of oxygenated
additives, which could enhance the combustion process and increase the
in-cylinder temperature [179].

-  Soot/smoke emissions

The quantity of soot emissions from the diesel engine depends on the
balance  between  soot  formation  and  oxidation  [275].  According  to
several studies, soot emissions could be suppressed by adding hydrogen
to  diesel  fuel  [115,272].  Hydrogen  could  well  homogenize  air-fuel
mixture, improving combustion efficiency and lowering soot emissions
[150]. Hydrogen addition to diesel fuel could decrease carbon content or
increase the H/C ratio of fuel, thus mitigating soot emissions [249]. By
reducing the amount of diesel fuel in the mixture, the oxidation of soot
could be promoted while the initial formation of soot is decreased [10].
Smoke is a visible product of combustion generated because of poor
combustion. The smoke formation reaction in internal combustion en-
gines is usually presented by the following equation [156]:

smoke formation.

Several studies have reported that hydrogen addition to diesel fuel
could reduce smoke emissions because of the carbon-free structure of
gaseous  hydrogen or the  high H/C  ratio of the air-fuel  mixture [124,
271]. In better words, hydrogen combustion produces water and does
not lead to smoke emissions [17]. The high diffusion of hydrogen could
also  improve  the  homogeneity  of  the  air-fuel  mixture  and  the  avail-
ability of oxygen, thereby reducing smoke emissions [186]. In addition,
the  turbulent  flame  generated  during  hydrogen  combustion  could
oxidize the carbon particles formed from diesel combustion [244]. The

premixed  charge  (hydrogen-air)  formation  in  the  dual-fuel  operation
mode could eliminate the cause of smoke emissions from diesel engines
[270].  However,  hyper-induction  of  hydrogen  could  increase  smoke
emissions by forming a rich air-fuel mixture [123].

Numerous studies have unanimously demonstrated that a substantial
reduction in soot/smoke emissions could be achieved using carbon-free
hydrogen  in  biodiesel-fueled  engines  [169,203,237].  The  decline  in
soot/smoke emissions could also be attributed to the fact that hydrogen
addition could reduce the share of biodiesel in the air-fuel mixture while
avoiding  localized  fuel-rich  pockets  [220].  As  revealed  through  nu-
merical  investigation,  increasing  the  hydrogen  inclusion  rate  to  bio-
diesel could further reduce soot emissions (Fig. 18). Generally, hydrogen
could  suppress  soot/smoke  formation  by  promoting  the  OH  radicals
formation while reducing the aromatic ring formation [47].

Hydrogen addition to biodiesel could improve the homogeneity of
the air-fuel mixture, resulting in enhanced combustion with fewer soot/
smoke  emissions  [206].  In  addition,  hydrogen  could  oxidize  the  un-
burned  soot  particles  in  the  combustion  chamber  of  biodiesel-fueled
engines  by  promoting  secondary  oxidation  reactions  [256].  Adding
hydrogen  to  biodiesel  could enhance  the  premixed  combustion phase
while reducing the combustion duration and the diffusion combustion
phase,  thus  lowering  soot/smoke  emissions  [204].  Unlike  the  above
arguments, some studies have claimed that hyper-induction of hydrogen
could increase the soot/smoke emissions from biodiesel-fueled engines
because of oxygen inadequacy within the combustion chamber [55,56].
Nanoadditives  could  reportedly  lower  the  soot/smoke  emissions
from hydrogen-fueled diesel engines because of their positive effect on
combustion  stability  [176].  Like  nanoadditives,  oxygenated  additives
could  cause  a  reduction
from
hydrogen-fueled  diesel  engines,  as  reported  in  several  investigations
[147,169,180].  This  result  could  be  because  of  the  structural  oxygen
content of oxygenated additives, contributing to the complete combus-
tion of carbon particles [147,169]. The lower C/H ratio of oxygenated
additives could also be another reason for the lower soot/smoke emis-
sion. The air-fuel mixture of hydrogen and oxygenated additives could
be more homogeneous and free from the liquid fraction of fuel pockets,
reducing soot/smoke emissions [180,181].

-  Particulate matter emissions

PM  comprises  the  carbonaceous  compounds  that  result  from  the
incomplete  combustion  of  hydrocarbon  fuel  [17].  PM  is  a  complex
pollutant  comprising  soluble  materials,  insoluble  materials,  and  dry
fractions [276,277]. Soot, which falls under the category of insoluble
materials, makes up a significant portion of PM (just over 50%) [276].
Unburned  hydrocarbons,  partially  burned  hydrocarbons,  unburned  or
partially burned lubricating oil, engine wear particles, and fuel-derived
sulfates comprise the rest of PM (approximately 50%) [276,278]. Most
soot  comprises  elemental  carbon,  which  adsorbs  organic  compounds
such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and their derivatives, sulfates,
nitrates, metals, or other trace elements [279]. Particles in PM are found
in  both  liquid  phase  and  agglomerate  solid  forms.  Most  liquid  phase
particles in PM are volatile organic fractions and sulfates sized between
5 and 50 nm. The main constituents of agglomerated particles are soot,
organic  components  (volatile  organic  fractions  or  nonvolatile  organic
fractions), metallic ashes, and SO4, with a size ranging from 50 to 500
nm  [280].  It  is  important  to  note  that  soot  agglomerates  are  mainly
formed  within  the  combustion  chamber,  whereas  complex  materials
(PM) are formed outside the combustion chamber [280].

PM  could  be  reduced  by  hydrogen  enrichment  because  of  the
absence of carbon in hydrogen and the reduction in the diesel fuel in-
jection rate [165]. Hydrogen addition to diesel fuel could increase the
flame temperature and enhance hydrocarbon combustion, inhibiting PM
formation [161]. Substituting diesel fuel with hydrogen could make the
air-fuel mixture more homogenous, leading to fewer fuel-rich pockets
and lower PM emissions. It should be noted that incomplete combustion

of  fuel-rich  pockets  frequently  near  injector  sprays  might  lead  to  the
formation of PM [198].

It has also been documented that adding hydrogen could reduce the
particle size and number concentration because of its inhibition effect on
the hydrogen abstraction and C2H2  addition mechanism [236]. More-
over, the agglomeration of more aggregate particles into bigger clusters
could  apparently  be  reduced  by  adding  hydrogen  to  ultra-low  sulfur
diesel, as shown by TEM images in Fig. 19 [281]. Hydrogen addition
could also modify the nanostructure of primary particles emitted from
the diesel engine. As indicated by typical HRTEM images in Fig. 20, a
change from the “turbostratic interlayer”  structure to the “onion-like”
structure could be observed by hydrogen addition to diesel fuel at engine
speeds of 1200 and 1800 rpm under 30% engine load. In addition, the
shell–core”  structure  could  be  modified  to  the  “shell-amorphous”  by
adding  hydrogen  to  diesel  fuel  at  1200  and  1800  rpm  under  70%  of
full-load operation.

Compression ignition diesel engines produce PM primarily because
of the heterogeneous combustion process caused by local fuel-rich zones
within the combustion chamber [170]. Hydrogen could lead to a more
homogeneous  air-fuel  mixture,  lowering  PM  emissions.  It  is  also
well-documented that hydrogen addition could mitigate the PM emis-
sions  from  biodiesel-fueled  engines  because  of  a  reduction  in
carbon-containing  biodiesel  in  the  air-fuel  mixture  [173,274,282].  In
addition, the product of hydrogen combustion is water, not PM [170].
The  oxygen  concentration  and  in-cylinder  temperature  are  the  main
parameters  affecting  PM  oxidation  in  compression  ignition  engines.
Accordingly, adding hydrogen to biodiesel could reduce PM emissions
because of the in-built oxygen of biodiesel and the high burning rate of
hydrogen [170]. Interestingly, adding hydrogen to biodiesel fuel could
change the nature of the PM generated from ordinarily black to more
gumming and colorless [283]. In general, additives could reduce the PM
emissions  from  hydrogen-fueled  diesel  engines.  The  higher  catalytic
activity  of  nanoadditives  could  boost  the  oxidation  reactions  while
reducing  PM  formation.  The  in-built  oxygen  content  of  oxygenated

the air-fuel mixture because of the high mass diffusivity and flame speed
of  hydrogen  [285].  Based  on  the  findings  of  several  investigations,
hydrogen enrichment could promote the methane combustion process in
diesel engines while improving their BTE values [284,287]. This result
could  be  ascribed  to  more  efficient  expansion  work  caused  by  the
increased  laminar  flame  speed  of  the  mixture  [284].  However,  it  has
been reported in some studies that adding hydrogen to methane could
not positively affect the BTE of diesel engines because of higher heat
losses resulting from the low flame rate of methane [288]. According to
the findings of various studies, incorporating hydrogen into CNG could
positively affect the BTE of diesel engines [289–291]. In fact, hydrogen
could  effectively  compensate  for  the  low  flame  speed  of  CNG  while
improving  its  combustion  [292].  The  fast  burning  rate  of  hydrogen
could  extend  the  lean  burn  limit,  thereby  reducing  losses  at  higher
combustion  temperatures  and  heat  transfer  rates  [290].  The  higher
hydrogen  diffusivity  could  also  homogenize  the  air-fuel  mixture  and
improve the BTE of diesel engines [289]. The higher calorific value of
hydrogen could be mentioned as another main reason for this finding.
Adding  hydrogen  to  NG  could  favorably  impact  the  BTE  of  diesel
engines by improving NG combustion because of the increased laminar
flame speed of the mixture [293]. The higher mass energy of hydrogen
and its lower density could also increase the BTE of diesel engines [246].
It has also been documented that fortifying LPG with hydrogen could
positively enhance the BTE of diesel engines by making the flame of LPG
stable at lean gaseous fuel-air mixtures [294,295]. Notably, the flame
and combustion of LPG are unstable because of its low cetane number
and narrow flammability limit [294]. According to some studies, adding
hydrogen to LPG could have different effects on the BTE of diesel en-
gines under various engine load conditions [295]. At lower engine load
conditions, adding more hydrogen to LPG could not improve the BTE of
diesel engines because of the increased heat loss rate. Unlike pure diesel
operation, the combustion process is not confined to the piston chamber
(bowl)  alone  when  diesel  engines  are  fueled  with  hydrogen-enriched
LPG  [295].  Therefore,  more  heat  is  transferred  to  the  cylinder  walls,
lowering engine thermal efficiency [295]. It should also be noted that
the combustion zone of pure diesel operation is surrounded by air, acting
as a semi-insulator between the combusted gases and the cylinder walls
while lowering the heat loss rate [295]. However, incorporating more
hydrogen into LPG could stabilize flame at higher engine load conditions
because of increased Markstein length [295]. In better words, hydrogen
could  compensate  for  the  lower  diffusivity  of  LPG  in  the  air  and  its
narrower flammability limits [296]. The diffusivity of hydrogen and LPG
in the air is 0.61 vs. 0.12 cm2/s, respectively.

Reportedly,  adding  hydrogen  to  biogas  could  favorably  affect  the
BSFC of diesel engines because of complete combustion resulting from
the higher flame velocity of hydrogen [286]. It has been documented
that enriching methane with hydrogen could decrease the BSFC of diesel
engines  because  of  the  more  efficient  burning  of  the  air-fuel  mixture
[297]. It should also be noted that methane could compensate for some
drawbacks of hydrogen combustion (e.g., low quenching distance), thus
avoiding the deterioration of thermal efficiency and BSFC of diesel en-
gines  [297].  Unlike  the  above  arguments,  it  has  been  found  in  some
studies that adding hydrogen to methane could not positively influence
the BSFC of diesel engines [298]. This issue could be attributed to the
higher thermal loss because of the increased wall heat flux of hydrogen
flame,  particularly  at  lower  engine  load  conditions  (lower  wall  tem-
peratures)  [298].  Enriching  CNG  with  hydrogen  could  decrease  the
BSFC  of  diesel  engines  because  of  hydrogen’s  higher  calorific  value
[289,299].  However,  it  has  been  found  in  some  studies  that  adding
hydrogen to CNG could not effectively decrease the BSFC of diesel en-
gines because of a reduction in their volumetric efficiency resulting from
the  lower  volumetric  heat  value  of  hydrogen  [300].  Incorporating
hydrogen into NG could favorably decrease the BSFC of diesel engines
by improving gaseous fuel combustion [293]. It has been reported that
enriching methane and NG with hydrogen could favorably reduce the
BSEC of diesel engines owing  to the  better utilization of gaseous fuel

additives could cause a better combustion process, leading to reduced
PM emissions [146].

5. Use of hydrogen in gaseous-fueled diesel engines

Using gaseous fuels (e.g., biogas, methane, CNG, NG, and LPG) is a
promising  strategy  for  meeting  strict  emission  regulations  in  internal
combustion engines [284]. Compared with liquid fuels, these alternative
fuels have wider burning limits and higher hydrogen-to-carbon ratios,
resulting in homogenized air-fuel mixtures [284]. Despite the potential
economic and environmental advantages of using these gaseous fuels in
diesel  engines,  some  challenging  issues,  like  engine  performance  and
durability,  should  be  resolved  before  commercial  application  [285].
Enriching gaseous fuels with hydrogen could significantly enhance the
combustion  of  biogas,  methane,  CNG,  NG,  and  LPG  while  addressing
their  associated  problems  in  diesel  engines.  The  effects  of  various
gaseous  fuels  on  the  combustion  and  performance  characteristics  of
hydrogen-fueled  diesel  engines  are  tabulated  in  Table  S7.  Table  S8
summarizes the effects of enriching gaseous fuels with hydrogen on the
exhaust emissions from diesel engines.

5.1. Performance indicators

-  Brake thermal efficiency and brake specific fuel/energy consumption

Enriching  biogas  with  hydrogen  could  improve  the  BTE  of  diesel
engines by compensating for the lower calorific value of CO2-rich biogas
and  improving  its  combustion  efficiency  [285,286].  The  biogas  com-
bustion process could also be enhanced by reducing the heterogeneity of

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience98(2023)10110021

S.H. Hosseini et al.

[284,293].  Increasing  the  laminar  flame  speed  of  the  mixture  in
response  to  the  hydrogen  addition  could  also  lead  to  more  efficient
expansion work [284].

5.2. Combustion parameters

-  In-cylinder pressure

Adding hydrogen to biogas could increase the in-cylinder pressure of
diesel engines due to partially replacing the inherent CO2 of biogas with
hydrogen [285,301,302]. The better ignitability, higher calorific value,
and higher flame propagation speed of hydrogen could promote biogas
combustion  while  increasing  in-cylinder  pressure  [301].  Hydrogen
addition could also reduce the air/fuel ratio and complete the combus-
tion  process,  resulting  in  greater  peak  pressure  near  TDC  [285,302].
Enriching methane with hydrogen could cause a sudden increase in the
in-cylinder pressure of diesel engines [288,298,303]. The faster flame
speed and higher specific energy of hydrogen compared with methane
could  improve  flame  propagation  in  the  premixed  gaseous  air-fuel
mixture  while  increasing  the  heat  release  rate  and  in-cylinder  pres-
sure.  Similarly,  incorporating  hydrogen  into  CNG  could  increase  the
in-cylinder  pressure  of  diesel  engines  [291,300,304,305].  Hydrogen
could  result  in  better-premixed  charged  combustion  characteristics
since  its  higher  diffusivity  in  the  air  than  CNG  could  lead  to  a  more
homogeneous  gaseous  fuel  charge  within  the  combustion  chamber
before the start of combustion [304]. The low ignition energy and high
burning speed of hydrogen could also improve the flame speed of the
gaseous
fuel  mixture,  causing  more  simultaneous  combustion
throughout the cylinder [304].

In  addition,  hydrogen  could  promote  the  production  of  hydroxyl
radicals and enhance the reactivity of the gaseous fuel mixture [304].
These issues could cause higher peak pressures and heat release rates
[304]. Hydrogen addition to NG could increase the in-cylinder pressure
of diesel engines because of the enhanced heat release rate [246,293].
The  improvement  could  occur  in  gaseous  fuel  combustion  because
adding  hydrogen  to  NG could  elevate the  pressure  peak and  close  its
occurrence to the top dead center. Like the above-listed investigations,
enriching LPG with hydrogen could increase the in-cylinder pressure of
diesel engines [294,295]. Hydrogen could improve the evaporation rate
of  LPG  and  shorten  ignition  delay,  promoting  the  combustion  of  the
air-fuel mixture and resulting in higher in-cylinder pressure [294,295].

-  Heat release rate

Incorporating hydrogen into biogas could increase the heat release
rate of diesel engines [27,301]. The higher calorific value and laminar
flame  speed  of  hydrogen  could  advance  and  increase  the  peak  heat
release rate of both premixed and diffusion combustion phases because
of  an  improvement  in  combustion  [301].  It  has  been  reported  that
enhancing methane with hydrogen could increase the heat release rate
of diesel engines [303]. Hydrogen could compensate for the lower flame
propagation speed of methane, thus increasing the in-cylinder pressure
and heat release rate [303]. The higher flame speed of hydrogen could
cause the domination of the premixed combustion phase. Accordingly,
the  energy  released  in  the  premixed  combustion  phase  could  be
the
increased  at
mixing-controlled  combustion  phase  [298].  These  changes  could
collectively increase the heat release rate of diesel engines. Unlike the
above  discussions,  it  has  been  found  in  some  studies  that  hydrogen
addition to methane could lower the peak heat release rate because of a
decrease in the volumetric heating value of the mixture [284,297]. Even
though  hydrogen  has  a  higher  mass  heating  value  than  methane,  its
volumetric  heating  value  is  lower  than  methane  [297].  Furthermore,
increasing  hydrogen  supplementation  rates  could  further  dilute  the
mixture because of an increased excess air ratio, thus lowering the heat
release rate [284].

the  expense  of  reduced  energy  release

in

Hydrogen enrichment could increase the heat release rate of CNG-
fueled diesel engines [290,291,300,304]. The high flame velocity and
fast  burning  of  hydrogen  could  increase  the  burning  velocity  of  the
air-fuel mixture while making the peak heat release rate close to the top
dead center [300]. This unique property of hydrogen could also accel-
erate  the  ignition  of  the  fuel  far  away  from  the  ignition  point  while
resulting  in  simultaneous  combustion  throughout  the  cylinder.  The
higher diffusivity of hydrogen compared to CNG can result in the for-
mation  of  a  more  uniformly  mixed  gaseous  fuel  charge  within  the
combustion  chamber  before  combustion  begins.  Accordingly,  adding
hydrogen to CNG and increasing its supplementation ratio could cause
better premixed charged combustion characteristics, increasing the heat
release  rate  [304].  Hydrogen  could  accelerate  CNG  combustion  by
improving its reactivity by producing hydroxyl radicals [304]. Similarly,
enriching  NG  with  hydrogen  could  increase  the  heat  release  rate  of
diesel engines because of an improvement in gaseous fuel combustion
[246,293]. Hydrogen addition to NG could also improve the ignition of
the fuel-air mixture and the consequent initial flame kernel establish-
ment [246]. The higher hydrogen diffusivity in the air could lead to a
more  homogeneous  and  ignitable  gaseous  charge,  providing  a  better
gaseous fuel premixed combustion and enhancing the heat release rate
[293].

-  Ignition delay

Hydrogen addition to biogas could result in prolonged ignition de-
lays in diesel engines because of a reduction in the oxygen concentration
of  the  intake  charge  [27].  The  lower  volumetric  energy  of  hydrogen
could  also  result  in  a  greater  displacement  of  engine  intake  air  than
methane [27]. Adding hydrogen to methane could decrease the ignition
delay of diesel engines [297,303]. The rapid oxidation (OH + H2 ↔ O +
H2O) and fast branching (H + O2 ↔ O + OH) of hydrogen molecules at
higher  temperatures  lead  to  the  production  and  consumption  of  OH
radicals, which are the main reasons for promoting the stronger ignition
effect. The auto-ignition mechanism and pre-ignition reactions by hot
spot surfaces upon including hydrogen might also contribute to earlier
ignition  in  internal  combustion  engines  [297].  Enriching  CNG  with
hydrogen could shorten the ignition delay of diesel engines because of
the higher burning velocity of hydrogen than CNG [290,291,304]. The
specific  heat  capacity  of  hydrogen  is  lower  than  methane  and  air.
Accordingly, the temperature rise of the combustion chamber could be
more  pronounced  by  enriching  CNG  with  hydrogen.  The  higher
in-cylinder  temperature  could  then  result  in  a  shorter  ignition  delay
[304]. Similarly, hydrogen addition to LPG could decrease the ignition
delay of diesel engines because of the promoted combustion process and
in-cylinder  pressure  [294,295].  Unlike  the  arguments
elevated
mentioned above, hydrogen addition to NG could not significantly affect
the ignition delay of diesel engines [293]. It has been claimed that the
pilot  fuel  properties  and  the  oxygen  concentration  in  the  in-cylinder
charge could play a prominent role in the ignition delay of diesel en-
gines, not gaseous fuel characteristics [293].

-  Combustion duration

Hydrogen  addition  could  prolong  the  combustion  duration  of
methane-fueled diesel engines [297]. This issue could be attributed to
the higher combustion speed and broader flammable limits of hydrogen
[297].  Reportedly,  enriching  CNG  with  hydrogen  could  shorten  the
combustion duration of diesel engines [290,291]. The main reasons for
this  finding  could  be  the  higher  flame  velocity,  higher  mass  calorific
value,  and  faster  burning  rate  of  hydrogen  [290,291].  Unlike  CNG,
hydrogen-enriched NG could increase the combustion duration of diesel
engines  [293].  Even  though  hydrogen  could  reduce  the  combustion
duration of the gaseous fuel combustion phase, it could not clearly affect
the  overall  combustion  duration  because  of  the  involvement  of  other
combustion  phases  [293].  In  addition,  hydrogen  could  shorten  the

combustion  duration  of  LPG-fueled  diesel  engines  [294].  Adding
hydrogen to LPG could cause a reduction in the quantity of the injected
liquid  fuel.  This  change  could  lead  to  shortened  pilot  fuel  injection
duration  and  shortened  combustion  duration  (e.g.,  reduced  diffusion
combustion phase) [294].

5.3. Exhaust emissions

-  Carbon monoxide emissions

Reportedly,  incorporating  hydrogen  into  biogas  could  effectively
mitigate  the  CO  emissions  from  diesel  engines  because  of  improved
combustion [28,286,301]. The carbon-free hydrogen could intensify the
burning  process  and  complete  the  oxidation  reactions  thanks  to  its
higher turbulent burning velocity, lowering the CO emissions from the
biogas-fueled  diesel  engines  [285,301].  In  addition,  hydrogen  could
effectively  neutralize  the  adverse  effects  of  CO2  in  biogas  on  the
oxidation  reactions  and  the  combustion  process  termination  before
completion  [28].  It  has  been  reported  that  enriching  methane  with
hydrogen  could  lower  the  CO  emissions  from  diesel  engines  [303].
Hydrogen  could  compensate  for  the  relatively  slow  flame  speed  of
methane, resulting in incomplete combustion and more CO formation
[303]. Hydrogen could markedly broaden the flammability of methane
while effectively alleviating its flame quenching [298,303]. The higher
diffusion coefficient of hydrogen could increase the homogeneity of the
air-fuel mixture [298]. Hydrogen could also accelerate some essential

oxidation reactions and improve the methane-lean combustion stability
by increasing the concentration of OH, H, and O radicals, thus mitigating
CO  emissions  [303].  Despite  the  above  arguments,  it  has  been  docu-
mented that hydrogen addition to methane could not effectively reduce
the  CO  emissions  from  diesel  engines  [288].  This  finding  could  be
attributed
lower
flame-spreading speed of methane [288].

the  narrower  flammability

limits  and

to

The CO emissions from diesel engines could be significantly reduced
when enriching CNG with hydrogen [291,299,305]. The main reason for
this finding could be substituting the carbon content of diesel and CNG
with hydrogen [305]. Increasing the hydrogen content in gaseous fuel
could  compensate  for  the  lower  flammability  limits  of  CNG  while
completing the combustion process due to better fuel mixing with air, as
portrayed in Fig. 21 [292,305]. Hydrogen addition to CNG could elevate
the  in-cylinder  temperature,  thus  facilitating  better  combustion  and
reducing CO emissions [290]. Like CNG, incorporating hydrogen into
NG could lower the CO emissions from diesel engines due to replacing
carbon-rich fuel with hydrogen fuel [306]. The higher burning rate of
hydrogen could also improve the NG utilization efficiency while causing
a reduction in CO emissions [246]. The CO emissions from diesel en-
gines could be mitigated by including hydrogen in LPG [296]. Adding
hydrogen  to  LPG  could  increase  the  H/C  ratio  of  the  mixture  while
improving the homogeneity of the air-fuel mixture because of the higher
mass  diffusivity  of  hydrogen.  These,  in  turn,  could  elevate  the
in-cylinder  temperature  and  enhance  the  LPG  combustion  efficiency
[294].

-  Carbon dioxide emissions

Adding hydrogen to biogas could decrease the CO2  emissions from
diesel  engines  by  substituting  a  portion  of  hydrocarbon  fuels  with
carbon-free hydrogen [28,286,302]. Adding hydrogen to biogas could
reduce the quantity of CO2 inflowed into the combustion chamber, thus
lowering the exhaust CO2 emissions [27]. The CO2 emissions from diesel
engines could be reduced by adding hydrogen to methane [297]. This
result could be because of decreased C/H ratio of the gaseous mixtures
[297]. Like methane, enriching CNG with carbon-free hydrogen could
lower  the  CO2  emissions  from  diesel  engines  [305].  In  addition,
increasing the hydrogen supplementation rate could suppress CO2  for-
mation, as illustrated in Fig. 22 [305]. Incorporating hydrogen into NG
could  decrease  the  CO2  emissions  from  diesel  engines  because  of  the
arguments mentioned above [306].

-  Unburned hydrocarbon emissions

Adding  hydrogen  to  biogas  could  significantly  lower  the  UHC
emissions from diesel engines [28,286,301]. Hydrogen could effectively
compensate  for  the  lower  combustion  temperature,  higher  ignition
delay,  lower  flame  speed, and  faster flame  quenching  of biogas  [28].
Accordingly,  the  flame  could  reach  the  end-gas  mixture  sufficiently
while  effectively  accelerating  the  oxidation  of  hydrocarbons  in  the
premixed  mixture  (air  and  biogas)  near  the  cylinder  walls  [28].  The
higher hydrogen diffusivity could also ensure a homogeneous distribu-
tion  of  fuel-rich  mixtures  within  the  combustion  chamber,  rendering
higher  combustion  temperatures  [28].  In  addition,  hydrogen  could
appropriately  neutralize  the  adverse  combustion  effects  of  CO2  in
biogas. It should be noted that the structural CO2 of biogas could lower
the  in-cylinder  temperature by absorbing  heat, thereby inhibiting the
hydrocarbon oxidation process [302]. Hence, proper combustion could
occur  within  the  chamber,  reducing  UHC  emissions  [286].  The  UHC
emissions  from  diesel  engines  could  be  mitigated  by  incorporating
hydrogen into methane [288,298]. Hydrogen could alleviate the main
drawbacks of using methane in diesel engines, i.e., flame quenching and
unburned or partially burned methane because of the local misfire [288,
298]. Hydrogen could also deal with the flame quenching of methane,

allowing  the  flame  to  reach  the  vicinity  of  the  wall  and  enabling
oxidation of the  unburned methane trapped in  crevice and squish  re-
gions [297].

Reportedly, hydrogen enrichment of CNG could positively affect the
UHC emissions from diesel engines because of an improvement in the
gaseous fuel burning rate [290,291,299]. Hydrogen could increase the
H/C ratio of the air-CNG mixture, drastically mitigating carbon-based
emissions.  The  higher  flame  velocity  and  flame  temperature  of
hydrogen  could  improve  CNG  combustion  and  lower  UHC  emissions
[291]. Like CNG, hydrogen enrichment could significantly reduce the
UHC emissions from NG-fueled diesel engines [306]. Hydrogen could
cope  with  the  crevice  effect  of  CNG  thanks  to  its  higher  flame  speed
while promoting the oxidation of CNG. Notably, the crevice effect refers
to the entrapment of a portion of a nearly homogeneous air-fuel mixture
in  the  gaps  within  the  combustion  chamber  [306].  Various  loading
conditions  could  also  affect  the  UHC  emissions  from  diesel  engines
fueled  with  hydrogen-enriched  NG  [246].  At  lower  engine  loading
conditions, adding hydrogen to NG could not positively affect the UHC
emissions  from  diesel  engines  because  of  the  formation  of  very  lean
hydrogen-air and NG-air mixtures. However, the combustion stability
and efficiency could be improved under higher engine loading condi-
tions because of the increased fuel-air ratio and in-cylinder temperature
[246]. This issue, in turn, could lead to the complete combustion of the
fuel-air  mixture  and  reduce  the  total  UHC  emission  levels.  Enriching
LPG with hydrogen could lower the UHC emissions from diesel engines
by increasing the H/C ratio of the fuel blend, enhancing the homoge-
neity of the air-fuel mixture, and increasing the combustion temperature
[294].

-  Nitrogen oxide emissions

Adding  hydrogen  to  biogas  could  negatively  increase  the  NOx
emissions  from  diesel  engines  [28,285,301,302].  In  general,  fueling
diesel engines with biogas could lower their NOx emissions due to the
inert CO2 present in biogas. CO2, with a high specific heat capacity, can
absorb thermal energy during combustion. As a result, it can reduce the
temperature at the beginning of combustion and the peak temperature.
In addition, a portion of intake oxygen could be replaced with biogas,

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience98(2023)10110024

particularly in the case of manifold injection, decreasing oxygen con-
centration in the air-fuel mixture because of a decrease in volumetric
efficiency [28,302]. However, incorporating hydrogen into biogas could
increase the heat release rate during the premixed combustion phase,
leading to higher peak temperatures. Hydrogen addition to biogas could
also lower the biogas contribution to the fuel mixture while enhancing
the overall quality of combustible gases introduced into the combustion
chamber. These issues, in turn, could increase NOx formation within the
combustion chamber [28].

Enriching methane with hydrogen could increase the NOx emissions
from diesel engines [288,297,303]. Hydrogen could increase the peak
in-cylinder temperature and pressure of methane-fueled diesel engines
because of its higher mass energy and flame propagation speed [288,
298]. Increasing the hydrogen share in the gaseous fuel mixture could
negatively increase NO formation in diesel engines because of a drastic
increase in the peak in-cylinder temperature and pressure, as indicated
in Fig. 23 [303]. Unlike the arguments mentioned above, it has been
reported  that  adding  a  small  amount  of  hydrogen  to  methane  could
favorably decrease NOx emissions [287].

Several investigations have found that adding hydrogen to CNG and
NG could increase the NOx emissions from diesel engines [289,299,305,
306]. This result could be due to higher cylinder temperature and faster
burning rate of hydrogen compared with CNG and NG [299]. Increasing
the fraction of hydrogen in the gaseous fuel could negatively increase
NO  formation  within  the  combustion chamber  because of  a  sharp  in-
crease in combustion temperature, as shown in Fig. 24 [305]. Notably,
NOx  formation  increases  exponentially  with  increasing  temperature,
◦
with a doubling of NOx formation occurring for every 90
C temperature
◦
rise above approximately 1930
C [306]. Unlike biogas, methane, CNG,
and  NG,  adding  hydrogen  to  LPG  could  favorably  decrease  the  NOx
emissions from diesel engines [295,296]. Adding hydrogen could make
temperature  distribution  uniform  within  the  combustion  chamber,
causing a  reduction in the  high-temperature  region around the diesel
flame [295]. Adding hydrogen to LPG could reduce the amount of pilot
diesel fuel injected into the combustion during the diffusion-controlled
combustion  phase  [296].  Notably,  most  NOx  formation  in  diesel  en-
gines occurs in the diffusion combustion phase and on the weak side of
the reaction zone.

-  Soot/smoke emissions

Enriching  biogas  with  hydrogen  could  cause  a  reduction  in  the
smoke  emissions  from  diesel  engines  [28].  Enriching  diesel  fuel  with
lighter  gaseous  fuel  like  hydrogen  can  create  a  homogenous  air-fuel
mixture  with  a  lower  C/H  ratio  [28].  These  changes  could  promote
the  combustion  of  soot  particles,  causing  a  significant  reduction  in
smoke emissions [28]. Adding carbon-free hydrogen to methane could

effectively mitigate the smoke emissions from diesel engines [288,298].
The  higher  diffusion  coefficient  of  hydrogen  could  cause  a
well-homogenized  combustible  mixture,  resulting  in  enhanced  com-
bustion  efficiency  and  lowered  smoke  emissions  [298].  However,  it
should  be  noted  that  the  reduction  in  smoke  emissions  obtained  by
hydrogen addition to biogas at lower engine loads could be more pro-
nounced than at higher engine loads. This result could be because of an
increase in the injected pilot diesel fuel quantity and a decrease in the
lambda value [297].

Similarly,  hydrogen  could  decrease  the  smoke  and  soot  emissions
from CNG-fueled diesel engines [290,291,299]. The reduction in smoke
emissions could be notable by incorporating more hydrogen into CNG
because of its carbon-free and clean-burning characteristics [299]. The
higher burning velocity and flame temperature of hydrogen could lead
to better oxidization of hydrocarbons during combustion [291]. Diesel
engines  fueled  with  hydrogen-enriched  CNG  could  generate  signifi-
cantly  lower  smoke  and  soot  than  straight  diesel-powered  ones.  The
shortened  ignition  delay  of  straight  diesel  resulting  from  its  lower
self-ignition temperature and higher cetane number could not provide
sufficient time for the fuel to form a homogenous mixture, generating
higher amounts of soot [289]. Hydrogen could effectively cope with the
drawbacks  of  straight  diesel  fuel  while  lowering  its  soot  emission.
Incorporating hydrogen into LPG could lower the smoke emissions from
diesel engines due to improved air-fuel mixing [296]. Therefore, a sig-
nificant  portion  of  the  injected  pilot  fuel  could  be  combusted  in  the
homogeneous  environment
in  the  diffusion  combustion  phase,
rendering combustion clean and smoke-free [296].

-  Particulate matter emissions

Hydrogen  enrichment  could  substantially  lower  the  PM  emissions
from  biogas-fueled  diesel  engines  [27].  Hydrogen  addition  to  biogas
could effectively tackle the cooling effect of the inherent CO2 of biogas,
leading  to  reduced  PM  emissions  by  elevating  post-combustion  gas
temperature  [27].  In  addition,  substituting  a  portion  of  the  biogas
comprising CH4  and CO2  could reduce fuel carbon introduced into the
combustion  chamber.  Similarly,  adding  carbon-free hydrogen  to  CNG
and NG could lower the PM emissions from diesel engines because of the
formation of a homogeneous air-fuel mixture with an excellent burning
rate [246,307].

6. Use of hydrogen with inert gas in diesel engines

Although using hydrogen in diesel engines could lower CO, UHC, and
soot emissions, it could negatively increase NOx emissions by increasing
combustion  chamber  temperature.  In  addition,  hydrogen  could  cause
premature/undesired ignition problems in diesel engines because of the

formation of hot gases and hot spots within the cylinder. These chal-
lenging issues could be curbed by diluting the charge using inert gases
(e.g., helium and nitrogen) while maintaining combustion temperature
at a proper level [139,308]. Diluents do not take apart chemically (as
fuel or oxidant) in the combustion process and do not positively affect
the total energy released. They act as a thermal sink because of having
higher heat capacity values while limiting the temperature rise in the
combustion process. Diluents can significantly affect the molecular ac-
tivities during the combustion process, thus preventing the rapid pres-
sure rise and damping the knocking tendency [139]. Table S9 tabulates
the effects of inert gases on the combustion and performance charac-
teristics of hydrogen-fueled diesel engines.

6.1. Performance indicators

Adding nitrogen to hydrogen up to a certain concentration (30% by
volume) could improve the overall thermal efficiency and increase the
knock-limited  power  output  of  diesel  engines  [309].  However,  it  has
been found in some studies that the use of inert gases could lead to a
decrease in the BTE of hydrogen-fueled diesel engines [139,309,310].
Adding nitrogen to hydrogen could dilute the intake charge and cause
partial  oxidation  of  the  pilot  diesel  fuel  [310].  In  addition,  nitrogen
could  lead  to  the  incomplete  combustion  of  hydrogen,  which  could
negatively affect thermal efficiency [310]. Despite the favorable effects
of nitrogen on controlling the combustion pressure and temperature rise,
it could lower thermal efficiency by absorbing a considerable amount of
thermal  energy  from  the  fuel  charge  [139,309].  Adding  nitrogen  to
hydrogen could decrease the air available in the main combustion zone,
causing incomplete combustion. Nitrogen could also shift the combus-
tion process to the expansion stroke, lowering thermal efficiency [309].
It should be noted that nitrogen is advantageous over helium because of
its comparatively larger heat capacity value, allowing better control of
the in-cylinder temperature/pressure rises and the heat release rate in

diesel engines [309]. The effect of inert gas on the BSFC/BSEC of diesel
has not been investigated in the published literature. Nevertheless, ni-
trogen  could  improve  the  indicated  specific  energy  consumption  of
diesel engines [308]. Nitrogen could improve the homogeneity of the
air-fuel  mixture  while  decreasing  fuel-rich  zones.  This  issue  could
enhance the oxidation process of fuel within the combustion chamber
[308].

6.2. Combustion parameters

Substituting a portion of hydrogen with nitrogen could decrease the
peak in-cylinder temperature and the heat release rate of diesel engines
[308]. This result could be attributed  to the reduction in the air/fuel
ratio and the slower oxidation rate of diesel fuel. Diluting nitrogen with
hydrogen  could  shorten  the  combustion  duration  of  diesel  engines
[139].  The  higher  energy  supplied  by  hydrogen  because  of  nitrogen
dilution  could  increase  the  in-cylinder  temperature,  thus  shortening
combustion duration. Diluents like nitrogen could effectively lower the
pressure  rise  rate  of  hydrogen-fueled  diesel  engines  and  control  their
knock [139]. These inert gases could cool down the combustion cham-
ber by absorbing a significant amount of the combustion heat of the fuel
charge,  allowing  more  hydrogen  to  be  inducted  into  the  combustion
chamber [139]. Incorporating nitrogen into hydrogen could prolong the
ignition  delay  of  diesel  engines  by  lowering  bulk  gas  temperatures
[139].

6.3. Exhaust emissions

The effects of diluent gases on the exhaust emissions from hydrogen-
fueled diesel engines are tabled in Table S10. Diluting hydrogen with
nitrogen  could  lead  to  increased  CO  emissions  from  diesel  engines
because of reduced oxygen concentration inside the cylinder [139,308].
This  result  could  also  be  attributed  to  the  cooling  effect  of  nitrogen.

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience98(2023)10110026

S.H. Hosseini et al.

Hydrogen dilution with nitrogen at lower levels (40–50% V/V) could not
markedly  increase  the  UHC  emissions  from  diesel  engines.  However,
increasing the dilution rate to 60% V/V could significantly increase UHC
emissions because of the negative effect of nitrogen on the combustion
chamber temperature [139]. Several investigations have reported that
diluting hydrogen with inert gases, such as nitrogen and helium, could
effectively  mitigate  the  NOx  emissions  from  diesel  engines  [138,139,
308,310]. The presence of inert gases can lower the peak temperature
within  the  cylinder  by  absorbing  a  significant  portion  of  the  heat
generated during combustion and reducing the flame propagation rate.
These diluents could also reduce the oxygen concentration within the
combustion chamber, thus suppressing NOx formation [138]. It should
be noted that nitrogen might promote NOx formation at lower induction
rates by participating in combustion. However, increasing the nitrogen
induction  rate  could  further  reduce  NOx  emissions  by  lowering  peak
in-cylinder temperature [308]. Reportedly, the simultaneous addition of
hydrogen and nitrogen to diesel fuel could mitigate both soot and NOx
emissions (Fig. 25) [308]. As shown in Fig. 25, soot and NOx could be
located on both sides of the flame front for straight diesel. Incorporating
hydrogen  into  diesel  fuel  could  increase  the  in-cylinder  temperature
while  increasing  NOx  formation.  However,  adding  nitrogen  to  diesel
fuel could lower the combustion chamber temperature while increasing
soot emission. In general, the simultaneous addition of hydrogen and
nitrogen could effectively control both air-fuel mixing and combustion
processes and significantly reduce soot and NOx emissions [308]. It has
also been observed that improving combustion efficiency in response to
incorporating hydrogen and nitrogen into diesel fuel could lower smoke
formation [138].

7. Use of hydroxy gas in diesel engines with/without additive-
doped or gaseous fuels

Using  hydrogen  in  internal  combustion  engines  is  challenging
because  of  its  instability  and  highly  explosive  nature  [311].  In-place
hydrogen  production  using  water  electrolysis  is  a  promising  solution
to  this  issue.  Water  electrolysis  produces  a  gas  mixture  containing
hydrogen and oxygen in nearly stoichiometric proportions, called HHO
[312]. The hydrogen and oxygen produced in water electrolysis could
not be separated because they remain in their mono-atomic state (or do
not  form  diatomic  O2  and  H2  molecules)  [313,314].  Because  of  the
unique features of HHO gas, various researchers have investigated the
effect of HHO addition on the combustion and performance character-
istics of diesel engines fueled with diesel/biodiesel blends (Table S11).
Using oxygenated additives in diesel engines could lead to a reduc-
tion in exhaust emissions. However, there could be a reduction in the
generated power of diesel engines upon the inclusion rate of low-energy
oxygenated  additives.  HHO  enrichment  could  be  a  viable  option  to
improve  the  performance  of  diesel  engines  by  maintaining  exhaust
emissions as low as possible [315]. In addition, CNG, as a cost-effective
fuel, is usually inducted into the air during the induction stroke. CNG
could negatively affect the efficiency of diesel engines while increasing
CO and UHC emissions [316]. HHO gas could effectively cope with the
adverse effects of CNG addition on diesel engine performance parame-
ters  and  exhaust  emissions.  In  line  with  this,  some  studies  have
attempted to assess the effect of HHO on the performance parameters of
diesel  engines  powered  by  oxygenated  additives/CNG  (Table  S12).  It
should be noted that the effect of HHO on the combustion parameters of
diesel  engines  powered  by  oxygenated  additives/CNG  has  not  been
investigated in the published literature.

7.1. Performance indicators

-  Brake thermal efficiency and brake specific fuel/energy consumption

It has been reported in several studies that HHO could improve the

BTE of diesel/biodiesel fuel due to the increased calorific value of the
overall  mixture  in  the  combustion  chamber  [314,317–319].  This  gas
could also enhance the combustion rate of diesel/biodiesel fuel because
of its favorable thermodynamic and transport properties, increasing the
average cycle temperature and brake mean effective pressure [320,321].
The higher diffusivity, wider flammability limit, better mixing charac-
teristics, and higher auto-ignition temperature of HHO gas (because of
its hydrogen content) could allow the engine to operate at leaner mix-
tures while improving BTE [317,321]. The higher energetic content of
monoatomic  hydrogen  compared  with  its  diatomic  counterpart  could
also  speed  up  the  cleavage  of  the  heavier  hydrocarbon  molecules  of
diesel fuel while promoting the chain reaction and resulting in efficient
combustion [322]. The hydrogen content of HHO could also compensate
for  the  lower  energetic  content  of  biodiesel.  In  addition,  the  oxygen
content of HHO could complete the combustion of the charge introduced
to the combustion chamber and enhance combustion efficiency [323].
Interestingly, HHO could be more effective than hydrogen in improving
the  BTE  of  diesel/biodiesel  blends  because  of  the  increased  oxygen
fraction of the intake air [194]. Unlike the arguments mentioned above,
it has been observed in some investigations that HHO could lower the
BTE of diesel fuel because of excess fuel and oxygen shortage [322,324].
It has been reported that adding HHO to diesel/biodiesel/kerosene
blends could improve the BTE of diesel engines by compensating for the
lower  calorific  value  of  biodiesel  [318].  In  addition,  the  BTE  of
CNG-fueled diesel engines could be enhanced by adding HHO gas [325].
The  increased  diffusion  and  flame  speed  of  hydrogen  found  in  HHO
could enhance the uniformity of the air-CNG mixture. The wider flam-
mability of hydrogen present in HHO could also ensure complete com-
bustion  of  the  air-CNG  mixture.  The  higher  oxygen  concentration  of
HHO  could  complete  the  combustion  process  while  improving  the
thermal efficiency of diesel engines [325].

Reportedly, HHO addition could reduce the BSFC of diesel/biodiesel
fuel because of the higher energetic content of monoatomic hydrogen
[318,326,327]. The higher chemical reactivity of monoatomic hydrogen
could also accelerate the chain reactions after diesel/biodiesel ignition
and result in higher combustion efficiency [320]. The higher diffusivity
of  HHO  could  cause  a  uniform  air-fuel  mixture  while  yielding  better
combustion and lowering fuel consumption. The low ignition energy of
the  hydroxyl-air  mixture  could  improve  diesel/biodiesel  fuel  burning
even  under  leaner  conditions  [313,314,328].  HHO  addition  could
intensify the charge temperature and increase the oxidation rate of fuel.
Furthermore, the combination of HHO and biodiesel could warrant more
oxygen  supply,  prompting  complete  combustion  [319].  Furthermore,
HHO addition to diesel/biodiesel could decrease BSEC because of the
same reasons for BSFC [194,321].

Unlike the above discussions, it has been found that HHO addition
could increase the BSFC of diesel fuel [329]. The auto-ignition of highly
active  monoatomic  hydrogen  could  cause  the  partial  combustion  of
diesel fuel before reaching the piston TDC while lowering power gen-
eration  and  increasing  BSFC  [329].  In  addition,  different  trends  have
been  reported  in  the  BSFC  of  diesel  fuel  upon  including  HHO  under
various engine loads. For example, HHO addition to diesel fuel could not
significantly affect the BSFC of diesel fuel at higher engine loads in the
study conducted by Rashad et al. [330]. HHO addition to intake air at
higher engine loads could decrease the excess air ratio and lower oxygen
concentration in the combustion chamber. This change could reduce the
diesel  fuel burned and  lower the  output power.  Unlike higher  engine
loads, excess air ratio could suffice to burn HHO and diesel fuel at lower
engine loads. This issue could increase the power output, consequently
decreasing  BSFC  [330].  It  has  also  been  reported  that  lower  concen-
trations of HHO could increase the BSEC of diesel fuel under lower en-
gine  load  conditions  [322].  This  result  might  be  attributed  to  more
cooling loss at lower engine load conditions, lowering the in-cylinder
temperature and increasing BSEC.

HHO  could  lower  the  BSFC  of  diesel  engines  fueled  with  diesel/

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience98(2023)10110027

S.H. Hosseini et al.

biodiesel/kerosene blends because of its higher calorific values [318].
Some studies have also reported that HHO induction could decrease the
BSFC  of  CNG-fueled  diesel  engines  [112,331].  The  higher  laminar
combustion velocity, wider flammability limits, and shorter quenching
distance of hydrogen present in HHO could shift stable engine operation
to leaner mixtures while improving thermal efficiency [316,325]. The
methane oxidation rate in CNG could be sped up in the presence of HHO
[325].

7.2. Combustion parameters

-  In-cylinder pressure

It  has  been  found  that  adding  HHO  to  diesel/biodiesel  fuel  could
increase the in-cylinder pressure of the engine because of the instanta-
neous combustion of the gas mixture [317,319,321]. The higher energy
content,  burning  velocity,  and  diffusivity  of  monoatomic  hydrogen
present in HHO could be the other main reasons for this finding [317,
319,321].

-  Heat release rate

Reportedly,  HHO  addition  could  increase  the  heat  release  rate  of
diesel/biodiesel  fuel  [317,319,321,322].  The  higher  flame  speed  and
diffusivity of HHO could lead to more homogeneous air-fuel mixtures,
causing instantaneous combustion and increasing the heat release rate.
HHO could also make close the peak heat release rate of diesel fuel to the
top dead center, resulting in higher cycle efficiency [322]. However, it
has also been reported that HHO addition could lower the heat release
rate  of  diesel  fuel  [329].  This  result  could  be  because  the  ignition  of
hydrogen present in HHO gas could occur before the piston reached TDC
[324,329].

-  Ignition delay

Reportedly, HHO addition to diesel fuel could shorten ignition delay
because it provides a homogeneous air-fuel mixture [317,321]. It has
also been claimed that HHO addition to diesel fuel could prolong igni-
tion delay because of its higher self-ignition temperature than petroleum
diesel [322].

-  Combustion duration

The combustion duration has shown different trends when doping
diesel fuel with HHO under different engine torque conditions [324].
HHO addition to diesel fuel could shorten combustion duration at lower
engine torque operating conditions because of efficient air and HHO gas
mixing. The presence of oxygen in HHO could also enhance the com-
bustion  process,  decreasing  combustion  duration.  However,  the  com-
bustion duration of diesel fuel could be prolonged under higher engine
torque operating conditions when introducing HHO into the combustion
chamber  [324].  The  rate  of  HHO  introduced  into  the  combustion
chamber could dramatically be increased at higher engine torque con-
ditions. This change could reduce the concentration of air available for
combustion  and  alter  the  physical  properties  of  the  charge,  thus
decreasing the speed of diffusion combustion because of fuel bulkiness
[324].

7.3. Exhaust emissions

-  Carbon monoxide emissions

As reported in Table S13, incorporating HHO in diesel/biodiesel fuel
has  been  observed  to  reduce  CO  emissions  in  most  investigations
[317–319,332].  The  hydrogen  and  oxygen  content  of  HHO  could

accelerate the fuel oxidation process and ensure the complete combus-
tion  process  [318,320].  The  absence  of  carbon  in  HHO  could  be  the
other reason for this finding [171,313,320]. The high flame speed and
broad  flammability  range  of  HHO  can  facilitate  fast  and  complete
oxidation of the fuel [46,320]. The increased in-cylinder temperature
resulting from hydrogen combustion could also promote the conversion
of CO to CO2 [321,333]. HHO addition could increase the turbulency of
the in-cylinder air-fuel mixture while enhancing the fuel oxidation rate
[317]. The highly reactive monoatomic hydrogen and oxygen could also
catalyze the fuel combustion process, thus reducing CO concentrations
[334]. Interestingly, the reduction in the CO emissions from biodiesel
fuel in response to HHO inclusion could be more pronounced than diesel
fuel because of the oxygen content in both HHO gas and biodiesel [335,
336]. It should be noted that the HHO inclusion rate and engine load are
important in CO emission. For example, Selvi Rajaram et al. [322] have
reported that the CO emissions from diesel fuel could be higher at lower
HHO inclusion rates under lower engine loads. They have argued that
the  higher  heat  rejection  rate  to  the  cooling  medium  and  lower
in-cylinder temperature at lower engine loads could be the main reasons
for  this  increase.  However,  higher  in-cylinder  temperatures  at  higher
engine loads could reduce CO formation.

As summarized in Table S14, adding HHO to diesel/biodiesel/kero-
sene blends could mitigate the CO emissions from diesel engines [318].
A decrease in the CO emissions from CNG-fueled diesel engines could be
observed when inducting HHO into the combustion chamber [331]. The
higher  oxygen  and  hydrogen  contents  of  HHO  gas  could  accelerate
oxidation  reactions  while  lowering  CO  formation.  However,  some  re-
searchers have claimed that adding HHO to CNG-fueled diesel engines
could negatively increase CO emissions [316,325]. This increase might
be attributed to the lower in-cylinder oxygen concentration caused by
the CNG induction [316].

-  Carbon dioxide emissions

It has been reported that the carbon-free HHO could lower the CO2
emissions  from  diesel/biodiesel  fuel  by  reducing  the  liquid  fuel  con-
sumption rate [324,332,334]. However, an increase in CO2  emissions
from diesel fuel could be observed in some investigations in response to
HHO  inclusion  [337,338].  Indeed,  adding  HHO  to  diesel  fuel  could
complete combustion and catalyze oxidation, increasing CO2 emissions
[338]. Notably, CO2  emissions are affected by the HHO inclusion rate
and engine load. Unlike lower HHO inclusion rates and engine loads,
CO2  emissions could be negatively increased at higher HHO inclusion
rates and engine loads [322]. Increasing the in-cylinder temperature by
increasing the engine load could promote oxidation and increase CO2
emission.  A  higher  HHO  inclusion  rate  could  also  make  the  air-fuel
mixture more homogeneous, resulting in more CO2 formation [322].

Reportedly, HHO  addition  could  decrease the  CO2  emissions  from
diesel engines fueled with diesel/biodiesel/kerosene blends [318]. This
decrease could be ascribed to the carbon-free nature of HHO gas [318].
Using HHO in CNG-fueled diesel engines could decrease CO2 emissions
by increasing the H/C ratio [316,325,331].

-  Unburned hydrocarbon emissions

Several studies have reported that adding HHO to diesel/biodiesel
fuel could mitigate UHC emissions [313,317,321]. HHO could cause the
generation of more OH free radicals during combustion. The generated
OH radicals with strong oxidizing properties could promote the hydro-
carbon  chain  breakage  and  continuously  oxidize  UHC  after  the  main
combustion period [339]. The higher diffusion coefficient, wider igni-
tion  limits,  smaller  ignition  energy,  shorter  quenching  distance,  and
faster flame propagation speed of hydrogen present in HHO could also
promote  the  combustion  process  [313,328,339].  The  higher  monoa-
tomic  oxygen  content  of  carbon-free  HHO  could  also  yield  better

S.H. Hosseini et al.

combustion  [320,328].  The higher  in-cylinder  temperature  caused by
HHO addition could improve the combustion process, mitigating UHC
emissions [317]. The reduction in UHC emissions could be more pro-
nounced  by  adding  HHO to  biodiesel  because of the  inherent  oxygen
content of both biodiesel and HHO [333]. Unlike the above arguments,
there could be an increase in the UHC emissions from diesel fuel at lower
HHO  inclusion  rates  because  of  reduced  in-cylinder  temperature  and
incomplete combustion [322,324].

combustion  chamber,  increasing  fuel  richness.  More  importantly,
hydrogen  present in  HHO  could  rapidly consume  most  of  the oxygen
supplied to the combustion chamber while leaving out partially oxidized
heavier and higher hydrocarbons [342]. Furthermore, lower HHO in-
clusion rates under lower engine loads could not significantly decrease
the smoke emissions from diesel fuel because of a decrease in adiabatic
flame  temperature  [322].  At  lower  HHO  inclusion  rates,  hydrogen
combustion could depend  on the local temperature around parcels of
air-fuel mixtures [322].

-  Nitrogen oxide emissions

Almost  all  studies  have  reported  that  adding  HHO  gas  to  diesel/
biodiesel  fuel  could  increase  NOx  emissions  [317,320,321,337].  This
result could be attributed to the hydrogen content of HHO, resulting in
higher in-cylinder temperature and faster burning rate [35]. The mon-
oatomic oxygen present in HHO could also react with the nitrogen in the
air, forming more NOx [324,327,340]. Increasing the residence time of
combustion  gases  in  response  to  HHO  addition  could  increase  NOx
emissions [317,321,333]. On the contrary, it has been found in some
studies  that  HHO  addition  to  diesel  fuel  could  lower  NOx  emissions
[329,341].  This  result  could  be  attributed  to  the  auto-ignition  of
hydrogen before TDC (before the start of diesel injection), shortening
the fuel ignition delay phase and decreasing the premixed combustion
phase intensity [329]. In addition, NOx emissions have shown different
trends by adding HHO gas to diesel fuel with different concentrations
under varying engine loads [322,342]. For example, adding less HHO
under lower engine loads could not negatively increase NOx emissions
because of lower in-cylinder temperatures [322]. However, the higher
in-cylinder temperatures caused by instantaneous combustion of HHO
gas after pilot diesel fuel injection under higher engine loads could in-
crease  NOx  emissions  [322].  Unlike  the  above  investigation,  Sub-
ramanian et al. [342] have observed a reduction in NOx emissions at
higher  HHO  concentrations  due  to  decreased  air  intake  (oxygen
concentration).

HHO addition to diesel/biodiesel/kerosene could lower NOx emis-
sions from diesel engines [318]. Even though both biodiesel and HHO
could increase the NOx emissions from diesel engines by increasing the
in-cylinder oxygen concentration, kerosene could effectively deal with
this problem by prolonging the ignition delay and suppressing the for-
mation  of  active  radicals [318]. The  NOx emissions  from CNG-fueled
diesel  engines  could  be  effectively  lowered  by  introducing  HHO  gas
into the combustion chamber [316,325,331]. Although HHO could in-
crease  the  NOx  emissions  from  diesel  engines  by  increasing  oxygen
concentration and elevating combustion temperature [325], CNG could
solve this issue by lowering the flame speed.

-  Soot/smoke emissions

According to the findings of several investigations, adding HHO to
diesel/biodiesel fuel could lower smoke formation [317,321,324]. The
induction  of  HHO  gas  could  rapidly  fracture  heavier  and  higher  hy-
drocarbons  into  lighter  and  smaller  ones,  leading  to  a  homogeneous
air-fuel  mixture  [322,328].  The  reduction  in  the  C/H  ratio  resulting
from  HHO  addition  could  complete  combustion  and  lower  smoke
emissions [317,321]. The presence of active hydrogen radicals in HHO
gas could shorten ignition delay while completing oxidation reactions.
The  water  vapor  produced  during  hydrogen  combustion  could  accel-
erate  fuel  decomposition  and  the  mixture  homogeneity  [334].  The
higher diffusion coefficient of hydrogen could increase flame penetra-
tion  levels  during  early  combustion  (before  the  main  fuel  injection
period),  thus  enhancing  the  oxidation  of  carbon  compounds  [334].
Interestingly,  the  effect  of  HHO  on  the  smoke  emission  reduction  of
diesel fuel could be higher than pure hydrogen since its higher oxygen
content could lead to efficient combustion [342]. On the contrary, it has
been  claimed  that  HHO  addition  to  diesel  fuel  could  increase  smoke
emissions  [342].  HHO  induction  could  decrease  air  entering  the

-  Particulate matter emissions

than  petrodiesel  because  of

Adding HHO to diesel/biodiesel fuel could mitigate PM emissions by
increasing the hydrocarbon oxidation rate [319,339]. In addition, HHO
addition to diesel/biodiesel fuel could promote the disturbance within
the cylinder while enhancing combustion and lowering PM emissions
[339]. The carbon-free HHO could also increase the formation of OH
free  radicals  and  boost  the  oxidation  of  PM.  The  reduction  in  PM
emissions from biodiesel fuel in response to HHO addition could be more
pronounced
its  oxygen-rich  and
aromatic-free  nature  [319].  Interestingly,  HHO  could  also  markedly
affect  the  morphology  and  structure of  the  PM  generated  during bio-
diesel combustion. As revealed by SEM images, HHO could reduce the
bulk/flocculence form particles while increasing chain and branch form
ones [339]. TEM images have indicated that adding HHO to biodiesel
can reduce the stacking between individual carbon particles, increase
the gap between different carbon particles, and decrease the degree of
aggregation. The formation of the active OH radicals in response to HHO
addition could oxidize the soluble organic matter on the particle surface,
thus decreasing the particle surface stickiness and the particle collision
agglomeration. The lower activation energy required for the reaction of
OH  radicals  with  precursors,  such  as  benzene,  could  lead  to  the  sup-
pression of particle nucleation [339].

8. Use of syngas with diesel/biodiesel blends

Syngas (producer gas) containing hydrogen, carbon monoxide, car-
bon dioxide, and methane is a promising alternative to gaseous fuels (e.
g., CNG, NG, and LPG). This gaseous fuel is derived from carbonaceous
materials (e.g., coal and biomass) under a restricted oxygen supply by
administering  minor  thermal  energy  [343–345].  Like  other  gaseous
fuels, syngas could not auto-ignite at diesel engine in-cylinder temper-
atures because of its high self-ignition temperature and octane number.
Therefore, a small quantity of pilot liquid fuel must be injected to trigger
combustion. Syngas also reduces the thermal efficiency of diesel engines
while increasing UHC and CO emissions. In addition, there is a signifi-
cant decrease in volumetric efficiency and an increase in ignition delay
of  diesel  engines  because  of  syngas  induction.  Oxygenated  biodiesel
could effectively cope with these drawbacks by improving combustion
[346]. Table S15 tabulates the effects of syngas induction on the com-
bustion  and  performance  characteristics  of  diesel  engines  ignited  by
diesel and biodiesel fuels and their blends.

8.1. Performance indicators

-  Brake thermal efficiency and brake specific fuel/energy consumption

Some studies have reported that adding syngas could improve the
BTE  of  diesel  engines  fueled  with  diesel/biodiesel  blends  [347–349].
The  higher  hydrogen  content  of  syngas  could  cause  a  higher  energy
release and combustion rate, thus enhancing BTE [347,348]. It has also
been reported that incorporating nanoparticles into diesel/biodiesel fuel
could improve syngas combustion and BTE [350]. In fact, the catalytic
activity  of  nanoparticles  could  accelerate  fuel  oxidation  and  improve
volumetric efficiency [350]. However, almost all the investigations in
this domain have reported that adding syngas could lower the BTE of

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience98(2023)10110029

S.H. Hosseini et al.

diesel engines fueled with diesel/biodiesel blends mainly because of the
lower  volumetric  calorific  value  of  syngas  [351–353].  In  addition,
decreasing  in-cylinder  oxygen  concentration  in  response  to  syngas
addition could result in incomplete combustion of the air-fuel mixture
(more unburned gas escaping from the combustion chamber), lowering
BTE [354,355]. The presence of inert incombustible gases (CO2 and N2)
in  the  syngas  composition  could  prolong  the  ignition  lag  phase  and
reduce  the  reaction  rate  while  delaying  the  heat  delivery  rate  in  the
expansion stroke and lowering thermal efficiency [353,356–358]. The
lower cetane number, lower burning rate, and higher compression work
of syngas could cause reduced combustion efficiency and lowered BTE
[359].  The  reduction  in  BTE  could  become  more  pronounced  when
igniting syngas with biodiesel [360,361]. This issue could be attributed
to the higher viscosity, lower volatility, lower calorific value of biodiesel
fuel, and the previously mentioned drawbacks of syngas [360,362,363].
Furthermore, igniting the air-syngas mixture with biodiesel could pro-
long  the  ignition  delay  [57].  The  BTE  may  be  reduced  in  the
biodiesel-syngas dual-fuel mode due to the lower adiabatic flame tem-
perature of syngas, which is caused by its lower equivalence ratio [364].
It  has  been  claimed  that  adding  syngas  could  decrease  the  BSFC/
BSEC of diesel engines [348,349,365,366]. The higher diffusivity of the
hydrogen  present  in  the  syngas  could  cause  uniform  mixing  while
enhancing the combustion process [348]. Reportedly, adding oxygen-
ated additives (e.g., diethyl ether) to diesel/biodiesel fuel could lower
the  fuel  consumption  of  syngas-fueled  diesel  engines  by  promoting
complete combustion [367–369]. On the contrary, several studies have
reported that adding syngas to diesel/biodiesel fuel could increase the
BSFC/BSEC  of  diesel  engines  [370–373].  This  result  could  be  mainly
related to the lower calorific value and lower flame propagation velocity
of  syngas  [351,359,372,374].  The  inefficient  energy  conversion  from
the fuel to useful work because of the inert gases present in the syngas
could  result  in  the  engine  power  derating  [357].  A  reduction  in  the
airflow rate (oxygen concentration) could cause incomplete combustion
(similar to premixed dual-fuel operation), thus increasing BSFC/BSEC
[375]. The increase in the BSEC could be clearer when igniting syngas
with biodiesel [376]. This result could be because of the higher density,
lower heating value, and poor atomization of biodiesel compared with
diesel fuel.

8.2. Combustion parameters

-  In-cylinder pressure

Several studies have observed that adding syngas to diesel/biodiesel
fuel could increase the in-cylinder pressure of diesel engines [371,373,
377,378]. This increase could be related to the higher hydrogen con-
centration of syngas. However, some researchers have stated that adding
syngas could decrease the in-cylinder pressure of diesel engines fueled
with diesel/biodiesel blends [57,364,379,380]. This reduction could be
related to the lower calorific value of syngas and a subsequent decrease
in energy release rate during the premixed combustion phase [347,381].
Syngas  could  shift  the  overall  combustion  to  expansion  stroke  by
shortening combustion duration and prolonging ignition delay (because
of a reduction in oxygen concentration), thus resulting in a reduction in
the in-cylinder pressure [372,379]. The reduction in the quantity of the
pilot fuel injection could also be the other reason for this finding [347].
The  reduction  in  the  in-cylinder  pressure  could  be  more  pronounced
when  igniting  syngas  with  biodiesel.  This  issue  could  be  because  the
lower calorific value, higher viscosity, higher density, and lower vola-
tility of biodiesel could cause poor combustion at the rapid combustion
phase [364,382].

-  Heat release rate

engines [373,378,383]. On the contrary, some researchers have found a
decrease in the peak heat release rate of diesel engines in response to
syngas  addition  [347,377,384,385].  Indeed,  the  poor  auto-ignition
quality  of  syngas  could  result  in  the  air-fuel  mixture  burning  in  the
diffusion combustion phase rather than the premixed combustion phase
[347,384]. The higher specific heat capacity and carbon dioxide content
of syngas could also prolong ignition delay and decrease the peak heat
release rate [377]. A decrease in pilot-fuel injection during the premixed
combustion  phase  because  of  syngas  addition  could  cause  a  longer
combustion  process  while  deteriorating  the  heat  release  rate  [386].
Using  biodiesel  to  ignite  syngas  could  further  decrease  the  peak  heat
release  rate  of  diesel  engines  because  of  the  higher  viscosity,  lower
volatility, lower calorific value, and higher surface tension of biodiesel
[364,371].

-  Ignition delay

Almost all the studies have found that adding syngas to diesel/bio-
diesel fuel could result in prolonged ignition delay [350,371,387]. This
issue  could  be  because  a  reduction  in  the  ignition  source  (pilot  fuel)
quantity could cause heat release during the diffusive combustion phase
rather than the premixed combustion phase [384]. The higher ignition
temperatures of combustible syngas components, i.e., H2 and CO, could
increase ignition delay [388]. A dilution of oxygen concentration within
the combustion chamber could be another reason for this finding [384].
The  cooling  effect  of  CO2  present  in  syngas  could  decrease  the
in-cylinder temperature during the compression stroke while prolonging
ignition delay [384]. The lower polytropic index of syngas could lower
charge  temperature  and  pressure  during  pilot  fuel  injection,  thus
extending the physical ignition delay period of the mixture [389]. The
increase  in  ignition  delay  could  be  more  pronounced  when  igniting
syngas with  biodiesel. The unfavorable physicochemical properties  of
biodiesel  and  the  poor  combustion  properties  of  syngas  could  be  the
main reason for this increase [360,382]. Unlike the above arguments,
some  researchers  have  stated  that  adding  syngas  to  diesel/biodiesel
could decrease ignition delay [390,391]. This decrease could be related
to the hydrogen-rich nature of syngas.

-  Combustion duration

Several studies have reported that adding syngas to diesel/biodiesel
increased the combustion duration of diesel engines [361,373,384]. The
poor ignition centers resulting from syngas addition could increase the
diffusive combustion phase while prolonging the combustion duration
[384]. The lower burning rate and adiabatic flame temperature of syn-
gas  could  also  increase  combustion  duration  [382,392].  The  higher
viscosity  of  biodiesel  could  cause  inappropriate  air-fuel  mixing  and
prolong  the  diffusion  combustion  phase,  thus  further  increasing  the
combustion duration of syngas-fueled diesel engines [361]. The longer
physical and chemical delay of biodiesel could also be another reason for
this increase [350]. On the contrary, some researchers have stated that
syngas  addition could decrease the  combustion duration of diesel  en-
gines  [355,379].  This  result  could  be  attributed  to  the  higher  flame
speed of hydrogen present in syngas. Adding nanoparticles to diesel/-
biodiesel  fuel  could  also  shorten  the  combustion  duration  of
syngas-fueled diesel engines [350]. The higher catalytic activity and the
larger area-volume ratio of nanoparticles could cause a uniform air-fuel
mixture while shortening ignition delay [350].

8.3. Exhaust emissions

-  Carbon monoxide emissions

Several studies have reported that adding hydrogen-rich syngas to
diesel/biodiesel  could  increase  the  peak  heat  release  rate  of  diesel

Table S16 tabulates the effects of syngas induction on the exhaust
emissions from diesel engines ignited by diesel and biodiesel fuels and
their blends. Based on the findings of almost all the studies published in

this domain, adding syngas to diesel/biodiesel fuel could increase the
CO emissions from diesel engines [366,372,393]. The presence of CO in
syngas and excessive charge dilution could be the main reasons for this
increase [347,349]. It should be noted that decreasing oxygen concen-
tration in response to syngas addition and the presence of CO2 in syngas
could cause charge dilution, resulting in incomplete combustion of fuel
[377]. This increase could also be attributed to the lower heating value,
flame velocity, adiabatic flame temperature, and mean effective pres-
sure  of  syngas  [360,394,395].  A  significant  portion  of  the  syngas
introduced into the combustion chamber could remain unburned during
the combustion process because of forcing it into the crevice zones of the
cylinder  during  the  compression  stroke  [396].  Increasing  the  syngas
supplement rate could further increase CO concentration in the exhaust
combustion  gas  by  provoking  improper  ignition  timing,  prolonging
ignition delay, increasing combustion duration, and degrading ignition
centers [396]. The increase in CO emissions could be more pronounced
when using biodiesel as an ignition source [397]. The main reasons for
this finding could be attributed to several properties of biodiesel, such as
its  higher  viscosity,  density,  and  surface  tension,  as  well  as  its  lower
calorific  value  and  volatility  [350,397].  However,  some  studies  have
claimed that incorporating syngas into biodiesel fuel could cause lower
CO  formation  than  its  addition  to  diesel  [376].  The  in-built  oxygen
content  of  biodiesel  could  be  the  main  reason  for  this  reduction.  In
addition, doping diesel/biodiesel blends with nanoparticles could miti-
gate the CO emissions from syngas-fueled diesel engines by catalyzing
oxidation reactions [350].

-  Carbon dioxide emissions

Almost all studies have observed increased CO2 emissions from diesel
engines upon including syngas in diesel/biodiesel [371,398,399]. The
higher CO, CO2,  and CH4  concentrations in syngas could be the main
reason for this increase [389,400]. Increasing CO2  emissions could be
more significant when igniting syngas with biodiesel [376]. The struc-
tural oxygen content of biodiesel could accelerate the oxidation of CO
present  in  syngas,  thus  increasing  CO2  emissions  [376].  In  addition,
incorporating oxygenated additives into diesel/biodiesel could increase
the  CO2  emissions  from  syngas-fueled  diesel  engines  [367–369,401].
The structural oxygen content of these additives could promote oxida-
tion reactions, thus increasing CO2 emission. Surprisingly, some studies
have claimed that incorporating syngas into diesel/biodiesel fuel could
decrease  the  CO2  emissions  from  diesel  engines  [393,395,402].  They
have  attributed  this  reduction  to  a  decrease  in  the  oxidation  rate
(incomplete combustion) in response to oxygen dilution resulting from
syngas addition [402].

-  Unburned hydrocarbon emissions

The published literature has almost unanimously agreed that adding
syngas to diesel/biodiesel fuel could increase the UHC emissions from
diesel  engines  [373,399].  The  lower  burning  rate  of  syngas  and  the
in-cylinder  oxygen  dilution  because  of  syngas  induction  could  cause
incomplete  combustion  [349,403].  Syngas  could  also  lead  to  flame
quenching in crevice regions and at cylinder walls, thus increasing UHC
emissions [402]. The lower calorific value of syngas and the presence of
inert gases in its composition could be the other reasons for this increase
[357].  The  lower  charge  temperature  in  response  to  syngas  addition
could lead to slower combustion and prolonged ignition delay, allowing
a portion of fuel to leave the combustion chamber unburned [354,359].
Moreover, the composition of syngas, with its high content of carbon
and hydrogen molecules, could lead to excessively fuel-rich mixtures,
potentially increasing UHC emissions [365,404]. The hydrogen in syn-
gas could quickly react with oxygen, thus depleting the oxygen available
to oxidize higher hydrocarbons [365,404]. Doping diesel/biodiesel fuel
with  oxygenated  additives  could  further  increase  the  UHC  emissions
from  syngas-fueled  diesel  engines  because  of  their  higher  heat  of

evaporation and a subsequent reduction in the in-cylinder temperature
[367].  Furthermore,  diesel  engines  could  generate  more  UHC  when
igniting syngas with biodiesel [360,361]. This result could be because of
the higher viscosity and density of biodiesel, leading to relatively poor
atomization [376]. However, it has been reported that the inbuilt oxy-
gen content of biodiesel could promote combustion, lowering the UHC
emissions  from  syngas-fueled  diesel  engines  [376,389].  Incorporating
nanoparticles into  diesel/biodiesel  could also mitigate the  UHC  emis-
sions  from  syngas-fueled  diesel  engines  by  catalyzing  oxidation  re-
actions [350].

-  Nitrogen oxide emissions

Several studies have reported increased NOx emissions from diesel
engines  upon  the  induction  of  syngas  [384,390,405].  Increasing  NOx
emissions  might  be  attributed  to  an  increase  in  the  adiabatic  flame
temperature  resulting  from  the  higher  hydrogen  content  of  syngas
[390]. This increase could become dramatic when igniting syngas with
biodiesel [376]. The in-built oxygen content of biodiesel could lead to
complete  combustion,  thus  elevating  combustion  temperature  and
increasing NOx emissions [57,376,406]. It has also been reported that
doping  diesel/biodiesel  blends  with  nanoparticles  could  increase  the
NOx  emissions  from  syngas-fueled  diesel  engines  due  to  improved
oxidation and combustion reactions [350]. In contrast with the above
arguments, many studies have claimed that incorporating syngas into
diesel/biodiesel fuel could decrease the NOx emissions from diesel en-
gines  [358,361,372,379].  Syngas  induction  could  dilute  nitrogen  and
oxygen in the intake air, thus reducing the chance of thermal NOx for-
mation [402]. In addition, the lower heating value of syngas and the
significant amount of inert components in its composition (cooling effect
of CO2  present in syngas) could reduce the mean in-cylinder tempera-
ture and its peak [347,388,402]. Syngas could also lead to lean com-
bustion and lowered NO emissions [347]. The prolonged ignition delay
because of syngas induction could reduce peak in-cylinder temperature,
thus lowering NOx emissions [407]. The formation of the homogenous
air-fuel mixture in response to syngas addition could result in a more
uniform  temperature  distribution  while  reducing  high-temperature
zones  around  the  diesel  flame  [394].  Using  biodiesel  as  an  ignition
source could lead to a more significant decrease in NOx emissions when
combusted  with  syngas  [360].  This  issue  could  be  because  the  lower
calorific  value  of  biodiesel  could  lower  the  in-cylinder  temperature
[360].  The  lower  heat  release  rate  during  the  premixed  combustion
phase  of  biodiesel  than  diesel  could  be  another  reason  for  the  NOx
reduction [382].

-  Soot/smoke emissions

Reportedly, adding syngas to diesel/biodiesel blends could increase
the  soot/smoke  emissions  from  diesel  engines  [403,408,409].  Syngas
could  reduce  the  in-cylinder  oxygen  concentration,  thus  resulting  in
incomplete combustion and increased soot/smoke emissions [410,411].
The  lower  combustion  temperature  in  response  to  the  lower  calorific
value of syngas could be another reason for this increase. Syngas could
cause  incomplete  combustion  by  forming  over-rich  combustion  mix-
tures,  thus  increasing  soot/smoke  emissions  [349,403].  Furthermore,
syngas ignition with biodiesel could increase soot/smoke emissions from
diesel engines because of its heavier molecular weight, higher viscosity,
higher density, lower calorific value, and poor atomization [364,382,
387].  On  the  contrary,  it  has  been  claimed  in  several  studies  that
incorporating  syngas  into  diesel/biodiesel  fuel  could  reduce  the
soot/smoke emissions from diesel engines [370,385,412]. Syngas could
lead  to  a  more  homogenous  fuel  mixture  and  a  lower  local  fuel-air
equivalence ratio, thus reducing soot/smoke formation [385]. The in-
duction  of  syngas  (without  sooting  burning components)  could lower
the  aromatic-rich  liquid  fuel  consumption  rate  while  mitigating
soot/smoke formation [354,388,407]. The hydrogen present in syngas

could suppress soot/smoke formation by promoting combustion [388].
The reduction in soot/smoke emissions could be attributed to a reduc-
tion in diffusion combustion in response to syngas addition. The lean
premixed combustion because of syngas addition could lower particu-
late formation, thus reducing soot/smoke emissions [347]. The reduc-
tion in soot/smoke emissions could be exacerbated when using biodiesel
and its blends with oxygenated additives as ignition sources [357,368].
The structural oxygen content of biodiesel and its higher cetane number
could reduce soot/smoke emissions [357]. The higher oxygen content of
oxygenated  additives  could  enhance  the  diffusion  combustion  phase,
which could subsequently reduce soot/smoke emissions [368,413].

-  Particulate matter emissions

It has been observed in some studies that adding syngas to diesel/
biodiesel fuel could decrease the PM emissions from diesel engines [352,
355]. This result could be attributed to a reduction in the contribution of
liquid fuel to the air-fuel mixture (since liquid fuel has a stronger ten-
dency to soot than syngas). Syngas could lead to shortened combustion
duration and decreased diffusion combustion phase, thus mitigating PM
emissions [355]. In addition, syngas could reduce the number of fine
particulates (PM < 2.5 μm) emissions when incorporated into diesel/-
biodiesel blends (Fig. 26) [414]. Nevertheless, syngas addition to die-
sel/biodiesel blends could cause larger and more compact aggregates.

9. Unregulated emissions from hydrogen-fueled diesel engines

Most  of  the  researchers  dealing  with  the  exhaust  emissions  from
diesel engines often record and analyze regulated emissions. Although
the unregulated emissions  from diesel engines are usually lower than
regulated  ones,  these  compounds  are  very  toxic,  carcinogenic,  and
mutagenic.  The  unregulated  emissions  from  diesel  engines  can  cause
respiratory issues, pregnancy complications, and risks to infants [415].

-  Formaldehyde and acetaldehyde emissions

Formaldehyde (HCHO) and acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) are two com-
mon  aldehydes  emitted  from  diesel  engines.  These  carcinogenic

compounds  cause  respiratory  difficulty,  eczema,  and  sensitization
[153]. Hydrogen could lower the formaldehyde emissions from diesel
engines by prolonging ignition delay and promoting diffusion combus-
tion  [201].  More  specifically,  formaldehyde  is  generated  in  the  “cool
flame” stage of diesel auto-ignition, while OH radicals degrade it at the
start of diesel diffusion flame development. Hydrogen could prolong the
diffusion combustion phase and provide OH radicals, reducing formal-
dehyde formation [153]. Hydrogen addition to diesel fuel could signif-
icantly  mitigate  the  acetaldehyde  emissions  from  diesel  engines  by
reducing the C–H bond ratio of the air-fuel mixture. Reducing the C–H
bond ratio could decrease paraffin content and acetaldehyde formation
[153,201,415].  Hydrogen  could  also  elevate  the  in-cylinder  gas  tem-
perature  because  of  its  rapid  burning  rate,  favoring  the  oxidation  of
formaldehyde [236]. However, it should be noted that hydrogen addi-
tion  could  not  effectively  reduce  the  formaldehyde  and  acetaldehyde
emissions from diesel engines at higher engine loads and speeds [153].
The shortened diffusion combustion phase at higher engine loads and
speeds  could  negatively  increase  formaldehyde  and  acetaldehyde
emissions. The competition of oxygen by diesel fuel and hydrogen for
combustion  at  higher  engine  loads  and  speed  could  deteriorate  the
oxidation of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde [236]. In addition, there
could  be  no  significant  reduction  in  formaldehyde  and  acetaldehyde
emissions at lower hydrogen inclusion rates [415].

-  Ethylene, propylene, and 1, 3-butadiene emissions

Ethylene and propylene are typical intermediates arising from diesel
fuel  pyrolysis.  The  competition  between  pyrolysis  and  oxidation  re-
actions strongly affects ethylene and propylene formation in diesel en-
gines. In addition, in-cylinder temperature and air-to-fuel equivalence
ratio have a significant effect on the formation of ethylene and propyl-
ene  [153].  The  carcinogenic  1,  3-butadiene  is  a  conjugated  dialkene
commonly  emitted  from  diesel  engines.  1,  3-butadiene  formation  in
diesel  engines  strongly  depends  on  the  residence  time  of  the  air-fuel
mixture within the combustion chamber and the local oxygen concen-
tration  [236].  In  general,  hydrogen  addition  could  effectively  reduce
these  intermediates  (particularly  at  medium  engine  loads  and  lower
engine speeds) by reducing the total C–H ratio and the C–C bonds of the

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience98(2023)10110032

S.H. Hosseini et al.

air-fuel mixture [236]. In addition, hydrogen could prohibit diesel fuel
pyrolysis, thus lowering the concentrations of ethylene and propylene
[236].  Hydrogen  addition  could  reduce  1,  3-butadiene  emissions  by
promoting  its  reaction  with  NO2  at  medium  engine  loads  [236].  It
should be noted that hydrogen addition could cause a sharp increase in
NO2 formation.

However,  hydrogen  addition  could  not  effectively  mitigate  these
intermediates  at  lower  engine  loads,  higher  engine  loads,  and  higher
engine speeds. The lower in-cylinder gas temperature at lower engine
loads could hinder both diesel fuel pyrolysis and oxidation processes,
promoting the formation of ethylene and propylene. The lower air-to-
fuel equivalence ratio at higher engine loads could suppress oxidation
increasing  ethylene  and  propylene  emissions  [153].
reactions,
Increasing  engine  speed  could  lead  to  a  shorter  diffusion  combustion
phase. Accordingly, a significant portion of diesel and hydrogen could
be  consumed  in  the  premixed  combustion  phase,  deteriorating  the
oxidation of the generated ethylene and propylene [236]. The formation
of oxygen-rich zones (higher air-fuel equivalence ratio) at lower engine
loads could increase 1, 3-butadiene emissions [153]. The oxygen defi-
ciency at higher engine loads could be the main reason for the higher 1,
3-butadiene emission. The higher engine speed could result in shorter
residence time, leading to more 1, 3-butadiene emissions [153].

-  Aromatic hydrocarbons emissions

The aromatic hydrocarbons commonly emitted from diesel engines
are benzene, toluene, and xylene. These compounds result from diesel
pyrolysis and further grow into polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [415].
Hydrogen addition could lower the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons
in diesel engines by suppressing the generation of diesel pyrolysis in-
termediates [153,415]. Increasing in-cylinder temperature in response
to hydrogen addition could also increase the oxidation of the evolved
aromatic  hydrocarbons  [236].  However,  at  higher  engine  loads,  the
formation  of  aromatic  compounds  could  be  increased  because  of  the
consumption of O2, O, and OH radicals [415].

-  Methane emissions

Methane is generated in diesel engines through the pyrolysis of fuel
during combustion. This gas has a higher global warming potential than
CO2. Accordingly, methane formation in diesel engines must be reduced
as  much  as  possible  using  advanced  technologies  [221].  Hydrogen
addition  could  effectively  reduce  the  methane  emissions  from  diesel
engines due to increased in-cylinder temperature resulting from its high
flame speed and heat release rate [221].

10. Summary and outlook

10.1. Summary

The  present  work  is  devoted  to  comprehensively  reviewing  and
critically discussing the effects of hydrogen on the combustion, perfor-
mance, and emission characteristics of dual-fuel diesel engines. In gen-
eral,  it  is  not  straightforward  to  compare  the  data  reported  in  the
published  because  of  substantial  differences  in  engine  configurations,
fuel  compositions,  and  operating  conditions.  Based  on  the  published
literature, hydrogen inclusion rate, hydrogen introduction method, pilot
fuel properties, pilot fuel injection rate, engine design characteristics,
and engine operating conditions play important roles in exploiting the
potential  advantages  of  hydrogen  use  in  compression  ignition  diesel
engines. Some important conclusions from this review are summarized
as follows.

• Hydrogen  addition  to  diesel  fuel  could  improve  the  thermal  effi-
ciency of diesel engines while lowering the fuel consumption rate.
This  could  be  because  of  the  higher  heating  value  and  faster

combustion of gaseous hydrogen. Hydrogen could also compensate
for  the  lower  calorific  of  biodiesel  while  resolving  its  main  draw-
backs (i.e., lower BTE and higher BSFC). Higher hydrogen inclusion
rates could allow for more homogeneous charge combustion, leading
to  better  combustion  characteristics.  However,  adding  hydrogen
beyond  a  certain  level,  particularly  at  higher  engine  loads,  might
cause knocking problems. The hydrogen inclusion rate that leads to
knocking is different engine-by-engine, fuel-by-fuel, and condition-
by-condition.  Accordingly,  no  general  rule  for  the  optimal
hydrogen inclusion rate could be set.

• The high combustion temperature of hydrogen could enhance the in-
cylinder  pressure  and  heat  release  rate  of  diesel  engines.  Adding
hydrogen  to  diesel  fuel  could  reduce  the  combustion  duration
because of the high burning rate of gaseous hydrogen and the ac-
celeration of the air-fuel mixing process. Hydrogen addition could
increase  the  ignition  delay  of  diesel  engines  because  of  its  lower
cetane number and higher self-ignition temperature. Hydrogen could
effectively  mitigate  CO,  CO2,  HC,  PM,  smoke,  and  soot  emissions
from  diesel  engines  due  to  its  carbon-free  nature  and  capacity  to
homogenize  the  air-fuel  mixture.  Nevertheless,  adding  high-
energetic hydrogen to diesel fuel could increase NOx emissions due
to increased peak in-cylinder pressure and temperature.

• Using  nanomaterials  in  diesel  fuel  formulation  could  improve  the
combustion  quality  of  hydrogen-fueled  diesel  engines,  thus
improving their thermal efficiency and lowering fuel consumption
rate.  Similarly,  oxygenated  compounds  could  improve  the  perfor-
mance  parameters  of  hydrogen-fueled  diesel  engines.  This  issue
could  be  attributed  to  the  higher  latent  heat  of  vaporization  of
oxygenated  compounds  that could cool  down the  inlet charge, in-
crease  the  inlet  charge  density,  and  result  in  better  combustion.
Adding  oxygenated  compounds  and  nanoadditives  to  diesel  fuel
could  increase  the  heat  release  rate  of  hydrogen-fueled  diesel  en-
gines.  This  result  could  be  because  of  the  high  surface  area  of
nanoparticles that could speed up the evaporation of the injected fuel
and  shorten  the  ignition  delay.  The  oxygenated  compounds  could
also promote the combustion process, thus elevating the heat release
rate of hydrogen-fueled diesel engines. It should be noted that adding
oxygenated  compounds  beyond  a  certain  concentration  could
decrease the heat release rate of diesel engines because of their lower
calorific  value.  The  effects  of  nanoadditives  on  the  combustion
duration and ignition delay of hydrogen-fueled diesel engines have
not been studied. Nanoadditives could increase the cylinder pressure
of  hydrogen-fueled  diesel  engines  by  further  elevating  the  flame
propagation speed. Oxygenated additives could reduce the ignition
delay  of  hydrogen-fueled  diesel  engines  while  increasing  their  in-
cylinder pressure. Nanoadditives and oxygenated compounds could
reduce  the  CO,  CO2,  UHC,  PM,  and  soot/smoke  emissions  from
hydrogen-fueled diesel engines. This issue could be because of the
higher specific surface area and energetic content of nanoparticles
(promoting complete combustion) and structural oxygen content of
oxygenated  additives  (completing  the combustion  of carbon  parti-
cles).  The  lower  C/H  ratio  of  oxygenated  additives  could  also  be
another reason for the lower emissions. Nanoadditives and oxygen-
ated compounds could effectively prevent the formation of NOx in
hydrogen-fueled diesel engines. This reduction could occur because
of the micro-explosion phenomena in the presence of nanoparticles
and the higher latent heat of vaporization of oxygenated compounds.
• Hydrogen  could  effectively  resolve  the  challenges  associated  with
using  gaseous  fuels  (e.g.,  biogas,  methane,  CNG,  NG,  and  LPG)  in
diesel  engines,  such  as  prolonged  ignition  delay,  reduced  engine
performance,  decreased  burning  rate,  and  increased  CO  and  UHC
emissions. Hydrogen could improve the performance parameters of
biogas-fueled diesel engines by compensating for the lower calorific
value  of CO2-rich biogas and  improving its combustion.  Similarly,
hydrogen enrichment could improve the performance indicators of
methane-fueled diesel engines by promoting the combustion process.

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience98(2023)10110033

S.H. Hosseini et al.

Notably,  methane  could  also  offset  some  drawbacks  of  hydrogen
combustion  (e.g.,  low  quenching  distance).  Hydrogen  could  effec-
tively  compensate  for  the  low  flame  speed  of  CNG  and  NG,  thus
improving  their  combustion  in  diesel  engines.  Hydrogen  could
positively enhance the BTE of LPG-fueled diesel engines by making
the flame of LPG stable at lean gaseous fuel-air mixtures. Hydrogen
enrichment  could  increase  the  heat  release  rate  and  in-cylinder
pressure  of  biogas-,  methane-,  CNG-  and  NG-fueled  diesel  engines
by increasing the calorific value and laminar flame speed of the air-
fuel  mixture.  Hydrogen  addition  could  prolong  the  combustion
duration  of NG- and  methane-fueled diesel engines  by broadening
the flammable limits of the air-fuel mixture. Enriching CNG and LPG
with hydrogen could shorten the combustion duration of diesel en-
gines  by  accelerating  the  burning  rate  of  the  air-fuel  mixture.
Hydrogen addition to biogas prolonged the ignition delay of diesel
engines because of a reduction in the oxygen concentration of the
intake charge. Hydrogen addition to methane, CNG, and LPG could
decrease the ignition delay of diesel engines because of the promoted
combustion process.

• The CO and UHC emissions from diesel engines could be significantly
reduced  by  enriching  biogas,  methane,  CNG,  NG,  and  LPG  with
hydrogen. The reduction in emissions could be mainly attributed to
the partial replacement of the carbon-rich fuel with hydrogen, which
can  improve  the  combustion  rate  of  the  gaseous  fuel.  Adding
hydrogen to biogas, methane, CNG, and NG could decrease the CO2
emissions from diesel engines due to a decrease in the C/H ratio of
the gaseous mixtures. Hydrogen could negatively increase the NOx
emissions  from  biogas-,  methane-,  CNG-,  and  NG-diesel  engines
because of a drastic increase in the peak in-cylinder temperature and
pressure.  Hydrogen  addition  to  LPG  could  favorably  decrease  the
NOx  emissions  from  diesel  engines  because  of  a  reduction  in  the
high-temperature  region  around  the  diesel  flame.  Adding  carbon-
free  hydrogen  to  biogas,  methane,  and  CNG  could  mitigate  the
smoke and soot emissions from diesel engines. The higher diffusion
coefficient of hydrogen could cause a well-homogenized combustible
mixture, resulting in enhanced combustion efficiency and lowered
smoke emission.

• Inert  gases  could  effectively  mitigate  the  NOx  emissions  from
hydrogen-fueled diesel engines by lowering combustion pressure and
temperature rise. Nevertheless, inert gases could decrease the BTE of
hydrogen-fueled diesel engines by absorbing a considerable amount
of thermal energy from the fuel charge. Inert gases could dilute the
air-fuel mixture, thus lowering the peak in-cylinder temperature and
pressure  of  hydrogen-fueled  diesel  engines  and  controlling  their
knock.  Incorporating  inert  gases  into  hydrogen  could  prolong  the
ignition delay of diesel engines while shortening their combustion
duration. Inert gas could increase the CO and UHC emissions from
hydrogen-fueled diesel engines by reducing the oxygen concentra-
tion  within  the  cylinder  and  lowering  the  combustion  chamber
temperature. It should be noted that the reduction in the in-cylinder
oxygen concentration could suppress NOx formation. The simulta-
neous addition of hydrogen and inert gas to diesel fuel could effec-
tively  mitigate  soot  emissions  by  controlling  air-fuel  mixing  and
combustion processes.

• HHO  enrichment  could  be  a  viable  option  to  improve  the  perfor-
mance of diesel engines by maintaining exhaust emissions as low as
possible. HHO could also resolve storage and safety issues associated
with  using  hydrogen  in  diesel  engines.  HHO  could  improve  the
thermal efficiency of diesel engines and lower their fuel consumption
rate  by  increasing  the  calorific  value  of  the  air-fuel  mixture  and
enhancing  combustion  efficiency.  The  heat  release  rate  and  in-
cylinder  pressure  of  diesel  engines  could  be  increased  by  HHO
addition because of the higher flame speed and diffusivity of mon-
oatomic hydrogen. HHO addition to diesel fuel could shorten igni-
tion delay because it provides a homogeneous air-fuel mixture. There
could be a significant reduction in the CO, CO2, UHC, smoke, and PM

emissions from diesel engines upon including HHO. This issue could
be attributed to  the fact that the hydrogen and  oxygen content of
carbon-free  HHO  could  speed  up  the  fuel  oxidation  process  and
ensure the complete combustion process. HHO gas could effectively
cope with the adverse effects of gaseous fuel addition to diesel fuel (i.
e.,  reduced  performance  parameters  and  increased  CO  and  UHC
emissions).

• Despite  the  low-carbon  nature  of  syngas,  its  application  in  diesel
engines  could  reduce  the  thermal  efficiency  of  diesel  engines  and
increase  their  fuel  consumption  rate.  This  issue  could  mainly  be
attributed to the lower volumetric calorific value of CO2-rich syngas.
Using  nanoparticles  and  oxygenated  compounds  could  effectively
compensate  for  the  lower  calorific  value  of  syngas  by  promoting
complete combustion. A decrease in the peak heat release rate and
in-cylinder pressure of diesel engines could be observed in response
to  introducing  less-energetic  syngas.  The  higher  specific  heat  ca-
pacity  and  carbon  dioxide  content  of  syngas  could  also  prolong
ignition delay. The lower burning rate and adiabatic flame temper-
ature of syngas could result in increased combustion duration.
• Adding syngas to diesel/biodiesel fuel could increase the CO, CO2,
and UHC emissions from diesel engines. CO in syngas and excessive
charge  dilution  could  cause  the  incomplete  combustion  of  fuel.
Incorporating  oxygenated  additives  into  diesel/biodiesel  could  in-
crease  the  CO2  emissions  from  syngas-fueled  diesel  engines.  The
structural oxygen of these compounds could promote oxidation re-
actions, thus increasing CO2  emission. Doping diesel/biodiesel fuel
with oxygenated additives could further increase the UHC emissions
from  syngas-fueled  diesel  engines  because  of  their  higher  heat  of
evaporation and a subsequent reduction in the in-cylinder temper-
ature.  Incorporating  nanoparticles  into  diesel/biodiesel  could  also
mitigate  the  UHC  emissions  from  syngas-fueled  diesel  engines  by
catalyzing oxidation reactions.

• Incorporating  syngas  into  diesel/biodiesel  fuel  could  decrease  the
NOx  emissions  from  diesel  engines.  Syngas  induction  could  dilute
nitrogen and oxygen in the intake air, thus reducing the chance of
thermal  NOx  formation.  Syngas  could  decrease  the  PM  emissions
from diesel engines by lowering the rate of liquid fuel injection with
a  higher  sooting  tendency  than  syngas.  Adding  syngas  to  diesel/
biodiesel blends could increase the soot/smoke emissions from diesel
engines. Syngas addition could reduce the in-cylinder oxygen con-
centration, thus resulting in incomplete combustion and increased
soot/smoke emission. On the contrary, it has been claimed by several
researchers that syngas addition could lead to a more homogenous
fuel  mixture  and  a  lower  local  fuel-air  equivalence  ratio,  thus
reducing soot/smoke formation.

10.2. Outlook

Using hydrogen in diesel engines through the dual-fuel concept is a
promising approach to reducing diesel fuel consumption and mitigating
harmful  exhaust  emissions.  The  main  issue  associated  with  using
hydrogen in diesel engines is the higher NOx emissions that could be
effectively  controlled  with  several  approaches,  such  as  selective  cata-
lytic reduction technique, exhaust gas recirculation, water injection, use
of urea, external cooling of the cylinder walls, and Lean-NOx trap. In
addition, engine knocking is another main hurdle in fueling diesel en-
gines with hydrogen. To this end, the upper limit of the hydrogen in-
clusion rate should be determined for each engine configuration, pilot
fuel property, and operating condition. Using hydrogen in diesel engines
fueled  with  diesel/biodiesel  blends  could  be  a  promising  strategy  for
alleviating the dependence on fossil fuels. Biodiesel with various con-
centrations under different hydrogen inclusion rates has been used in
diesel engines. In better words, there could be no systematic approach to
determining  the  biodiesel  concentration  and  hydrogen  inclusion  rate.
Future research must use advanced machine learning approaches to find
optimal biodiesel concentration and hydrogen inclusion rate.

Although hydrogen could significantly mitigate PM emissions from
diesel  engines,  it  could  negatively  generate  ultrafine  PM  with  more
adverse environmental and human health effects. Therefore, the effect
of  hydrogen  addition  on  the  physical,  chemical,  and  morphological
characteristics of the particulates emitted from diesel engines should be
further investigated to identify their toxicity to humans and the envi-
ronment. Most published works have been case-specific under steady-
state engine operating conditions and could not be extended to other
engine types, fuel formulations, and operating conditions. Future work
should focus on developing a standardized test methodology under real-
world  conditions  to  make  comparing  the  obtained  results  easy.  The
economic, environmental, and social aspects of hydrogen-fueled diesel
engines need further investigation.

Oxygenated compounds and nanoadditives could promisingly solve
the main drawbacks of hydrogen-fueled diesel engines, i.e., NOx emis-
sions.  Nevertheless,  the  high  cost  of  these  additives  is  the  foremost
hurdle  to  their  realization.  The  optimal  dosage  of  additives  has  been
determined  by  the  trial-and-error  method  in  the  published  literature.
Therefore,  systematic  methods  should  be  applied  to  determine  the
optimal concentration of additives in the fuel blends by considering their
economic aspects. The long-term stability and uniform distribution of
additives  in  fuel  blends  present  additional  challenges  for  their  use  in
hydrogen-fueled  diesel  engines.  Before  introducing  the  technology  to
the market, the fate of nanoparticles after the combustion process and
their  adverse  health  and  environmental  effects  should  be  detailed.  In
order to avoid the release of nanoparticles in the environment, mem-
brane  filters  are  used  in  exhaust  gas  trapping  systems. Nanoadditives
and  oxygenated  compounds  might  cause  the  corrosiveness  of  fuel
handling  systems,  sludge  formation,  and  filter  clogging.  Further  in-
vestigations  are  required  to  analyze  the  effects  of  additives  on  the
corrosion  of  engine  parts  (piston,  piston  rings,  cylinder,  and  cylinder
linings).

Even though hydrogen could improve the performance and exhaust
emissions from gas-fueled diesel engines, increasing NOx emissions re-
mains  challenging.  Interestingly,  hydrogen  enrichment  could  only
significantly mitigate the NOx emissions from LPG-fueled diesel engines.
In  addition,  determining the  optimal  level  of  gas  fuel,  hydrogen,  and
diesel for the stable and reliable performance of diesel engines under

various  operating  conditions  is  a  challenging  issue  that needs  further
research. Using gas fuel and hydrogen requires two separate fuel tanks
that  occupy  a  large  space.  Some  gaseous  fuel  (e.g.,  biogas)  contains
several impurities even after refining. These impurities are very corro-
sive to metal parts of diesel engines. Gaseous fuels are prone to explosion
if they come in contact with oxygen and flammable material.

Despite  the  promising  features  of  inert  gases  in  lowering  NOx
emissions and solving the knocking problem of hydrogen-fueled diesel
engines, determining their optimal inclusion rate is not straightforward
during real-world operating conditions. Inert gases could also negatively
lower  the  performance  of  hydrogen-fueled  diesel  engines,  over-
shadowing the positive effect of hydrogen in the combustion process.
Hence, advanced systems must be installed on hydrogen-fueled diesel
engines  to  control  the  supply  of  inert  gas,  hydrogen,  and  diesel  to
optimize their performance over a wide range of operating conditions.
It seems HHO could pave the way for the realization of hydrogen-fuel
diesel engines by producing hydrogen in place. HHO could improve the
performance  parameters  of  diesel  engines.  This  gaseous  fuel  could
significantly reduce all the exhaust emissions from diesel engines except
NOx. If NOx emissions could be reduced by other approaches (such as
adding  additives,  injecting  water,  and  using  inert  gases),  the  HHO
approach could have the potential to be commercialized. Nevertheless,
this hydrogen supply method requires additional equipment (i.e., bat-
tery, electrolyzer, bubbler unit, flash arrestor, and storage tanks) while
making the fueling system more complex. HHO generation system re-
quires considerable modifications to in-use engine systems and occupies
significant  space.  The  operation  and  maintenance  costs  of  the  HHO
system are very high due to the fast corrosion of electrodes. The HHO
generation  efficiency  of  the  available  electrolyzers  is  also  not  high
(≈40–70%). Therefore, future research should comprehensively inves-
tigate  the  technical,  economic,  and  environmental  aspects  of  HHO
implementation on diesel.

Although syngas is a low-carbon fuel with the potential production
from  renewable  resources,  its  application  in  diesel  engines  could  in-
crease CO, CO2, UHC, and smoke emissions. Compressing syngas and air
turbocharging/supercharging could offset the main drawback of syngas
(i.e., its lower volumetric calorific value) while lowering CO, UHC, and
smoke emissions. The variations in syngas composition because of the

ProgressinEnergyandCombustionScience98(2023)10110035

S.H. Hosseini et al.

difference in feedstock properties and gasification conditions is another
challenging issue associated with its application in diesel engines. This
issue also makes determining the optimal level of syngas inclusion rate
difficult. Syngas also contains char nanoparticles and other impurities
that  negatively  affect  the  engine  performance  and  reliability  in  long-
term  applications.  Future  research  should  investigate  the  effects  of
syngas composition variations and impurities on the behavior of diesel
engines.  The  engine  operating  parameters  (i.e.,  injection  timing  and
ignition  advance)  must  be  optimized  for  improved  performance  and
reduced emissions. Based on the above discussion, a roadmap to over-
come the barriers of using hydrogen in diesel engines through the dual-
fuel concept is illustrated in Fig. 27.

Overall,  using hydrogen  in  diesel engines  could increase  the com-
bustion  chamber  temperature  and  result  in  knocking  (uneven)  com-
bustion. Future studies must focus on possible thermal stresses in engine
parts due to the higher combustion temperatures. Knocking combustion
can cause severe damage to engine parts, including breaking the piston
rings, melting the piston, and eroding the engine cylinder head. There-
fore,  advanced  intelligent  technologies  should  be  employed  to  avoid
knocking combustion by adjusting the hydrogen inclusion rate in real
time.  Future  work  should  focus  on  finding  the  optimal  fuel  blends,
operating parameters, and engine adjustments using advanced machine
learning  techniques  by  considering  technical,  thermodynamic,  eco-
nomic, and environmental issues.
