    "question_text": "Using principles from combustion science and energy systems, explain how the length of the alkyl chain in alcohol solvents affects the liquefaction rate of beech wood at 350째C, and describe the underlying molecular mechanisms strictly based on the provided research findings.",
    "standard_answer": "At 350째C, alcohols with longer alkyl chains exhibit faster wood liquefaction due to enhanced solvation capacity for high-molecular-weight intermediates. The mechanism involves improved dissolution of biomass degradation products, where longer-chain alcohols like 1-octanol can dissolve higher molecular weight fragments that shorter-chain alcohols cannot accommodate. This superior solvation prevents recombination of intermediates into solid residues, accelerating overall conversion. The improved performance of longer-chain alcohols is attributed to their ability to maintain solvent properties at high temperatures that favor dissolution of larger molecular fragments. Fluid mechanics principles govern the mass transfer and mixing of solvent with biomass particles, while heat transfer ensures the required temperature for depolymerization is achieved efficiently throughout the reaction system.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "At 350째C, however, it was apparent that alcohols with longer alkyl chains exhibited faster wood liquefaction. Thus 1-octanol was suggested for wood liquefaction.",
      "2": "Alcohols with longer alkyl chains can dissolve higher molecular weight products, which cannot be liquefied in alcohols with shorter alkyl chains. Thus a faster biomass conversion to liquefaction products can be obtained in alcohols with longer alkyl chains."
