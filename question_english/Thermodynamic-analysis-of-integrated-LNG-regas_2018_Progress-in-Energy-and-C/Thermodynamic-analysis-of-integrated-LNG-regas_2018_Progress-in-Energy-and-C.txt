Effective utilization of liquefied natural gas (LNG) cold energy during its regasification in both renewable
and nonrenewable processes is discussed and analyzed. Conventional and non-conventional thermody-
namic cycles, are described and categorized. Expressions for exergy and energy efficiencies are developed
to facilitate evaluation of the processes. Finally suggestions for improving the efficiency of such systems are
developed and the technical advantages and challenges are pointed out. The obtained results indicate that,
among the considered cycles, the highest energy and exergy efficiencies are about 86.3% and 80.0% respec-
tively; which is related to the combined cycles. Conversely the lowest energy and exergy efficiencies occur
in other application of LNG cold energy cycles (i.e., production of hydrogen by a solar aid liquefied natural
gas hybrid CO2 cycle) and Rankine cycle (i.e., CO2 transcritical geothermal power generation cycle) with the
values of 7.39% and 7.95%; respectively.

1. Introduction

With the current growing rate of energy consumption and envi-
ronmental issues, it is necessary to find energy resources that can
be utilized with higher efficiency. Renewable energies are good
resources to reduce the greenhouse gas effects [1]. To overcome
this issue and reducing emission of greenhouse gases many
attempts have been done to utilize the exhaust waste heat from the
flue gases [2]. Cold energy recovery of liquefied natural gas (LNG)
decreases the required refrigeration and causes energy saving in
the process [3]. LNG is transported by ship to the receiving terminal
at atmospheric pressure and temperature of about 110 K [4]. Natu-
ral gas liquefaction process consume a considerable amount of
energy, approximately 500 kW/h electric energy per ton of LNG, at
about ¡161 °C, which contains a significant amount of the cold
energy [5]. The required power for natural gas liquefaction process
changes between 0.45 and 0.55 kWh/kg [6]. The proximity of these
values shows that improving the liquefaction process performance
is almost difficult and limited. In the conventional supply chain of
natural gas, LNG after production is loaded into the especial insu-
lated tanks and after arriving to destination, it is pressurized to
suitable pressure for transportation via pipeline and then is vapor-
ized to reach the ambient temperature.

During the last two decades, regasification systems have not been
improved considerably, and 1.5% of LNG energy is consumed
through the vaporization [7]. In order to increasing LNG cold energy
recovery, various types of regasification processes have been investi-
gated [8(cid:1)10]. Vaporization systems usually use air or sea water as
the heat sources and therefore cold energy of LNG is wasted [11,12].
In order to overcome this issue, LNG regasification can be integrated
with other types of processes [13]. For instance, electrical power
cycle and other applications [14,15]. In power generation cycles, the
obtained cold energy through the regasification can be utilized as a
heat sink [5,16]. Also, for other applications the LNG cold energy has
been utilized to provide the required cold energy, like cryogenic air
separation unit [17,18] and seawater desalination [19]. For genera-
tion of 240 kWh of electrical power near one ton of LNG is consumed
[20]. Before the gasification, it is better to increase pressure of the
LNG to the required pressure for transportation or various usages of
the produced natural gas. Because if regasification is carried out at
low pressure, the produced natural gas pressure must be increased
by a compressor which its required power is much more than the
pump [21]. Outlet natural gas pressure in LNG vaporization termi-
nals depends on the downstream process (Table 1) [22].

Temperature difference between the LNG and ambient air (or sea
water) is about 182 K. So there is considerable cold energy source
which can be recovered by two basic methods: using the cold energy
directly and electrical power generation. Direct cold energy

applications are in food freezing [23], producing dry ice [24], air con-
ditioning [25], intake air cooling [26], high purity ozone production
[27], ethylene separation [28], rubber cryogenic girding [29], desali-
nation of sea water [30], boil off gas re-liquefaction [31], low tem-
perature crushing [32], CO2 liquefaction [33] and solidification, air
liquefaction [34] producing: nitrogen, oxygen, argon, hydrogen, etc.
The required refrigeration in all of the considered processes is pro-
vided from LNG vaporization process. Using LNG cold energy
improves the overall energy efficiency and process performance.
Importance of using the potential in the LNG regasification process
has already been investigated. At the first work presented by G(cid:2)omez
et al. [35] the current state of the thermodynamic cycles that exploit
the released exergy during LNG regasification is reviewed, with the
objective of improving power plant efficiency.

In the same way, in an up-to-date review work by Kanbur et al.
[2], LNG cold utilization systems like separation processes, cold food
storage, cryogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) capture, and power genera-
tion are reviewed. Also, selection of working fluids in the electrical

power generation cycles along with economic and environmental
aspects of LNG cold utilization systems are discussed.

Although various processes have been proposed to improve effi-
ciency of the thermal cycles by using LNG cold energy, there is still a
long way to obtain better benefit from this feature and propose new
ways to enhance the efficiency of these cycles. So, it is needed to
review all existing applications of LNG cryogenic energy, classify
them and analyze the limitations and efficiency of them. The main
feature of this paper is classification of conventional/unconven-
tional, single/combined cycles that have been proposed in the LNG
vaporization processes up to 2018. Selection of the working fluid is
another key parameter which is reviewed in this paper. Effects of
the inlet and outlet thermodynamic parameters and their limitations
are analyzed and discussed too. For evaluation and comparison of
different processes, reasonable definitions for energy and exergy
efficiencies are defined. Also key parameters that show the best fea-
tures of the LNG vaporization for electrical power generation cycles,
cold recovery, etc., are determined.

2. Electrical power generation cycles by using cold energy of LNG

Four types of electrical power generation cycles are generally
used for power generation; Rankine, Brayton, Diesel, and Otto cycles.
Rankine cycle is mostly used in base load power plants (base load
power sources are those plants that can generate power in order
to meet the demand) [36]. Brayton cycle is used in peak shaving
(a technique that is used to reduce power consumption during peri-
ods of maximum demand on the power utility) applications [37].
Finally, Otto and Diesel cycles have driven engine generators which

are used in small power generation applications. Atienza-M(cid:2)arquez
et al. [38] analyzed a polygeneration plant for cold recovery of lique-
fied natural gas regasification. This process has high energy effi-
ciency of 34.7%.

2.1. Organic Rankine cycles based designs

A Rankine type power generation cycle which uses organic fluids
as the working fluids is known as organic Rankine cycle. Boiling
point of the ORC working fluid is lower than the conventional type
of the Rankine cycles which utilize water as the working fluid. At
low operating temperature of the cycle, organic fluids results higher
efficiency [39]. Figs. 1 and 2 illustrate schematic diagram of some
basic and combined Rankine cycles. These figures show that Rankine
cycle performance can be improved by adding some features such as
regeneration and combining two cycles. Using geothermal heat
source is another approach to increase the cycle efficiency.

ORCs are currently used in various industrial low grade heat
applications including renewable energy systems. Some applications
include geothermal power plants as shown in Figs. 1d and 3b, other
applications include: solar thermal power systems, organic Rankine

cycle using solar energy and reverse osmosis desalination hybrid
system, Duplex-Rankine systems, energy conversion systems, ocean
thermal energy, biomass power plants, applications of waste heat
recovery [43] and hybrid application in the form of ORC-absorption
technology [44(cid:1)46].

Different types of the Rankine cycles which uses LNG cold energy
have been investigated. An electrical power generation cycle with
LNG cold energy as the heat sink which operates with low grade
waste heat is analyzed and optimized considering key thermody-
namic design parameters [47]. Szargnt et al. [48] suggested three dif-
ferent cryogenic power plants and studied the influence of ambient
temperature variation on the efficiency. Habibi et al. [49] analyzed a
solar-driven ammonia-water Rankine cycle utilizing LNG cold
energy. Deng et al. [50] proposed a CO2 cycle which utilizes LNG cold
energy as the heat sink. This cycle supply an oxygen stream from the
air separation unit (ASU). Zhang et al. [51] studied a novel combined
ORC system with LNG as the heat sink for better conversion of low-
temperature waste heat. Le et al. [52] investigated a direct expansion
configuration of ORC cycle for recovery of the pressure energy. The
results show that the total recovered energy can generate 1.7 GWh
electricity annually. Lee et al. [53] carried out a thermodynamic

assessment of LNG-FSRU vessel in three different schemes in order
to generate power from the LNG cold energy and the heat from the
exhaust gas during the process of regasification. The results show
that the new proposed system has better efficiency. Four exergy
recovery systems which utilize LNG as a low temperature heat sink
to produce electric power are investigated and analyzed [54]. These
systems include direct expansion and ORC cycles. The analyzed sys-
tems exergetic efficiencies ranging from 20% to 36% with net output
work ranging from 214 to 380 kJ/kgLNG.

Li et al. [55] proposed an integrated combined Rankine and
direct-expansion system in the LNG receiving terminal. Capacity of
the system is about 61.5 kW per ton of LNG. Energy and exergy effi-
ciencies were reported 42.3% and 64.2%, respectively. Zhang et al.
[15] investigated a novel CO2 oxy-fuel power generation cycle with
LNG cold energy utilization with CO2-capturing (see Fig. 3a). Also
effect of some key operating parameters such as turbine inlet tem-
perature (TIT) and back pressure on the process performance were
analyzed, Liu et al. [16] nominated a novel cryogenic power genera-
tion cycle which uses a binary mixture working fluid integrated with
LNG cold energy recovery. Hadid et al. [56] investigated different
systems including Brayton cycles and ORCs to find the best engine-
cycle architectures with respect to overall exergy destruction mini-
mization. Different working fluids were also investigated. The results
show that ethane Rankine cycle has the best overall exergy effi-
ciency. The cycle with the best energy and exergy efficiencies is
nitrogen Brayton cycle. Wang et al. [47] proposed a cascade power
generation cycle; consist of a Rankine cycle which uses ammonia
and water mixture as the working fluid and a power cycle which

combustion gas is used to recover LNG cold energy. Effect of thermo-
dynamic parameters on the process operating performance was
examined. Liu et al. [5] presented a thermodynamic analysis and
optimization of high efficiency cogeneration system, which uses
LNG cold energy with zero CO2 and other emissions. Thermody-
namic sensitivity analysis of unconstrained variables which have sig-
nificant effect on the thermal performance of the cycle is studied.
Szargut et al. [48] investigated the possibilities of the LNG cold
energy usage for electrical power generation. Griepentrog et al. [57]
proposed the LNG regasification in supercritical pressure where the
heat is exchanged by using the N2-cycle. Bisio et al [58] proposed
combination of the gas turbine cycle and LNG cold energy. In this
cycle nitrogen as the working fluid is cooled after expansion and
between the compression stages. The most part of exergy destruc-
tion occurs at LNG regasification process and heating the working
fluid before entering the gas turbine. Jo et al. [3] developed a novel
energy transport system for district cooling application by using
absorption cycles. In this paper LNG cold energy is used as heat sink
of the condenser and rectifier with parametric analysis. Chio et al.
[59] proposed a cascade Rankine power generation cycle with LNG
cold energy recovery with optimization of the key parameters for
better performance of the cycle. Also energy and exergy efficiencies,
and economic parameters of the proposed cycle were compared
with convectional case studies. The results show that three stage
cascade Rankine cycle with propane as the working fluid is better
than other configurations of the cascade Rankine cycle in terms of
the net power output, energy and exergy efficiencies. But life cycle
cost (LCC) is higher due to more complicated configuration and

operation. The process configurations are shown in Figs. 3a, 4a and b.
There are also other researches about the use of ORC. Yuanwei et al.
[60] utilized thermodynamic diagram for performance analysis of a
two cascade Rankine cycle for electrical power generation based on
the LNG regasification operating parameters. Song et al. [61] pro-
posed a transcritical CO2 power generation cycle which uses solar
heat and LNG cold energies. Thermodynamic analysis of some key
parameters reveals that the net electrical power output depends on
the solar radiation during hours of a day and also the overall energy
efficiency can reach to about 6.51% under the given condition. Angel-
ino et al. [12] proposed a CO2 power cycle which uses LNG as the
heat sink with thermodynamic analysis for suggesting CO2 cycles
with simpler configuration, higher efficiencies and cheaper turbo
machinery. Also similar results were analyzed with Brayton cycle.
Ferreira et al. [62] performed analyses to provide guidelines for deci-
sion-making on upgrading LNG regasification terminals. They have
considered a simple Rankine cycle with various working fluids to
maximize net electric efficiency. They concluded that upgrading the
system and the heat exchange can save 830 kW. Astolfi et al. [63]
investigated an ORC for LNG regasification plants. Different cycle
configurations are investigated, along with adoption of many work-
ing fluids and different design constraints. The results show that
ORC cycle can be effective in both decreasing the operating costs of
the plant and pollutant emission. Kaczmarek et al. [64] analyzed
operation of an ORC cycle using a low-temperature heat source. The
results show high average efficiency of 30% for the system. Sun et al.
[65] analyzed and compared three different ORC cycle configura-
tions: PTORC(parallel two-stage ORC), SORC(single-stage ORC) and
CTORC (cascade two-stage ORC) with the purpose of finding the best
configuration. The results show that CTORC is more suitable for

higher heat source temperatures and PTORC performs better in low
grade heat sources.

In recent decades, the most usage of the LNG cold energy is for
increasing efficiency of the electrical power generation cycles by
using LNG as a heat sink [40,50,55,57,58,61,66(cid:1)90]. The obtained
results show improvements in the organic Rankine cycle efficiency
by using LNG cold energy to condense the working fluid. A compari-
son between some thermodynamic parameters of Rankine cycle
against Brayton cycle was also studied [50].

2.2. Brayton cycle based designs

The gas turbine cycle is known as the Brayton cycle or sometimes
the Joule Cycle. Some other processes that utilize Brayton cycle as
the thermodynamic cycle of vaporization process and cold energy
recovery of LNG are as follows:

Angelino et al. [91] proposed a Brayton cycle for recovering LNG
physical exergy. Some discussions about the effective parameters in
the Brayton cycles which use cold energy of LNG can be found in
[84,85,92(cid:1)94]. Fig. 5 shows different features used in Brayton cycles
such as cooling air inlet, direct expansion and intercooling.

Open and closed Brayton combined cycles were suggested by
[96(cid:1)99]. In the closed Brayton, LNG cold energy cycle is use as a
heat sink. Figs. 6 and 7 show combined Brayton cycle schemes.

2.3. Stirling cycle based designs

Stirling cycles can use different working fluids such as gaseous
and magnetic materials. The cycle performance characteristics
depend on the working fluids. Dong et al. [101] investigated a simple

LNG cold power generation process that uses seawater and LNG as
the heat sink and Stirling cycle as its heat source. Fig. 8 show the
basic scheme of Stirling cycle. Stirling engine can be used for conver-
sion of LNG cryogenic exergy into the electricity [102]. In this study
parameters of the vaporization process and power cycle are also
investigated. The results show that to increase the process perfor-
mance, a high temperature heat source like exhaust gas should be
used and LNG evaporation pressure and mass flow rate should be
controlled in an acceptable range. Finally, the combined Stirling
cycle with air liquefaction which uses LNG cold energy is proposed.

2.4. Combined cycle based designs

Simple cycles are affected by high fuel prices and low efficiencies,
however combined cycles generally utilize the waste heat that
comes out of the exhaust in order to improve the cycle efficiency. As
a result, efficiency of the combined cycles increases to 50%, which is
much higher than the conventional cycles. In some cases, the cycle
uses supplementary firing in a waste HRSG boiler, such as the cycle
shown in Fig. 9. One approach to form a new thermodynamic cycle
is to combine different conventional cycles together. The most popu-
lar way is combination of Rankine and Brayton cycles. Figs. 10 and 11
illustrate some of the basic and binary schemes of the combined
cycles, respectively.

Various types of thermal integration of power plants with the

LNG vaporization process are as follows [104]:

(cid:3) Secondary working fluid closed cycle
(cid:3) NG direct expansion system
(cid:3) Integration of LNG cold energy with a combined power plant

Some works about combined cycles using LNG cold energy to
improve efficiency of the conventional cycles are proposed: Gomez
et al. [105] suggest an electrical power plant consists of a closed
Brayton cycle and steam Rankine cycle. LNG cold energy decreases
Helium temperature in a closed Brayton cycle at the compressor suc-
tion as well as for electrical power generation through direct expan-
sion. From the sensitivity analysis, the maximum overall efficiency is
about 56.7% with a specific power of 2.84 MW/ (kg.s¡1) of LNG.
Querol et al. [92] investigated a new combined cycle consisting of a
gas turbine and Rankine cycle with a pure NH3 as the working fluid
integrated with LNG regasification system. Kanbur et al. [106] inves-
tigated a novel system combining a Stirling engine and a micro gas
turbine that utilizes LNG cold energy. It is found that the proposed

system has higher energy and exergy efficiencies by 1% and 2.4%,
respectively. Shi et al. [26] proposed an integrated thermal power
plant with the intake air cooling and compressor inlet stream cool-
ing to improve the performance of the convectional combined power
plant. Qiang et al. [40] investigated a power plant with natural gas
directly expanding with LNG cold recovery and using low-grade
heat source. Kanbur et al. [107] investigated single and combined
systems with LNG used as a cold source. Single system includes
micro turbine integrated with a LNG vaporizer while the combined
system consists of a Stirling engine and a thermal energy storage
tank in addition to the microturbine and LNG cold utilization system.
The results show that the combined system is more efficient and
sustainable than the single system. Morosuk et al. [100] developed a
new cogeneration system which uses LNG cold energy and studied
application of the advanced exergy based analysis to a recently
developed cogeneration system with LNG cold recovery. The impor-
tance of the N2 subsystem in improving the overall system is identi-
fied and advantages of splitting thermodynamic inefficiencies, cost
and environmental impacts are demonstrated by unavailable and
avoidable parts. Ghaebi et al. [108] investigated a novel ammonia-
water combined cooling and power system using LNG cold energy as
thermal heat sink. The results show that the novel cycle has high
first-law and second-law efficiencies of 43.25% and 22.51%, respec-
tively. Lu et al. [109] proposed a cascade Rankine power cycle with
ammonia/water as the working fluid and a combustion gas power

cycle with LNG direct expanding and cold recovery. Effect of operat-
ing parameters on the energy and exergy efficiencies and optimiza-
tion of the cascade power cycle were investigated. Mehrpooya et al.
[110] investigated a cascading power cycle with LNG regasification
process by advanced exergoeconomic method. Exergy efficiency of
the system is 59.49%.

Zhang et al. [111] proposed a new gas turbine cycle with LNG
regasification which uses CO2 as the working fluid and natural gas as
the fuel in a combustion chamber with 65.0% thermal efficiency.
Bisio et al. [22] established a closed cycle with nitrogen as the work-
ing fluid with LNG cold energy recovery. The results thermodynamic
optimization reveals that the best configuration includes three cas-
cade cycles with steam, propane and LNG as the working fluids.

Kim et al. [95] proposed gas/steam combined power plants using
intake air cooling and LNG cold energy to increase electrical power
output during hot seasons of the year.

Other applications of LNG in combined cycles

includes:
Hisazumiet al. [103] applied LNG cold energy in power generation
systems which uses geothermal, solar and wind energies. The sys-
tem consists of a Rankine cycle which uses freon and natural gas
mixture as the working fluid and a combined cycle with gas and
steam turbines. Rao et al. [112] described a novel combined cycle
which includes solar driven organic Rankine cycle and LNG electrical
power generation, also comparative analysis between the proposed
cycles and separated ones was done. The obtained results reveal that
solar collector and heat exchangers total area for the combined cycle
is smaller than the separated cases.

Gomez et al. [113] presented a novel power plant including a
closed Brayton cycle and a Rankine cycle which have been integrated
in series with respect to the flue gases. In the Brayton cycle, instead of
a convectional combined cycle, LNG cold energy is used to cool the
compressor inlet stream, thereby increases its thermal efficiency.

An analysis on the power plants which uses different kind of the
working fluids is carried out. The results show that for the closed
Brayton cycle with Helium and the Rankine cycle with CO2 at specific
power of 2.4654 MW/ (kg.s¡1) of LNG, thermal and overall efficiencies
are 67.6% and 53.13%, respectively. Fig 12a and b illustrate combined
Rankine cycles with two direct cycle and cascade cycle, respectively.

Wang et al. [80] defined a combined cycle which uses low tem-
perature waste heat and LNG cold energy as well. The results show
that maximum energy and exergy efficiencies are about 39.3% and
55.6%, respectively. Zahng et al. [114] proposed a LNG regasification
process integrated with combined gas turbine cycle and CO2

cold energy recovery [41]. With permission from Elsevier, Copyright(cid:1) 2018.

capturing. The cold energy of LNG is recovered for power generation
and CO2 emissions are reduced. Effects of the thermodynamic
parameters on the cycle performance which are working fluid mass
flow rate ratio, low pressure turbine inlet temperature and pressure
were analyzed. Shi et al. [115] presented a combined power plant in
which waste heat and LNG cold energy are utilized. The process con-
sists of Rankine cycle with an ammonia/water mixture and LNG
[116,117] presented an
power generation. Tsatsaronis et al.
advanced exergy analysis of a novel cogeneration concept that com-
bines LNG regasification with electrical power generation in a closed
Brayton and open gas turbine cycles which use nitrogen and air as
the working fluids. Dispenza et al. [118] nominated an innovative
process which uses LNG cold energy in an improved combined heat
and power plant with performance analysis based on the thermody-
namic and economic aspects.

Production of electrical power and cooling from the LNG regasifi-
cation is studied by Mena et al. [119]. The results show that the sys-
tem efficiency can be improved by utilizing LNG cold energy
significantly.

Blagin et al. [120] performed a comparative analysis on four differ-
ent schemes which uses LNG cold energy to realize which power
plant has the most effective performance. Based on their studies, the
plant which utilizes thermal compression in tank and turbine circuit,
is the most effective scheme because of its reduced specific work.
Invernizzi et al. [121] investigated different closed power cycles with
the purpose of finding the most efficient cycle to use LNG cold energy.
The results show that Brayton cycles can perform really better, with
an almost full use of liquefied natural gas available cold energy. ORC
cycles also performs in a very satisfactory way. Mahmoudi et al. [122]
studied an integrated MCFC and ORC power cycle using LNG as a heat
sink. Efficiency and product cost are assessed as the decision parame-
ters in this study. The results show that the highest exergy destruction
rate occurs in the catalytic burner. Sadaghiani et al. [123] proposed a
novel combined power generation plant consisting two ORCs and a
Kalina power cycle with LNG as the heat sink. The results show that
energy and exergy efficiencies of the process are 13.25% and 26.13%,
respectively.

Including the use of combined cycle based designs and consider-
ing the inverted Brayton cycle limitations, this has the potential of
converting the exhaust waste heat energy to the useful work. In
integration of gas turbine as a topping cycle and
this regard,
inverted Brayton cycle as the bottom cycle is proposed [124].

gated.

2.5. The other applications of LNG regasification

Many studies about more effective ways to use LNG cold energy
for other applications have been conducted. Xia et al. [130] pre-
sented a solar driven transcritical CO2 power generation cycle for

reverse osmosis desalination based on the cold energy recovery of
LNG. The system consist of solar collector plates, a transcritical CO2
power cycle, reverse osmosis desalination and a LNG cold energy
recovery. The daily exergy efficiency can reach 4.09% with providing
2537.33 m3 fresh water per day. He et al. [131] proposed a novel
conceptual design for hydrate based desalination process which uti-
lizes LNG cold energy. The results show that the novel design can be
an energy efficient desalination system for water desalination.

Ahmadi et al. [132] studied a transcritical CO2 cycle coupled to
LNG as the heat sink to enhance the electricity generation. The results

show that exergy efficiency and product cost rate of the process are
20.5% and 263,592.15 $/year respectively. Roszak et al. [133] pro-
posed a novel concept of hybridization of LNG regasification cycle
and absorbed natural gas tanks filling process. The obtained latent
heat from LNG regasification is used for pre-cooling the absorbed
natural gas bed which removes the use of gas compressors and
improves competitiveness of the absorbed natural gas storage
method. Based on the LNG regasification process operating pressure
and the adsorbent temperatures, the overall exergy efficiency can
reaches to 24%. Ghaebi et al. [134] investigated a novel trigeneration
system using LNG as the cold source and geothermal energy as the
heat source. Thermal and exergy efficiencies of the novel system are
85.92% and 18.52%, respectively. Life cycle-based thermal analysis of

the inlet air-cooled microturbine systems using LNG cold energy
recovery is investigated [135]. The results show that the life cycle-
based environmental payback periods for such systems are 3.25%,
7.77% and 2.47% less than old systems because of lower emission
reductions. Ahmadi et al. [136] investigated a transcritical CO2 power
cycle driven by solar energy and cold energy of LNG. A parametric
study was carried out on the performance of the system to find key
parameters affecting the system performance. An overall thermal
efficiency of 10.55% could be obtained for the system.

A novel hybrid liquid air energy storage system utilizing LNG cold
energy is introduced by Zhang et al. [137]. The proposed system has
the benefit of easy realization and stability. Electricity storage effi-
ciency of the system was reported 70%.

Dispenza et al. [118] proposed a modular power cycle which is
suitable for multipurpose usage of cold energy. In this process ethane
or ethylene are used as the working fluid. Rocal et al. [11, 23] pro-
posed a modular power cycle which uses ethane as the working fluid
and integrated with LNG regasification unit. Also, providing CO2 circu-
lation system in a novel service loop to transfer cold energy. In
another implementation of LNG cold energy as the heat sink, Kyong Jo
et al. [3] developed a new energy transport system for district cooling
application by using second type of the absorption cycles with
parametric analysis. LNG cold energy is utilized as the heat sink of the
condenser and the rectifier in the Kalina cycle [128], (see Fig. 13).
Ghaebi et al. [138] studied a novel cascade Kalina cycle utilizing LNG
cold energy. The system uses geothermal energy as the heat source.
Some key parameters are studied to improve the system efficiency.

Following discussion about using cold energy from LNG regasifi-
cation process, some researchers have studied using the cold energy
in liquid air separation plants. Xing et al. [139] introduced and simu-
lated an air separation unit (ASU) by using the LNG cold energy to
produce high pressure and pure oxygen and liquid nitrogen. The
result shows that energy consumption of
the proposed ASU
decreases about 58.2% compared to a conventional air separation
unit. Kim et al. [140] utilized LNG cold energy in a single-column
ASU to lower specific energy consumption. Mehrpooya et al. [141]
performed an advanced exergoeconomic analysis on a novel ASU.

The results show that compressors in the process have priorities for
modification. Esfilar et al. [142] investigated an integrated biomass
and coal co-gasification, cryogenic ASU with LNG cold energy. The
results show that the system can save significant amount of energy.
Wendong et al. [143] proposed a novel ASU which uses LNG
cold energy based on high efficiency of the chemical packing sepa-
ration and heat exchanger. The results show that consumption of
LNG and power decreases 44.2% and 21.5 kW/hr respectively.
Mehrpooya et al. [144] studied a novel integrated system includ-
ing ASU, SOFC and CO2 transcritical cycle with LNG regasification
to provide the required refrigeration. Nakaiwa et al. [145] pro-
posed a high performance energy supply system by using LNG
cold energy. Advantage of this system is that the pollutant emis-
sions in the exhaust decreases. Tesch et al. [146] evaluated two
options of integrating the regasification of LNG into the ASU.
These two designs are analyzed separately and the benefits of
each design is discussed. In [147] possibilities of integration of
LNG regasification into an ASU are developed, considering differ-
ent possible structures of the ASUs. The results show that new
concepts are less expensive and more reliable.

Applying LNG cold energy in the cryogenic energy storage (CES)
system is studied by Park et al. [148]. They optimized the power con-
sumption and generation in order to enhance the storage efficiency.
As a result, the reserve margin of the model is improved to 21.4%.

Lee et al. [149,150] developed an efficient CES process which uses
the recovered exergy from the LNG regasification process. The pro-
posed system has the advantage of storing and releasing energy
simultaneously.

Among other applications of using LNG cold energy, Aspelund
et al. [151(cid:1)153] presented a novel energy transport chain of natural
gas for power generation with CO2 capturing and storage including
an offshore section, a combined gas carrier and an integrated receiv-
ing terminal. Compared to a convectional LNG chain with and with-
out CO2 capturing, thermal efficiency reached to 42.0% and 49.5%,
respectively, such as those shown in Figs. 14 and 15. Sun et al. [130]
studied a solar transcritical CO2 power generation cycle for hydrogen
production with LNG cold energy utilization to condense the CO2.
Results of the exergy analyses indicate that both of the solar and

LNG equally provide hot and cold energies of the CO2 power genera-
tion cycle. Largest amount of the exergy destruction occurs in the
solar plate collector and condenser due to the great temperature dif-
ferences in the heat transfer process. With optimizing the turbine
inlet pressure and other operating parameters, 11.5 kW of cold
exergy and 2.1 L/s of hydrogen is provided. Exergy efficiency of the
hydrogen production can reach to 12.4%. Hydrogen production with
LNG cold energy utilization to condense the CO2 is shown in Fig. 16a
and b [154]. Wang et al. [155] studied application of LNG cold energy
as the heat sink in a thermal energy storage system. The results show
that by this method the round trip efficiency of the system can reach
to 139%.

Two of the goals listed above are pointed out by Stougie et al.
[156] who applied both of the above mentioned processes for using

the LNG cold energy. Basic scheme of one column configuration ASU
is shown in Fig. 17.

LNG cold energy can be used in the fuel cell systems such as

SOFC-GT-ORC integrated processes as shown in Fig. 18.

In the electric power generation, a LNG stream is used as the heat
sink in the CHP plant [26,111]. For example, integration of LNG with
inlet air cooling of the gas turbine [157,158], or condenser of steam
turbine system, etc. [48,159]. In another utilization, cold energy of
LNG is recovered in the regasification terminals for various purposes
In these studies, the required cold energy for
[11,21,23,82,84].

industrial and commercial applications in the proper temperature
range is provided from the regasification unit. Subramanian et al.
[120] investigated technical and economical feasibility of using LNG
cold energy for space-cooling in Singapore. The results show tre-
mendous benefits both in energy saving and reducing the environ-
mental pollution. In another study [133] the obtained latent heat of
LNG regasification is directly used for pre-cooling of the absorbed
natural gas adsorption bed. Some other applications of LNG cold
energy utilization are: two column configuration cryogenic ASU
liquid nitrogen production [161(cid:1)163], CO2
[160] (see Fig. 19),

increasing the turbine outlet pressure decreases exergy and thermal
efficiency [115,178(cid:1)180]. Turbine inlet temperature has a direct
incremental effect on exergy and thermal efficiencies of the cycles
and improves them [176,178,181,182], also improves gas turbine
efficiency [145].

Researchers also have studied other parameters and their effects.
Turbine inlet pressure and heat source temperature improve net
electrical efficiency [115,178], turbine outlet pressure decreases net
electrical efficiency [80,115,178]. Maximizing gas turbine pressure
improves output power [176,177,183]. Turbine outlet pressure has
decreasing effect on output power of the cycle. Net electrical and
exergy efficiencies decreases with turbine outlet pressure [26].
Ahmadi et al. proposed a waste heat recovery system for PEM fuel
cell [184]. The results show that the produced power by CO2 and

[151(cid:1)153,161,166,167], solar hybrid gas turbine [168] (see Fig. 20),
recovery of natural gas liquids from LNG [169] and water desalina-
tion [86,170(cid:1)173].

Regarding to the advantages and disadvantages of the suggested
processes energy and exergy analysis can be useful for comparing
their performances. In this paper, depending on the thermodynamic
cycle, exclusive definition of energy and exergy efficiencies for inte-
grated processes with different thermodynamic cycles and configu-
rations of equipment, economic potential, profitability and process
complexity are reviewed. At the end, the conclusions including max-
imum cold recovery, minimum energy consumed and optimum
energy and exergy efficiencies are also proposed and discussed.

3. Effect of LNG thermodynamic parameters on the cycle
performance

Parameters like operating pressure and temperature of the cycle
components are of great importance because they affect efficiency
and other features. Increasing the turbine inlet pressure improves
exergy and thermal efficiency of the cycles [40,115,174(cid:1)177],

expansion process

LNG cycles increases with inlet pressure of CO2 turbine. Net electri-
cal output power improves when temperature of the cycle in its
high temperature section increases [176,181]. Other researchers
have studied stack gas temperature changes by gas turbine inlet
temperature and the results show that the relation between these
two parameters is almost linear with positive slope [127]. Heat to
power efficiency of the cycle also improves by increasing the tem-
perature and pressure of the proposed power generation cycle [160].

4. Conceptual design

Vaporization processes with different input pressures were
examined in order to determine the amount of available net exergy
according to inlet pressure of the LNG (Table 2). Fig. 21 illustrates
schematic overview of vaporization process in various inlet pres-
sures.

From Fig. 22, it can be seen that temperature of the inlet LNG to
the vaporization process increases with the pressure, while ratio of
the total exergy to the pump power decreases.

From Fig. 23, it is concluded that rate of the heat capacity which

implies recoverable cold energy of LNG increases with pressure.

LNG is used to cool down the gas to cryogenic temperatures at
the compressor inlet. This point decreases the specific volume of the
gas and thereby reduces the compression power and consequently
increases the cycle net power [105].

5. Working fluid

Selection of the working fluid is very important issue in perfor-
mance of the thermodynamic cycles. Working fluids must have spe-
cial features to be suitable for various cycles. Choosing the right
working fluid can greatly affect efficiency of the system [185], design
of the expansion machine, size of the equipment, stability of the sys-
tem [186] and power plant cost [187].

5.1. Categories

The working fluids can be classified into three different types
based on their characteristic in the T-S vapor saturation diagram:
wet and dry fluids which have negative and positive slope, respec-
tively and also isentropic fluid with large slope [185,186,188]. Wet
fluids with steep curves in the T-S vapor saturation diagram provide

a better performance and larger energy efficiencies than dry ones
[188].

5.2. Thermodynamic and physical properties

Properties of a working fluid that affect organic Rankine cycles
economic and thermodynamic performance are as follows: vapori-
zation and condensation latent heat, specific heat, density, boiling
temperature, freezing point, molecular weight, molecular complex-
ity, viscosity and conductivity [186,189].

5.3. Selection

The following principles are important through choosing the
working fluid: safe and environmental friendly [181], non-toxic,
non-corrosive and available at a reasonable cost [91], high specific
refrigeration production per unit of mass flow rate, low viscosity,
good heat transfer performance, proper evaporation and condensa-
tion pressures, safety [176], enough chemical stability in the desired
temperature range, non-flammable [177], low specific and high vol-
ume, moderate pressures in the heat exchangers, low ODP and low
GWP among other working fluids [190], fluid stability and its com-
patibility with other materials, availability and health aspects [39],
miscibility of the components and suitable temperature glides
[191,192], positive or isentropic saturation vapor curve [193]. Also
working fluid critical temperature should not be greater than
¡160 oC [91]. Selection of working fluid is a more complicated task
because of many different working conditions and heat sources
[186]. The best way to select a suitable working fluid is based on
equality of the levelized cost of energy [189].

5.4. Limitations

Limitations of choosing the working fluids include: limitations of
the pressure of condensation and evaporation in the literature, limi-
tation of the highest temperature for decomposition, limitation for
the expansion machines, limitations considering safety and the envi-
ronment [186]. Because of growing environmental concerns, some
working fluids have been put aside, like R-11, R-12, R-113, R-114,
and R-115, while some other working fluids are going to be put aside
in next decades (such as R-21, R-22, R-123, R-124, R-141b and R-
142b). The primary selection phase of the working fluids does not
include the first group [194].

5.5. Diagrams

Effect of using eight different working fluids in a combined ORC
power cycle on output parameters such as power production, effi-
ciency, etc. is studied [177,190]. The results show that Isopentane or
R123 are the best possible choices. Thermal efficiency variation with
temperature for various working fluids is investigated [185]. The
results show that working fluids with low critical temperature have
lower thermal efficiency. Also exergy efficiency of various working
fluids is studied [191]. Angelino et al. [195] investigated the effect of
various concentrations of ammonia on different output parameters,
like power production, efficiency, etc [196]. Changes of net power
output with different turbine inlet pressures [187] and temperature
evaporation [197] for various working fluids is investigated. Evapo-
ration temperature of the working fluid has a significant effect on
the net power output per unit mass of LNG and exergy efficiency
[198]. Stijepovic et al. [199] investigated working fluid properties
effect on the energy and exergy efficiencies and economics parame-
ters of the organic Rankine cycles.

5.6. Proposed working fluids for cycles

Table 3 shows some working fluids which are suitable for the

power cycles based on LNG cold utilization.

Minimum and maximum process temperature is a main parame-
ter which should be considered through selection of the working

fluid [39]. Helium, nitrogen and argon are proposed as the working
fluid of the closed Brayton cycle because of their ability to remain
stable at high temperatures and withstand at cryogenic tempera-
tures without freezing issues [182].

6. Exergy and energy efficiency relations

Exergy analysis can be implemented as a conventional tool for
evaluation of the LNG regasification processes. Exergy of a system is
the maximum attainable work that can be extracted when it
approaches the thermodynamic equilibrium with the surrounding
by reversible processes [200]. Equilibrium state means uniform tem-
perature and pressure conditions as well as density, chemical com-
position, gravitational and electromagnetic fields between the
reference state (surrounding) and the final state of the subsystem
[133]. Different types of the exergy can be defined such as; kinetic,
potential, mechanical, thermal, chemical and electrical [201]. Koku
et al. [104] addressed a conceptual study to investigate the techno-
economic feasibility of thermally integrating LNG cold energy in
power generation applications. They concluded that with LNG cold
energy as an energy efficient recycled resource, more energy effi-
cient and sustainable process can be achieved. Exergy concept is uti-
lized in analysis and optimization of performance of the LNG
regasification processes. Different studies about exergy analysis of
the natural gas liquefaction processes have been done [202,203]. In

natural gas boil off gas from gas in tankers is investigated. Exergy
analysis often is used with investigation of the combined LNG regasi-
fication processes like power generation [60,117,124] or utilization
of available refrigeration during the vaporization process [21].
Fig. 24 shows variation of the LNG physical exergy versus gasifica-
tion / storage pressure [133].

Table 4 show optimization potential of the LNG regasification
processes. A vaporization unit which operates at 1 bar is capable to
produce 1082.6 kJ external work per kg of LNG when the irreversibil-
ity is ignored. Utilization of practical phase change exergy causes to
recover 53.8 kJ entropy of free energy per kg of LNG [133].

At the moment, more than 90% of the LNG regasification units
operate without any mean of the exergy recovery concept. Devices
that vaporize LNG generate extra costs instead of being as a source
of supplementary income [133]. LNG cold energy recovery has some
difficulties in term of technology and the reason is that LNG vapori-
zation systems operate at low temperatures. Proposed systems must
be able to transform low temperature refrigeration to the form that
would be applicable in the practical applications, e.g. air condition-
ing and food storage [133]. Table 5 presents a brief summary of the
used equations for calculation of efficiency of the power cycles using
LNG cold energy.

7. Results and discussion

Tables 6(cid:1)10 present results of the energy and exergy analysis of
the discussed processes. Energy and exergy efficiency of the pro-
cesses can be calculated according to the given relations in Table 5.
In all of the considered processes, LNG cold energy is used as the
heat sink. Table 6 shows energy and exergy efficiency of the Rankine
cycles. The results indicate that the highest energy efficiency is
related to SOFC-GT-ORC (67%) and the highest exergy efficiency is
related to organic Rankine cycle with regenerator integrated with
cold recovery and direct expansion process (65.2%). The lowest
energy and exergy efficiencies are 8.48% (transcritical CO2 cycle),
and 7.95% (power generation using transcritical CO2 geothermal sys-
tem), respectively.

Tables 7 and 8 present results of the energy and exergy analysis
of the Brayton and Stirling cycles, respectively. The highest energy
efficiency is related to the closed Brayton cycle fueled by flue gas of
the natural gas combustion (63.63%) and the highest exergy effi-
ciency is related to the open Brayton cycle with regenerator (61.0%).
The lowest energy and exergy efficiencies are 11.9% for solar hybrid
gas turbine with LNG cooling system and 20.5% for Brayton cycle
with regenerator, respectively.

Table 9 shows results of the energy and exergy analysis of the
combined cycles. The highest energy and exergy efficiencies are
86.34% and 67.13%, respectively. The lowest energy and exergy effi-
ciencies are 13.4% for a novel combined cycle using mid and low

temperature heat recovery and 17.2% for combined cycle consisting
of a Rankine cycle without regeneration and a LNG Rankine cycle.

Table 10 shows results of the energy and exergy analysis of other
application processes. The highest energy efficiency is related to the
waste heat recovery for PEM fuel cell by using transcritical CO2 cycle
(72.36%) and the highest exergy efficiency is related to the cascade
utilization with LNG cold energy (80%). The lowest energy and
exergy efficiencies are 7.39%, 12.38% respectively, which is related to
production of hydrogen by a solar hybrid CO2 cycle with LNG regasi-
fication unit.

According to Figs. 25(cid:1)28, it is concluded that the combined cycle
has the highest energy and exergy efficiency compared to the other
cycles.

The reason is that usage of the available energy and exergy in the
process has been maximized by taking advantage of HSRG. With this
procedure it is possible to use waste heat of one process in another
one. Although the combined cycle efficiency is higher than other
cycles but organic Rankine cycle with direct expansion cycle as a
combined cycle has the lowest efficiency among them due to sim-
plicity. After the combined cycle, Rankine, Brayton and Stirling
cycles have different energy and exergy efficiencies due to their dif-
ferent structures. Rankine cycle with oxy-fuel process which utilizes
CO2 as the WF and ammonia-water organic cycle with heat recovery
vapor generation have the highest efficiency. It should be noted that
cascade Rankine cycle with two different WFs has high exergy effi-
ciency against energy efficiency because the produced power of the
cascade cycle is less than the single stage ones. Efficiency of the
improved Rankine and direct expansion power generation system is
the lowest among them, because of the large irreversibility and heat
lost in the process equipment. Improved Brayton cycles with heat
utilization system are competitive with Rankine cycle in some cases
and aspects. Although the Stirling cycle doesn't have significant effi-
ciency against the first three types, but due to the flexibility and sim-
plicity of the process, it has appropriate reflection. Unlike the power
cycles, the processes developed for cold transfer has the lowest effi-
ciency, because the main aim is supplying the required refrigeration.
The produced power in such processes is not considerable and irre-
versibility of the equipment is high. Using a more efficient working
fluid, process integration and utilization of the renewable energy
sources can improve the process performance.

8. Conclusions

Various kinds of the processes and methods which employ LNG
cold energy were analyzed and discussed. In order to use LNG cold
energy, conventional and non-conventional thermodynamic cycles
have been applied. For evaluation of the under consideration pro-
cesses reasonable relations for exergy and energy efficiencies were
developed. According to the results the highest energy efficiency
occurs in the combined cycles with the values of 86.34% (exchanging
heat with the Rankine cycle condenser). After the combined cycle,
other application usage (72.36%), Rankine (67%) and Brayton and
Stirling cycles (63.63%) have different energy efficiencies due to their
different configurations. Closed Brayton cycle fueled by the flue gas
has the lowest efficiency among the others. Exergy efficiency of
other application usage is the highest among the considered cycles
with the value of 80% (cascade utilization with LNG cold energy),
after other application usage, the combined cycles (67.13%), Rankine
(65.2%) and Brayton and Stirling cycles (61%) have the highest
exergy efficiencies, respectively. The lowest energy efficiency com-
pared to the other cycles occurs in other application cycles with the
value of 7.39% (i.e., production of hydrogen by a solar hybrid CO2
cycle with LNG regasification unit). Next, Rankine (8.48%), Brayton
and Stirling (11.9%) and combined cycles (13.4%) have different
energy efficiencies. Exergy efficiency of the Rankine cycle is the low-
est between the considered cycles with the value of 7.95% (i.e.,
power generation by using transcritical CO2 geothermal system),
after Rankine cycle, other application usage (12.38%), combined
cycle (17.2%) and Brayton and Stirling cycles (20.5%) have the lowest
exergy efficiencies, respectively.
