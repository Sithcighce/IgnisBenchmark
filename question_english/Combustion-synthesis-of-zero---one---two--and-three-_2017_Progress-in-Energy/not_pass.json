    "question_text": "Using the thermodynamic equation from the paper, explain how the adiabatic combustion temperature (Tad) is calculated for combustion synthesis systems and describe the physical meaning of each term. Then, analyze the TiO2 + 2Mg + kNaCl system specifically, explaining the combustion stability limits and experimental observations regarding particle size characterization across different k values, citing specific data from the provided text.",
    "standard_answer": "The adiabatic combustion temperature (Tad) is calculated using the fundamental thermodynamic energy balance equation: ΔHf,298 = ∫Tad298 Cp dt, where ΔHf,298 represents the enthalpy change from reactants to products at 298K and Cp is the sum of heat capacities of the reaction products. This equation expresses that the reaction enthalpy released equals the energy required to heat the products from room temperature to the adiabatic temperature. For the TiO2 + 2Mg + kNaCl system, the synthesis process exhibits specific stability behavior: 'For the TiO2 + 2Mg + kNaCl system, the synthesis process is stable for k = 0-1. For higher concentrations of NaCl (k>1), the combustion wave is extinguished. The Tc for k = 1 in this system is 1580 K.' Regarding particle size characterization, the paper provides specific experimental data: 'The average crystal size (r), estimated from the broadening of the X-ray peaks by Scherrer equation (r = Kλ/βcosθ, where r is the mean size of particles, nm; K is a dimensionless shape factor, which has a typical value of 0.9; λ is the X-ray wavelength, nm; β is the line broadening at half the maximum intensity (FWHM), in radians; and θ is the Bragg angle, in degrees) was in the 50-100 nm range.' This indicates consistent particle size distribution across different k values where combustion occurs, with no specific correlation between XRD peak broadening and k values mentioned in the provided text.",
