    "standard_answer": "Detecting and quantifying hydroperoxides in combustion faces challenges due to their high reactivity, lack of commercial availability, spontaneous exothermic decomposition, and limitations of conventional analytical tools like gas chromatography. Their instability necessitates careful synthesis and purification, while their reactive nature complicates transfer and analysis without degradation. Advanced diagnostics like synchrotron vacuum-ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry (SVUV-PIMS) overcome these by coupling molecular-beam sampling with tunable photoionization. Molecular-beam expansion rapidly quenches reactions, preserving reactive intermediates like hydroperoxides. SVUV-PIMS uses tunable VUV photons (8–10 eV) for soft ionization, minimizing fragmentation and enabling isomer-specific detection via photoionization efficiency curves. This allows direct measurement of hydroperoxide concentrations in reactors like jet-stirred reactors, providing quantitative data on species such as KHPs, alkyl hydroperoxides, and complex multi-oxygen hydroperoxides, crucial for validating kinetic models.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "Detection, identification, quantification, and thorough investigation of the kinetics of organic hydroperoxides are very challenging, mainly due to the lack of commercial availability of these reactive intermediates, the difficulties in their synthesis and purification due to their potential for spontaneous and exothermic decomposition, and the limitations of analytical tools (e.g., gas chromatography, GC).",
      "2": "In such a molecular beam – guided towards the ionization region of the mass spectrometer – all sampled molecules fly with basically the same velocity, precluding further collisions and reactions among its components, and the highly reactive species, like hydroperoxides, are preserved."

    "question_text": "How does the weak O–O bond dissociation energy in hydroperoxides influence their role in low-temperature hydrocarbon oxidation and autoignition?",
    "standard_answer": "The O–O bond in hydroperoxides has a significantly lower bond dissociation energy (BDE) of approximately 211 kJ/mol for hydrogen peroxide, compared to C–C (250–440 kJ/mol), C–H (350–590 kJ/mol), and C–O/O–H bonds (330–480 kJ/mol). This low BDE facilitates facile bond dissociation, generating reactive radical species that enhance chain branching in low-temperature oxidation. In alkane oxidation, hydroperoxides like ketohydroperoxides (KHPs) decompose via O–O bond cleavage, producing OH radicals and alkoxy radicals. This decomposition accelerates reactivity, triggering first-stage autoignition (cool flame) and second-stage ignition in internal combustion engines. The weak O–O bond enables hydroperoxides to act as key branching agents, promoting radical proliferation and reducing ignition delay times through cycles involving QOOH and OOQOOH radicals, ultimately governing the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) behavior and autoignition phenomena.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "The O–O single bond in hydroperoxides is substantially weaker than other single bonds of organic compounds. C–C bond dissociation energies (BDE) in organic compounds are most often between 250 and 440 kJ/mol and the BDEs for C–H bonds are between 350 and 590 kJ/mol. For C–O and O–H bonds, BDEs are in the range of 330–480 kJ/mol and 350–480 kJ/mol, respectively. In comparison, the BDE of the O–OH bond in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, the most stable hydroperoxide), is 211 kJ/mol.",
      "2": "These small BDEs of hydroperoxides enable bond dissociation and the formation of two radical species, leading to enhanced reactivity. As shown in Fig. 1, this easy bond dissociation has made hydroperoxides – especially ketohydroperoxides – the center of chemistry governing low-temperature oxidation and triggering autoignition in internal combustion engines."

    "standard_answer": "Ketohydroperoxides (KHPs) are central to chain branching in low-temperature alkane oxidation via a second propagating cycle (cycle 2). The process begins with H-abstraction from the fuel (RH) by OH radicals, forming alkyl radicals (R). These undergo O2 addition to form alkylperoxy radicals (ROO), which isomerize via internal H-atom transfer to produce hydroperoxyalkyl radicals (QOOH). A second O2 addition to QOOH yields hydroperoxyalkyl peroxy radicals (OOQOOH). Internal isomerization of OOQOOH, involving H-atom abstraction adjacent to the –OOH group, followed by rapid OH elimination, produces a KHP molecule and an OH radical. The KHP then decomposes unimolecularly via O–O bond cleavage, generating another OH radical and a ketoalkoxy radical. This sequence results in two OH radicals from one initial QOOH, significantly enhancing radical pool and reactivity. Competing pathways, such as QOOH dissociation to cyclic ethers (cycle 1), become less favorable at low temperatures, allowing KHPs to dominate branching and drive autoignition.",

The internal isomerization of this radical by abstracting the C–H adjacent to the –OOH group, followed by a rapid OH-elimination, yields a KHP molecule and an OH radical.",

    "standard_answer": "Ketohydroperoxides (KHPs) play a crucial role in two-stage fuel ignition in internal combustion engines through their formation and decomposition mechanisms. According to the paper, KHPs are formed through a specific reaction pathway involving a second oxygen addition to hydroperoxyalkyl radicals (QOOH). The paper states that 'the internal isomerization of this radical by abstracting the C–H adjacent to the –OOH group, followed by a rapid OH-elimination, yields a KHP molecule and an OH radical.' This formation mechanism is central to low-temperature combustion chemistry. The decomposition of KHPs further contributes to radical generation, as 'the further decomposition of KHPs results in another OH radical and a ketoalkoxyl radical.' This chain-branching effect accelerates reactivity by producing multiple reactive OH radicals. The paper emphasizes that 'they are responsible for two-stage fuel ignition in internal combustion engines,' confirming their fundamental role in the ignition process. The formation of KHPs through the second oxygen addition pathway and their subsequent decomposition into OH radicals creates a positive feedback mechanism that drives the ignition chemistry in engines.",
