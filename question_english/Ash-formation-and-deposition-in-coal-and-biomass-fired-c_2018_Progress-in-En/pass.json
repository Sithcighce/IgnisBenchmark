    "question_text": "Why is particle viscosity considered a key parameter for predicting the sticking behavior of silicate-rich ash particles during impaction on heat exchanger surfaces, and how does it influence energy dissipation mechanisms?",
    "standard_answer": "Particle viscosity is critical for silicate-rich ashes because it directly governs the energy dissipation during impaction, determining whether a particle sticks or rebounds. Upon impact, the particle's kinetic energy must be dissipated through viscous deformation work, surface energy changes, and elastic/plastic deformation. For silicate-rich particles, high viscosity (e.g., >10^5 Pa·s) resists flow, leading to insufficient energy dissipation and rebound, while lower viscosity (<10^4 Pa·s) allows viscous deformation to absorb kinetic energy, promoting sticking. The energy balance during impaction involves work against viscosity (W_viscous ∝ η * deformation_rate), which dominates over surface tension effects for molten droplets. The paper confirms that viscosity, calculated from temperature and composition-dependent models, is the primary factor in sticking criteria, as it quantifies the melt's ability to dissipate impact energy through internal friction, preventing elastic rebound.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "Particularly, the particle viscosity is confirmed as a key parameter for silicate-rich ashes. It should be calculated using temperature- and composition-dependent correlations, being aware that there is a significant scattering in the results from such models and that the models are often only valid in narrow compositional ranges, and cannot be used outside these.",
      "2": "These theoretical considerations show that the majority of depositing particles are dominated by the work of deformation against viscosity, rather than surface tension effects."

    "question_text": "How does the critical viscosity model differentiate between sticking and rebound of ash particles, and what are the limitations of applying viscosity-based criteria to salt-rich biomass ashes?",
    "standard_answer": "The critical viscosity model establishes a threshold viscosity (typically around 10^4 to 10^5 Pa·s) below which particles stick due to sufficient energy dissipation via viscous flow. For silicate-rich coal ashes, sticking occurs when viscosity is low enough to allow plastic deformation upon impact, absorbing kinetic energy. However, for salt-rich biomass ashes (e.g., high in K, Cl, S), viscosity is not the dominant stickiness parameter because these particles often have a solid phase with a liquid melt fraction. Their stickiness is better described by the liquid melt fraction criterion, where a critical melt fraction (e.g., 15-30%) must be exceeded for adhesion. Viscosity models fail for salt-rich ashes due to empirical correlations being valid only in narrow silicate compositional ranges and inability to capture the phase behavior of salts, which may form low-melting eutectics without significant viscosity reduction predictive by silicate models.",

    "standard_answer": "The paper identifies fundamental differences in ash particle chemistry between coal and biomass that significantly impact sticking behavior predictions. For silicate-rich coal ashes, particle viscosity is confirmed as the key parameter governing stickiness, and it can be calculated using temperature- and composition-dependent correlations. However, biomass ashes present greater challenges due to their different ash particle chemistry, particularly for salt-rich particles typical of herbaceous biomass and wood-based fuels. The stickiness of salt-rich biomass particles is controlled by the amount of liquid phase rather than viscosity alone. This fundamental difference in controlling mechanisms makes biomass ash stickiness more difficult to predict compared to coal ashes. The heterogeneity in biomass ash composition further complicates modeling efforts, as existing viscosity models are often only valid in narrow compositional ranges and cannot be reliably used outside these ranges. Additionally, the paper notes that there is significant scattering in results from viscosity prediction models, highlighting the need for improved approaches that model viscosity from chemical and physical structure rather than empirical fitting procedures.",

    "standard_answer": "Inertial impaction is a key ash deposition mechanism where particles with sufficient momentum deviate from fluid streamlines and impact surfaces. The paper states that 'Inertial impaction occurs when particles with sufficient inertia deviate from fluid streamlines and impact surfaces, dominating for larger particles in high-velocity flows near obstacles like tubes.' For silicate-rich ash particles, the sticking behavior upon impact is primarily governed by particle viscosity and kinetic energy. The paper emphasizes that 'the particle viscosity is confirmed as a key parameter for silicate-rich ashes' and that 'the sticking and rebound threshold is a function of the particle kinetic energy, the angle of impaction, and the particle viscosity.' During particle impaction, if all kinetic energy is dissipated through viscous deformation, the particle will remain on the surface. The paper explains that 'if all kinetic energy is dissipated during the impact, the particle will remain on the surface' and further notes that 'the majority of depositing particles are dominated by the work of deformation against viscosity, rather than surface tension effects.'

Describe how different surface conditions (molten layer vs. particulate deposit) influence particle capture according to the provided paper.",
    "standard_answer": "The energy-based sticking criterion states that if all kinetic energy is dissipated during impact, the particle will remain on the surface. This principle forms the foundation for understanding ash particle deposition in combustion systems. Particle kinetic energy (KE = 0.5 * m * v²) must be fully absorbed by the surface through various dissipation mechanisms for sticking to occur. The impact angle plays a crucial role because it determines the normal component of velocity that contributes to energy dissipation - shallow angles reduce the effective kinetic energy directed perpendicular to the surface, potentially increasing sticking likelihood. However, surface conditions dramatically alter this relationship. A molten surface layer will collect all impacting particles regardless of their stickiness due to capillary forces and the liquid nature of the surface, which provides continuous energy dissipation. In contrast, a particulate deposit behaves differently - it might capture incoming particles if their kinetic energy is low enough to be absorbed by the porous structure, but high-energy impacts can cause erosion and removal of existing deposit material. The paper emphasizes that surface structure and stickiness are crucial considerations for predicting deposition rates in solid fuel-fired systems, as the interaction between particle properties and surface characteristics determines whether particles stick, rebound, or cause erosion.",
