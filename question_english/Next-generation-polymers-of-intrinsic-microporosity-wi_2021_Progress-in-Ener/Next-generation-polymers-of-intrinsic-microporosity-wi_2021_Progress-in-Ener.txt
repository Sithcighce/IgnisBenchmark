Polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) with high free volumes have been synthesized by incorporat- 
ing contorted rigid moieties into polymers backbones. Despite their many appealing properties, mem- 
branes made of these polymers have not been used industrially because of their fast physical aging. The 
unprecedented CO 2 permeability and satisfactory CO 2 /N 2 and CO 2 /CH 4 selectivity of PIMs have led to es- 
tablishing the new 2019 upper bounds for the gas mixtures. This article reviews recent advances in the 
ﬁeld of PIM-based membranes. It discusses polymer synthesis strategies to modify PIM structures such 
that the resulting membranes have improved CO 2 separation performance and lower physical aging. The 
strategies include the use of monomers with suitable side chains, kinked moieties, and stable structures.

1. Introduction 

The  level  of  CO 

2  emission  has  been  increasing  globally  with 
industrialization  and  modernization.  More  than  50%  of  the  CO 
2 
is  released  by  the  electric  power,  chemical,  petrochemical,  and 
petroleum industries, as these industries still consume fossil fuels 
[ 1 , 2 ]. The importance of lowering CO 
2 emission is well-understood 
globally  [3–5] .  CO 
2  is  produced  in  enormous  amounts  as  a  side 
product  in  many  industries,  is  a  pollutant,  and  is  not  an  eco- 
nomic  chemical  precursor.  Thus,  there  are  major  environmental, 
economic, and operational incentives for separating CO 
2 from other 
gases right after its generation in an industrial process and for us- 
ing  it.  For  example,  CO 
2  has  been  injected  into  oil/gas  wells  to 
enhance oil/gas recovery [6] , reacted with metallic ions to obtain 
less soluble carbonates [7] , and fed to microorganisms [ 8 , 9 ]. Efforts 
to lower CO 
2 emission include improving the eﬃciency of the ex- 
isting fossil-fuel-consuming industrial plants, developing new eﬃ- 
cient, fossil-fuel-consuming industrial plants, replacing the current 
2 emitting alterna- 
CO 
tive, and introducing innovative cost-effective capture technologies 
[10–12] . 

2 emitting technologies with modern, less CO 

To decrease CO 

2 -capture methods 
2 emission, more eﬃcient CO 
are needed [ 13 , 14 ]. Absorption is currently the most widely used 
2 levels in natu- 
technology for gas sweetening [15–19] to lower CO 
ral gas, improving the heat value of natural gas, reducing pipeline 
corrosion, and preventing the operational inconvenience in chem- 
ical and petrochemical processes. While absorption has been used 
widely and is effective, it is a relatively expensive (in terms of both 
operating and capital costs), bulky, and diﬃcult-to-operate process. 
The operational diﬃculty is due to its susceptibility to foaming, en- 
trainment, and ﬂooding [14] . Alternatively, the membrane technol- 
ogy is modular and more compact, requires less energy, and has 
lower operating costs [20–26] . Furthermore, the membrane tech- 
nology can tolerate changes in a feed composition easily, as it does 

2 

not  involve  phase  change  or  solvent  regeneration  [27–29] .  Cur- 
rently the largest market for CO 
2 re- 
moval from natural gas. Emerging applications are the separation 
of CO 
2 [ 30 , 31 ]. The market has a lot of 
room to grow, as currently only 10% (by mass) of gases are sepa- 
rated using the membrane technology [32–36] .

Membranes formed from metals, ceramics [37–40] , zeolites, car- 
bon products, and polymers [41–44] all have shown great poten- 
tials for gas separation [45–50] . Currently, commercial membranes 
are mostly made from polymers. These membranes separate CO 
2 
according to the solution-diffusion mechanism [51–53] , which has 
three steps:  (a) permeant dissolution  in  the  membrane, (b)  per- 
meant  diffusion  through  the  membrane,  and  (c)  permeant  des- 
orption  on  the  other  side  of  the  membrane.  In  this  mechanism, 
the  permeant  concentration  gradient  across  a  membrane  gener- 
ates a chemical potential gradient [54] . Then the permeability of 
gas i in a polymer, P 
i , and 
L are the pressure differences across the membrane, steady-state 
gas ﬂux, and membrane thickness, respectively [ 55 , 56 ]. Permeabil- 
ity is commonly expressed in Barrer unit, where 1 Barrer = 10 −10 
cm 3  (STP).cm/(cm 2 .s.cmHg)  [ 57 , 58 ].  Any  increase  in  the  gas  ﬂux 
(cm 3 (STP)/(cm 2 .s)) lowers the operating and capital costs of mem- 
brane processes. This is achievable by increasing a membrane per- 
meability or decreasing a membrane thickness [59] . This has mo- 
tivated  the  development  of  defect-free  selective  thin  ﬁlm  com- 
posite (TFC) membranes with a thickness of 0.1–1 μm. Generally, 
highly-permeable  scalable  membranes  ( > 10 0 0  GPU),  GPU = 10 –6 
cm 3  (STP)/(cm 2 .s.cmHg)  with  sieving  ability  of  40  and  descent 
2 separation from a real 
plasticization resistance are needed for CO 
gas mixture containing various components [60–62] . Cellulose ac- 
etate, perﬂuoro polymers, and P84 polyimide (PI) have been used 
commercially  for  natural  gas  sweetening,  as  they  exhibit  good 
chemical,  mechanical,  and  thermal  stability,  as  well  as  excellent 
processability  [63] .  However,  their  major  weakness  is  that  their

permeability  and  selectivity  cannot  be  improved  simultaneously 
[ 64 ,–65 ].  Additionally,  the  separation  of  CO 
2  from  natural  gas  is 
2 S, 
very challenging, as natural gas usually includes water vapor, H 
heavy aliphatics, and aromatics, which cause membrane plasticiza- 
tion. 

Different  types  of  membranes  have  been  studied  and  intro- 
duced to attain high CO 
2 /gas selectivity. They 
2 permeability and CO 
include  mixed-matrix  membranes  (MMMs),  thermally-rearranged 
membranes  [66] ,  and  carbon  molecular  sieve  (CMS)  membranes 
[67] .  MMMs  typically  have  defects,  restricting  their  commercial- 
ization  [68–70] .  By  applying  high  temperatures  (350-450 °C  and 
> 500 °C),  thermally-rearranged  membranes  [66]  and  carbon  CMS 
membranes [67] have been fabricated, but their fragility, high cost, 
and complexity have impeded their industrial applications. To fab- 
ricate a polymer membrane with a high CO 
2 permeance, an amor- 
phous and solution-processable polymer with a high surface area 
is  required.  Freeman  [65]  theoretically  showed  that  suppressing 
the chain mobility and increasing the chain rigidity of a polymer 
improve the gas-separation performance of membranes made from 
the polymer. 

By creating high free-volume (increasing the intra-chain rigid- 
ity) and constructing ultra-microporosity (precisely controlling in- 
terconnected  pores),  highly  permeable  polymers  of  intrinsic  mi- 
croporosity (PIMs) have been fabricated [71] . The manipulation of 
intra-chain and inter-chain rigidities has resulted in the synthesis 
of microporous polymers with tailored free-volumes and transport 
properties. Budd et al. designed and fabricated the ﬁrst PIM mem- 
brane  (named  PIM-1)  [72] .  Their  work  was  a  major  advance  in 
membrane gas separation. PIM-1 has a quasi-ladder spirobisindane 
(SBI), known as spiro, which has two cyclopentane rings containing 
two methyl groups connected and linked with arene rings [ 73 , 74 ]. 
The high surface area of PIM-1 ( > 700 m 2 /g) allows for high gas 
uptakes and provides extremely high gas permeability [75–83] . The 
high permeability (up to 52800 Barrer) of PIM membranes is due 
to their high speciﬁc surface area (up to 1,050 m 2 /g) and high mi- 
croporosity [ 84 , 85 ]. This high level of gas permeability shows that, 
in  addition  to  the  solution-diffusion  mechanism,  the  convective- 

diffusion  mechanism  contributes  to  gas  transport  in  PIM  mem- 
branes [86] . At low pressures, the gas uptake of PIM membranes is 
through ultra-micropores. However, at high pressures, the gas up- 
take is through micropores [87] . So, the gas solubility coeﬃcients 
of PIM membranes are higher than those of low-free-volume com- 
mercial membranes. 

The effects of the gas-molecule size on the gas-transport prop- 
erties of PIM membranes can be explained by using the relation- 
ships  between  diffusion  and  sorption  coeﬃcients,  and  the  criti- 
cal  volume,  temperature,  effective  kinetic  diameter,  and  van  der 
Waals volume of gases [86] . In addition to the dual-mode sorp- 
tion model for CO 
2 uptake, Anderson and de Boer (GAB) layered- 
adsorption model can be used [86] . Sorption kinetics imply the oc- 
currence of the convective–diffusion mechanism with different na- 
tures, compared to the solution-diffusion mechanism. The excep- 
tional gas transport properties of PIM membranes have led to the 
2  separation from 
establishment of the new upper bounds for CO 
fuel and ﬂue gases, and a new upper bound for CO 
4 separa- 
tion under mixed-gas conditions ( Fig. 1 ) [ 88 , 89 ]. However, so far, a 
limited number of PIM membranes have surpassed the 2008 Robe- 
2 and CO 
son upper bounds for CO 
2 - 
This  review  paper  puts  recent  advances  in  PIMs  and  CO 
separation  PIM-based  membranes  into  perspective.  It  evaluates 
2  separation  performance  of  novel  PIMs  in  terms  of  up- 
the  CO 
dated/redeﬁned upper bounds for CO 
2  containing gas streams. It 
identiﬁes strategies that allow for modifying polymer structure and

2. Current challenges in PIM membranes for CO 2 separation 

The performance of PIM membranes can be improved to some 
extent  via  substituting  the  spiro  moiety  with  different  building 
blocks. Thus, the selection of a good moiety is certainly important 

3

regardless of the type of PIM materials. The performance of sev- 
eral PIM-based membranes has been found to be above the 2008 
Robeson upper bounds. However, the fabrication of highly perme- 
able and highly selective microporous membranes has always been 
challenging, and the industrial use of these membranes is still rare. 
Furthermore, physical aging and plasticization are still two main 
drawbacks of these membranes, which have primarily hindered the 
industrial  use  of  PIM-based  membranes  for  gas  separation  [91] . 
Physical aging is the phenomenon of membrane transport-property 
deterioration.  It  alters  the  free  volume  of  glassy  polymers.  It  is 
faster and occurs continuously over several years when the mem- 
brane has a high free volume. Physical aging can be mitigated with 
an appropriate design of the polymer backbone architecture, post- 
modiﬁcations, and the use of hybrid materials [92] . Plasticization 
is the drop in the selectivity of the desired gas due to the rear- 
rangement of the polymer molecular structure caused by the high 
uptake of CO 
2 and/or condensable gases. A balance between inter- 
and intra-chain rigidities mitigates the plasticization. In the case 
of PIM MMMs, there is an additional challenge; that is, the need 
for good compatibility of the polymer and the ﬁller, the absence 
of which leads to the aggregation of the nanoparticles and their 
poor dispersion in the polymer matrix. This review covers strate- 
gies to mitigate physical aging, plasticization, and poor polymer- 
ﬁller compatibility. 

3. PIM membranes containing different contortion sites 

Many effort s have been made to improve the performance of 
PIM membranes by incorporating desired moieties into the back- 
bone  of  the  polymers  [93] .  PIM-based  membranes  are  classiﬁed 
according to their type of sterically hindered building block. By in- 
troducing PIMs with rigid bulky contortion sites into PI backbones, 
PIM-PIs are prepared. Fig. 2 shows the structure of PIM-based poly- 
mers containing different rigid moieties. This section covers PIMs 
consisting of different building blocks with distinct rigidity and ro- 
tational freedom. The 2008 Robeson and the redeﬁned 2019 upper 
bounds are used as benchmarks to evaluate the performance of the 
PIM membranes for CO 

2 separation. 

3.1. Spirobisindane (SBI)-based PIM membranes 

The discovery of PIM-1 [55] showed a new path to fabricating 
high-performance membranes. PIM-1 is the product of the conden- 
sation  reaction  of  5,5 (cid:3) ,6,6 (cid:3) -tetrahydroxy-3,3,3 (cid:3) ,3 (cid:3) -tetramethyl-1,1 (cid:3) - 
spirobisindane  (TTSBI)  and  tetraﬂuoroterephthalonitrile  (TFTPN), 
introducing the SBI moiety to the backbone of the polymer. PIM- 
1 has an extraordinary surface area and considerably higher per- 
meability than low free-volume commercial PIs and cellulose ac- 
2 separation performance of PIM-1 has been reported 
etate. The CO

to  be  both  below  and  above  the  2008  Robeson  upper  bounds. 
These discrepancies arise from different sam ple history, prepara- 
tion conditions, etc. For example, gas separation performance of a 
PIM membrane strongly depends on its thickness, casting solvent, 
thermal history, non-solvent (methanol, ethanol) treatment, and so 
on. Crosslinked PIM-SBI nanoﬁlms can be formed by the interfacial 
polymerization [95] . 

3.1.1. Interlocked SBI-based PIM membranes 

2 Cl 

The  interlocked  SBI-based  monomer  is  synthesized  via  poly- 
condensation, leading to the formation of interlocked PIM-1 called 
PIM-C1. PIM-C1 has an interlocked polycyclic structure generated 
by an eight-membered dihydrooxocine ring locking into the spiro- 
carbon hinge point. High molecular weight PIM-C1 has good sol- 
ubility in several solvents (CHCl 
2 , and chlorobenzene) and 
3 , CH 
has a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of 818 m 2  g −1 . 
The smaller dihedral angle between the two benzene rings of PIM- 
C1 compared to that of PIM-1 conﬁrms the more twisted nature 
of the moiety of the interlocked polymer. The higher rigidity pa- 
rameter value of the interlocked SBI (20 kcal mol −1  rad −2 ) com- 
pared to that of SBI (8.6 kcal mol −1 rad −2 ) conﬁrms that PIM-C1 is 
more inﬂexible than PIM-1 [96] . Compared to PIM-1, the suppres- 
sion of vibrational planes around the SBI center results in a higher 
inter-chain distance and a higher free-volume. The PIM-C1 mem- 
2 permeability of 18,900 Barrer, a mod- 
brane has shown a high CO 
erate CO 
4 selectivity 
of 14.4, which place the performances of this membrane close to 
the revisited 2019 CO 

2 selectivity of 19.3, and a modest CO 

4 upper bounds [96] .

3.1.2. Phenazine SBI (PSBI)-based PIM membranes 

Phenazine SBI (PSBI)-AB is a solution-processable, high molecu- 
lar weight, and thermally-stable microporous polymer, which can 
be  synthesized  via  self-polymerization  of  an  AB  monomer  (AB: 
monomer containing two types of reactive groups) [97] . SBI tetraol 
reacts in four reaction steps and forms a monomer containing cat- 
echol  and  aromatic  dichloride  groups.  PSBI-AB  bears  both  diox- 
ane  and  phenazine  rings.  Compared  to  PIM-1,  PSBI-AB  has  one 
dioxane ring, one phenazine ring, but no nitrile groups. Although 
the  dioxane  ring  of  PIM-1  can  be  replaced  with  the  more  rigid 
phenazine  ring,  the  absence  of  two  nitrile  side  groups  induces 
2  perme- 
more chain intermolecular packing for PSBI-AB. The CO 
ability and CO 
4 selectivity of PSBI-AB are lower than those of 
PIM-1, which can be attributed to the lack of side groups of the 
benzene ring connected to the phenazine. This shows the impor- 
tance of side groups of PIM membranes for providing more free 
volume even with less rigid backbones.

3.1.3. SBI-based PIM membranes with different side chains 

SBI-based  homopolymers  and  copolymers  can  be  synthe- 
sized  using  tetraﬂuoroterephthalo  monomers.  The  less  tetraﬂu- 
oroterephthalonitrile  is  used,  the  lower  is  the  free  volume  of 
the  resulting  polymers  and  copolymers.  The  synthesis  of  a  ho- 
mopolymer (TFMPSPIM1) and a series of microporous copolymers 
(TFMPSPIM2-4)  from  tetraﬂuoro  monomers  such  as  heptaﬂuoro- 
p-tolylphenylsulfone (HFTPS) and TFTPN monomers have been re- 
ported ( Fig. 3 ) [98] . As the level of HFTPS in the copolymers in- 
creases,  the  mechanical  and  thermal  stability  of  the  copolymers 
increase, but their molecular weights decrease. The homopolymers 
and copolymers have extraordinarily high fractional free volumes 
2  permeability de- 
(FFVs). As the HFTPS content increases, the CO 
creases, but the sieving ability increases. The CO 
2 permeability and 
the CO 
2 selectivity are in the range of 731–3616 Barrer and 17–
22, respectively. As the HFTPS content increases, the d-spacing re- 
lated to the chain distances, the inter-chain distance and the intra- 
chain  rigidity  decrease.  This  type  of  tight  chain  packing  reduces 

2 /N 

Various  homopolymers  and  copolymers  called  DSPIM  can  be 
prepared  using  TTSBI,  TFTPN,  HFTPS,  disulfonyl  monomers,  and 
tetraﬂuorotetraoxide thianthrene (TFTOT) monomers ( Fig. 3 ) [99] . 
The copolymers containing TFTPN/disulfone-based monomers (3:1) 
exhibit  good  ﬁlm-forming  property,  great  thermal  stability,  and 
high molecular weight. Electronic and steric effects of disulfonyl- 
based  cause  little  crosslinking  in  the  homopolymers.  The  pen- 
dant disulfone groups increase the CO 
2 selectivity but decrease 
the CO 
2 permeability. Disulfone-based monomers decrease the free 
volume  via  space-ﬁlling,  especially  when  a  benzene  ring  linked 
to the disulfone group exists. Increasing the size of the disulfonyl 
groups leads to ﬁlling the inter-chain space and lowering FFV. So, 
the gas permeability can be tuned by adjusting the monomer con- 
tents and the size of disulfonyl groups. The use of the disulfone 
monomers containing ethyl groups results in higher selectivity and 
permeability of the copolymers. 

2 /N 

Tetraﬂuorotetraoxide thianthrene (TFTOT) has been used to de- 
velop  a  homopolymer  (TOTPIM)  and  several  copolymers  ( Fig.  3 ) 
[100] .  TOTPIM  and  the  copolymers  of  TTSBI,  TFTOT,  and  TFTPN 
exhibit high microporosity and high conformational ﬂexibility. In- 
creasing TFTOT content improves the eﬃcient chain packing and 
2 permeabilities of the copolymers to be- 
consequently lowers CO 
2 selectivity signif- 
low that of PIM-1 but cannot affect the CO 
2 /N 
icantly.  The  homopolymer  has  the  lowest  CO 
2  permeability,  but 
its  CO 
2  selectivity  is  above  those  of  PIM-1  and  the  copoly- 
mers. Therefore, integrating TFTOT into a copolymer structure low- 
2  permeability without any considerable improvement 
ers the CO 
in  the  CO 
2  selectivity.  Almost  the  same  behavior  is  observed 
2 /N 
for copolymers containing TTSBI, TFTPN, and THDN [100] .

3.2. Spirobiﬂuorene (SBF)-based PIM membranes 

The  presence  of  spirobiﬂuorene  (SBF)  moiety  [101]  can  in- 
crease the CO 
2 separation performance of PIM membranes signif- 
icantly.  Replacing  the  SBI  moiety  in  PIM-1  with  the  more  rigid 
SBF,  which  has  a  lower  dihedral-angle  variation,  restricts  chain

movements  due  to  the  additional  fused  arene  rings  of  Poly  [1- 
(trimethylsilyl)-1-propyne] SBF [101] . The SBF moiety can be gen- 
erated via adding 2-lithio anion of 3, 4-dimethoxybiphenyl to 2, 3- 
dimethoxyﬂuorenone followed by acid-mediated cyclization [102] . 
The BET surface area of the PIM-SBF is 803 m 2 .g −1  [75–79] . The 
gas permeability and selectivity of PIM-SBF are higher than PIM-1. 
The CO 
4 solubility selectivity of PIM-SBF is similar to that of 
PIM-1, while its diffusivity selectivity is higher. On the other hand, 
its CO 
2 solubility selectivity is higher than PIM-1, but its diffu- 
sivity selectivity is similar to PIM-1.

Different substituents such as methyl, t-butyl, and fused benzo 
groups can be placed onto the SBF moiety leading to the derivation 
of various PIM-SBF membranes [103] . The PIM derived from the 
tetramethyl substituted SBF shows a CO 
2  permeability of 22,300 
Barrer, which is the highest value reported to date for PIM mem- 
branes bearing SBF moiety, placing the performance of this mem- 
brane close to the redeﬁned 2019 CO 

2 Robeson upper bound.

2 uptake, a high FFV of 0.276, and 3D 
contorted chains, endowing this membrane with a CO 
2 permeabil- 
ity of 17,500 Barrer and a CO

3.6. 2, 2 (cid:3) , 3, 3 (cid:3) -tetrahydroxy-1, 1 (cid:3) -dinaphthyl (THDN)-based PIM 
membranes 

Combining the bulky and non-planar 2, 2 (cid:3) , 3, 3 (cid:3) -tetrahydroxy- 
1, 1 (cid:3) -dinaphthyl (THDN) moiety with SBI leads to the synthesis of 
high-molecular-weight  copolymers  with  a  low  polydispersity  in- 
dex  (PDI)  [108] .  The  spatially  distorted  THDN  bond  between  its 
two  rings  and  the  twisted  SBI  core  block  disrupt  chain  packing, 
leading  to  improved  intrinsic  microporosity.  The  moieties  incor- 
porated into the copolymer backbone provide high FFV and ren- 
der high CO 
2 permeability because of ineﬃcient chain packing. Ex- 
cellent solution processability, thermal stability, and ﬁlm-forming 
properties can be acquired for DNPIM-25 (THDN/TTSBI molar ratio 
of 1/3), and DNPIM-33 (THDN/TTSBI molar ratio of 1/2), copoly- 
mers containing THDN and TTSBI [108] , where DN denotes to di- 
naphthyl groups. Under similar operating conditions, the DNPIM- 
2 permeability, compared 
33 has a higher selectivity, but a lower CO 
to the PIM-1. DNPIM-25 is more selective than PIM-1, while its CO 
2 
permeability is slightly lower [100] . DNPIM-50 (THDN/TTSBI molar 
ratio of 1/1) showed a CO 
2  permeability of about 70% less than 
PIM-1.

3.7.1. Benzotriptycene-based PIM membranes 

High molecular weight PIM-hexaphenylbenzene (HPB) polymers 
containing methyl (PIM-CH 
3 -HPB), bromine (PIM-Br-HPB), and ni- 
trile  (PIM-CN-HPB)  substituents  have  BET  surface  areas  in  the 
range  of  410  – 560  m 2  g −1 .  PIM-Br-HPB  and  PIM-CN-HPB  have 
lower  surface  areas  than  PIM-CH 
3 -HPB,  due  to  their  more  eﬃ- 
cient chain packing originated from their stronger dipolar interac-

Gas diffusivity and permeability in these membranes are tuned by 
changing  the  polarity  of  the  substituents  in  the  polymer  chains 
[ 104 , 105 ]. 

3.4. Tetraphenylethylene (TPE)-based PIM membranes 

Tetraphenylethylene  (TPE)-PIM  and  TPE-SBI-PIM  membranes 
have high solution processability, excellent thermal resistance, and 
high surface area (550 to 6 60 m 2  g −1 ) [10 6] . The wider dihedral 
angle  of  the  TPE  compared  to  that  of  the  SBI  moiety  results  in 
larger conformational freedom and lower free volume of the TPE- 
2  se- 
PIM than PIM-1. A CO 
lectivity of 26, and a CO 
4 selectivity of 20.9 were obtained for 
TPE-PIM. As the SBI moiety content increases, the gas permeability 
increases but the selectivity declines [106] .

The benzotriptycene (BTrip)-based PIM membranes have excel- 
lent gas separation performance [88] , as such they have provided 
researchers  with  new  opportunities  for  the  preparation  and  de- 
sign of novel PIMs. Membranes made from new members of the 
BTrip  PIM  family  can  exhibit  so  high  gas  separation  properties, 
necessitating the introduction of new CO 
2 upper 
bounds. These new membranes contain sterically crowded, solubi- 
lizing groups like hexamethylindane and triﬂuoromethyl [88] . Re- 
cently, the Robeson upper bounds for CO 
4 mem- 
brane gas separations have been updated and redeﬁned using a se- 
ries of ultrapermeable BTrip-based PIM membranes. This improve- 
ment  will  ensure  the  superiority  of  ultrapermeable  PIM  mem- 
branes (up to 52,800 Barrer) for CO 
2 separation applications com- 
pared with existing competing technologies ( Table 1 and Fig. 4 A, 
4 separation performances of BTrip PIM membranes 
B). The CO 
2  sepa- 
are  well  above  the  2008  Robeson  bound,  and  the  CO 
ration  performances  of  benzotriptycene  PIM  membranes  also  lie 
above  the  2008  Robeson  bound.  Interestingly,  PIM-BTrip  is  the 
most attractive among them. Membranes in this family (whether 
CO2 > 4,0 0 0 Barrer 
thin or thick, new or aged, etc.) have shown P 
2 selectivity higher than 30. The remarkable separation 
and CO 
performance of PIM-BTrip membrane seems to be originated from 
its high CO 
2 diffusivity selectivity. However, the high separation 
performance of the other members of this family containing sub- 
stituted groups are due to their high CO 
2 solubility selectivities 
[88] .

3.5. Tröger’s base (TB)-based PIM membranes 

Tröger’s  base  (TB)-PIM  and  TB-SBI-PIM  [107]  are  two  other 
classes  of  PIM  membranes.  TB-PIM100  is  not  soluble  in  com- 
mon solvents. However, when the TB content of a TB-SBI-PIM is 
more than 40 wt%, the TB-SBI-PIM is partially soluble in organic 
solvents.  TB-PIM25  (tetrahydroxyl-TB  (THTB)/TTSBI,  1/3)  and  TB- 
PIM33 (THTB/TTSBI, 1/2) have high BET surface areas of 760 and 
698 m 2 g −1 , respectively, and good solution processability. As the 
2 permeability decreases, 
level of TB in the copolymer increases, CO 
while the gas selectivity increases. A high level of TB in the copoly- 
mer results in a narrow pore size distribution and a low accessible 
free volume for gas transport. Compared to PIM-1, a 33 % loss in 
2 selectivity were ob- 
CO 
tained for TB-PIM33 membrane [107] .

Attaching the tetramethyltetrahydronaphthalene (TMN) moiety 
to a blade of the Trip moiety results in PIM-TMN-Trip, which is a 
solution-processable polymer. Fusing TMN as a bulky substituent, 
makes the polymer soluble in common solvents. Regarding PIM- 
TMN- Trip, a high BET surface area of 1,050 m 2 g −1 is obtained due 
to ineﬃcient chain packing [109] . The coexistence of large micro- 
pores (7-10  ˚A) and interconnected small ultra-micropores ( < 7 ˚A) 
in the structure of PIM-TMN-Trip together provide an exceptional 
CO 
2 permeability of 33,0 0 0 Barrer and a moderate selectivity. The 
dibenzodioxin  group  connects  each  Trip  moiety  co-planar  to  its 
neighbor via 2D ribbon-like chains. The high FFV of PIM-TMN-Trip 
(0.314) is almost the same with poly [1-(trimethylsilyl)-1-propyne] 
(PTMSP) (0.32) [ 109 , 110 ]. In addition to ultra-permeability, higher 
selectivity, improved membrane robustness, lower aging rate, and 
enhanced thermal stability of PIM-TMN-Trip, compared to PTMSP,

ing 9,10-iso and linear propyl-substituted triptycene moieties are 
called TPIM-1 and TPIM-2, respectively ( Fig. 5 a, b). Planar and con- 
torted ribbon-like chain conﬁgurations are observed in molecular 
simulation of TPIMs [71] . The fused-ring and highly-rigid Trip moi- 
ety, the restricted rotation of the phenazine moiety, and the con- 
formational barrier of their backbone provide TPIM-1 and TPIM-2 
with intra-chain rigidity higher than PIM-1 and PIM-PIs. The sur- 
face areas of TPIM-1 and TPIM-2 are 862 and 612 m 2 g −1 , respec- 
2 adsorption of TPIM-1 than TPIM-2 ( Fig. 5 c), 
tively. The higher N 
especially  in  low  pressures,  conﬁrms  the  narrow  pore  size  dis- 
tribution  ( Fig.  5 d)  and  high  ultra-microporosity  of  TPIM-1.  The 
high surface area and ultra-microporosity of TPIM-1 are attributed 
to  the  chain  packing  disruption  caused  by  the  Trip  core  block 
and  the  large  sizes  of  the  bridgehead  substituents.  The  molec- 
ular  sieving  ability  of  TPIMs  is  ascribed  to  chain  rigidity  and 
ultra-microporosity. The CO 
2  permeabilities of TPIM-1 and TPIM- 
2 are 1545 and 434 Barrer, respectively. The higher permeability 
of  TPIM-1  is  due  to  its  higher  solubility  coeﬃcient  provided  by 
its larger surface area and greater diffusivity coeﬃcient. The lower 
permeability of TPIM-2 compared to TPIM-1 is due to accessible 
free-volume of TPIM-2 being ﬁlled partially with more ﬂexible lin- 
ear propyl groups of TPIM-2. Furthermore, TPIM-1 is more selective 
than TPIM-2, because a larger portion of its pore size distribution 
is inside the ultra-microporosity region. 

The simultaneous improvement of the CO 
2 /CH 

2 permeability and the 
CO 
4  selectivity  of  TPIM-1  indicates  the  effectiveness  of  the 
short, branched isopropyl substituent of TPIM-1. The presence of 
the isopropyl substituent improves the surface area of the polymer. 
It increases the membrane ultra-microporosity and disrupts chain 
packing  of  TPIM-1.  In  CO 
4  separation,  high  selectivity  and 
permeability can be achieved simultaneously through substituting 
ﬂexible  groups  with  stiffer  ones  such  as  phenazine  and  through 
connecting branched, short and bulky groups to the bridgehead of 
rigid moieties.

take.  More  physical  aging  resistance  of  CF 
PIM-1  despite  higher  intrinsic  microporosity  ( Fig.  6 d)  represents 
a promising new platform of materials for CO 
2 separation. Excep-

tional  CO

bar)  can  be  attained  for  both  OMe-ROMP  and  CF 
branes which is the highest to date for PIM membranes ( Fig. 6 c).

3.8. PIM membranes containing two contortion sites 

3.8.1. Tröger’s base PIM membranes containing PIM-X-TB 

The inclusion of methano-1, 5-diazocine (TB moiety) into PIMs 
improves microporosity and gas transport properties. The reason 
is high rigidity of this building block, which prevents the forma- 
tion of the coplanar pattern [113] . Also, the incorporation of the 
2 - 
TB  contortion  site  in  the  polymer  backbone  increases  its  CO 
philic  property  [96] .  High  CO 
2  permeability  (7,696  Barrer)  and 
2  selectivity  ( < 13.3)  can  be  achieved  by  incor- 
moderate  CO 
2 /N 
porating  ethanoanthracene (EA)  and  TB  contortion  sites  simulta- 
neously in the polymer backbone. PIM-EA-TB has a high surface 
area  (1,028  m 2 /g)  and  a  rigid  backbone  [114] .  The  higher  rigid- 
ity  of  the  EA  and  TB  than  SBI  and  dioxane  moieties  allows  for 
the  preparation  of  highly  intrinsic  microporous  fused-ring  poly- 
mers  [115] .  The  high  CO 
2  permeability  can  be  obtained  thanks 
to  the  combined  effects  of  high  diffusivity  and  high  solubility 
coeﬃcients. 

To create more free volume and intrinsic microporosity within 
the polymers, Trip can be an appropriate alternative moiety. The 
substitution  of  EA  by  Trip,  containing  no  methyl  substituents  at 
its bridgehead, which has more rigidity, provided the PIM-Trip-TB 
2  permeability (9,709 vs. 7,696 Bar- 
membrane with improved CO 
rer  for  PIM-EA-TB),  CO 
2  selectivity  (15.9  vs.  13.3  for  PIM-EA- 
TB), and CO 
4 selectivity (10.7 vs. 9.9 for PIM-EA-TB) [114] . The 
use  of  Trip  building  block  preserves  inter-chain  distances,  with- 
out a need for methyl substituents. The apparent BET surface area 
of PIM-Trip-TB is 899 m 2 /g. The attachment of additional benzene 

2 /CH 

2 /N 

ring to the Trip further increases the internal free volume of Trip 
with the formation of BTrip moiety [ 116 –119 ]. PIM-BTrip-TB has a 
high BET surface area (870 m 2 /g) and good processability, which 
forms  robust  membranes.  The  high  rigidity,  bulky  structure,  and 
high internal free volume of the BTrip moiety in PIM-BTrip-TB lead 
to a high CO 
2  permeability of 13,200 Barrer [118] . A robust free- 
standing  PIM-MP-TB  membrane  containing  a  rigid  methanopen- 
tacene  (MP)  core  block  unit  can  be  fabricated  by  dissolving  the 
polymer  in  chloroform  [120] .  Compared  to  other  PIM-TB  mem- 
branes, PIM-MP-TB with a BET surface area of 743 m 2 /g has lower 
CO 
2 permeability. Fig. 7 shows molecular structures of several PIM- 
X-TB polymers. 

3.8.2. PIMs with different combinations of ethanoanthracene, 
spirobisindane, and cardo-based contortion sites 

Reactive  tetrachloride  monomers  containing  phenazine,  SBI, 
and  EA  moieties  can  react  with  tetrahydroxy  SBI,  SBF,  and  EA 
monomers, leading to the synthesis of PIM-7 to PIM-10, and Cardo- 
PIM-1 and Cardo-PIM-2 [121] ( Fig. 8 ). PIM-7 and Cardo-PIM-1 have 
the ﬁlm-forming ability, high BET surface area ( > 620 m 2 g −1 ), and 
high pore volume ( > 0.51 cm 3 g −1 ). The high CO 
2 permeability of 
PIM-7 (1,100 Barrer) points to the creation of a stiff backbone in 
PIM-7. The presence of Cardo units in Cardo-PIM-1 backbone re- 
sults in more conformational freedom and ﬂexibility. This leads to 
2  permeability (430 Barrer) and satisfactory selectivity for 
low CO 
2 /N 
2 (33).

PIs  with  intrinsic  microporosity  allow  for  fabricating  highly- 
permeable  and  adequately-selective  membranes  with  high  me- 
chanical  and  thermal  stability  [74] .  Dianhydrides  and  diamines 
containing a rigid moiety introduce motion-restricted segments to 
PIM-PIs structures. Diamine and dianhydride structures allow for 

10 

Various  diamines  with  different  rigid  moieties  are  synthe- 
sized  [ 114 , 116 , 118 , 127–131 ].  Fig.  10  shows  the  structures  of  the 
mostly used diamines. It is believed that introducing a bulky moi- 
ety  into  the  polymer  backbone  improves  membrane  permeabil- 
ity.  To  achieve  this,  two  PIs  containing  iptycene  diamine  [Trip- 
based  diamine  (DAT1)  or  BTrip-based  diamine  (DAT2)]  and  2, 
2-bis-(3,4-dicarboxyphenyl) hexaﬂuoropropane dianhydride(6FDA), 
called  6FDA-DAT1  and  6FDA-DAT2,  can  be  prepared  [ 116 , 132 ]. 
Compared to 6FDA-DAT1, 6FDA–DAT2 has a higher free volume, a 
higher surface area, but less chain packing due to the additional 
aromatic ring stacked on the Trip moiety. 6FDA–DAT2 has a higher 
2  permeability than that of 6FDA–DAT1 (210 Barrer for 6FDA–
CO 
4  se- 
DAT2  and  120  Barrer  for  6FDA–DAT1),  but  a  lower  CO 
lectivity (30 vs. 38). The two PIs also have moderate CO 
2  se- 
4 selectivities). Since they have 
lectivities (lower than their CO

6FDA–DAT2 is attributed to its higher diffusion coeﬃcient. 6FDA-

The free volume of PIs containing iptycene moieties can be tai- 
lored by several methods. Using 1, 4-triptycene diamines with dif- 
ferent substituent groups adjacent to the Trip moiety, several Trip- 

based PIs can be designed and synthesized [ 133 , 134 ]. The synthe- 
sized polymers show high solubility in solvents, high processabil- 
ity, and tailored free volume. The introduction of Trip block near 
substituent  groups  in  PIs  results  in  moderate  FFV  ranging  from 
0.151 to 0.183. This free volume range allows for gas permeabili- 
ties even higher than those of commercial membranes with simi- 
lar free volumes, revealing the importance of Trip open ﬁssures. In 

Fig. 11.  Molecular structures of PIM-PIs containing contortion sites in diamines [ 89 , 92 , 100 ].Microporous PI membranes can be designed and synthesized using SBF-based 
diamines (SBF), brominated SBF (BSBF), and three different dianhydrides [6FDA, pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA), and spiro-based dianhydride (SPDA)] [139] . The brominated 
polymers exhibit large surface areas. Bromination has no considerable effect on the thermal stability. However, the char yield of the brominated PIs is 10% less than that of 
the pristine PI. The dianhydride type has a signiﬁcant effect on the gas permeabilities and the order of the permeabilities. 6FDA-SBF has CO 2 permeability of 182 Barrer and 
the permeability order is CO 2 > N 2 > CH 4 . However, SPDA-SBF shows CO 2 permeability of 614 Barrer and the permeability order is CO 2 > CH 4 > N 2 . Bromination increases 
the chain stiffness of the polymer due to the impeded single bond rotation of bromine [96] . The incorporation of the bromine groups into the SBF diamine increases the CO 2 
permeability due to the gas diffusivity and solubility enhancements without sacriﬁcing the selectivity, especially for CO 2 /CH 4 separation.

addition to micro-cavities created by ineﬃcient chain packing, the 
presence of the opened clefts leads to a bimodal pore size distri- 
bution in these polymers. 

Three  PIs  with  different  backbone  geometries  containing  1,4- 
trip-para  (symmetric)  and  2,6-trip-ortho  (asymmetric)  diamines 
were  investigated  [135] .  The  more  contorted  backbone  of  the 
6FDA-2,6-trip-ortho results in more chain packing disruption and 
higher accessible volume. It was found that 6FDA-1,4-trip-para has 
the lowest d-spacing, the highest glass transition temperature (T g ), 
and the smallest cavities. The change in the alignment of the PI 
backbone from para to ortho led to a 29% reduction in the CO 
2 
permeability. Also, physical aging did not affect the gas transport 
properties of the PIs signiﬁcantly. Trip-based diamines containing 
amine groups that are connected directly to the Trip moiety can 
be used to produce copolymers with different backbone rigidities 
[136] . 

To increase the moiety participation and decrease the ethereal 
oxygen density, the type of triptycene diamines (with or without 
ethereal oxygen) can be adjusted. Diamines without ethereal oxy- 
gen increase the inter- and intra-chain rigidities and the free vol- 
ume. The permeability improvement without sacriﬁcing the sieving 
ability is attained by increasing the triptycene level and decreasing 
the ethereal oxygen content due to the formation of more ultra- 
microporosity. The substitution of Trip with pentiptycene in 1, 4- 
triptycene diamines, possessing different substituent groups, does 
not alter the trend. In addition, 6FDA-(pentiptycene diamine) PPDA 
PIs exhibit bimodal pore size distributions [127] . The replacement 
of the Trip moiety with the pentiptycene one in the polymer back- 
bone results in higher free volume and larger inter-chain distances 
[137] . The CO 
2  permeabilities of 6FDA-PPDA PIs are in the range 
of 55-132 Barrer. Although pentiptycene moiety causes ineﬃcient 
chain packing, the ethereal oxygen in the backbone of polymers 
might have an opposing effect on it [127] . Therefore, the low per- 
meability (compared to that of microporous PIMs) and the ﬂexibil- 
ity of the resulting polymer are attributed to the ethereal oxygen 
[127] . 

Mechanically  robust  membranes  can  be  synthesized  using 
copolymers consisting of 6FDA, PPDA, and linear polyethylene ox- 
ide (PEO)-based diamines [138] . The incorporation of the PEO leads 

to a decrease in the CO 
2  permeability due to the lower free vol- 
ume of these copolymers, compared to 6FDA-PPDA. These conﬁrm 
the potential of Trip and pentiptycene moieties for tuning free vol- 
ume and increasing the aging resistance of PIs. However, the CO 
2 
permeabilities of these membranes are lower than those of other 
PIM-PIs due to the existence of etheric oxygens in their backbones, 
which  lower  their  free  volumes.  Fig.  11  represents  structures  of 
PIM-PIs containing contortion sites in diamines. 

Taking the advantage of the type, the position and the number 
of substituents of TB-based diamines, researchers have attempted 
to  tune  gas  transport  properties  of  PIs  with  various  structures 
[ 122 , 128 , 140 ]. To synthesize TB-based PIs, two TB-based diamines 
containing  two  methyl  groups  in  two  different  positions  [2,8 
diamino-4,10-dimethyl,11-methanodibenzo-diazocine  (TBDA1)  and 
3,9-diamino-4,10-dimethyl,11-methanodibenzo-diazocine  (TBDA2)] 
can be designed and synthesized. Four TB-based PIs can be pre- 
pared from these diamines, 6FDA, and 4,4-oxidiphthalic anhydride 
(ODPA).  In  addition  to  good  ﬁlm-forming,  6FDA-TBDA1-PI  has  a 
CO 
2  permeability of 285 Barrer with satisfactory selectivity. Free 
volume  and  d-spacing  results  agree  with  permeability  data.  The 
kinked structure of TB, the closeness of the methyl group to the 
amine unit, and the presence of bulky groups in the 6FDA struc- 
ture  cause  high  solubility  and  diffusivity  coeﬃcients,  as  well  as 
2 permeability without sacriﬁcing the selectivity. 
high CO 

Good  processability,  extraordinary  thermal  stability,  high  Tg, 
and  good  mechanical  properties  can  be  achieved  by  incorporat- 
ing  the  TB  moiety  into  the  polymer  structure  using  polymeriza- 
tion of imide containing diamines obtained from commercial di- 
anhydrides  [ 107 , 141–143 ].  The  introduction  of  TB  building  block 
into  the  polymer  backbone  creates  signiﬁcant  microporosity  and 
high  FFV.  The  TB  moiety  endows  the  membrane  with  the  anti- 
plasticization property. Two intrinsically microporous 6FDA-based 
PIs containing two TB-based di-o-substituted diamine monomers 
(PIM-PI-TB-1  and  PIM-PI-TB-2)  are  synthesized  possessing  high 
molecular weight, outstanding thermal stability, and excellent so- 
lution processability. In addition to four methyl groups in differ- 
ent positions, PIM-PI-TB-1 has two bromine atoms in its repeating 
unit. PIM-PI-TB-1 and PIM-PI-TB-2 have good solution processabil- 
ity, which is ascribed to the presence of the TB moiety, the bulky

3 groups, and the o-substituents that limit rotation around the 
imide bonds. Fast nitrogen adsorption at very low pressures reveals 
the ultra-microporous structure of the polymers created by the TB 
moiety, and the pendant o-methyl and o-bromine groups. BET sur- 
face area for PIM-PI-TB-1 and PIM-PI-TB-2 is 440 and 580 m 2 /g, 
respectively. Satisfactory permeability with low-to-moderate siev- 
ing ability is attained for these two membranes [140] . 

Considering the large microporosity that TB moiety creates, a 
TB diamine with four methyl groups (4MTBDA) is synthesized and 
used to prepare four TB-based PIs [122] . Restricted rotation around 
the imide bond provides intrinsic microporosity and BET surface 
areas  between  584  and  739  m 2 /g.  In  addition  to  their  microp- 
orous  structure,  the  four  PIs  possess  ﬁlm-forming  abilities  and 
high molecular weights. High permeabilities and low selectivities 
are  obtained  for  these  PIs.  Their  permeability  order  agrees  with 
their dianhydride rigidity order: PMDA  > SBF-based dianhydride 
(SBFDA) > SPDA > 6FDA. PMDA is a promising monomer, as its 
polymerization  produces  chains  with  a  rigid  backbone  and  high 
microporosity.  In  addition,  the  fabricated  membranes  have  high 
CO 
2 permeability and excellent selectivity. Table 3 and Fig. 12 show

4.2. PIM-PI membranes containing dianhydride contortion sites 

So far, only SBI-, SBF-, EA-, Trip- and pentiptycene-based dian- 
hydrides have been synthesized and embedded into PIM-PIs struc- 
tures [148–152] . Fig. 13 shows the structures of all existing dian- 
hydrides containing contorted moieties. Different PIM-PIs (PIM-PI- 
1 to PIM-PI-8) based on the SBI dianhydride with dioxane rings 
can be prepared using various diamines [149] . The PIs have BET 
surface areas of 471–683 m 2 /g, high thermal stability, CO 
2 perme- 
abilities of 210–3700 Barrer, CO 
2 selectivities of 22.6–26.8, and 
4 selectivities of 13.4–23.3. Among them, PIM-PI containing 
CO 
3, 3’-dimethylnaphthidine (DMN) has the highest CO 
2  permeabil- 
ity (3,700 Barrer) and a moderate CO 
2 selectivity (23.1) [149] . 
Modest performances of these membranes motivate the synthesis 
of SBI-based dianhydrides without dioxane rings. Among these PIs, 
PIM-PI-10 that contains DMN has a CO 
2 permeability of 2,154 Bar- 
rer and a CO 

2 selectivity of 25.6 [126] .

Membranes prepared from a SBI-based dianhydride and a SBI- 
based diamine (PIM-PI-11) have CO 
2  permeability and selectivity 
lower than those of PIM-PI-10. Eliminating the dibenzodioxin units 
in the polymer backbone and connecting the anhydride groups to 
the SBI moiety increase the polymer rigidity and CO 
2  permeabil- 
ity. However, PIM-PI-10 (based on SBI anhydride without dioxane 
rings) has lower CO 
2 permeability, compared to PIM-PI-8 (based on 
SBI anhydride with dioxane rings). 

The substitution of the SBI moiety for SBF in the dianhydride 
structure leads to the synthesis of the SBFDA. Highly microporous 
SBFDA-DMN (BET surface area of 686 m 2 /g) PI can be prepared via 
the imidization reaction of SBFDA and DMN. SBFDA-DMN has high 
microporosity, good processability, and exceptional thermal stabil- 
ity.  The  presence  of  a  great  number  of  ultra-micropores  ( < 7  ˚A) 
and pores larger than 1 nm provide the membrane with a high 
2 selectivity of 
CO 
18, and a low CO 
4 selectivity of 11.5 [153] . Fig. 14 represents 
structures of PIM-PIs containing contortion sites in dianhydride.

Rigid dibenzodioxane containing EA dianhydride (EAD-DA) has 
been  used  for  the  preparation  of  a  microporous  PI  having  DMN 
(EAD-DMN)  [155] .  EAD-DMN  has  a  BET  surface  area  of  800  m 2 
g −1 . As anticipated, adding the dibenzodioxane units to the poly- 
mer backbone decreases the polymer rigidity and, consequently, its 
CO 

2 permeability. 
Excellent performances of PI membranes containing EA-based 
dianhydrides have motivated researchers to synthesize other kinds

of dianhydrides containing rigid contortion sites. Amorphous and 
solution-processable  Trip-based  PIM-PIs  (KAUST-PI-series)  having 
high free volume and good sieving ability have been synthesized 
( Fig. 15 ) [ 125 , 151 ]. To tune the pore size distribution, the macro- 
molecular  rigidity,  and  inter-chain  distances,  Trip-based  dianhy- 
drides  with  9,  10-bridgehead-substituents  (diisopropyl,  dipropyl, 
and diethyl) are synthesized. In these dianhydrides, the less rigid 
SBI moiety in the SBI-based dianhydride containing dioxane rings 
is  replaced  with  the  more  rigid,  bulky,  torsion-resistant  bridged 
bicyclic  Trip  moiety.  The  degrees  of  torsional  freedom  in  differ- 
ent  contortion  sites  are  shown  in  Fig.  16 .  As  this  Figure  shows, 
the  torsional  freedom  of  the  bridged  bicyclic  moieties  such  as 
EA and Trip is less than those of the SBI and SBF moieties. Fur- 
thermore,  an  additional  vertical  aromatic  ring  makes  the  trip- 
tycene  moiety  the  most  torsion-resistant  among  the  building 
blocks shown in Fig. 16 . Seven diamines can be utilized to obtain 
various  PIs  with  different  properties.  More  selective  and  perme- 
able gas separation membranes can be designed and synthesized 
by the substitution of the SBI dianhydride with 9, 10-diisopropyl-

3,3 (cid:3) ,5,5 (cid:3) -tetramethylbenzidine (TMBZ)]. The presence of the stiff di- 
amines rigidiﬁes the polymer backbone and conﬁnes the chain ro- 
tation.  Incorporating  isopropyl  bridgehead  substituents,  diamines 
with  asymmetric  methyl  groups  and  Trip  moiety  into  KAUST-PI- 
1 and KAUST-PI-2 resulted in a ribbon-like chain growth of these 
polymers, and consequently, ineﬃcient chain packing and signiﬁ- 
cant ultra-microporosity [125] . 

KAUST-PI-1, 2 and 3 have high BET surface areas of 740–760 m 2 
g −1 , which points to the effect of the presence of the isopropyl- 
substituted Trip moiety. The high BET surface areas of KAUST-PI-1, 
2, 3 and 8 imply that the bulkiness, rigidity, and substituent groups 
of the diamine increase the surface area via restricting the rota- 
3 TPDA-DMN), bearing 
tion around the imide bond. KAUST-PI-7 (i-C 
a pair of two fused benzene rings with two methyl groups in the 
diamine structure, has the highest BET surface area among PIs (840 
m 2 /g). 

Among all KAUST-PIs, KAUST-PI-7 has the highest CO

ability  and  the  highest  diffusivity  coeﬃcient  due  to  the  bulky

Fig. 14.  Sample PIM-PIs containing contortion sites in dianhydrides [ 70 , 89 , 92 , 154 ].The inability of previous polymers with SBI and SBF moieties in their dianhydride struc- 
tures to surpass the 2008 Robeson upper bounds has motivated the synthesis of polymers with rigid moieties in dianhydrides [125] . For example, an EA-based dianhydride 
(EADAn) from 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10-hexamethylethanoanthracene reacts with DMN via a polycondensation reaction [150] . The resulting polymer, PIM-PI-EA (PIM-PI-12), has a high 
molecular weight, a BET surface area of 616 m 2 
/g, an exceptional CO 2 permeability (7,340 Barrer), and moderate CO 2 /N 2 and CO 2 /CH 4 selectivities (20 and 16, respectively) 
[150] . Its permeabilities have the order of CO 2 > CH 4 > N 2 . Its CO 2 /N 2 and CO 2 /CH 4 performances are above the 2008 Robeson upper bounds [150] . The PIM-PI-EA has 
excellent CO 2 separation performance due to its impressive diffusivity and solubility selectivities. The presence of the EA moiety (in the dianhydride monomer) and the rigid 
diamine (DMN) lead to excellent CO 2 /N 2 and CO 2 /CH 4 separation performances of PIM-PI-EA membrane [150] . 

structure of DMN, which provides a high surface area and an open 
structure. However, KAUST-PI-7 has the lowest selectivity and sol- 
ubility  selectivity.  The  higher  microporosity  of  KAUST-PI-1  than 
KAUST-PI-1 (cid:3) and KAUST-PI-5 than KAUST-PI-5 (cid:3) and 5 (cid:3) (cid:3) indicates the 
eﬃcacy of the isopropyl-substituent compared to linear diethyl and 
dipropyl substituents. TMPD is a rigid aromatic diamine with four 
methyl groups adjacent to amines. It has been used to develop PIs 
with extraordinary permeability and good selectivity [ 125 , 126 , 149 ].

The outstanding permeability and the satisfactory selectivity of 
KAUST-PI-1 are due to the bimodal pore-size distribution and the 
porous structure of the polymer, pointing to ultra-microporosity of 
KAUST-PI compared to PIM-I and PTMSP ( Fig. 15 ). Small micropores 
improve the sieving ability due to the narrow paths, and the large 
pores boost the CO 
2 permeability via fast gas adsorption and des- 
orption. The branched methyl groups, the small size, and the rigid- 
ity of TMPD generate more ultra-microporosity and sorption sites. 
This causes improvement in permeability and selectivity. KAUST- 
PI-1 has a higher selectivity and a higher CO 
2  permeability than 
KAUST-PI-2,  even  with  its  lower  diffusivity  coeﬃcient.  Switching 
from rigid diamines to more ﬂexible diamines lowers the CO 
2 per- 
meabilities of KAUST-PI-4 and KAUST-PI-6 but increases their se- 
lectivities.  The  KAUST-PI-4  derived  from  Trip  dianhydride  and  4, 
4 (cid:3) -oxydianiline has a considerably low CO 
2 permeability (286 Bar- 
rer) compared to other KAUST-PI-series, while KAUST-PI-1 derived 
from the same dianhydride and TMPD has a high CO 
2 permeabil- 
ity. It is commonly understood that the ethereal oxygen of 4, 4 (cid:3) - 
oxydianiline is responsible for the low permeability and diffusiv- 
ity  coeﬃcient  [125] .  KAUST-PI-1  and  2  can  ﬁll  the  gap  between 
commercial membranes (highly selective and low permeable) and 
highly permeable and low selective PIM membranes. 

PI  membranes  containing  Trip-based  dianhydride  (without 
dioxane rings), dimethyl- and diisopropyl-triptycene-based dianhy- 
dride monomers (TDA1 and TDA i 3, respectively) have superior CO 
2 
separation  performance  ( Fig.  17 ).  Among  these  monomers,  only 
anhydride groups are connected directly to the Trip moiety, and 
therefore the dianhydride monomers do not include any dioxane 
rings  [ 129 , 156 ].  Diisopropyl-substituted-triptycene-TMPD  (TDA i3 - 

15 

TMPD) is not solution-processable in comparison with KAUST-PI- 
1.  PIs  developed  based  on  the  dianhydride  monomers  and  the 
highly sterically-hindered DMN diamine are solution-processable. 
TDA-DMN  polymers  have  high  molecular  weights,  processability, 
and excellent thermal stability. The presence of DMN in the struc- 
ture of PIs leads to the formation of highly permeable membranes 
with  outstanding  surface  areas.  Introducing  dimethyl  bridgehead 
groups to the Trip moiety leads to a surface area of 760 m 2 /g for 
TDA1-DMN. Both PIs have bimodal pore size distributions. TDA1- 
DMN (3,700 Barrer) and TDA i 3-DMN (3,154 Barrer) have high CO 
2 
2 perme- 
permeabilities with moderate selectivities. The higher CO 
ability  of  TDA1-DMN  is  due  to  the  higher  free  volume  veriﬁed 
by broader peaks in the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns 
agreed with its higher aﬃnity to CO 
2  ( Fig. 17 ). Furthermore, the 
better sieving ability of TDA1-DMN is due to the lower interseg- 
mental  distance,  indicated  by  the  smaller  d-spacing  in  its  PXRD 
pattern. The microporous structure, the pore size distribution, and 
the gas transport properties can be tuned with appropriate bridge- 
head substituents. 

The  Trip  moiety  affects  dianhydride  properties  strongly.  Trip- 
containing  dianhydride  (TPDAn)  can  react  with  two  iptycene- 
containing  diamines  (i.e.,  TPDAm  and  PPDA)  to  synthesize 
iptycene-containing  PIs  [157] .  A  bimodal  pore-size  distribution 
with maxima at 3 and 7  ˚A indicates the ultra-microporosity of the 
prepared PIs. Low free volumes of these polymers are due to the 
ﬂexible ether linkages in their backbone, leading to CO 
2  perme- 
abilities less than 39 Barrer, which is much lower than those of 
microporous polymers. 

The  rigid  groups  have  a  remarkable  effect  on  veiling  the  ef- 
2  per- 
fects  of  ﬂexible  groups,  which  may  lead  to  improved  CO 
meability. Ethereal oxygen has a negative impact on pentiptycne- 
based polymers. A pentiptycene dianhydride (PPDAn) can be syn- 
thesized  from  a  pentiptycne  diol.  One-step  imidization  reaction 
of  PPDAn  with  TMPD  forms  an  insoluble  low  molecular  weight 
polymer. Using excess TMPD, an imide containing pentiptycene di- 
amine (PPImDA) is prepared followed by its polymerization with 
6FDA to obtain PPImDA-6FDA as a processable polymer for mem- 
brane fabrication. This polymer has outstanding thermal stability, 
excellent solubility, and a moderate BET surface area of 302 m 2 /g. 
Like  other  pentiptycene  polymers,  PPIMDA-6FDA  has  a  bimodal

CTB2-DMN  have  commendable  thermal  stability  and  high  BET 
surface area of 580 and 469 m 2 g −1 , respectively. Because of the 
high microporosity, CTB1-DMN and CTB2-DMN have shown high 
CO 
2  permeabilities  of  1,661  and  948  Barrer,  respectively.  Their 
gas  selectivities  were  found  to  be  moderate.  These  properties 
have  placed  the  CO 
4  gas  separation  perfor- 
mances of  CTB1-DMN  and  CTB2-DMN below  the  Robeson upper 
bounds.  Furthermore,  CTB2-DMN  has  the  highest  gas  selectiv- 
ity  and  the  lowest  gas  permeability  among  the  DMN-based  PIs 
prepared  from  dianhydrides  with  other  contorted  moieties.  The

membranes  whose  performances  are  above  the  Robeson  upper

5.1. Crosslinking 

Crosslinking  allows  for  preparing  highly  selective  membranes 
for  gas  separation  [160] .  Polymer  solubility  and  membrane  gas- 
transport  properties  can  be  controlled  via  adjusting  the  degree 
of  crosslinking.  Thermal  crosslinking  is  a  method  for  preparing 
crosslinked membranes. In this method, the degree of crosslinking 
of a membrane depends on the reaction temperature, catalyst type 
and amount, and/or reaction time [161] . Thermal stability increases 
with increased degree of crosslinking, which rises with both the 
reaction temperature and duration. Thermal crosslinking of PIM-

the CO 
2 selectivity by 104%, and 
2 /N 
the CO 
4 selectivity by 230% [161] . Increasing crosslinking time 
from 12 to 48 h at 300 °C and from 12 to 24 h at 250 °C resulted 
in a uniform CO 
4 selectivity enhancement of PIM-1 [161] . The 
formation of stable planar triazine rings ( Fig. 20 a) without releas- 
ing any volatile product, increases the PIM-1 stability. The creation 
of triazine rings decreases the inter-chain distance and free vol- 
ume. Therefore, the formation of contracted cavities leads to se- 
lectivity  enhancement.  Fig.  20 b  shows  how  pores  change  during 
thermal crosslinking. The permeability enhancement has been at- 
tributed to the conformational freedom limitations caused by in- 
creased ineﬃcient chain packing. The use of a longer crosslinking 
time led to the creation of more triazine rings, and consequently 

17 

to a higher CO 
lectivity of 41.7, and a higher CO

Thermal  crosslinking  in  an  inert  atmosphere  containing  tiny 
amounts  of  atmospheric  oxygen  leads  to  the  formation  of  cova- 
lently crosslinked polymer chains and increased molecular sieving 
ability [162] . The O 
2 plays a prominent role in the crosslinking pro- 
cess. The degree of crosslinking is controlled by adjusting oxygen 
content, reaction time, and temperature. At a high oxygen level (air 
condition), the reaction time should be short (10 min), because the 
membrane may degrade or crack. The oxidative heat treatment of 
microporous membranes results in the formation of 3D networks 
with tighter pathways and lower chain-to-chain spacing, allowing 
for higher selectivity. The high free volume of a membrane pro- 
vides an opportunity for excellent sorption and diffusion of oxygen

molecules through the spaces between the interconnected microp- 
ores. Performing the reaction under different conditions may affect 
the pore size distribution and the crosslinking extent differently. 

Another  method  of  preparing  crosslinked  membranes  is  con- 
verting the nitrile groups of PIM-1 to carboxyl groups, followed by 
decarboxylation and annealing [163] . The created carboxylic acid 
anhydride is then converted to aryl radicals, and radical combina- 
tion generates biphenyl crosslinking. The abstraction of a hydrogen 
from a methyl group, the loss of a methyl group, and aromatic rad- 
icals provide possible sites for crosslinking. The carboxylated PIM-1 
was crosslinked via annealing at 375 °C for 40 min [163] . The re-

5.2. Thermal treatment 

The  post-thermal  treatment  of  PI  and  polyamide  [164]  ﬁlms 
containing ortho-positioned groups like hydroxyl results in poly- 
mers  containing  benzoxazole  groups  via  thermal  rearrangement 
(TR)  and  thermal  cyclodehydration  (TC)  processes,  respectively 
( Fig.  21 )  [ 94 , 165–169 ].  Thermally-treated  membranes  simultane- 
ously  possess  favorable  permeabilities,  satisfactory  selectivities, 
and good plasticization resistances, making the membranes attrac- 
tive for CO 

2 separation [ 170 , 171 ]. 

Controlling the pore size distribution and the free volume is an 
effective approach to increase diffusion pathways [172] . Micropores 
formed during TR and TC processes provide membranes with at- 
tractive interconnected pores and a high free-volume content. The 
high free-volume is due to the conversion of the packed PIs to het- 
erogeneous  aromatic  rigid-rod  polymers  [173] .  Both  PIM  and  TR 
membranes possess low elongation at break, but TR membranes 
exhibit higher tensile strengths and better mechanical properties 
than PIM membranes [ 174 , 175 ]. On the other hand, the need for 
a completely inert atmosphere, a high temperature for membrane 
preparation,  and  the  brittleness  of  the  obtained  membranes  are 
major drawbacks of this post-modiﬁcation method [ 170 , 176 ].

By  combining  TR  and  PIM  membranes,  four  SBI-containing 
thermally-rearranged  benzoxazole  (SBI-TR-PBO)  membranes  were 
fabricated through the thermal treatment of the corresponding PIs 
[173] . Rearranging the PIs structure using thermal treatment low- 
ers  the  density,  increases  the  free  volume,  improves  the  surface 
area,  and  enhances  the  d-spacing  of  the  SBI-TR-PBO  more  than 
those of SBI-PIs. Furthermore, SBI-TR-PBO has a higher elongation 
at break. 6FDA-SBI-TR-PBO has a signiﬁcantly high CO 
2 permeabil- 
ity  of  675  Barrer,  which  is  six  times  higher  than  that  of  6FDA- 
2 selectivity (22) than that 
SBI-PI (102 Barrer), and a higher CO 
4 selectivity is slightly lower 
of 6FDA-SBI-PI (19), while its CO 
[177] . The extraordinary improvement of the CO 
2  permeability of 
6FDA-SBI-TR-PBO  is  ascribed  to  its  high  free  volume  created  by 
thermal rearrangement and to its high CO

To  synthesize  thermally-rearranged  SBF-based  membranes, 
a  general  method  can  be  used  to  prepare  an  o-hydroxyl- 
functionalized  SBF-based  diamine  monomer  (HSBF)  [ 147 , 178 ].  In 
this method, the precursor PIs for TR-PBOs are prepared using a 
reaction of HSBF, 6FDA, and SBDA. The TR-PBOs have higher ther- 
mal stability than the corresponding PIs. SPDA-HSBF has the high- 
est CO 
2  permeability (568 Barrer) among all hydroxyl-containing 
PIs.  However,  the  BET  surface  area  and  the  diffusion  coeﬃcient 
of  SPDA-SBF-PBO  are  not  considerably  changed  during  the  ther- 
mal processing. The SPDA-SBF-PBO has a 225% improvement in the 
2  permeability compared to SPDA-HSBF due to its higher CO 
CO 
2 
solubility  coeﬃcient,  but  it  has  low-to-moderate  selectivity.  The 
thermal rearrangement of PBO-6FDA-HSBF improved the BET sur- 
face area of the polymer by 4.95 times [ 147 , 178 ]. The microporos- 
ity generated by the thermal rearrangement provided a 5.09 times 
2 diffusion coeﬃcient and a 90% enhancement in the CO

The  full  conversion  of  TDA1-APAF  to  PBO  and  the  partial  main- 
chain  decomposition  were  veriﬁed  using  thermal  gravimetric 
analysis (TGA) [179] . Nitrogen adsorption isotherms showed that

Trip-based  PBO  membranes  were  synthesized  from  Trip- 
containing  polyhydroxyamide  (TPHA)  and  poly(hydroxyimide) 
(TPHI) precursors using TC and TR processes, respectively [138] . A 
higher activation energy for the conversion of the imide to a ben- 
zoxazole group results in a higher temperature demand for the TR 
than TC. In addition to the lower required temperature of the TC 
process, a more mechanically robust membrane is obtained using 
the TC process due to the lower decomposition. The gas transport 
properties  of  TPHA-TC  are  not  higher  than  TRHI-TRs  due  to  the 
less structural change during the TC process. A major increase in 
the FFV evidenced with a higher d-spacing value, and generated 
ultra-microporosity upon the formation of TPHI-TR-450, leading to 
2 permeability (56 times higher) 
signiﬁcant improvement in the CO 
4 selectivity (67) compared to its 
and a 28% increase in the CO 
2 /CH 
original PI. TPHI-TR-400 has a CO 
2 permeability of 320 Barrer and 
4 selectivity of 39 [180] . The exceptional sieving ability of 
a CO 
TPHI-TR-450 is due to the stiffness of the polymer and the inter- 
connectivity of the free volume [180] .

Excellent  chemical  and  thermal  stability  of  carbon  molecular 
sieve  (CMS)  membranes  along  with  their  ability  to  surpass  the 
2008 Robeson upper bounds are promising for the development of 
advanced  membranes  [ 51 , 181–183 ].  Generated  microporosity  be- 
tween plates and ultra-microporosity between strands veriﬁed by 
bimodal pore size distribution allow for tailoring of gas transport 
properties  [51] .  To  date,  there  have  not  been  many  reports  on 
fabricating CMS membranes from an intrinsically microporous PI 

20 

[ 177 , 184 ]. Using heat treatment in three series of distinct stages, 
the PIM-6FDA-OH can be converted to the 6FDA-SBI-PBO (at 440 °C 
for 2 h), then to an intermediate amorphous carbon structure (at 
530 °C for 30 min), and next to a graphitic carbon membrane (at 
above 600 °C for 30 min) [ 177 , 184 ].

Although  6FDA-SBI-TR-PBO  has  a  lower  CO

cient  compared  to  its  corresponding  PI,  its  CO 
three-fold higher due to its higher CO 
2 diffusion coeﬃcient, higher 
microporosity,  and  higher  surface  area  (700  m 2  g −1 )  [ 177 , 184 ]. 
Despite  its  moderate  CO 
4  selectivity  (20),  6FDA-SBI-PBO  re- 
2  permeability  of  4,140  Barrer 
arranged  at  530 °C  displayed  a  CO 
[ 177 , 184 ].  Increasing  the  thermal  treatment  temperature  beyond 
600 °C  alters  the  PI  membranes  to  CMS  membranes  with  par- 
tial  graphitization.  The  construction  of  a  large  portion  of  ultra- 
microporosity especially at 3.58  ˚A determined with CO 
2 adsorption 
4 selec- 
2 /CH 
isotherms and veriﬁed with XRD allowed for high CO 
tivities of 38 and 93 for PIM-CMS-600 and PIM-CMS-800, respec- 
tively [ 177 , 184 ]. 

To achieve high gas permeance and selectivity, sub-100 nm CMS 
membranes were fabricated by depositing a thin layer of SBFDA- 
DMN on a γ -alumina-coated α-alumina ceramic support and us- 
ing  a  protective  polydimethylsiloxane  (PDMS)  layer,  followed  by 
the membranes pyrolysis at different temperatures ( Fig. 22 ) [67] . 
Compared to the bulk, CO 
2 permeability decreases three orders of 
magnitude, while selectivity increases signiﬁcantly indicating en- 
hanced physical aging. The membranes were stable within 1–1.5 
months. 

5.3. Photo-oxidative modiﬁcation 

Photo-oxidative modiﬁcation of a membrane involves the irra- 
diation of its surface using short-wavelength ultraviolet (UV) light 
in  an  oxygen  atmosphere.  This  post-treatment  method  changes 
membranes  morphology  and  performance  [ 79 , 185 , 186 ].  The  ex- 
posure  of  the  membrane  surface  to  UV  light  densiﬁes  the  near- 
top-surface region and forms an asymmetric structure in the UV- 
oxidized membranes. Irradiation time and atmosphere composition 
are two control knobs in UV surface modiﬁcation of PIM-1 [187] .

and oxygen [187] . Performing the modiﬁcation reaction in an oxy- 
gen atmosphere leads to larger changes in the membranes ` per- 
formance than in air. In this technique, highly oxidizing ozone and 
atomic oxygen, generated from oxygen molecules, attack the free 
volume of the membrane, especially in UV-exposed regions. The 
oxidization then leads to chain scission, conﬁrmed by the forma- 
tion of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups [187] . 

The creation of shorter polymer chains increases the eﬃcient 
chain packing via decreasing the intra-chain rigidity and the inter- 
chain distance. Therefore, the accessible microporous free volume 
declines due to the denser top layer. The exposure of PIM-1 to UV 
light for 5 and 10 min in the presence of O 
2  resulted in higher 
4 selectivities without any decrease in the CO 
CO

permeability  [187] .  Increasing  the  exposure  time  from  20  to  40 
min led to CO

ability losses [187] .

UV post-modiﬁcation of PIM-1 can change the contorted struc- 
2 permeability loss and 
ture of the polymer [188] . Considerable CO 
selectivity gain were observed after UV irradiation, which can be 
attributed  to  the  reordering  of  the  polymer  chains  toward  eﬃ- 
cient chain packing [188] . The absence of any signiﬁcant changes in 
the gas solubility coeﬃcients indicates that the membrane perfor- 
mance is controlled by diffusivity and diffusivity selectivity [188] . 
The  rearrangement  of  the  polymer  backbone  leads  to  conforma- 
tional changes and decreases FFV. Two intermediates are formed 
during the formation of the UV-modiﬁed PIM-1 ( Fig. 23 ). The ex- 
posure of the membranes to a UV light for 20 and 30 min was 
found to improve their gas separation performances.

5.4. Chemical post-modiﬁcation 

The  post-functionalization  of  polymers  with  different  groups 
that  possess  a  high  aﬃnity  towards  CO 
2  is  a  convenient  ap- 
proach to improve polymer sieving ability [189] . Tetrazole, triazine, 
amines, hydroxyls, and imidazole are known for their strong in- 
teractions with CO 
2  [190] . Chemical functionalization is the most 
common,  solubility-controlled  method  used  for  acid-gas  removal 
[ 191 , 192 ]. A carrier is provided to adsorb the target gas and form 
a complex to help the so-called solution-diffusion mechanism for 
achieving higher selectivity [193] . However, it is susceptible to car- 
rier saturation especially at high pressures [194] . 

There are two kinds of functionalization carriers: (a) mobile car- 
riers, which can freely move across the membrane, and (b) ﬁxed 
carriers, which are connected to membrane structure via covalent 
bonds. Mobile carriers make membranes more selective than ﬁxed 
carriers. However, the volatility of the solution of mobile carriers 
is a disadvantage. Carriers that are suitable for CO 
2 removal usu- 
ally have basic groups such as amines and carboxylates. The amine 
can be primary, secondary, or tertiary. Reactions between CO 
2 and 
several kinds of amines are [195] : 

+ 
CO 2 + 2RNH 2 ↔ RNHCOO − + RNH 3 

+ 
CO 2 + 2R 2 NH ↔ R 2 NCOO − + R 2 NH 2 

R 3 N + H 2 O + CO 2 ↔ R 3 NH + + HCO 3

Nitrile ( − C ≡ N) groups of PIM-1 are a promising type of func- 
tionality for incorporating different CO 
2 -philic groups. However, in 
most  cases,  the  modiﬁcations lead to  a  decrease in  surface  area 
or available cavities [190] . Fig. 24 shows different chemical post- 
modiﬁcations of PIM-1 for fabricating gas separation membranes. 

5.4.1. Carboxylated functionalized PIMs 

Carboxylate-functionalized PIMs (cPIMs) are attractive polymers 
for gas separation membrane. As cPIMs are soluble in different or- 
ganic solvents like dimethyl sulfoxide and tetrahydrofuran, a free- 
standing  cPIMs  membrane  can  be  fabricated  using  the  conven- 
tional  solution  casting  technique.  cPIMs  with  ∼92  mol  %  of  the 
–COOH were synthesized via a prolonged alkaline hydrolysis pro- 
cess [196] . Moreover, cPIM-1 can be obtained by the full hydrolysis 
of nitrile groups to carboxyl groups [197–199] . cPIM membranes 
have extra CO 
2 aﬃnity and less interchain gaps than PIM-1 mem- 
branes.  As  a  result,  these  membranes  eﬃciently  separate  small- 
size components, e.g. CO 
2 , of a gas mixture owing to the increased 
diffusivity selectivity and less cavity size. Besides, robust interac- 
2  enhance solubility selectivity.

Consequently, the cPIM membrane has shown a CO 
2  selectiv- 
ity of 53.6, which is the highest reported selectivity among avail- 
2 and 
able chemically-modiﬁed PIMs [196] . cPIM-1 has high CO 
CO 
2 permeability. The surface area 
of cPIM-1 is about 50% less than that of PIM-1.

5.4.2. Amidoxime functionalized PIMs 

2 /N 

The substitution of nitrile groups with hydroxyl or amine-based 
moieties is an effective strategy to increase Lewis acid–Lewis base 
interactions with CO 
2  [189] . The fast conversion of nitrile groups 
of  PIM-1  to  amidoxime  moiety  can  be  achieved  using  hydroxy- 
lamine in THF at the reﬂux temperature [ 190 , 200 ]. The resulting 
amidoxime-functionalized PIM-1 (AO-PIM-1) has a 37% lower BET 
surface area (482 m 2 /g) and a 60% lower pore volume than PIM- 
1 [200] . An increase in CO 
2  adsorption at low pressures 
2  and N 
points to the creation of the interconnected cavities and shift to- 
wards ultra-microporosity compared to PIM-1 [200] . The CO 
2 /CH 
4 
2 selectivities of the AO-PIM-1 membrane were found to 
and CO 
be 110% and 45% higher respectively, compared to those of PIM- 
1. The remarkable improvement in diffusivity selectivity indicates 
the narrow porosity of AO-PIM-1, which impedes the transport of 
gas molecules with a large kinetic diameter. The low solubility se-

lectivity is related to the low CO 
The abundance of oxygen and nitrogen of –OH and –NH 
2  groups 
as donors, and the dioxane rings as the acceptor constructs a sta- 
ble network via hydrogen bonds. Although created –OH and –NH 
2 
2 , the restriction 
groups improve the polymer aﬃnity towards CO 
of accessible cavities results in lower gas solubility, especially for 
CO 

2 . 

5.4.3. Heterocyclic tetrazole functionalized PIMs 

2  uptake and a reduction in the N 

Heterocyclic tetrazole rings can be introduced to PIM-1 via the 
so-called click chemistry reaction to increase the solubility selec- 
tivity of CO 
2 over other gases [201] . The strong interactions of the 
tetrazole rings increase the aﬃnity of the tetrazole modiﬁed PIM-1 
2 . Adsorption results show an increase in the 
(TZPIMs) toward CO 
2  solubility due to unprece- 
CO 
dented improvement of the CO 
2 solubility selectivity. However, 
2 /N 
the BET surface area of the modiﬁed PIM-1 decreases to 30 m 2 /g. 
The degree of the reaction and the average molecular weight can 
2 /N 
be adjusted by the ZnCl 
2 
selectivity of 41, a CO 
2 permeabil- 
ity of 3,0 0 0 Barrer were obtained for TZPIM-1. To obtain a PIM- 
based polymer with methyl tetrazol group (MTZ-PIM-1), the TZ- 
PIM-1  must  be  methylated  [202] .  MTZ-PIM-1  has  a  higher  ther- 
mal resistance and better processability than TZ-PIM-1. Compared 
with PIM-1, the MTZ-PIM has a higher CO 
2 sieving ability and 
a lower CO 

2 amount and the reaction time. A CO 

4 selectivity of 22, and a CO 

2 permeability.

5.4.4. Amine functionalized PIMs 

2  groups increases the CO 

The reduction of nitrile groups of PIM-1 to a primary amine us- 
ing borane complexes is another post-modiﬁcation method [203] . 
Although the introduction of –NH 
2  up- 
take in the polymer and the solubility selectivity, the formation of 
hydrogen bonds between amine donor groups and oxygen accep- 
tors in the dioxane rings decrease the free volume of the polymer. 
The CO 
2 permeability and diffusivity decrease due to the strong in- 
teractions of the polymer chains and fewer pathways for gas trans- 
port. A simultaneous decrease in the permeability and selectivity 
of amino-PIM-1 conﬁrm that this modiﬁcation is not adequately 
effective to overcome the upper bounds. 

5.4.5. Thioamide functionalized PIMs 

Nitrile moiety can be replaced with thioamide using phospho- 
rus pentasulﬁde and sodium sulﬁte in a dioxane/ethanol mixture 
[204] . The incorporation of thioamide leads to a 66 % reduction in

To  improve  the  selectivity  of  PIM-1-based  membranes,  PIM-1 
can  be  blended  with  Matrimid-5218.  Almost  all  PIM-1/Matrimid 
membranes have good miscibility. The introduction of 10% PIM-1 
2  permeability with- 
to Matrimid led to a 77% increase in the CO 
out sacriﬁcing CO 
2 selectivities [217] . PIM-1 and 
2 /N 
Ultem PEI form a partially miscible blend at some speciﬁc ratios 
[218] . The addition of less than 20 wt% or more than 90 wt% PIM-1 
to Ultem leads to the formation of homogeneous polymeric blends. 
PIM-1 as an organic dispersed phase can increase gas permeabil- 
ities.  The  addition  of  just  10  %  PIM-1  to  Ultem  matrix  provides 
impressive improvement (167%) in the CO 
2  permeability without 
a  great  loss  in  CO 
2  selectivities  [218] .  Dual-layer 
2 /N

hollow ﬁber conﬁguration can also be formed by blending these 
polymers  [219] .  The  brittleness  of  PIM-1  and  the  jelly  nature  of 
MEEP80  polyphosphazene  can  be  resolved  by  making  composite 
membranes  from  them  with  excellent  ﬂexibility  and  toughness 
[220] . Oligo(ethylene oxide) side groups of MEEP80  enhance the 
2 , leading to excellent per- 
interactions of the membranes with CO 
formance of PIM-1/25 wt% MEEP80 under mixed gas conditions. T g 
measurements verify good miscibility of the components achieved 
through chains entanglement. Taking the advantage of interactions 
between –CN groups of PIM-1 and N atoms in Tröger’s base poly- 
2  selec- 
mers, mechanically robust membranes with enhanced CO 
tivity and plasticization resistance can be fabricated [221] .

To increase the selectivity and plasticization resistance of mi- 
croporous polymers, carboxylated PIM (cPIM-1) can be mixed with 
a  polyamide-imide  (PAI)  such  as  Torlon  [222] .  cPIM-1  is  soluble 
in  common  polar  solvents  like  n-methyl-2-pyrrolidone  (NMP).  A 
791% enhancement in CO 
2  permeability with just a 17% decrease 
in CO 
4  selectivity were achieved with adding 30 wt% cPIM- 
1  to  the  Torlon.  The  creation  of  hydrogen-bonding  between  ac- 
ceptors and donors of  Torlon  and cPIM-1,  as well as the  forma- 
tion of charge transfer complexes improve the interactions, misci- 
bility and compatibility of two polymers, leading to the increase 
of permeability. The embedment of Torlon restricts the chain mo- 
bility of Torlon/cPIM-1 membranes due to the formation of a par- 
tially miscible blend. This leads to an extraordinary advancement 
in the plasticization resistance up to 30 bar. Furthermore, the in- 
corporation of Torlon enhances the gas separation performance of 
the membranes. cPIM-1 is also miscible with Matrimid-5218 veri- 
ﬁed by polarized light microscopy (PLM), atomic force microscopy 
(AFM), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) [223] . 

Plasticization  resistance  of  Matrimid  can  be  signiﬁcantly  en-

deviation of the permeability trend from the logarithmic relation- 
ship expressed in Eq. (1 ).

Crosslinking  with  chemicals  and  additives  is  another  method 
for  modifying  microporous  polymers.  Good  crosslinkers  include 
diazides,  pyrene,  and  1-aminopyrene.  ( Fig.  26 ).  For  instance, 
crosslinking with diazide molecules can be achieved after anneal- 
ing at 175 °C after 7.5 h or at 250 °C for 1 h [ 225 , 226 ]. Crosslink- 
ing with diazide increases CO 
4  selectivities and 
2 /N 
decreases the CO 
2  permeability. Furthermore, adding crosslinkers 
results  in  the  fabrication  of  plasticization-resistant  membranes. 
Crosslinking PIM-1 with pyrene and 1-aminopyrene leads to a con- 
2  solubility selectivity of the 
siderable improvement in the CO 
pristine polymer. Crosslinking PIM-1 with pyrene increases the CO

permeability and the CO 
2 selectivity simultaneously, while PIM-

7. Physical aging of PIM membranes 

Aging has been a long-term challenge in glassy-polymer mem- 
branes  and  has  particular  importance  in  industrial  applications 
[59] . First, it causes higher operation and maintenance costs. Sec- 
ond,  it  complicates  the  long-term  operation  of  membrane  pro- 
cesses [59] . Third, it alters membrane properties. 

Physical aging is caused by a decline in the inter-chain distance 
and free volume of glassy polymers. In other words, at tempera- 
tures far below the polymer T g , physical aging occurs due to a dif- 
ference between polymer speciﬁc volume and the equilibrium vol- 
ume [76] . As polymer chains have some mobility even at a temper- 
ature lower than their T g , the difference leads to the densiﬁcation 
of polymer chains via their segmental motions, porosity loss, and 
consequently decrease in permeability [ 77 , 232 , 233 ]. Stated differ- 
ently, the densiﬁcation results in a decrease in both diffusivity and

solubility, with the former being affected more. However, in some 
cases,  physical  aging  leads  to  favorable  well-adjusted  permeabil- 
ity and selectivity [116] . Membranes exposed to gases with differ- 
ent effective kinetic diameters experience aging differently. To de- 
scribe the effects of aging on membrane separation performance, 
it is better to consider the effective kinetic parameter instead of 
the kinetic diameter, as the latter is a temperature-dependent pa- 
rameter [234] . Gas molecules with smaller effective kinetic diam- 
2  and  He  experience  different  diffusion  mechanisms 
eter  like  H 
in  glassy  polymers,  compared  with  bigger  counterparts  like  CO 
2 
and CH 
4 . The former group ﬁnds the FFV of PIM as an intercon- 
nected  space  and  consequently,  their  permeation  mechanism  is 
more pore-diffusion dominant. The larger gas molecules, however, 
permeate through the membranes based on the solution-diffusion 
principles.  This  difference  in  permeation  mechanism  also  affects 
the response rate of the molecules to aging. In other words, this 
difference causes smaller molecules to show less permeation re- 
duction  upon  aging  [180] .  Thus,  the  permeability  of  a  small  gas 
through a membrane is affected less by the physical aging com- 
pared with the bigger counterparts. Aging is dependent on many 
parameters. For two membranes made of similar materials which 
are  just  different  in  term  of  thickness,  aging  happens  faster  for 
the thinner one. For example, carbon molecular sieve membranes 
(CMS) with 100 nm thickness made of a PIM precursor have three 
orders  of  magnitude  faster  aging,  compared  with  bulk  polymer 
[67] . 

When the thickness of a membrane is less than 100 nm, the 
gas permeability of the membrane decreases quickly due to phys- 
ical  aging.  In  other  words,  the  high  free-volume  of  microporous 
membranes makes them susceptible to physical aging [ 63 , 116 ]. The 

physical aging of PIM membranes occurs over two (short and long) 
time horizons. During the short time horizon (typically 15 days), 
a quick permeability reduction happens due to the fast elimina- 
tion  of  the  additional  non-equilibrium  free-volume  generated  by 
soaking of the membranes in a non-solvent during the membrane 
preparation [ 116 , 235 ]. The gradual gas permeability decrease dur- 
ing the long-time horizon is related to the rearrangement of the 
membrane micropores [116] . Although physical aging causes a de- 
crease in both diffusivity and solubility coeﬃcients (the former be- 
ing affected more), it leads to favorable well-adjusted permeability 
and selectivity [116] . 

Compared to thick ﬁlms, PIM-1 thin ﬁlms ( < 150 nm) undergo 
considerable  initial  aging  [236] .  In  thin  ﬁlms,  aging  is  faster  in 
membranes cast from a more volatile solvent. Because of the high 
aging in PIM-1 thin ﬁlms, their onset of plasticization is low. Addi- 
tionally, CO 
2 exposure showed that the aging effect can overcome 
plasticization after 1.2 min of exposure for thin ﬁlms compared to 
10 h for thick ﬁlms. 

Generally  speaking,  thermal  crosslinking  [161] ,  the  incorpora- 
tion of nanoﬁllers [ 237 , 238 ], alcohol treatment followed by ther- 
mal treatment [ 232 , 239 ], and appropriate storage [63] have been 
found to be effective methods to mitigate physical aging. The ad- 
dition of nanoﬁllers to PIMs is an effective method for suppress- 
ing aging due to the segmental motion restrictions imposed by an 
added nanoﬁller. Nanoﬁllers can be directly incorporated into the 
PIMs or after a surface modiﬁcation to tailor their surface chem- 
istry. Silica is a good example here, as its both pristine and surface 
modiﬁed  versions  are  added  to  PIMs  to  suppress  aging.  For  ex- 
ample, silica functionalized with dimethylbenzoic acid helps PIM-1 
2 /N 
to keep its enhanced CO 
2

been shown that  porous  polymers  like  PIM-1  usually  keep their 
ultimate tensile stress and strain even for a long time, e.g. after 
400 days of aging [244] . Elastic moduli of PIM membranes is an- 
other important mechanical property that should be taken into ac- 
count when these polymers are used as a gas storage media. AFM 
nanoindentation is used to measure elastic moduli of PIM-1 and 
it was found that elastic properties of this polymer vary over its 
thickness. This variation is due to different relaxation procedures 
of the chains at the surface compared with the ones in depth after 
solution casting [245] . In general, mechanical properties and ag- 
ing resistance of PIM membranes strongly depend on their build- 
ing block and chemical groups on their structure. It may be pos- 
sible to synthesize a stiff PIM with high Young’s modulus (10 0 0 
MPa), high tensile strength (47 MPa), and an acceptable elongation 
at break (45%) while keeping its aging resistivity high by tuning 
the functional groups in their structure [ 88 , 243 ]. 

7.1. Effect of contortion site on physical aging 

Aging is dependent on the moiety kind and its chemical groups. 
Rigid  moieties  like  pentiptycene  or  triptycene  are  favorable  in 
terms  of  aging  resistance  [246] .  Moreover,  chemical  groups  in  a 
moiety  can  affect  its  aging  resistivity.  For  example,  –CF 
3  groups 
in BTrip suppress aging in PIM membranes made from such moi- 
eties [88] . Similarly, the presence of the SBI moiety and two diox- 
ane rings in the PIM-1 backbone permit for insuﬃcient chain pack- 
ing thereby getting high free volume. A more rigid structure im- 
parted by the Trip moiety and the phenazine ring demonstrates 
that TPIMs suffer from physical aging more than PIM-1. The im- 
proved sieving ability of TPIMs may be ascribed to the propagation 
of TPIM macromolecules through space in 2D ribbon-like confor- 
mations [116] .

selectivity  after  60  days  while  methanol-treated  PIM-1  or  PIM- 
1 membranes containing other  kinds of  silica cannot  show such 
outstanding gas separation performance under the same operating 
condition [240] . Not only the chemical structure of the nanoﬁller 
affects the aging resistivity of a PIM membrane, but also its ge- 
ometry is inﬂuential. For example, sheet-like nanoﬁllers suppress 
aging much more signiﬁcantly than spherical or cylindrical coun- 
terparts. 

2 )  is  another  method  for  aging  suppression.  ScCO 

Treating  PIM  membranes  via  supercritical  carbon  dioxide 
2  causes 
(scCO 
the  contraction  of  large  micro-cavities  right  after  the  treatment 
process.  Thus,  those  large  micro-cavities  are  already  collapsed 
and there is no chance for them to contract more during mem- 
brane service life [241] . The fabrication of high-performance mem- 
branes with less vulnerability against aging allows for substituting 
currently-used membranes with more eﬃcient ones and reducing 
the capital and operating costs signiﬁcantly. 

Aging also affects the mechanical properties of membranes by 
increasing Young modulus of a polymer [242] . There is a direct re- 
lationship between chain stiffness and Young modulus [243] . It has

Interestingly,  morphological  changes  in  membrane  channels 
upon thermal-oxidative treatment decrease the ﬁrst period of ag- 
ing and improves the membrane stability against long term aging. 
In case of TOX-PIM-1 (thermal-oxidative crosslinked PIM-1), a de- 
crease in permeability occurs over the initial 5 days and then grad- 
ually stabilizes over an extended time of about 1 year. TOX-PIM-1 
2 permeability in the wide range of 
has been reported to have a CO 
297–6,470 Barrer with a CO 
4 selectivity in the range of 10.5–
2 selectivity in the range of 14.4–38.0 [162] . The 
72.4 and a CO 
aging knee for TOX-PIM-1 membranes is shorter than KAUST-PI-1 
[162] . It was found that aging can be affected by the crosslinking 
2  concentration.  For  example,  crosslink- 
atmosphere,  especially  O 
ing of TOX-PIM-1 membranes under O 
2 atmosphere accelerates the 
CO 

2 permeability decline. 
Physical aging can be also slowed by using moieties with stable 
architectures, possessing conﬁguration-induced free-volume [247] . 
PIM-PEIs containing symmetric, H-shaped, contorted pentiptycene 
currently have the best aging resistance among all PIM membranes 
[ 88 , 248 ]. UV-treatment is also another method for the suppress- 
ing of aging in porous polymers [249] . Furthermore, the presence 
of the substituent groups lowers physical aging via decreasing the 
aging driving force and improves interconnections of pores. Table 7 
compares the gas transport properties of different fresh and aged 
PIM membranes; it indicates that physical aging decreases the per- 
meability but increases the selectivity. 

8. PIM-based mixed-matrix membranes 

Mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs), a promising family of hy- 
brid  membranes,  contain  nanoparticles  and  nanostructures  in 
their polymeric matrices [ 154 , 252–255 ]. The inorganic or organic 
nanoparticles are dispersed within the continuous polymeric ma- 
trices [256–259] . Different kinds of nanomaterials such as metal 
oxides [252] , graphene-based nanosheets [ 260 , 261 ], metal organic

frameworks  (MOFs)  [262] ,  covalent  organic  frameworks  (COFs) 
[263] , and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [264] have been used for the 
synthesis  of  PIM-based  MMMs  ( Fig.  28 ).  MMMs  offer  a  solution 
to  the  trade-off between  the  permeability  and  selectivity  of  the 
classical membranes [265] . Good processability of PIMs and excel- 
lent gas-separation ability of the inorganic materials result in high- 
performance PIM-based MMMs that can overcome the 2008 Robe- 
son  upper  bounds  [266] .  These  PIM-based  MMMs  have  the  ad- 
vantages of both PIMs and inorganic materials in terms of perfor- 
mance and stability [267] . Compared to pristine PIM membranes, 
PIM-based MMMs may show enhanced performance [268] . How- 
ever,  the  aggregation  of  the  nanoparticles  and  their  poor  com- 
patibility with PIMs are the main problems concerning PIM-based 
MMMs [269] . Detrimental voids at the nanoparticle/PIMs interface, 
rigidiﬁed PIMs chains around the nanoparticles, and partial pore 
blockage by nanoﬁllers are non-idealities in the MMMs for gas sep- 
aration [270] . Filler size, morphology, and preparation procedures 
are important factors affecting these non-idealities [270] . 

The  effective  permeability  of  a  MMM,  P 

MMM ,  is  predicted 

mostly by the Maxwell model:

respectively.

8.1. Membranes containing silica and its derivatives 

Silica and  its derivatives such  as  fumed silica  and polyhedral 
oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) have been widely used in PIM 
membranes to fabricate MMMs. Fumed silica can increase the per- 
meation and thermal stability of the PIM membranes. One of the 
main challenges is achieving of a homogenous dispersion of silica 
in the PIMs matrix especially at high silica concentrations, exceed- 
ing 24 vol.%. Usually, the poor dispersion of the inorganic nanopar- 
ticles  in  PIMs  leads  to  an  aggregate  formation.  Such  aggregates 
may  create  voids  in  the  system  which  ﬁnally  affect  permeation 
properties of the PIM-based MMMs. These voids usually are gen- 
erated  at  PIM/ﬁller  interface  or  between  ﬁller  aggregates.  When 
the level of SiO 
2 loading into PIM-1 exceeds 30 vol.%, brittle PIM 
membranes are formed, which are not useful from a practical point 
of view. Thus, the silica concentration at which ﬂexible to brittle 
transition  happens,  usually  24  vol.%,  is  considered  as  the  maxi- 
mum threshold of the silica addition. Near 100% improvement in 
2 permeability is achieved when the volume fraction of sil- 
the CO 
ica is around 20 vol.%. On the other hand, the CO 
2  selectivity 
decreases from 15.0 to 7.8 under the same circumstances. In sum- 
mary, the incoporation of unmodiﬁed inorganic ﬁllers like fumed 
silica improve the CO 
2 se- 
lectivity  due  to  the  unselective  voids  in  the  PIM-based  MMMs 
[252] . The Maxwell model is unable to the gas permeabilities of 
these membranes.

2 permeability and CO 

POSS nanoparticles were embedded into the PIM-1 matrix to 
improve its CO 
4 selectivity [277] . These 
are  very  tiny  nanoparticles  in  the  range  of  1.5–3.0  nm  possess- 
ing a porous structure. Functionalization of the POSS with various 
functionalities including alkyl, oleﬁn, epoxy, alcohol, acid, amine, 
and sulfonate allows for improving the ﬁller dispersion in differ- 
ent polymeric matrices. Also, the ﬁller has a cage-like structure in 
the size range of 1-3 nm, making it suitable for use as the dis- 
persed phase of CO 
2 -separating MMMs. These 3D ﬁllers are modi- 
ﬁed to create an organic outer layer on their surface. The presence 
of  the  layer  improves  the  dispersion  of  the  nanoparticles  in  the 
common solvents, enhances its dispersion in the PIM-1 matrix and 
eliminates ﬁller/matrix interfacial non-selective gaps. The incorpo- 
ration  of  20  wt%  unmodiﬁed  POSS  into  PIM-1  matrix  increased 
2  permeability up to 220% compared with the pure PIM-1 
the CO 
[277] . However, no improvement in the selectivity was observed. 
The enhancement in permeability without any improvement in se- 
lectivity is due to the generation of non-selective passages in the 
ﬁller/PIM-1 interface. On the other hand, PIM-1 containing amine- 
functionalized POSS (OAPS) particles shows a completely different 

2 /N 

2 permeabil- 
behavior. The addition of OAPS slightly decreased CO 
ity but increased CO 
2 selectivity up to 250% compared with the 
pure PIM-1 [277] . At 20 wt% loading of OAPS, a gradual agglomera- 
tion of the ﬁllers happened, and a large selectivity increase was ob- 
served due to the strong hydrogen bond formation between the ni- 
trile groups of PIM-1 and the amine groups of the ﬁller. The strong 
hydrogen bonds change the PIM-1 ` s chain rigidity, leading to the 
signiﬁcant selectivity improvement. The addition of 5 wt% OAPS ef- 
fectively suppresses aging of PIM-1through the formation of a ﬁne 
dispersion in the polymer matrix and the establishment of inter- 
actions with PIM-1 [277] . The free volume among rigid chains dis- 
appears more slowly than the ﬂexible chains, and this is the ra- 
tionale behind the resolution of the aging problem upon the addi- 
tion of the modiﬁed, well-dispersed ﬁllers. The modiﬁcation of the 
POSS with an amine or nitro group is a successful strategy to im- 
prove POSS interactions with the PIM-1 matrix, which makes PIM- 
1 chains more rigidiﬁed and mitigates the aging problem. 

The octa-phenethyl POSS (PhE-POSS) can be added to the PIM- 
1 matrix to prevent physical aging and improve the CO 
2 transport 
of the nanocomposite membranes [278] . MMM containing 1 wt%

of the ﬁller has higher CO 
2 permeability and diffusivity coeﬃcient 
than  the  PIM-1  membrane.  The  presence  of  PhE-POSS  decreases 
chain  packing  after  ﬁlm  casting  which  causes  higher  membrane 
permeability compared to the pure PIM-1 membrane. At high up- 
stream pressures near 20 bar, the CO 
2  permeability of the PIM-1 
with 1 wt% PhE-POSS decreases signiﬁcantly to around 3,100 Bar- 
rer due to the collapse of open, loosened morphology of the PIM-1 
containing 1 wt% PhE-POSS. 

Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) functionalized POSS nanoﬁllers can 
be  incorporated  into  PIM-1  to  take  the  advantage  of  dipole- 
quadrupole interactions between ethylene oxide units of PEG and 
CO 
2 molecules [279] . Although the main improvement here origi- 
2 with ethylene oxide groups, the 
nates from the interactions of CO 
direct addition of PEG to PIM-1 is not useful enough as PEG/PIM- 
1 blend undergoes a phase separation. To address this issue, PEG 
chains can be covalently anchored on the nanoﬁllers, and the mod- 
iﬁed nanoﬁllers can then be added to PIM-1 matrix to obtain ho- 
mogeneously dispersed solutions. Selecting POSS as an anchoring 
site is reasonable as it has nanometer size (1-3 nm) and can be 
dispersed ﬁnely in most of polymeric matrices. Also, POSS has an 
organic-inorganic structure and thus makes a favorable polymer- 
ﬁller interface [ 18 , 280 , 281 ]. Finally, POSS can be easily modiﬁed to 
bear different kinds of functionalities.

2 and CO 

4 selectivity increases signiﬁcantly. 

PEG anchored POSS were incorporated into PIM-1 membrane to 
enhance its CO2 selectivity [279] . CO 
2 permeability decreased from 
3,795 Barrer (pure PIM-1) to 1,309 Barrer (10 wt% ﬁller contain- 
4 selectivities increased from 19 to 
ing), while CO 
31 and 12 to 30, respectively [279] . The main reasons behind CO 
2 
permeability drop with the ﬁller incorporation are chain rigidiﬁca- 
tion and induced barrier effects. By the barrier effect, it means that 
the POSS nanoparticles may partially block intrinsic pores of PIM- 
1, create more tortuous gas diffusion pathways and thereby make 
the gas diffusion process more diﬃcult. Despite the reduction in 
CO 

2 permeability, the CO 
Disilanol  isobutyl  POSS  (SO1440)  is  highly  dispersible  in 
dichloromethane, which is a common solvent for PIM-1 as well. 
The addition of just 0.5 wt% of the ﬁller to the PIM-1 matrix in- 
creases the CO 
2  permeability by 64% compared with pure PIM-1 
[282] . This permeability improvement is due to the increased free 
volume caused by the presence of bulky SO1440 particles. In other 
2 permeability is improved because of an increase in 
words, the CO 
2  diffusivity coeﬃcient. However, a further increase in the 
the CO 
ﬁller level leads to a decrease in CO 
2 permeability due to the PIM- 
1 chain rigidiﬁcation and space-ﬁlling by the ﬁllers. The presence 
of a high amount of the ﬁller ( > 0.5 wt%) blocks intrinsic pores of 
PIM-1 or narrows its pore size distribution, which makes it diﬃ- 
2  molecules to pass through the passages. On the 
cult for the CO 
other hand, both CO 
4 selectivities increase, as the 
ﬁller loading content increases from 2 to 10 wt% [282] . In this ﬁller 
loading range, not only d-spacing of PIM-1 chains decreases but 
2  and - 
also the chance of hydrogen bond formation between CO 
SiOH groups of SO1440 increases. At a very high ﬁller concentra- 
tion, 20 wt%, ﬁller agglomeration happens and both permeability 
and selectivity decrease [282] . A –SiOH functional group can in- 
teract with both CO 
2 , as it can establish hydrogen bonds 
with both of them. This implies that there is a competitive sorp- 
tion between CO

8.2. Membranes containing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) 

Multiwall  carbon  nanotubes  (MWCNTs)  have  also  been  dis- 
persed in PIM-1 to make CO 
2 permeable membranes [264] . As in 
the case of other ﬁllers, a homogenous dispersion of MWCNTs is 
needed  to  prepare  a  high-performance  membrane.  This  necessi- 
tates the functionalization of the MWCNTs by PEG chains. By using 

29 

the “grafting to” method [264] , the PEG chains can be covalently 
bonded  to  the  surface  of  the  MWCNTs,  f-MWCNTs.  Grafted  PEG 
chains on the surface of the MWCNTs not only facilitate their ﬁne 
dispersion in the PIM-1 matrix but also increase the aﬃnity of the 
system for CO 
2 adsorption through favorable interactions between 
PEG and CO 

2 molecules. 

Unfunctionalized  MWCNTs  cannot  be  dispersed  in  the  PIM-1 
matrix ﬁnely, as their π - π interactions are stronger than their in- 
teractions  with  the  PIM-1  matrix.  However,  the  PEG  chains  de- 
bundle their structure and facilitate their dispersion in the poly- 
mer matrix [283] . The dispersion of the functionalized MWCNTs 
is feasible up to 2 wt% of the ﬁller. However, MMMs containing 
3 wt% of MWCNTs showed ﬁller aggregation, defects, and voids at 
the interface of the ﬁller and the PIM-1 chains [283] . As a result, 2 
wt% of the MWCNT is the optimum concentration for achieving the 
best gas transport properties. PIM-1, f-MWCNT/PIM-1, and pristine 
MWCNT/PIM-1 membrane have CO 
4  selectivities 
of (28.2, 15.4), (32.9, 10.4), and (16.3, 8.1), respectively [283] .

been  reported  to  be  5,360  and  8,230  Barrer,  respectively  [283] . 
Permeability  increases  due  to  the  transport  of  CO 
2  molecules 
through  the  free  volume  of  PIM-1  and  MWCNTs `  channels.  The 
main reason for the permeability improvement is a disruption in 
PIM-1 chain packing due to its interactions with PEG. This trend 
may  be  explained  by  analyzing  the  contribution  of  diffusivity 
to  the  overall  permeation  of  CO 
2 .  The  diffusivity  coeﬃcient  has 
been  reported  to  increase  from  7.91 × 10 −7 cm 2 /s  for  pure  PIM-1 
to  19.4 × 10 −7  cm 2 /s  for  PIM-1  containing  2  wt%  functionalized 
MWCNTs.  However,  it  decreased  to  6.72  (10 −7  cm 2 /s)  when  the 
ﬁller concentration increased to 3 wt% [283] . This trend indicates 
that at lower ﬁller concentrations ( < 2 wt%), the interface between 
the functionalized MWCNTs and PIM-1 chains is continuous and 
there is no gas diffusion resistance. On the other hand, at higher 
concentrations  of  the  ﬁller  ( >  2  wt%),  the  generated  nano-gaps 
between polymer chains and the MWCNTs become discontinuous, 
which  serve  as  a  barrier  to  gas  diffusion.  Nevertheless, the  sep- 
aration performance of all of the PIM-1 based MMMs containing 
0.5–3.0  wt%  of  the  functionalized  MWCNTs  surpass  the  2008 
2 Robeson upper bound. It is worth noting that the solubil- 
CO 
ity coeﬃcient of CO 
2 in the MMM increases slightly in the entire 
range of the ﬁller addition (0.5–3.0 wt%). The reason is that there 
is a strong aﬃnity between the ethylene oxide units of PEG and 
CO 
2  molecules. Thus, the unexpected non-monotonic relationship 
between  the  permeability  and  the  ﬁller  loading  level  originates 
from  the  polymer/ﬁller  interface  and  diffusivity  resistance.  The 
loading  amount  of  the  f-MWCNTs  also  affects  selectivity  greatly. 
2 selectivity was achieved at 3 wt% of the ﬁller. 
The highest CO 
It  is  believed  that  the  interfacial  interactions  are  highest  at  this 
concentration, leading to the highest selectivity. In general, MMMs 
containing f-MWCNTs show better permeability, improved CO 
2 /N

selectivity, and higher long-term stability compared with MMMs 
containing pristine MWCNTs, thanks to homogenous dispersion in 
the PIM-1 matrix and the creation of defect-free ﬁller/polymer in- 
terfaces [283] . The addition of f-MWCNTs to a bis(phenyl)ﬂuorene- 
based  PIM  (Cardo-PIM-1)  — synthesized  via  the  dibenzodioxane

8.3. Membranes containing organic nanoparticles 

The  addition  of  organic  particles  to  PIM-1  leads  to  the  cre- 
ation  of  voids  at  the  PIM/particle  interface  and  causes  selectiv- 
ity  reduction.  Among  organic  particles  is  a  highly  crosslinked, 
porous, imidazole-functionalized particle named BILP-10. Two dif- 
ferent kinds of amine are present in the chemical structure of this 
nanoparticle. The ﬁrst one is a tertiary amine, which improves its 
aﬃnity to CO 
2 , and the second one is a secondary amine, which 
facilitates hydrogen bond formation between the ﬁller and PIM-1. 
This nanoparticle does not dissolve in common solvents like chlo- 
roform [285] . Thus, its dispersion in the PIM-1/chloroform solution 
to prepare an MMM is feasible. Thanks to its imidazole function- 
alities, the nanoparticles form hydrogen bonds with PIM-1, which 
improve their dispersion in the PIM-1 matrix. PIM-1/BILP-10 MMM 
with  30  wt%  ﬁller  has  a  high  CO 
2  permeability  (increased  from 
470 0  to  720 0  Barrer,  meaning  53%  improvement).  Not  only  the 
voids at the PIM-1/BILP-10 interface, but also pathways inside the 
porous structure of the BILP-10 contribute to the increase of the 
free volume of the MMM. Up to 30 wt% of the ﬁller loading, the 
CO 
2 permeability increases monotonously, which is ascribed to the 
generation of more free volumes in the system. However, a ﬁller 
loading  above  this  critical  value  leads  to  a  permeability  reduc- 
tion. For example, a membrane containing 40 wt% of the BILP-10 
shows CO 
2 selectivity of 19.3 
for pure PIM-1 decreases to 15.1 and 15.3 for 17.0 and 30.0 wt% 
ﬁller loadings, respectively. The selectivity reduction is due to the 
presence of extra pathways created by the porous ﬁller letting N 
2 
diffusion and consequently causing selectivity reduction. The best

Figure 28B shows that hyper-crosslinked polymeric nanoporous 
particles  (HCP)  can  be  used  as  the  dispersed  phase  in  PIM-1  to 
suppress its aging. HCP polystyrene particles with an average di- 
ameter of 55 nm can be synthesized by emulsion polymerization 
and incorporated into PIM-1. The advantage of emulsion polymer- 
ization  over  other  conventional  methods  for  preparing  nanopar- 
ticles  is  its  ability  in  precise  control  of  nanoparticle  size  [286] . 
Thus, the use of non-aggregated, narrow-size-distributed nanopar- 
ticles  obtained  by  emulsion  polymerization  in  a  MMM  does  not 
leave  large  polymer/particle  interfacial  defects.  This  means  that 
non-selective  diffusion  routes  which  sacriﬁce  selectivity  are  not 
created. The CO 
2  permeation of the MMMs containing such HCP 
polystyrene  ﬁller  increases  monotonously  from  8,0 0 0  to  about 
21,0 0 0  Barrer  upon  the  addition  of  nearly  22  wt%  of  the  ﬁller. 
2 selectivity decreases from 15.0 to 9.5 under 
However, the CO 
this circumstance [272] . The main reason behind such a signiﬁcant 
increase in the CO 
2  permeability is the high surface area of the 
HCP, which is two times greater than the surface area of the pure 
PIM-1, 1,700 vs. 750-850 m 2 /g. So, as the ﬁller concentration in- 
creases in MMMs, their CO 

2 permeability improves. 

2 /N 

The  aging  of  the  HCP  polystyrene/PIM-1  membranes  can  be 
also minimized by using such HCP ﬁllers. The pores of the HCP 
ﬁllers are more stable than the pores of other usual nanoporous 
ﬁllers  due  to  their  crosslinked  structure.  Thus,  the  pores  do  not 
collapse over time easily and thereby endow the MMMs with high 
aging resistance. On the other hand, ethanol treatment, which is 
used as a technique for improving permeability affects aging re- 
sistance negatively. For example, CO 
2 permeation loss of an MMM 
cast from dichloromethane, which contains 16.67 wt% HCP ﬁller af- 
ter 150 days is about 9.4%, while for the same membrane over the 

30 

2 permeation loss increases to 28% just due to 
same period the CO 
2 permeability of the 
the ethanol treatment. As aging decreases N 
2  selectivi- 
MMMs more than their CO 
ties increase over time. Interestingly, PIM-1 thin-ﬁlm nanocompos- 
ite (TFN) membranes containing 60 wt% of HCP can be produced 
[287] . The Maxwell model can be used to predict CO 
2 permeabil- 
ity of PIM-1/HCP membranes.

Two  dimensional  (2D)  nanomaterials  such  as  graphene, 
graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets (g-C 
4 ) and MXene are com- 
posed of a single or few-atomic-thick layer. 2D nanoparticles sig- 
niﬁcantly  improve  the  ability  of  free-standing  PIM-based  MMMs 
2 removal applications. For example, the addition of 1 wt% of 
for CO 
the g-C 
4 nanosheets to the PIM-1 increased the FFV of the mem- 
3 N 
brane from 22 to 24.2% and decreased the density of the mem- 
brane from 1.117 to 1.086 g/cm 3 [288] . The latter values, however, 
changed to 22.9% and 1.105 g/cm 3 as the ﬁller content increases to 
2 wt%. The addition of up to 1 wt% of the ﬁller decreased the pack- 
ing of PIM-1 chains, but increased FFV, creating more passages for 
gas transport. On the other hand, at a high loading level around 
1.5 and 2.0 wt%, restacking of nanosheets lowered FFV, increased 
the membrane density, and decreased the number of pathways for 
gas  transport.  The  CO 
2  permeability  of  the  pure  “as-cast” PIM-1 
membranes was 3,425 Barrer. The permeability increased to 5,785 
Barrer with the addition of 1 wt% of the nanosheets and decreased 
to 3,381 Barrer (which is lower than that of pure PIM-1) with the 
addition of 2 wt% of the ﬁller [288] .

2 and CO 

Similar  to  the  FFV  analysis,  the  improvement  in  CO 

2  perme- 
ability  at  low  ﬁller  concentrations  can  be  attributed  to  the  re- 
duced PIM-1 chain packing and increased free volume caused by 
the ﬁller. On the other hand, decreased permeability at high ﬁller 
contents can be ascribed to the blockage of interconnected, porous 
pathways of the PIM-1 matrix. The effect of the ﬁller level on the 
CO 
4 selectivities is, however, completely different. 
For both gas mixtures, selectivity decreases monotonously as the 
ﬁller content increases from 0.0 to 1.5 wt% mainly due to the cre- 
ation of non-selective voids at the ﬁller/polymer interface [288] . In 
3 N 
contrast, the MMM with 2.0 wt% of g-C 
4 has a little improved 
4 permeabilities to those 
2 and CH 
selectivity but almost similar CO 
of  pure  PIM-1[288].  In  other  words,  the  MMM  follows  the  gen- 
eral selectivity-permeability trade-off rule. Methanol treatment of 
4 /PIM-1  membranes  affects  their  permeability  signiﬁcantly. 
g-C 
For  all  ﬁller  levels,  the  permeability  doubled.  For  example,  CO 
2 
4 increases 
permeability of ‘as-cast ` MMM containing 1 wt% g-C 
from 5,785 to 10,528 Barrer upon methanol treatment [288] . This 
signiﬁes that methanol treatment affects chain packing and chain 
arrangement severely.

From the selectivity point of view, alcohol-treatment decreases 
selectivity in comparison with the ‘as-cast ` MMMs. However, both 
‘as-cast ` and ‘alcohol-treated ` membranes show similar trends to- 
ward ﬁller loading. So, it seems 2D, ultra-microporous ﬁllers such 
as g-C 
4  are ideal candidates for MMMs manufacturing due to 
their high surface area and their ability in debundling the PIM-1 
chains. They can improve permeability at concentrations as low as 
1 wt% thanks to their high aspect ratio. Aging and thermal stability 
are other properties that are improved by the incorporation of 2D 
ﬁllers. 

8.5. Membranes containing covalent organic frameworks (COFs) 

Porous  micron-sized  aromatic  framework  particles  like  PAF-1 
can mitigate the aging of PIM-1 [273] . These particles have a sur- 
face  area  around  5,200  m 2 /g  and  possess  great  aﬃnity  for  CO 
2 . 
When they are incorporated into PIM-1, they anchor to the bulky

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 84 (2021) 100903 

moieties of the polymer, freezing the free volume of as-cast mem- 
branes,  and  suppressing  the  aging.  In  other  words,  several  seg- 
ments  of  PIM-1  chains  are  adsorbed  in  the  pores  of  the  porous 
ﬁller keeping the PIM-1 chains unpacked over time. 

Fig.  28 D  shows  the  building  block  of  the  PAF-1  and  dis- 
plays schematically its incorporation into a PIM-1 membrane. The 
schematic shows how aging causes a decrease in free volume in 
the absence of the PAF-1 and how the aging phenomenon is sup- 
pressed  in  the  presence  of  the  PAF-1.  PIM-1/PAF-1  MMMs  show 
just a 7% decrease in permeability after 240 days. During this pe- 
2 per- 
riod, however, pure PIM-1 shows a 62% decrease in the CO 
meability [273] . In addition, PIM-1/PAF-1 has a high CO 
4  se- 
2 /CH 
2 permeability of about 15,0 0 0 
lectivity of around 20 and a high CO 
Barrer [273] . 

A porous nanoparticle named SNW-1 can be synthesized thor- 
ough the reaction of melamine and terephthalaldehyde [263] . The 
nanoparticle consists of many –NH groups that facilitate CO 
2  ad- 
sorption when used as the dispersed phase in the PIM-1 matrix. 
Moreover,  the  nanoparticles  are  dispersed  homogenously  in  the 
PIM-1  matrix  due  to  the  formation  of  hydrogen  bonds  between 
–NH groups of  the SNW-1 and C  ≡ N and dioxane  rings of the 
PIM-1. The surface area of the ﬁller is about 780 m 2 /g and its CO 
2 
uptake at pressures of 2 and 30 bars have been reported to be 40 
and 161 cm 3 /g, respectively [263] . Because of the high speciﬁc sur- 
face area, high microporosity, and amine groups of the ﬁller, SNW- 
1 containing MMM are suitable for CO 
2 removal. 10 wt% of SNW-1 
was its optimum loading for the fabrication of high-performance 
nanocomposite membranes for CO 
2 permeability in- 
creases monotonously from 3,672 (for pure PIM-1) to 7,553 Bar- 
rer for PIM-1/SNW-1 (10 wt%) [263] . However, a further increase 
in the ﬁller content does not change the selectivity signiﬁcantly, 
2 permeability from 7,954 to 6,460 Bar- 
while it decreases the CO 
rer [263] . In the range of the SNW-1 < 10 wt%, the main reason 
for improving CO 
2 permeability is an increase in the free volume 
of the matrix conﬁrmed by augmentation in the d-spacing of the 
PIM-1  chains.  In  other  words,  the  CO 
2  permeability  is  improved 
2 diffusivity coeﬃcient. However, at the higher 
due to increased CO 
SNW-1 loading, about 20 wt%, diffusion pathways created by the 
PIM-1 are blocked by the SNW-1 causing permeability decline. As 
for CO 
2 selectivities of the MMMs, 10 wt% addi- 
tion of the SNW-1 to the PIM-1 caused 27.4 and 37.6% improve- 
ments compared to pure PIM-1, respectively [263] . The main rea- 
son behind such increases in selectivities is the establishment of 
acid-base interactions between -NH groups of the SNW-1 and CO 
2 
molecules.

The  addition  of  a  MOF  to  MMMs  improves  CO 
2 /N 

2  permeability 
without sacriﬁcing the CO 
2  selectivity through three different 
methods. First, the MOFs themselves have a porous structure. So, 
CO 
2  molecules  can  directly  diffuse  through  the  MOFs `  channels 
when a high amount of the ﬁller is loaded. Second, their presence 
in the PIM-1 matrix can produce more free volume in the PIM- 
1/MOF interface. Third, MOFs can be functionalized to show high 
2  molecules, thereby improving the gas uptake 
aﬃnity toward CO 
of the MMMs. MOFs have organic-inorganic nature and their pres- 
ence in MMMs leads to the generation of less non-selective macro- 
voids [ 289 , 290 ]. Having this background, various Ti x UiO-66 ( x = 1, 
5, 10, 15) can be synthesized from UiO-66 by post-synthetic trans- 
metallation [291] . The presence of the titanium in the molecular 
structure of the ﬁller improves the polymer/ﬁller interactions. 

Fig. 28 E shows how the titanium exchange improves the inter- 
actions of the MOF with the PIM-1 and consequently its disper- 
sion in the matrix. Ti substitution decreases the crystallinity of the 
UiO-66 and gives it a higher chance to interact with the PIM-1 ` s

5 UiO-66 is added to PIM-1, the CO 
2 
permeability increases from around 3,800 to 13,500 Barrer, repre- 
senting a 274% permeability improvement without a selectivity loss 
[291] . Under these circumstances, the CO 
2 selectivity remains in 
the range of 20 to 24 even in long term periods [291] .

PIM-1  is  a  hydrophobic  material  consisting  of  aromatic  re- 
peat units. It is immiscible with hydrophilic nanomaterials such as 
silicalite-1 crystals (MFI). To obtain ﬁne dispersion of the ﬁller in 
the PIM-1 matrix without detecting any interfacial voids, the outer 
surface of the silicalite-1 crystals must be functionalized by aro- 
2 Ph.  A  35.5  vol.%  addition  of  the  ﬁller  to 
matic  moieties,  -(CH 
PIM-1  decreases  the  CO 
2  permeability  from  4390  (for  the  pure 
polymer)  to  2,530  Barrer  (for  the  MMMs)  while  increases  the 
2 selectivity from 24 to 30 [292] . The decrease in the perme- 
CO 
ability and the increase in the selectivity imply that MMMs con- 
taining MFI crystals are less permeable but more selective com- 
pared  to  PIM-1.  This  indicates  the  absence  of  voids  at  the  PIM- 
1/MFI interface and ﬁller agglomeration.

Motivated  by  the  high  speciﬁc  surface  area  of  the  MIL-101 
(40 0 0 m 2 /g) and its high thermal and chemical stabilities [293] , 
the porous nanoparticles can be incorporated into the PIM-1 ma- 
trix  to  prepare  MMMs  [293] .  33  vol.%  of  the  MIL-101  is  loaded 
into  the  PIM-1  matrix,  as  it  is  expected  that  gas  transport  im- 
provements  happen  in  loading  levels  only  higher  than  20  vol.%. 
The  strong  interactions  of  the  ﬁller  and  the  PIM-1  matrix  origi- 
nate from the strong non-covalent bond formation between diox- 
ane groups of PIM-1 and metal cations in the MIL-101 [293] . CO 
2 
permeabilities of 3,250 and 8,440 Barrer have been reported for 
2  se- 
PIM-1  and PIM-MIL-101,  respectively  [293] .  Also,  the  CO 
lectivity  has  been  reported  to  increase  from  19  to  36  upon  the 
addition of the ﬁller. Here, the CO 
2  permeability improvement is 
mainly attributed to the diffusivity coeﬃcient enhancement of the 
2 ,  as  its  value  increased  from  4.1 × 10 −7  to  8.4 × 10 −7  cm 2 /s, 
CO 
2 solubility coeﬃcient remained unchanged upon the 
while the CO 
addition of the ﬁller [293] . As a result, it can be concluded that the 
mesoporous MIL-101 nanoparticles are effective ﬁllers, as they can 
concurrently improve permeability and selectivity of the PIM-1.

To develop highly eﬃcient PIM-based MMMs containing MOFs

be considered as Lewis acids; they are able to anchor the ILs to 
prevent their leakage in practical applications. Besides, the pres- 
ence of amine groups on the MOFs facilitates their homogenous 
dispersion in the PIM-1 matrix. The optimum permeability and se- 
lectivity were achieved upon 5 wt% loading of the TSIL-containing 
2  permeability  and 
MOF,  which  caused  23%  improvement  in  CO 
119% (from 17 to 37) enhancement in CO 
2 selectivity, compared 
to  the  pure  PIM-1  [275] .  Such  a  signiﬁcant  improvement  in  the 
MMMs performance can be attributed to the increase in the inter- 
nal space of the MMMs and the facile CO 
2 transport through the 
MOF’s already available channels. Thanks to the presence of amine 
groups, TSIL is a CO 
2 -philic material but does not show any aﬃnity 
towards N 
2 . When it anchors on the MOF surface, it decreases the 
pore volume of the MOF, which leads to a reduction in the adsorp- 
2 . However, this reduction is more 
tion capacity of both CO 
2 and the TSIL.

Besides, the measured solubility values show a slight decrease in 
the N 
2 by the 
TSIL-containing MOF. At higher loadings, like 10 wt%, several voids 
are formed at the ﬁller/PIM-1 interface. These voids create a very 
2 molecules to cross over the membrane resulting 
easy way for N 
in a CO 
2  selectivity reduction. As a result, three different fac- 
tors can be mentioned for such extraordinary performance of this 
MMM. First, IL plays an important role in the system, as it is a se- 
2 carrier. Second, the ﬁller itself has a porous structure, 
lective CO 
which increases the CO 
2 -MIL-101(Cr) 
2 permeability. Third, the NH 
can control the dispersion of the IL to create more active sites for 
gas molecules.

Amine-functionalized  MOFs  such  as  NH 
ized with amino group) and UiO-66-(COOH) 
2 (functionalized with 
two carboxylic groups) can be embedded into PIMs with different 
4 gas mixtures eﬃciently 
moieties to separate CO 
[294] . As the pure PIM-1 intrinsically shows high CO 
2 permeabil- 
ity, the main aim here is improving PIM-1 selectivity via the ad- 
dition of the MOFs. The MOFs size can be adjusted from micron- 
size to nano-size through water modulation and functionalization 
[294] . The dispersion of the nano-size MOFs in the PIM-1 matrix 
is such ﬁne that it creates a fully transparent ﬁlm in contrast to 
the micron-size counterpart. Considering just the effect of UiO-66 
particle  size  on  gas  transport  properties,  very  different  behavior 
is observed between micron- and nano-size particles [294] . At a 
high MOFs loading level, the MMMs containing micron-size MOFs 
have  double  permeability  and  a  little  bit  decrease  in  selectivity, 
compared to pure PIM-1, which is a usual behavior caused by the 
generation of non-selective voids in the MOFs/PIM interface [294] . 
On the other hand, the high loading level of the nano-size UiO-66 
causes a decrease in the permeability and an increase in the ideal 
selectivity [294] . 

The rigidiﬁcation of PIM-1 chains upon the addition of UiO-66 
causes the selectivity increase and permeability decrease. However, 
at a low level of ﬁller loading, the permeability decrease is negli- 
gible.  The  improvements  are  more  signiﬁcant  in  the  case  of  the 
2 ) 
addition of amine-functionalized, nano-size UiO-6 6 (UiO-6 6-NH 
and the optimum permeability and selectivity are obtained in the 
ﬁller loading range of 5-10 wt%. Increasing more UiO-66-NH 
2 than 
this optimum range decreases permeability due to the formation of 
non-porous aggregates of the nano-size MOFs. Upon 5-10 wt% ad- 
dition of the nano-sized UiO-66-NH 
2 , the MMMs easily surpass the 
2 Robeson upper bound and reach ideal selectivities of 
2008 CO 
2 /N 
27 and 28 for CO 
4 , respectively. They also keep 
2 /CH 
their high permeability thanks to the existence of additional gas 
diffusion paths created by the porous MOF. As a result, it should 
be emphasized that not only the functionality but also the size of 
the ﬁller affects the MMMs performance. Nano-sized ﬁllers have a 
good dispersion in the PIM-1 matrix. They reduce the possibility 
of forming non-selective voids, which leads to selectivity improve-

The properties of AO-PIM-1 are excellent to host NH 

2 -UiO-66 
for making MMMs. To synthesize AO-PIM-1, all or some of the - 
CN  groups  of  PIM-1  should  be  converted  into  -CN 
3  and  the 
conversion extent depends on the modiﬁcation reaction duration 
[295] . 53% and 66% of the –CN groups of PIM-1 were replaced with 
amidoxime groups when it was subjected to the modiﬁcation re- 
actions for 1.5 or 3.0 h, respectively. It is necessary to point out 
here that as the population of amidoxime groups in PIM-1 chain 
increases, the selectivity also increases, whereas permeability de- 
creases.  After  PIM-1  modiﬁcation,  the  formation  of  a  perfect  in- 
terface between the ﬁller and the polymeric matrix guarantees an 
excellent CO 
2 capture by the membrane [295] . It is believed that 
strong hydrogen bonds are formed between amine groups of the 
MOF and amidoxime groups of the polymer. These strong interac-

tions between the ﬁller and the polymer, at 30 wt% of the ﬁller, not

Comparing the diffusivity and solubility data, it can be observed 
that the addition of 30 wt% of the ﬁller increases the diffusivity co- 
eﬃcient 10 times, whereas the solubility coeﬃcient is not affected 
2  permeability of the AO- 
upon the addition of the ﬁller. The CO 
PIM-1/NH 
2 -UiO-66 decreased from 8,425 to 5,800 Barrer after 31 
days (showing just 31% permeability loss) and remained constant 
in the next 80 days [295] . This shows the establishment of strong 
hydrogen interactions between the ﬁller and the polymer, which 
lowers the production of non-selective voids, suppresses the gen- 
eration of the undesired channels, and reduces the aging problems 
as well. To reach the best MMMs performance, it is necessary to 
modify both the ﬁller and the PIM-1 chains simultaneously. 

MFM-300 (V III ) can be distributed homogenously in the PIM- 
1 matrix and has a good aﬃnity towards it. The addition of the 
MOF increases CO 
2  permeation due to chemical aﬃnity between 
2 molecules and one-dimensional pore channels of the MOF. At 
CO 
2  permeability  was  reported 
25  wt%  loading  of  the  MOF,  the  CO

to be 4,617 Barrer and the CO

cated above the 2008 Robeson upper bound. As a result, porous 
MFM-300  (V III )  containing  hydroxyl  groups  seems  to  be  a  good 
MOF for incorporation into PIM-1 to fabricate MMMs for CO

It has been shown that MOFs addition and methanol treatment 
make the MMMs more permeable. In the case of both pure PIM- 
1  and  the  MMMs,  the  permeability  increase  upon  the  methanol 
treatment  is  attributed  to  simultaneous  solvent  extraction  and 
free-volume generation. The ﬁller incorporation improves the dif- 
fusivity coeﬃcient but has little effect on the solubility coeﬃcient.

2 permeability compared to the pure PIM-1 but also keeps the 
CO

This may be ascribed to the ability of NH

the one that improves permeability without sacriﬁcing selectivity

To fabricate membranes for natural gas puriﬁcation, sheet-like 
MOFs  were  added  to  PIM-1  [298] .  Such  an  MOF  is  copper  1,4- 
benzenedicarboxylate  nanosheets,  CuBDC-ns  MOF,  which  is  a  2D 
layered MOF. It can establish a large interface with PIM-1 chains. 
Moreover, it has a pore size of 5.2  ˚A, which is large enough for 
4 molecules. The

note here that ultrathin membranes made via spin coating method 
have improved gas transport properties compared with thick mem- 
branes obtained through conventional solution casting method. In 
addition, shear forces exerted on 2D nanosheets during the spin 
coating process orient the selective pores of the MOF in a direc- 
tion where permeation driving force and gas ﬂux exist. So, it seems 
that incorporating 2D MOF particles and taking the advantage of 
spin coating method are good strategies to develop eﬃcient gas- 
separating membranes.

The addition of ZIF-8 to PIM-1 can improve its CO 

2 permeability 
and the CO 
4 selectivity [268] . The main reason behind the per- 
meability improvement is improved diffusivity coeﬃcient. In com- 
parison to solid impermeable SiO 
2  nanoparticles, ZIFs nanoparti- 
cles are tunable in terms of particle size and functionality. Thus, 
their  addition  to  PIM-1  leads  to  an  MMM  surpassing  the  2008

Robeson upper bounds. PIM-1 has very high CO 
ﬁcient but low CO 
2 diffusivity coeﬃcient. The addition of the ZIF-8 
nanoparticles does not alter the solubility coeﬃcient but improves 
the diffusivity coeﬃcient of PIM-1[268]. This is a feature that ZIF- 
8 nanoparticles have but other nanoparticles like silica do not. The 
CO 
2 permeability increases from 4,390 Barrer for pure as-cast PIM- 
1 to 6,300 Barrer for as-cast PIM-1 matrix containing 43 vol.% ZIF- 
8, though the relationship between ﬁller content and permeabil- 
ity is not monotonous [268] . Moreover, the CO 
4 selectivity in- 
creased from 14.2 to 14.7. The maximum selectivity happens at 28 
vol.%  of  ZIF-8  where  the  selectivity  value  is  18.6.  In  the  case  of 
alcohol-treated PIM-1/ZIF-8 MMMs, a monotonous relationship ex-

ists between CO

4 selectivity of the mem- 
branes decreases monotonously from 17 to 7.3 upon the addition of 
43 vol.% ZIF-8 [268] . Both as-cast and ethanol-treated PIM-1/ZIF-8

through the cavities of the ﬁller [268] .

TOX-PIMs are a family of PIM-1s, which are crosslinked by a 
thermo-oxidative process. Membranes that have such crosslinked 
PIM-1  chains  show  high  CO 
4  selectivity  up  to  70.  However, 
their CO 
2  permeability is low (less than 1,0 0 0 Barrer). The addi- 
tion of nano-porous ﬁllers can compensate for the low permeabil- 
ities. Over two years, the selectivity of such membranes increases, 
while  their  permeabilities  decrease  slightly.  However,  after  two 
years, they showed two orders of magnitude higher gas transport 
properties than the pure PIM-1 [276] . Song et al. [276] added non- 
2 and microporous ZIF-8 nanoparticles to the PIM-1 ma- 
porous SiO 
trices and exposed the system to the thermal oxidation crosslink- 
ing at the presence of oxygen at 350-450 °C. Fig. 28 a schemati- 
cally presents the manufacturing steps of such MMMs. Usually, the 
crosslinking reaction decreases permeability, and this reduction is

2  selectivity  has  been  reported  to 
decrease  signiﬁcantly  in  the  range  of  0–5  wt%  of  the  ZIF-8  and 
remains ∼27 in the ﬁller range of 5-20 wt% [276] . However, the 
4  selectivity slightly decreased from 38 to 27 in the ﬁller

range  of  5-20  wt%  [276] .  The  improvement  in  the  CO

is known, solubility and diffusivity coeﬃcients both contribute to 
the  permeability,  but  solubility  tests,  in  this  case,  show  that  no 
signiﬁcant difference exists between the solubility coeﬃcients of 
PIM-1, TOX-PIM-1, and SiO 
2 /ZIF-8-TOX-PIM-1. Thus, the improved 
CO

which is caused by the generation of extra channels and heteroge- 
neous interfaces upon the addition of the ﬁller.

8.7. Effect of ﬁller geometry on PIM-based MMMs performance for 
CO 2 separation 

Nanoﬁller  geometry  has  a  signiﬁcant  effect  on  the  gas  sep- 
aration  performance  of  MMMs.  In  this  section,  the  permeability 
of graphene/PIM-1 is compared with those of MMMs made from 
PIM-1/fumed  silica  [252]  and  PIM-1/PEG-functionalized  MWCNT 
(f-MWCNT) [264] . All of these three nanoparticles suppress PIM-1 
aging through decreasing conformational freedom and chain pack- 
ing. However, the level of aging suppression depends on the ﬁllers 
loading level. In the case of PIM-1/f-MWCNT, the highest perme- 
ability is achieved with the addition of 1 vol.% of the ﬁller, while 
in the case of the fused silica, the highest permeability is achieved 

at 24 vol.% ﬁller addition. In a direct contrast, just 0.05 vol.% of 
the graphene in PIM-1 leads to the highest permeation. These re- 
sults  imply  that  not  only  the  available  surface  area  of  the  ﬁller 
but  also  the  curvature  of  the  surface  affect  the  permeability  of 
the MMMs. Silica is a spherical nanoparticle, f-MWCNT is a cylin- 
drical one, while graphene is a planar ﬁller. The different loading 
levels of each nanoﬁller at which the maximum permeability hap- 
pens points out to the different accessible surface areas that each 
nanoﬁller provides. While both of silica and f-MWCNT have surface 
areas around 250 m 2 /g, the maximum permeability occurs at 24 
vol.% silica incorporation while for f-MWCNT that value is 1 vol.% 
[264] . For a single graphene sheet, the theoretical surface area is 
about  2,630  m 2 /g,  and  for  a  few  layers  of  graphene,  it  is  lower 
but high enough to endow the highest permeability by just 0.05 
vol.% addition. The MMMs fabricated by planar few-layer graphene 
ﬁllers  retained  its  CO 
2  permeability  after  8  months  [299] .  The 
membrane containing 0.164 vol.% of the graphene showed an ini- 
2 permeability of 7,830 Barrer [299] . This membrane main- 
tial CO 
tained a major portion of its permeability after 8 months; its CO 
2 
permeability decreased to 5,680 Barrer at the end of the period. On 
the other hand, the CO 
2 permeability of the pure PIM-1 decreased 
from 5,120 to 3,670 Barrer in this period [299] . As a result, it can 
be concluded that the ability of ﬁllers for preventing chain packing 
increases  in  the  order  of  spherical,  cylindrical,  and  planar  ﬁllers 
[299] . Table 8 summarizes the effects of different nanoparticles on 
the CO 

2 separation performance of PIM membranes. 

9. Potential of PIM membranes for industrial implementations 

Nonlinear sorption; that is, the dependence of permeability on 
pressure, causes a membrane to show different behaviors in mixed 
gas  and  pure  gas  permeation  tests.  To  evaluate  the  potential  of 
2 separation processes, a prototype PIM- 
PIMs in industrial-scale CO 
1 membrane was studied and was found to show a CO 
4 selec- 
tivity of 8 and a mixed-CO 
2 permeability of 4,500 Barrer, under a 
CO 
2 partial pressure of 10 bar [200] . Up to an operating pressure 
of 77 bar, the modiﬁed glassy AO-PIM-1 membrane demonstrated 
a unique separation performance with a ternary mixture feed con- 
taining CO 
2 S [301] . Similarly, up to an operating pressure of 
48 bar, an OH-functionalized PIM (PIM-6FDA-OH) membrane was 
used successfully for the separation of an aggressive sour natural 
gas containing H

Consequently,  CO 

Ladder  PIM-Trip-TB  is  another  polymer  suitable  for  fabricat- 
ing  membranes  that  are  able  to  separate  CH 
2  mixed 
gases  [303] .  Its  membranes  are  promising  candidates  for  reduc- 
ing greenhouse gas emissions, producing clean energy and propos- 
ing the 2018 mixed-gas CO 
4  upper bound ( Fig. 29 a) [89] . As 
an instance, large scale production of AO-PIM membranes can be 
practiced for fabricating composite structures or integrally skinned 
asymmetric membranes with hollow-ﬁber or ﬂat-sheet geometries. 
2 -selective  ultra-permeable  PIM  membranes 
have received growing attention in recent years for carbon capture 
and bio/natural gas upgrading owing to the intrinsic eﬃciency of 
separations. Future progresses to commercialize these membranes 
should focus on the preparation of AO-PIM-1 as TFC or asymmet- 
ric hollow-ﬁber membranes. Regarding industrial-scale production, 
gas separation membranes with appropriate mechanical properties 
are  required  to  assure  the  feasibility  of  their  fabrication  as  thin 
ﬁlms that are installed in spiral-wound or hollow-ﬁber modules. 
PIM-1  has  suﬃcient  elasticity  to  withstand  the  elastic  deforma- 
tions during gas separation [305] . 

High robust membranes can be fabricated from PIM-PIs. KAUST- 
PI-1 demonstrates higher Young’s modulus and tensile strength at 
break than PIM-1 and PIM-PI-1. However, KAUST-PI-1 cannot sus- 
tain high strains. PIM-PI, PIM-EA-TB, and EA-DMN have satisfactory 
mechanical properties with respect to commercial CA membranes

brane [ 26 , 307 , 308 ]. The thin ﬁlm acts as a selective layer, which 
controls the separation properties and the support provides me- 
chanical strength required for industrial applications [309] . Techno-

Engineering  of  PIM  membranes  for  gas  separations  through 
polymer chemistry is a fast-evolving ﬁeld of research. The avail- 
ability  of  numerous  starting  monomers  provides  a  large  degree 
of  freedom  for  tuning  properties  of  PIMs,  including  the  packing 
structure and membrane properties. However, the use of expensive 
reagents, complex synthesis procedures, and low yields are barri- 
ers hindering the wide-spread use of PIM membranes. For indus- 
trial applications, the low stability (physical aging and plasticiza- 
tion),  and  low  scalability  of  PIMs  are  additional  challenges.  For- 
tunately, these challenges can be tackled by tailoring the molec- 
ular structure, rigidity, microporosity, and chemistry of PIMs dur- 
ing  their  synthesis.  These  abilities  require  the  improvement  of

technical  knowledge  to  a  level  that  permits  systematic  prepara- 
tion of PIMs with desirable chain stiffness, functional groups, inter- 
chain rigidity, and pore size distribution. Some of these properties 
work against each other. Thus, systematic procedures are needed 
to synthesize PIMs with an optimum combination of all properties. 
They  include  procedures  for  introducing  CO 
2 -philic  groups  into 
the polymers structure and incorporating suitable contortion sites, 
adjusting physiochemical properties of PIMs enabling the separa- 
tion of gas components based on their molecular sizes and solu- 
bilities, achieving long-term stability, and incorporating contorted 
moieties into other classes of polymers. In designing new molec- 
ular  structures  or  modifying  already  existing  PIMs,  membrane 
processability should be considered. Any crosslinked structure or 
long branches for improving gas transport properties should not 
limit the processability of PIMs. Several post-processing methods 
such  as  thermal  treatment  and  crosslinking  can  be  used  to  im- 
prove physical aging and plasticization resistance. However, mem- 
branes modiﬁed by these methods are not scalable and suffer from 
brittleness. 

In  terms  of  geometry,  the  trend  is  towards  designing  hollow 
ﬁber  PIM  membranes  rather  than  ﬂat  sheet  counterparts.  Any 
modiﬁcation  that  facilitates  the  processing  of  PIMs  in  the  form 
of  hollow  ﬁber  is  highly  favorable,  as  ﬁber  spinning  of  existing 
PIMs is more diﬃcult than commercial polymers. While integrating 
different moieties with various levels of rigidity into PIMs struc- 
tures  provides  high  degrees  of  intrachain  rigidity,  the  resulting 
PIMs have not been studied adequately. Further improvements can 
be achieved by studying structure −physical property and physical 
property −transport property relationships of PIM membranes, as 
these relationships are still not well understood. New PIM mem- 
branes  with  satisfactory  gas  selectivities  can  be  fabricated  using 
a combination of diffusivity- and solubility-controlled approaches. 
However, balancing the chain mobility and segments aﬃnity are 
still a challenging. 

There  has  been  extensive  research  studies  to  develop  new 
facilitated-transport PIM membranes with improved selectivity and 
aging and plasticization resistance. Although these membranes suf- 
fer from drying and carrier saturation, they are suitable for use at 
room temperatures and low pressures at which other membranes 
demonstrate  low  performances.  Membranes  stability  and  perfor- 
mance can be tailored by surface modiﬁcations especially in asym- 
metric membranes. Solubility-controlled PIM membranes have po- 
2  selectivity  without  adding  extra  process- 
tential  to  enhance  CO 
ing diﬃculties and costs related to membranes fabrication. Contin- 
ued research to achieve long term stability is crucial for developing 
solubility-controlled membranes appropriate for industrial applica- 
tions. 

Many approaches have been proposed to mitigate physical ag- 
ing  and  plasticization,  and  improve  gas  sieving  abilities  of  free- 
standing PIM membranes. Future endeavor in the area of TFC PIM 
membranes include applying these approaches to thin ﬁlms and 
testing  the  ﬁlms  over  a  commercially  useful  period.  Continuous 
studies on TFC membranes will generate data needed to plot CO

alcohol  soaking  technique  which  has  been  used  widely  for  PIM 
membranes may detach the thin ﬁlm from the support.

There is a need for testing PIM membranes under conditions 
that more closely resemble the real practical environments, as gas 
transport properties of PIM membranes have mostly been tested 
under pure gas conditions. In addition, ﬂue and natural gases con- 
tain minor components like CO, H 
2 S, and water, which may affect 
the  membranes `  performance  and  stability.  The  effects  of  these 
components should be taken into consideration in future studies. 
Another less explored area is PIM-based blend membranes. There 
is a need for exploring different polymers, blended with PIMs, to 
investigate their gas transport properties, phase behavior, compat- 
ibility, and mechanical and thermal strengths. 

Of  demand  are  more  accurate  atomistic  molecular  simulation 
techniques that can accurately predict a membrane’s gas separa- 
tion  properties.  These  techniques  facilitate  the  interpretation  of 
experimental data and screening of potential PIMs for membrane 
applications  before  experimentally  fabricating  them.  An  accurate 
molecular simulation technique can estimate the effect of differ- 
ent functionalizations on CO 
2 separation properties of PIM mem- 
branes. Besides, the monomer type, the effect of the backbone’s 
rigidity, and the introduction of bulky side groups on microporos- 
ity  can  be  analyzed  computationally.  Also,  these  techniques  can 
help  establish  structure-property  relationships  and  guide  experi- 
mentalists in their search for optimal designs. However, in simulat- 
ing PIM membranes there are currently challenges such as the oc- 
currence of plasticization and swelling, which change microporous 
polymers’ structure from static to dynamic. Thus, future modeling 
efforts should focus on developing easy-to-run, fast, accurate mod- 
eling techniques that are capable of accounting for these dynamic 
phenomena. Besides, insights can be gained by developing data- 
driven models such as machine learning models trained with the 
vast available experimental data sets. These models and the result- 
ing data analytics can facilitate the discovery of new PIM mem- 
branes. 

Despite appealing features of PIM-based MMMs, restricting the 
movement of polymer chains in the ﬁller’s vicinity may create non- 
selective voids at the ﬁller/polymer interface. Many surface modi- 
ﬁcations have been introduced to overcome these problems. How- 
ever, there is no accurate-enough technique to quantify the extent 
of interactions between particles and PIMs chains in MMMs un- 
der the current knowledge. There is a need for developing quan- 
titative characterization methods to measure the change in such 
interactions. Also, there is a need for further investigating the ef- 
fects  of  the  particle  size  and  shape  on  the  CO 
2  performance  of 
PIM-based MMMs. The use of very thin ﬁlms ( < 1μm) as an active 
layer of membranes is very attractive. So, investigating membranes 
containing 2D nanomaterials can be a hot topic. More investiga- 
tions are needed to develop PIM-based MMMs which simultane- 
ously have ﬁne particle dispersion, no agglomeration, low level of 
unselective voids and chain rigidiﬁcation, easy processability, and 
economic feasibility for large-scale production.

11. Concluding remarks 

Strategies  that  have  been  applied  to  adjust  the  gas  transport 
properties of PIM membranes were reviewed. Incorporating highly 
rigid  moieties  into  the  polymer  backbone  and  interlocking  moi- 
eties  increase  the  backbone  rigidity  and  consequently  improve 
the  gas  transport  properties.  Attaching  extended  substituents  to 
bridged bicyclic moieties creates 2D ribbon-shaped chains, which 
provide  ultra-permeability.  For  example,  the  attachment  of  vari- 
ous substituents to BTrip moiety of PIM membranes endows the 
membranes with gas separation performances that are above the 
newest CO 
2 upper bounds. Such strategies can im- 
prove the permeability of PIM membranes, making them suitable 
for CO 
2 removal from fuel and ﬂue gases. However, most of highly 
permeable PIM membranes show selectivities below 40, which has 
been  recommended  for  CO 
2  separation  [312] .  Incorporating  new 
moieties  and  cleverly  designing  the  PIM  backbone  are  effective 
methods for balancing permeability and selectivity. There is a com- 
mercial need for integrally-skinned asymmetric membranes with 
a very thin selective layer of < 200 nm placed on a large support 
layer. Also, new membrane modules that improve mass transport 
and are suitable for the TFC membranes are needed.

In  the  case  of  polyimides,  it  was  discussed  how  stable,  con- 
torted,  and  kinked  polymer  structures  endow  membranes  with 
energy-eﬃcient gas separation performance and excellent proper- 
ties such as processability, thermal and mechanical stabilities, and 
feasibility.  These  properties  permit  performing  different  kinds  of 
post-modiﬁcation  reactions  and  adjustments.  Better  understand- 
ing  of  structure-property  relationships  will  enable  the  design  of 
the advanced membrane materials that are commercially viable. In 
PIM-PIs, the form of the side chains attached to the dianhydrides 
or diamines inﬂuences membrane gas separation properties. It can 
also affect membrane characteristics, inter-chain molecular inter- 
actions, chain packing, and pore-size distribution, which affect the 
trade-off between permeability and selectivity of the membranes. 
The PIM-PIs membranes prepared from diamines containing a 
4 upper 
rigid moiety are unable to surpass the CO 
bounds.  Incorporating  bridged  bicyclic  moieties  into  dianhydride 
molecules, connecting short and bulky bridgehead substituents to 
the moiety, and limiting the rotation around the imide bond via 
utilizing short diamines bearing branched groups endow PIM-PIs 
with  ultra-microporous  structures  and  consequently  lead  to  the 
fabrication  of  membranes,  performances  of  which  will  be  above 
the 2008 Robeson upper bounds but still below the 2019 upper 
bounds.  The  fabrication  of  eﬃcient  membranes  requires  control- 
ling materials properties at the nano and molecular scales. Thermal 
treatment at optimum temperatures via TR and TC processes, and 
the fabrication of CMS membranes from PIM-PIs are notable strate- 
gies  for  surpassing  the  2008  Robeson  upper  bounds.  Also,  PIM 
membrane post-modiﬁcation methods —such as thermal crosslink- 
ing, controlled thermal-oxidative crosslinking, UV-crosslinking, and 
twisting the porous network toward ultra-microporosity using ap- 
propriate  chemical  functionalization  — allow  for  surpassing  the 
2008 Robeson upper bounds. Embedding functionalized nanomate- 
rials in the PIM matrices endows ﬁxed facilitated transport mem- 
branes  and  MMMs  with  synergetic  properties  that  provide  the 
PIM-based nanocomposite membranes with excellent gas separa- 
tion performance. Most of PIM-based MMMs have been made of 
PIM-1.  However,  other  PIM  polymers  especially  PIM-PIs  can  be 
used to fabricate other types of PIM-based MMMs.

Exposure of PIM membranes to gas steams containing CO 
high pressures can lead to selectivity loss stemming from plasti- 
cization. Making a balance between inter- and intra-chain rigidities 
is necessary to mitigate plasticization. Effective approaches to mit- 
igate physical aging include an appropriate design of the polymer 
backbone architecture, post-modiﬁcation, and nanomaterial addi- 

36 

tion.  The  formation  of  porous  polymers  with  ﬂexible  backbones 
and rigid side chains represents a promising new family of ma- 
terials for addressing physical aging and plasticization. New mate- 
rials are required with excellent stability against aging and plas- 
ticization to minimizing their degradation over harsh thermal and 
chemical conditions. The brittleness of PIM membranes can be ad- 
dressed by blending them with other polymers that have excellent 
ﬂexibility and toughness. The plasticization problem of PIM mem- 
branes can also be addressed by blending. These areas are evolving 
very fast, enabling the fabrication of more robust, higher perfor- 
mance gas-separation membranes.
