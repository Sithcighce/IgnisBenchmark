    "question_text": "Calculate the CO2 permeability in Barrer for a PIM membrane with a thickness of 50 μm, steady-state CO2 flux of 2.5 × 10⁻⁴ cm³(STP)/(cm²·s), and a pressure difference of 2 atm. Assume standard conditions and explain how thickness reduction impacts industrial applicability.",
    "standard_answer": "To calculate CO2 permeability (P_CO2) in Barrer, use the formula: P_i = (N_i * L) / Δp, where N_i is the steady-state gas flux, L is membrane thickness, and Δp is pressure difference. Given: N_CO2 = 2.5 × 10⁻⁴ cm³(STP)/(cm²·s), L = 50 μm = 0.005 cm, Δp = 2 atm. Note that 1 Barrer = 10⁻¹⁰ cm³(STP)·cm/(cm²·s·cmHg), and 1 atm = 76 cmHg, so Δp = 2 * 76 = 152 cmHg. First, compute P_CO2 in base units: P_CO2 = (2.5 × 10⁻⁴ cm³(STP)/(cm²·s) * 0.005 cm) / 152 cmHg = (1.25 × 10⁻⁶ cm³(STP)·cm/(cm²·s)) / 152 cmHg ≈ 8.22 × 10⁻⁹ cm³(STP)·cm/(cm²·s·cmHg). Convert to Barrer: P_CO2 = (8.22 × 10⁻⁹) / (10⁻¹⁰) = 82.2 Barrer. Reducing thickness (L) directly increases permeability, as P ∝ 1/L for a given flux and pressure. Industrially, thinner membranes (e.g., 0.1–1 μm in TFC membranes) enhance permeance (P/L), reducing module size and capital costs. For example, halving thickness doubles permeance, improving efficiency in CO2 capture processes by lowering energy requirements and operational expenses, though it may challenge mechanical integrity and defect formation.",

    "question_text": "How does the geometry of triptycene moieties in PIM membranes influence gas transport properties for CO₂/CH₄ separation, specifically regarding chain rigidity, ultra-microporosity, and molecular sieving ability?",
    "standard_answer": "Triptycene-based PIM membranes exhibit enhanced CO₂/CH₄ separation performance due to their unique geometric structure, which increases chain rigidity and creates ultra-microporosity. The fused-ring and highly-rigid triptycene moiety, combined with restricted rotation of phenazine moieties and conformational barriers in the backbone, provides TPIM-1 and TPIM-2 with intra-chain rigidity higher than PIM-1 and PIM-PIs. This increased rigidity disrupts chain packing more effectively, creating narrower pore size distributions and higher ultra-microporosity. The high surface area and ultra-microporosity of TPIM-1 are attributed to chain packing disruption caused by the triptycene core block and the large sizes of bridgehead substituents. The molecular sieving ability of triptycene-based PIMs is directly ascribed to this combination of chain rigidity and ultra-microporosity, which preferentially allows smaller CO₂ molecules to diffuse while hindering larger CH₄ molecules. This geometric optimization results in TPIM-1 showing CO₂ permeability of 1545 Barrer with enhanced selectivity compared to other PIM structures, demonstrating how moiety geometry directly controls the balance between diffusivity and solubility mechanisms for superior gas separation performance.",

    "question_text": "How do the solution-diffusion and convective-diffusion mechanisms contribute to gas transport in PIM membranes, and how does pressure affect gas uptake according to the provided paper?",
    "standard_answer": "In PIM membranes, gas transport occurs through both solution-diffusion and convective-diffusion mechanisms. The solution-diffusion mechanism, which is the primary mechanism in commercial polymer membranes, involves three sequential steps: gas dissolution into the polymer matrix, diffusion through the membrane driven by concentration gradients, and desorption on the permeate side. This mechanism generates a chemical potential gradient across the membrane. However, PIM membranes exhibit exceptionally high gas permeability that cannot be explained by solution-diffusion alone. The paper states: 'This high level of gas permeability shows that, in addition to the solution-diffusion mechanism, the convective-diffusion mechanism contributes to gas transport in PIM membranes.' The convective-diffusion mechanism becomes significant due to the high microporosity and interconnected pore structure of PIMs. Pressure significantly affects gas uptake mechanisms in PIM membranes. According to the paper: 'At low pressures, the gas uptake of PIM membranes is through ultra-micropores. However, at high pressures, the gas uptake is through micropores.' This pressure-dependent uptake behavior influences both transport mechanisms, with ultra-micropores dominating at low pressures and larger micropores becoming more significant at higher pressures. The exceptional permeability of PIM membranes, reaching up to 52,800 Barrer as cited in the paper, results from the synergistic contribution of both mechanisms operating through the microporous structure.",

    "standard_answer": "The incorporation of contorted rigid moieties like spirobisindane (SBI) in Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity (PIMs) enhances CO₂ permeability primarily by increasing free volume through chain packing disruption. The contorted geometry prevents dense polymer chain alignment, creating high specific surface areas and fractional free volumes that facilitate gas transport. According to the paper, 'Polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) with high free volumes have been synthesized by incorporating contorted rigid moieties into polymers backbones.' This free volume manipulation creates pathways for gas molecules to diffuse through the membrane. The paper further states that 'The high surface area of PIM-1 (>700 m²/g) allows for high gas uptakes and provides extremely high gas permeability.' Regarding transport mechanisms, the paper explicitly notes that 'This high level of gas permeability shows that, in addition to the solution-diffusion mechanism, the convective-diffusion mechanism contributes to gas transport in PIM membranes.' The convective-diffusion mechanism becomes significant due to the interconnected pore structure and high microporosity of PIMs, allowing for enhanced gas flow beyond traditional solution-diffusion processes. However, the paper notes that despite their appealing properties, 'membranes made of these polymers have not been used industrially because of their fast physical aging,' indicating that while free volume manipulation and convective-diffusion enhance permeability, aging effects remain a challenge for practical applications.",
