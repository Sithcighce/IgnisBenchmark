    "question_text": "Using stagnant film theory, derive the complete relationship between burning rate and Spalding's B-number for convection-dominated pool fires. Start from the conservation equations for energy and species across the boundary layer, integrate them across the stagnant film, and show all mathematical steps leading to the final expression. Explain the physical significance of each term in the B-number expression, clarify the meaning of all variables, and discuss how this formulation applies to pool fire dynamics and its limitations.",
    "standard_answer": "The derivation begins with the conservation equations for energy and species across the boundary layer above the fuel surface. For a convection-dominated pool fire where radiation is negligible, we consider a stagnant film of thickness δ. The energy conservation equation is: ρuC_p(dT/dy) = λ(d²T/dy²), and the species conservation equation for fuel vapor is: ρu(dY_f/dy) = ρD_d(d²Y_f/dy²). Integrating these equations across the boundary layer from y=0 (fuel surface) to y=δ (free stream) and applying boundary conditions: at y=0, T=T_l, Y_f=Y_f,s; at y=δ, T=T_∞, Y_f=Y_f,∞. The integration yields: m''C_p(T-T_l) = λ(dT/dy) and m''(Y_f-Y_f,s) = ρD_d(dY_f/dy). Defining a conserved variable b = (C_p(T-T_l) + ΔH_c(Y_o2,∞/r - Y_o2))/L_v, which remains constant across the boundary layer. At y=0, b = B = (ΔH_c·Y_o2,∞/r + C_p(T_l-T_∞))/L_v. At y=δ, b=0. Integrating db/dy across the film gives: m'' = (λ/(C_pδ))ln(1+B) = (ρD_d/δ)ln(1+B). Using the analogy between heat and mass transfer with unity Lewis number (Le=1), where λ/(ρC_p) = D_d, this becomes m'' = (μ/δ)ln(1+B). The Spalding B-number is defined as B = (ΔH_c·Y_o2,∞/r + C_p(T_l-T_∞))/L_v. Here, ΔH_c is the heat of combustion per unit mass of fuel, Y_o2,∞ is the ambient oxygen mass fraction, r is the stoichiometric oxygen-to-fuel mass ratio, C_p(T_l-T_∞) represents the sensible heating required to raise the fuel from ambient temperature T_∞ to its evaporation temperature T_l, and L_v is the latent heat of vaporization. The logarithmic term ln(1+B) arises from integrating the coupled conservation equations, accounting for the exponential decay of temperature and species concentrations across the boundary layer. Physically, higher B-numbers indicate fuels that require less energy for vaporization relative to the combustion energy released, leading to faster burning rates. This formulation is particularly applicable to non-luminous flames where convective heat transfer dominates over radiation effects, such as in small to medium-scale pool fires with low soot production. However, it has limitations when radiation becomes significant, as in large-scale pool fires or highly sooty flames, where the modified B-number accounting for radiation effects must be used.",
