Carbon nanotube-based materials are gaining considerable attention as novel materials for renewable energy conver-
sion and storage. The novel optoelectronic properties of CNTs (e.g., exceptionally high surface area, thermal conductiv-
ity, electron mobility, and mechanical strength) can be advantageous for applications toward energy conversion and
storage. Although many nanomaterials are well known for the unique structure-property relations, such relations
have been sought most intensively from CNTs due to their extreme diversity and richness in structures. For the devel-
opment of energy-related devices (like photovoltaic cells, supercapacitors, and lithium ion batteries), it is critical to
conduct pre-evaluation of their design, operation, and performance in terms of cost, life time, performance, and envi-
ronmental impact. This critical review was organized to address the recent developments in the use of CNT-based
materials as working/counter electrodes and electrolytes in photovoltaic devices and as building blocks in next-gener-
ation flexible energy storage devices. The most promising research in the applications of CNTs toward energy conver-
sion and storage is highlighted based on both computational and experimental studies along with the challenges for
developing breakthrough products.

1. Introduction

2. Carbon nanotubes: concepts and properties

PThe exponentially increasing demand for renewable energy,
accompanied by the rise of high-speed, portable, wearable, and
transparent electronic devices, has sped up the development of new
techniques not only to catch up such unprecedented challenges but
also to produce new device architectures. A promising solution for
such challenges lies in nanotechnology of which advent can help
stimulate the invention and fabrication of many advanced materials
with innovative performance. The material structure can be tunable
by nanotechnology which endowed nanomaterials with highly
unique and novel properties and new opportunities in various fields
of applications (e.g., energy conversion and storage, water treat-
ment, contaminant sensing, and molecular biology).

PNanomaterials have been widely investigated as electrodes and
electrolytes in energy conversion and storage applications due to
their many advantageous properties. In particular, carbon-based
nanomaterials (e.g., 2D graphene sheets, 1D carbon nanotubes, and
0D fullerenes) have drawn particular attention due to their proper-
ties, which are derived from their atomic structure and surface
chemistry. Among the wide variety of nanomaterials, carbon nano-
tubes (CNTs) possess one of the unique nanostructures due to their
fine chemical composition and atomic-bonding configuration. Addi-
tionally, CNTs possess strong structure-property relations based on
highly diverse structures [1]. The electro-mechanical properties of
CNTs have been investigated intensively since their finding in early
1990s. Although early research centered on their growth and charac-
terization, the focus shifted toward diverse commercial fields
ranging from photovoltaic (PV) to sensing applications (e.g., by inte-
grating them into thin-film electronics) [2(cid:1)8]. As we will demon-
strate in this review, there have been growing interests in using
CNTs in a range of applications.

PBecause of their many fascinating properties (e.g., good mechani-
cal strength and elasticity, high electronic sensitivity to mechanical
strain and chemical absorbates, good electronic properties ranging
from semiconductor to metals, and very large surface area-to-vol-
ume ratio), the use of CNTs has been recommended for diverse appli-
cations such as components of PV devices, energy storage devices,
chemical sensors, actuators, and metrology-probe tips [9(cid:1)12]. In
this review, we focused on the role of CNT-based materials in energy
conversion and storage. Existing studies directed to both theoretical
and computational aspects of CNTs are all discussed. We also
detailed the challenges associated with their practical application
toward commercialization.

PCNTs with their unique morphologies and novel physicochemical
properties, represent promising materials for future applications.
They are one-dimensional allotropes of carbon where hexagonally-
oriented carbon atoms have a cylindrical nanostructure. Carbon-
based nanomaterials are classified depending on their atomic bond-
ing (sp, sp2, and sp3 hybridizations) and dimensionality [13]. Glob-
ally, the commercial interest in CNTs has been reflected in their
production capacity which is estimated to exceed several thousand
tons per year while growing continuously [14]. The CNT mass pro-
duction is a multi-level process that includes molecules, material,
reactor, process, and system level engineering, as shown in Fig. 1
[15]. The molecular level engineering is based on the formation of
CNTs via chemical route. It concerns on the tunable structure of
CNTs, e.g., crystallinity, wall number, defect, length, and chirality
with the help of such variables as proper growth windows, use of
proper catalysts, and carbon sources. The production cost of CNTs
can be estimated easily with the help of selected chemical route and
operating window. The material-level engineering emphasizes the
strong interactions among CNTs that can lead to several types of
agglomerates including aligned CNTs, entangled CNTs, and sparse
CNTs. It requires a better knowledge of CNTs with respect to their
structure, position, alignment, and quality control. Further, the
third-level engineering is related to the domain of CNTs production
with consideration of their hydrodynamics, apparent/intrinsic kinet-
ics, heat/mass transfer kinetics, and catalyst deactivation. The forth-
level process engineering relies on the construction of facilities
required for continuous and mass production of CNTs, e.g., purifica-
tion, automation, packaging, and delivery. There are several factors
that can help in improving the efficiency of the system such as: (i)
molecular scale intensification, (ii) saving of feedstock, and (iii)
multi-functionality of the reactor. The last level of the CNT mass pro-
duction is related to environmental as well as ecological considera-
tions about their production and commercial applications. It should
thus consider the effect of CNTs exposure on human health and bio-
sphere.

PFurther, several synthesis strategies for CNTs have been devel-
oped, e.g., arc discharge [16], chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [17],
laser ablation [18], electrolysis [19], pyrolysis [20], flame synthesis
[21], electron or ion beam irradiation [22], and solar approaches
[23]. The laser ablation and arc discharge of graphite are common
techniques for production of CNTs from carbon vapor. These CNTs
can maintain good quality with a fewer structural defects due to the

Ppresence of impurities. Moreover, in both techniques, the growth
process takes place at high temperatures, ensuring proper annealing
of the defects in tubular structured graphene sheets [24,25]. How-
ever, in these techniques, it is difficult to control growth on pat-
terned substrates at reasonable rates. Also, these techniques are
costly due to their high operating temperatures.

PTo overcome these challenges, CVD techniques have been pro-
posed and used extensively to allow for the growth of various CNT
structures [26,27]. CVD is an attractive process due to its lower oper-
ating temperature range (»500(cid:1)1200 °C). Moreover, because CVD
allows for better control over the diameter, length, and wall number
of CNTs, their applications can be extended to the fields of nanoelec-
tronics, field emission, and many more [28]. It is possible to achieve
the desired properties in CNTs by varying the composition and struc-
ture of the catalysts; for instance, the size of the catalyst particles
has a great impact on the outer diameter of CNTs [29].

PNevertheless, researchers are still focusing on developing more
efficient, cost-effective, and green alternatives for the production of
CNTs on a large scale. Recycling of waste or discarded materials into
high-value products (like ceramics and steels) has also motivated
researchers to synthesize CNTs from waste resources for diverse
applications [30,31]. Utilizing waste products as resources for the
synthesis of CNTs is an encouraging step towards reducing solid
wastes and fabrication costs simultaneously.

PTable 1 summarizes the synthesis of CNTs from waste materials
[32(cid:1)35]. Afre et al. produced CNTs through an easy method using
spray pyrolysis with turpentine oil as the source and nitrogen as the
carrier gas (temperatures of 500(cid:1)900 °C with an interval of 10 min)
[32]. The prepared CNTs exhibited an inner diameter of 2.5 nm and a
maximum yield of 33 wt% at 700 °C. A catalytic combustion method
for multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs) was proposed based on in situ
synthesis using polypropylene as a source of carbon and a supported

Pnickel catalyst in the presence of an organic-modified clay (OMC)
[21]. MWCNTs with the highest yield of 41.16 wt% can be obtained
by the addition of 10 wt% OMC. Mis-Fern(cid:1)andez et al. synthesized
CNTs via the residual solid decomposition from waste tires in a
quartz tube (under 1.33 Pa) at a temperature of 900 °C for »15 min
[33]. Morales et al. successfully synthesized an MWCNT-hercynite
nanomaterial using a one-step CVD process with FeAl2O4 as a cata-
lyst under an H2/N2 atmosphere [34]. The mean diameter of the pro-
duced CNTs increased as the particle size of the catalyst increased.
Bajad et al. developed a facile method for CNT production from poly-
propylene waste with a maximum yield (514 wt%) of CNTs
(2(cid:1)25 nm diameter) using Ni4Mo0.2MgO1 catalyst [35]. It is highly
beneficial to appropriately utilize waste as the resource for CNTs
production. However, suitable post-treatments are often required to
avoid the liberation of intermediate gaseous products that are toxic
in nature (e.g., gases acquired during synthesis) [36].

PBoth CNT morphologies (including single-walled and multi-
walled nanotubes) exhibit significant electrical transport features
that affect their suitability and performance in advanced electronics
[37(cid:1)39]. The different properties of CNTs, determined computation-
ally and experimentally, are summarized in Table 2. CNTs and gra-
phene are the strongest known materials due to the high strength of
covalent bonds (C H C) between adjacent sp2 carbon atoms. CNTs
exhibit exceptional tensile strength (e.g., 150 GPa); this value is
»20 times higher than steel while being lighter by five times
[42,43]. Indeed, numerous efforts, both theoretical and experimen-
tal, have been made to account for the electromechanical properties
of CNTs [48,49]. Computational modeling for the characterization
and design of CNTs is crucial to pursue their development in terms
of their structural, thermal, mechanical, and electronic properties
[56,57]. As it has become possible to shrink the sizes of devices and
systems to the nanoscale, there is greater demand to increase the

Pcomputing power of quantum mechanics-based computational tech-
nologies. Based on this, several novel concepts as well as designs
have been proposed via modeling and software-assisted simulations
realization or verification through experiments)
(before their
[58,59]. In particular, CNTs with very high length-to-diameter ratios
(»132,000,000:1) have been constructed [60]. There are different
factors (e.g., the number of walls, length, diameter, type of defects,
concentration, and synthesis method) that exert a significant impact
on the properties of CNTs. The highly symmetric structure and
extremely small size support the remarkable quantum effect and
electromagnetic/lattice properties of CNTs.

PThe classification of CNTs depends on variables such as the
length, arrangement of hexagonal rings, and diameter. The different
forms of CNTs can be grouped as (1) either metallic or semiconduct-
ing; (2) armchair, zigzag, or chiral; and (3) single-walled (SWCNTs)
or MWCNTs, with scroll-like or seamless cylinder structures, as
shown in Fig. 2 [61]. The arrangement of carbon atoms and general
defect level strongly affect the mechanical strength of CNTs [62].

PToday's computational capabilities, including computer simula-
tions, can efficiently replace previous development methods for new
materials based on trial and error and have become an integral part
of material design. There are different computational approaches for
modeling the behavior of CNTs. These can be categorized as follows:
(i) atomistic modeling [63], (ii) continuum modeling [64], and (iii)
nano-scale continuum modeling [65]. By employing an appropriate
modeling technique (as shown in Fig. 3), it is possible to generate
each wall of imaginary CNTs with the help of a graphene sheet that
has been rolled into a seamless tube with a constant radius. These
modeling techniques are very effective in predicting the position of
atoms depending on the interactive forces and boundary conditions.
PThe computational modeling of CNT nanomechanics and func-
tionally-graded composite materials for diverse applications (such
as sensors, actuators, electronic devices, and molecular machines)
are basically well-known within the highly accurate quantum
regime [66].
In general, carbon-based nanomaterials are more
appropriate as molecular level building blocks for the design of a
nanoscale system.

3. CNTs for renewable energy conversion

PTo date, global energy analysts have anxiously looked forward to
the development of renewable and green energy sources. The recent
in materials science, particularly advancements
advancement
related to CNTs, has allowed for the development of a wider range
renewable and green energy technologies (such as solar cells and
fuel cells). Solar cell technologies, which pursue methods to convert
solar energy into electric energy, are safe, eco-friendly, and inexpen-
sive. Over the past two decades, considerable improvements have
been achieved in solar cells, ranging from silicon-based crystalline
solar cells to organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs), in terms of enhanced
lifetimes and reduced costs. Nonetheless, the power conversion effi-
ciency (PCE) of solar cells still needs to be improved. Unlike conven-
tional energy materials (e.g., silicon), CNTs exhibit some interesting
size/surface-dependent optoelectronic and morphological proper-
ties (e.g., high electrical conductivity, excellent electrocatalytic
activity, high electron mobility, good optical transparency, low cost,
and high abundance); note that these properties are crucial compo-
nents for enhancing the energy conversion and storage performance
[67]. Thus, CNTs are promising candidates for use in next-generation
solar cells. As such, they have been extensively explored in every
layer of solar cells to ensure better charge conduction and improved
electrode flexibility [68].

3.1. CNTs as transparent conducting films

PTransparent conducting films (TCFs) are electrically conductive
and optically transparent to visible light. In various forms of modern
optoelectronic devices, including thin-film PV cells, touch screens,
organic light emitting devices (OLEDs), and liquid crystal displays
(LCDs), TCFs are employed as significant components. As such, they
have acquired a great deal of marketability. Because of the rapidly
growing demand for TCFs, numerous efforts have been made to
boost the properties of existing TCFs. However, attempts to add
more flexibility to TCFs have not been possible in the case of

Ptraditional TCFs (e.g., indium-doped tin oxide [ITO] and fluorine-
doped tin oxide [FTO]).

PCurrently, ITO is the most commonly used TCF due to its excellent
optoelectronic properties with a low sheet resistance (i.e., 10(cid:1)20
V/sq) and a high optical transmittance (i.e., 90%) [69]. Nonetheless,
both FTO and ITO are expensive (involving complex manufacturing),
brittle, and not solution processable, which limits the flexible appli-
cations of PV cells. Also, FTO-based devices suffer from leakage due
to their structural defects [70]. The deficiencies of present TCFs have
forced researchers to develop alternate electrode materials that are
competent enough in terms of their transmittance, sheet resistance,
and cost.

PA TCF material should be selected carefully to balance the optical
transmittance and electrical conductivity. Reducing the resistivity of
the TCF leads to an increase in the carrier concentration or mobility,
which can increase light adsorption. However, both low- and high-
resistivity materials play an important role in PV cells [71]. A high-
resistivity TCF is essential to prevent shunts of the junction, which
can cause losses in the voltage and fill factor. As such, many recent
researchers have focused on carbon nanostructures as an alternative
to existing TCFs. Because CNT films offer high flexibility and high
transmittance in the UV to mid-IR spectral region, they have been
considered as promising replacements for conventional FTO/ITO
electrodes [72]. CNTs are well-known for numerous advantages
including excellent optoelectronic properties, abundance of raw
material, chemical stability, inherent strength, and flexibility relative
to inorganic TCFs. The desired properties of CNTs-based TCFs can
thus be acquired via existing commercially scalable techniques
through the consideration of their synthesis techniques, purity, and

Pgeometry effect. CNT films with thicknesses from 1 to 100 nm
offered high electrical conductivity along with good optical proper-
ties at a lower processing cost while serving as more stretchable and
flexible platforms with stronger mechanical strength. Table 3 shows
the features of different TCFs in PV cells [73]. The factors governing
the performance of CNT-based TCFs are the sheet resistance and visi-
ble light transmittance, as derived from the DC conductivity (sDC)
and optical conductivity (sOP) of the CNT film [74]. A higher value of
sDC is desirable to obtain both high sheet conductance and high opti-
cal transmittance; this can be achieved either by increasing the car-
rier density through doping or by increasing the mobility.

PEnormous research efforts involving CNTs have been made to
accurately compute the different parameters including the sheet
resistance, transmittance, conductivity, and adsorption co-efficient
[75(cid:1)77]. These computed results indicate that the transmittance
drops exponentially when the thickness of the CNT-based TCF
increased, whereas the sheet resistance is inversely proportional to
this change. At the experimental level, it becomes important to over-
come this tradeoff because the conductivity of CNT-based TCFs
needs to be improved further. Over the past few decades, many
investigations have been made in attempts to produce high-quality
CNT films based on dry and wet processes including CVD, laser abla-
tion, spraying, spin coating, filtration transfer (FT), and Langmuir-
Blodgett (LB) deposition (Fig. 4) [78(cid:1)82]. Dry-processed CNT films
are found to possess higher quality with better CNT(cid:1)CNT contact
and fewer defects. Kaskela et al. reported a low sheet resistance (i.e.,
110 V/sq) with 90% transmittance for dry-processed CNT-based
TCFs [83]. Alternatively, wet-processed CNT-based TCFs are compet-
itive for industrial use due to their low-temperature handling, which

derived from a number of variables including the quality of the car-
bon source, morphology of the CNT film, quality of CNT dispersion,
and doping treatment. In Table 4, the performance of different TCFs
is compared with that of an ideal material. To increase the carrier
concentration and reduce the contact resistance (CNT(cid:1)CNT) in CNT
networks, typical strategies adopt such approaches as chemical

Paffect the optical and electronic properties of the CNT-based thin
films including (i) the intrinsic electrical resistance and the resis-
tance associated with junctions between CNTs, (ii) graphitization,
(iii) Schottky barriers between metallic and semiconducting CNTs,
(iv) CNT surface interactions, (v) film purity, and (vi) tube-specific
optical properties. Improved conductivity was observed in redox-
doped semiconducting SWCNTs (s-SWCNTs) as compared to intrin-
sic or redox-doped metallic SWCNTs (m-SWCNTs). Unfortunately,
high-quality CNT-based TCFs exhibited higher sheet resistances of
»150(cid:1)300 V/sq (with an optical transmittance of »85% over
400(cid:1)1800 nm) [96], which were higher than those of ITO-based
TCFs (10(cid:1)20 V/sq with 90% transmittance) [97]. In redox-doped m-
SWCNT films, the resistivity decreased by a factor of four, while the
carrier density increased by only 1%. As a result applying an acid
treatment
to the SWCNTs, a considerable improvement was
observed in the performance of SWCNT-based TCFs; these showed
71% transmittance at 550 nm and a very low sheet resistance (i.e.,
59 V/sq) [98]. Hecht et al. deposited CNTs on polyethylene tere-
phthalate (PET) substrates from a chlorosulfonic superacid (CSA)
solution using a filtration/transfer technique [99]. These CNT films
offered a low sheet resistance (i.e., 60 V/sq) with a high transmit-
tance of 90.9% at 550 nm, which corresponded to a high DC conduc-
tivity of 12,825 S/cm and a large DC-to-optical conductivity ratio
(sDC/sOP) of 64.1. Doping with acids (either nitric acid or SOCl2)
undoubtedly decreased the sheet resistance but had an adverse
effect on the stability. Zhou et al. reported vacuum filtration and
PDMS-based transfer printing of CNT films on various substrates,
including glass, PET, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), and silicon
[100].

PThe introduction of a capping technique using poly(3,4-ethylene-
dioxythiophene):poly-
(PEDOT:PSS) on acid-
(styrenesulfonate)
treated CNT films provided long-term air and thermal stability while
also producing high conductivity along with a sheet resistance of
105 V/sq and a transmittance of 80% at 550 nm [101]. Hellstrom
et al. reported that molybdenum oxide (MoOx) nanoparticles could
be used as a stable dopant; these led to excellent thermal stability at
300 °C with a 100 V/sq sheet resistance and 85% optical transmit-
tance in CNT-based TCFs [102]. MoOx can be simply deposited over
CNT films via different routes involving the use of either thermal
evaporation technique or solution-based precursors. The sheet resis-
tance was further reduced to 85 V/sq with 83% transmittance via the
application of a PEDOT: PSS adlayer; this led to a high conductivity
ratio of 23. The MoOx-doped CNTs are non-toxic, extremely stable,
and inexpensive alternatives to acid-treated CNTs for practical TCFs.
PAs a means to resolve these stability issues, polymer-nanotube
composite films were introduced [103]. Through PEDOT passivation
and SOCl2 doping, a performance improvement is observed in arc-
discharge nanotube films, demonstrating a sheet resistance of
approximately 160 V/sq and 87% transparency over HiPCO nano-
tubes with a large sheet resistance of 7200 V/sq. Here, the PEDOT
passivation offered superior surface smoothness while SOCl2 doping
helped decrease the sheet resistance. De et al. prepared arc discharge
CNT-filled PEDOT:PSS composites to produce flexible, transparent,
and highly-conductive thin TCFs [104]. The CNT-filled PEDOT:PSS
composite-based TCFs exhibited an optical transmittance of 75%, a
low sheet resistance of 80 V/sq, an extreme stability under flexing
and cycling ( < 1% resistance changes over 130 bend-cycles), and a
conductivity ratio of 15. Moreover, the performance of polyaniline/
carbon nanotube nanocomposites, when assessed in various
respects, was proven to exhibit excellent mechanical stability,
80(cid:1)90% transmittance at 550 nm, 300 V/sq sheet resistance, and
good reproducibility after 100 bend cycles [105].

PBeyond CNTs, graphene has also been reported as attractive TCFs
due to its fascinating properties in terms of good optical transpar-
ency with high electrical conductivity [106]. Bae et al. fabricated 30-
inch graphene films over copper substrates via CVD method [107].

PThe film offered a sheet resistance of 125 V/sq with a very high opti-
cal transmittance of 97.4% and half-integer quantum effect to ensure
high quality TCFs. To replace the existing ITO and FTO films, gra-
phene/CNT hybrid TCFs can be an appropriate solution that offered a
high conductivity ratio of 10.03 [109]. In graphene/SWCNT hybrid
films, the transmittance decreased slightly with increasing graphene
content. In contrast, the sheet resistance and DC conductivity were
altered non-monotonically as a function of the film composition. An
optimum composition with 3 wt% graphene results in a peak in the
DC conductivity (»40% increase in the conductivity ratio compared
to CNT-based TCFs) and a high transmittance of 80% along with a
sheet resistance of 100 V/sq [110]. CNT-halide hybrid films were
reported to have the best sDC/sOP value of 40 with sheet resistances
of 55(cid:1)65 V/sq and 90(cid:1)110 V/sq with 85% and 90% transmittance,
respectively [111]. In addition, these films were highly stable; no
degradation occurred upon exposure to ambient air over 1000 h or
upon heating at 400 °C over 24 h. As such, these CNT-halide hybrid
films are considered potential candidates for future TCFs with
extreme stability. Kim et al. further improved hole extraction from
the polymer by mixing SWCNTs and graphene oxide (GO) at a mass
ratio of 1:0.2; this led to a reduction in the vertical resistance [112].
Fig. 5 shows the spectra of different TCFs including ITO, PEDOT:PSS,
Ag grid, graphene, and random networks of SWCNTs [113].

PIn Fig. 5, it is clear that graphene sheet- and SWCNT-based TCFs
demonstrate flatter and wider transmittance spectra in comparison
to the other TCFs (i.e., the Ag grid, PEDOT, and ITO); these properties
of TCFs are highly desirable for various applications (e.g., OPV cells
and display devices) [114]. The best reported PCE of CNT TCFs in OPV
cells (glass/SWCNT/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/Ca/Al) was 4.13% with a
fill factor of 0.53 [115]. However, after applying an MoOx layer, a PCE
of 6.04% was achieved with a glass/MoOx/SWCNT/MoOx/PEDOT:
PSS/PTB7: PC71BM/LiF/Al device structure; this device had a short-
circuit current density of 13.7 mA/cm2 [116]. In terms of the overall
performance, CNT-based TCFs are still superior to other comparable
materials (e.g., ITO/FTO glass). Further improvement can be achieved
with the help of different dopants that can facilitate the modification
of the work function of CNTs; e.g., hybridization of CNTs with
AgNWs can fulfil the requirements of the anode for an OLED display
[117]. Further research efforts are needed in order to continue
improving these materials, such as studies investigating optimal
structures, CNT purity, diameter, surface functionalization, stable
doping, chirality control, and metal composites.

3.2. Challenges with CNT-based TCFs

PTCFs with high transmittance ( > 95%) and low resistivity have
been investigated broadly and intensively for diverse applications
such as electrode materials for OLEDs, LCDs, PV devices, transparent
displays, and touch sensors for touch panels. It is noted that, despite
the low-cost efficiency of existing TCFs, CNT-based TCFs have the
significant potential for use in stretchable, flexible, and wearable
electronics. Today, the overall TCFs market is »$3.5 billion, but this
is estimated to grow to $5 billion by the year 2019 [118]. By the year
2018, the share of CNT-based TCFs is estimated to grow to $1.4 bil-
lion, representing a quarter of the entire transparent electrodes mar-
ket. Feng et al. developed a straightforward technique to transfer
vertically-aligned double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs) on a
200 mm Si wafer directly onto a substrate [119]. As such, they were
able to make it much easier to manufacture touch panels. CNT-based
transparent conductive inks are currently available commercially, as
summarized in Table 5 [120,121]. These inks can be formulated on a
wide variety of substrates involving PET and polycarbonate. Thus,
these CNT-based transparent films can be customized to a broad
range of transparency and sheet resistance levels.

3.3. CNTs in dye-sensitized solar cells

PSince their discovery by Gr€atzel, DSSCs have drawn special atten-
tion from both academia and industry due to their simple and
environmentally-friendly fabrication process, low production cost,
and high efficiency at low light intensity [122]. Conventional DSSCs
are mainly composed of a dye-absorbed working electrode film on a
transparent conducting oxide (TCO), an electrolyte, and a counter
electrode on the TCO [123,124]. Theoretically, the PCE limit for sin-
gle-junction DSSCs is 32% (under standard test conditions), whereas
two-level tandem cells can reach 46% under the same conditions
[125]. Snaith et al. estimated the maximum PCE of DSSCs by decreas-
ing the potential loss to 0.4 eV with an optimal bandgap of 1.31 eV

P(at 940 nm) [126]. This reduction made the cell more efficient with a
PCE of 20.25%, a short-circuit current density of 30.8 mA/cm2, and an
open-circuit voltage of 0.92 V. The reported PCE of DSSCs is approxi-
mately 15% under one sun illumination when using metal-free
organic dyes, such as ADEKA-1 and LEG4; this efficiency approaches
the PCE of traditional Si-based PV cells [127].

PDespite these successes, much effort is still required to improve
the transport of electrons in the DSSC structure. The grain bound-
aries in the structure can cause an increase in the probability of elec-
tron recombination with an oxidized sensitizer [128]. The recent
progress achieved in the field of CNT nanocomposites and nano-
structures should be able to improve the pathways of photogener-
ated electrons while also supporting charge injection and extraction
[129,130]. As CNTs also offer excellent electrochemical catalytic
activity for electrolyte reduction, such function of CNTs makes them
more promising for DSSCs applications. In DSSCs, the major difficulty
with CNTs is the presence of several impurities including amorphous
carbon and catalyst metals (usually Co, Ni, and Fe oxides). Thus, CNTs
must be pre-treated if employed for such application. Several techni-
ques have already been reported for the treatment of CNTs such as
air oxidation treatment [131] and mixed acid treatment [132]. The
latter is suggested to be more effective than the former in terms
of CNT purification as well as the formation of oxygen-containing
groups, mainly carboxylic group on the surface [133]. The presence
of carboxylic groups can help in exfoliation of CNT bundles, thereby
facilitating their homogeneous dispersion. Further, increase in dis-
persibility of CNTs can be achieved with the help of some disper-
sants (e.g., POEM). However, these dispersants must be removed
after thin film fabrication as nonconductive dispersants can lower
the device efficiency [134]. Huang et al. reported the role of POEM as
dispersant in Pt/MWCNT counter electrode fabrication [135]. The
decomposition of POEM was observed in a temperature range of
110(cid:1)390 °C to lead to the enhancement of PCE in DSSCs from 1.28%
(at 110 °C) to 8.47% (at 390 °C). CNTs have been widely incorporated
into different layers of DSSCs, such as in the working electrodes with

P[151], mesoporous structures [152], and 3D hierarchical architec-
tures [153]. For most nanoparticles, these structures can provide a
significant improvement in the performance (e.g., excellent charge
transfer properties in 1D nanostructures or better light scattering
properties in 3D mesoporous nanospheres) by virtue of their large
surface area [154,155]. Usually, a 3D network of randomly-dispersed
spherical TiO2 nanoparticles is used as the working electrode [156].
However, if the disordered network contains multiple grain bound-
aries, this can reduce the electron mobility (e.g., slow transport) or
cause charge carrier recombination losses [157]. The overall perfor-
mance and efficiency of PV devices have been affected considerably
by these factors [158]. Such inherent problems associated with con-
ventional working electrodes drove researchers to develop highly-
effective functional materials with better conductivities and to
improve the separation and diffusion of photogenerated charge car-
riers [159].

such as (i) working electrode, (ii) electrolyte, and (iii) counter electrode.

Pa mixture of TiO2, in the solid state electrolyte, and in the counter
electrode, as shown in Fig. 6. In DSSCs, CNTs introduced into semi-
conducting layers can be used as charge transport channels to sup-
port a fast charge carrier transport pathway along with high
conductivity at reduced costs. The enhancement in PV performance
of DSSCs can be optimized at a low concentration range ( < 0.5%) of
CNTs in the semiconducting layers [136].

P3.3.1. Working electrodes

PThe working electrode serves as the support to absorb the dye
molecules. It also transports the photogenerated electrons from the
sensitizer to the external circuit. Thus, the working electrode
requires a large surface area as well as fast charge transfer rate. The
large surface area ensures the adsorption of a large amount of dye,
while a fast charge transfer rate is essential to ensure a high electron
collection efficiency to prevent these charges from undergoing
recombination [137]. Generally, a working electrode is composed of
a layer consisting of a wide bandgap nanostructured semiconductor
film such as TiO2 [138], ZnO [139], SnO2 [140], SrTiO3 [141], or NbO5
[142] deposited on the transparent conducting electrodes (TCEs). For
working electrodes, numerous film preparation techniques are avail-
able, including sol(cid:1)gel [143], spray pyrolysis [144], electrochemical
anodization [145], hydrothermal/solvothermal [146], electrospin-
ning [147], and atomic layer deposition [148]. These approaches
have been applied to obtain a diverse assortment of different nano-
structures including nanorods [149], nanosheets [150], nanotubes

improvement

PThe incorporation of CNTs into the working electrode is one of
the most effective ways to improve the PCE of DSSCs because of the
resultant
transport properties
[160(cid:1)162]. However, increasing the CNT concentration may lead to
reduced transparency, affecting the light adsorption at the sensitizer
layer; this can decrease the photocurrent and PCE of the PV cells, as
shown in Table 6 [163(cid:1)174]. Yen et al. introduced MWCNT/TiO2
nanocomposite working electrodes, obtained via a modified sol(cid:1)gel
procedure using acid catalysis, into DSSCs [163]. They observed tre-
mendous improvements in the electrode roughness factor, from 834
to 1267, along with reduced charge recombination and enhanced
adsorption of the dyes. The function of CNTs in mesoporous electro-
des is to act as specific channels that facilitate the electron transport
to the TCO film, preventing to encounter multiple grain boundaries;
this process can also help reduce the resistance of the electrode, as
shown in Fig. 7 [164,165]. With CNT charge transport channels,
noticeable increments of 44% and 18.7% were observed in the short-
circuit current density (JSC) and overall PCE, respectively.

PCNTs have been introduced as conducting scaffolds in TiO2 films
to improve the separation as well as transport kinetics of photogen-
erated charge carriers to the collecting electrode surface [166]. A sig-
nificant improvement (by a factor of two) in the incident photon-to-
charge conversion efficiency (IPCE) was observed in DSSCs. Without
doubt, the incorporation of CNTs into working electrode increases
the short-circuit current density. However, because it also increases
the Fermi level of the modified working electrode, it can cause a
decrease in the open-circuit voltage (VOC) [167]. Dembele et al. pre-
sented an easy, fast, and low-cost processing method for hybrid
MWCNT-TiO2 films in order to enhance the functional properties of
DSSCs [168]. The hybrid film led to a 25% improvement in the PCE
relative to conventional TiO2 films. The integration of MWCNTs
(0.010 wt%) into the TiO2 film helped enhance the electron lifetime
and reduced charge recombination losses. The high-quality interface
of the MWCNT-TiO2 working electrode can increase the extent of

Pshown to facilitate the transport and collection of charge carriers,
further efforts are still needed to make more efficient cells (e.g.,
seeking ways to overcome the reduced transparency).

P3.3.2. Electrolyte

thermal

PThe electrolyte is one of the most crucial components in DSSCs; it
plays the significant role of providing ionic conductivity in the bulk
solution while providing an appropriate potential barrier for energy
conversion. The oxidized redox couple in the electrolyte is reduced
at the counter electrode while also supporting dye regeneration
through a charge transfer reaction with the dye molecule during the
photoelectric conversion process [176]. Thus, the electrolyte has
great influence on the IPCE and long-term stability of the cell. The
crucial parameters of an electrolyte include (i) the ionic mobility
and solubility of a redox couple in an organic medium, (ii) the driv-
ing force for dye regeneration, and (iii) the fast electron transfer
kinetics. The selection of an effective electrolyte is determined by its
electrical conductivity,
stability, and vapor pressure
[177,178]. There are different types of electrolytes that have a signif-
icant impact on both the efficiency as well as the stability of DSSCs;
these include (i) liquid electrolytes [179], (ii) quasi-solid electrolytes
[180], and (iii) solid-state electrolytes [181]. The electrolyte must
ensure fast diffusion of the charge carriers, good interfacial contact
with the mesoporous working electrode and the counter electrode,
and avoid desorption/degradation of the dyes. Liquid electrolytes
(such as I¡/I3
¡) are the most preferred option in DSSCs because of
their large diffusion coefficient, high conductivity, low vapor pres-
sure, and high flowability [182]. However, because of several draw-
backs of the I¡/I3
¡ redox couple (e.g., relatively low thermal
stability, leakage, and sealant corrosion), many research efforts have
been made to develop new electrolytes with enhanced performance
[183]. Quasi-solid state electrolytes (or ionic liquid electrolytes)
have attracted research interest because of their high ionic conduc-
tivity, better thermal stability, broad electrochemical potential win-
dow, and negligible vapor pressure [184(cid:1)186]. However, the PCE of
DSSCs based on quasi-solid state electrolytes are still lower than
cells based on liquid electrolytes; this is mainly due to their low-
speed ion diffusion [187,188].

PRecent research efforts have emphasized the improvement of ion
diffusion for the incorporation of CNTs into ionic liquid electrolytes,
as shown in Table 7 [189(cid:1)196]. The CNTs in ionic liquid electrolytes
serve as both the charge transporter and catalyst for the reduction of
¡. Ahmad et al. examined the PCEs of DSSCs incorporated with gra-
I3
phene, SWCNTs, and a graphene/SWCNT hybrid in a 1-methyl-3-
propylimidazolium iodide (PMII) ionic electrolyte [189]. Accord-
ingly, the PCEs of these DSSCs were enhanced to 2.10%, 1.43%, and
2.50% (relative to 0.16% for pure PMII), and showed high stability
upto 300 °C. The presence of the ionic liquid within the graphene/
SWCNT hybrid helped build structured networks for efficient trans-
fer of electrons. The acid-oxidized MWCNT-based ionic electrolyte
yielded the best PCE (5.74%) in DSSCs due to its enhanced miscibility
with the ionic liquid compared to that of pristine MWCNTs [190].

Pdye adsorption due to the large surface area and coexistence of dual
pores. Also, the hierarchical porous structure of oxide electrodes can
help improve the addition of CNTs; thus, adding a significant amount
of CNTs should be advantageous for the charge injection, series resis-
tance, and electron lifetime [169]. However, high loadings of
MWCNTs were observed to cause decreases in the conductivity of
electrodes. For instance, the PCE is reduced from 10.29% to 5.67%
when MWCNTs were loaded at 0.025 wt% and 0.03 wt%, respec-
tively; these reduction was ascribable to the agglomeration of nano-
tubes and the resultant reduction in the optical transparency [170].
Mehmood et al. presented a quantum modeling technique to effec-
tively investigate the different thermodynamic aspects of the charge
transport phenomenon in DSSCs [171]. The transparency loss of the
oxide layer was minimized when CNTs were loaded at the optimum
level (0.025 wt%). However, charge collection at the photoanode was
significantly increased. The diameter of CNTs also impacts device
performance. CNTs with a large diameter (60 nm) exhibited a higher
PCE (3.85%), while those with a small diameter (10 nm) had a lower
PCE (1.56%) [172].

PThe adsorption spectra of MWCNTs-TiO2 films became broader
and more intense after co-sensitization with N719 and N3 dyes
[173]. For the MWCNT/TiO2 mesoporous network, the best PCE of
DSSCs is 7.27%; these devices had a high short-circuit current density
of 16.86 mA/cm2, which is attributed to the enhanced light adsorp-
tion and improved electron transport through the TiO2 mesoporous
thin films [174]. Satapathi et al. investigated the dependence of the
device performance on the size of graphene sheets; smaller gra-
phene sheets facilitated the adsorption of dye,
leading to an
increased PCE of 6.62% [175]. Incorporating CNTs into the working
electrode is a highly effective means to increase the device flexibility
and performance. However, although CNT-TiO2 hybrid films were

Poxide, a high ionic conductivity was observed with a PCE of 6.70% in
DSSCs [191]. CNTs have also been incorporated with solid-state elec-
trolytes to realize high ionic conductivity, improved roughness, and
amorphicity [192,193]. Using a CNT-polyacrylonitrile (PAN) compos-
ite electrolyte in DSSCs led to a relatively high PCE of 3.9% and a
short-circuit current density of 10.9 mA/cm2 [194].

PIn various electrochemical applications, ionic liquids can be used
as stable electrolytes that enhance the conductivity or reduce the
viscosity [195,196]. It was found that adding 0.10 wt% carboxylic
group-functionalized MWCNTs (oMWCNTs) to ionic liquids, such as
1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (PMImI), was helpful
in
reducing the viscosity from 1380 to 400 cP [197]. This approach was
also useful in improving the PCE of DSSCs without affecting their
thermal stability. Wang et al. used a hybrid MWCNT/poly(oxyethy-
lene)-segmented oligo(amide-imide)
(POEM) gel electrolyte in
DSSCs and achieved the best PCE of 6.86% with a high short-circuit
current density of 15.3 mA/cm2 [198]. Undoubtedly, CNTs are good
additives for quasi-solid and solid-state electrolytes and hold great
promise to enhance the PCE of DSSCs via enhancing the conductiv-
ity.

P3.3.3. Counter electrodes

PThe main responsibility of counter electrodes is to transport the
photogenerated electrons derived from photoanode to the electro-
lyte. Traditionally, a thin platinum layer, deposited on ITO glass, has
been employed as the counter electrode; this has resulted in remark-
able electrocatalytic activity [199]. The best PCE of about 12.30%
with a fill factor of 0.74 was acquired by the FTO/TiO2/Y123/YD2-o-
C8/Co2+/Co3+/Pt device structure [200]. However, platinum suffers
from several limitations including its high cost, limited supply, and
instability when it is used in various chemical and electrochemical
applications [201]. CNTs as counter electrodes have been studied
extensively as a promising alternative to conventional platinum
counter electrodes. CNTs are appealing for many reasons, including
their low fabrication cost, high electric conductivity, good thermal
stability, large active surface area, high catalytic activity, and good

Pcorrosion resistance [202(cid:1)204]. CNT fibers with various diameters
(25(cid:1)100 mm) have been employed in DSSCs. CNTs with a diameter
of 60 mm were seen to exhibit the best catalytic behavior with a
high PCE of 7.33% [205]. Random networks of interconnected CNTs
are common and preferably used as very thin and transparent
counter electrodes due to their high sheet resistance (of about
50 V/cm2). Higher charge transfer resistance in counter electrodes is
desirable to achieve a better PCE [206].

PThe performance of CNT-based counter electrodes in DSSCs is
summarized in Table 8; this table includes CNTs and their hybrids
(involving metals, conductive polymers, transition metal com-
pounds, and graphene) [207(cid:1)231]. As one good example, MWCNTs
were applied successfully as electrocatalysts for triiodide reduction
in DSSCs to yield a high PCE of 7.96% with a fill factor of 0.64 under 1
sun illumination (100 mW/cm2, air mass 1.5 G) [207]. Furthermore,
counter electrodes with MWCNT webs (20 layers) showed enhanced
performance with a PCE of 4.12%, surpassing the efficiency of CoS-
and Pt-based counter electrodes [208]. Stainless steel foil coated
with SWCNTs also showed good performance as a counter electrode
with a PCE of 3.92%, a high short-current density of 9.21 mA/cm2,
and a good open-circuit voltage of 0.66 V [209]. Vertically-aligned
SWCNT (VASWCNT) counter electrodes are one of the most promis-
ing candidates for improving the performance of iodine-free redox
couple-based DSSCs. These materials offer a good PCE of 5.25% with
a fill factor of 0.68; this quality performance is due to their superior
electrocatalytic activity and low charge-transfer resistance through
the electrolyte/counter electrode interface [210].

PNovel DSSCs with counter electrodes based on vertically-aligned
nitrogen-doped CNT arrays (N(cid:1)(cid:1)CNTs) showed a high PCE (7.04%)
and a fill factor of about 0.67 [211]. These N(cid:1)(cid:1)CNTs were capable of
offering low-cost, platinum-free, and flexible counter electrodes for
DSSCs. Graphene nanoplatelets have also exhibited promising elec-
¡reduction in optically-semitranspar-
trocatalytic activity towards I3
ent thin films with a good PCE of 5.73% and a fill factor of 0.65 in
DSSCs [212]. Li et al. used porous carbon counter electrodes through
coating a binder-free and organic slurry of carbon onto FTO glass at

Plow temperatures; a high PCE of 6.1% was acquired when this
counter electrode was utilized in DSSCs [213]. DWCNTs had the
¡ reduction. Their superior chemical
highest catalytic activity for I3
stability facilitated the charge-transfer kinetics at the electrolyte/
counter electrode interface to yield a high PCE of 8% [214].

PThe potent role of CNT composites (either metallic or polymers)
as counter electrodes for DSSCs has been demonstrated [215]. Xing
et al. assessed N(cid:1)(cid:1)CNTs decorated with Co and Ni nanoparticles as
counter electrodes; accordingly, they reported the best PCEs of
7.75% and 8.39%, respectively [216]. These N(cid:1)(cid:1)CNT-Co and -Ni com-
posites exhibited improved electrocatalytic activities relative to
platinum-based counter electrodes. Nickel oxide nanofilament/
MWCNT (NiO(cid:1)(cid:1)NF/MWCNT) hybrid films with a suitable porous
structure facilitated charge transfer; due to the excellent electroca-
talytic functionality of the film, the charge resistance can be reduced
by increasing the effectiveness in the NiO(cid:1)(cid:1)NF/MWCNTs composite
[217]. The NiS/MWCNT/Ti hybrid film was found to be a superior
counter electrode in DSSCs with an enhanced PCE of 7.90%, compara-
ble to that of Pt/Ti hybrid counter electrodes (6.36%) [218]. Nanohy-
brids of CNT-supported platinum nanoparticles were observed to be
both highly-active catalysts as well as low-cost transparent counter
electrodes. Chen et al. utilized CNT/Pt hybrid counter electrodes that
were 100 nm thick and had an optical transparency of »70% at
550 nm [219]. The CNT/Pt hybrid counter electrode using ITO-coated
polyethylene terephthalate as a substrate yielded a high PCE of
about 8.43% with a fill factor of about 0.64.

PA composite of platinum nanoparticles and MWCNTs, made via a
sulfur-assisted strategy, was used as a counter electrode in DSSCs
[220]. This led to a PCE of 7.69%, which is comparable to platinum-
based counter electrodes (e.g., 6.31%). For reduced-graphene oxide
(RGO)/TaON hybrid films, much higher electrocatalytic activity was
3+ species, leading to a
reported during the reduction of Co(bpy)3
considerable improvement in the PV performance (PCE of 7.65%)
[221]. Transition metal compounds (TMCs) exhibited excellent elec-
trocatalytic properties that were similar to platinum [222]. Tai et al.
reported CNT/TMC hybrids as a counter electrode catalyst in DSSCs
[223]. The MWCNT/MoS2 counter electrodes offered a low charge-
transfer resistance of 1.69 V/cm2 and great electrochemical stability
with a PCE of 6.45%.

PThe idea of using polymers for counter electrodes in DSSCs has
been explored extensively to replace platinum; polymers are appeal-
ing due to their excellent conductivity, electrocatalytic activity, high
stability, and easy fabrication [224]. Aligned CNT-oriented PEDOT:
PSS composites showed extremely high catalytic activity with a high
PCE of 8.3% when they were utilized at counter electrodes in DSSCs
[225]. The reduced efficiency of CNT-based DSSCs is generally
explained by the aggregation of CNTs to form networks with multi-
ple boundaries within the device structure. To resolve this problem,
novel structures have been designed to take advantage of the effec-
tive interactions among CNTs at the molecular scale [226]. Because
of the strong p(cid:1)p interactions between CNTs and nanoribbons
[227], reduced graphene oxide nanoribbon (RGONR)-bridged CNTs
were tested as counter electrodes; these showed a PCE of 8.23%,
which is comparable to the efficiency obtained with a conventional
platinum counter electrode (7.61%) [228]. Using highly-intercon-
nected and ordered mesoporous carbon-CNT medusa-shaped nano-
composites as counter electrodes also produced an excellent cell
efficiency of 8.4% and remarkable stability in a long-term efficiency
test [229]. Arbab et al. reported several benefits of textile fabric elec-
trodes (e.g., light weight, low cost, and flexibility) and fabricated
these with an activated charcoal-doped MWCNT hybrid [230]. This
type of counter electrode showed a very low charge-transfer resis-
tance (i.e., 1.38 V) with high electrocatalytic activity and the best
PCE of 7.29% when used in DSSCs with a polymeric electrolyte; it
was found to outperform platinized FTO counter electrodes [226].
Such CNT-based textile fabric counter electrodes appear to be

Ppromising for next-generation, textile, structured DSSCs. The growth
of CNTs over a bimetallic Fe-V-SBA-15 (1:1 catalyst), when utilized
as counter electrodes in DSSCs, achieved a high PCE of 9.26%, a fill
factor of 0.77, an open-circuit voltage of 0.78 V, and a high short-cir-
cuit current density of 15.88 mA/cm2; these parametric values are
comparable to those of DSSCs with a platinum counter electrode
[231]. Thus, it is essential to develop new organic/inorganic com-
pounds as alternatives to traditional platinum counter electrodes in
DSSCs to make devices more flexible and cost-effective for commer-
cialization.

3.4. Challenges with CNT-based DSSCs

PDSSCs are well-known for several attractive features such as their
simple roll-printing fabrication, flexible nature, good temperature
stability, stable output power in all light conditions, lack of toxic
emissions during manufacturing, and use of low-cost materials.
Because DSSCs are at the start of their development cycle, their ini-
tial products are currently limited to indoor and portable applica-
tions such as chargers, solar bags with wireless solar keyboards, bus
shelters, steel roofing, and semi-transparent windows. The DSSCs
market is anticipated to witness significant growth to over $130 mil-
lion by 2023 [232].

PSeveral companies have already commercialized DSSCs (or have
such plans), including Dyesol, 3GSolar Photovoltaics, Solaronix SA,
SolarPrint, G24i Power, the Sony Corporation, GCell, the Sharp Cor-
poration, Peccell Technologies, Oxford Photovoltaics, the Solaris
Nanoscience Corporation, and many more. Out of the many DSSC
products available on the market, some examples are the GCell sam-
ple DSSC module (1/2 W module, 200 mm £ 150 mm), Gratzel solar
backpack 2 (capacity 5000 mAh), solar keyboard for iOS and Android
( < 6 mm thick) produced by GCell [233], PICTO 1010DEMO pro-
duced by Solarnix (demonstration dye solar cells) [234], G24i thin
film module (200 mm £ 186 mm £ 1.2 mm, 10(cid:1)55 °C) [235], Sony's
lantern-like interior lamp (powered by DSSCs) [236] etc. The future
outlook of DSSCs is highly promising due to their inexpensive
manufacturing processes, large degree of mechanical robustness,
flexible nature, and acceptable efficiency levels (»13%); their appli-
cations are diverse enough to cover home rooftops, window glass
panes, home intelligent sensors, etc. [237,238]. Increasing consumer
awareness regarding the harmful effects of conventional energy
sources provides the basis for the growth of the DSSC market. How-
ever, CNT-based DSSCs have yet to be commercialized. The main
issues that limit existing DSSC technologies are their lifetime and
efficiency. DSSC technologies need to be improved to achieve faster
commercialization. CNTs, which exhibit exceptional chemical stabil-
ity, have improved the future outlook of fabricating DSSCs with
excellent environmental stability.

4. CNTs for energy storage

PThe development of eco-friendly, highly-efficient, and low-cost
energy storage systems has been recognized as one of the most cru-
cial challenges for large-scale usage of energy from renewable
green resources like solar and/or wind power. Recent advance-
ments in portable electric and electronic devices have driven
research efforts to develop new portable energy storage devices
which exhibit both high energy density and high power density. A
typical electrochemical storage device involves (a) electrosorption
of ions, (b) interfacial redox reactions at the electrode/electrolyte
interface, and (c) intercalation of ions into the anode or cathode
[239]. Energy is usually stored at the electrodes/electrolyte inter-
face in the form of electric charge, which are accumulated at the
electrodes (anode and cathode) surface as ions of opposite polarity
and then positioned on the electrolyte side of both electrodes. The
electrochemical reactions that occur at the electrode/electrolyte

Pinterfaces greatly affect the performance of energy storage devices,
i.e., supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) [240]. Thus,
CNTs are expected to contribute to the development of electro-
chemical energy storage systems because they offer effective routes
for electron transfer and ion diffusion through the incorporation of
other active nanomaterials.

PMany researchers pursued the development of different types of
CNT-based electrode materials as well as their combination with
several electrolytes in light of numerous merits they have [241,242].
These properties of CNTs can significantly contribute to the enhance-
ment of their performance, safety, and lifetime (as energy storage
devices). Nevertheless, the existence of catalyst residues and func-
tional groups can induce pseudocapacitance due to involvement of
both Faradiac and non-Faradiac processes; hence, such conditions
can lead to the reduction of their performance as supercapacitors
and LIBs [243]. The catalyst residues can be removed through ther-
mal oxidation method followed by acid treatment [244]. Unfortu-
nately, this technique is yet found to be not that effective for
complete removal of catalyst from CNTs while causing the formation
of amorphous carbon. Another alternative, heating technique is sig-
nificantly effective to remove the amorphous carbon and improve
the graphitization of CNTs [245]. However, there are considerable
uncertainities about the electrocatalytic activity of pristine CNTs.
Kruusenberg et al. reported poor electrocatalytic activities of the
acid-treated SWCNTs and MWCNTs for O2 reduction than as-
received CNTs, mainly due to the loss of metal catalysts on CNTs sur-
face [246]. On the other side, Byers et al. reported that electrocata-
lytic activity of pristine CNTs is highly comparable to Au
electrocatalysts [247]. The enhanced activity of pristine CNTs can be
seen at strained sites modified via oxidation. The electrocatalytic
activity of catalyst residue-free CNTs is strongly reliant on their
number of walls and/or inner tubes; more pronounced electrocata-
lytic activity has been reported on CNTs with 2(cid:1)3 walls [248]. Carter
et al. also reported excellent performance of pristine SWCNT foams
for supercapacitors (specific capacitance: 83 F/g) and LIBs (specific
capacity: 2210 mAh/g) [249].

4.1. Electrochemical supercapacitors

PElectrochemical capacitors, which are widely known as superca-
pacitors, are one of the highly efficient energy storage devices. They
are found in diverse fields of applications such as consumer elec-
tronics (e.g., mobile phones, camera, and toys), medical appliances,
transportation, electrical utilities, and defense systems. There are
various coupling options (among supercapacitors, fuel cells, and bat-
teries) to ensure the delivery of high power to recover energy. There
are two different types of supercapacitors according to their princi-
ples of energy storage: (a) electrical double layer capacitors (EDLCs),

Pinvolving the accumulation of electrostatic charge at the electrode
(s)/electrolyte interface, and (b) pseudo-capacitors, involving charge
transfer via reversible redox reaction(s) to redox materials on the
surface of the electrode [250]. Practically, both storage mechanisms
often work simultaneously. A schematic of an electrochemical
supercapacitor is shown in Fig. 8(a).

PIn comparison to other energy storage systems, supercapacitors
offer rapid charging, higher power density (10 kW/kg), excellent
reversibility (90(cid:1)95%), longer cycle life ( > 1 £ 105), higher coulom-
bic efficiencies, lack of maintenance, and operational safety [251].
Many forms of carbon nanomaterials with large surface areas, fast
electric transport, and open porosity (including CNTs, active carbon,
mesoporous carbon, carbon fiber, and graphene) have been used as
supercapacitor electrodes [252(cid:1)256]. In comparison to traditional
carbon materials, CNTs are much more efficient at percolating active
particles by forming a porous network to facilitate the diffusion of
ions to the surface of the active moiety; they also act to alleviate vol-
umetric changes throughout the charge and discharge [257]. The
synergistic effect between CNTs and pseudo-capacitive nanomateri-
als has yielded high-performance supercapacitors in terms of better
energy as well as power densities. The most popular CNT-based elec-
trodes of supercapacitors are suggested as: (i) bare CNT [258], (ii)
CNT/polymer composite [259], and (iii) CNT/MeOx hybrid electrodes
[260], as shown in Fig. 8(b).

P4.1.1. Bare CNT electrodes

PBoth SWCNTs and MWCNTs have been widely investigated as
effective supercapacitor electrodes with high surface areas to sup-
port aqueous and non-aqueous electrolytes. With the consideration
of bare CNT electrodes, the capacitances typically vary from 5 to
200 F/g with specific areas in range of 120(cid:1)500 m2/g [261]. SWCNT
electrodes have demonstrated a capacitance of 180 F/g along with a
power density of 20 kW/kg and an energy density of 7 Wh/kg
(Table 9) [262]. There are many routes that can be used to success-
fully modify the CNTs to fabricate highly-efficient electrode materi-
als. These can be categorized into two main groups: (i) the covalent
attachment of diverse chemical groups and (ii) the different func-
tional molecules wrapped noncovalently [263,264]. For example,
nitric acid-treated MWCNT electrodes have been used in acidic elec-
trolytes to provide an improved specific capacitance of 102 F/g, a
high surface area of 430 m2/g, and a high energy density (i.e.,
0.5 Wh/kg) [265]. Niu et al. reported free-standing SWCNTs as both
the anode and cathode with a specific capacitance of 35 F/g at a small
equivalent series resistance of 200 mV/cm2 (power density:
197.3 kW/kg and energy density: 43.7 Wh/kg) [266].

PTheoretically, CNTs support an ultra-high surface area; however,
in practice, the net capacitance offered by CNT-based electrodes is
much smaller than the predicted values based on the surface area

P[267,268]. This is mainly caused by the presence of the small quan-
tum capacitance in series. However, it is possible to overcome the
quantum capacitance limitations and improve the energy and power
densities by using appropriate dopants (e.g., N-CNTs) [269]. Further-
more, a very large surface area ( > 2200 m2/g) has been achieved by
creating porosity in CNTs through oxidation [270]. As described
above, enormous efforts have been carried out to enhance the per-
formance of CNTs. However, it is still difficult for pure CNTs to sup-
port the requirement of high energy density without sacrificing the
power density; this is mainly due to the fact that their storage mech-
anism relies on a physical process. The most effective way to modify
CNTs involves the role of pseudocapacitive active materials, i.e., con-
ductive polymers and MeOx, in combination with CNTs [271,272].

P4.1.2. CNT/polymer composite electrodes

PElectronically-conducting polymers have drawn particular atten-
tion as a promising supercapacitor material. They have high specific
capacitance, mainly due to the participation of their entire mass in
the charge process, and also exhibit high conductivity in their
charged state, which can reduce the equivalent specific resistance
and increase the power density [273]. The main limitation of poly-
mers as supercapacitors is their structural instability, which mainly
appears (due to breaking, cracking, volumetric swelling, and shrink-
age) after subsequent charge/discharge cycles due to ion doping and
de-doping.

PRecently, composites of CNTs and conducting polymers (such as
polyaniline [PAni] and polypyrrole [PPy]) have drawn considerable
attention as tools to improve the cycling (charge/discharge) stability
of supercapacitor electrodes [274(cid:1)276]. In these composites, adapt-
ing to the volume changes that occur during charging is easy for the
entangled mesoporous network of CNTs, resulting in much more sta-
ble capacitance (typically in a range from 500 to 3400 F/g). Bai et al.
investigated the use of a PEDOT/MWCNT composite as an electrode
with an energy density of 11.3 Wh/kg; this energy density is larger
than the value provided by the original MWCNT-based electrode
(2.7 Wh/kg) [277]. In the other case of polypyrrole/MWCNT compos-
ite, a high specific capacitance of 165 F/g with high stability has
been obtained with the appropriate selection of a neutral electrolyte
over acidic and alkaline media [278]. Such composite materials also

Poffered design flexibility through their in situ electrochemical poly-
merization [279]. Chen et al. fabricated flexible CNT-based compos-
ite electrodes through electrodeposition of PPy on free-standing
vacuum-filtered CNT films, as shown in Fig. 9 [280]. These electrodes
showed excellent flexibility, good electrochemical performance (vol-
umetric capacitance of »4.9 F/cm3), and long lifetime with excellent
capacitance retention (95% after 10,000 cycles). Liu et al. reported
prodigious capacitance retentions of »85% and »95% after 10,000
cycles with the use of carbonaceous shell-coated PPy and PAni elec-
trodes, respectively [281].

PThe composite of CNTs (20(cid:1)30%) and PEDOT (70(cid:1)80%), prepared
by an electrochemical method, yielded an improved capacitance of
160 F/g, as shown in Table 10 [282(cid:1)288]. Such composites had good
cycling performance, high volumetric energy (due to the large den-
sity of PEDOT), and high stability in all electrolytes. Graphene/PAni
composite electrodes were also shown to exhibit a large electro-
chemical capacitance of 210 F/g and greatly improved electrochemi-
cal stability (i.e., a capacitance retention of »74% after 800 cycles)
[283].

PThe change in performance of any composite with respect to its
constituent materials is mainly ascribed to the several parameters
including electrolyte accessibility, conductivity, and diffusion dis-
tance in the redox-composite electrode structure. An et al. reported
SWCNT/PPy (1:1) composite electrodes with a conducting agent of
15 wt%; they exhibited a very high specific capacitance of 265 F/g
[284]. The role of the conducting agent in SWCNT/PPy composites is
to reduce the internal resistance of the supercapacitor. A MWCNT/
PAni composite offered much higher capacitance (328 F/g) due to
the availability of large number of active sites for Faradaic reactions
[285]. Fu et al. reported that CNT-embedded PPy nanowires had the
ability to retain the 85% of their initial capacitance after 1000 cycles
at a current density of 1 A/g [286]. Zhou et al. observed a greatly
enhanced capacitance of 485 F/g and long cyclic stability for the
PAni/SWCNT composite [287]. The presence of SWCNTs in the
growth process was observed to stimulate the aniline polymeriza-
tion rate, resulting in a porous and highly uniform composite struc-
ture with a lower defect density. By decorating silver nanoparticles
onto the PAni/MWCNT composite electrode, Dhibar et al. were able
to enhance the specific capacitance upto 528 F/g with high

Pconductivity (4.24 S/cm) at room temperature; these electrodes also
showed a high power density of 4185 W/kg and energy density of
187.73 Wh/kg [288].

PUnfortunately, conductive polymeric electrodes suffer from rapid
capacitance decay rate due to structural breakdown that directly
affects the cycling stability of the supercapacitor [289]. Recently,
many efforts have been devoted to develop stretchable supercapaci-
tors using elastic thin-film electrodes. In stretchable devices, it
becomes relatively complicated to maintain a high degree of stretch-
ability and good energy storage efficiency in terms of stable and high
values of specific capacitance. Zhang et al. fabricated a superelastic
fiber-shaped supercapacitor (SFS) based on CNT/PAni composite
electrodes; these electrodes, which were stretchable to over 400%,
offered a high specific capacitance of 79.4 F/g after stretching at a
strain of 300% for 5000 cycles [290].

P4.1.3. CNT/metal oxide composite electrodes

PMeOx have been widely explored as electrodes in pseudocapaci-
tors due to their higher energy densities (compared to carbon mate-
rials) and higher electrochemical stability (compared to conducting
polymers). They support both techniques of energy storage (i.e.,
electrochemical double layers and Faradaic reactions). The primary
requirement for an effective electrode material is that the MeOx
should be electronically conductive with two or more oxidation
states that can coexist. Free intercalation of metal protons into or
out of the oxide lattice during reduction or oxidation supports better
storage activity. The most widely explored MeOx for electrochemical
capacitor electrodes include MnO2 [291], RuO2 [292], Co3O4 [293]
V2O5 [294] Ni(OH)2 [295], Fe2O3 [296] SnO2 [297] and TiO2 [298]. To
lower the deleterious effect of the charge-discharge process on the
cycling stability of MeOx, CNTs are introduced into the electrodes
with MeOx. This type of combination helps restrict the volume
change and also improves inner connections within the hybrid.
When a CNT/MeOx hybrid was incorporated into an active phase-
coated nanotubular backbone,
it showed good pseudocapacitive
properties [299].

PThe entanglement of CNTs was reported to produce an open mes-
oporous network that supports easy ions diffusion to the active sur-
face of the hybrid; this also improves the power density by reducing
the equivalent series resistance. Among the variety of MeOx, MnO2 is
one of the most common supercapacitor electrode materials because
of its high abundance, low cost, easy processing, environmentally-
friendly nature, wide potential range, and high theoretical capaci-
tance (in the range of 1100(cid:1)1300 F/g) [300]. Table 11 compares the

Table 11
Performance of different CNT/MeOx composite-based supercapacitors.

Pperformance of supercapacitors with different CNT/metal oxide
composite-based electrodes. Ramezani et al. showed a specific
capacitance of 180 F/g for a binary MnO2/CNT composite at a high
scan rate of 20 mV/s with a good rate capability [301]. Reddy et al.
reported Au-doped MnO2/CNT hybrid coaxial arrays with a capaci-
tance of 68 F/g, energy density of 4.5 Wh/kg, maximum power den-
sity of 33 kW/kg, and reasonable cycling stability upto 1000 cycles
[302]. The Au doping was seen to improve the contact in between
the electrode material and the current collector, avoiding an ohmic
drop in the charge/discharge curve of the electrode. Further, the best
specific capacitance of 367 F/g have been reported for a ternary
MnO2/graphene nanosheet (GNS)/CNT composite electrode with an
excellent rate capabilities (83% capacitance retention after 3000
cycles).

PAmade et al. fabricated a MnO2/MWCNT composite electrode
with a high specific capacitance of 642 F/g at a high scan rate of
10 mV/s, which corresponds to about 60% of the theoretical capaci-
tance of MnO2 (»1100 F/g) [303]. To increase the cyclic stability, a
core(cid:1)shell CNT/MnO2 electrode was fabricated on Ni foam; this
resulted in a very high specific capacitance of 325.5 F/g as well as an
excellent cycling stability with a 90.5% capacitance retention after
testing for 5000 cycles. This enhanced performance was attributed
to the synergic effects between the Ni foam and the CNTs [304].
Zhang et al. reported a flexible 3D Ni(OH)2/CNF hybrid membrane
with a very high specific capacitance of 2523 F/g (at a scan rate of
5 mV/s), high mechanical flexibility, and superior electrical conduc-
tivity [305].

P4.1.4. CNTs for organic and ionic electrolytes

PIn supercapacitors, electrolytes are one of the most dominant
components which can be categorized into aqueous, organic, ionic
liquid, and solid-state electrolytes. The choice of electrolytes has a
great impact on cell voltage of supercapacitors which can be sup-
pressed through electrolyte decomposition at high potentials. To
ensure the high cell voltage, the voltage window for electrolyte sta-
bility should be improved (usually aqueous electrolytes (1.0(cid:1)1.3 V),
organic electrolytes (2.5(cid:1)2.7 V), and ionic electrolytes (3.5(cid:1)4.0 V))
[306,307]. Diverse types of organic electrolytes have been reported
with wide operating voltage windows and less toxicities [308]. The
incorporation of carbonaceous materials into organic electrolytes is
not found to produce any pronounced effect (or negligibly small).
This is mainly due to the nature of functionalities of carbon surface
in pseudocapacitive potential for organic electrolytes; e.g., anthra-
quinone-modified carbon needs proton participation to ensure its

Ppseudocapacitive contribution, not in favor of aprotic organic elec-
trolytes that ultimately contributes to the lowering of the specific
capacitance [309]. The presence of pores in carbonaceous materials
can limit the accessibility of organic ions, thereby putting a negative
effect on specific capacitance of the supercapacitors [310].

PIt should be noted that at a certain range of operating tempera-
ture of supercapacitors (e.g., ¡30 °C to + 60 °C), ionic electrolytes suf-
fer from low ionic conductivity and high viscosity [311]. However,
several choices of anion and cation combinations have been reported
to overcome such limitation so that one can acquire high ionic con-
ductivity (40 mS/cm) with large voltage window ( > 4 V) [312].
Nonetheless, ionic electrolytes are still found to suffer from low
potential reduction and poor cyclability. Numerous research works
have been carried out to develop highly conducting and stable elec-
trolytes with large voltage window [313,314]. The addition of CNTs
into ionic liquids is a new concept to form nanofluids. The fascinat-
ing properties of CNTs in terms of ultrahigh thermal conductivity
and large aspect ratio have been supporting their excellent disper-
sion in nanofluid preparation; the nanofluid offered enhanced ther-
mal conductivity and convective heat transfer coefficient [315]. The
addition of small amounts of SWCNTs (0.5 wt%) into ionic electrolyte
(EMIBF4) led to great enhancement of ionic conductivity (26.2 mS/
cm) and a high specific capacitance (63 F/g); the specific capacitance
was approximately 20% higher than that of pure ionic liquids, oper-
ated at 4 V [316]. However, the capacitance values in nanofluid, pure
ionic liquid, and organic electrolyte have decreased with time such
as 8%, 15%, and 20%, respectively. This decrement in capacitance can
be attributed to the presence of water or air in the electrolyte and
impurities (either metal or oxygen) in the electrodes. The presence
of impurities can aid in gradual decomposition of electrolyte. How-
ever, the addition of SWCNTs in ionic liquid supported the stabiliza-
tion of the electrolyte at upper limit of the voltage window (4 V).

P4.1.5. Challenges with electrochemical CNT-based supercapacitors

PAs technologies move from the laboratory to the marketplace, it
becomes essential to consider the environmental benefits of new
technologies compared to existing technologies in terms of both the
performance and the manufacturing implications. Supercapacitors
exhibit higher power densities (»10 times higher) with lower
energy densities than LIBs. They are used mainly in energy-harvest-
ing systems to intermittently store electricity that is generated from
renewable energy sources over short-term periods of time [317].
The demand for supercapacitors is increasing rapidly in consumer
electronics (e.g., laptops, portable speakers, digital cameras, and
mobile computing applications) and the energy/utility sector (e.g.,
actuators, photovoltaics, and wind turbines). The high-power energy
storage market is estimated to grow by almost 10 times to reach $2
billion per year by 2026 (from the present level of $240 million),
with the share of supercapacitors approaching half of this potential
market (between »$800 million and »$1 billion) [318].

PCNT-based electrodes are ideal due to their high surface areas for
storing charge. Most of them make use of liquid organic electrolytes
(e.g., tetraethylammonium-tetrafluoroborates in acetonitrile) to pro-
vide relatively high ionic mobility and fast charge/discharge kinetics
[319]. However, to ensure the safety and prevent environmental
issues associated with electrolyte leakage, the major focus is on
designing cell with appropriately rigid and robust packaging. For
automotive applications, supercapacitors should also have a much
wider functional temperature range. Solid-state supercapacitors
may be a better alternative to replace liquid electrolytes, using either
a polymer membrane or an ion-conducting gel. The structure of
solid-state supercapacitors allows them to be lighter and thinner
with greater design flexibility. As such, they are often times more
attractive for extended applications such as conformal energy stor-
age systems or future wearable electronics. However, solid-state

Psupercapacitors suffer from reduced ion mobility and reactivity rela-
tive to devices with liquid electrolytes [320].

PMany different research avenues can be explored to overcome
the aforementioned limitations. Such efforts will lead to the devel-
opment of solid-state electrolytes with high ionic mobility as well as
electrodes with high reactivity and ionic/electrical conductivity by
utilizing redox-active materials (e.g., transition MeOx, surface func-
tional groups, and electroactive polymers). Huang et al. reported
solid-state supercapacitors with rationally-designed,
layered p-
TiO2 + MWCNT/c-TiO2 + MWCNT/graphene electrodes (100(cid:1)600 nm
in thickness) made via spray processing [321]. These layered electro-
des offered a high charge storage capacity of 265.9 F/g (at a scan rate
of 5 mV/s); it was reported that the performance of these supercapa-
citors decreased in terms of the capacitance and power density as
the thickness of the electrodes increased, although the rate of mate-
rial utilization decreased. However, thicker electrodes are desirable
to increase the capacitance per unit area as well as to reduce the
overall current collector area. Thus, the main focus should be placed
on better utilization of active materials in uniformly-structured thick
electrodes for solid-state supercapacitors. Wang et al. developed
self-healing supercapacitors via spreading of functionalized-SWCNT
films over the self-healing substrates; they reported 85.7% restora-
tion of the initial specific capacitance, even after the fifth mechanical
cutting test (Fig. 10) [322]. As such, issues related to battery damage
in iPhones/iPads can be resolved. Besides restoring structural and
mechanical properties, focus was also given to recovering function-
ality after damage.

POn the market, SCA1800 (manufactured by Skeleton technolo-
the first commercial graphene-based supercapacitor
gies)
designed for use in spacecraft [323]. These devices are available at
2.85 V (with 500 to 3200 Farad cells) with a specific power density
upto 112 kW/kg and an energy density upto 68 Wh/kg.

4.2. Lithium-ion batteries

PLIBs, which exhibit superior energy density relative to other
options of rechargeable battery technologies, have drawn particular
attention for diverse applications, i.e., ranging from portable elec-
tronic devices to electric vehicles (as viable alternatives to combus-
tion engines). Among the many rechargeable battery technologies,
LIBs are low cost, safe, and have minimal side reactions while offer-
ing the best energy, voltage, capacity, and tap density [324(cid:1)327].
Fig. 11 shows the operating principles of LIBs along with the choice
of different materials for both the electrodes and electrolyte. During
the charge process, the battery functions by shuttling Li-ions from
the cathode to the anode throughout a non-aqueous electrolyte
(usually sandwiched between the electrodes). The lithium chemical
potential difference in between the two electrodes is the driving
force for this process. During discharging, the cathode is electro-
chemically reduced by intercalating Li-ions from the electrolyte,
while the anode is oxidized simultaneously. Thus, an electric current
flows throughout an external circuitry to perform the desired work
(i.e., running an electronic device). To ensure better performance of
rechargeable non-aqueous LIBs, the following design parameters
should be considered: (a) matching the chemical potential (mC) of
the cathode to the HOMO of the electrolyte as well as matching the
chemical potential (mA) of the anode to the LUMO of the electrolyte
and (b) high Li+ ion conductivity of the non-aqueous electrolyte over
an ambient temperature range (from ¡40 °C to 60 °C) [328].

PThe performance of LIBs, which is associated with their energy
content, is expressed in terms of the specific energy (Wh/kg) and
power density (Wh/L). In order to obtain a high specific energy, the
electrode materials must support the following conditions: (i) avail-
ability of large number of charge carriers per unit volume of the elec-
trode to ensure high specific charge (Ah/kg) and (ii) high and low

PComputer-based simulations of entirely new materials have
become increasingly popular due to the tremendous progress in
high-throughput calculations for rapid screening of thousands of
materials. Recently, computational investigations of specific battery
materials have been reviewed by Meng and Arroyo-de Dompablo
[329] and Islam and Fisher [330]. Here, it is worth emphasizing
both the computational and experimental development of LIBs
materials. Many efforts have been made to develop novel nano-
structured electrodes for LIBs that are environmentally compati-
lighter, and have larger storage
ble, highly stable,

thinner,

Pcapacity. Using nanostructured electrodes will also help address
limitations related to unwanted expansion in bulk crystalline
electrodes [331(cid:1)333].

PThe selection of appropriate materials for electrodes (both anode
and cathode) and electrolyte greatly affects the energy density, char-
ge(cid:1)discharge rates, cycle durability, and flexibility [334]. Nanostruc-
tured materials provide several benefits over
conventional
materials, such as reversible Li-intercalation and extraction without
destroying the material structure, large contact area with electro-
lyte, and increased Li-ion insertion/removal rates through short
transport pathways [335,336]. CNTs have been used as an ideal addi-
tive material for electrodes in LIBs [337]. The unique 1D tabular

Pstructure, enriched chirality, particularly large surface area, and high
thermal/electrical conductivities of CNTs are advantageous for their
use in electrochemical energy storage devices. Recently, several
research groups have reported hybrid nanostructures fabricated
through incorporation of CNTs and graphene into Li-ion storage
compounds for use as electrode materials; these hybrid materials
improve the conductivity and mechanical integrity of anodes and
cathodes for LIBs [338(cid:1)340]. Additionally, the enriched chirality and
the open structure of CNTs led to the modification of the capacity
and electron transport in LIBs. The storage mechanism is attributed
to Li+ filling of the interior space of CNTs. In this respect, CNTs
exhibit a storage capacity that is approximately two times larger
than graphite anode materials [341]. Fig. 12 shows the routes used
to incorporate CNTs into LIBs.

PIn comparison to conventional carbons, such as carbon black
and graphite, the use of CNTs in the form of conductive additive
offers a more effective way to form an electrical percolation net-
work at a lower weight loading. In the absence of any binder,
CNTs can be organized into free-standing electrodes by different
methods. Here, the function of CNTs is either to provide support
for anode materials or to act as an active Li-ion storage material.
The maximum storage capacity of CNT-based LIBs can exceed
1000 mA h/g, which is dependent on different experimental fac-
tors; this value is three times higher than that in comparison to
conventional LIBs [342,343].

P4.2.1. CNT-based anode materials

PLithium is the lightest metal with a specific gravity of 0.53 g/cm3;
it is also the most powerfully reducing element to yield a high
operating voltage ( > 3 V), appropriate cyclability, high energy den-
sity (110(cid:1)170 Wh/kg) driving capability, and cost effectiveness
[344,345]. Landi et al. theoretically calculated that the electrochemi-
cal capacity of Li to Li+ is approximately 3860 mA h/g [343]. How-
ever, the metallic Li in the form of a negative electrode material
causes several safety problems along with relatively high costs and
short lifetimes [346]. The other most common commercially-avail-
able LIB material is graphite. Graphite is appealing due to its excel-
lent features such as its low cost, good lifetime, high electronic
conductivity (i.e., a consequence of its delocalized p-bonds), and flat
and low working potential relative to lithium. Graphite-based ano-
des exhibit an appropriate structure for intercalation and diffusion
of Li-ions in between the weakly-bonded graphite layers [347].
Graphite anodes allow the intercalation of a single Li-ion with six

Pcarbon atoms, yielding a relatively limited power density and a theo-
retical gravimetric specific capacity upto 372 mA h/g [348]. At
level, LIBs have shown a specific capacity of
the experimental
280 mA h/g along with 96.1% capacity retention at 2.4 A/g over 1000
cycles; this was accomplished by using interlayer-expanded V6O13
nanosheets for the cathodes and lithiated graphite for the anodes
[349]. The thermal stability of lithiated-graphite is the major con-
cern from a safety point of view for LIBs, especially in case of auto-
motive and grid applications. For example, exposing a Li-ion cell to
an external temperature of 160 °C can cause thermal runway [350].

PThe major challenge in the LIBs is to improve the capacity and
cyclic life of their anode materials. The improvement in energy stor-
age greatly depends on the appropriate choice of electrode materials
and/or
the development of advanced materials that possess
improved energy and power density. There are numerous reports on
LIBs utilizing nanostructured carbonaceous materials (i.e., CNTs, gra-
phene sheets, and nanoporous carbon) with extremely diverse struc-
tures and morphologies [351(cid:1)354]. CNTs are one of the highly
promising anode materials because of their extremely rich electro-
chemical properties [355]. In comparison to graphite anodes, CNTs
exhibit excellent energy storage capacity ( > 1116 mA h/g theoreti-
cally) due to their novel structure and physical properties
[356(cid:1)358]. The diffusion rate of Li into carbon materials is 10¡12 to
10¡6 cm2/s, resulting in low power density; for comparison, the dif-
fusion rate is between 10¡9 and 10¡7 cm2/s in the case of graphite
[359].

PBoth SWCNTs and MWCNTs can be used as LIB anodes, either by
simply depositing them onto a current collector or by directly grow-
ing them onto a catalyst-pre-modified current collector. SWCNTs
and MWCNTs exhibit high theoretical conductivities (approx. 106
and 105 S/m, respectively) as well as good tensile strength (»60 GPa)
[360(cid:1)362]. The maximum theoretical
reversible capacity of
SWCNTs, after the introduction of defects in their walls, has been
calculated to be 1116 mA h/g in stoichiometric LiC2, which is the
highest reported value among carbonaceous materials [363(cid:1)365].
Frackowiak et al. reported that the reversible capacity of lithium
insertion for SWCNTs and MWCNTs ranges from 220 to 780 mA h/g
[366]. However, obtaining high coulombic efficiency with CNTs is
still a challenge. To address these issues, one should focus on the
morphological features of CNTs (e.g., the tube diameter, wall thick-
ness, shape, and porosity) [367(cid:1)371]. Determining the nature of Li-
intercalation in CNTs is a wide area of research; in particular, it is
very important to investigate the charge transfer between Li and

Pcarbonaceous materials along with the associated deformation in
CNT structures due to Li-intercalation [368]. A surface adsorption
mechanism was investigated by Yang et al. [369]; this involved the
storage of Li-ions over the naked surface of CNTs along with the Li-
ions intercalation into the closed ends of CNTs in 1 M LiClO4 EC/DEC
(having a ratio of 50:50). CNTs with closed ends exhibited a revers-
ible capacity of »125 mA h/g and formed a surface film at 0.8 V. Zhao
et al. reported the Li-ions intercalation in SWCNTs (in case of both
zigzag and armchair structure) using the first principle method
[370]. They concluded that the intercalation of Li-ions into CNTs
(both the inside and outside) gave a higher Li density, independent
of the Li density around LiC2.

PTheoretical research works based on density functional theory
(DFT) methods have provided a clear understanding of the Li-ion
storage capacity of CNTs. The use of these methods allowed research-
ers to assess how variations in the nature and weight of materials
affected the capacity calculations in LIBs. Khantha et al. reported the
diffusion of Li-ions in armchair (5,5) CNTs, in both radial and axial
directions, using DFT calculations [371]. They reported the favorable
Li-ion positions, which occurred along a straight line that passed
through (i) the center of the carbon hexagonal ring (on one side of
the wall) and (ii) the mid-point of the C(cid:1)(cid:1)C bond (on the opposite
side) for a Li-ion moving in a radial direction. Some theoretical stud-
ies also focused on the preferential interactions of Li+ with SWCNTs
of different chiralities via molecular dynamic simulations based on
DFT [372,373]. DFT calculations can yield Li-binding energies and the
intercalation capacity of identical CNTs. It was observed that Li-ions
quickly penetrated into CNTs and in between neighboring CNTs;
these ions are able to move from one end to the other. With a low
density, Li-ions tend to stay close to the CNT ends.

PIn CNT-based LIBs, the Li-intercalation capacity is directly associ-
ated to the morphology of CNTs located near active materials like
LiC6 [374(cid:1)376]. Structural defects, either occurring naturally or
induced artificially, affect the morphologies of CNTs, thereby exert-
ing an impact on their capacities [377,378]. Li-ions diffuse more eas-
ily in CNTs that have holes in their side walls (caused by the
introduction of defects) in comparison to defect-free nanotubes
[379]. However, defect-containing CNTs with open ends must have
short lengths to ensure better performance with a reasonable ion-
exchange rate. Inside the nanotubes, Li-ions undergo a random 1D
walk; thus, a longer nanotube length can decrease their effective dif-
fusion. Kawasaki et al. reported the lithium insertion capacities of
CNTs depending on the chirality [380]. It was found that metallic
CNTs supported a higher lithium insertion capacity (»400% higher)
relative to semiconducting ones. Thus, the fundamental factors
directing Li-kinetics inside CNTs are their diameters, lengths, chiral-
ity, and structural defects. Optimizing these factors in the design of
LIBs can lead to a desirable increase in their reversible capacity;
however, the irreversible capacity was also seen to increase by the

Ppermanent diffusion of Li-ions at the anode during the first cycle
without the possibility of restoration at the cathode [328].

PTo modify the structural and electrochemical properties of CNTs,
various pre- and post-treatments have been developed, as shown in
Fig. 13. A large variation can be seen in the reversible Li-storage
capacity of MWCNT anodes prepared by catalytic decomposition, e.
g., from 400 to 200 mg h/g with slightly-graphitized to highly-graph-
itized decomposition [381]. Similarly, the use of different prepara-
tion techniques (e.g., CVD,
laser ablation, and spray pyrolysis)
can cause a vivid change in the electrochemical performance of
MWCNTs. Thermal CVD-grown, purified MWCNT anodes exhibit a
reversible storage capacity of 311 mA h/g as well as an irreversible
capacity of 1012 mA h/g [382]. Ball-milling influences the Li-interca-
lation properties in comparison to CVD-grown MWCNTs, increasing
the reversible capacity upto 641 mA h/g. The irreversible capacity
was also reduced to 518 mA h/g, which directly corresponds to the
higher coulombic efficiency relative to purified MWCNTs.

PThe capacity of metallic CNTs (641 mA h/g) was reported to be far
superior to that of semiconducting CNTs (131 mA h/g) [380]. Fur-
thermore, the effect of doping in CNT-based anodes was observed to
enhance the performance of LIBs. The extent of Li adsorption and the
charge distribution were greatly distinguished according to the elec-
tronic structure of the dopants (e.g., boron vs. nitrogen). Boron-
doped CNTs exhibited higher Li-absorption capabilities due to the
electron-deficient structure in the nanotubes. In contrast, N-CNTs
suffered from a reduction in their Li-insertion capacity due to the
electron-rich structure of the doped nanotubes, which hindered the
absorption of Li [383(cid:1)385]. Yang et al. reported higher Li-intercala-
tion into CNTs that were pre-doped with Li relative to neat CNTs and
open-ended CNTs [386]. The presence of Li-rich compounds doped
on the electrode surface can help avoid the solvent decomposition,
yielding a good reversible capacity of 200 mA h/g and a high coulom-
bic efficiency of »100% after the second cycle. Zhang et al. reported
the porous CNT webs co-doped with high levels of boron and nitro-
gen (approxi. 15.05 at.% and 6.71 at.%, respectively) (BN-PCNTs)
through the use of PPy nanotubes (as a precursor) [387]. Thus, due
to the high doping levels and porous structure, the BN-PCNT anodes
exhibited a high reversible capacity of 900 mA h/g at a high current
density of 200 mA/g.

PNitrogen-doped MWCNTs with extrinsic defects were proposed
to improve the Li storage capability [388]. Because of the wall
defects present in nitrogen-doped MWCNTs, Li+ can be diffused to
occupy a large portion of the inter-wall space, which acts as a stor-
age region. When nickel oxide (3 mm) was used as dopant, a Li-ion
cell offered an excellent capacity of 3500 mA h/g with a cycling
life > 10,000 cycles and a 1.5 min discharge rate capability, while
showing a low capacity retention of 350 mA h/g. Lahiri et al. reported
alumina-coated CNT anodes with the best reversible capacity of
1100 mA h/g under 2 V after 50 cycles. This value is almost three

Ptimes higher than the theoretical capacity of graphitic anodes
(372 mA h/g) [389]. MWCNTs that have undergone acid treatment
can maintain 90% of their original capacity with an increase in their
current density from 0.8 to 5 A/g [390]. The major issues that limit
the use of CNT anodes are related to their irreversible charge loss
just after the first cycle, which occurs due to the layer formation of
solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the nanotubes and their uni-
form distribution into electrodes.

P4.2.2. CNTs as conductive additives in anode materials

PAs discussed earlier, synthesis and treatment techniques greatly
drive the performance in terms of the reversible capacity of CNT-
based anodes. Besides the high reversible capacity of CNT-based
anodes, there are several issues that need to be considered. These
include (a) the limited practical applicability of CNT-based anodes
due to their high irreversible capacity, (b) a high capacity loss during
(charge/discharge) cycles caused by the detrimental surface reac-
tions with electrolyte solution species, and (c) the increased elec-
trode impedance due to intense surface films [391,392]. In order to
resolve these issues, several approaches have been proposed, involv-
ing the use of CNTs as a conducting additive, as summarized in
Table 12. Many CNT composites with diverse Li-storage materials (e.
g., SnO2 and TiO2) have been developed for use as anode materials
[393(cid:1)395]. The combination of MWCNTs with Li-storage metals and
MeOx can help hinder the agglomeration as well as improve the elec-
tronic conductivity of electrode materials. Attaching active materials
to CNTs by a thioglycolic acid-assisted wet method should help
enhance the charge capacities and durability against decay [396].
Abouali et al. confirmed the in situ synthesis of NiCo2O4 (NCO)/CNT
composite electrodes for LIBs with a very high capacity of
1020 mA h/g at a moderate current density of 300 mA/g after 200
cycles; these showed an excellent capacity retention (»99%) after
100 cycles [397]. This excellent energy storage behavior of the NCO/
CNT composite electrodes can be ascribed to the strong attachment
of evenly-dispersed NCO nanoparticles over the surface of function-
alized CNTs.

PPorous core-sheath CNT/Li4Ti5O12 coaxial nanocables were syn-
thesized through a sol(cid:1)gel method for use as anodes in LIBs [398].
These coaxial nanocables exhibited superior cycling stability, excel-
lent rate capability, high current density, and a high reversible
capacity of 322.5 mA h/g (at a current density of 200 mA/g) after
testing for 200 cycles; they also showed a good discharge capacity of
198.7 mA h/g (at a current density of 2000 mA/g) for upto 2000
cycles. Therefore, nanocable structure-based anodes are potential

Pcandidates for the development of novel electrochemical energy
storage devices with high power capacity and long cyclic life.
Peng et al. reported a 3D anode using core-shell structured
Sn(cid:1)Ni(cid:1)Cu(cid:1)alloy@carbon nanorods made by pulse nanoelectrode-
position and a thermal treatment [399]. LIBs with 3D anodes exhib-
ited almost 100% capacity retention at 450 mA/g over 400 cycles
with excellent rate performance (upto 9000 mA/g). The role of the
shell is to keep the volume stable for an extended number of charge/
discharge cycles in energy storage devices. Cao et al. designed core-
sheath MWCNT/TiO2 nanocables that obtained an appropriate
reversible capacity of »406 mA h/g (at a current density of 0.05 A/g)
[400]. Similarly, Reddy et al. demonstrated a coaxial MnO2/CNT array
electrode, made via the in situ growth of CNTs within the active elec-
trode material, by using an Au current collector on one side [401].
The highly-conductive CNTs are advantageous for improving elec-
tron transport through the MnO2 shell. In addition, CNTs can offer
additional sites for Li storage with enhanced reversible capacities.
Using a multifunctional CNT-CoF2 electrode, a high theoretical
capacity of 550 mA h/g has been observed under a current density of
10 mA/g [402]. These authors found that 50% of the initial capacity
can be retained under a very high current density of 1000 mA/g.

PAmong semiconductors, silicon has been widely explored as an
anode active material that offered a very high theoretical capacity of
»4200 mA h/g [403]. However, Li-insertion/extraction from these
silicon anodes is escorted by a large volumetric change of 300%. This
volume change can cause the development of a strong strain on the
silicon, causing a decrease in the electrical contact in between the
current collector and silicon; this also results in rapid capacity decay.
CNTs have been introduced into silicon anodes to overcome these
intolerable capacity losses [404,405]. Due to their stability at high
temperatures and large amount of chemically-active surfaces, CNT
networks offer support for the dispersion and stabilization of semi-
conducting nanoparticles. Shu et al. have grown coiled CNTs with
different lengths on superfine silicon nanoparticles via a CVD
method [406]. The use of CNT/Si composite as the active anode
material led to a high reversible capacity of 940 mA h/g along with a
high coulombic efficiency of 80% for the first cycle. Weng et al.
reported a 3D-aligned CNT/Si composite electrode for flexible and
stable LIBs with a delithiation capacity of 2562 mA h/g (at a current
density of 1 A/g) and an excellent capacity retention of 93% after 100
cycles [407]. Lin et al. also proposed an aligned CNT/silicon compos-
ite fiber anode in the form of a core-sheath structure for LIBs [408].
This was accomplished by a thin layer deposition of silicon over the
surface of aligned MWCNTs; accordingly, they observed a much

Phigher specific capacity of 1548 mA h/g (at a current density of 2 A/g)
with a silicon weight of 38.1%. Likewise, a CNT-Si composite anode,
developed via a ball-milling process, yielded a high discharge capac-
ity of 2364 mA h/g (at a tap density of 1.103 g/cm) [409]. Because the
CNT-Si composite and Li[Ni0.85Co0.05Mn0.10]O2 were used in the LIB
(as the anode and cathode materials, respectively); this full cell
exhibited a high energy density of 350 W h/kg along with an excel-
lent capacity retention over 500 cycles at a discharge rate of 1 C (a
current of 1 C corresponds to 200 mA/g). However, despite the supe-
rior performance, this Si core(cid:1)shell anode suffered from fracture as
well as detachment of the shell due to the occurrence of small
cracks, caused by contraction and expansion of the anodes.

PRecently, the use of carbonaceous composites as anode materials
has received significant attention due to their ordered electrode con-
figuration and large surface area [410,411]. In graphene/CNT compo-
sites, graphene nanosheets can efficiently suppress the aggregation
of CNTs. Additionally, CNTs can help bridge graphene nanosheets to
support rapid electron transfer and mechanical robustness [412]. As
an example, using graphene oxide/graphite/CNTs composites as LIB
anodes led to a very high reversible capacity of 1172.5 mA h/g (at a
discharge rate of 0.5 C, where 1 C = 372 mA/g) with a high capacity
retention of 89.6% [413]. Many recent studies were directed to free-
standing CNT electrodes; these are usually buckypapers devised
from carboxyl-functionalized CNTs [414(cid:1)416]. The incorporation of
buckypaper for free-standing electrodes in energy storage devices
should be beneficial for the development of flexible and safe storage
device for energy. Such devices are currently gaining much attention
due to their flexibility, lightweight, and shape diversity. As such,
their applications are expected to be extended considerably for the
development of innovative products like roll-up displays, smart
cards, and implantable medical devices. Paper batteries are one of
the most common examples of flexible energy storage devices, as
discussed later in Section 4.2.4.

PThe future perspectives of LIBs are dedicated to the development
of 3D nanostructured CNT-based anode materials. CNTs provide a
route to obtain open 3D architectures for broad applications related
to energy storage. In this respect, 3D-nanostructured CNTs are
advantageous in terms of their high surface area, high loading of
active materials, and small diffusion length of Li-ions; thus, they can
contribute to the improved performance of advanced LIBs [417]. Wu
et al. prepared Ni foam/3D N-CNT/NiO nanosheet electrodes for lith-
ium storage [418]. They observed a high discharge capacity of
2278 mA h/g after the first cycle (at a current density of 0.2 A/g),
based on the weight of NiO. These anodes offered a higher specific
capacity of 1721 mA h/g (at a current density of 0.1 A/g), while main-
taining a value of 1633 mA h/g (with a capacity retention of 104.4%
after 50 cycles at 0.2 A/g). Qin et al. fabricated the 3D network of a
Zn2SnO4/CNT composite via a facile hydrothermal process [419].
Such 3D anodes also exhibited high initial charge and discharge
capacities of 1064.9 mA h/g and 1925.4 mA h/g, respectively at a cur-
rent density of 100 mA/g, corresponding to a good coulombic effi-
ciency of 55.31%. These 3D anodes also offered better capacity
retention in terms of the reversible capacity (703.8 mA h/g at a dis-
charge rate of 100 mA/g after testing for 30 cycles). The presence of
3D conductive channels supported enhanced rate capabilities for
LIBs.

P4.2.3. CNTs as conductive additives in cathode materials

PIn LIBs, the active cathode materials are the key components that
determine the functional performance of batteries. A large number
of materials have been explored as cathode materials for LIBs,
including LiCoO2 [420], LiNiO2 [421], LiMnO2 [422], spinel LiMn2O4
[423], LiFePO4 [424], LiMPO4 [425], and elemental sulfur [426].
Among those options, LiCoO2 and LiFePO4 have been the most com-
mon choices over the last two decades due to their facile prepara-
tion, good cycle life ( > 500 cycles), and stable electrochemical

Pcycling performance. The maximum theoretical reversible capacity
of LiCoO2 is 274 mA h/g; moreover, in practice, a reversible capacity
of 140 mA h/g is typically achieved because only half of the Li-ions
can be reversibly inserted and/or extracted from LiCoO2-based cath-
odes [427]. It should be mentioned that the utilization of lithium
should be confined to less than 50% in order to assuage safety con-
cerns. LiFePO4-based cathode materials have 1D channels for lith-
ium-ion diffusion; thus, there is an increased possibility of channel
blockage due to defects and impurities [428,429]. Although LiFePO4
is well-known to have low cost, high stability, and high compatibility
with the environment, it suffers from poor electronic/ionic conduc-
tivities (10¡10 S/cm and 10¡8, respectively) and a low reversible
capacity. More recently, two strategies (i.e., doping with ions [430]
and coating with carbon [431]) were developed to enhance the ionic
and electronic conductivities of LiFePO4, respectively. It was demon-
strated that LiFePO4-based cathodes dispersed in a nanoporous car-
bon matrix improved the electrochemical performance and yielded
high power and energy [432]. However, the high cost of cobalt and
its related safety concerns have promoted the development of new
cathode materials to obtain electrodes with lower cost, small size,
low weight, better safety characteristics, higher discharge currents,
and longer life. The incorporation of CNTs into such materials will
further drive the development of high-performance LIBs.

PFor CNT-based composite electrodes, CNTs should possess good
chemical bonding with the active cathode materials (such as
LiFePO4, LiCoO2, and LiMPO4) as opposed to simply being blended
with the electrode material. In this way, CNTs work as a current col-
lector to offer fast transport pathways, good mechanical strength,
and large specific surface area. There are a number of ways to intro-
duce CNTs into the active electrode materials to ensure better inte-
rior connections; this can be done by simply adding them to the
precursor during the early stages of active electrode material proc-
essing or by growing them within the active electrode material
[433]. The possible use of CNT-loaded LiFePO4/carbon hybrid nano-
fibers was examined as a more stable and binder-free electrode
[434,435]. Toprakci et al. synthesized LiFePO4/CNT/C nanofiber elec-
trodes using a combined electrospinning and sol(cid:1)gel methods
[436]. To this end, graphene and LiFePO4 precursor were dispersed
in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) separately so that their mixing
can proceed with PAN solution. LiFePO4/graphene/C composite
nanofibers were obtained by heat-treating electrospun fibers. The
LiFePO4/CNT/C nanofiber electrodes offered highly improved elec-
trochemical performance with a reversible capacity of 169 mA h/g
after 50 cycles (at a discharge rate of 0.05 C or 8.5 mA/g). In terms of
the cyclic performance and rate performance, the CNT-based com-
posite electrode outperformed bare LiFePO4 (reversible capacity:
135 mA h/g) and LiFePO4/C hybrid materials (reversible capacity:
161 mA h/g).

PThe function of CNTs in LiFePO4 is important for improving the
electron transport because they form conduction bridges between
LiFePO4 particles. Using this strategy, LiFePO4/CNT hybrid electrodes
were synthesized by an in situ sol(cid:1)gel process [437]. CNTs were
penetrated through and among the pores of LiFePO4 particles, which
formed a hierarchical structure with enhanced electrochemical per-
formance. LiFePO4 is a promising cathode material that exhibits
numerous advantages such as low cost, superior thermal stability,
environmental compatibility, and safety. LiFePO4/CNT hybrid mate-
rials can efficiently promote the diffusion of Li-ions with lower
charge transfer resistance. Carbonaceous materials tend to be prefer-
able for wiring the surface of LiFePO4 particles to improve their elec-
tronic conductivity. A unique hierarchical and porous C@LiFePO4/
CNTs microsphere composite cathode was fabricated via a facile
hydrothermal approach with high-temperature calcinations [438].
The C@LiFePO4/CNTs composite offered a high rate capability of
73 mA h/g (at a discharge rate of 60 C), high volumetric energy den-
sity of 443 Wh/L (at a discharge rate of 10 C), and excellent cyclic

Pstability with 98% capacity retention over 1000 cycles (at a discharge
rate of 10 C). It also maintained a high reversible capacity of
113 mA h/g (at a discharge rate of 10 C) over 1000 cycles (Table 13).
Hwang et al. reported a multifunctional CNT coating for a high volt-
age cathode material (LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4), which was fabricated through
a mechano-fusion method [439]. The oxidized CNT coating over
LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cathode exhibited an excellent coulomb efficiency of
99.9% after 80 cycles (from 3.5 to 4.9 V) with an enhanced discharge
capacity retention of 95.5%. The CNT coating over the oxide cathodes
prevented unfavorable carbothermal reduction while supporting
high power density and long cyclic life in LIBs [440,441]. The carbo-
naceous materials are favourable in resolving the issues of side-reac-
tions at the active cathode materials/electrolyte interface.

PIn some recent studies, binder-free composite electrodes were
developed and employed as high-performance LIBs [442,443].
Because binders are electrochemically inactive, they can be used to
make mechanical connection between the active electrode materials
and the conductive additives. However, these insulating binders add
additional weight in electrodes and cause poor charge carrier trans-
fer during charge/discharge cycling; this causes the overall energy
density of the device to be reduced significantly. There are several
methods that can be used to obtain binder-free composite electro-
des, such as loading functional particles onto CNT nanosheets (e.g.,
through filtration, evaporation, spraying, sol(cid:1)gel methods, electro-
phoresis, and so on) [444-447]. Luo et al. developed 3D flexible
LiCoO2 (95 wt%)/super-aligned CNTs (SACNTs) (5 wt%) via an ultra-
sonication and co-deposition route [448]. These binder-free compos-
ite (LiCoO2/SACNT) electrodes exhibited great flexibility, high
electrical conductivity, high rate capability (137.4 mA h/g at a dis-
charge rate of 2 C with a very high capacity retention of 90.8% after
20 cycles), and outstanding cycling stability (151.4 mA h/g at a dis-
charge rate of 0.1 C with an excellent capacity retention of 98.4%
after 50 cycles). Thus, introducing CNTs into LIBs provides percola-
tion networks for improved electron transport and good mechanical
stability in the cathode. The use of graphene (0.2 wt%) and Super-P
(1 wt%) conductive additives helped in constructing efficient con-
ducting network with LiCoO2 electrode that offered excellent capac-
ity retention performance (96.4%) of LIBs after the 50th cycle at 1 C
[449].

PTypically, using elemental materials as the cathodes for LIBs pro-
duces excellent cycle life, an inherently high discharging capacity,
and low cost. The use of intrinsically-conducting polymers (ICP) (e.
g., PAni, PPy, polypyrrole, and polythiophene) was found to offer
several benefits (e.g., lower cost, longer cycle life, more flexibility in
the structure, lower self-discharge rate, and higher endurance to

LIBs with MeOx
[451(cid:1)453]. Among all polymers, PAni was reported as the most
favorable material for cathodes due to its excellent stability in air
and aqueous solutions, good redox reversibility, and easy prepara-
tion via low-cost electrochemical methods [427]. Trinh et al.
reported LIBs with a discharge capacity of 75 mA h/g (at 0.1 C) using
free-standing PEDOT-LiFePO4 composite electrodes prepared by
dynamic three-phase interline electropolymerization (D3PIE) [454].
PDespite their many merits, polymer electrodes were also found to
suffer from several problems (e.g., adherence, conductivity, and sta-
bility issues). Thus, many recent studies have focused on introducing
CNTs and graphene into polymers to improve their electronic prop-
erties [455,456]. The surface modification of CNTs with polyvinyl-
pyrrolidone helped in uniform dispersion of CNTs without breaking,
destructing, and entangling effects in LiFePO4 cathodes [458]. Song
et al. developed nanocomposites by combining graphene with poly
(anthraquinonyl sulfide) and polymide, which are two of the most
promising polymer cathode materials [459]. Utilizing polymer/gra-
phene composite electrodes in LIBs led to impressive electronic con-
ductivity and ultrafast charging/discharging properties, delivering
more than 100 mA h/g within a few seconds. Using hybrid nanocom-
posites (PVC/CNTs) as cathode materials led to much better perfor-
mance than pure PVC materials in terms of the considerably
enhanced discharge capacity (i.e., 115 mA h/g over 45 mA h/g in case
of pure PVC materials) [460]. Beyond conventional cathodes, Li2Fe-
SiO4/CNT cathodes can afford a high capacity of 214 mA h/g with a
very high capacity retention of 96% over 40 cycles [461]. As such,
these composites hold a great potential to be used as a promising
cathode material for the development of future flexible LIBs.

P4.2.4. CNT-based paper-like LIBs

PThere is strong interest in flexible, binder-free, lightweight, cur-
rent collector-free, and mechanically-stable electrodes in energy
storage devices to meet the needs of a diverse range of modern
applications (e.g., wearable electronic devices, radio frequency sens-
ing, interactive packaging, and bendable reading devices). In recent
years, paper or paper-like batteries have gained significant attention
due to the advancement in paper electronics that allowed for the
direct integration of a power source onto paper with an intrinsically
rough and porous surface. This development is expected to enable
charge carrier transport to be manipulated across the entire struc-
ture [462(cid:1)465]. Over the past few years, many LIBs with astonishing
characteristics (e.g., flexible, bendable, stretchable, or foldable) have
been proposed as potential candidates for flexible power sources

Pdue to their long cycle life and high volumetric and gravimetric
energy density [466(cid:1)469].

PIn conventional LIBs, binders and current collectors are intro-
duced in order to prevent the collapse of active electrode materials
from the current collectors and to maintain the electrode conductiv-
ity, respectively. However, theuse of these components can cause
dead weight in the Li storage device, which ultimately can cause a
reduction in the energy density of LIBs. In order to overcome such
limitations, the potential use of flexible LIBs has been explored. The
tremendous intrinsic characteristics of flexible LIBs (e.g., large sur-
face roughness and porous structure) have been recognized to lead
to better power generation, mechanical flexibility, and acceptable
cycling performance to fully support flexible electronics that are
environmentally-friendly. For flexible batteries, cellulose was used
as a binder/separator while nanoscale-structured materials (e.g.,
CNT paper, carbon nanofibers, graphene paper, and graphene foam)
were as employed as electrodes with high surface area. The ease
with which CNT paper can be handled, offers a high degree of flexi-
bility in a variety of lightweight and flexible electronic devices that
can be made via low cost and roll-to-roll printing processes.

PLIBs were integrated on a single paper sheet through an easy lam-
ination process with free-standing CNTs film (0.2 mg/cm2) as current
collectors for both electrodes (i.e., anode and cathode) [470]. These
free-standing CNT films were also seen to function effectively as sep-
arators with low impedance and good cyclability (e.g., no degrada-
tion of LIBs after 300 cycles of recharging). The reported LIBs had a
high energy density of 108 mWh/g, robust mechanical stability, and
an extremely thin (»300 mm) structure. Chew et al. fabricated
binder-free and free-standing CNT films made from CNTs with dif-
ferent structures (such as SWCNTs, DWCNTs, and MWCNTs) through
a simple vacuum filtration process [471]. The performance of all
these CNT films were compared as anode materials in LIBs, and the
MWCNT films exhibited the most stable cyclic behavior with a high
reversible charge capacity of 300 mA/h. Specifically, when their per-
formance was compared in terms of the coulombic efficiency, it was
observed to follow the order of MWCNT films (80% in second cycle),
SWCNT films (59%), and DWCNT films (57%). Cui et al. reported the
integration of a conductive CNTs network into a silicon anode to pro-
duce a very high specific charge storage capacity of 2000 mA h/g and
a long cycle life [403]. This network exhibited a considerable
improvement (»10 times) in the specific capacity relative to graph-
ite/copper anode materials. Li et al. reported binder- and current col-
lector-free CNT films dispersed onto a polypropylene separator with
high specific capacitance values of 863 mA h/g and 281 mA h/g,
respectively [472].

PDespite the many benefits of paper LIBs, some major shortcom-
ings remain to be resolved, including issues related to the paper
crystallinity and first cycle charge loss in case of free-standing CNT-
based electrodes. These issues can be overwhelmed by using free-
standing CNT electrodes with either conductive polymers [473,474]
or high capacity materials such as Si or Ge [475,476]. In light of their
inherent flexibility, organic materials (mainly polymers like polyace-
tylene and polyaniline) are preferable for the development of flexi-
ble LIBs. Wu et al. reported a binder-free, flexible, and polymerized
polymide (PI)/SWCNTs electrode where nanoporous SWCNTs films
(12 mm in thickness; and area density of 0.5 mg/cm2) and polymer-
ized PI layer acted as a current collector and an active electrode
material, respectively [477]. The PI/SWCNT electrode-based LIBs
exhibited a specific capacity of 206 mA h/g with an 85% capacity
retentionafter 200 cycles and an excellent coulombic efficiency of
99.6% over 200 cycles [477].

PThe nanoporous structure of SWCNTs and vertically-aligned
nanoflake structures of polymerized PI on SWCNT films appear to be
highly promising for the fabrication of high performance LIBs. Lei-
jonmarck et al. used nano-fibrillated cellulose for both the electrode
binder and separator material; they reported a good reversible

Pcapacity of 101 mA h/g at a discharge rate of 1 C [478]. A SWCNT/pol-
ycellulose (PP) paper LIB was also developed with polycellulose
papers dipped in a CNT ink; these devices exhibited a discharge
capacity of 153.3 mA h/g along with a high coulombic efficiency of
90.6% at a discharge rate of 0.1 C [479]. Hu et al. also reported a new
structure for thin and flexible LIBs by using paper as the separator
and free-standing CNTs as the current collectors; these components
can be integrated over a single paper sheet via a simple lamination
procedure, as shown in Fig. 14 [480]. The rechargeable Li-ion paper
battery exhibited a thin structure (approxi. 300 mm in thickness), a
high energy density (108 mWh/g), and robust mechanical flexibility
(potential of bending down to less than 6 mm).

PIn summary, paper or paper-like LIBs may be a future power
source for current/power generation. The simple manufacturing pro-
cess and low cost of CNT paper make it an appealing alternative to
replace traditional metallic channels. Because Li-ion paper batteries
are more flexible, rechargeable, and durable, they can produce more
power than other electrochemical batteries.

P4.2.5. Challenges with CNT-based LIBs

PRechargeable LIBs are found on the market due to their many
known merits (i.e., superior cyclic stability, high energy, and power
density). In the modern era, LIBs have spurred the revolution of digi-
tal electronics; these are exclusively used in the consumer market
and for industrial applications such as in mobile phones, laptop com-
puters, tablets, electric vehicles, renewable energy power stations,
and satellites. Fig. 15 shows the historical developments in battery
technologies, moving from Pb-acid batteries [481,482] to LIBs
[483,484]. It also includes some mid-range battery technologies (e.
g., Ni(cid:1)Cd [485,486] and Ni(cid:1)MH [487,488] batteries) as well as
potential future batteries (including paper batteries) [489,490].

PIn the early 1990s, the Sony Corporation first commercialized
LixC6/Li1¡xCoO2 cells [491]. In comparison to Ni(cid:1)Cd or Ni(cid:1)metal
batteries, LIBs offer a low self-discharge rate and a broader tempera-
ture range without noticeable voltage depression [492]. However,
they face several technological barriers, including their insufficient
life cycle, high cost, poor safety considerations, and the fact that
they overheat during charge/discharge cycles. These barriers should
be resolved before the deployment of LIBs at a large scale. Thus,
numerous research efforts have been made to resolve these barriers
and meet the needs of the market (e.g., increased energy density,
high power density, low cost, and enhanced safety) [493,494]. The
developmental history of batteries mainly lies in improving the
energy density as well as power density, whereas minimizing the
mass and volumetric constraints. The appropriate combinations of
anode and cathode materials can further help reduce the thermal
ion intercalation(cid:1)deintercalation
effects
[495,496]. Alternatively, the implementation of sophisticated con-
trol techniques for active cooling has added significant weight and
complexity to battery design. Moreover, the thermal and electrical
gradients of electrodes can cause unbalanced charging and discharg-
ing, ultimately lowering the energy storage capacity [497(cid:1)499].

associated with Li+

PProper thermal management of LIBs is a wide area of research
that should be investigated for the appropriate development and
selection of electrodes (anode/cathode) materials. Koo et al. reported
MWCNTs as a matrix for the encapsulation of active cathode materi-
als, prepared by a scalable and inexpensive filtration method [500].
The resulting CNTs/{g-Fe2O3-nanoparticles on CNTs}/CNTs-struc-
tured electrodes, without current collectors, offered a moderate spe-
cific capacity of 187 mA h/g with excellent stability (approximately
zero fading during 300 cycles), excellent coulombic efficiency of
99.9%, and two orders of magnitude enhancement in the thermal
conductivity of LIBs. These CNT-structured electrodes hold great
promise for further improvement in the specific capacity via the
incorporation of diverse nanomaterials (e.g., graphene and diamond
nanoparticles). To enhance the energy density of LIBs, combined

Fig. 14. Schematic of rechargeable Li-ion paper battery. CNTs were dispersed in deionized water under sonication. After that, polycellulose papers were dipped into CNT ink. The
soaked polycellulose papers were taken out on alumina/silver foil. After drying the soaked papers, CNTs/polymer papers were cut into different shapes. CNTs/polymer papers
were used as conductive current collectors after dipping the paper into nitric acid. To prepare the battery, the CNT/polymer current collectors were dipped into different electro-
des (anode/cathode) slurries.

Pefforts are also needed to increase the anode and cathode density.
CNT-based anodes show tremendous promise; however, in catho-
des, the performance of CNTs is greatly limited by their interaction
with active materials.

PAnother major area of research is the advancement in highly effi-
cient (in terms of the capacity) cathode systems that combine a
high-capacity active material with light-weight CNTs as the current
collectors. Advanced LIBs make use of free-standing CNT paper to
replace the current collector, where composite active slurries are
coated onto the CNT paper. The reduced weight in LIBs that use
CNTs was reported to yield enhanced energy density [501]. Future
research on the performance improvement of LIBs depends on
increasing the surface area, reducing transport distances (e.g., by
reducing the distance between electrodes), and allowing the use of
different materials (that tend to have unacceptable flaws when used
in their bulk forms, like silicon). Coating electrodes is an appropriate
method to improve their stability and performance in storage devi-
ces. Table 14 shows commercially-available CNT-based conductive
additives that can be used in LIBs [502(cid:1)504].

PThe major issue currently facing LIBs is their failure due to ther-
mal runaway, which can cause permanent damage in battery cells.
Several stages participate in the building-up of thermal runaway: (a)
SEI layer breakdown at anode layer due to overheating caused by
excessive currents; (b) transfer of heat from the anode to the electro-
lyte, causing breakdown of the organic solvents present in the elec-
trolyte;(c) short-circuiting between electrodes as the separator
melts due to excessive heat; and (d) breakdown of the MeOx cathode
due to transfer of heat from the electrolyte [505,506]. The major rea-
sons of failure are either gradual loss of charge or the inability of
electrodes to work under diverse environmental conditions. More-
over, there are also many other issues associated with LIBs such as
low rate compatibility, voltage stability, and
their cyclability,

Pelectrode/cell fabrication. There is also a great need to focus on the
potential environmental impacts of battery technologies to avoid
using scarce and non-renewable resources, like Ni/Co-based oxides,
and toxic non-aqueous electrolytes. Thus, emphasis should also be
placed on researching recyclable and green technologies that use
organic materials to design new batteries. Beyond this, the success
of next-generation LIBs relies on the development of advanced lith-
ium-ion cell chemistries, while more research into the cycle life and
tolerance are needed to improve the energy density and power den-
sity with the reduction of the cost.

4.3. CNTs for emerging high-energy density rechargeable batteries

PNowadays, numerous research efforts have been directed toward
post
lithium-ion technologies that promise high gravimetrical
energy densities at reduced material costs like lithium sulfur and
lithium air batteries. The lithium(cid:1)sulfur batteries can be an alterna-
tive to LIBs due to low cost of sulfur, high theoretical capacity of
approxi. 1675 mA h/g, and specific energy density of 2500 Wh/kg
[507]. However, there are several issues in their commercialization
such as severe capacity fade and poor electronic conductivity of sul-
fur. To overcome all these challenges, sulfur loaded-porous CNF
cathodes have been reported to enhance the utilization of sulfur
with cycle stabilitywith the availability of pores in carbon frame-
work [508]. Through the use of carbon nanomaterials with polymer
coating, the sulfur utilization can be enhanced upto 1320 mAh/gsulfur
[509]. The incorporation of CNTs enables the production of a light
weight sulfur cathode while hindering the polysulfide dissolution.
CNTs can act as conductive scaffolds to host sulfur, thereby, contrib-
utes to the maintenance of high mass/areal/volumetric capacities
(563.7 mA h/g/0.893 mA h/cm2/200.1 mA h/cm2) at high sulfur load-
ing (90 wt%) [510]. Lee et al. fabricated sulfur-immobilized activated

Pporous CNT (S-a-PCNT) cathode via a dual-nozzle co-electrospinning
method [511]. The S-a-PCNT cathode offered enhanced electrochem-
ical utilization of sulfur (a loading amount of 4.6 mg/cm2) with high
cycle stability, i.e., a specific discharge capacity of 917 mA h/g (which
is 73% of its initial value) after 300 cycles at 0.2 C rate. The areal sul-
fur loading and amount of electrolyte have a significant impact over
reversible cycle of batteries; constant amount of electrolyte
(72.4 mL/mgsulfur) with low sulfur loading (20 wt%) at high rate (2.5
C) offered a high discharge capacity of 1190 mA h/g after testing for
200 cycles while maintaining the low irreversible capacity loss of
2.9% after 500 cycles [512]. However, dead weight of the electrolyte
(12 mL/mgsulfur) can have a negative impact over high energy densi-
ties at cell level.

PBeyond electrodes and electrolytes, the current collectors can
have a significant impact over the cyclic stability. Peng et al. carried
out a comparative performance analysis of lithium sulfur batteries
for different current collectors such as 2D Al, 2D graphene film, and
3D CNTs with high sulfur loading ( > 3.7 mA h/cm2) [513]. Among all
current collectors, 3D CNT current collectors offered the best electro-
chemical corrosion resistivity to support high areal capacity (»280%
enhancement than graphene film) and best cycling performance
(very low (0.029%) decay rate upon 950 cycles). From a commerciali-
zation point of view, the lithium metal anodes are subject to several
limitations in terms of (i) their unstable nature in liquid electrolytes
and (ii) the safety issues associated with the formation of lithium
dendrite [514].

PIn recent years, lithium air batteries have also become more
attractive option for energy storage applications because of their

Plarge theoretical gravimetric energy of 3505 Wh/kg [515]. How-
ever, there are several challenges in their commercialization
such as low rate capability, low round trip efficiency, electrolyte
instability, and poor cycle life [516]. CNTs have been incorpo-
rated in lithium air batteries as cathode catalysts for oxygen evo-
lution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The
addition of carbonaceous materials exhibited a good catalytic
activity for ORR but poor catalytic activity for OER, mainly due
to the charge overpotential caused by sluggish charge transfer
kinetics. Noble metal and MeOx (such as Pt, Pd, Ru, and Au) can
offer significant reduction in charge overpotential, significantly
contributing to the enhancement of round trip efficiency. Jian
et al. utilized the good catalytic activity of Ru and RuO2 towards
both ORR and OER, in order to fabricate CNT-based composite
cathode [517]. The CNT@RuO2 composite cathode offered a good
round trip efficiency of 79% (at 100 mA/g), high rate perfor-
mance, and decent cyclic performance (i.e., approximately no
change in charge and discharge potentials over 20 cycles along
with a stable capacity, 500 mA h/g). The metal oxide layers
helped in preventing the direct contact between the CNTs and
discharge product
(Li2O2). The charge overpotential can be
reduced to 0.3 V by tuning the surface electron state of CNT cath-
ode materials for optimizing morphology and for the even distri-
bution of discharge product [518]. However, there is a long way
to go for the commercialization of lithium air batteries. Beyond
CNT cathode materials, more research efforts are needed for the
development of highly stable electrolytes and effective bifunc-
tional catalysts.

5. Challenges and future opportunities

PIn energy conversion and storage field, CNTs are intensively
investigated in laboratory, ranging from their synthesis to device
fabrication. The future perspectives of energy conversion and stor-
age devices demand optical transparency, flexibility, stretchability,
mechanical wearability, and stable packaging to compete with exist-
ing markets. Undoubtedly, CNTs hold significant potential for being
a robust material to address all these challenges, and energy-related
issues, as discussed in above sections [519]. The controlled synthesis
of CNTs is one of the most critical parameter that limit their wide-
spread use in diverse application fields. To date, numerous reports
have been reported relating to physical/chemical methods-based
synthesis of CNTs [520(cid:1)522]. Likewise, market commercialization of
CNTs into industrial-scale solutions remains a key issue which
requires new approaches for testing and regulation of the products
to close the gap between lab-scale research and commercial applica-
tions. The intensive rational efforts by the union of academia and
industry can lead to a revolution of green energy through utilization
of CNT-based composite materials. Here, the major challenges of
CNTs in terms of their production cost, and thermodynamic and
chemical stability are discussed in following sections.

5.1. Production cost perspectives of CNTs

POver the past few years, a considerable variation has been
reported in the production cost of CNTs due to their rapidly increas-
ing diverse field applications [523,524]. The large scale production
of CNTs is limited by several factors such as cost, quality, purity, uni-
formity, and production yield. The different techniques utilized for
production of CNTs include arc discharge, CVD, laser ablation, elec-
trolysis, pyrolysis, flame synthesis, electron or ion beam irradiation
etc. These methods show large differences in terms of (i) obtainable
space-time yield, (ii) carbon purity, and (iii) amorphous carbon con-
tent [525]. For instance, laser ablation and arc discharge methods
are relatively expensive in terms of CNT production on the gram
scale [526], whereas CVD method provides large production yield at
lowest prices; although CVD-produced CNTs have more imperfec-
tions in comparison to other synthesis methods [527].

POver the past decade, the price of MWCNTs have been decreased
from US $45,000 to $100 /kg of industrial grade CNTs (90% purity)
with annual production of several tons using conventional CVD or
electrospun synthesis methods [528]. Carbon arc welding technique
is one of the innovative synthesis technique that does not require
the use of any metal catalyst. Using this technique, the obtained pro-
duction yield was about 50% of CNTs having size variations along
with an estimated production cost of $50/g purified SWCNTs [529].
The new breakthrough in CNT production was done through hori-
zontally oriented rotary reactor system that provided a high carbon
deposition rate of 130 g CNTs/h, and 3 kg/day with a high production
yield of 446.4% [530]. This environmental friendly method was pro-
jected to reduce the production cost of CNTs from US $100(cid:1)$700 /g
to US $15(cid:1)$35 /g [531]. Thus, there are bright future expectations
for CNTs market in energy-related applications that demand further
expansion of the market opportunities. The manufacturers can plan
for scaling up of the current CNTs production (100 g/day) to the lev-
els of tones per day through a detailed design process.

5.2. Thermodynamic and chemical stability of CNTs

PBeyond mechanical stabilities and thermo-electrical properties,
heat capacity as well as other thermodynamic functionality of CNTs
possess significance importance in several areas of physics, chemis-
try, and chemical engineering. In CVD growth, the effect of growth
conditions and metal interaction is less dominant to the formation
of the CNTs in comparison to thermodynamic control over the

Pgrowth process [532]. CNTs (SWCNTs of 20(cid:1)40 nm in diameter, and
MWCNTs of 30(cid:1)60 nm in diameter) have been found stable over the
temperature range of 25(cid:1)600 °C [533]. The H2O2 oxidation of
MWCNTs have a significant effect on their morphologies and struc-
ture [534]. This effect is ensured by the formation of several func-
tional groups (i.e., carboxylic, hydroxyl, and carbonyl) on the surface
of MWCNTs.

PThe stability of MWCNTs against oxidation can be enriched by
B2O3 or P2O5 passivation, and high temperature treatment [534]. In
CNTs, the molar heat capacity was calculated with respect to ther-
modynamic temperature and three different cases have been
observed such as (i) case I (T 〈 275 K): greater molar heat capacities
of SWCNTs than that of MWCNTs; (ii) case II (T = 275 K): equal molar
heat capacities of SWCNTs and MWCNTs (e.g., 5.64 J K¡1 mol¡1); and
(iii) case III (T 〉 275 K): smaller molar heat capacities of SWCNTs
than that of MWCNTs [535]. The increment in heat capacities of
CNTs have been reported with shortening the nanotube length, pro-
vided with CNT diameter in range of 60(cid:1)100 nm; whereas thermal
stabilities increase with the increase in nanotube length [536]. The
intrinsic thermodynamic stability of CNT lattice have systematic and
reproducible impact on the distribution of diameters such as high
growth temperatures (980 °C) help in producing the large diameter
(0.86 nm) CNTs with few defects, whereas, low temperature growth
(700 °C) causes production of narrow CNTs (0.59 nm) with more
defects [537]. There is a need to maintain a trade-off between small
diameter CNTs and CNTs with low defect densities.

6. Conclusion

PIn this review, we summarized the usefulness of CNTs in diverse
energy-related applications. In addition to the advanced strategies
of CNTs based on novel synthesis methods, recycling of waste mate-
rials is also an efficient, cost-effective, and green alternative for
large-scale production of CNTs. CNTs are advantageous in various
respects (e.g., high flexibility, high transmittance from the UV to
mid-IR spectral region, high surface-to-volume ratio,
favorable
transport properties, good mechanical strength, high aspect ratio,
excellent electrocatalytic activity, and many more). Due to these
extraordinary properties, the potential use of CNTs has been realized
in diverse commercial applications, ranging from PV devices, semi-
conductor devices, displays devices, and sensing applications, by
integrating them into thin-film electronics.

PThe role of CNTs in PV devices, such as TCFs and counter electro-
des (especially in DSSCs), is expected to increase dramatically to
offer low cost alternatives to conventional crystalline-silicon solar
cells. CNT-based TCFs are one of the most promising candidates for
use in emerging flexible, wearable, and stretchable optoelectronics.
They are known to possess good transparent and electrically-con-
ducting properties along with considerable price competitiveness
with existing ITO/FTO TCFs. Thus, CNTs have drawn special attention
for the future development of PV devices due to their extraordinary
optoelectronic properties and strong UV/vis(cid:1)NIR absorption charac-
teristics. CNT-based electrodes can efficiently reduce energy losses
by reducing charge carrier recombination and providing fast charge
transfer kinetics.

PRecently, significant research efforts have been made to modify
the performance of CNT-based electrodes in supercapacitors and
LIBs by developing new and improved synthesis and treatment
methods (e.g., the ball-milling process). In comparison to graphite
anodes, CNT-based anodes exhibit small enhancements in the lith-
ium storage capacity as well as cyclability; unfortunately, the high
irreversible capacity of bare CNT anodes limits their use as a replace-
ment for graphite anodes. However, combining CNTs with other lith-
ium storage compounds, such as metals and inorganic materials (like
silicon), has shown great potential for the performance enhance-
ment of LIBs in terms of specific capacity, stability, and long cycle
