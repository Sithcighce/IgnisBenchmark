The increasing levels of sewage sludge production demands research and development to introduce more 
commercially feasible options for reducing socio-economic and environmental problems associated with 
its current treatment. Sewage sludge may be processed to produce useful products or as a feedstock for 
energy generation. Initially, the characteristics of sewage sludge are discussed in terms of composition 
and the current options for its treatment with the associated environmental impacts. Processes to val- 
orize sewage sludge are discussed, including heavy metal removal from sewage sludge, production of 
bio-char, production and use of activated carbon and use of sewage sludge combustion ash in cement 
and concrete. Thermochemical processes i.e., pyrolysis, co-pyrolysis and catalytic pyrolysis, also gasiﬁca- 
tion and combustion for process intensiﬁcation, energy and resource recovery from sewage sludge are 
then critically reviewed in detail. The pyrolysis of sewage sludge to produce a bio-oil is covered in rela- 
tion to product bio-oil composition, reactor type and the use of catalysts. Gasiﬁcation of sewage sludge 
focusses on the characteristics of the different available reactor types and the inﬂuence of a range of pro- 
cess parameters and catalysts on gas yield and composition. The selection and design of catalysts are of 
vital importance to enhance the selectivity of the selected thermochemical pyrolysis or gasiﬁcation pro- 
cess. The catalysts used for sewage sludge treatment need more research to enable selectivity towards 
the targeted desired end-products along with optimization of parametric conditions and development of 
innovative reactor technologies. The combustion of sewage sludge is reviewed in terms of reactor tech- 
nologies, ﬂue gas cleaning systems and pollutant emissions. In addition, reactor technologies in terms of 
technological strength and market competitiveness with the particular application to sewage sludge are 
compared for the ﬁrst time for thermochemical conversion. A critical comparison is made of the drying 
techniques, co-feedstocks and catalytic processes, reaction kinetics, reactor technologies, operating condi- 
tions to be optimized, removal of impurities, fuel properties, their constraints and required improvements.

1. Introduction 

Sewage sludge is the by-product from the treatment of waste 
water  and  has  the  potential  to  be  used  for  generating  heat  and 
power  [1] .  There  is  interest  in  the  development  of  alternative 
routes  to  treat  and  dispose  of  sewage  sludge  driven  by  socio- 
economic  and  environmental  concerns  [2] .  In  addition,  sewage 
sludge contains many organic and inorganic noxious  compounds 
for  which  a  sustainable  treatment  solution  needs  to  be  found 
[3] . It is estimated that about 50% of the costs for the operation of 

secondary sewage sludge treatment plants in Europe is directly as- 
sociated  with  handling  and  disposal  [4] .  Sewage  sludge  derived 
from the treatment plant contains a high content of moisture, and 
thereby  the  volume  and  tonnages  requiring  treatment  are  large, 
for example, the annual wet sewage sludge production in the USA, 
China and Europe was estimated as 240 MT (2010) [5] . The collec- 
tive generation of sewage sludge in China had a growth rate of 13% 
from 2007–2013, with 6.25 MT of dry solids in 2013 of which only 
25% was appropriately treated. In 2017, the global sewage sludge

production rate was recorded as 45 dry MT per year [1 , 6–8] . In 
2015, ﬁve EU countries (Germany, United Kingdom, France, Spain 
and Italy) were reported to produce 75% of the total sewage sludge 
in Europe [4] . In the same year, annual sewage sludge production 
in China and Taiwan was recorded as 30–40 MT and 77,0 0 0 T, re- 
spectively  [8 , 9] .  Fig.  1  illustrates  the  total  production  of  sewage 
sludge in different countries. The magnitude of sludge production 
has stimulated the search for new and alternative treatment op- 
tions. 

Sewage sludge poses major issues for its usage in many applica- 
tions as it contains a very high moisture content at almost 98 wt.%. 
Generally, moisture content lower than 60% is desired before dis- 
posing through landﬁll, agriculture applications etc. but for ther- 
mal processing, below 15% is required [10] . Different drying oper- 
ations are essentially contingent on the moisture level and opera- 
tional costs before use in thermochemical processes. The different 
options for drying are natural drying, mechanical drying, thermal 
drying and bio drying [11] . Natural drying can be through for ex- 
ample,  using  solar  energy  to  reduce  moisture,  while  mechanical 
drying may not reduce the moisture content as much as thermal 
drying. Bio drying is similar to the composting process which may 
take many days to lower the moisture content. The second most 
important characteristic of sewage sludge is its high heavy metal 
content. The trace elements in sewage sludge in different regions 
are  shown  in  Fig.  2 .  However,  beneﬁcially,  sewage  sludge  is  en- 
riched in nitrogen and phosphorus which act as fertilizer in land 
applications and agriculture [12 , 13] . Based upon the moisture level, 
contaminant  level  and  socio-economic  factors,  U.S.,  China,  Japan 
and EU countries have identiﬁed potential usage of sewage sludge 
in land applications, building materials, anaerobic digestion and in- 
cineration ( Fig. 3 ). However, a signiﬁcant amount of sewage sludge 
may also be disposed of by improper dumping ( Fig. 3 ). It has been 
reported that the process routes for the treatment and disposal of 
sewage sludge in different countries are closely linked to their eco- 
nomic development [14] . 

Thermochemical conversion technologies such as pyrolysis and 
gasiﬁcation  have  been  suggested  as  replacements  for  sewage 
sludge  energy  recovery  rather  than  the  current  most  used  op- 
tions [19] . Each thermochemical process has its own technologi- 
cal and socio-economic merits and demerits which are discussed 
in Sections 4 to 6 of this manuscript. Although thermo-chemical 
conversion involves complex equipment or processes, compared to 
other treatment processes, they may exhibit better economic per- 
formance, higher eﬃciency and greater volume reduction. A recent 
detailed comparison of the merits and de-merits of different pro-

cesses, operational costs and operating conditions of microbiolog- 
ical  methods  and  thermochemical  methods  has  been  made  [18] . 
It was concluded that anaerobic digestion requires a solids reten- 
tion  time  of  several  days,  a  large  space  requirement  for  the  di- 
gesters, low variety of products and supplementary capital invest- 
ment compared with thermochemical processes [18] . There is cur- 
rent interest in sewage sludge management in relation to the top- 
ics of process intensiﬁcation, sludge contaminants, resource recov- 
ery, innovative treatment processes and costs [20] . In several ther- 
mochemical  treatment  processes,  many  researchers  have  investi- 
gated the use of a variety of catalysts to intensify the process and 
to produce end-products having higher value.

Pyrolysis is advantageous for the decomposition of organic pol- 
lutants, neutralization of pathogens, and reduction of the volume 
of the waste. The resultant products derived from sewage sludge 
pyrolysis are light gases containing H 
4 , bio-oil, 
and  char.  [21] .  The  generation  of  bio-oil  and  char  is  reliant  on 
moisture content and ash content of the feedstock, operating con- 
ditions, catalyst and the reactor type to be used. Gasiﬁcation is a 
thermochemical process for the production of syngas and also as 
2 production. The main product from gasi- 
a promising route for H 
ﬁcation is syngas comprising of CO and H 
2 , but may also contain, 
CH 
2 O and also tar as a by-product. The tar that evolves dur- 
ing the gasiﬁcation process results in many problems for the end- 
use of the product gas such as blockage of down-stream pipelines, 
valves and fuel injector nozzles, that are needed to be solved to 
allow  viable  development  of  the  gasiﬁcation  process  [22] .  Simi- 
larly,  direct  combustion  and  co-combustion  of  sewage  sludge  is 
also developing in many countries which is associated with a neg- 
ative environmental impact compared with pyrolysis and gasiﬁca- 
tion. Recently, researchers have also worked on processing of the 
wet sewage sludge directly through hydrothermal treatment, su- 
percritical water gasiﬁcation (SCWG) and the use of plasma reac- 
tors.  For  dewatering  and  generating  energy  from  sewage  sludge, 
hydrothermal treatment has been reported to be eﬃcient [23] . Hy- 
drothermal treatment consists of carbonization and liquefaction at 
elevated  pressure  in  which  water  acts  both  as  a  reactant  and  a 
solvent [24] . The costs involved for hydrothermal treatment tend 
to be higher than pyrolysis due to the higher pressures involved. 
Fig. 4 represents an overview of sludge production and thermo- 
chemical processes which can be used for energy recovery. 

There  have  been  several  reviews  on  the  pyrolysis  of  sewage 
sludge, for example, Fonts et al. [25] have presented a detailed re- 
view on pyrolysis of sewage sludge for liquid production, Hassan 
et al. [26] and Manara et al. [27] have also presented overviews 
of  the  thermochemical  conversion  of  sewage  sludge.  They  have 
discussed  non-catalytic  pyrolysis,  gasiﬁcation  and  combustion  of 
sewage sludge. Therefore, to advance the ﬁeld of research a com- 
prehensive  and  critical  review  on  the  catalytic  thermochemical

conversion with respect to the characteristics of sewage sludge is 
required. Thermochemical processes for the treatment of sewage 
sludge can be enhanced by the use of catalysts in terms of selec- 
tivity of the higher value end-product and process eﬃciencies, en- 
suring the most suitable catalyst is used and with an appropriate 
reactor system. In this review, the inﬂuence of the different char- 
acteristics of sewage sludge on the catalytic process, the range of 
catalysts used and their effects on product yield and composition 
and process eﬃciency are discussed. In addition, the important fac- 
tors of technological strength and market competitiveness of reac- 
tor technologies are presented. 

Therefore, the domain of this paper includes; drying processes 
to  reduce  the  moisture  of  sewage  sludge,  regulations  in  differ- 
ent countries regarding pollutants and heavy metals, and catalytic 
thermochemical  processes  for  energy  recovery.  A  comprehensive 
comparison  of  pyrolysis,  co-pyrolysis  and  catalytic  pyrolysis  and 
gasiﬁcation, co-gasiﬁcation and catalytic gasiﬁcation is presented 
in order to identify issues for such enhanced processes, energy and 
resource recovery. Utilization of char and ash derived from sewage 
sludge  is  discussed  in  applications  such  as  adsorbents,  catalysts, 
building materials and agriculture. An emphasis is placed on re- 
viewing the role of catalysts and combinations of different cata- 
lysts with their promotors, supports, catalytic activity, selectivity, 

coke deposition and deactivation problems related to the produced 
end-products by considering the inﬂuence of sewage sludge prop- 
erties such as high ash content on product yield and composition. 
A comparison of the previous research and reported conclusions 
have been reviewed in regard to modern technological advance- 
ments, which are necessary to identify challenges and limitations 
towards their development for processing sewage sludge. 

2. Characteristics of sewage sludge 

2.1. High moisture content 

There are different categories of sewage sludge which includes 
primary, waste activated and digested sludge that can be converted 
into  useful  energy  [28] .  In  water  treatment  plants,  the  puriﬁed 
water  is  separated  out  leaving  the  sewage  sludge  which  resem- 
bles a slurry containing a signiﬁcant content of water. Before using 
the  sewage  sludge,  either  for  disposal  or  recovering  energy,  this 
moisture content has to be reduced to minimum levels using sev- 
eral available drying technique options. There are different types 
of drying methods for solid waste which includes sewage sludge. 
These drying methods include bio drying, thermal drying (fry dry- 
ing and traditional air drying), and mechanical dewatering. Ther-

mal dryers are tray, pneumatic, rotary, tunnel and cyclone dryers. 
While for mechanical dewatering, ﬁlter presses such as belt and 
vacuum methods are common [11 , 29] . In terms of co-processing, 
many  other  feed  stocks  such  as  straws,  wastes  from  cotton  and 
wood or pre-dried feed stocks are also commonly added as bulking 
agents for drying of sewage sludge. Bio drying is also being used 
for sewage sludge in which bacteria and fungi are involved for wa- 
ter removal. The important parameters are initial moisture content, 
ﬂow rate of air, total time of process and temperature. Neverthe- 
less, there are drawbacks in such processes as it may take several 
days for drying, and the degree of moisture removal is lower com- 
pared to thermal drying [30 , 31] . Pressurized electro-osmotic dewa- 
tering coupled with bio drying can reduce moisture content from 
83% to 60% in a matter of minutes under optimal processing con- 
ditions [32] . A dewatering process involving propane hydrate for- 
mation for drying of sewage sludge has been reported and shown 
to require less energy than mechanical or thermal drying processes 
and can reduce moisture content by up to ~43%, however this may 
take several hours of operation [33] . Pathogens in sewage sludge 
can be reduced using drying processes based on drum drying, ag- 
itated  conductive  drying,  solar  drying,  and  fry-drying  [34] .  Dry- 
ing  through  the  use  of  natural  solar  energy  is  effective  for  dry- 
ing sewage sludge but can involve several days of exposure and 

is dependent on weather conditions. Also, closed solar drying has 
been shown to be more eﬃcient than open solar drying [35] . If 
the purpose of using sewage sludge is to produce energy and fu- 
els, thermal drying is the optimal method [11] . It is evident that 
thermal drying is useful for not only reducing harmful bacteria and 
other toxic contaminants but is also effective in terms of a higher 
drying rate. During continuous thermal drying, nitrogen might be 
released at temperatures under 160–200 °C, this nitrogen can be 
recovered for production of fertilizer [36] . The important factor to 
consider is the cost of the drying operation for water removal ef- 
ﬁciency through mass and energy balances which can indicate the 
viability of the drying process. Before using sewage sludge in ther- 
mochemical processes, conditioners or additives such as CaO are 
also  commonly  used  and  are  effective  for  drying  and  condition- 
ing. A comparison of various different drying techniques is given 
in Table 1 . 

2.2. Heavy metal and organic pollutant content 

The presence of heavy metals and other hazardous organic pol- 
lutant  compounds  in  sewage  sludge  are  key  challenges  for  their 
utilization. Municipal and industrial wastewater is treated to erad- 
icate  the  toxins  produced  by  municipal  and  industrial  accumu-

lation  [39]  but  sewage  sludge  remains  contaminated  by  a  wide 
range  of  organic  micro  pollutants  [40] .  Sewage  sludge  is  a  mul- 
tifarious  amalgam  of  microorganisms,  undigested  organic  mate- 
rial  like  paper,  plant  residues,  oils,  or  fecal  material,  in-organic 
constituents  and  water.  There  is  serious  concern  as  to  the  im- 
pact on human health and the environment arising from the haz- 
ardous  constituents  found  in  sewage  sludge  i.e.,  CPs  [41] ,  PAHs, 
PCB,  PFCs,  PCPs,  PhCs,  benzotriazoles,  PFAS,  nanoparticles,  pesti- 
cides and surfactants [15 , 42–51] . PFAS arise from many industrial 
processes  which  include  metal  plating,  paints  and  coatings,  ﬁre- 
ﬁghting foams, textile and leather production. PFAS mainly consist 
of PFOA and PFOS [52–57] . PFAS are a serious hazard to human 
health and ecological life. The traces of PFAS can also be found in 
the char derived from the pyrolysis of sewage sludge. Many coun- 
tries have also introduced regulations to control these deleterious 
compounds. The undigested organic constituents consist of an ex- 
ceedingly complex mixture of fragments obtained from proteins, 
peptides, lipids, polysaccharides, plant macromolecules with phe- 
nolic structures or aliphatic structures along with organic toxins 
[58 , 59] . In the U.S., alkyl-phenol ethoxylates are extensively used 
as surfactants in commercial and industrial products, which have 
toxic effects when used in land application [60] . Most of the liter- 
ature related to the impact of sewage sludge on the environment 
is focused on a selected number of compounds or family of com- 
pounds. Some researchers have comprehensively reviewed the key 
extraction techniques, cleaning procedures and instrumental tech- 
niques used for the identiﬁcation of emerging toxins [61 , 62] . Thus, 
before deploying sewage sludge to landﬁll or in agriculture, a de- 
tailed  analysis  of  such  emerging  contaminants  contained  in  the 
sewage  sludge  needs  to  be  carried  out.  However,  few  countries 
have very strict regulations with described limit values for these 
pollutants.  Table  2  represents  the  characteristics  of  raw  sludge 
from waste water treatment plants and shows that concentrations 

of different pollutants varies from primary to secondary sludge and 
contains  nitrogen,  phosphorous,  proteins,  fats,  organic  acids,  sil- 
ica and iron. The contaminants of nitrogen and phosphorous can 
be recovered from sewage sludge through chemical and biological 
treatment and used as nutrients in agricultural applications. 

It has been shown that there is signiﬁcant energy content in 
the sewage sludge solids with the reported heating values of raw 
sludge and activated sludge at 23–29 MJ/kg and 16–23 MJ/kg re- 
spectively [63] . These statistics of primary and secondary sewage 
sludge suggests that, products with suﬃcient energy can be gen- 
erated. Table 3 illustrates the proximate and ultimate analyses of 
sewage sludge, which shows that sewage sludge has a consider- 
able amount of volatile matter and carbon content. However, high 
ash content can create problems for product and process eﬃciency. 
The oxygen content is typically between 19–31 wt.% which can af- 
fect the quality of the products, especially, during bio-oil produc- 
tion from sewage sludge where high oxygen and ash content may 
deteriorate its heating value. 

Sewage sludge contains signiﬁcant quantities of heavy metals, 
for  example,  zinc,  copper,  chromium,  nickel,  lead  and  cadmium 
[15] .  Heavy  metal  chemical  species  distribution  can  be  changed 
during the sewage treatment process of conditioning and may lead 
to immobilization of some heavy metals such as Pb [64] . To miti- 
gate the effects of heavy metals in sewage sludge, the addition of 
lignocellulosic biomass is commonly used to produce bio fuels and 
bio materials [65] . Sewage sludge combustion at low temperature 
has been shown to transform the heavy metals like Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, 
and Zn to a stable form and could decrease the leaching of heavy 
metals, for example, leaching of Cr and Cu have been decreased by 
97.56% and 98.52% [66 , 67] . Table 4 shows the limit values of dif- 
ferent heavy metals in Europe to restrict their associated hazard 
in soil and land applications. Many studies based upon eco toxi- 
cological evaluations have been performed which suggest that its

application to land may lead to deterioration in soil quality and 
reduced plant growth [68] . However, the char produced during py- 
rolysis of sewage sludge has been shown to have positive results 
in  regard  to  copper  adsorption  [69] .  Moreover,  due  to  the  wide 
variety of industrial processes feeding into the wastewater treat- 
ment plant, sewage sludge may contain signiﬁcant concentrations 
of toxic heavy metals and organic micro-pollutants. The most toxic 
metals are Hg, Cd, Cu, Zn, Se, Ni, As and Cr. In Table 5 , concen- 
trations of PAHs, PhCs, PFAS are shown, which suggests that dis- 
posal of raw sewage sludge to landﬁll or agricultural land is not 
sustainable and has the potential to create many health problems. 
Hence,  risk  assessments  are  required  before  the  use  of  sewage 
sludge in agriculture or land applications via chemical and biolog- 
ical  scrutiny.  Based  upon  these  risk  assessments and  results  ob- 
tained, sets of regulations have been developed in advanced coun- 
tries. 

3. Thermochemical routes to recover energy from sewage 
sludge 

Sewage sludge is known to contain a signiﬁcant recoverable en- 
ergy content but with the disadvantages of having high moisture, 
ash, heavy metals and organic pollutant contents. The routes to en- 
ergy recovery involve biological and chemical options. The biolog- 
ical means to recover energy from sewage sludge include anaer- 

obic digestion (AD) which has advantages in ﬁnancial terms, but 
may produce an adverse effect on the environment via emission of 
pollutants [88] . Therefore, selecting the most suitable method for 
energy recovery should involve consideration of the various tech- 
nologies, involving environmental and economic beneﬁts in terms 
of resource and energy recovery [89 , 90] . It has been reported that 
the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) for the treatment of sewage 
sludge is TRL 6–7 for gasiﬁcation, TRL 5 for pyrolysis and TRL 6 
for hydrothermal treatment, in terms of commercial viability [20] . 
Sewage sludge needs proper treatment which can not only  mit- 
igate  the  contaminants  and  pollutants  but  also  recover  resource 
and energy. In this regard, thermochemical treatment via pyrolysis, 
gasiﬁcation and combustion have the potential in the longer term 
to be viable considering the cost, quality and wide range of prod- 
ucts that can be produced and the potential of resource recovery. 
Energy recovery from sewage sludge has beneﬁts for improvement 
of environmental impacts by resource diminution [91] . However, 
most of the thermochemical processes especially including the use 
of catalysts are still under development for the production of en- 
ergy from sewage sludge. Some processes are at the demonstration 
phase but few have been implemented successfully. Thermochemi- 
cal treatment is attractive in terms of sludge volume reduction, de- 
struction of harmful bacteria, production of a wide range of prod- 
ucts and importantly signiﬁcant energy recovery. Use of catalysts 
and additives to enhance the quality and quantity of products from 
thermochemical processes is gaining interest and importance. 

4. Pyrolysis of sewage sludge 

4.1. Non-catalytic pyrolysis 

Pyrolysis is deemed as a favorable sludge treatment option be- 
cause it transforms sewage sludge to produce bio-oil, bio-char and 
gas (H 
2 , CO and other light gases) with minimum emission of pol- 
lutants at a low to medium operational temperature range in an 
inert  atmosphere.  Speciﬁcally,  pyrolysis  involves  the  thermal  de- 
composition  of  the  sewage  sludge  solids  at  temperatures  rang- 
ing from 40 0–60 0 °C in a non-oxygen atmosphere (using N 
2 and 
CO 
2 as inert gas) to produce the desired targeted products [25 , 92] . 
The different types of pyrolysis technologies include slow pyroly- 
sis, fast pyrolysis, vacuum pyrolysis, ﬂash pyrolysis and hydro py- 
rolysis.  The  key  important  parameters  that  inﬂuence  the  pyroly- 
sis process are, reactant residence time, temperature, heating rate 
and feedstock size. Pyrolysis has been used to process a large vari- 
ety of feed stocks including, plastics, municipal solid waste, sewage 
sludge, oily sludge and woody biomass. 

4.1.1. Torrefaction and HTC 

Slow pyrolysis has low heating rates and longer residence time, 
and is characterized as carbonization or torrefaction. Generally, car- 
bonization or torrefaction involves low temperatures of less than 
400 °C to reduce the moisture content and increase the density 
and grindability of the torriﬁed char. Slow pyrolysis or carboniza- 
tion results in more char with a lower quantity of bio-oil and gas. 
This solid residue is also called charcoal. The torrefaction process 
not only reduces the mass of sewage sludge but also removes the 
NOx,  SOx  and  other  pollutants  and  improves  the  heating  value 
and C/H ratio of sewage sludge [93 , 94] . The solid torreﬁed sewage 
sludge upon combustion at 900 °C gives signiﬁcant reduction in 
3 (46%) [95] . Also, torreﬁed sewage sludge or biomass can also 
NH 
be used with each other to produce a mainly bio-char product. Im- 
portant factors to consider are mass and energy balances to deter- 
mine the eﬃciency of torrefaction of sewage sludge. Studies have 
shown that the HHV of the torriﬁed char increased up to a temper- 
ature of 270 °C and above that decreased in terms of energy and

more clear picture readers can see the references). 

heavy  metal  content  [104] .  Thus,  torrefaction  and  hydrothermal 
carbonization methods are favorable to produce stabilized bio-char 
for further use in pyrolysis, gasiﬁcation or combustion. 

4.1.2. Fast pyrolysis 

The fast pyrolysis process has been used for the conversion of 
sewage sludge to a bio-oil product. The operational conditions for 
fast pyrolysis are different from slow pyrolysis, the main difference 
is higher heating rate and short residence time with a tempera- 
ture range of 40 0–60 0 °C. Fig. 6 shows that more yield of bio-oil 
is obtained at a pyrolysis temperature of around 570 °C. The prod- 
uct distribution from fast pyrolysis shows a higher yield of bio-oil 
rather than char and gas. 

4.1.2.1. Bio-oil  properties.  Fast  pyrolysis  has  been  studied  by  sev- 
eral researchers with the aim of producing bio-oil. Bio-oil produced 
from pyrolysis of sewage sludge consists of hydrocarbons, organic 
acids and carbonyl compounds of high molecular weight, phenols, 
ketones, aromatic and aliphatic compounds, alcohols, acetic acid, 
nitrogenous  compounds,  sulfur  compounds  and  water  as  shown 
in  Table  6  [27 , 75 , 105–107] .  Table  7  presents  the  characteristics 
of sewage sludge pyrolytic oil in comparison with petroleum de- 
rived  heavy  fuel  oil.  The  bio-oil  has  more  moisture  than  heavy 
fuel oil due to the presence of oxygenated compounds which lead 
to two phases, light and rich organic oil. The light organic phase 
has mainly water and the heavy phase is rich in benzene, toluene, 
styrene,  naphthalene  and  phenol  etc.  [108] .  The  average  HHV  is 
around 30 MJ/kg which is less than the HHV of petroleum fuel oil 
40 MJ/kg. The presence of initial water content and decomposition 
of volatile matter during the pyrolysis results in low heating value 
and oxygenated compounds in the product bio-oil. The commer- 
cial use of this bio-oil is in heating and combustion, however its 
low HHV is a constraint in this process. The properties of bio-oil 
can be enhanced by using co-pyrolysis and by use of suitable cat- 
alysts. To increase the C/H ratio and to decrease the oxygen level 
in the bio-oil many studies have been carried out with variation in 
results. 

4.1.2.2. Bio-char as an adsorbent.  The char obtained from the fast 
pyrolysis  process  contains  carbonaceous  material  and  has  been

25 MJ/kg, 270 °C: 28 MJ/kg and 320 °C: 25 MJ/kg is found in [93 , 94] and [95] , 
while [96] studied up-to 600 °C and gave a clear idea for HHV, mass and energy 
yields, ash and volatile matter). 

mass yields as the process temperature was increased [96] . More- 
over, volatile content of the char decreased slowly with an increase 
in ash content as shown in Fig. 5 (a) and (b). When this residue is 
used in pyrolysis, co-pyrolysis or gasiﬁcation processes the energy 
content of the product oil may increase with lowered oxygen and 
higher  heating  value.  For  example,  a  three  stage  process  can  be 
used, ﬁrst torrefaction, followed by pyrolysis and then gasiﬁcation 
to produce high quality bio-oil, char and gas [97] . 

Another  thermochemical  process  to  produce  bio-char  is  hy- 
drothermal carbonization (HTC). The solid residue left is also called 
hydro char. This treatment is beneﬁcial for wet sewage sludge hav- 
ing  70–80%  moisture  content  to  produce  hydro  char,  liquid  and 
a  nominal amount  of  CO 
2  under  the  temperature range of  180–
250 °C in a closed vessel under pressure [23 , 24 , 98–102] . For wet 
sewage sludge, microwave pyrolysis is also common but reported 
to be not effective [103] . If the moisture content in sewage sludge 
is not removed properly, then during the thermochemical process 
most of the energy would be used in removing water. The spe- 
ciﬁc  heating  value  of  char  obtained  by  hydrothermal  carboniza- 
tion  may  be  less  than  pyrolysis  char.  HTC  is  an  interesting  op- 
tion  for  prior  treatment  before  pyrolysis  because  it  reduces  the

used as adsorbent due to having high surface area or as further 
use in gasiﬁcation processes to produce syngas and chemicals. The 
heating value of the chars depends mainly on the feedstock and 
the values may vary from 11–15 MJ/kg. However, pH, ash, speciﬁc 
surface area and heavy metal content may increase at higher py- 
rolysis  temperatures  and  heating  rates  [116–118] .  Sewage  sludge 
has  been  investigated  for  the  production  of  char  by  the  pyroly- 
sis process or physical and chemical activation of sewage sludge 
to  produce  activated  carbons.  The  activated  carbons  may  have  a 
high  surface  area  and  low  ash  content.  The  surface  area  can  be 
increased by KOH activation to produce activated carbons of sur- 
face area up to 1800 m 2 /g. As the major part of the sewage sludge 
is composed of carbonaceous materials containing different met- 
als,  the  produced  char  from  the  pyrolysis  process  with  modiﬁ- 
cation  may  be  used  as  an  adsorbent  for  pollutants.  It  has  been 
seen that during waste water treatment the dispersed particles set- 
tle  by  gravity  and  the  use  of  agglomerates  or  coagulants  which 
are  mostly  salts  of  iron  and  aluminum.  The  aluminum  and  iron 
hydroxides  of  sewage  sludge  have  an  amorphous  nature  which 
makes an adsorption site for anions. More iron content in sewage 
sludge is useful for waste water treatment from vegetable oil re- 
ﬁning  facilities.  Sewage  sludge  as  an  adsorbent  is  also  effective 
for  the  elimination  of  phosphorus,  hydrogen  sulﬁde,  boron,  ﬂu- 
orides, perchlorate, glyphosate, mercury, arsenate, lead, selenium 
and other micro-pollutants from wastewater [67 , 119–124] . The re-

4.1.2.3. Gases from fast pyrolysis.  The gas produced from the fast 
pyrolysis of sewage sludge consists of light gases including H 
2 , CO, 
CH 
10 . The heating values for bio-oil, char 
and  gas  are  32.2  MJ/kg,  12.2  MJ/kg  and  24.7  MJ/kg  respectively 
from the fast pyrolysis of sewage sludge at 500 °C [126] . The yield 
of gas would be more at higher temperature pyrolysis for example, 
up-to 70 0–80 0 °C. However, as the temperature increases there is 
a chance of increasing NOx, SOx, tars, PAHs and particulate mat- 
ter (PM). PM formation during sewage sludge pyrolysis at differ- 
ent gas residence time and 10 0 0 °C can increase from 1.14 wt.% to 
6.33 wt.% due to mainly large gas ﬂow rates [127] . The pyrolytic 
gases have less heating value at lower to medium pyrolysis tem- 
peratures but they have the potential to be used for heating pur- 
poses. 

4.1.3. Kinetics of pyrolysis for sewage sludge 

Thermogravimetric  analysis  (TGA)  is  the  technique  commonly 
used to understand the decomposition mechanism and to deter- 
mine  the  parameters  of  reaction  kinetics.  Assessments  of  these 
mass losses via TGA can be examined at a constant temperature 
or  heating  rate.  Isothermal  TGA  is  diﬃcult  and  involves  an  ex- 
tensive range of temperatures to determine the mass losses. Non- 
isothermal  TGA  has  the  ﬂexibility  to  accelerate  the  analysis  of 
temperatures. Once the thermal conversion scheme is understood 
via mathematical formulations of the reactions and reactors, then 
it  can  be  applied  to  manufacturing  applications  [128] .  TGA  has 
been largely employed to investigate the thermal degradation char- 
acteristics  of  various  components  such  as  coal  and  biomass  fu- 
els, including animal manure and municipal and industrial sludge 
[128 , 129] . By using the TGA data along with FTIR, an understand- 
ing of the reaction kinetics can be made by using different models. 
The thermal analysis of TG and DTG data has shown that pyrolysis 
of sewage sludge involves multifaceted reaction steps. 

Researchers have reported three stages of weight loss for TGA 
analysis of sewage sludge at different temperature ranges: (a) 180–

Fig. 8.  Weight loss of sewage sludge analyzed on TGA, DSC and DTG [132] . 

200  °C:  The  loss  of  water  absorbed  in  the  sludge  (5–10%),  an 
endothermic reaction. (b) 20 0–60 0 °C: decomposition of volatiles 
(main  component  decomposition  and  maximum  mass  loss  rate 
40–70%), an exothermic reaction. (c) 40 0–70 0 °C: Decomposition 
of  organic  and  inorganic  materials  (9–40%),  an  endothermic  re- 
action  [75 , 130–134] .  Three  mass  loss  stages  at  temperatures  of 
120  °C,  130–492  °C  and  492–720  °C  during  the  TGA  of  sewage 
sludge under pyrolysis conditions are shown in Fig. 8 . The initial 
weight  loss  (5%)  is  related  to  water  removal  which  is  absorbed 
in  sewage  sludge.  The  second  weight  loss  is  66.72%  of  the  total 
weight loss which is related to the loss of organic volatiles lead- 
ing to decomposition of constituents including hydrocarbons (be- 
tween 200–370 °C) and proteins, sugars, aliphatic compounds of 
sewage sludge between 40 0–60 0 °C. These initial two stages are 
also shown by the DTG curve: the ﬁrst mass loss stage at a tem- 
perature of 85 °C and later stages show two major mass loss peaks 
at 276 °C and 333 °C and gradually decreasing in mass until 492 °C. 
The weight loss associated with organic material may continue up 
to temperatures of 600 °C, and between 600–700 °C weight loss of 
inorganic material is observed. Due to the presence of inorganic 
material  for  example,  calcium  carbonate  and  ash  in  the  sewage 
sludge, the weight loss is minor between 60 0–70 0 °C, therefore the 
inorganic mass loss stage has shown almost constant weight loss 
in the DTG curve. Hence, the overall weight loss in this third stage 
is 9%. An endothermic process is shown in the DSC curve which is 
due to the poly-condensation of C –C bonds and C –O bonds occur- 
ring in this temperature range [132] . Thus, the major weight loss 
is between 20 0–60 0 °C and activation energies are reported over 
the range of 125–756 kJ/mol for industrial sewage sludge samples 
[130] . 

Different  models  have  been  used  to  calculate  the  activation 
energy and pre-exponential factor through differentiation and in- 
tegration  for  example,  the  Coats  Redfern  model,  Doyle  equation, 
Ozawa equation and Freeman-Carroll equation. However, the Coats 
Redfern approach is reported as the most extensively used model 
for sewage sludge pyrolysis for the calculation of kinetic param- 
eters  [135] .  By  increasing  heating  rate  and  temperature,  activa- 

tion energy would decrease. Likewise, activation energy can also 
be lowered by using a catalyst [131] . The activation energy for the 
catalyzed reaction is on the lower side and for un-catalyzed reac- 
tion is on the higher side, therefore the rate of un-catalyzed re- 
actions can move towards higher temperature. In Table 8 , activa- 
tion energies and frequency factor / pre-exponential factor (to be 
used in the Arrhenius Equation), of different pyrolysis reactions of 
sewage sludge are given in terms of reaction kinetics. As sewage 
sludge is a heterogeneous material and contains different compo- 
nents depending upon the source, it is diﬃcult to determine all the 
reactions that may occur during pyrolysis. Consequently, reported 
results in the literature for kinetic parameters are varied due to 
the differences in sewage sludge composition and also the use of 
different kinetic models. In order to ﬁnd the most suitable model 
for sewage sludge, linear ﬁtting of the reactions and the linear re- 
gression coeﬃcient R 2 need to be known for each model. The most 
suitable model would have a linear regression near to 0.99, how- 
ever R 2  cannot show whether the reaction mechanism is a best 
ﬁt or not. Thus, different models produce different kinetic param- 
eters and it is diﬃcult to state that one model is suitable for all 
the different reaction mechanisms occurring during sewage sludge 
pyrolysis. 

4.1.4. Co-pyrolysis of sewage sludge 

In order to improve the quality and quantity of products from 
the pyrolysis of sewage sludge, addition of other feedstocks to the 
sewage  sludge  via  co-processing  is  an  interesting  approach.  The 
reported  feedstocks  for  co-pyrolysis  with  sewage  sludge  include 
pinewood saw  dust  [138] ,  microalgae [139] , saw  dust  [140] ,  rice 
straw [141–143] , wheat straw [144] , bamboo saw dust [145] , ma- 
nure  [146] ,  hazelnut  shell  [147] ,  cotton  stalk  [147 , 148] ,  oil  shale 
[149] ,  lignite  [150] ,  bagasse  [151] ,  and  wood  waste  [152] .  These 
feed stocks, enhance H 
2 , CO and other gas production, increase the 
surface structure of bio-chars and improve the elimination of oxy- 
genated compounds, water and concentrations of other pollutants 
in the bio-oil. As can be seen from Fig. 9 , biomass like bagasse, 
rice straw, wheat straw, rice straw and hazelnut shell have more

weight loss than sewage sludge in the temperature range of 200–
600 °C, so in this scenario there is more chance of decomposition 
of volatile matter and in turn high oil and gas yields. The types 
of biomass shown in Fig. 9 will have different thermal degradation 
proﬁles which will be linked to their differences in macromolec- 
ular structure. Biomass consists of mainly cellulose, hemicellulose 
and lignin and different types of biomass vary in their content of 
these biopolymers. Each of the biopolymers decompose over differ- 
ent temperature regimes, the ﬁrst to decompose is hemicellulose 
in  the  temperature  range  200–350  °C,  cellulose  decomposes  be- 
tween ranges between 330–450 °C. The low ash content of biomass 
may add improvement in the characteristics of oil and char and re- 
duce the pollutants in sewage sludge. In Fig. 10 , it is shown that 
the concentration of phenols, ketones, amines, aliphatic hydrocar- 
bon and aldehydes are reduced in co-pyrolysis of sewage sludge 
and sawdust while there is an increase in acids and esters. By us- 
ing  manure  as  co-pyrolytic  feedstock,  there  is  a  decrease  in  the 
percentage of phenol, ketone and aldehydes and an increased trend 
is witnessed in acids and aliphatic hydrocarbons. The gases pro- 
duced during co-pyrolysis show a high yield of H 
2 , almost 35% is 
observed during the co-pyrolysis of sewage sludge and saw dust, 
while  more  CO 
2  is  reported  by  using  manure,  wheat  straw  and 
pinewood as shown in Fig. 11 . As sewage sludge has more nitro- 
gen  content  than  coal,  so  NOx  concentrations  may  be  increased 
during the pyrolysis of sewage sludge, however, NOx can be re- 
duced by addition of coal. The higher O/N content in biomass re- 

sults in more NO formation which can be decreased by using high 
blends of sewage sludge. The addition of coal and biomass can also 
enhance the synergistic value of co-pyrolytic chars [153–156] . Bio- 
char produced from the co-pyrolysis add value in terms of speciﬁc 
surface area and HHV. The average HHV of bio-char from sewage 
sludge pyrolysis is 12 MJ/kg while for lignite it is reported to be 
32 MJ/kg with an increased surface area 97.14 m 2 /g as illustrated in 
Table 9 . The results may vary depending upon the operating con- 
ditions such as initial feedstock size, residence time and temper- 
ature and also due to reactor conﬁguration. Thus, co-pyrolysis of 
sewage sludge can add synergistic value to the produced products. 
Hence, it is shown that co-pyrolysis can give encouraging results 
to improve the deoxygenation and heating value of bio-oil, to re- 
duce the nitrogen, sulfur and other pollutants and to enhance the 
heating value and speciﬁc surface area of chars. 

4.2. Catalytic pyrolysis of sewage sludge 

Catalytic  fast  pyrolysis  is  a  combined  process  for  generation 
of liquid fuel which contains high energy content and is able to 
be used for heat, power, biofuels and chemicals. This technology 
has  emerged  as  an  environmentally  sustainable  option  in  terms 
of versatility and high eﬃciency. In comparison with co-pyrolysis, 
the use of catalysts is challenging due to coke formation on the 
catalyst  and  catalyst  regeneration  issues.  However,  many  studies 
have shown that addition of a catalyst or additives can improve

tain these ﬁve objecti ves and thereby to stabilize the storage value 
of  bio-oil.  In  this  regard,  a  limited  range  of  catalysts  have  been 
studied for pyrolysis of sewage sludge. Consequently, the impor- 
tant factors required for catalytic pyrolysis are; (a) use of additive 
or conditioners in a ﬁrst stage to improve the moisture content. (b) 
use of catalyst to reform or crack the volatile vapors from pyroly- 
sis to produce high quality bio-oil and (c) to examine the effect of 
metals supported on zeolites, alumina, metal oxides, sewage sludge 
char and activated carbon to reduce the pollutants.

It is evident that sewage sludge has a high nitrogen and mois-

different  types  of  catalyst/additives,  for  example,  CaO  as  a  con- 
ditioner to reduce water content or mixed with metal oxides in 
combined form to act as a catalyst. However, the energy eﬃciency 
of pyrolysis processes also depends on prior dewatering and dry- 
ing. Metal oxides including, Al 
2 , and ZnO have 
been investigated with sewage sludge pyrolysis. The existence of 
3  and  ZnO  may  create  possibilities  to  prevent  the  degrada- 
Fe 
tion of organic matter in a demineralized sewage sludge sample 
to produce a high amount of solid residues, while Al 
3 , CaO, and 
TiO

ter and to produce more liquid. It is clear that metal oxides stim- 
ulate the preliminary breakdown of the sludge sample. Pyrolysis

tive for the production of a single organic phase instead of two 
phases (organic and aqueous) with enhanced bio-oil properties of 
stability, viscosity, HHV and composition. Furthermore, composite 
catalysts containing alumina can decrease the oxygen content of 
bio-oil by increasing secondary cracking reactions, however high 
alumina content can lead towards aromatization. Active metals can 
be  added  in  to  these  metal  oxide  supports  for  the  reforming  of

volatile  vapors  by  using  Ni/Al 
2 O

from sewage sludge into N 
H 
2 (68 vol.% at 650 °C) [157] . Moreover, Fenton’s reagent and red 
mud as a conditioner have inﬂuence on high temperature pyrolysis 
to improve the H 
2 yield. Fenton’s reagent and CaO also produced 
the same results, nevertheless iron can transform tar into more gas 
whilst CaO leads to more C –OH, C- (O, N) in char. Another advan- 
tage of Fenton’s reagent is the capture of sulfur in char at up to 
97%. Red mud is an alkaline industrial by-product formed in the 
alumina extraction process from bauxite leaching with sodium. Its 
chemical composition includes Fe 
2 O and 
CaO. As sewage sludge has a high level of metallic oxide, Red Mud 
makes a promising catalyst for the pyrolysis of sewage sludge for 
the  production  of  bio-oil.  The  catalytic  effect  of  CaO  is  also  en- 
couraging for the conversion of NOx precursors into N 
2 for sewage 
sludge pyrolysis. Researchers suggested that calcium carbon-nitride

stages, before pyrolysis (as a conditioner), during pyrolysis (in-situ) 
or after the pyrolysis to reform the volatile vapors (ex-situ). The 
properties  of  products  are  varied  by  changing  the  catalyst  type 
to  obtain  diverse  product  distributions  in  altered  operating  con- 
ditions.  In  many  studies,  it  has  been  observed  that  if  the  cata- 
lyst is not used effectively with the optimum operating conditions. 
The  sewage  sludge  would  cause  catalyst  coke  formation,  giving 
only a nominal amount of bio-oil. In relation to sewage sludge, re- 
searchers investigating catalytic pyrolysis have worked not only to 
enhance the bio-oil properties but also to improve hydrogen pro- 
duction and removal of nitrogen, sulfur and chlorine. In order to 
obtain  high  oil  yields,  optimum  reaction  conditions  are  required 
to sustain oil production and reduce bio-oil exposure to the lower 
temperatures that are favorable to the formation of charcoal. Nev- 
ertheless, deactivation of catalyst due to coke formation on active 
sites and catalyst sintering in the case of high temperature pyroly- 
sis is a problem. Fig. 12 illustrates the mechanism for use of cata- 
lyst and coke formation. 

An  analysis  gained  from  different  researchers  concludes  that 
pre-treatments  of  sewage  sludge  before  pyrolysis  can  give  en- 
hanced homogeneity of the bio-oil. The role of a catalyst in py- 
rolysis is to produce a higher quality of the desired product which 
can be either gas, char or bio-oil, but mostly bio-oil is the desired 
product. In the gas phase more hydrogen and carbon oxide yields 
are required with suppression of pollutants especially at high tem- 
perature pyrolysis. The aim of bio-oil upgrading has ﬁve main ob- 
jectives: (1) to increase the carbon and hydrogen yield, (2) to lower 
the oxygen and water content, (3) to increase the quality of bio-oil 
in terms of higher heating value (HHV), (4) to lower the viscosity 
and (5) to reduce the pollutants. Catalytic pyrolysis is used to ob-

move nitrogen from sewage sludge. On the other hand, KCl is ef- 
fective in the reduction of PAHs with a reported reduction from 
15.3 μg/g to 4.23 μg/g at 850 °C as compared to CaO, Na 
3 and 
Fe 
3 [158] . While use of CaO can lead to decrease PAHs in bio- 
3 together results in a slight decrease of oil yield

[159] . FeCl 
3  and lime pretreatment can also better transform the 
thermal degradation proﬁles of sewage sludge pyrolysis in terms 
of  nitrogen  and  phosphorous.  Sewage  sludge  contains  phospho- 
rous which consists of both inorganic and organic elements hav- 
ing orthophosphate mono-esters and di-esters. On addition of CaO 
in sewage sludge, orthophosphate di-esters convert to mono-esters 
and inorganic elements leads to hydroxylapaptite which is a po- 
tential phosphorus source for plants as presented in Fig. 13 . This 
phenomenon is totally dependent on the temperature, at high tem- 
perature organic fractions converted to inorganic fractions having 
more ash content. Consequently, using metal oxides not only help 
to improve the moisture content, synergistic bio-oil and clean gas 
2 but also are promising in effective transformation 
enriched in H 
of nitrogen and phosphorus. Therefore, use of metal oxides to en- 
hance the product properties has been shown, but deactivation of 
the catalyst with high temperature pyrolysis needs more detailed 
study. 

4.2.2. Catalytic effect of zeolites 

Sewage  sludge  contains  proteins  and  in  excess  produces  a 
highly viscous bio-oil during pyrolysis having more oxygen and ni- 
trogen. In this regard, HZSM-5 zeolite has been reported to be ef- 
fective in the catalytic pyrolysis of sewage sludge for the produc- 
tion of hydrocarbons from pyrolysis vapors due to its properties 
of deoxygenation, denitrogenation and selectivity [161–163] . It has 
been shown that, acid pretreatment of sewage sludge is beneﬁcial 
for the removal of ash content and to avoid catalyst deactivation, 
whilst HZMS-5 also helps to promote a bio-oil with a higher con- 
tent of aromatic compounds, deoxygenation of the product bio-oil 
and N 
3 with delayed deactivation of catalyst 
[162 , 164 , 165] . It has been reported that increasing the amount of 
3 in HZMS-5 resulted in lower concentrations of aromatic 
SiO 
compounds  in  the  bio-oil  at  same  operating  conditions.  Another 

2 production from NH 

2 /Al 

2 O 

experiment reported less oil and char yields and higher gas yields 
by using HZMS-5 with SiO 

2 only (no alumina). 

The  catalysis  temperature  and  pyrolysis  temperature  play  an 
equally important role in the formation of aromatic compounds. 
Similarly, use of USY zeolite helps to reduce the activation energy 
and to promote the decomposition of volatile matter for higher oil 
and gas production [131] . HZMS-5 has the capability to break the 
C –C bond especially in nitriles and leads to the production of aro- 
matic compounds and ammonia. HZMS-5 cracks the pyrolytic va- 
pors into intermediates due to having large pore size and a three- 
dimensional  structure.  Addition  of  metals  with  HZMS-5  can  im- 
prove the generation of intermediates to produce clean gas and oil. 
However, addition of metals on HZMS-5 can also decrease the spe- 
ciﬁc surface area and pore volume due to very small particle size. 
So, there should be proper dispersion of metals on supports to ex- 
pose more active sites to reactant vapors and to generate more in- 
termediate products. During catalytic pyrolysis, by using the tran- 
sition  metals  Ni  and  Co  on  HZMS-5,  macromolecules  of  amines 
in sewage sludge might crack in to smaller molecules due to the 
acidic sites present in zeolites and generation of H radicals with 
dehydrogenation,  dehydration  and  deamination.  A  reaction  path- 
way  is  given  in  Fig.  14  for  the  N  transformation.  Ni  and  Co  are 
known for the cleavage of C –C bonds by transforming HCN to NH 
3 . 
The constraint of coke formation on active sites cannot be ignored 
because at high temperature Ni is more prone towards coke for- 
mation. In this regard, other bimetallic combination with zeolites 
can also be studied. The combination of Mo-Co, Mo-Ce, Ni-Mo, Mo- 
Ce, Ni-Ce can also be tested, as researchers have studied these bi- 
metallic catalysts for biomass and other wastes. There is lack of 
detailed studies, based on coke formation and regeneration of cat- 
alysts during the N and P transformation of sewage sludge catalytic 
pyrolysis. 

4.2.3. Catalytic effect of sewage sludge derived char 

Recently,  the  use  of  sewage  sludge  derived  char  has  been 
widely studied, for example, the generation of sewage sludge char 
has shown promising results in the reforming of pyrolytic vapors. 
The sewage sludge characteristics of heavy metal provides enough 
inorganic fractions including Mg, Na, Ca and K to promote the cat- 

14

alytic activity and the char produced at higher temperatures have 
higher surface area and pore volume and in turn higher activity 
to reform the pyrolytic vapors and tars. In order to examine the 
catalytic role of sewage sludge, char has been investigated by re- 
searchers  with  encouraging  results.  Sewage  sludge  char  impreg- 
2  are promis- 
nated with activation agents such as KOH and ZnCl 
ing  for  reducing  NOx,  in  addition,  activated  carbon  can  also  be 
produced.  Comparison  of  char  with  dolomite  and  quartz,  show 
that char has more effective reforming eﬃciency to produce bio- 
oil  with  less  oxygenated  compounds  and  nitriles,  and  improved 
heating value of the product gas [166] . Addition of active metals 

on sewage sludge char gives enhancement in the catalytic activ- 
ity for improved results compared with metal oxides and zeolites 
[167 , 168] . The dispersion of metal on char can augment the sur- 
face area and pore volume but during reforming the ﬁxed carbon 
present  in  the  sewage  sludge  and  hydrocarbon  oil  content  may 
cover the active metal pore sites which leads to coke formation 
and deactivation. This phenomenon is shown in Fig. 15 (a) and (b) 
by SEM images before and after reforming of pyrolytic vapors on 
sewage sludge char and Fe embedded sewage sludge char. There- 
fore, it is most important to know the dispersion of metals towards 
coke  formation  and  the  thermal  stability  of  the  catalyst  support

material. The deoxygenation of bio-oil on Ni, Co, Mo, Zn, Fe, Cu, Cs, 
Mg and noble metal based catalysts with various support materials 
has shown promising results for sewage sludge [169] . A summary 
is presented in Table 10 , to highlight the catalytic effect on oil and 
gas yields, HHV’s and reduction of pollutants for example NOx, SOx 
and PAHs. 

The  use  of  sewage  sludge  char  either  combined  with  active 
metal or not, is suitable for catalytic purposes because it is easy 
to generate, easy to use torreﬁed and carbonized char and most 
importantly it has low cost. Researchers have upgraded the bio- 
oil  from  biomass  via  dehydrogenation  by  using  mono  and  bi- 
metallic  sulﬁde  catalyst  supported  on  zeolites,  metal  oxides  and 
activated  carbons  under  certain  pressure  such  as  ﬂuid  catalytic 
cracking of fossil fuels. However, such kinds of catalysts and pro- 
cesses have not been reported for sewage sludge extensively. The 
reasons  might  include:  (1)  Sewage  sludge  has  high  ash  content 
which is a great limitation for using expensive catalyst combina- 
tions. (2) Due to sewage sludge containing proteins, amines, phos- 
phorous and other pollutants, resource recovery has the same im- 
portance along with producing synergistic products. (3) Prepara- 
tion of metallic catalyst needs calcination and consideration of re- 
generation issues after the reforming process. Due to the high ash 
content of sewage sludge, deactivation of metal catalysts would be 
increased.  Therefore,  a  range  of  catalysts  need  to  be  studied  in 

depth with sewage sludge as the feed stock for enhancement of 
pyrolytic products. 

4.3. Reactors for pyrolysis of sewage sludge 

An important factor for catalytic fast pyrolysis is the type of re- 
actor used for the process which can represent around 10 to 15% 
of the overall cost. The reactors which are being used frequently 
and recommended by many researchers for pyrolysis are ﬁxed bed 
reactors, bubbling ﬂuidized bed reactors, circulating ﬂuidized beds, 
rotating cone reactors, spouted bed reactors, ablative reactors, vac- 
uum reactors and screw or auger reactors [178] . In the context of 
pyrolysis, one reactor is enough to produce the products. Never- 
theless, in catalytic fast pyrolysis a second reactor is required to 
reform or crack the pyrolytic vapors in the presence of the catalyst 
to produce the targeted products. A two-stage ﬁxed bed reactor is 
most suitable for such a kind of pyrolysis. In the two-stage reactor 
system, the ﬁrst stage is used for pyrolysis of the sewage sludge 
generating the pyrolysis vapors and gases which pass directly to 
the second stage containing the catalyst for catalytic reaction. This 
conﬁguration is developed at the laboratory scale but there is no 
example at commercial level. 

The reactors extensively used for thermochemical processing of 
sewage sludge are ﬁxed bed, bubbling ﬂuidized bed, auger reac- 
tor and rotary kiln and also a few have used circulating ﬂuidized

TGA study was conducted to observe the weight 
loss of different metal oxides with sewage sludge. 
Al 2 O 3 and TiO 2 and CaO have shown good results 
to restrict char production. 
It was observed that a slight decrease in oil yield 
but improved organic phase with better HHV, 
stability and viscosity was caused by post 
treatment with catalyst. 
By using composite alumina the highest yield of 
liquid was around 48.44 wt.% and while changing 
the temperatures the yield of products produced 
less aromatics and more aliphatic compounds. 
High yield of H 2 68 vol.%. It was observed that 
improvement was caused by Ni/Al 2 O 3 for bio-oil 
reforming and prevented coke deposition. NOx 
converted to nitrogen and 20% remained in char. 
Hydrogen yield was increased by using 
combination of two conditioners and provision of 
Fe 2 O 3 , CaO. Ca and Fe helped to convert tar into 
more gas. Only Fenton treatment captured the 
sulfur in char up-to 97%. 
Red mud with more Fe 2 O 3 content promoted 
enhancement of the H 2 yield by decreasing the 
tar. Aromatic nitriles, mono aromatics and PAHs 
were 10%, 4.96% and 54% by weight at 700 °C. 
It was found that catalysts have ability to restrict 
PAHs at higher temperature. The concentrations 
in bio-oils were 14, 4, 4 and 8 μg/g with 
non-catalyzed, KCL, Na 2 CO 3 and Fe 2 O 3 . 
HZSM-5 with Si/Al ratio of 25 gave 16.4% yield of 
aromatics and enhanced the transformation of 
nitrogen to NH 3 . HZMS-5 proved to break the C –C 
bonds of amines macro molecules. 
At 550 °C, the highest yield 41.39wt% of bio-oil 
was attained by using ZSM-5 catalyst. HHV’s of 
gas and oil were 22.5 MJ/Nm 3 
and 20.61 MJ/kg. 
Full retrieval of inorganic elements were found in 
the char, which suggests that catalyst deactivation 
maybe lessened through ex-situ catalytic 
pyrolysis. 
Pretreatment with acid or base did not help to 
enhance the bio-oil quality. The gas yield was 
approximately 9–20% and the energy loss was 
less than 10% over the range of sludge types. 
More oil yield was observed in primary sludge 
rather than digested sludge. 
Results showed that activation agent 
impregnation with SS char could be an 
environmentally friendly and energy-saving 
approach for the production of activated char and 
also for De-NOx. 
Increased gas yield: 15.9–35.8wt%, decrease in 
liquid yield: 31.9–10.2wt%, increase in HHV of 
syngas: 12.5–17 MJ/kg and increase in pollutant 
gases.

beds. Circulating ﬂuidized bed reactors are favorable for commer- 
cial usage in catalytic pyrolysis in terms of catalyst regeneration. In 
the case of in-situ catalytic fast pyrolysis, short residence times are 
found, which in the case of ﬂuidized bed reactors, the velocity of 
the carrier gas ﬂow is very critical with respect to sewage sludge 
coming from the inlet, so that an optimum contact time between 
catalyst and sewage sludge particles is produced. To obtain a large 
quantity and quality of bio-oil, the particle size of the feedstock 
is important, where high surface area and good heat transfer are 
favored. Catalyst surface area (support and promoter) also plays a 
vital role. Moreover, in continuous systems the catalyst regenera- 
tion also needs to be considered. The presence of char in the re- 
generator would create a problematic situation, so the contact time 
needs to be optimized. It has also been shown that to obtain op- 
timum heat transfer rates, the use of sand as an inert bed mate- 

rial is preferable. In the case of ex-situ catalytic fast pyrolysis, the 
ﬁrst reactor which is commonly a ﬂuid bed, an auger reactor or 
a rotating cone reactor, are used for the preliminary conversion of 
sewage sludge in to hot pyrolysis vapors. A second reactor is then 
used for the catalyst, which is commonly a ﬁxed bed or circulating 
ﬂuidized bed reactor to upgrade the pyrolysis vapors into bio-oil 
[179] . Consequently, using a two-stage reactor (sewage sludge in 
the ﬁrst stage and catalyst in the second stage) is preferable, al- 
lowing reforming or cracking of the evolved pyrolytic vapors.

ity of pyrolysis reactors for biomass can be well suited for sewage 
sludge,  the  only  difference  being  in  terms  of  feed  stock  charac- 
teristics  which  need  to  be  characterised.  However,  these  quali- 
ties of biomass pyrolysis reactors need to be analyzed before us- 
ing sewage sludge. Speciﬁcally, for sewage sludge Table 11 gives 
an  indication  of  the  properties  of  different  reactors  based  upon 
feed size requirement, gas ﬂow rates, bio-oil yields, heating meth- 
ods, heat transfer rates, scale up capabilities and residence times. 
The Table shows qualitative data for pyrolysis reactors which can 
be described quantitatively to discuss their technological strength 
and  market  competitiveness.  In  bubbling  ﬂuidized  bed  reactors, 
the bio-oil yield is around 75% and can be scaled up to a larger 
scale  easily,  but  they  require  large  ﬂow  rates  of  gas.  Circulating 
ﬂuidized bed reactors can handle almost the same feed size range 
as bubbling ﬂuidized bed reactors, however larger gas ﬂow rates 
would lead to increased complexity and complex systems results 
in  elevated  costs.  Spouted  bed  reactors  are  similar  to  bubbling 
ﬂuidized bed and circulating ﬂuidized bed reactors but having a 
spout shape. The spouted bed geometry produces a cyclic move- 
ment of the bed particle material and enables stable operation over 
a wide range of gas ﬂows. In the case of auger reactors, the feed 
size can be up to 5 mm, which can be handled with low gas ﬂow 
rates and less complexity. These attributes may vary from case to 
case, however several researchers have reported the operational re- 
sults and are shown in Table 11 . 

Saaty et al., Vargas et al. [187 , 188] and Adar et al. [189] have 
elucidated how to use Analytical Hierarchy Processes for decision 
making  and  how  to  show  the  most  important  and  least  impor- 
tant factors quantitatively. Table 12 illustrates the quantitative data 
by using the Analytical Hierarchy Process. The positive attributes 
are shown in a 10–1 scale value and negative attributes which can 
cause hindrance in eﬃciency are displayed from 1–10 scale value. 

High bio-oil yields are favorable, shown as a 10–1 scale value. High 
inert gas ﬂow rates, high complexity and hard to scale up of re- 
actors are depicted from 1–10. Table 13 shows the technological 
strengths for pyrolysis reactors as a sum of all scale values. 

Based  on  these  factors  one  can  decide  on  the  technological 
strength  of  a  reactor,  along  with  scale  up  capabilities  and  with 
cost factors determines whether it is market competitive or not. 
The technological strength is critically important for the optimum 
selection of the reactor type, and if the reactor has more techno- 
logical complexity it would not be attractive to the market. Large 
ﬂow  rates  of  inert  gas  and  very  small  feed  size  are  reasons  for 
high  complexity.  The  bubbling  ﬂuidized  bed  reactor,  circulating 
ﬂuid bed reactor, spouted bed reactor and auger reactor have more 
or less the same bio-oil yields but due to the lower technologi- 
cal complexity of the auger reactor, it has more market compet- 
itiveness as compared to other reactors. Depending upon various 
operating conditions and origin of feedstock, the results may vary 
for different reactors. A graphical illustration of this technological 
strength and market competitiveness is shown in Fig. 16 and a pro- 
cess ﬂow diagram for catalytic fast pyrolysis is illustrated in Fig. 17 
based upon the whole pyrolytic process for sewage sludge. 

4.4. Challenges for pyrolysis of sewage sludge 

Using sewage sludge as a waste material for generation of en- 
ergy and power is an innovative treatment option which has pos- 
itive socio-economic impacts. Despite the fact that sewage sludge 
has potential to produce energy, it is also contaminated with heavy 
metals which can have environmental issues. To cope with such is- 
sues, different technologies depending upon requirements are be- 
ing used. Speciﬁcally, towards pyrolysis of sewage sludge, there are 
a number of challenges to further development: (1) Due to high

3 , SO 

sludge. (5) During production of clean gas and high heating value 
oil, release of pollutants (NH 
2 , HCl, HCN, PM) and their con- 
trol  is  also  challenging.  (6)  Due  to  high  ash  content  of  sewage 
sludge the catalyst might become deactivated because of coke for- 
mation.  (7)  During  deoxygenation,  dehydration  and  denitrogena- 
tion  of  bio-oil,  control  of  reaction  conditions  with  catalysts  and 
reactors  is  challenging  to  obtain  a  quality  end-product.  (8)  The 
biggest  challenge  for  pyrolysis  or  catalytic  pyrolysis  is  to  make 
products readily available for direct commercial use. 

5. Gasiﬁcation of sewage sludge 

Gasiﬁcation  is  a  known  thermochemical  method  to  produce 
syngas.  Syngas  is  mainly  a  mixture  of  hydrogen  and  carbon 
monoxide but may also contain carbon dioxide, methane, tar, water 
and other light hydrocarbons. Torreﬁed sludge, carbonized sludge, 
hydro char, pyrolytic char and direct use of sewage sludge in gasi- 
ﬁcation is generally studied. Recently, co-gasiﬁcation and catalytic 
gasiﬁcation of sewage sludge is also under investigation to produce 
improved quality syngas. Gasiﬁcation reactions can be carried out 
at temperatures greater than 800 °C and with a partial supply of 
oxygen. It is normally operated by using air as a gasifying agent, 
however,  many  studies  have  reported  using  oxygen,  steam,  CO 
2 
and mixture of air-steam, O 
2 as gasifying agents 
in the gasiﬁcation process. Although, gasifying agents play a great 
part in the composition of the ﬁnal syngas product, however due 
to the inherent properties of sewage sludge the product distribu- 
tion and amount of tar and other pollutants may vary substantially. 
In order to understand the gasiﬁcation process, it is important 
to  know  the  reactions  involved.  Gasiﬁcation  is  sub-divided  into 
four  stages  which  are:  (a)  Drying  (b)  Pyrolysis  (c)  Oxidation  (d)

moisture content in sewage sludge, the product quality is not high. 
(2) A high amount of energy is required to decrease the moisture 
content and drying is time consuming while other feeds tocks hav- 
ing less moisture can directly be used. (3) Drying techniques and 
addition of another feed stock or conditioner have been applied 
to increase the product value, however deoxygenation and deni- 
trogenation is challenging (4) To enhance the process and prod- 
uct quality only a limited number of catalysts and reactors have 
been used for pyrolysis so far due to the characteristics of sewage

Reduction  [190 , 191] .  The  drying  zone  is  basically  for  the  reduc- 
tion of moisture level of the sewage sludge and it is normally in 
the temperature range of 70–200 °C reducing the moisture con- 
tent to less than 15%. The pyrolysis zone is for the thermal degra- 
dation of sewage sludge at temperatures between 350–600 °C. In- 
side the oxidation zone, the residual char and volatiles are oxidized 
and due to exothermic reactions, the temperature quickly reaches 
1100  °C.  Finally,  in  the  reduction  zone,  the  char  is  transformed 
into CO and H 
2  by mainly partial oxidation, Boudouard reaction, 
steam gasiﬁcation and hydro-gasiﬁcation. It is observed that, when 
steam is added to the gasiﬁer the oxidation and reduction zone 
temperatures decrease and hydrogen volumetric rate increases. A 
basic gasiﬁcation reaction is presented in Eq. (1) [191] , other basic 
chemical reactions and mechanisms of gasiﬁcation are given be- 
low in Table 14 . Along with the syngas, the pollutant gases from 
sewage sludge may release as gasiﬁcation occurs at higher tem- 
perature. Moreover, the solid ash may contain heavy metals and 
consequently they would affect syngas cleaning from tar and ash. 
To obtain a clean syngas for downstream utilization, several prob- 
lems have been highlighted such as tar formation which can be 
prevented by using optimum operating conditions, co-gasiﬁcation, 
an appropriate catalyst and suitable reactor system, which are dis- 
cussed in the next sections.

5.1. Kinetics of sewage sludge chars during gasiﬁcation 

The reaction kinetics of pyrolysis and gasiﬁcation are not the 
same; pyrolytic kinetic studies consists of more complex steps than 
gasiﬁcation.  In  the  gasiﬁcation  of  sewage  sludge,  char  acts  as  a 
limiting  reactant,  because  it  has  to  react  with  steam  or  carbon 
dioxide which is a slower step than devolatilization and reform- 
ing reactions of the gas phase. As sewage sludge char has more 
surface area due to its catalytic nature, so the reactivity might be 
higher than some other waste feed stocks. Whilst in gasiﬁcation, 
the reactivity is also dependent on other factors such as the gasi- 
fying agent, heating rate, temperature, surface structure of chars, 
catalyst  and  other  feedstock  (if  used).  The  activation  energy  for 
the  Boudouard  reaction  and  water  gas  reactions  is  higher  than 
the  initial  combustion  of  char  as  shown  in  Table  14 .  To  analyze 

the reactivity of char, kinetic parameters i.e., activation energy and 
pre-exponential factor as a function of temperature, heating rate 
and degree of conversion are important to know. Process temper- 
ature  has  a  substantial  effect  on  sewage  sludge  gasiﬁcation.  Re- 
searchers have conducted kinetic studies for sewage sludge to ob- 
serve the char reactivity and conversion under CO 
2 O gasi- 
fying media using TGA at 80 0–90 0 °C [195 , 197] . The char reactivity 
can be conceived as steam reacting more effectively producing hy- 
drogen in the water gas shift reaction rather than CO 
2  as shown 
in  Fig.  18 .  The  char  reactivity  towards  steam  is  higher  at  lower 
temperature and concentrations while conversion with CO 
2 needs 
higher temperature and higher concentration. It has also been seen 
that evolved gas composition is not much affected by the gasify- 
ing media. Based on the data taken from the char conversion, rate 
constants can be calculated for further activation energy and fre- 
quency factor calculations depending upon which kinetic model is 
being used.

5.2. Reactors for gasiﬁcation of sewage sludge 

During the gasiﬁcation process a reactor has vital importance. 
The  reactor  systems  reported  by  researchers  for  gasiﬁcation  of 
sewage sludge are classiﬁed into ﬁxed bed reactors [198 , 199] , ﬂu- 
idized  bed  reactors  [200 , 201] ,  circulating  ﬂuidized  bed  reactors 
[202–204] , rotary kiln [205] , auger and plasma reactors [206 , 207] . 
Furthermore, the method used for injection of the gasifying agent 
into the reactor, for ﬁxed bed reactors deﬁnes the gasiﬁcation type 
as downdraft (cross draft), and updraft (co-current). The feedstock 
composition like moisture and ash content also effects the ﬁnal de- 
sired product produced from the reactor. In the updraft gasiﬁer, the 
sewage sludge is fed from the top of the reactor and air, steam, O 
2 
or a mixture of these gasifying agents is injected from the bottom 
of the reactor. The produced gas exits from the side of the top. 
Studies have shown that, this is less eﬃcient due to contamination 
of the syngas with higher levels of tar. In the downdraft gasiﬁer, 
the  feed  inlet  is  from  the  top  and  the  gasifying  agent  enters  at 
the oxidation zone and the produced gas outlet is at the side of 
the bottom of the reactor. The downdraft gasiﬁer generates good 
quality syngas because it has less contamination of tar. Some dif- 
ﬁculties such as accumulation of slag and pressure drop inside the 
ﬁxed bed reactors have been observed. A schematic diagram of an 
up-draft and down-draft gasiﬁer is shown in Fig. 19 .

Fluidized bed reactors need high ﬂow rates for ﬂuidization of 
sewage sludge particles and results in high throughputs of the ﬁ- 
nal gas products. They have good heat transfer rates and clean gas 
can be produced by passing the product gas through cyclones and 
electrostatic  precipitators  to  extract  sand,  ash  and  unburnt  char 
particles. The ash extraction downstream of the ﬂuidized bed re- 
actors is a problematic situation which produces clinker and ag- 
glomerates and forms an increased bed height due to the high ash 
content of sewage sludge. Circulating ﬂuidized bed reactors enable 
char combustion and regeneration of catalyst (if used). In ﬂuidized 
bed or circulating ﬂuidized bed reactors there is a possibility of 
attrition of fuel particles with the high gas ﬂow rates which ef- 
fect the desired gas quality. Use of high ﬂow rates for ﬂuidization 
causes problems in handling and maintenance of gasiﬁers which 
results in high costs. Therefore, these two reactor conﬁgurations 
have good eﬃciency in terms of solid gas reactions in gasiﬁcation, 
tar removal and syngas quality. In this regard, the two-stage reac- 
tor conﬁguration is used to produce a higher quality syngas cou- 
pled with ash extraction. Researchers have also reported a three 

stage  conﬁguration  to  attach  one  more  reactor  to  the  two-stage 
conﬁguration. The third stage may consist of ﬁxed bed, ﬂuidized 
bed, auger reactor, rotary kiln or plasma reactor for tar removal 
and improved syngas quality. However, this conﬁguration leads to 
added cost. Auger reactors have also been reported with improved 
tar  removal  and  syngas  quality.  Rotary  kilns  have been  reported 
with installation of baﬄes inside the drum and layout at a certain 
angle to avoid ash accumulation and agglomeration. Rotary kilns 
have a lower heat transfer rate due to movement at a particular 
speed and the drawback of ineﬃcient sealing is involved. While 
plasma reactors are promising for wet sewage sludge and removal 
of  pollutant  gases  at  higher  temperatures,  however  they  require 
high input energy which is diﬃcult to justify at commercial scale. 
Moreover, many factors are dependent on the selection of the 
reactor technology to be used for the gasiﬁcation of sewage sludge. 
These factors are temperature, pressure, nature of feed stock, mois- 
ture  content,  particle  feed  size,  feed  rate,  equivalence  ratio  of 
air/sewage sludge, steam to sewage sludge ratio. In addition, if a 
catalyst is being added for tar and syngas reforming then proper

selection of the catalyst is needed, its position within the reactor 
system (in-situ or ex-situ) and its effects on the desired product 
should be known. Each reactor technology has varying results with 
respect to these factors or operating conditions. Using one reactor 
in which gasiﬁcation with the help of steam and catalyst are all 
in one place can be advantageous to save time and cost. This kind 
of conﬁguration is highly recommended. Fock et al. [208] have in- 
vestigated a vortex ﬂow gasiﬁer to decrease the tar content from 
syngas. The design of a vortex ﬂow gasiﬁer consists of one stage 
reactor feeding air and fuel from the top. The air ﬂow is made to 
rotate  horizontally  going  downwards  and  with  a  secondary  ﬂow 
in an upward direction in the middle of the gasiﬁer. This design 
was basically to make the pyrolysis and char combustion in one 
downdraft gasiﬁer in which combustion of volatiles takes place in 
the upward direction due to supply of air. Experiments were car- 
ried out for wood chips at 100 kW capacity, however, there was 
less further detail reported. In an another study for coal gasiﬁca- 
tion, Elliot et al. [209] made changes to the vortex gasiﬁer as input 
of air at various inlets, but further evidence of gasiﬁcation reac- 
tions, char and ash controls and other operating conditions were 
not provided. Thus, these vortex ﬂow gasiﬁers may have potential 
for sewage sludge gasiﬁcation as single stage reactors, but more in 
depth studies are required.

ﬁcation reactors. 

5.2.1. Technological strength and market competitiveness of 
gasiﬁcation reactors 

Based  on  the  properties  of  gasiﬁcation  reactors,  technological 
strength and their market competitiveness can be evaluated. The 

properties of gasiﬁcation reactors can be converted to scale val- 
ues using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), similar to pyrol- 
ysis reactors ( Section 4.3.1 ). Table 15 and Fig. 20 show the scale 
values  for  technological  strength  and  graphical  representation  of 
market competitiveness of gasiﬁcation reactors. The auger reactor 

22

is deemed as more attractive towards market viability according to 
this analysis. The tar reduction attribute is shown as positive and 
ash agglomeration is illustrated as negative. Plasma reactors have 
shown more complexity  requiring a  high input energy prerequi- 
site. Reactors with more ash agglomeration have less technological 
strength and market competitiveness for sewage sludge. A number 
of problems add complexity and in turn more cost for gasiﬁcation 
of sewage sludge. 

5.3. Operating parameters for gasiﬁcation of sewage sludge 

5.3.1. Moisture content, feed size and feed rate 

A dried sewage sludge is required for the production of good 
quality syngas in gasiﬁcation otherwise torreﬁed, pyro char or hy- 
dro  char  having  less  moisture  may  be  required  for  utilization. 
Plasma gasiﬁers have potential to treat the wet sewage sludge and 
produce syngas with reduction in pollutants. A wise selection of 
drying technology and other optimal conditions are indispensable 
for the optimal quality and quantity of the syngas. To obtain a high 
yield of product gas, the feed particle size and the rate at which 
the feed is being fed to the reactor, play an important role. Sen- 
sitivity towards the particle sizes are in order of increasing par- 
ticle size, circulating ﬂuidized bed reactor > bubbling ﬂuidized bed 
reactor > ﬁxed bed reactor. An eﬃcient heat transfer rate leads to 
improved gasiﬁcation reactions resulting in high H 
2 and CO values 
and reduced tar content. A low ﬂow rate of feedstock and higher 
gas residence time would lead to higher char conversion and more 
transformation  of  carbon  content  to  the  gaseous  state.  However, 
at lower gas residence time and high feed ﬂow rate, the reactions 
would not be completed and the desired product losses its quality. 
Optimized feed ﬂow rate and gas residence time are favorable. 

5.3.2. Equivalence ratio 

An  equivalence  ratio  (ER)  is  the  actual  air  to  sewage  sludge 
mass ratio used in gasiﬁcation with respect to the air to sewage 
sludge mass ratio required for stoichiometric combustion. ER has 
a  key  impact  factor  on  the  gasiﬁcation  of  sewage  sludge.  Many 
researchers  have  found  that  at  lower  ER,  hydrogen  and  carbon 
monoxide  content  is  higher,  but  at  a  low  ER  the  gas  products 
would also decrease, similar to the start of pyrolysis. On the con- 
trary, low hydrogen and carbon monoxide and higher carbon diox- 
ide content would be produced at higher ER resulting in low heat 
content of the syngas. It has also been found that due to higher 
ER, more oxygen reacts with volatiles and results in enhanced tar 
cracking.  Too  lower  or  higher  ER  may  lead  to  diﬃculties  in  the 
gasiﬁcation of sewage sludge. Hence, 0.2 to 0.35 is the range of 
equivalence ratio to obtain good results [210–212] . 

5.3.3. Steam/Sewage sludge ratio 

Steam  to  sewage  sludge  ratio  (S/SS)  is  the  amount  of  steam 
being injected with sewage sludge into the reactor. The reactions 
involving  steam  have  vital  importance  in  steam  gasiﬁcation  and 
hydrogen production. Studies have shown that syngas production 
of higher heating value can be generated with lower tar and char 
content by using steam rather than air gasiﬁcation. The S/SS ratio 
is a signiﬁcant factor in steam gasiﬁcation because the steam re- 
forming reaction is the key reaction to produce H 
2 [213] . At lower 
ratio of S/SS, the syngas may have elevated contents of char, tar 
and  methane.  The  elevation  of  S/SS  ratio  from  0  to  2  gives  im- 
proved impact on H 
2 content, char gasiﬁcation, tar reforming and 
dry gas quality. Researchers have found that the generation of hy- 
drogen and carbon monoxide during the gasiﬁcation reaction com- 
pletely relied on the quantity of steam, whereas the CO 
2 and CH 
4 
are controlled by the temperature of reactor [214] . Therefore, the 
optimal S/SS of 0 to 2 has importance in sewage sludge gasiﬁca- 
tion along with other operating conditions. 

5.3.4. Temperature and pressure 

A  major  controlling  process  parameter  for  the  gasiﬁcation  of 
sewage sludge is the temperature, which inﬂuences the comple- 
tion of gasiﬁcation reactions, combustion, Boudouard reaction, wa- 
ter gas shift reaction, methane formation and steam methane re- 
forming  reactions.  Methane  decomposition  involves  hydrocarbon 
reformation reactions. While hydrogen yield rises largely because 
of the methane decomposition, steam reforming, and hydrocarbon 
reforming reactions. Higher temperature has very good impacts by 
giving higher yields of syngas and reducing the tar and char yields. 
An abundant amount of char would be converted into gaseous con- 
tent with high temperature. High temperatures help in producing 
higher carbon dioxide and lowering the heating value of the pro- 
duced gas. Temperatures greater than 800 °C would lead to high 
conversion of carbon and high molecular weight hydrocarbons to 
form gas and consequently cold gas eﬃciency would be increased 
[191] . The cold gasiﬁcation eﬃciency is the ratio between the en- 
ergy  contained  in  the  product  gas  and  the  energy  contained  in 
the mass of sewage sludge fed. Nevertheless, too higher temper- 
ature may lead to clinker formation due to the high ash content 
of sewage sludge. The partial pressure of the gasifying agent in the 
reactor is of critical importance which has impact on the desired 
product yield. An optimum partial pressure is needed to have more 
interaction with components present in the reactor along with an 
optimum temperature which is responsible for the heating rate to 
convert sewage sludge into high quality syngas. 

5.3.5. Catalyst addition 

The purpose of catalyst addition in the gasiﬁcation system is to 
promote the gasiﬁcation process and to degrade the tar contam- 
inants to produce higher yield of syngas. Tar is a complex mix- 
ture of higher hydrocarbons which needs to be cracked down to 
lower molecular weight hydrocarbons in the gas phase to obtain 
more hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane. The catalyst en- 
ables heat and mass transfer between particles in a beﬁtting man- 
ner. Some catalysts are added to the reactor as an additive or sub- 
stitute for the sand. As the important reactions in gasiﬁcation that 
play a vital part are all endothermic, catalysts are used to lower 
the activation energy to produce high yields of product gas and to 
improve the gasiﬁcation eﬃciency. The placement of catalyst in the 
reactor is dependent on the reaction carried out. 

5.4. Co-gasiﬁcation of sewage sludge 

3 ,  HCl  and  H 

2 O gases, convert into NH 

In the gasiﬁcation process, the properties of sewage sludge af- 
fect  the  produced  products  and  during  the  process  the  intrin- 
sic properties have an impact on lowering the quality of the de- 
sired product. Use of pyrolysis char and sewage sludge is common 
in laboratory scale experiments and also in commercial small to 
medium gasiﬁcation plants. Table 16 shows the gasiﬁcation results 
from sewage sludge and pyrolysis char. Gas yield, tar content, CGE, 
LHV  and  pollutants  like  NH 
2 S  may  vary  depending 
upon the reactors and other conditions. The pollutants containing 
NO and N 
3 , HCN and further reduce to N 
2 
3 and CaO in chars during sewage 
because of the presence of Fe 
sludge gasiﬁcation. During sewage sludge gasiﬁcation, 271 mg/Nm 3 
and 592 mg/Nm 3 of NH 
3 and HCN in syngas and, 1.4 (wt.%) and 0.5 
(wt.%) of nitrogen and sulfur in residues have been reported [200] . 
Higher nitrogen and sulfur content in sewage sludge need to be 
minimized in order to avoid NOx and SOx during gasiﬁcation. To 
clean the syngas and remove such kinds of pollutants, the use of 
scrubbers, use of other feedstocks and catalysts may be used. Gasi- 
ﬁcation of pyrolysis char may give good results rather than using 
sewage sludge directly, because of the more active pores sites in 
the char for the gasiﬁcation reactions in the presence of steam or

saw dust and woody biomass. Mineral content for example Na 
2 O, 
2  and CaO are promising for further 
MgO, Fe 
catalytic use even during gasiﬁcation. These minerals can also add 
value in cement manufacturing, adsorbents, ceramics and agricul- 
ture. High concentrations of heavy metals like Zn, Cd, Cr, Ni, Si and 
Al can restrict the use of gasiﬁcation ash in agriculture and land 
applications. The recovery of P (73–82%) and K elements from gasi- 
ﬁcation ash by using mineral acids is interesting for fertilizer use 
[225] . High concentration of P 
2 O in ash has been ob- 
2 O 
served for sewage sludge rather than blends with other feedstocks. 
Hence, the origin of the feedstocks also signiﬁcantly matters for 
gasiﬁcation and co-gasiﬁcation. To cope with ash and tar content, 
and  to  increase  the  energy  level  of  products,  different  kinds  of 
catalysts can be used in gasiﬁcation and co-gasiﬁcation of sewage 
sludge.

trated in chars cannot be ignored. 

5.5.1. Syngas and tar reforming 

5.5. Catalytic reforming during gasiﬁcation 

In order to increase the product quality and to reduce the pol- 
lutants,  ash  and  heavy  metal  content,  co-gasiﬁcation  of  sewage 
sludge  with  coal  and  biomass:  torriﬁed  biomass  [215] ,  woody 
biomass, saw dust, forestry waste is common using air and steam. 
In  small  to  medium  pilot  scale  plants  co-gasiﬁcation  of  sewage 
sludge is also being used. CGE for co-gasiﬁcation with wood pellets 
and paper sludge is reported as 59.3% and 61.6%, more than sewage 
sludge at 55.12%. Total dry gas yield is higher for co-gasiﬁcation 
with coal (2.5–2.7 Nm 3 /kg). Addition of sewage sludge with coal 
can decrease the CO 
2  emissions which are higher in the case of 
only coal being used. The information on release of pollutants in 
the dry gas product during co-gasiﬁcation of sewage sludge is less 
reported, however it can be anticipated that H 
3 values 
are higher as compared to HCl, HF and PAHs due to higher sulfur 
and nitrogen content in sewage sludge. In addition, it can be con- 
3  content may have re- 
cluded that, more mineral CaO and Fe 
duced these pollutants. Moreover, co-gasiﬁcation of sewage sludge 
gives potential to reduce the residual ash and to decrease the level 
of pollutants. Co-gasiﬁcation with biomass can produce a reduction 
in NH 
2 S. During co-gasiﬁcation, the gas yields may become 
lower, however, it is favorable to produce products with high en- 
ergy content and high carbon conversion. Low tar content, better 
yield of syngas, LHV and cold gas eﬃciency are required to add the 
biomass or coal with sewage sludge as illustrated in Table 17 .

The ash collected from electrostatic precipitators, cyclones and 
fabric ﬁlters during gas cleaning contains heavy metals and is a 
major problem to treat. Due to high ash content, dry gas yield and 
cold gas eﬃciency are affected leading to more tar which is a ma- 
jor constraint in gasiﬁcation reactions and the downstream further 
use of syngas. In Table 18 , the mineral content and heavy metal

and  C 
cleanest energy carriers  which can be produced from renewable 
energy resources for carbon dioxide emission reduction as a solu- 
tion to environmental problems. Along with H

CH

sewage sludge for example, H 
lematic. It is well known that the fuel to be used in internal com- 
bustion engines should have light hydrocarbons to combust eas- 
ily  and  eﬃciently,  so  the  cracking  or  reforming  of  tar  is  essen- 
tial  for  the  syngas  produced  from  sewage  sludge  to  be  used  in 
gas engines. The role of the catalyst is not only reforming tar but 
also  to  produce  higher  yields  of  H 
2  and  CO  having  high  energy 
level with reduction in NOx and SOx. Tar compounds found during 
gasiﬁcation of sewage sludge are (1) N-aromatics (50%): methyl- 
pyridine,  benzo-nitrile, quinoline, indole,  phenyl-pyridine, benzo- 
quinoline and pyridine. (2) O-aromatics (2.6%): phenol and benzo 
furan. (3) S-compounds (4.9%): 2-benzothiophene and propane ni- 
trile.  (4)  Light  Aromatics  (6.5%)  and  PAHs  (36%):  indene,  naph- 
thalene, methyl naphthalene, biphenyl, biphenylene, ﬂuorine, an- 
thracene and phenanthrene [216 , 230 , 231] . Tar reforming involves 
different reactions such as catalytic reforming and thermal reform- 
ing. The advantage of catalytic cracking is the reduction in activa- 
tion energy at lower temperature to decompose the tar. The cata- 
lysts investigated in the literature for tar and syngas reforming in 
sewage sludge gasiﬁcation are: Ni and Fe based catalysts, alumina, 
silica  sand,  TiO 
2 ,  dolomite,  olivine,  CaO,  natural  zeolite,  bio-char 
and activated carbon. The effect of these catalysts is represented 
in Table 19 for improvement in syngas yields, LHV, CGE and reduc- 
tion in tar and pollutants.

5.5.1.1. Bio-char and activated carbon.  Bio-char produced from py- 
rolysis  and  gasiﬁcation  has  the  potential  to  be  used  as  a  cata- 
lyst. As bio-char produced from the gasiﬁcation process is lower 
in quantity than pyrolysis, its surface area and carbonaceous con- 
tent  make  it  one  of  the  superior  bio-chars  for  catalyst  use  pro- 
duced from wastes and biomass. The reason is having metal (Na, 
K, Ca, P, Mg and Al) and mineral contents (MgO, Fe 
3 etc.), 
resulting in improved catalytic activity. Usually, bio-chars are acti- 
vated by steam and chemicals to enhance the surface area and ac- 
tive pores size. In gasiﬁcation most of the reactions involve steam 
and  water  which  make  them  more  promising  catalysts.  Bio-char 
from woody biomass have higher surface area than grass residues 
and almost 80% carbon content. Sewage sludge too has high sur- 
face area (500 m 2 /g) and carbon content (90%) [232] . Therefore, 
co-gasiﬁcation of sewage sludge char with woody biomass is effec- 
tive. Moreover, dispersion of metals (Ni, Fe, Co, Mo, Ce) on bio- 
char  can  further  enhance  the  catalytic  activity  for  tar  reforming 
and reduction of pollutants. Recently, most researchers have also 
used coal based activated carbon and found excellent results for 
syngas with added LHV, gas yield, overall gasiﬁcation eﬃciency, tar 
removal and eradication of toxic gases. The ash from gasiﬁcation of 
sewage sludge has suﬃcient mineral content, which can be more 
effective than Al 
2 and zeolites for utiliza- 
2 , ZrO 
tion as support material for the catalyst. It is anticipated that less 
sintering and deviation in structure would be observed at higher 
temperatures by using sewage sludge ash. Hence, the gasiﬁcation 
products  bio-char  and  ash  have  not  only  positive  environmental 
impact but can also contribute to process economics.

5.5.1.2. Nickel based catalysts.  Ni is known to be effective for the 
cleavage of C –C, C –H and C –O bonds in reforming and tar crack- 
ing  reactions.  Few  researchers  have  reported  Ni  impregnated  on 
activated carbons, lignite char and bio-chars to enhance the cat- 
alytic activity for tar and syngas reforming. The dispersion of nano- 
particles  of  Ni  gives  higher  surface  area  if  it  is  impregnated  on 
lignite  char.  The  size  of  nano-particles  grows  bigger  on  increas- 
ing  the  temperature  during  the  carbonization,  in  turn  it  gives 
more  catalytic  activity  due  to  wider  crystallite  size  as  shown  in 
Fig. 21 . However, at higher temperatures there is more chance of 
coke  deposition  by  using  Ni.  NiO  impregnation  on  alumina,  ac- 
tivated  carbon  and  bio-chars  gives  promising  results  for  higher 
syngas  yields  with  improved  LHV.  NiO  on  ceramic  foam  due  to 
higher pore activity and stability is encouraging for higher yields 
and LHV of gases. Noble metals are recognized for enhanced cat- 
alytic activity, nonetheless they are expensive, however, Ni, Co, Mo 
are inexpensive metals and can contribute well for gasiﬁcation of

sewage  sludge.  Ni-based  activated  carbons  and  bio-chars  are  ef- 
fective for removal of N-containing compounds in tars and reduc- 
3 , perovskites, hydrotalcite, and zeo- 
ing NH 
lites have produced good results for catalytic activity and stability. 
The formation and preparation methods are complex which makes 
them (La 
3 , perovskites, hydrotalcite, and zeolites) less suitable 
for sewage sludge, if the desired purpose is not being fulﬁlled with 
natural catalyst, catalyst with easy preparation and easy regenera- 
tion, then these can be tried in sewage sludge gasiﬁcation for re- 
forming and reducing pollutants.

5.5.1.3. Dolomite,  olivine  and  their  effects.  Many  studies  have  re- 
ported the use of dolomite Ca-Mg(CO 
2 SiO 
4 
as effective additives to obtain higher hydrogen gas yield. Olivine 
has more resistance towards attrition than dolomite and it shows 
a slightly lower activity in sewage sludge gasiﬁcation for tar re- 
moval having the same gas yields and LHV. Olivine and dolomite 
in combination with activated carbons, bio-chars or metals like Ni, 
Fe, Co, Mo can provide favorable results. Dolomite is reported to 
be used as an additive due to its appropriate resistance towards 
catalyst deactivation and coke deposition. Dolomite with steam is 
effective  to  reduce  the  tar  content  especially  benzene  and  PAHs 
from 30 to 10 mg/g sludge daf and 0.27 to 0.18 mg/g sludge daf 
respectively [231] . A comprehensive comparison can be conducted 
for sewage sludge gasiﬁcation with dolomite, olivine, biomass acti- 
vated carbon, coal based activated carbon and zeolites. The highest 
gas  yields  and  tar  removal  eﬃciencies  with  combination  of  coal 
based activated carbon and dolomite is interesting to observe. The 
catalytic activities and spent activities are important to know for 
making any comprehension about the eﬃciency of catalyst. Fig. 22 
shows the total tar content and tar removal eﬃciency by different 
catalyst  combinations.  The  spent  activity  of  coal  based  activated 
carbon  and  dolomite  have  also  shown  higher  tar  removal  than 
other additives and combinations. Whereas activated carbons are 
non-polar and sewage sludge contains more N-compounds which 
are polar in nature. So, used alone activated carbons cannot de- 
crease the tar content whereas addition of additives such as olivine 
and dolomite can increase the tar removal eﬃciency. 

5.5.1.4. CaO and its effects.  Calcium oxide (lime) has wide impor- 
tance in producing more hydrogen and capturing carbon dioxide. 
Besides, producing high hydrogen yield it has an effective im pact 
on reducing tar, N and S compounds. Calcium oxide has applica- 
tions in sewage sludge gasiﬁcation as both a conditioner and ad- 
ditive, but is more effective as a conditioner rather than as an ad- 
2 , and performs 
ditive. As conditioner CaO is converted into Ca(OH)

, NH 3 :443 ppm, H 2 S:470 ppm were 
found at minimum level. Highest CGE and CCE: 97.69 and 
91.18% were reported. 
Highest H 2 (28 vol.%) and CO (21 vol.%) yields were with coal 
based A.C rather than other catalysts. Maximum reduction in 
tar in syngas was also found with coal based activated 
carbon: 0.17 g/Nm 3 
shown results near to A.C. 
A Ni-impregnated A.C gave higher H 2 (31 vol.%) and tar free 
syngas. Tar removal eﬃciency:97% and 114 ppm of NH 3 
lowest of all catalysts. Overall NH 3 with other catalysts was 
146 ppm. 
CGE and CCE are 10% and 5% higher than non-catalytic 
process. Steam and alumina gave 46% more H 2 with higher 
LHV of 3.7 MJ/Nm 3 

as compared to non-catalytic gasiﬁcation. 

, total tar: 8.44 g/kg DSS. Dolomite also 

Ni/A.C produced highest H 2 (28 vol.%) and NH 3 198 ppm 
with highest tar removal eﬃciency 91%. While Fe/A.C 
produced less H 2 S content of 96 ppm with tar removal 
eﬃciency 92% and H 2 26 vol.%. 
Calcined dolomite with DSS was in ﬂuidized bed reactor, A.C 
has been used for tar removal. The total tar removal 
eﬃciency and the H 2 content in syngas were 88.4% and 
32.1 vol.%. LHV of syngas was 7 MJ/Nm 3 
. 
The combination of Fenton’s reagent and CaO can 
complementarily reduce the HCN and NH 3 13.71–17.67 mL/g 
and 17.77–23.45 mL/g. These are also proved to decrease the 
tar content. 
Dolomite showed 45% reduction in tar content and 90% 
decrease in PAHs as compared to alumina (35%) and olivine 
(20%). It was observed that hydrogen and carbon dioxide 
content elevated and les tar produced by combination of air 
and steam with catalyst. 
H 2 gas was increased up-to 20–36% with tar removal 
eﬃciency 71%. Highest LHV of gas and CGE were 3.6 MJ/Nm 3 
and 50%. Highest gas production was 3Nm 3 
H 2 production was increased from 72–82% at 650 °C. Highest 
surface area was for 3A molecular sieves which leads to more 
CGE (78%) as compared to others. Addition of metal element 
Ni and Fe enhanced the tar cracking, methane reforming and 
char conversion into gases. 
Tar yield: 2.19%, dry gas yield:1.23 Nm 3 
gas:10.65 MJ/Nm 3

the catalytic action while as an additive CaO remains the same. Ca 
species are considered to break the C –C and C –H bonds to crack 
the large molecules into lower molecular weight species. The com- 
bination of Fenton’s reagent and lime gave promising results in re- 
ducing  NOx  and  SOx.  As  sewage  sludge  has  more  nitrogen  con- 
tent in the form of N-pyrroles, N-pyridine and N-nitriles, Fenton’s 
reagent converts nitriles and pyrroles into amine and pyridine and 
further into indole in tar. The indole is stable and diﬃcult to de-

favorable  for  sulfur  reduction  during  sewage  sludge  gasiﬁcation. 
Calcium salts convert Quaternary-N into amines and pyridines and 
further into N

sewage sludge and form Fe-N and CaCx-N and further decompose

In addition, CaO with support materials Al 

2  and 
dispersion of metals like Ni, Co, Mo, and Ce has great potential for 
more hydrogen production and tar removal. The only problem is 
its deactivation during regeneration which presents discontinuous 
hydrogen production. A concept has been proposed for CaO based 
chemical looping. Because of the energy eﬃcient and economic as- 
pects, the calcium based looping gasiﬁcation has gained more at- 
tention in recent years. A schematic diagram of chemical looping 
is shown in Fig. 23 . Essentially, the lime absorbs carbon dioxide 

via an exothermic carbonation reaction and by endothermic calci- 
nation it releases its captured CO 
2  reversibly, which can be used 
for dry reforming as presented in Eq. (6) [236 , 237] : 

Carbonation: CaO 
= −178.2 kJ/mol 

(s) + CO 2 ↔ CaCO 

3 (s) (cid:2)H 298 

(6) 

This  exothermic  reaction  provides  heat  to  other  reactions  of 
gasiﬁcation  and  leads  to  more  hydrogen  production  and  tar  re- 
forming. Use of lime for the capture of CO 
2  and tar cracking has 
the beneﬁt of being an exothermic reaction. Moreover, it also has 
also the beneﬁt of increasing heat rates for enhanced CGE and in- 
ﬂuencing water gas shift equilibrium for hydrogen production at 
lower temperature. 

5.5.2. Syngas in combined heat and power (CHP) and biofuel 

Syngas produced from the gasiﬁer has the potential to be used 
in combined heat and power plants. The gasiﬁcation process gives 
a  signiﬁcant  amount  of  energy  in  the  form  of  syngas  that  can 
be  utilized  to  obtain  energy.  Data  has  been  collected  for  pilot, 
demonstration units and commercial scale plants which are using 
sewage sludge as a feedstock to produce heat and power and is 
depicted in Table 20 . This gathered data shows that syngas from 
sewage sludge can play a vital role in internal combustion engines 
and small to medium boilers having an average energy value of 
5.5  MJ/Nm 3  for  LHV.  A  very  few number  of  plants  are reported 
which are using sewage sludge with other feedstocks like biomass 
for  co-gasiﬁcation.  The  heat  and  power  produced  from  sewage 
sludge gasiﬁcation plants is being used for electricity consumption 
of  their  own  plants,  fulﬁlling  their  requirement  for  drying  oper- 
ations and producing electricity for commercial purposes. Syngas 
produced either from sewage sludge or from co-gasiﬁcation with 
coal and biomass is also commendable to produce heat and power. 
However, co-gasiﬁcation and catalytic gasiﬁcation may add more

energy content to the syngas in terms of CCE, CGE and LHV. Not 
only to produce heat and power, the syngas is useful to produce 
liquid  fuels  and  chemicals  by  the  Fischer-Tropsch  synthesis  pro- 
cess. By using the Fischer-Tropsch process, fuels and chemicals like 
methanol, ethanol, gasoline, di-methyl ether can be produced by 
further catalytic reactions and distillation at high temperature and 
pressure. A comprehensive ﬂow diagram of sewage sludge gasiﬁca- 
tion is shown in Fig. 24 . Thus, sewage sludge being a waste mate- 
rial can contribute to add value in energy and power, to lessen the 
burden from fossil fuels and to decrease GHG emissions. 

In the context of the circular economy and the wide range of 
products  and  by-products  produced  from  gasiﬁcation  of  sewage 
sludge seems appropriate and feasible. The energy recovery from 
syngas, use of char and ash for catalyst or adsorbent and recovery 
of P, N, and K are all value addition for the circular economy. Hy- 
drogen separation from syngas to produce a renewable fuel is most 
interesting  for  researchers.  The  viability  of  sewage  sludge  gasiﬁ- 
cation  depends  on  many  factors  which  includes  quantity  of  raw 
sewage sludge production, capital costs for installation of plants, 
operation and maintenance costs, technology to be used, electric 
or thermal power for drying operations, quality of products and 
by-products,  land  cost,  labor  cost  and  other  utility  costs.  These 
costs vary for every different scenario and location or region. So, 
it is diﬃcult to give the exact statistics for the proﬁt generation 
and energy recovery from the gasiﬁcation process. However, using 
sewage sludge for gasiﬁcation, the nature and quality of products, 
by-products and toxicities associated with them are obvious. The 
control measures should be in place to avoid pollutants. Toxicity 
of sewage sludge is contained in gas (NOx, SOx, HF, HCl, PAHs and 
dioxins, liquid-tar (N, O and S compounds) and solid (heavy met- 
als). 

5.6. Super critical water gasiﬁcation (SCWG) for sewage sludge 

Another growing technique to recover energy from dewatered 
sewage  sludge  is  supercritical  water  gasiﬁcation  (SCWG)  operat- 

ing at 40 0–60 0 °C, high pressure and long residence time, which 
produces gases similar to a conventional gasiﬁcation system along 
with the potential for phosphorous recovery with other inorganic 
elements. Use of catalysts in SCWG may produce favorable results 
to add more value to the end-products [256] . Due to the use of 
high temperature and pressure, all the mineral content and heavy 
metal become concentrated in the residue and gives a potential for 
resource recovery. Phosphorous recovery using an uncatalyzed pro- 
cess is reported as 95% by using SCWG [257] . Though this process 
is being used for hydrogen production and extraction of inorganics, 
it involves high cost which does not lead it to be a viable commer- 
cial solution. In future, more studies are required for its viability. 

5.7. Challenges for gasiﬁcation of sewage sludge 

In this section, sewage sludge gasiﬁcation has been discussed 
and compared with co-gasiﬁcation and catalytic gasiﬁcation. The 
key challenges for effective use of sewage sludge gasiﬁcation are 
the following: (1) Due to high moisture and ash content the qual- 
ity of gasiﬁcation products is low. (2) Low LHV, CGE, CCE and tar 
content  cause  the  problem  of  downstream  utilization,  for  exam- 
ple, blocking of fuel lines in engines and lowered combustion qual- 
ity in boilers. (3) Co-gasiﬁcation with coal, woody biomass, straws, 
forestry wastes and manures improves the quality of syngas. How- 
ever,  appropriate  blending  ratios  and  operating  conditions  make 
improvement in one parameter for example high hydrogen yield 
but at the same time more tar in syngas and solid residues is prob- 
lematic. (4) Co-gasiﬁcation with coal may help to reduce the GHG 
emissions, nonetheless, high ash and heavy metal content would 
affect the overall eﬃciency. (5) Use of catalysts in sewage sludge 
gasiﬁcation and co-gasiﬁcation have shown promising results such 
as, hydrogen yield at up to 51 vol.%, tar yield reduced to 95% and 
LHV improved to 9 MJ/Nm 3 . The coke formation, resulting in early 
deactivation of active pore sites on the catalyst is challenging to 
maintain  the  continuous  improved  gas  yields  with  high  energy 
content. (6) Nitrogenous compounds are present in gas, char and

ash of sewage sludge, which leads to GHG emissions and toxicity 
in the ash if it is to be utilized in land and agriculture applica- 
tions. In tar, there are also nitrogenous compounds present such 
as, amines and pyrroles which can lead to ammonia and HCN and 
results in GHG emissions. Co-gasiﬁcation and catalytic gasiﬁcation 
helps  to  reduce  nitrogenous  compounds  and  converts  them  into 
N 
2 to some extent, however more in-depth studies are needed for 
sewage sludge. (7) Similarly, sulfur content in gas, char, ash and 
tar is inevitable and challenging to decrease by using suitable cata- 
lysts. Iron and calcium salts provide encouraging results which can 
be improved more with further studies. (8) Suitable selection of 
catalysts for reduction of pollutants and tar is challenging due to 
the high ash content of sewage sludge which affects the product 
quality and also regeneration issues of catalysts are diﬃcult. (9) It 
has been seen that for pilot, demonstration and commercial scale 
plants in different countries are not using any catalyst except cal- 
cium oxide because of coke formation and regeneration issues due 
to the high ash content of sewage sludge. Use of catalysts has been 
found in several laboratory scale studies which gave encouraging 
results to test in commercial and large scale plants. The catalyst 
combinations  other  than  Ni-A.C,  natural  catalysts  (dolomite  and 
olivine) or char from pyrolysis, like Co-Mo, Co-Ce, zeolites and per- 
ovskites are challenging for sewage sludge gasiﬁcation. However, 
more studies are required for their trials. (10) Ash agglomeration 
and clinker formation at the grate of the reactor and methods for 
ash removal from the reactor is challenges in selection of reactor 
technology. Syngas cleaning using appropriate catalyst or additive 
ﬁlters, liquid or dry ﬁlters is also a key issue. (11) If sewage sludge 
is being directly fed into the gasiﬁer, the consumption of energy 
for drying is a major issue, otherwise using pyrolytic char as the 

feed stock is promising for gasiﬁcation reactions in the presence of 
steam and air. (12) The recovery of P, N and K from ash is also a 
potential challenge for a circular economy, environmental and so- 
cial problems associated with sewage sludge. 

6. Combustion of sewage sludge 

This  section  concerns  the  oxidation  of  sewage  sludge  in  the 
presence  of  excess  oxygen.  The  combustion  of  sewage  sludge  is 
in  general  terms  similar  to  other  solid  fuels.  The  excess  oxygen 
provided  acts  to  combust  all  carbon  and  volatile  compounds  at 
temperatures  typically  greater  than  10 0 0  °C.  In  the  context  of 
sewage sludge combustion, there are three main aspects, to gen- 
erate heat and power, to eliminate the effect of hazardous com- 
pounds present in the sewage sludge and to reduce the volume 
of sewage sludge [190 , 258] . The main three products of combus- 
tion are ﬂue gas, slag and ﬂy ash [259] . Some systems are only 
developed  to  obtain  heat  and  power  generation,  but  along  with 
heat, some hazardous contaminants in the form of ﬂue gases con- 
4 , NOx, SOx, PAHs and dioxins/furans are emit- 
taining CO 
ted which can cause serious health and environmental issues. Fly 
ash or bottom ash contain numerous materials which can be ex- 
ploited  for  utilization  in  other  applications  for  example,  sewage 
sludge may contain phosphorous for use as a nutrient in agricul- 
tural applications.

6.1. Development of incinerators for sewage sludge 

During the combustion of sewage sludge, the generated ﬂue gas 
must be clean to ensure compliance with regulated emission lim- 

30 

N. Gao, K. Kamran and C. Quan et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 79 (2020) 100843 

its. Factors which affect the ﬂue gas pollutant composition are, the 
nature of the feedstock, the temperature inside the incinerator for 
drying, pyrolysis and combustion, ﬂue gas ﬂow rates and tempera- 
ture. Apart from this, heat transfer rates, proper reduction of char 
or feedstock or appropriate ash disposal systems (manual or auto- 
matic) are of great importance during the incineration process. In 
the particular case of sewage sludge, moisture content is high and 
therefore there is a requirement for pre-drying or use of hot air 
for drying inside the incinerator. In addition, the high ash content 
of sewage sludge would produce an increasing bed height, partic- 
ularly for ﬂuidized bed combustion, which can disturb the whole 
combustion process and may create problems while cleaning of the 
gas due to high ﬂy ash content. Hence, the selection of incinera- 
tor design has vital importance in the combustion process. In this 
regard, several incinerator technology designs have been reported 
for sewage sludge for example multiple hearth, ﬂuidized bed, ro- 
tary kiln and other furnace types [260–263] . The design of multiple 
hearth incinerators contains several hearths as the name suggests, 
which are attached to a rotating shaft and enables feeding of the 
sludge from the top to the bottom in drying, pyrolysis and com- 
bustion zones. Old style multiple hearths had a problem of insuf- 
ﬁcient drying in the upper zone and combustion at lower zones. 
Later on, engineers added additional fuel lines to increase the eﬃ- 
ciency of mixing, drying and combustion at their respective zones. 
Fluidized beds have received much more recent attention and in a 
very short time a large number of these design of incinerators have 
been used for sewage sludge combustion. Fluidized beds (bubbling 
and circulating) have the same design as discussed for pyrolysis 
and gasiﬁcation, typically comprising a bed of sand. The hot ﬂu- 
idizing air helps to maintain good heat transfer rates with attrition 
of fuel particles until complete reduction and combustion. The in- 
ternal designs may vary including spout formation inside the ﬂu- 
idized bed or circulating ﬂuidized beds. Rotary kilns are also used 
for combustion of sewage sludge in small to medium scale incin- 
erators. This furnace kiln type comprises a large steel vessel, of- 
ten lined with ceramic materials which rotates slowly while com- 
pleting combustion for ﬂue gas. Heat transfer in the rotary kiln is 
lower as compared to multiple hearths and ﬂuidized beds due to 
poorer mixing and infrequent contact of the waste with the hot 
wall which results in incomplete vapor formation leaving higher 
levels of char. In order to assess the life cycle assessment for com- 
bustion of sewage sludge in a ﬂuidized bed combustor and rotary 
kiln, the ﬂuidized bed combustor is reported to be better in terms 
of environmental sustainability rather than the rotary kiln [264] . 
Other furnaces have been used for incineration of sewage sludge 
such as combining multiple hearth and ﬂuidized bed, cyclone fur- 
naces, and for co-ﬁring of sewage sludge and coal in pulverized 
form. 

6.1.1. Technological strength and market competitiveness of 
incinerators 

The  technological  strength  of  incinerators  can  be  descried  by 
evaluating  them  using  the  Analytical  Hierarchy  Process  (AHP). 
There are three main incinerators for which technological strength 
and market competitiveness may be analyzed. Higher heat trans- 
fer  is  a  desirable  parameter  which  gives  more  drying,  pyrolysis 
and  combustion  of  char  resulting  in  more  ﬂue  gas  and  reduc- 
tion in solid residues. In this regard, ﬂuidized bed incinerators are 
proven  for  these  parameters.  Particularly  for  sewage  sludge,  the 
ash content is higher and it may increase the bed height and also 
ash  disposal  is  a  key  consideration.  Rotary  kilns  due  to  moving 
and conveying fuel in the forward direction at a particular angle 
seems  better  for  less  ash  disposal  problems,  however  they  have 
low heat transfer rates. Table 21 shows the technological strength 
of incinerators and Fig. 25 illustrates the relation of technological 
strength and market competitiveness. Most positive attribute (ﬂue

ative attribute is ash disposal. 

6.2. Flue gas cleaning systems and pollutant emissions 

The ﬂue gas from a sewage sludge incinerator consists of partic- 
ulates, NOx, SOx, heavy metals, PAHs, PCDD/PCDF, etc. [265–268] . 
To  reduce  these  pollutants,  sewage  sludge  can  be  co-combusted 
with coal and biomass within the incinerator [259 , 269] . The rea- 
son to use coal [266 , 270 , 271] and biomass (wood pellets [261 , 272] , 
forestry waste [273] ) as added fuels with sewage sludge combus- 
tion is to  avoid agglomeration and de-ﬂuidization due  to higher 
content  of  ash  [274 , 275] .  Another  way  to  reduce  these  noxious 
compounds are scrubbers or ﬁlters. After the incinerator furnace, 
a boiler can produce steam for electricity and to pre-heat the inlet 
air and drying of sewage sludge. Cyclones help to extract unburnt 
char, ash and dust particles which may be recycled to the incin- 
erator for further combustion. An electrostatic precipitator may be 
used to extract the dust particles and ﬂy ash in the ﬂue gas left af- 
ter the cyclones. Sulphur oxides may be removed by scrubbers us- 
ing for example, Ca(OH) 
2 , also NOx can be reduced by addition of 
ammonium hydroxide or urea. Metals such as Cd and Hg and diox- 
ins and furans (PCDD and PCDF) can be controlled by addition of 
activated carbon with downstream fabric ﬁlter capture [276] . It has 
also been reported that adding CaO with sewage sludge and coal 
can improve the performance for devolatalization, desulfurization 
and denitriﬁcation for clean disposal of sewage sludge. The addi- 
tion of CaO also helps in lowering the temperature for combustion 
[277–279] . The combination of FeCl 
3 and CaO with combustion is 
2 , HCl and heavy 
reported favorably to reduce the emissions of SO 
metals such as Pb, Zn and Cu [280] . If sewage sludge is being dis- 
posed of in cement kilns, then there is a chance of more sulfur 
emissions which can be reduced by using suitable co-feedstock or 
scrubbers/ ﬁlters [281] . Several studies are found in the literature 
which report decreased emissions to minimum levels. The invest-

ment cost for incinerators is estimated at 70 0–150 0 € / dry ton of 
sewage  sludge  and  its  operational  and  maintenance  cost  is  esti- 
mated at 250–300 €/dry ton of sewage sludge [282] . This higher 
cost is due to extensive cleaning of gas systems and emissions con- 
trol. 

6.3. Sewage sludge ash from combustion 

Sewage sludge ash is produced in signiﬁcant quantities derived 
as  a  by-product  from  the  combustion  of  sewage  sludge  mainly 
through its use as an auxiliary fuel in the cement industry. Several 
studies have explored and determined using life cycle assessments, 
tangible  environmental  paybacks  by  using  sewage  sludge  ash  as 
a  supplementary  cementitious  material  [283] .  For  the  continued 
usage  of  sewage  sludge  ash  as  a  building  material,  there  must 
be  suﬃcient  risk  assessments  to  avoid  the  hazardous  effects  of 
heavy metals which could be potentially released into the environ- 
ment during the utilization of the product materials. Researchers 
have analyzed the results from laboratory and ﬁeld tests on the 

leaching of sewage sludge ash being used in applications such as 
concrete, road pavements, blocks, clinker production, mortar, road 
pavements, geo-technics and ceramics [284] . In Table 22 a com- 
parison  of  elemental  analyses  is  made  between  bottom  ash  and 
ﬂy ash produced from the combustion of sewage sludge together 
with limit values. The values for the ash deviate and indicate that 
it  could  be  used  as  a  fertilizer  material  after  suitable  treatment 
and  extraction  to  prevent  environmental  impacts  from  its  appli- 
cation. The range of mineral contents in sewage sludge ash, coal 
sludge ash and cement are given in Table 23 , which illustrates the 
requirement for cement manufacturing can be fulﬁlled by sewage 
sludge ash to some extent. 

Thus, the drawback of the combustion process is the production 
of ash with the potential for emission of hazardous compounds. 
Co-combustion  has  been  undertaken  in  practice  and  has  shown 
promising  results.  As  compared  to  deploying  ash  for  agriculture 
purposes directly, it is better to be used in cement plants to avoid 
environmental issues. A schematic diagram for sewage sludge com- 
bustion is presented in Fig. 26 .

7. Conclusion 

It may be concluded that despite having high moisture content, 
ash content and heavy metal content, thermochemical routes are 
promising for the management of sewage sludge for the recovery 
of energy. This review has produced a comprehensive comparison 
of  pyrolysis,  gasiﬁcation  and  incineration  of  sewage  sludge.  Also 
considered are co-processing and the use of catalysts. The pollu- 
tant emissions are considerably less for pyrolysis while enabling 
the production of a bio-oil and char for heating and further use. 
Torreﬁed char, pyrolytic char and hydro char have potential as cat- 
alysts or adsorbents. Gasiﬁcation, co-gasiﬁcation and catalytic gasi- 
ﬁcation of sewage sludge also showed production of high quality 
syngas. Comparative analysis of pyrolysis and gasiﬁcation coupled 
with catalytic processes have been shown to be eﬃcient to deal 
with the pollutants and produce energy products. Due to the high 
level of pollutant contamination present in sewage sludge, com- 
bustion or incineration does not appear attractive from an envi- 
ronmental  and  socio-economic  point  of  view.  It  produces  more 
pollutants in the ﬂue gases and ash, resulting in high operational 
and maintenance cost  as  compared to  pyrolysis and gasiﬁcation. 
While recovery of phosphorous and use of ash in agriculture and 
in the construction industry has the potential for positive impacts 
on the environment and economic evaluation. Conversely, ash to 
be applied in these applications must meet the legal regulations 
which is far better and more environmentally sustainable than raw 
sewage sludge usage in landﬁll and agriculture. Ideally, in terms 
of the circular economy, sewage sludge becomes zero waste mate- 
rial producing energy (syngas and bio-oil), a wide range of valu- 
able products and recovery of phosphorous, nitrogen, and potas- 
sium present in considerable amount. 

8. Future prospects and recommendations 

The  most  important  factors  to  suggest  for  sewage  sludge  are 
the need for innovations in pre-treatment, process intensiﬁcation, 
sludge valorization, resource recovery, energy recovery and costs. 
Thermochemical processes appear better than other conventional 
techniques  due  to  the  above  mentioned  factors.  However,  a  key 
consideration is the Technology Readiness Level (TRL), for exam- 
ple for pyrolysis technologies, TRL levels are low (4-5) resulting in 
less commercial viability. The reason is, the main products are char 
and bio-oil which are not ready for commercial use except perhaps 
use in gasiﬁcation or heating oil after upgrading. As the pyrolysis 
is carried out at lower temperatures than gasiﬁcation and combus- 
tion, so the high moisture content inﬂuences the bio-oil compo- 
sition and char quality. Bio-oil upgrading seems attractive due to 
the bio-oil having physio-chemical properties near to heavy fuel 
oil, yet co-pyrolysis or addition of catalyst is needed for that pur- 
pose. Use of catalysts and combinations of catalysts may help to 
upgrade pyrolytic oil to be used commercially. Similarly, chars for 
use as catalysts or adsorbents are promising, nonetheless their ac- 
tivation is required for commercial usage. Thus three aspects: pre- 
treatment, energy recovery and resource recovery are suggested for 
pyrolysis for further study. While exploring research articles and 
reports at internet level, rarely were commercial facilities for pyrol- 
ysis of sewage sludge found. On the other hand, many commercial 
and pilot plant entities for sewage sludge gasiﬁcation have been 
listed  in  this  manuscript,  showing  energy  recovery  (syngas)  and 
resource recovery (P, N and other minerals). The process intensi- 
ﬁcation has been shown with co-gasiﬁcation, which can be more 
improved by using catalysts. Although catalysts would add cost in 
the operation and regeneration process, their use results in an in- 
crease in syngas energy level and mitigation of pollutants which 
would be advantageous. In this manuscript, a number of catalysts 
and additives are listed which have been applied in-situ and ex- 

situ at laboratory scale level. This concept can be perceived to en- 
hance the eﬃciency of the sewage sludge gasiﬁcation process at 
pilot, demonstration or commercial scale. The addition of catalysts 
in the sewage sludge gasiﬁcation process would be helpful to uplift 
the TRL value from 6 to 9. Increase in TRL value means, it would be 
very easy for investors to invest capital in sewage sludge gasiﬁca- 
tion. Process intensiﬁcation, sludge reduction and energy recovery 
is related to syngas and chemicals production, while resource re- 
covery is associated with the heavy metals and minerals content 
present in gasiﬁcation ash. The pollutant emissions during sewage 
sludge are found with more nitrogen and sulfur content and the 
use of catalysts and additives are helpful to reduce NOx and SOx. 
Hence, catalytic gasiﬁcation is promising for technological devel- 
opment, alleviation of pollutants for environmentally friendly pro- 
duced products and addition of social-economic beneﬁts. The pure 
and clean syngas would be combusted with coal /other fuels, con- 
tributing towards reducing the load/burden on fossil fuels and a 
deﬁnite positive impact on the circular economy. 

Reactor  technologies  for  thermochemical  options  have  a  vital 
role to play. Operational parameters and design of reactors during 
the process have a great inﬂuence on the product quality. Some- 
times,  a  reactor  may  have  one  most  attributed  positive  quality 
but  at  the  same  time  the  sum  of  many  other  negative  aspects 
may  be  present  which  can  make  it  less  appropriate  on  techno- 
logical strength and certainly in terms of market competitiveness. 
The  analysis  carried  out  in  this  manuscript  on  the  reactor  tech- 
nologies in thermochemical processing routes are recommended. 
It may help to intensify the process for value added products. In 
the future, more detailed studies are required on the barriers (high 
moisture, ash and heavy metal content) to enhance the products 
quality  and  to  make  them  readily  available  for  commercial  pur- 
poses.
