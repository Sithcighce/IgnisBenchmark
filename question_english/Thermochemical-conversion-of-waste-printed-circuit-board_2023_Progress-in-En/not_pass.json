    "question_text": "Based on the provided paper content, analyze the hydrothermal decomposition of brominated epoxy resins in waste printed circuit boards, focusing specifically on the temperature-dependent decomposition efficiency and product distribution. Explain how temperature affects resin decomposition and identify the key temperature thresholds mentioned in the paper, including the transition between subcritical and supercritical water conditions.",
    "standard_answer": "The hydrothermal decomposition of brominated epoxy resins in WPCBs shows significant temperature dependence in both decomposition efficiency and product distribution. According to the paper, 'more than 80% of the resin was mainly decomposed into phenol at temperatures above 300°C,' indicating that substantial decomposition occurs well below the supercritical point. This demonstrates that temperatures of 300°C and above provide sufficient thermal energy for effective resin breakdown, with phenol being the primary decomposition product. The paper also specifies that 'When the water condition exceeds the critical point (Tc = 374°C, Pc = 221 bar), it acquires the supercritical state,' marking a clear transition in water properties. However, the paper does not provide comparative data showing enhanced decomposition efficiency under supercritical versus subcritical conditions. The temperature progression affects decomposition pathways, with the 300°C threshold being particularly significant for achieving high resin conversion rates. The efficient decomposition at temperatures above 300°C but below 374°C demonstrates that substantial resin conversion can be achieved without requiring supercritical conditions, though supercritical water may facilitate different reaction mechanisms due to altered water properties including reduced dielectric constant and enhanced diffusivity.",
