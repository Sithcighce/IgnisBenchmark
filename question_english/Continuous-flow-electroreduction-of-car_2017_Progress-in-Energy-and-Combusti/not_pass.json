    "question_text": "How do gas diffusion layers (GDLs) and catalyst immobilization techniques affect the performance of continuous-flow CO₂ electrolyzers, and what are the underlying mechanisms related to mass transport and polarization losses?",
    "standard_answer": "Gas diffusion layers (GDLs) and catalyst immobilization techniques significantly influence continuous-flow CO₂ electrolyzer performance by optimizing mass transport and minimizing polarization losses. GDLs serve as porous substrates that facilitate efficient transport of CO₂ gas and liquid electrolytes to the catalyst while maintaining electronic contact with current collectors. The hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties of GDLs must be carefully balanced: proper wetting ensures sufficient contact time between the electrolyte and catalyst for CO₂ reduction, but excessive hydrophilicity promotes competing H₂ evolution. As demonstrated in a recent study, the immobilization technique influences both the measured current values and the product distribution. In this study, it was also suggested that n-Cu was ideal for preparing GDLs with lowered polarization losses, thus maximizing the energy efficiency of the electrolyzer. These mechanisms collectively improve CO₂ conversion rates by addressing mass transport limitations in continuous-flow systems, where refreshed reactants prevent product accumulation and maintain high reaction rates.",
