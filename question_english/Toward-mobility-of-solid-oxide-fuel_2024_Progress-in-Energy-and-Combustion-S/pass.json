    "question_text": "Why does carbon deposition occur more severely with heavier hydrocarbons than lighter ones in SOFC anodes, and how do heterogeneous and homogeneous reaction pathways contribute to this?",
    "standard_answer": "Carbon deposition is more severe with heavier hydrocarbons due to their weaker C–C bonds compared to the strong C–H bonds in lighter hydrocarbons like methane, facilitating easier decomposition into carbon. Heterogeneous pathways involve surface reactions on the Ni catalyst, where hydrocarbons decompose directly into carbon and hydrogen (e.g., CₓHᵧ → xC + y/2 H₂) or via the Boudouard reaction (2CO → C + CO₂). This leads to graphitic carbon fibers that degrade anode performance. Homogeneous pathways occur in the gas phase, where pyrolysis at high temperatures produces radicals and intermediates like C₂H₄ and C₂H₂, which recombine into polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and form amorphous soot. For heavier hydrocarbons such as iso-octane, gas-phase reactions are significant due to lower activation energies for C–C scission, whereas methane primarily undergoes heterogeneous deposition at typical SOFC temperatures (<1000 K). The combined effects of these pathways result in higher carbon accumulation, obstructing active sites and reducing cell durability.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "Since the C–H bonds in CH₄ are much stronger than the C–C bonds in heavier hydrocarbons, the carbon deposition is mainly from the heterogeneous route for methane at the typical SOFC operation temperatures (<1000 K). However, for higher hydrocarbons such as iso-octane, the gas-phase pyrolysis route of carbon formation cannot be ignored.",
      "2": "The carbon from heterogeneous reactions occurs mainly in the form of graphitic fibers, while the carbon from homogeneous reactions is amorphous."

    "question_text": "How do proton-conductive electrolytes like BaZr₀.₈Y₀.₂O₃ (BZY) enhance carbon tolerance in SOFCs fueled with wet hydrocarbons, and what is the mechanism involving OH(s) species?",
    "standard_answer": "Proton-conductive electrolytes such as BZY enhance carbon tolerance in SOFCs by facilitating the dissociation of water vapor into hydroxyl groups (OH(s)) on the anode surface, which actively participate in carbon removal reactions. The mechanism involves the spillover of OH(s) species to Ni nanoparticle surfaces, where they oxidize deposited carbon to CO and H₂ through reactions like C + 2OH(s) → CO + H₂O. This process is accelerated by the high proton conductivity of BZY, which promotes H⁺ transport and water dissociation at lower temperatures (e.g., 600°C). Additionally, the in situ exsolution of Ni nanoparticles from BZY creates a large surface area with short diffusion paths for oxygen-related species, further increasing the carbon removal rate. For wet hydrocarbons like propane, the presence of steam generates OH(s), preventing carbon accumulation and enabling stable operation for over 3000 hours. This combination of proton conduction and nanocatalyst exsolution significantly improves fuel flexibility and durability in mobile applications.",

Assume hydrogen storage at 70 MPa and 20°C with a volumetric energy density of 4.8 MJ L⁻¹, and LPG with 23.1 MJ L⁻¹.",
    "standard_answer": "To calculate the volumetric energy density advantage, compare the energy stored per unit volume for LPG and hydrogen. Hydrogen at 70 MPa and 20°C has a volumetric energy density of 4.8 MJ L⁻¹. LPG has a volumetric energy density of 23.1 MJ L⁻¹. The ratio of LPG to hydrogen energy density is 23.1 / 4.8 ≈ 4.81. This means LPG stores about 4.81 times more energy per liter than hydrogen. Since LPG requires only 1/5 (0.2 times) the tank volume of hydrogen for the same energy content, the effective advantage is confirmed: for a given energy requirement, the LPG tank volume is 80% smaller. Quantitatively, if E is the energy needed, the hydrogen tank volume V_H2 = E / 4.8, and the LPG tank volume V_LPG = E / 23.1. The volume ratio V_LPG / V_H2 = (E / 23.1) / (E / 4.8) = 4.8 / 23.1 ≈ 0.208, or about 1/5, aligning with the paper's statement. This highlights LPG's suitability for space-constrained mobile applications.",

    "standard_answer": "In situ optical characterization techniques like near-infrared thermal imaging (NIRTI) and Raman spectroscopy provide real-time, noninvasive insights into anode reaction mechanisms and carbon deposition in SOFCs. NIRTI measures thermal variations on the anode surface with high spatial (0.1 mm) and temperature (0.1°C) resolution, distinguishing exothermic and endothermic processes. For example, temperature drops during propane feeding indicate rapid carbon deposition, while rises signal oxidation reactions. Raman spectroscopy identifies carbonaceous species through vibrational bands: the D-band corresponds to amorphous carbon from homogeneous reactions, and the G-band to graphite carbon from heterogeneous pathways. This allows mapping of carbon location and dynamics, such as identifying the Ni-YSZ interface as the most active site for deposition. Combined, these techniques reveal intertwined effects of reforming, coking, and electrochemical oxidation, enabling optimization of materials and operating conditions to mitigate degradation and enhance fuel tolerance.",

Specifically, what performance improvements in power density are documented, and what catalytic activity is attributed to Ru–CeO₂? Ensure your answer includes the mechanisms supported by the citations.",
    "standard_answer": "The addition of an extra catalytic layer such as Ru–CeO₂ on Ni-based anodes significantly enhances the power density of SOFCs when fueled with propane. According to the paper, the integration of the Ru–CeO₂ layer led to a substantial increase in power density, rising from less than 10 mW cm⁻² to 160 mW cm⁻² at 450°C and from 298 mW cm⁻² to 395 mW cm⁻² at 500°C. This improvement is attributed to the high catalytic activity of Ru–CeO₂ in the partial oxidation of hydrocarbons like propane, which facilitates the reforming process. The catalytic layer promotes the conversion of propane into more electrochemically active species, thereby boosting the overall electrochemical performance. The documented power density enhancements are directly linked to the catalytic properties of Ru–CeO₂, as it is among the first materials used as an anode reforming layer due to its effectiveness in partial oxidation reactions. These mechanisms are supported by the cited evidence, focusing on the measurable performance gains and the catalytic role without extrapolating unsupported claims about carbon deposition or fuel conversion rates.",
