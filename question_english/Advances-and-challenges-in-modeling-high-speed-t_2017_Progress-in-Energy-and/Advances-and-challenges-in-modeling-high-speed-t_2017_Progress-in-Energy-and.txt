Combustion environments in propulsion systems involve the interaction of a variety of physics. In devices
such as augmentors, ramjets and scramjets, such environments include the interaction between combus-
tion, high-intensity turbulence, and/or strong flow compressions and expansions, physics which are termed
here high-speed combustion. With this motivation in mind, this paper addresses: What are the problems
encountered when modeling these interactions, or in other words, what are the problems of turbulent-com-
bustion modeling? Do such interactions need modeling? What are the challenges when going from model-
ing low-speed- to high-speed-combustion problems? This work addresses these questions by summarizing
several modeling studies of gaseous high-speed-combustion problems, and attempts to interpret some pre-
dictions in the context of the models’ basic assumptions. Interestingly, the challenges to model high-speed
combustion are such that a reader not interested in this topic but in the general one of modeling turbulent
combustion may find the present paper useful.

1. Introduction

gradients

PCombustion processes involve highly-nonlinear chemical reac-
tions and many species. These reactions can enhance the composi-
tional
the micromixing
consequently,
(molecular mixing), which in turn affects the reactions. In a turbu-
lent flow, these processes can be weakly or strongly coupled to the
turbulence. In particular, turbulence increases the mixing and conse-
quently enhances the combustion [1]. In turn, the combustion can
intensify the turbulence via flow expansion [1]. As a result, the tur-
bulent fluctuations can be very large [2]. The combustion can also
dampen the turbulence by increasing the fluid viscosity. Further-
more, pressure and density gradients can reach levels and align in a
way to produce or dampen turbulence via baroclinicity. All these
phenomena are termed turbulent combustion and it is the main
interest of the present work.

PIn propulsion systems, turbulent combustion has some of the fol-
lowing features. Aero-turbine engines typically inject a hydrocar-
bon-based liquid fuel into the combustion chamber [3]. The fuel
vaporizes and then burns in a way that is difficult to classify as
purely premixed or purely nonpremixed, but is rather classified as
partially premixed ([3] p. 34). Moreover, in such devices it is com-
mon to have fuel and (primary) air streams mixing and reacting
with each other in a recirculation zone, from which products of com-
bustion arise and keep burning downstream with air supplied
through (secondary and dilution) holes [3,4]. This presence of multi-
ple flow streams occurs in augmentors of turbofan engines as well
[4,5]. Augmentors also must function over wide operating regimes,
ranging from takeoff to accelerations at high altitude [6]. These wide
operating regimes pose a formidable challenge to estimate whether
the flame gets stabilized or blown off. Such an estimation is also
important in scramjets, where it is particularly difficult because the
ambient flow is supersonic and the flame stabilization occurs in
some small subsonic regions [7,8]. Since having a flame blown-off in
mid-flight is dangerous, the design of ignition systems that re-stabi-
lize it is important, such as plasma-induced systems [9]. In addition,
the wide operating regimes over which augmentors and ramjets
operate, together with the fact that the acoustic losses tend to be
low [10], make them prone to potentially dangerous thermoacoustic
combustion instabilities. Another feature of the combustion environ-
ment in devices such as aero-turbine engines, augmentors, and
scramjets is that, due to high flow speeds and concomitant high lev-
els of turbulent fluctuations, it is likely for the combustion to occur
near or in distributed-reaction-like regimes (cf. Section 2). Such
regimes are also of practical relevance to other combustion systems,
such as industrial lean-premixed gas turbines [11]. Furthermore,
high speeds may lead to flow-induced compressions and expansions
of the order of the heat-release from combustion. Hence, since all
these phenomena are coupled, it is also likely for such fluid-mechan-
ical-induced phenomena to enhance the combustion (cf. Section 2).
These processes are vividly exemplified by the interaction of flames
and shocks in scramjets (cf. Secs. 4(cid:1)7). This potential enhancement
of the combustion may also be produced by high levels of viscous
heating near walls at high speeds (cf. Sections 4.2 and 5.4), unless
some strong cooling is applied to the walls, in which case the com-
bustion is quenched. Lastly, physics that are not associated with one
device but are with another one, such as a lack of flame/shock inter-
actions in aero-turbine engines or ramjets (at design conditions) but
presence of them in scramjets, must be considered in the simulation
of the type of hybrid propulsion platforms [7,12,13] that are envi-
sioned to operate over wide regimes of speeds.

PThe above examples demonstrate that the combustion environ-
ment in propulsion systems involves some or all of the following
physics (the citations denote D
Xies): multiphase
phenomena [14,15]; partial-premixing [16]; multiple flow streams;
flame extinction, reignition and blowoff [17(cid:1)19]; ignition [20,21];

Xrepresentative studD

Pflame-wall interactions [22]; thermoacoustic combustion instabil-
ities [23]; distributed-reaction-like combustion [24,25]; and, inter-
actions between combustion and strong flow compressions and
expansions [26,27], as well as phenomena not mentioned above
such as transcritical and supercritical phenomena in rocket engines,
turbulence/radiation interactions [28,29] and thermal nonequilib-
rium [30]. Among all these phenomena, the concern of the present
work is on two sets of physics that perhaps have received less atten-
tion: distributed-reaction-like combustion and interactions between
combustion and strong flow compressions and expansions. Such
physics are called from now on high-speed combustion. What is
meant by high-speed combustion is further discussed using various
examples in Section 2.

PThe physics just discussed span a wide range of scales in space-
time ranging from those related to molecular interactions to those
corresponding to the largest flow structures. Modeling such physics
is usually done along the lines of addressing two questions. The first
one is: How to model molecular interactions in the framework of
continuum mechanics and do so in a computationally affordable
way? Once this first question is addressed, one can tackle: How to
model in continuum mechanics the interaction between turbulence,
chemistry and other phenomena such as droplet evaporation and
strong flow compressions and expansions in a computationally
affordable way? The concern of the present paper is addressing this
second question. Furthermore, this is done in the context of practical
engineering applications where it is unlikely that “enough” of the
relevant spatio-temporal scales are being resolved with the compu-
tational mesh, as further discussed in Section 3. To address this sec-
ond question various techniques are available. They include
Reynolds-Averaged-Navier(cid:1)Stokes (RANS) techniques [31], large-
eddy simulations (LES) [32], detached-eddy simulations [33], scale-
adaptive simulations (SAS) [34] (which can be classified as a type of
RANS), the partially-averaged-Navier(cid:1)Stokes model [35], the par-
tially-integrated-transport model [36], and the temporally-and-par-
tially-integrated-transport model, among others. With these
techniques, the problem of addressing the second question can be
recast into the problem of modeling a series of unclosed terms in the
model conservation equations. Section 3 discusses briefly these clo-
sure problems and explains which of them are of main interest for
the present paper. This is done in the context of the two most popu-
lar techniques: RANS and LES. However, regardless of which closure
problem is addressed, a central model is that which approximates
the interactions between turbulence and chemistry. Such a model is
called a turbulent combustion model.

[51,52];

PThere are many turbulent-combustion models. A partial
list
includes: flamelet models [1,37(cid:1)39]; conditional moment closure
[40,41]; conditional source estimation [42(cid:1)44]; transported proba-
bility density function (TPDF) [45(cid:1)48]; linear-eddy model (LEM)
[49,50]; one-dimensional-turbulence (ODT) model
the
eddy-dissipation-concept (EDC) model [53]; the partially-stirred-
reactor (PaSR) model [54,55]; the thickened-flame model [56(cid:1)58];
homogenization-based LES [59]; unsteady flame embedding [60];
and data-driven turbulent combustion models [61,62]. Furthermore,
the literature on turbulent-combustion models is vast. It includes
books [1,63(cid:1)65] and general review papers [2,66(cid:1)71].
It also
includes reviews centered around particular topics: LES [72(cid:1)74];
premixed systems [75]; partially-premixed systems [16]; gas-tur-
bine engines [76,77]; piston engines [78]; and, propulsion devices
[79(cid:1)83], among others. Most of this literature focuses on low-speed
flow environments, which is not surprising since these environ-
ments are relevant to most combustion devices. Therefore, consider-
ing the present interest on high-speed combustion, Sections 5(cid:1)7
address the following question: What are the challenges when
applying a particular model to the problem of high-speed combus-
tion? This question is addressed by analyzing the basic assumptions
of the model. In the context of propulsion systems, which is the

Ppresent interest, this approach has been taken by recent critical
studies [79,81(cid:1)83], Ref. [83] being the more in-depth. The present
study, however, differs on its emphasis on high-speed combustion
and on complementing the analysis of the basic assumptions with a
study of the comparisons between model predictions and measure-
ments of high-speed-combustion problems. Therefore, only models
for which such results are available are considered. These models
are flamelet models, TPDF, and LEM and ODT. EDC and PaSR could
also have been included by this criteria and excluding them is only
done for brevity. Moreover, the simulation results considered
include, if available, the following flow problems: supersonic jet
flames; reacting flows in scramjet-like geometries; premixed flames
near the distributed-reaction-zone regime; and, to less extent, the
interactions of flames with shocks. These studies are summarized in
Table 1.

PThus the present paper attempts to address the following ques-
tions with an interest on practical simulations of propulsion devices:

P1. What is meant here by high-speed combustion (Section 2)?

2. High-speed combustion

PThe reacting jet-in-crossflow (JICF) is a canonical problem that
has the features of what is called here high-speed combustion. Fig. 1
shows the JICF of Gamba et al. [112,143]. Fuel is injected perpendicu-
larly from the bottom wall of a channel (at xD0 in Fig. 1) into a
supersonic crossflow. The jet penetration blocks the oncoming cross-
flow, leading to a three-dimensional (3D) bow shock and other com-
plex shock structures denoted in Fig. 1 (top frame). This blockage
also produces a small recirculation region upstream of the injection
point and a large wake downstream. It is in these low-speed regions

Pwhere flame stabilization can happen. In particular, notice in Fig. 1
(bottom frame) the intense burning upstream of the injection point,
the burning at some distance downstream and near the wall, and
burning in the shear layer between the wake and the ambient flow.
Based on a study of OH images such as those shown in Fig. 1, Gamba
et al. notices that the OH appears in the form of broad and diffuse
regions near the wall, and as thin and long regions at the shear layer.
With this information, they conclude that the former regions corre-
spond to the broad reaction zones of premixed or nonpremixed
combustion, while the latter resemble thin-reaction zones of non-
premixed combustion [112]. Furthermore, through a similar analy-
sis, they conclude that ignition occurs intermittently upstream of
the jet. In other words, their JICF consists of a reaction region span-
ning different modes of combustion. Since the work of Gamba et al.
[112] it has become evident that their observations apply to the gen-
eral problem of high-speed combustion.

PSimulation studies show, through calculations of the flame index
[144], that at least in some portions of high-speed flames partial-
premixing occurs [27,84,89,145,146]. For example, consider the
supersonic jet flame considered in the DNS study of Luo et al. [27]. It
is called supersonic because the Mach number defined with the jet
exit velocity and a reference sound speed is greater than one. In this
particular jet flame, the Mach number of the coflow is much less
than one. As a result, the intense shear generated leads to strong tur-
bulent fluctuations. That such intense mixing does lead to pockets of
premixed-combustion regions can be seen in Fig. 2 which plots the
heat-release rate, _q; conditioned on flame index, FI. FI is defined as
the normalized product of the gradient of fuel and the gradient of
oxidizer. In this way, FI > 0 in premixed regions, and FI < 0 in non-
premixed regions. This identifies portions where combustion is not
occurring, i.e. where _q is low in Fig. 2. Therefore, an inspection of
Fig. 2 shows that this supersonic flame exhibits both premixed and
nonpremixed combustion. (In Fig. 2 FI(cid:3) D FI.)

PEvidence that distributed-reaction-like zones may occur in por-
tions of a high-speed flame is given by flame-visualization studies
such as that by Gamba et al. [112,143] discussed above. Another
example could be the study of a reacting and subsonic JICF by Micka
et al. [147] that documents flames that are not continuous but shred-
ded. Further evidence includes observations of autoignition regions
in some JICFs [147,148] and supersonic jet flames [84] which,
together with the supposition that autoignition leads to distributed-
reaction-like regions [149], suggests that such flows do exhibit dis-
tributed-reaction-like zones. Nonetheless, perhaps the strongest

locations in the supersonic jet flame of the DNS of Luo et al. [27]. This is Fig. 4a of
Ref. [27]. It is reprinted with permission from Elsevier.

Pevidence for the occurrence of these regions comes from recent
experiments [11,24,25,150,151] and DNS [152,153] on premixed
combustion that have indeed observed regions not resembling thin-
reaction zones at high-enough velocities, or more precisely high-
enough Karlovitz numbers, defined shortly. In fact, these results are
providing insight into how flames near or at the distributed-reaction
zone look.

PIt seems that these flames look like those shown in Fig. 3, which
is taken from the study of Dunn et al. [24] of piloted, natural-gas,
premixed flames. This study considers four types of flames denoted
PM1-50, PM1-100, PM1-150, and PM1-200, where the number fol-
lowing the dash denotes the jet exit velocity in m/s. The location of
these flames, as well as others discussed later, in the premixed flame
diagram of Peters [1] is indicated in Fig. 4 where ut and uf (lt and lf)
are respectively characteristic speeds (lengths) of the turbulent fluc-
tuations and the laminar flame. Fig. 4 also indicates hypothetical
regions for the distributed-reaction-zone (DRZ) and thin-reaction-
zone (TRZ) regimes. (Controversies regarding the form, limits or
transition regions between flame regions, and practical value of dia-
grams such as that in Fig. 4 are considered outside the present scope

[64,150,153,154].) The fact that the turbulence intensity is indeed
high in some of these flames is characterized by the high values

Pof the ratio ut/uf in Fig. 4, or by the fact that in such flames the
Karlovitz number, Ka, is high. This number is defined as the ratio
of time scales associated with the flame and the smallest scales of
the turbulence and varies from 100 to 3500 in the flames of Dunn
et al. Going back to Fig. 3, notice that the temperature gradient is
sharp in the lowest-speed flame, that it broadens as the jet speed
is increased, and that it is quite broad in the highest-speed flame
(PM1-200). Dunn et al. documents that while the PM1-50 flame is
flamelet-like, the PM1-200 does not show a well-defined reaction
layer. Moreover, as can be seen in Fig. 3, the high values of OH
near reaction regions characteristic of flamelet-like flames are not
seen in the PM1-200 flame. Another look into these distributed-
reaction-like regions is given by Fig. 5 from the comprehensive
experimental study by Zhou et al. [25] of premixed flames at con-
ditions indicated in Fig. 4 with dots. Fig. 5 shows the species pro-
files across a path through the flame for a flamelet-like flame at
Ka D 46 (top) and a distributed-reaction-like flame at Ka D 171
(bottom). Focusing on the CH profile, notice that that of the flame-
let-like flame is consistent with that of laminar flames, whereas
the CH profile of the distributed-reaction-like flame is very differ-
ent. Moreover, the absence of OH in the reaction zone shown in
Fig. 3 is also seen in Fig. 5. In another experimental study of labora-
tory premixed flames, Skiba et al. [151] not only documents obser-
vations of distributed-reaction-like zones similar to the above
ones, but finds that a single flame (i.e. a flame obtained for one set
of operating conditions of their burner) exhibits both flamelet-
like-regions, distributed-reaction-like regions, and regions in
between. In conclusion, these high-turbulence-intensity or high-
Ka premixed flames exhibit some regions with a flame structure
very different from that of a laminar flame.

Fig. 6. Heat release rate, _q; conditioned by the compressive power, Hc D ¡pð@ui=@xiÞ;
at different values of the mixture fraction in the supersonic jet flame of the DNS of
Luo et al. [27]. This is Fig. 5a of Ref. [27]. It is reprinted with permission from Elsevier.

Pthe compressive or expansive power, defined as Hc D ¡pð@ui=@xiÞ
with ui being the velocity field and p being pressure, is of the order
of the heat-release rate. The interaction between these strong flow
compressions and expansions with combustion is quantified for this
jet flame in Fig. 6. Fig. 6 plots the heat release conditioned on com-
pressive power versus a function of this compressive power defined
ðHcÞ D Hc log10ðjHcj C 1Þ = ðjHcj C 1Þ. flog 10(Hc) > 0 indicates
as f log10
flow compressions, and flog 10(Hc) < 0 denotes expansions. Notice in
Fig. 6 that in the flow-compression region the conditioned heat-
release rate increases with increasing (moving in the positive
flog 10(Hc) direction) compressive power. Also note that in the flow-
expansion region the conditioned heat-release rate increases with
increasing (moving in the negative flog 10(Hc) direction) expansive
power. Thus, both flow compressions and flow expansions seem to
enhance the rate of combustion. The former is intuitive, but the lat-
ter one is not (perhaps compressions are enhancing combustion
which in turn causes expansion). Therefore, it would be interesting
to further study these results. In view of such coupling between
combustion and strong flow compressions and expansions, it should
not be surprising that the structure of these supersonic flames is
unlike that of their low-speed counterparts. One example is given in
Fig. 7 which shows highly-resolved LES-PaSR results from Moule
et al. [84] for the supersonic hydrogen-vitiated-air jet flame of Cheng
et al. [85,160]. By high-resolution it is meant here that an attempt is
made to capture most of the relevant physical scales by using LES
with a very fine mesh [84]. Moule et al. shows that the flame anchors
at the beginning of a shock diamond, as can be seen in Fig. 7 (but
more clearly in their Fig. 24). Furthermore, they show that in the sta-
bilization zone, 18 < x/d < 26, there are regions where the product
of the gradients of pressure and those of heat release is large, indicat-
ing a strong correlation between flow compressions/expansions and
combustion, similar to that in the discussion of Fig. 6. However, as
indicated in Fig. 7, Moule et al. also demonstrates that, unlike a low-
speed nonpremixed flame, the heat release maxima (red regions) do
not coincide with the stoichiometric isoline (white line). Thus, the
structure of high-speed flames can differ from that of low-speed
flames.

PAnother interesting flame structure is seen by Poludnenko [155].
He considers high-resolution implicit LES of a series of high-speed,
unconfined, premixed flames in the flamelet regime propagating in
homogeneous turbulence. Poludnenko defines high-speed for this
problem as values of the turbulent flame speed, ST, larger than the

Fig. 5. Spatial profiles of species across the flame front for premixed flamelet-like
flames (top) and distributed-reaction-like flames (bottom) measured in the experi-
ments of Zhou et al. [25]. This is Fig. 13 of Ref. [25]. It is reprinted with permission
from Elsevier.

PIt can be hypothesized that, because there is a larger overlap of
the scales of turbulence and combustion in distributed-reaction
zones than in thin-reaction zones, the role of the scales of combus-
tion on the features of the turbulence is more important in the for-
mer than in the latter. In other words, the widely held assumption
that turbulence and combustion scales are well-separated, which is
discussed further at the end of Section 3, may not be the case for the
modeling of distributed-reaction-like zones. However, the DNS
study of Kolla et al. [156] indicates that combustion scales may be
important in describing the turbulence even in the thin-reaction-
zone regime. This study considers premixed flames, with conditions
denoted in Fig. 4, interacting with shear-layer-generated turbulence.
Kolla et al. takes considerable care in defining a density-weighted
turbulence spectrum because of the challenge of computing such
spectra in premixed flames [158]. Fig. 9 in the paper of Kolla et al.
shows that only by using the laminar-flame thickness instead of the
Kolmogorov length the density-weighted turbulence spectrum col-
lapses in the high-wave-number region. Such a collapse indicates
that combustion scales should be used to describe the turbulence
around flames. How general this conclusion is needs further verifica-
tion in other setups, including those using fuels other than hydrogen.
PReturning to the JICF of Gamba et al. [112,143], notice in Fig. 1
that the shock structure sits near the burning regions. Thus, it
appears unlikely for compressions and expansions and their poten-
tial interaction with combustion to be irrelevant. That such pro-
cesses are relevant has been demonstrated for the jet flame of Luo
et al. [27], discussed above. Jin et al. [159] (their Fig. 5) shows that

Pspeed of the Chapman-Jouguet deflagration, SCJ [161]. Fig. 8 shows
the temporal variations of different normalized quantities for one
particular case, indicated in Fig. 4, in which excursions of ST larger
than SCJ are observed. All quantities are averages over the flame-
brush volume and in Fig. 8 they are normalized by their maximum
values. Figure 8 shows that an increase in burning rate, quantified by
the turbulent flame speed (black line), is followed shortly by an
increase of pressure (red line). This process is in turn followed by the
formation of large pressure gradients (not shown), and an increase
of the baroclinic torque term in the vorticity equation (blue line
denotes a component normal to the flame-propagation direction).
Before continuing, the reader is reminded that in the vorticity equa-
tion the rate of change of vorticity is balanced by three terms: pro-
duction via velocity strain, effect of flow compressions or
expansions, and the baroclinic torque, the last one of which is pro-
duced by the misalignment of the gradients of pressure and density.
Poludnenko documents that, among these terms, the baroclinic tor-
que is the dominant one for the conditions discussed here. Thus, the

line) and baroclinic-torque term (blue line), Btorque, in the vorticity equation for the
premixed flame of the simulation of Poludnenko [155]. All quantities are normalized
and Btorque includes only one of the components normal to the flame propagation. This
is adapted from Fig. 5 of Ref. [155]. (For interpretation of the references to color in
this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

Plarge increase of the baroclinic-torque term shown in Fig. 8 results
in the production of a lot of vorticity and, thus, turbulence. As a
result, as can be seen in Fig. 8, after some larger time delay the burn-
ing rate increases again from the action of turbulence, repeating the
cycle. Thus, combustion causes turbulence via baroclinicity which
enhances combustion and so on. This process leads to a limit cycle
which Poludnenko calls a pulsating instability. It is not seen at low-
speeds because, in part, in such cases the baroclinic torque term is
seen to be negligible (cf. Fig. 6 in Poludnenko). Such mechanism of
turbulence generation is akin to that in the Richtmyer(cid:1)Meshkov
instability [162] and in flame-generated turbulence [158]. However,
it differs in the fact that the pressure gradient is not externally
imposed but generated by the flame propagation. Overall, as in the
study of Moule et al. [84] of supersonic jet flames discussed above,
Poludnenko shows physics and a flame structure markedly different
from typical premixed low-speed flames. It remains to be seen,
though, if the results by Poludnenko are also observed in more-prac-
tically relevant confined flames, or in distributed-reaction-like
flames where the role of the baroclinic torque can be speculated to
be smaller because the gradients of thermochemical quantities are

vivid example on how the physics of high-speed flames can be dif-
ferent from those at low speeds. Another example is given by the
next unexplained result.

POchs et al. [157] considers the propagation of premixed flame
kernels in grid turbulence at the conditions indicated in Fig. 4, which
correspond to the thin-reaction-zone regime. The unique feature of
these experiments is that they are conducted in a supersonic wind
tunnel, at a bulk Mach number of 1.5. Ochs et al. observes that their
high-speed flame kernels grow at a rate comparable to that of low-
speed flame kernels. However, they also observed strong local flame
quenching in their flame kernels, not observed in low-speed flows.
These observations lead to the hypothesis that at high-speed flows
there are mechanisms of flame generation and destruction that are
not relevant at low speeds. This issue is under investigation.

PKolla et al. [156] shows how combustion can have an effect on
the turbulence near the flame, as discussed above. The DNS study of
Luo [26] goes further. Luo considers supersonic nonreacting and
reacting jets and evaluates different terms in the budget of the Rey-
nolds stress and of the turbulent kinetic energy. Luo finds that the
Reynolds stress is anisotropic in the nonreacting case and, more
interestingly, that the level of anisotropy is decreased by the effect
of combustion, which is quantified by considering two reacting cases

Pgiving different levels of total heat release. The above study of Polud-
nenko [155] also observes an effect of heat release on the turbulence
anisotropy. Luo also documents that the pressure(cid:1)dilatation term in
the turbulent-kinetic-energy equation, which quantifies the effect of
flow compressions and expansions on the turbulence, is negligible in
the nonreacting case, consistent with another DNS study of a mildly-
reacting jet [163]. However, Luo observes that the values of the pres-
sure(cid:1)dilatation term are of the order of the shear-production term
in the reacting cases, and that they increase when going from the
low- to the high-total-heat-release case. It would be interesting to
see how the results from more recent DNS databases, such as those
from Luo et al. [27] and Jin et al. [159], compare with the analysis of
Luo [26].

PAs a last example of the potential effect of combustion and flow
compressions and expansions on the turbulence itself consider the
simulation studies of shock-flame interactions reviewed by Oran &
Gamezo [164]. They observe that several metrics obtained from 2D
simulations are in satisfactory agreement with experiments and cor-
responding 3D simulations. This result is counter-intuitive. In view
of it, they propose that an unusual type of turbulence is generated in
this type of problems. They propose that this turbulence results
from the repeated interaction of a flame with a shock leading to vor-
ticity being generated via baroclinicity over a broad range of scales,
from flame length-scales to device length-scales. Further confirma-
tion or study of such a hypothesis is, however, pending. Therefore,
various simulation studies point towards the possibility of an effect
of combustion on the features of the turbulence.

PThe discussion of the present section leads to the following

conclusions:

P(cid:4) The combustion regions of present interest have non-premixed
and premixed zones, they span multiple combustion regimes
including distributed-reaction-like combustion, and have signif-
icant interactions between combustion and strong flow com-
pressions and expansions.

P(cid:4) The turbulence in these combustion regions is affected by com-
bustion and flow compressions and expansions and appears to
have some different features from nonreacting, low-speed tur-
bulence.

P(cid:4) These are the characteristics of what is meant here by high-
speed combustion and they lead to a more complex picture than
the classic picture of mixing-controlled combustion posed by
Ferri in the seventies [165].

PThese conclusions raise the following questions: Do these physics
need to be included into current models? Are the basic assumptions
of current turbulent-combustion models consistent with the above
observations? The first question is addressed in Section 4 and the
second one in Secs. 5(cid:1)7. However, before addressing these ques-
tions, the closure problems of turbulence modeling are briefly dis-
cussed next.

3. The closure problems

PThe form of the filtered conservation equations of LES and the
ensemble-averaged conservation equations of RANS for reacting
flows is similar [64], although not identical. Thus, the following uses
the LES equations to briefly discuss the closure problems. The reader
is referred elsewhere for comprehensive discussions of the LES
[64,73] and RANS [161] equations. From now on, the term average is
used rather than ensemble-average or filter only with the purpose of
simplifying discussions referring to both LES and RANS, but note
that filtering is not the same as averaging because it is a more gen-
eral operation.

PThe flow of interest is gaseous, compressible, multi-species, and

reacting. In LES it is governed by

; and Tsgs

PThe problem of turbulent combustion can be viewed as the prob-
lem of closing all the unclosed terms in Eqs. (3.1)(cid:1)(3.5), which are
defined and summarized in Table 2. In LES these terms can be
thought as representing the effect of subgrid-scale physics on the
large-scale physics, while in RANS they represent the effect of turbu-
lent fluctuations on the mean flow. Thus there are two levels of
description: In LES these are called here the LES or large-scale or
average level, and the subgrid or subgrid-scale level, and in RANS
these are called the RANS or mean or average level, and the fluctuat-
ing level. Therefore, in other words, LES needs models for the inter-
action of various physical phenomena at the subgrid level, while
RANS needs this at the fluctuating level. How to close all of the terms
in Table 2 is amply discussed elsewhere for low-speed flows [1,64],
and discussed in the context of flows where acoustic waves and
strong flow compressions and expansions cannot be neglected in
Sankaran & Merkle [167], in the present issue of PECS. Therefore, the
present paper focuses on the closure of the average chemical source
term with turbulent combustion models and, due to the emphasis
on high-speed combustion, on the relationship between such

in the species equation, Eq. (3.4), can be closed explicitly or its clo-
sure replaced by computing the species mass fractions. In either
case turbulent combustion models such as the ones discussed in
Sections 5(cid:1)7 are needed. The high-speed source term enters the
governing equations at the two levels discussed above. At the LES or
RANS level, the high-speed source term appears in the averaged

Physically, the term ¡pð@ui=@xiÞ and its counterpart in Eq. (3.6) rep-
resent the heating or cooling of fluid via compression or expansion,
while the term tij(@ui/@xj) and its counterpart in Eq. (3.6) represent
viscous heating. These phenomena can be neglected at low-speeds
but not in high-speed combustion, cf. Section 2. For this reason, Shspd
is called a high-speed source term throughout this document. A
caveat with this terminology, however, is that the term p@ui/@xi plays
a critical role in low-speed flows where thermoacoustics are impor-
e
tant.
Shspd and Shspd can be computed in any of the following four
ways, cf. Table 3:

P3. A more complete treatment than the one above is not to neglect
(cid:2)sgs and Psgs and account for the subgrid or turbulent viscous
heating and pressure(cid:1)dilatation by making them functions of
the LES or RANS quantities.

P4. An alternative to the above is to compute (cid:2)sgs and Psgs by taking
advantage of some feature of the turbulent combustion model.

PThe discussion of the fourth approach is deferred until the analysis
of the only current formulation of a turbulent combustion model that
allows to use this approach, cf. Sections 7.4 and 7.5. The third one
requires models for the subgrid pressure(cid:1)dilatation term and subgrid
viscous heating. To illustrate the challenges in using existing models,
consider the pressure(cid:1)dilatation model of Zeman [168] and a varia-
tion of its original derivation. Say that (a) all species have the same
heat capacity independent of temperature. With this assumption,
which can be relaxed, the following energy-conservation equation
with pressure as the energy variable can be obtained ([64] p. 24):

where g is the ratio of heat capacities, _vT is a heat source from chemi-

Furthermore, (b) neglect the molecular heat flux. In RANS, an equation
for the pressure(cid:1)dilatation term, p0@iu0
; can be obtained by using the

decomposition f D f C f 0 in Eq. (3.8), with f representing any flow vari-
able and the overbar an average, and then averaging the resulting
equation. A similar process can be conducted in the context of LES but
it is not considered here. Again for simplification purposes, it is
assumed that (c) 1=p (cid:5) 1=p; and (d) that f D f and f 0 D 0. With these
considerations, the following equation is obtained:

Pwhich says that pressure fluctuations relax towards an equilibrium
value pe on the acoustic timescale ta. Zeman makes various consid-
erations to find forms for pe and ta, a critical one being to assume
that (j) the turbulent Mach number is not too large. At this point it
should be evident that developing models for terms such as the pres-
sure(cid:1)dilatation is far from being trivial, and that many assumptions
are needed to obtain simple models such as that given by Eq. (3.10).
The same applies for the LES model of Ristorcelli [169], but here only
its main result is given:

where apd is a model constant, and Msgs is a turbulent Mach number
defined as the ratio of the subgrid kinetic energy and a reference
sound speed. As in Zeman’s model, the flow is nonreacting and the
turbulent Mach number is assumed to be small. These two assump-
tions are also taken in the Psgs-model of Sarkar et al. [170] and the
(cid:2)sgs-model of Sarkar [171]. Therefore, the application of these mod-
els requires to ignore the coupling between combustion and flow
compressions and expansions discussed in Section 2, shown in
Figs. 6 and 8. Not surprisingly, as discussed later, the preferred
approach is to not model the subgrid or fluctuating level interaction
between combustion, flow compressions and expansions, and vis-
cous heating, but assume that it is sufficient to capture these phe-
nomena with the computational mesh,
following the second
approach of Table 3 where Psgs D (cid:2)sgs D 0.

PViscous heating happens at time and length scales dictated by
viscous processes not intended to be captured with a computational
mesh in LES or RANS. Hence, it is reasonable to say that these phe-
nomena need modeling. Moreover, the pressure(cid:1)dilatation term
near shocks and shocklets may involve scales that cannot be
resolved with the mesh, forcing the need to model these terms. (The
characteristic length of a shock is the mean free path. However,
direct-numerical-simulation studies of nonreacting flows show that
their effect on the turbulence extends over length scales within the
inertial range [172].) Furthermore, even if one refines the mesh to a
degree that most of the relevant physics are captured, as done for
example in the studies of Moule et al. [84] and Poludnenko [155] dis-
cussed in Section 2, such fine meshes used in academic setups are
unlikely to be used for practical propulsion systems in the near
future, or for the parametric studies used in the design stage of such
devices. This issue is revisited later in the context of the no-model
approach at the end of Section 4.2. All this points to the need to
develop closure models for the subgrid and fluctuating pressur-
e(cid:1)dilatation and viscous heating terms that are valid for high-speed
reacting flows. However, as discussed in the following, there are no
empirical results to support these arguments. Thus, the need to
model these terms is left as an open question. Nonetheless, this dis-
cussion also points to a more fundamental problem in modeling
high-speed combustion.

PThe closure problem of turbulent combustion, i.e., modeling all
the terms in Table 2, traditionally assumes that the scales of the tur-
bulence are separated enough from those relevant to combustion
[1]. This scale-separation assumption allows to use the many models
for the terms in Table 2 developed for nonreacting flows and applied
them with no changes to reacting flows [64]. In other words, for
example, an eddy-viscosity model used to close the subgrid or fluc-
tuating stress, tsgs
; does not need to explicitly take into account
ij
combustion. Likewise, such an eddy-viscosity model can be used to
represent the turbulence assumed by a given turbulent combustion
model. In this way, the combustion happening at the subgrid or fluc-
tuating level affects the turbulent flow only through its impact on
the resolved fields. In other words, there is no direct link between
turbulence and combustion, and the strong flow compressions and
expansions of interest here as well, at the subgrid level in LES or

Pfluctuating level in RANS. This practice is convenient because it can
rely on the large amount of models developed for nonreacting flows.
However, unless a fine-enough mesh is used, this practice disregards
the close coupling between flow compressions and expansions and
combustion seen in Fig. 6; the turbulence anisotropy induced by
such flow compressions and expansions seen by Poludnenko [155]
and Luo [26]; the effect of the baroclinic torque seen by Poludnenko
[155]; and, the importance of the combustion scales documented by
Kolla et al. [156], among other results discussed in Section 2, as well
as the arguments given in the previous paragraph. Moreover, in the
context of LES, such potential effect of combustion on turbulence
neglects the observed energy transfer from small to large scales, so-
called back-scatter, in the flame brush of a subsonic premixed flame
seen in a recent DNS [173]. It is important to note that, unlike obser-
vations in mildly reacting flows [163] where there is instantaneous
back-scatter but its mean is near zero, the mean back-scatter docu-
mented by this DNS study of premixed flames is significant. This
issue of back-scatter in LES simulations of combustion problems is
further discussed in Sankaran & Merkle [167] (in the present issue of
PECS). Of course, one can always use a fine-enough grid to resolve all
relevant scales but, as already discussed, this is impractical in the
near term. However, to the authors’ knowledge, there are no avail-
able studies on the effect of using models that take into account the
direct effect of combustion on turbulence for the unclosed terms in
Table 2. Therefore, again, the need for these models is left as an open
question. Thus, in the following, the discussion is limited to indicat-
ing where in its formulation a particular model invokes the assump-
tion of a turbulence unaffected by combustion. Note, however, that
there is only one model that as currently formulated does not use
this assumption, cf. Section 7.

The use of this approach can be justified in either of two ways. One
way, in the context of LES or RANS, is to assume that the characteris-
tic time-scales of the chemical kinetics are significantly larger than
those of the turbulent mixing to make the chemistry and not the tur-
bulent mixing the rate-limiting process [64]. In other words, the
interaction between combustion and turbulence discussed in
Section 2 happening at the subgrid (LES) or fluctuating (RANS) level
is ignored. Another way to justify the use of Eq. (4.1), which is per-
haps more physically sound, and used mainly in the context of LES,
is to assume that most of the relevant spatio-temporal scales to pre-
dict observables of interest are being resolved. This justification may
also apply to unsteady RANS models that do allow for some spatio-
temporal resolution, such as SAS. The verification that enough scales
are being resolved can be done with a priori estimates of the physical
scales involved or, more convincingly, by studying the effect of the
mesh refinement on the observables of interest. With this second
justification, the key problem to address is whether the required
mesh can be used for practical applications. Since turbulence-chem-
istry interactions are being neglected at the subgrid level in LES or
fluctuating level in RANS, it further makes sense to neglect the inter-
actions between turbulence, combustion and flow compressions and
expansions at the subgrid (LES) or fluctuating (RANS) levels by zero-
ing the subgrid or fluctuating pressure(cid:1)dilatation and viscous-

Pheating terms in the average high-speed source term, cf. Eq. (3.6). In
fact, this approach is used by all the studies discussed in Section 4.2.
The undeniable advantage of the no-model approach is evident by
comparing its formulation given by Eq. (4.1) with the formulations
of the models in Sections 5(cid:1)7: The no-model approach is much sim-
pler. Therefore, it is useful to address: How accurate are the predic-
tions of the no-model or quasi-laminar-chemistry approach?

4.2. Discussion

PSupersonic jet flames, such as the one of Cheng et al. [85] shown
in Fig. 7, usually exhibit lift-off. This is a phenomenon that has tradi-
tionally posed a challenge to turbulent-combustion models [1,64],
although it has been well captured by modern models in some sub-
sonic problems [174(cid:1)177]. Therefore, it is interesting to see how
well the no-model approach performs in these types of flames. For
this purpose, Fig. 9 shows the spatial variation of mean temperature
predicted by various simulations. The first four frames from top in
Fig. 9 show radial variations at different streamwise locations, and
the fifth frame shows the streamwise variation at the centerline.
Mobus et al. [124] uses RANS and a seven-step chemical mechanism.
They find that at the centerline and in the flame stabilization region,
18 < x/d < 26 in Fig. 7 and second frame from top in Fig. 9, the tem-
perature is underpredicted by O(100) K in comparison with the
experiments. Mobus et al. also finds temperature underpredictions
of O(100) K all throughout at a downstream measurement plane
(not shown in Fig. 9 but shown later on in Fig. 20). Boivin et al. [86]
uses implicit LES (which zeroes all terms with the superscript sgs in
Table 2) and finds considerable improvements over the predictions
of Mobus et al., as can be seen in Fig. 9. However, the simulations of
Boivin et al. also give a flame much narrower than those in the
experiments, which is evident in the third and fourth frames from
top in Fig. 9. This result is also seen by Mobus et al., cf. Fig. 20 (bot-
tom). It is intriguing to note that the LES-PaSR simulation of Moule
et al. [84], also shown in Fig. 9 (denoted as present study), shows
overall a better accuracy than those using the no-model approach.
Tentatively, it can be argued that such enhanced predictions are the
result of using the PaSR model rather than the no-model approach.
However, considering the LES simulations only, this is not the case
because the mesh used by Moule et al. has 31M predominantly hexa-
hedral cells and includes the injector while that of Boivin et al. has
6.6M tetrahedral cells and does not include the injector. Thus, Moule
et al. is resolving a larger range of scales and, perhaps more impor-
tantly, using a more realistic inflow for their jet flame. However,
even by doing so their predictions for mean temperature further
downstream degrade considerably in comparison with those
upstream, as can be seen in the fourth frame from top in Fig. 9.
Therefore, the no-model approach provides fair predictions for the
jet of Cheng et al. [85] and its inaccuracies may be partly due to the
unrealistic inflow used by Mobus et al. and Boivin et al.

PAnother supersonic jet flame is the hydrogen-vitiated-air wall jet
of Burrows et al. [88]. Engblom et al. [87] uses RANS and a eight-step
chemical mechanism. They report overall good predictions of the
mean temperature and major species profiles. They also observe
that the ignition location, denoted by a peak in the mean tempera-
ture profile, is more accurately predicted by using a closure for the
Reynolds stress (equivalent to tsgs
in Table 2) that takes into account
ij
fluctuating flow compressions and expansions in comparison with a
closure that does not. Thus, in this particular case, making the model
more consistent with the physics at hand appears to make it more
accurate. Nonetheless, the sensitivity of their results to the inflow
conditions, and to the turbulent Prandtl number is as large, if not
larger, than that to the type of Reynolds-stress model. Edwards et al.
[89] uses hybrid LES-RANS simulations with seven-step or nine-step
chemical mechanisms and documents predictions of comparable
accuracy to those of Engblom et al. with the exception of an

Punderprediction (about 20%) of temperature and the mass fraction
of fuel near the reaction zone not seen in the data of Engblom et al.
Such underpredictions remain for different domain types and chem-
ical mechanisms. These two sets of results are counterintuitive since
one would have expected LES-RANS to be more accurate than simply
RANS. Edwards et al. explains their underpredictions to be poten-
tially due to unknown details of the nozzle used in the experiments,
an explanation which is consistent to the sensitivity to the inflow
seen by Engblom et al. (cf., also Ref. [178]). Nonetheless, in spite of
these underpredictions, the no-model predictions for the wall jet of
Burrows et al. are more accurate than those discussed above for the
jet flame of Cheng et al. [85]. They are also sensitive to models other
than turbulent-combustion models.

titative comparisons with experimental results usually do so for the

Xet al. [90]D

Pstreamwise variation of the wall pressure, which is indeed an impor-
tant observable since it is related to thrust. One of such studies is
that of Moule D
Xwho uses RANS with a nineteen-step chemi-
cal mechanism to simulate the U-Queensland REST scramjet [91]. In
this scramjet hydrogen is injected into a main crossflow, although
not perpendicularly, and cavities and struts are not used for flame
stabilization. Moule D
Xet al. obtains fairly accurate predictions for the
wall pressure with both the no-model and PaSR model, indicating a
lack of sensitivity of the turbulence modeling. Kumaran et al. [92]
uses RANS with a one-step mechanism for kerosene to simulate the
IIT scramjet, which relies on multiple struts for flame stabilization.
They predict wall pressures slightly lower than the experimental
ones in a nonreacting test, and considerably lower in a reacting test
in particular near the flame-stabilization region. Thus, since their
nonreacting predictions are good, such unsatisfactory predictions in
the reacting case are likely due to the combustion modeling. Eng-
blom et al. [87] conducts RANS with a three-step mechanism for eth-
ylene for the cavity-stabilized ICR combustor [93] and, unlike the
experiments, predicts unstart. (Unstart is an undesirable condition
in which the pressure in the combustor is large enough in relation to
that at the inlet to push the shock train inside the isolator, which is
the duct between the inlet and the combustion region, towards the
inlet.) D
XMoreover, Engblom et al. finds that even at Mach numbers
lower than those of the experiments their simulations overpredict
significantly (by up to about 35%) the wall pressure. In contrast with
these unsatisfactory predictions in strut- or cavity-stabilized com-
bustion in scramjets, Berglund et al. [94] uses LES and documents
good predictions for the wall pressure in the wedge-stabilized com-
bustion in the NAL/ONERA/LAERTE scramjet [95] when using a
seven-step chemical mechanism for hydrogen. Moreover, Berglund
et al. finds that their wall-pressure predictions are nearly insensitive
to the use of either the no-model approach or the PaSR model.

PIn the problem considered by Moule at al [90]. (RANS) the flame
is stabilized by auto-ignition, as also observed in JICF studies such as
Ben Yakar et al. [148]. Hence the rate limiting process can be said to
be set by the chemical kinetics not the turbulent mixing. In contrast,
in the strut- and cavity-stabilized combustion problems of Kumaran
et al. [92] (RANS) and Engblom et al. [87] (RANS) the flame is most
likely stabilized in recirculation regions where the fluid mechanics
play an important role. From this point of view, it can be argued that
the no-model approach is seen to provide accurate predictions in
Moule D
Xet al. but not in Kumaran et al. and Engblom et al. because the
first involves a problem where there is chemistry-controlled com-
bustion, a central assumption of
the no-model approach as
explained above, while the last two involve combustion that is either
chemistry- or mixing-controlled. This argument is used by Moule at
al. when interpreting their results. In other words, accurate predic-
tions are obtained in problems where the no-model assumptions are
consistent with the physics at hand but not otherwise. However, this
argument, although reasonable, overlooks the fact that Moule D
Xet al.
uses a complex mechanism for hydrogen-air combustion, while
Kumaran et al. and Engblom et al. used global mechanisms for
hydrocarbon(cid:1)air combustion. The latter choice is inadequate to

Pobtain accurate predictions in problems where it is not clear if the
combustion is chemistry or mixing controlled, as happens in the
problems considered by Kumaran et al. and Engblom et al. (For sim-
ple hydrocarbons at least 20(cid:1)40 species may be needed [2].) More-
over, the above rate-limiting-process explanation also overlooks the
fact that, for a wedge-stabilized-combustion problem, Berglund
et al. [94] (LES) predicts well the wall pressure. Lastly, when viewing
the complex physics discussed in Section 2, arguing that the entire
flame-stabilization region is either chemistry-controlled or mixing-
controlled appears to be an oversimplification of the problem. Thus,
all that can be concluded from the no-model simulations of scram-
jet-like geometries discussed so far is that they predict wall pres-
sures fairly well when using complex chemical-kinetic models for
hydrogen(cid:1)air combustion but not when using global mechanisms
for hydrocarbon(cid:1)air combustion. However, the main problem with
these studies is that no experimental data other than wall pressure
is available. Such is not the case in the following ones.

PIn the DLR-wedge scramjet [97,98] hydrogen is injected at the
base of a wedge that sits midway between the top and bottom walls
of a divergent channel. In this setup, as Fig. 10 shows, the flame is
stabilized at some distance downstream of the wedge. It is useful to
divide this flame into three regions [100]: an induction zone right
downstream of the wedge where small vortical structures are seen;
a lean turbulent-combustion zone further downstream where large
vortical structures dominate; and a transition region in between.
Vertical profiles of axial velocity and temperature are available at
each of these regions, as well as measurements of the streamwise
variation of wall pressure. Fig. 11 shows the mean temperature pro-
files for the simulations that are discussed in the present work. As
evident from Fig. 11 a key advantage of considering the DLR-wedge
scramjet is that it allows to compare results from different turbu-
lent-combustion models. Referring to the no-model predictions,
Fig. 11 shows that the LES of Genin et al. [99], who used a seven-step
chemical mechanism, underpredicts the temperature by O(100) K in
the induction zone (xD11 mm), and overpredicts it further down-
stream. Furthermore, Genin et al. documents a broader wake than
that seen in the experiments, as can be seen in the xD58 and 156
mm stations. Potturi & Edwards [96] uses a LES-RANS hybrid model
with a nine-species chemical-kinetics model. Their simulations
underpredict mean temperatures at the induction zone (xD11 mm),
in a more pronounced way than Genin et al., overpredict them
downstream, but predict a wake width (as seen in the xD58 and 156
mm stations) in better agreement with experiments than that
obtained by Genin et al. Note that Potturi & Edwards uses 10 times
more cells than Genin et al. The prediction errors at the two down-
stream stations observed by Genin et al. and Potturi & Edwards can-
not be solely attributed to those from the turbulent-combustion
model since such type of result is strongly influenced by the wall
boundary conditions, apparently unknown from the experiments.
Furthermore, Genin et al. use of symmetry conditions at the wall is
unlikely to represent the actual setup, which may explain their
wider wake. In addition, it is interesting to note that among the sim-
ulations in Fig. 11 the one that better predicts the downstream

Fig. 11. Vertical profiles of mean temperature at three streamwise locations for the following studies (from top row to bottom row): Genin & Menon [99], Potturi & Edwards [96],
Oevermann [105], Berglund et al. [106], Zhouqin et al. [107], Genin & Menon [133]. The type of line denotes the type of simulation: no-model approach (black solid line), flamelet
(blue solid or dashed line), EBU (green solid line), LEM (red solid line). (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version
of this article.)

Pwake, that of Berglund et al. [106], uses wall functions that produce
enough viscous heating to increase the temperature near the walls,
which can be seen in Fig. 11. This good prediction of the wake is also
seen with the same near-wall treatment in another simulation using
PaSR [100] (not shown). (Potturi & Edwards also uses wall functions
but an increase of temperature at the walls similar to that in Ber-
glund et al. [106] cannot be seen in their Fig. 7.) Thus, it is likely that
the prediction errors observed by Genin et al. and Potturi & Edwards
at the two downstream stations are in part due to improper bound-
ary conditions which, again, seemed to be unknown from the experi-
ments. Therefore, these two no-model-approach studies show
nonnegligible discrepancies with experiments in the induction zone
of the DLR-wedge scramjet, and further discrepancies at down-
stream locations that may be produced by near-wall-modeling
errors. Later discussions address if these performances are enhanced
by the use of turbulent-combustion models.

PFulton et al. [101] simulates the UV-A scramjet [102] with a
hybrid LES-RANS approach. In this scramjet hydrogen is injected at
the base of a wall-mounted half-wedge in a divergent channel. This
geometry can be partially seen in the top frame of Fig. 12. The oper-
ating condition considered has a global equivalence ratio of 0.17.
Fulton et al. obtains an overall good prediction of the streamwise-
variation of mean wall pressure, with the largest discrepancy (about
15%) in the flame-stabilization region. Moreover, a comparison of
the top (experiments) and bottom (simulations) frames in Fig. 12
shows that Fulton et al. predicts a flame structure with fine-scale
features not seen in the experiments. (Fulton et al. [101] compares
experimental and simulation maps with great care by interpolating
the simulation data into the locations of the CARS experimental
measurements and then mapping both sets of data into a 200£ 200
grid for comparison.) Very likely this is due to the broadening of the
reaction zone by small flow structures not resolved (or modeled) in
the simulation. Furthermore, Fig. 13 shows that the simulations

Poverpredict the mean temperatures at some locations at three sta-
tions (especially near z=H D 0 and y=H D 1), and do so for two differ-
ent chemical mechanisms. Such an overprediction of temperatures
is also seen with the no-model approach by Chan et al. [108] as dis-
cussed in Section 5.4. Such temperature overpredictions include the
flame stabilization zone (x=H D 12). Fulton et al. explains that this
last result may be due to the stronger turbulent fluctuations in this
region in comparison to others (not shown here) which would sug-
gest a strong coupling between turbulence and combustion. With
the no-model approach and LES, this coupling is partly resolved with
the mesh, but not at the subgrid level. However, another source of
errors in temperature predictions, recognized by Fulton et al., is that
from artifacts introduced by the numerics. A mesh sensitivity study
would help to clarify this issue. As a last comment on the work by
Fulton et al., which is revisited later on, note that one set of simula-
tions (denoted as Jachimowski in Fig. 13) was conducted without
knowing any experimental results other than wall pressures [179],
making it effectively a blind test. Another experiment which pro-
vides detailed information about the combustion region is the
SCHOLAR scramjet combustor [104]. In this combustor hydrogen is
injected at an angle at the top wall of a divergent channel, in a way
that the combustion region is similar to that of a reacting JICF. Cocks
et al. [103] uses RANS with either a seven- or nineteen-step chemi-
cal-kinetics model to simulate the SCHOLAR combustor. They find
that their temperature predictions suggest an ignition occurring
closer to the injector than that seen in the experiments. Cocks et al.
argues that, since the ignition is induced by the shock, such disagree-
ment is due to the shock-capturing modeling. Cocks et al. also docu-
ments, as revealed by their maps of temperature, flames with thin
structures that contrast with the broad flames observed in the
experiments. Such a contrast is considerably more marked than that
observed by Fulton et al., just discussed. Lastly, Cocks et al. observes
that the above discrepancies between the no-model simulations and

Pexperiments are not enhanced by using instead a presumed-PDF tur-
bulent-combustion model. Overall, for two different scramjet-like
geometries, the studies of Fulton et al. and Cocks et al. predict tem-
peratures that disagree with those measured in experiments in a
nonnegligible way, in particular in the flame stabilization zone.
Moreover, both studies show finer flame structures than those seen
in the experiments. This discrepancy may be due to experimental
error, but it could also be due to the disregard by the no-model
approach of subgrid fluctuations in LES (Fulton et al.) or turbulent
fluctuations in general in RANS (Cocks et al.). This hypothesis is
addressed later on, when discussing the study of Chan et al. [108] in
Section 5. Nonetheless, it must be stressed that the predictions of
Fulton et al. are not unsatisfactory either, and that for one set of sim-
ulations they were obtained in a blind test. None of the studies con-
sidered in the remainder of the present paper document having
used blind tests.

PThe present discussion leads to the following conclusions:

P1. In scramjet-like problems where only the experimental wall
pressure is known, the no-model approach appears to predict
this metric accurately when used with complex chemical mech-
anisms [90,94,180] but not otherwise [87,92]. In high-speed-
combustion problems where experimental metrics about the
combustion
simulations
[86,87,89,96,99,108,124] (Ref. [108] is discussed later) give pre-
dictions that cannot be deemed unsatisfactory everywhere, and
two [103,126] (Ref. [126] is discussed later) show significant dis-
agreements with experiments everywhere. D

P2. Discrepancies between simulation predictions and measure-
ments cannot be solely attributed to errors from the no-model
approach because high-speed-combustion problems involve
other physics that are difficult to model, such as shocks and
near-wall phenomena. Furthermore, the experiments can be

Pquite complex and involve uncertain boundary conditions.
Therefore, it seems impractical to demand from these simula-
tions to provide quantity profiles right on top of experimental
ones. Nonetheless, in view of the above discrepancies, it appears
worthwhile to address: Would the predictions of the no-model
approach get
improved by using a turbulent-combustion
model?

PThe predictions from most of the no-model-approach simula-
tions discussed above cannot be deemed poor everywhere. Notably,
Genin et al. [99], Potturi & Edwards [96] and Fulton et al. [101] (all
LES) compare their predictions with experimental combustion met-
rics and consider practically-relevant geometries. Thus, assume only
for the remainder of Section 4.2 that these predictions are acceptable
for the design of actual propulsions systems. Hence, it is interesting
to address: Is the approach used by these no-model studies feasible
when applied to practical propulsion devices? This question is
addressed in the context of computational cost because it is a deter-
minant factor to accomplish this task. For this purpose, assume that
the smallest physical scales of the flows in the setups considered by
the above studies are within those of practical systems. Otherwise a
correction factor could be added to the following estimate. Note that
the simulations of practical devices being assumed here are not DNS
or high-resolution LES (as defined above) but simulations that
resolve enough of the physics as done in the above three studies.
Implied is the assumption that the model error would be similar in
Xthe above simulations of simple geometries and potential simula-
tions of actual geometries. Furthermore, assume that the smallest
geometrical features of actual and simplified geometries are the
same, and that the mesh is refined near walls but not excessively (e.
g. wall functions are used). With these assumptions, the number of
cells needed to simulate the flow in an actual geometry can be calcu-
lated from those used in simplified geometries, such as the ones con-
sidered by the above three studies. Roughly, the ratio of these cell
counts is proportional to the volumetric ratio. In this way, since
computational cost is proportional to the total number of cells, the

Pratio of the computational cost of simulations of simple and more
complex geometries is proportional to the ratio of the volumes of
these geometries. Unfortunately, the above studies do not document
the total cost of their simulations. (Potturi & Edwards [96] does pro-
vide cost comparisons between no-model and PaSR simulations,
though.) Thus, the cost is only roughly estimated.D
XThe volume of the
geometries considered by these studies, the DLR-wedge scramjet
and the UV-A scramjet, is O(100) cm3. That of larger but still simpli-
fied test geometries such as the AFRL-cell-18 scramjet [181] and the
SCHOLAR scramjet [104] is O(1000) cm3, while the volume of more
realistic scramjet geometries, such as the REST scramjet [91], is 0
(10,000) cm3. At the larger end, the volume of small augmentors is
about O(100,000) cm3 [182]. Thus, taking into account the present
considerations, the cost of no-model-approach simulations of small
scramjets would be an order of magnitude larger than those con-
ducted by Genin et al. [99], Potturi & Edwards [96] and Fulton et al.
[101], while those of larger scramjets and augmentors would be
orders of magnitude larger. Hence, if the above model errors are
acceptable, neglecting the interaction at the subgrid or fluctuating
level of turbulence, combustion and other physics, appears a feasible
approach for small scramjet engines, but not for other types of
engines. The caveat with these conclusions is that one cannot antici-
pate break-throughs in computer technology.

fraction and, say, a normalized enthalpy in nonpremixed flames
with nonnegligible radiation losses.

Pinclude an early study and, if applicable, applications to partially-
premixed systems or high-speed combustion): flamelet prolonga-
tion of intrinsic low dimensional manifolds [184,188], flamelet gen-
erated manifolds [183,185], flamelet-progress-variable method
[174,189], level set methods [190,191], the flame surface density
approach [192], or the thickened flame model [57,58,193,194]. Com-
mon forms of Eq. (5.3) include steady nonpremixed flamelets [37],
unsteady nonpremixed flamelets [195], steady unstrained premixed
flamelets, steady strained premixed flamelets (cf. Section 5.4), and
1D-autoignition flamelets [1,16,64]. These 1D solutions depend on
the averaged fields through the boundary conditions of Eq. (5.3).
Another way to see this dependence is to use the chain rule of differ-
(5.3) with
entiation to replace the spatial derivatives in Eq.
ca-derivatives and insert a parameter dependent on the averaged
fields. In the case of the classic steady flamelet formulation for non-
premixed flames, for example, this replacement leads to a 1D equa-
tion parameterized with a scalar dissipation rate, which is modeled
as a function of the averaged fields. Such a formulation takes Dca

fusion process or as a diffusivity in mixture fraction space [1].

5.2. Basic assumptions

P(cid:4) Thermochemical compositions are assumed to lie on manifolds,
i.e. cm
a in Eq. (5.2), that are low-dimensional. In other words, the
vast number of thermochemical quantities can be parameter-
ized by a small number of reduced parameters, simplifying con-
siderably the formulation. Usually 1D or 2D manifolds are used
but 3D manifolds have also been used [120].

P(cid:4) With these low-dimensional manifolds, flamelet simulations
map solutions of the flamelet equation given by Eq. (5.3) into
the 3D averaged fields with Eq. (5.2), and the assistance of Eq.
(5.5) as well.

P(cid:4) This mapping can be justified either on the grounds that the
model predictions agree well with experiments, or on the
grounds that it is consistent with the following physical picture:
(a) a flame surface surrounded by a nonreacting turbulent flow

Pcan be defined; (b) the thickness of this flame is less than the
Kolmogorov length; and, as a consequence of (b), (c) the struc-
ture of this flame is similar to that of a laminar flame. Assump-
tion (a) allows the definition of a flame tracking variable, such as
mixture fraction or progress variable, governed by Eq. (5.5).
Assumptions (b) and (c) are consistent with the use of Eq. (5.3).
P(cid:4) Flamelet formulations can be unsteady, as can be seen in

Eq. (5.3), but classic flamelet models are steady.

P(cid:4) The PDFs in the mappings represented by Eq. (5.2) need to be

presumed.

P(cid:4) The governing equations of the reduced parameters, Eq. (5.5),
and associated equations, such as Eq. (5.6), have a multitude of
problem-dependent unclosed terms that need modeling. This
has led to a large variety of approaches [1,64].

P(cid:4) Flamelet models rely on a spatial structure, represented by the
partial-differential equation (PDE) given by Eq. (5.3), to capture
the tight coupling between micromixing (molecular mixing)
and reaction characteristic of flamelet regimes, as well as scales
of relevance to these regimes (e.g., laminar-flame speeds and
laminar-flame lengths in premixed systems). By tight coupling
is implied here an effect of reaction on micromixing and vice
versa.

P(cid:4) Macromixing (subgrid-scale turbulent mixing in LES and turbu-
lent mixing in RANS) affects combustion through the presumed
PDFs and variables, other than the reduced parameters, used to
parameterized these PDFs. Examples of these variables include
mixture-fraction variance or progress-variable variance. There is
no direct effect of combustion on macromixing at the subgrid
level in LES or fluctuating level in RANS.

P(cid:4) Most flamelet formulations are designed for low-speed flows
and assume that pressure is everywhere constant when evaluat-
D 0 in Eq. (5.3). Nonethe-
ing the equation of state and take Shspd
less, flamelet models can be extended to high-speed flows as
discussed next.

5.3. Ways to model Shspd

e
Shspd

61⁄4 0; and Shspd

P1. Perhaps the simplest high-speed-flamelet formulation captures
flow compressions and expansions and viscous heating at the
LES or RANS level, but ignores them at the level of the flamelet
D 0 in the
model [106,196] ; in other words,
flamelet energy equation, Eq. (5.3). This model is indicated in
the third column in Table 4. Another simplification is to let the
pressure vary with position at the LES or RANS level, Eq. (3.5),
but evaluate Eq. (5.3) by taking the pressure everywhere con-
stant, say equal to a mean value of the device of interest. With
this approach, energy is being solved at the LES or RANS level
but not at the flamelet level. The advantage of this formulation
is that it does not add any new reduced parameters and, thus,
allows use of simple PDFs. However, although it may work in
some applications, using flamelet solutions for a mean device
pressure is unlikely to lead to a broadly applicable model. More
D 0 in the flamelet equations disregards
importantly, taking Shspd
the potential enhancement of combustion due to high-speed phe-
nomena. A last ingredient of this approach, and in fact of the four
approaches discussed here, is a set of models for the source/sink
terms due to the interaction of combustion with flow compres-
sions and expansions and viscous heating in the flame-surface-
density equation, Eq. (5.6), or equivalent equation.

P3. One way to relax the Shspd

D 0 assumption is to solve Eq. (5.3),
together with corresponding 1D equations for mass and
momentum, and add to the flamelet formulation a new reduced
parameter, such as a velocity-magnitude variable u [199]. This
approach is indicated in the fifth column of Table 4. In this way,
for instance, solutions can be obtained for counter-flow flame
simulations at high-speeds that have some of the physics of
high-speed combustion. This approach takes advantage of the
spatial structure inherent in flamelet modeling. In comparison,
TPDF methods do not have an equivalent structure to take
advantage for this purpose. However, the challenge is that a
new reduced parameter is introduced. Say that the reduced
parameters are mixture fraction, z, scalar dissipation, x, and u.
Since z and u are related to the large scales, and x to the small
scales, one could use the approximation f ðz; x; uÞ Dm f1ðz; uÞf2ðxÞ;
where f1 and f2 are PDFs. Even with this simplification, obtain-
ing f1(z, u) is not trivial. For example, an attempt to do so for
nonpremixed combustion resorted to various problem-depen-
dent simplifications, valid only for supersonic jets with spa-
the
tially uniform pressure, and needed to complement
flamelet model with conditional moment closure [199]. (This
attempt is not coupled to a CFD simulation, though.) A less
troublesome difficulty arising from this formulation is that
two energy variables arise: one a solution of the LES or RANS
energy equation, and another one obtained via Eq. (5.2) from
the flamelet solutions. This difficulty also occurs in other tur-
bulent-combustion models.

two reduced parameters, say, pressure and a velocity variable. Fol-

5.4. Discussion

PSeveral early studies of scramjet-like geometries with flamelets
consider the DLR-wedge scramjet, cf. Fig. 10. Oevermann [105] uses
2D RANS with steady nonpremixed flamelets, parameterized with
mixture fraction and a mean strain rate, and a nine-species chemi-
cal-kinetics model for hydrogen(cid:1)air combustion. He also uses slip
and adiabatic boundary conditions for the channel walls. Fig. 11
shows that his predictions for mean temperature agree fairly well
with the experiments but produce a broader wake. Note, however,
that Oevermann uses 2D simulations in a problem for which this
assumption is difficult to justify since the fuel is injected through cir-
cular holes at the base of the wedge. Berglund et al. [106] uses 3D
LES with two different flamelet models and a two-step chemical
mechanism. One model uses mixture fraction and scalar dissipation
rate as the reduced parameters (dashed lines in Fig. 11), and another
one uses mixture fraction and a reactive scalar (solid lines in Fig. 11),
the latter of which is governed by an equation similar to Eq. (5.5).
They use wall functions to model the flow near the channel walls.
Berglund et al. obtains better temperature predictions than Oever-
mann at the xD58 and xD156 mm planes, but not at the xD11 mm
plane where they overpredict the temperature by about 1000 K. In
other words, combustion is predicted where it is not seen in the
experiments. This overprediction contrasts with the underprediction
of temperature seen at the same plane in the no-model studies of
Genin et al. [99] and Potturi & Edwards [96] discussed in Section 4.2.
Note that these observations by Berglund et al. apply to the two
flamelet models they use. Thus, it can be conjectured that the region
right downstream of the wedge is not well predicted by the mix-
ture-fraction-dissipation-rate model because this model does not
take into account the partial premixing there, cf. Section 4.2 and
Ref. [174], but it is not clear why the mixture-fraction-reactive-sca-
lar model fails. A more recent flamelet study, however, does provide
a good prediction in this difficult induction zone right downstream
of the wedge. Zhouqin et al. [107] uses 2D RANS with the mixture-
fraction-dissipation-rate model and the flamelet-progress-variable
model (FPV) [174], the latter of which is similar (but not the same)
to the mixture-fraction-reactive-scalar model of Berglund et al.
[106] in the sense that the reduced parameters are selected in order
to try to better capture partial premixing. Zhouqin et al. uses a nine-
species chemical mechanism and slip channel walls. They observe
that with the mixture-fraction-dissipation-rate model the flame is
attached to the wedge, while FPV produces a flame that attaches and

Pdetaches unsteadily. This unsteadiness is also documented in the
LES-no-model study of Potturi & Edwards [96], as well as in the LES-
PaSR simulations of Fureby et al. [100], the latter of which currently
provide the most accurate predictions for the DLR-scramjet at all
three stations. The fact that this liftoff is captured by FPV and not
with the mixture-fraction-dissipation-rate model is consistent with
the motivation for the development of FPV in the first place [174].
All these observations are further consistent with the (slightly)
enhanced prediction of mean temperature at the xD11 mm plane of
FPV in comparison with the mixture-fraction-dissipation-rate
model, as can be seen in Fig. 11. In spite of this favorable outcome,
further downstream (xD156 mm station) Zhouqin et al. documents
large disagreements between their predictions and measurements.
Moreover, the above warning about the 2D simulations of Oever-
mann apply to those of Zhouqin et al. as well. Furthermore, it is
unlikely that the wall boundary conditions used by Zhouqin et al.
(slip walls) are an accurate representation of the actual flow. To close
this discussion about simulations of the DLR-wedge scramjet, it is
not clear that including more physics into the flamelet-model for-
mulation makes the predictions more accurate since they do in one
study but not in another one. In addition, neither of these flamelet
studies model the subgrid (LES) or fluctuating (RANS) level interac-
tion of flow compressions and expansions with combustion, i.e.,
they use the first approach in Section 5.3, so that the effect of model-
ing or not such interactions cannot be assessed. Moreover, it is also
not clear that flamelet models provide better predictions than those
from the no-model approach discussed in Section 4.2. However,
such a comparison is flawed because many factors, other than the
turbulent-combustion model, are different between two sets of sim-
ulations. For instance, the wall boundary conditions could have a
major effect on the temperature profiles at the two downstream sta-
tions, as discussed in Section 4.2. In contrast, the following study
allows for a more fair comparison between the no-model approach
and flamelet models.

PChan et al. [108] considers the UV-A scramjet [102] and uses LES
with an FPV model using the second approach in Section 5.3 [198]
and a nineteen-step mechanism for hydrogen-air combustion.
Fig. 14 shows more accurate predictions of temperature maps by the
flamelet model (FPV in Fig. 14) in comparison with the no-model
approach (FR). Furthermore, a comparison of Figs. 14 and 13 appears
to reveal more sensitivity to the choice of the turbulent-combustion
model than to that of the chemical-kinetics model. (A color scale in
Fig. 13 would have helped in drawing a firmer conclusion.) Thus, it is
difficult to argue against the case that the flamelet model enhances
the accuracy of the predictions over the no-model approach. Such an

Penhancement is more pronounced in the xD7.5 cm plane closer to
the ramp and the injector, denoted in Fig. 12. This is consistent with
the observation by Fulton et al. [101] on that, since the turbulence is
more intense in the xD7.5 cm plane than in the 11.3 cm plane, the
interaction between turbulence and chemistry is more important in
the former plane, which would make a turbulent-combustion model
prediction more accurate than that of the no-model approach. In
spite of these enhanced predictions, the flamelet model of Chan
et al. [108] does underpredict considerably the temperature close to
the wall at the xD7.5 cm plane, and near the intersection of the
yD0.015 m plane and the z symmetry plane at the xD11.3 cm sta-
tion. Furthermore, Chan et al. underpredicts the wall pressure (Fig. 5
of their paper) and the pressure increase in the combustion region.
In contrast, and despite overpredicting the mean temperature at the
xD7.5 cm plane as shown in Fig. 14, the no-model approach appears
to give a more accurate prediction of wall pressure than the flamelet
model. Chan et al. attributes this confusing result to cancellation of
errors in the modeling. To explain this issue, it must be kept in mind
that faster reaction rates imply a more rapid pressure increase in the
streamwise direction. (This can be seen using an inviscid 1D energy
equation.) The various physical models used by Chan et al. tend to
give lower reaction rates near the wall and, since the no-model
approach overpredicts such rates (reflected in higher temperatures
in Fig. 14 at the xD7.5 cm plane), it compensates for the former and
produces a more accurate wall pressure variation in the streamwise
direction than the flamelet model. This is also an example of why
conclusions from studies focusing only on wall pressure, such as
those discussed in Section 2, should be interpreted with care. None-
theless, the fact that it appears that some physics are being improp-
erly modeled remains.

PIt is not clear from the above what is the role of modeling or not
the interaction between combustion and flow compressions and
expansions. Saghafian [109] clarifies this issue. He considers the
HiFIRE cavity-stabilized scramjet [110] and uses LES with the FPV
model and the second approach of Section 5.3 to model Shspd. More-
over, he documents the sensitivity of the streamwise variation of
wall pressure to the use or not of the scaling given by Eq. (5.8) which
physically represents the effect of flow compressions and expan-
sions on combustion. This sensitivity can be seen in Fig. 15 which
shows that the prediction of wall pressure is significantly enhanced
by using such a scaling. Recalling that an increase of wall pressure is
correlated to increasing heat release, Fig. 15 demonstrates an

Penhancement of the combustion process due to the effect of flow
compressions and expansions on the combustion process, an effect
supported by an analysis of the maps of progress variable in Sagha-
fian [109] (not shown), and seen in a different problem in the discus-
sion of Fig. 6. Therefore, the fact that flamelet models allow the
inclusion of the physics of the interaction between combustion and
flow compressions and expansions as discussed in Section 5.3 can
help to improve the accuracy of the model. Nonetheless, Saghafian
also reports a strong sensitivity of his results to the way the near-
wall physics are handled. This issue is discussed next, but in the con-
text of the observations of various flamelet studies.

PTwo flamelet simulations notably underpredict (by up to about
30%) the wall pressure in scramjet-like geometries [108,196]. This
underprediction is seen in simulations using either the first or sec-
ond approaches in Section 5.3 to model the subgrid (LES) or fluctuat-
ing (RANS) interaction between combustion and flow compressions
and expansions. Chan et al. [108] attributes this inaccuracy to lower
reaction rates near the wall, which can be seen in the top frames of
Fig. 14. (Note that experimental values right at the wall are not
shown.) These low near-wall reaction rates are also observed in the
form of low amount of OH when comparing the top (LES) and bot-
tom (experiments) frames of Fig. 16 from the simulations of

Fig. 16. Time-averaged OH (YOH D 0 blue and 0.024 white) in the symmetry plane in
the LES-flamelet (top) and RANS-flamelet (middle) of Saghafian et al. [111] and corre-
sponding experiments (bottom). This is Fig. 14 in Ref. [111]. It is reprinted with per-
mission from Elsevier. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure
legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

PSaghafian et al. [111,197] of the JICF of Gamba et al. [112,143], cf.
Fig. 1. Saghafian et al. uses the FPV model with the second approach
of Section 5.3 to model Shspd. Thus, it is likely that these flamelet sim-
ulations are underpredicting the combustion intensity near the wall.
Such an underprediction has been mentioned to be due to the clo-
sure of the mixture-fraction variance equation; the choice of the pre-
sumed PDFs; the inability of the model to capture autoignition; the
inability of the model to capture flame quenching; and, the use of
steady assumptions for an unsteady problem [108,111,197]. In other
words, the problem is with the turbulent-combustion modeling.
Although such a possibility is not ruled out here, it is interesting to
consider another one. Notice in Fig. 16 that near the wall RANS pro-
vides a more accurate prediction of OH than LES. In addition, con-
sider that in high-Reynolds-number flows near walls, such as the
present ones, it has been found useful to combine LES with RANS so
that RANS is used near the walls [33]. Furthermore, note that the
above underprediction of wall pressure is not seen by Larsson et al.
[113] (their Fig. 3) who used a novel wall model for LES. Larsson
et al. uses FPV with the second approach of Section 5.3 to model Shspd
and simulates the HyShot II combustor [114,115]. In addition, Sagha-
fian [109] (his Fig. 7.15) documents that simulations of the HiFIRE
combustor with the wall model used by Larson et al. produce com-
bustion right downstream the injector, while those not using it give
no combustion at this location. These observations point to the
hypothesis that the observed underprediction of near-wall reaction
rates is due to the disregard of a near-wall viscous heating that is of
the order of the heat of combustion. Viscous heating of such inten-
sity is not surprising in scramjets since the bulk flow is supersonic.
Such an explanation would also clarify why the LES-no-model simu-
lations of Chan et al. [108], discussed above, which overpredict such
rates near the injector, give a better prediction of wall pressures
than their FPV model. Therefore, although this hypothesis pends
testing by carefully studying the effect of using wall models, it is
important to keep in mind that high-speed combustion problems
involve many physics, and mispredictions are difficult to attribute
solely to the turbulent-combustion model.

PFor the JICF of Gamba et al. [112,143], Fig. 1 shows that the OH
appears as diffuse and broad regions near the wall, and as fine
regions between the wake and ambient flow. Gamba et al. interprets
the former to be distributed-reaction-like regions, and the latter
flamelet-like regions. (Gamba et al. [112] also rules out that potential
three-body recombination reactions near the wall are producing
such OH broad regions.) Therefore, in view of the above discrepancy
between flamelet predictions and experiments near the wall, where
such distributed-reaction-like regions are seen, it is worthwhile to
address how well flamelet models perform in predicting the features
of these regions. Nonetheless, before doing so, consider a premixed-
flame problem that is close to this regime but still flamelet-like.

PKnudsen et al. [116] uses LES and considers the premixed San-
dia-slot-burner DNS of Sankaran et al. [117] whose conditions are
denoted in Fig. 4 with an open triangle. They argue that at these
conditions the strain is high enough to invalidate the use of the
unstrained premixed flamelet formulation and, motivated by this
inconsistency of a classic model, they develop a new strained pre-
mixed flamelet formulation. Knudsen et al. maps solutions of the
unstrained-flamelet version of Eq. (5.3) into the LES fields with
Eq. (5.2) using two reduced parameters. One is the progress vari-
able, a linear combination of various species mass fractions. The
selection of the second one, however, is not trivial. One straightfor-
ward choice would be the scalar dissipation rate. Nonetheless,
using this variable is undesirable because for a given point in the
progress-variable-scalar-dissipation plane there would be more
than one flamelet solution. The same applies when using the mass
fraction of CO, although not for H. However, a challenge of using
the mass fraction of H as the other reduced parameter is that it is
dependent on the progress variable, which would make more

Pcan provide good predictions of the challenging problem of mildly-
strained premixed flames. In other words, by making the model
more consistent with the physics of the problem at hand, Knudsen
et al. and Langella et al. improve the accuracy of their flamelet
models.

PChen et al. [120] considers the piloted premixed flames of Dunn
et al. [11,24], explained in the discussion of Fig. 3. For this purpose,
Chen et al. uses LES and develops a new three-stream-flamelet-prog-
ress-variable model based on a process similar to that discussed

Pdifficult the definition of presumed PDFs. Knudsen et al. solves this
problem by selecting the maximum value of the mass fraction of H
as their second reduced parameter, since this parameter is indepen-
dent from the progress variable. The formulation of their model is
completed by selecting a beta PDF for progress variable, and a delta
PDF for the maximum mass fraction of H. With this formulation, as
Fig. 17 shows, Knudsen et al. obtains predictions of mean tempera-
ture profiles for the premixed Sandia-slot-burner DNS more accu-
rate than those from the classic unstrained flamelet formulation.
Langella et al. [118] also observes such an enhanced prediction
over the classic unstrained flamelet model with LES. They do so,
however, for simulations of the Bunsen-burner premixed flames of
Cheng et al. [119] and by using a flamelet model parameterized
with progress variable and its dissipation rate. These flames have
conditions denoted in Fig. 4 and are discussed in Section 6.4.
Therefore, by selecting carefully the reduced parameters and their
common in flamelet modeling
presumed PDFs, a process

Pabove. Their reduced parameters include two mixture fractions and
a reaction-progress parameter. Fig. 18 shows the profiles of fuel
mass fraction predicted by Chen et al. and those from the experi-
ments. Such a quantity is shown because the rate of consumption of
fuel is a good indicator to expose problems when modeling these
flames [131], cf. Section 6.4. Fig. 18 shows a good agreement
between simulations and experiments near the jet exit, but some
noticeable disagreements further downstream. Moreover, these dis-
agreements are small for the flamelet-like flame PM1-50, but they
get more pronounced when going from the PM1-100, to the PM1-
150, and finally to the PM1-200 flame. In other words, the modeling
errors increase as one moves from the thickened-reaction-zone
regime to the distributed-reaction-zone regime, cf. the symbols cor-
responding to the flames of Dunn et al. in Fig. 4. Chen et al. acknowl-
edges such discrepancies and mentions that they could be reduced
by adding a fourth reduced parameter to their formulation in order
to take into account unsteadiness. However, such an approach
appears inconsistent with observations from TPDF simulations of
these flames, discussed in Section 6.4, which do take into account
unsteadiness and also observe the trend of progressively larger
modeling errors when going from the thickened-reaction-zone
regime towards the distributed-reaction-zone regime. Moreover,
Chen et al. does not address the fact that the structure of the flames
where their disagreement is larger is different from that of laminar
flames, as the discussion of the experimental results in Figs. 3 and 5
demonstrate. In fact, Zhou et al. [25] mentions that these set of
experimental results “calls for a revision of the current flamelet com-
bustion models”. Nonetheless, this unsatisfactory performance of
flamelets occurs in one of the most challenging combustion prob-
lems at the time of this writing, it is unclear if TPDF does better, and
LEM and ODT has not even been applied to this problem.

PThe following conclusions can be drawn from the studies

reviewed in this section and their corresponding discussion:

P1. Incorporating more physics into the formulation of flamelet
models has improved their accuracy in simulations of high-
speed combustion problems [107,109,113,116,118], with one
exception [106]. Furthermore, in one study the flamelet model
predicts more accurately the combustion process than the no-
model approach [108], in particular where the turbulence is
intense.

P2. The predictions from the flamelet simulations considered here,
although not poor in overall (except for two cases in Ref. [120]),
cannot be deemed satisfactory because they include, for exam-
ple, local O(100) K deviations in simulations of the DLR combus-
tor, O(10) % errors in wall pressure in scramjet-like problems,
and underprediction of reaction rates near walls. Thus, since
including more physics in flamelet models appears to improve
their accuracy, it makes sense to continue this process for high-
speed combustion problems.

P3. Nonetheless, because of the many physics involved, and the
complexity of the experiments (particularly in scramjet-like
ones), it is important to keep in mind that factors other than the
turbulent combustion model can lead to significant discrepan-
cies between predictions and experimental measurements.
Thus, care must be taken in not attributing the overall modeling
error to the turbulent-combustion model only.

P4. Several studies considered here show that the more physics one
adds to flamelet formulations, the more difficult it becomes to
address (cf. discussions of Refs. [109,116,120,199] above and
Ref. [121] below): Which reduced parameters should be used
for a particular combustion problem? Which 1D equations
should be used? How are these 1D solutions affected by the
averaged fields? Which PDF forms should be assumed? D
XThis is a
first challenge to use flamelets in high-speed-combustion prob-
lems.

P5. Even though assuming a turbulent flame as “an ensemble of 1D
flamelets” [186] is consistent with many combustion problems
of interest, it is not clear how to reconcile this flame structure
with that observed in experiments and DNS of high-speed com-
bustion, such as those discussed in Section 2. This is a second
challenge to use flamelets in high-speed combustion problems.

POne workaround to the second challenge would be to forgo the
physical interpretation of flamelet modeling in favor of an abstract
one in which flamelet modeling is seen as a framework to use low-
dimensional manifolds. D
XIn such case, anything can be use to create
the flame structure, flamelet equations, DNS, highly-resolved no-
model LES, or other turbulent-combustion models, as discussed
shortly. Nonetheless, even with this workD
Xaround the first challenge
remains.

PTo explain one way to address the above challenges, consider for
explanation purposes the reacting JICF of Micka et al. [147].
(Although subsonic this JICF shares many features with supersonic
ones because the temperature rise near the fuel injection region due
to the deceleration of the cross-flow in supersonic JICFs is “replaced”
in this subsonic JICF by that from having a high-temperature vitiated
ambient air.) The experiments by Micka et al. show that autoignition
happens immediately downstream of the fuel jet injection point,
and is followed downstream by a premixed flame, which in turn is
followed by non-premixed burning. Furthermore, although not
documented by Micka et al., and again only for explanation pur-
poses, say that the combustion near the wall occurs in the distrib-
uted-reaction-like mode. This is not an unlikely scenario since such
burning is seen, for example, in the JICF of Gamba et al. [112] dis-
cussed in Section 2. Thus, the computational domain could be
divided into four regions and a different turbulent-combustion
model could be used in each of them as follows: one region where
an auto-ignition flamelet formulation is used, another one where
premixed flamelets are used, another one where nonpremixed
flamelets are used, and a last region where a modeling approach
consistent with the distributed-reaction-like regime is used. Implied
here is the assumption of regions in (physical) space, but they may
well be in space-time. In this way, this proposed hybrid-modeling
approach would meet the above two challenges of flamelet model-
ing. (Hybrid physical models are not new [202]: Consider boundary-
layer theory and LES-RANS hybrid models.) However, the following
two questions arise: Where in space-time should one model be used
over another? D
XWhich type of boundary conditions should be applied
in each of the above regions? Both of these questions have been

brevity, the following considers only the former question.

PWu et al. [121] follows the above hybrid-modeling idea and pro-
poses to select a model for a particular region based on a cost func-
tion (a Pareto front) that depends on a model error and the

from a “true” solution, such as that given by a DNS. However, doing
so is impractical since conducting a DNS everywhere is. Therefore,
Wu et al. uses instead an approximate error and defines it as a func-
tion depending on the initial rate of deviation of the simulation solu-
tion from the “true” solution. This approximate error can be
computed in a computationally affordable way. In order to test their
approach, Wu et al. considers a laminar triplet flame, a simple but
nontrivial problem since it involves partial premixing. Furthermore,
for this purpose, they use three approaches: DNS, a flamelet-prog-
ress-variable (FPV) formulation, or a flamelet-prolongation of intrin-
sic-low-dimensional-manifold (FPI) model.

simulations of Wu et al.
[121] decide which of these three
approaches to apply in a spatial region depending on the approxi-
mate error. Fig. 19 shows that their proposed approach (denoted
PEC in Fig. 19) agrees better with (pure) DNS results (DC in Fig. 19)

Psolved for, among others. An attempt in doing so is available [142]
but it is unfair in the sense that it compares the cost of flamelet mod-
els with other models by assuming that the latter do not use any of
the available chemistry acceleration algorithms, such as in situ adap-
tive tabulation [207] and artificial neural networks [208,209]. How-
ever, this points to what is perhaps the undeniable advantage of
flamelet models over other models: Whereas models such as TPDF,
LEM and ODT provide a closure for the average chemical source
term and need to rely on other methods to compute the instanta-
neous chemical source term in an affordable way, flamelets solveD
both of these problems at once.

Pthan those obtained solely with FPV or FPI. However, it is important
to note that such a good prediction is attained by switching to DNS
wherever the error of FPV or FPI is deemed too large. This is accept-
able for the laminar problem considered by Wu et al., but perhaps
impractical for high-speed-combustion problems. Nonetheless, the
idea behind their approach is not necessarily limited to flamelet
models, any model could be used. Thus, if there is a particular region
where no flamelet model performs accurately, the approach could
rely on, say, adaptive-mesh refinement [203] to switch to a DNS or a
highly-resolved no-model LES, and perhaps do so in a computation-
ally-affordable way if the region is small enough. Therefore, Wu
et al. offers a promising approach to address the above two flamelet
challenges.

(5.3)

PThe hybrid model idea also applies to models other than flame-
lets. For instance, several methods have been proposed in which the
flamelet equation given by Eq.
is replaced with LEM
equations (Eqs. (7.1)(cid:1)(7.12) below) [204(cid:1)206]. The end result is a
flamelet-like model in the sense that the low-dimensional-manifold
assumption is central to them, and thus require the definition of
problem-dependent reduced parameters. Examples of the reduced
parameters used include mixture fraction, scalar dissipation, strain
rate, and a Reynolds number. However, these flamelet-like models
do not need to assume the form of a PDF. They compute it. Further-
more, they are more flexible in the type of subgrid flow assumed,
since this flow is not restricted to 1D counterflow flames or 1D freely
propagating flames. For this purpose, LEM simulations that are
uncoupled to a LES or RANS are conducted (i.e., Eqs. (7.1)(cid:1)(7.12) are
solved in a 1D domain) by assuming the type of flow, which could be
a laminar or turbulent counterflow flame or a reacting mixing layer,
among others. ODT could also be used for this purpose. In this way,
in principle, this flamelet-like model could allow the approximation
of the structure of distributed-reaction-like zones, although this has
not been demonstrated to the authors’ knowledge. Therefore, other
models can be brought into a flamelet formulation to address the
above two challenges.

combustion models to be conclusive, it should consider the cost of

weight the cost to take into account the accuracy of the model, and
it should include various significant and practical combustion prob-
lems. Unfortunately, to the authors’ knowledge, there is not such a
study. A workaround to this dilemma is to consider, rather than the
absolute cost, the scaling of the cost with quantities such as the
number of cells in the mesh and the number of variables being

tions and the conditionally-averaged LES equations [210], not to the
more common LES equations, in which case the concept of a filtered
density function, FDF, or filtered mass density function applies [74].
However, because the present goal is to use the governing equations
of TPDF to outline and discuss its basic assumptions, and the govern-
ing equations for PDFs and FDFs have the same form [47], it is suffi-
cient to use the concept of PDF.) Implied in the above discussions of
flamelets and of Eq. (6.1) is a PDF defined using the thermochemical
variables. However, to guide the next discussions, consider instead
the more general velocity-energy-composition PDF, fuc and its gov-
erning equation (adapted from Appendix A in Haworth [47]):

PThe terms in the left-hand side of Eq. (6.2) are given by local values
and, hence, they are closed. It is noteworthy that among these closed
terms is the chemical source term. On the other hand, the terms in
the right-hand side of Eq. (6.2), being conditioned gradients, need clo-
sure. Note that these closure problems can be circumvented by defin-
ing the PDF with gradients of relevant quantities [1]. However, this is
rarely done, other than when a turbulent frequency is used. The first
term in the right-hand side of Eq. (6.2) represents macromixing, the
second one micromixing, and the third represents the effect of fluid-
induced flow compressions and expansions and viscous heating.

(SEF) methods [213(cid:1)215], and moment methods [63], the last of
which are also called multi-environment PDF methods. The discus-
sion of all these methods is considered outside the present scope.
Nonetheless, with the sole purpose of guiding next discussions, con-
sider the Lagrangian-particle method since it is the most developed
and has the largest amount of submodels available. With this
method, closure problems are dealt with by designing a system of
many notional fluid particles whose evolution gives an approxima-
tion to fuc as given by Eq. (6.2). These particles are not fluid particles
per se but (mathematical) constructs to produce a histogram of the
PDF. With this approach, the following notional-particle equations
are time-advanced:

where Geff is an effective diffusivity, equal to an eddy diffusivity
in RANS, and the sum of subgrid diffusivity and molecular diffu-
sivity in LES.

PMicromixing closures

PThere are many available micromixing models for TPDF [47,63].
Some examples include the interaction-by-exchange-with-the-
mean (IEM) model, Euclidean minimization spanning tree [218],
multiple mapping conditioning (MMC) [219], shadow positioning
mixing model [220], hierarchical parcel swapping [221,222], among
others [47,63]. For the present purposes, it is useful to consider the
following three models.

where C0 is a model constant, Gij a tensor which is a function of
local one-point velocity statistics, and dWi is an isotropic vector
Wiener process. Many forms for Gij can be assumed, as long they
are within certain mathematical (e.g., tensor properties) and
physical constraints.

P(cid:4) Usually Gij is simplified with the so-called simplified Langevin

model [216]:

with tT being a representative turbulent time-scale. The isotropic
assumption is evident in Eq. (6.8) because the tensor Gij has zero
nondiagonal terms.

P(cid:4) This simplified Langevin model can be modified to include the
effects of from the interaction between turbulence and strong
flow compressions and expansions with [217]:

Here c(cid:3)
a is the value of a thermophysical quantity evaluated at a
notional fluid particle, and Ciem is a model constant. IEM lets
notional particles exchange their information through the aver-
aged (mean) fields only, in a way that the micromixing does not
affect these averaged fields. However, IEM lacks several proper-
ties of actual micromixing, such as dependency on scalar length-
scales, which is evident by noting that there are no length-scales
in Eq. (6.11). Moreover, IEM violates the locality in composition
space, which means that it allows the mixing of two fluid par-
ticles that are “far-away” in composition space.

P(cid:4) The multiple-mapping-conditioning (MMC) micromixing model
improves the physics of micromixing by combining TPDF with
concepts of low-dimensional manifolds [219,223,224]. In MMC,
one or more reduced parameters, cr
; are defined, and averaged
b
equations, e.g. Eq. (5.5), are solved for them. Examples of these
reduced parameters include mixture fraction, scalar dissipation,
and enthalpy. At every time step of the simulation, notional-
fluid particles are grouped in pairs in a way that the following
distance,
lp,q, between, say, a particle p and a particle q, is
approximately minimized (In practice this minimization is done
with a k-dimensional tree method [224].):

reduced parameter, but more could be used. The model constant
Cmmc can be varied between 0, in which locality is enforced only
in physical space, or large values, in which locality is enforced in
the reduced-parameter space. In the latter case, the MMC micro-
mixing model attains flamelet-like features. The distinguishing
feature of MMC is that, with the aid of a reduced parameter, Eq.
(6.12) allows to enforce locality in physical and compositional
space. Once the particles p and q have been selected, they are
mixed according to:

PIEM, the MMC micromixing model permits the use of a signifi-
cantly reduced number of notional-fluid particles in the compu-
tational domain. Such is the case because, while models such as
IEM require a large number of particles per LES or RANS compu-
tational cell to not significantly violate locality, MMC is built to
achieve locality, through the minimization of l2

p;q.

P(cid:4) In the TPDF framework, the tight coupling between micromixing
and reaction of flamelet regimes implies that the combination of
the reaction and micromixing terms in Eq. (6.2), represented
here as

with ha being a function defined by Eq. (6.14), is closed [45]. This
is the case because ha depends only on local information. The
function ha can be computed from solutions to the flamelet
equations, such as Eq. (5.3). However, since Eq. (6.14) is only
applicable right near the flame, other micromixing models are
needed away from this region. As a result, a means to identify
where to apply Eq. (6.14) is necessary. This identification can be
done with flame-tracking variables such as the averaged prog-
ress variable in premixed combustion, and averaged mixture
fraction in nonpremixed flames, both governed by equations
such as Eq. (5.5). Further details of this [225] and other
approaches [47,226] for flamelet modeling in TPDF are discussed
elsewhere.

6.2. Basic assumptions

P(cid:4) TPDF methods do not need to invoke low-dimensional-manifold
assumptions. This is evident by noticing that Eq. (6.1), in con-
trast with itsD
X in flamelets, does not involve
low-dimensional manifolds.

X corresponding oneD

P(cid:4) TPDF methods do not assume PDF shapes but solve transport

equations for them, such as Eq. (6.2).

P(cid:4) The most basic equation of TPDF, Eq. (6.2), is unsteady.
P(cid:4) The chemical source term, i.e. the third term in the left-hand
side of Eq. (6.2), appears in closed form because it depends only
on local information.

P(cid:4) TPDF has no spatial structure (e.g. no spatial representation of
the subgrid flow in LES or the fluctuating flow in RANS), a conse-
quence of TPDF methods being based on one-point PDFs. As a
result, all terms in Eq. (6.2) containing conditioned gradients
need closure. Therefore, even though the chemical source term
is closed, other closure problems arise.

P(cid:4) If velocity is used to define the PDF, macromixing (subgrid-scale
turbulent mixing in LES and turbulent mixing in RANS) can be
represented with Langevin models such as Eq. (6.7) or (6.8).

P(cid:4) If velocity is not used to define the PDF, macromixing is usually
represented with a gradient-transport model and a turbulent
diffusivity, such as Eq. (6.10).

P(cid:4) Macromixing affects combustion through Eqs. (6.7)(cid:1)(6.10). As a
result, since typically none of these equations depend on com-
bustion, there is no direct effect of combustion on macromixing
at the subgrid level in LES or fluctuating level in RANS. However,
submodels to account for this effect could be developed if
needed.

P(cid:4) The effect of fluid-induced compressions and expansions and
viscous heating on macromixing could be included with simple
(isotropic) models such as Eq. (6.9), or by matching a form for Gij
in Eq. (6.7) to compressible-turbulence data.

P(cid:4) Micromixing can be modeled in many different ways. Typically,
it is represented with algorithms that mimic actual micromixing
by partially or fully intermixing pairs or groups of notional fluid
particles. To accomplish this goal, micromixing models are
designed to satisfy certain physical and mathematical proper-
ties.

P(cid:4) With adequate micromixing models, TPDF can capture flamelet
regimes. One approach is given by Eq. (6.14) and flamelet solu-
tions for ha, but many others have been proposed.

P(cid:4) In low-speed flows, typically pressure is taken everywhere con-
D 0 in Eqs. (6.2)

stant to evaluate the equation of state, and Shspd
or (6.5). For high-speed flows, TPDF needs submodels for Shspd.

6.3. Ways to model Shspd

P1. In TPDF, the interaction between combustion and strong flow
compressions and expansions and viscous heating enter the for-
mulation through S(cid:3)
hspd in Eq. (6.5). The simplest approach is to use
(cid:3)

lowing the second method in Table 3, in which Psgs D (cid:2)sgs D 0 in
e
Eq. (3.6). Here
Shspd evaluated at the particle position. Con-
sider that the PDF is defined with energy and species mass frac-
tions, which is a common approach. Moreover, consider the
Lagrangian-particle-Eulerian-mesh framework in which the aver-
aged velocity, pressure, and energy variable are being solved in an
Eulerian grid, and the particle equations given by Eqs. (6.3)(cid:1)(6.5)
are being solved in a Lagrangian way, with energy and species
mass fractions as the thermochemical quantities. Thus, there are
two energies, one at the LES or RANS level, and another one at the
particle level. Their consistency is enforced by using the same
high-speed source term at the LES or RANS level and particle level.
Nonetheless, potential inconsistencies should be monitored in
practice. One desirable feature of using an energy variable in the
LES or RANS level is that phenomena such as shocks are handled
at this level (not at the particle level), making the overall method
numerically robust. (Further details include care in the computa-
tion of gradients in Eqs. (6.3)(cid:1)(6.5). For example, one formulation
uses a modified minmod limiter to compute the pressure gradients
in Eq. (3.6) [227].) As a result of this design, for consistency it is
assumed that all the notional-fluid particles in a given LES or RANS
cell have the same pressure.

P2. TPDF offers at least two options to model S(cid:3)

hspd when using infor-
mation from both the LES or RANS and models for the subgrid
(in LES) or fluctuating (in RANS) pressure(cid:1)dilatation, pressure
variation, and viscous heating. Note that these options belong to
(cid:3)
Dm e
the third method in Table 3. In the first option, S(cid:3)
hspd with
S
e
Shspd given by Eq. (3.6) and adequate submodels for Psgs
and (cid:2)sgs. In practice, however, only submodels for nonreacting
flows are available [168,171].

hspd

P3. Another option in TPDF to use the third method in Table 3 is to
define a PDF with turbulent frequency, velocity, pressure,
energy, and species mass fractions, and to use a (fully) Lagrang-
ian-particle framework, rather than the Lagrangian/Eulerian one
above. Thus, since velocity and pressure are used to define the
PDF, there is no need for Eulerian solutions for these variables.
In this way, a model for Shspd could be [217]:
hspd dt Dm A dt¡p(cid:3)d ð1=rÞ(cid:3);
S(cid:3)

dp(cid:3) Dm p(cid:3)ðB dt C C dWÞ;
ð6:15Þ
where A, B, and C are functions representing the interaction
between combustion and flow compressions and expansions
and viscous heating. With some algebraic manipulation, Delarue
& Pope [217] uses the models of Zeman [168], discussed above,
and Sarkar et al. [171] to obtain these functions. It is not clear,
however, how to use this approach to handle shocks in a robust
way [217].

P4. Finally, because TPDF lacks a spatial structure, it does not pro-
vide any means to approximate the subgrid (LES) or fluctuating
(RANS) viscous-heating and pressure(cid:1)dilatation terms. In other
words, while the chemical source term in Eq. (6.2) can be exactly

Pclosed, the high-speed-source term requires submodels for its
closure, in the same way that the micromixing term does.

6.4. Discussion

PEarly TPDF simulations of supersonic jet flames include those by
Delarue & Pope [217] and Hsu et al. [122]. Since the former does not
make comparisons with experiments, only the latter is considered
here. Hsu et al. simulates the jet of Evans et al. [123] in which a
supersonic jet of hydrogen is surrounded by an also supersonic
coflow of vitiated air. Hsu et al. uses 2D RANS with a scalar TPDF
approach and the Eulerian-mesh-Lagrangian-particle method and a
two-step chemical mechanism for hydrogen combustion. They use
the second approach in Section 6.3 to model the interaction between
combustion and flow compressions and expansions. For this purpose
they use the model of Sarkar et al. [170] for pressure(cid:1)dilatation at
low turbulent Mach number, and the model of Shi et al. [228] for the
convection of pressure, both of which assume a nonreacting flow. In
this way, Hsu et al. obtains accurate predictions for the species mass
fractions, but with some discrepancies at the outer part of the reac-
tion layer (edge of the jet). These discrepancies are also seen by
Mobus et al. [124], as discusses shortly. Hsu et al. also shows accu-
rate predictions for the wall jet of Burrows et al. [88]. However, this
problem is well predicted by the RANS-no-model of Engblom et al.
[87], cf. Section 4.2, suggesting that using the more complex TPDF
for this problem may be unnecessary. Furthermore, Engblom et al.
obtains better predictions for mean temperature than Hsu et al.
Nonetheless, it is difficult to draw conclusions by comparing the
studies of Hsu et al. and Engblom et al. because they use different
model parameters and numerics, and Engblom et al. does not pro-
vide information about their mesh. In contrast, conclusive TPDF-ver-
sus-no-model comparisons can be obtained from the studies of
Mobus et al. [124] and Koo et al. [125].

PMobus et al. [124] simulates the jet of Evans et al. [123] with an
Eulerian-particle scalar TPDF approach, a Lagrangian-particle veloc-
ity-scalar TPDF approach, and the no-model approach. They follow
the approach of Hsu et al. [122] to model pressure(cid:1)dilatation and,
unlike Hsu et al. who neglects viscous heating, Mobus et al. models
it. Moreover, they use a seven-step chemical mechanism. Mobus
et al. finds that the velocity-scalar TPDF provides the more accurate
predictions for the species mass fractions, followed by the scalar
TPDF approach, and then by the no-model approach. This is observed
throughout the flame but in particular at the edge of the jet. Interest-
ingly, it is in this region where the more intense turbulent fluctua-
tions would occur (no rms velocity data is provided by Mobus et al.
though) and, thus, where the representation of the fluctuating com-
ponent of scalars in RANS would be important. In other words, it is
in this region where the effect of the turbulent-combustion model
would be expected to be more pronounced, as indeed seen by Mobus
et al. With RANS, as used by Mobus et al., such intense and unsteady
turbulent fluctuations are represented in the TPDF model with the
unsteady set of equations given by Eq. (6.3)(cid:1)(6.5). Thus, it appears
that it is the better representation of the physics by TPDF that allows
it to provide more accurate predictions than the no-model approach
in this problem. Note that this is just one of many examples in which
such a feature of TPDF have done so [47], and a couple more are dis-
cussed later on. Koo et al. [125] also simulates the jet of Evans et al.
with a scalar TPDF approach and the first approach of Section 6.3
(Pisgs D (cid:2)sgs D 0), although with 3D LES not 2D RANS as Mobus et al.
Koo et al. uses a nineteen-step chemical-kinetics model for hydro-
gen-air combustion. They observe (their Fig. 4) almost no enhance-
ment of the accuracy of their predictions for the species mass
fractions when using TPDF instead of the no-model approach, except
at the centerline for H2 where TPDF is more accurate. Therefore,
these two sets of TPDF results for the jet of Evans et al. indicate that

Pfor this problem TPDF provides significantly more accurate predic-
tions in RANS but not LES. However, the fact that the TPDF and no-
model predictions of the LES of Koo et al. are so close to each other,
and that both agree very well with the experiments (although only
predictions of the mass fractions of O2 and H2 are given) could also
be an indication that their mesh is fine enough to resolve the rele-
vant physics. A grid sensitivity study would have helped to deter-
mine the role of the TPDF model in the LES of Koo et al.

PThe RANS studies of Hsu et al. [122] and Mobus et al. [124]
attempt to model the interaction between combustion and strong
flow compressions and expansions at the subgrid (LES) or fluctuating
(RANS) level by using the second approach of Section 6.3 to model
Shspd, albeit with models developed for nonreacting flows. In con-
trast, the LES study of Koo et al. [125] ignores this interaction by
using the first approach of Section 6.3. Neglecting this interaction is
invoked by all the LES-TPDF studies discussed next. Koo et al.
acknowledges that this is a strong assumption but justifies it by
mentioning that it is accurate for compressible flows, although their
citation to support this claim is Hsu et al. [122] who, as just men-
tioned, does not neglect this subgrid or fluctuating level interaction.
Nonetheless, at first sight, the fact that the TPDF predictions of Koo
et al. agree well with experiments suggest that neglecting this inter-
action is valid. However, their TPDF predictions are so close to those
of the no-model approach to indicate, as discussed above, that the
relevant physics are being resolved by the LES, and such physics
would include the interaction between combustion and flow com-
pressions and expansions. Thus, it cannot be concluded from the
study of Koo et al., neither from their arguments nor their results,
that this interaction can in general just be ignored with LES when
simulating the jet of Evans et al. [123].

PMobus et al. [124] also uses their approach above to simulate the
challenging supersonic jet flame of Cheng et al. [85], cf. discussions
of Figs. 7 and 9. Unlike their results for the jet of Evans et al., it is
unclear from their predictions of the jet of Cheng et al. for tempera-
ture, shown in Fig. 20, and species mass fractions (not shown) at two
streamwise planes if TPDF performs better than the no-model
approach. Indeed, it appears that in overall the no-model approach
provides more accurate predictions for mean temperature. In addi-
tion, the scalar TPDF approach seems to perform better than the
velocity-scalar approach, a result which contrasts with their finding
for the jet of Evans et al. discussed above. To explain these unsatis-
factory results, notice in Fig. 7 that at the x=D D 21.5 measurement
plane there is a strong coupling between high heat-release regions
(in red) and strong flow compressions and expansions (dark). Thus,
the unsatisfactory predictions of TPDF at this plane shown in Fig. 20
could be due to the misrepresentation of the interaction between
combustion and flow compressions and expansions at the fluctuat-
ing level (Mobus et al. uses RANS) by a model developed for non-
reacting flows. It would have been interesting to see in Mobus et al.
the sensitivity to using or not their submodels for these interactions.
However, as discussed in Section 4.2, it is very likely that unsatisfac-
tory predictions for the jet flame of Cheng et al. [85] such as those of
Mobus et al. are due to uncertainties in the inflow. Therefore, model-
ing errors cannot be always ascribed to those from the turbulent-
combustion modeling.

PTPDF has also been used in several studies to simulate scramjet-
like problems [125,126,129,227,229(cid:1)231]. Among these studies,
only the following ones make comparisons with experiments. Donde
et al. [126] considers the cavity scramjet of Micka & Driscoll
[127,128] when using hydrogen as the fuel. They use LES-TPDF with
the IEM model and the first approach of Section 6.3 to model Shspd
and the multi-environment-PDF method. Micka & Driscoll observe
that at low stagnation temperatures the flame stabilizes at the
upstream edge of the cavity and there is strong heat release in the
cavity shear layer. They call this cavity-stabilized combustion and it
is shown in Fig. 21a. In contrast, at high stagnation temperatures

Pthey see flame stabilization in the wake downstream of the fuel
injection location, a case they call jet-wake-stabilized combustion,
shown in Fig. 21b. Donde et al. simulates jet-wake-stabilized com-
bustion. They use a nineteen-step mechanism for hydrogen-air com-
bustion. Fig. 22 shows that, as revealed by maps of OH mass fraction,
the TPDF simulations produce a flame stabilized at approximately
two step heights downstream of the fuel injection location, a result
which is consistent with Fig. 21b. In contrast, the no-model approach
produces a flame that gets stabilized right downstream of the fuel
injection location, unlike the experimental observations. In other
words, the no-model approach gives combustion where it should
not be happening, and does so in the critical flame-stabilization
region. Donde et al. explains that the better performance of TPDF in
this problem is due to its ability to capture subgrid fluctuations
ignored by the no-model approach. This is the same explanation

Pgiven above for the better performance of TPDF over the no-model
approach in simulations of jet of Evans et al. [123], but applied to
subgrid fluctuations in LES instead of turbulent fluctuations in RANS.
Strong fluctuations near the wall captured by TPDF and not by the
no-model approach is also consistent with the fact that turbulence
fluctuations are strong near walls (e.g., Ref. [216] p. 286 and
Ref. [232] p. 130). When considering regions other than the flame-
stabilization zone, Fig. 22 shows that the no-model approach produ-
ces higher levels of OH all throughout in comparison with TPDF.
Thus, it is difficult to attribute the better prediction of flame stabili-
zation by TPDF solely to the near-wall modeling, cf. Section 5.4. In
this problem, the turbulent-combustion modeling plays a role, and a
major one indeed. Nonetheless, and again, this conclusion could
have been put in firmer ground if Donde et al. would have provided
a grid sensitivity study showing a potential improvement of the no-
model results as the mesh is refined.

In a similar study to that by Donde et al. [126], Koo et al. [125]
conducts LES-TPDF simulations with the multi-environment PDF
method of the scramjet of Micka & Driscoll [127,128] but considers
two operating conditions instead of one. They use the IEM model.
Fig. 23 (top) shows that their simulations predict that at a high stag-
nation temperature the largest temperature region is located near
the downstream edge and most of it lies outside the cavity (dark red
regions). In contrast, Fig. 23 shows that at a low stagnation tempera-
ture the largest temperature zone is located near the upstream edge
of the cavity and inside the cavity. Equivalent trends are seen with
maps of OH mass fraction. Even though it is not straightforward to
compare the temperature maps of Koo et al. shown in Fig. 23 with
the flame-luminosity images in Fig. 21, it can be said that the

Pallows TPDF to easily achieve this important change of flame behav-
ior without altering the model formulation. Thus, Koo et al. demon-
strates the capability of TPDF to simulate problems such as the
scramjet of Micka & Driscoll in a way that it would be ultimately
used in practice: to study trends at different operating conditions
with physics not necessarily known a

priori.

conditions. However,

PKoo et al. [129] simulates the UTRC scramjet with LES, scalar
TPDF, and the multi-environment PDF method. In this geometry,
the flame is stabilized in a cavity formed by a step upstream and
a ramp downstream. The fuel is ethylene and its combustion is
modeled with a fourteen-species chemical mechanism. Their sim-
ulations predict well the wall pressure variation in the stream-
they
wise direction at nonreacting
overpredict it by about 50% at reacting conditions. Koo et al.
observes that in their reacting simulations a complex shock struc-
ture oscillates upstream-and-downstream and interacts with the
flame in the cavity. Presumably such an interaction is not seen in
experiments corresponding to the conditions used by Koo et al.,
but it is seen for a different ramp-angle of the cavity. Thus, Koo
et al. attributes the above unsatisfactory prediction to uncertain-
ties in the boundary conditions, perhaps the inflow. Unfortu-
nately, the experimental data used by Koo et al. appears to be
unpublished, preventing further scrutiny. Nonetheless, Koo et al.
does point to the conclusion that factors other than the turbu-
lent-combustion model can introduce errors into the simulations.
Moreover, in contrast with a previous similar conclusion in the
study of Mobus et al. [124], the errors documented by Koo et al.
are quite significant.

PAs done in Section 5.4 for flamelets, consider first flames of mod-
erate turbulence intensity before moving onto those of high turbu-
lence intensity. The set of premixed flames by Cheng et al. [85] have
been simulated with TPDF in various studies [130,234(cid:1)236]. The
conditions of these three flames are indicated in Fig. 4 with filled tri-
angles and they are denoted as F3, F2 and F1 in order of increasing
turbulence intensity (ordinates in Fig. 4). Based both on their loca-
tion in Fig. 4 and their observed features, flame F3 is flamelet-like
and F1 is close to the distributed-reaction-zones regime [130]. The

a high (top) and low (bottom) stagnation temperature corresponding to jet-wake-sta-
bilized combustion (top) and cavity-stabilized combustion (bottom). This is Fig. 8 in
Ref. [125]. It is reprinted with permission from Elsevier.

Psimulations of Koo et al. appear to predict the change of behavior as
seen in the experiments from jet-wake-stabilized combustion to
cavity-stabilized combustion produced by a decrease of the inlet
stagnation temperature. (A more precise comparison can be made
by considering the hydrogen-ethylene case of Micka & Driscoll
[127,128] instead of the pure hydrogen case and compare with the
CH maps [233] given by the experimentalists.) This sort of qualita-
tive comparison with experiments contrasts with the detailed quan-
titative comparisons discussed in Section 5.4 for flamelet models.
However, although qualitative, it is remarkable for two reasons.
First, a change of flame behavior that is consistent with the experi-
ments is captured, not the features of a flame operating at a single
operating condition. Second, capturing such changes of flame behav-
ior involves resolving the physics of both premixed and nonpre-
mixed

Pstudy of Dodoulas et al. [130] is considered here since it is the most
comprehensive among the ones just cited. Dodoulas et al. simulates
all flames with LES, the stochastic-Eulerian-fields method, and the
IEM micromixing model. They use a fifteen-step chemical mecha-
nism for methane-air combustion. Fig. 24 shows their predictions
for streamwise velocity, which is indicative of the effect of heat
release on the flow. In Fig. 24 results with ND1 are equivalent to
those of the no-model approach, and those denoted with ND4 or
16 indicate the number of stochastic fields used. Fig. 24 indicates
that the accuracy of the predictions is improved by using TPDF
instead of the no-model approach in the F2 and F3 flames, both of
which are flamelet-like flames. Equivalent predictions have been
obtained with other simulations [234,235], although these simu-
lations use RANS and produce stronger sensitivities to the micro-
mixing-model constants to those reported by Dodoulas et al. with
LES. The fact that the TPDF and no-model predictions of Dodoulas
et al. for the flamelet-like flames differ, and that the former agree
better with experiments than the latter, discards the possibility
that such good prediction of TPDF is solely due to using a LES that
is capturing all the relevant combustion scales. Therefore, Dodou-
las et al. LES simulations of the flames of Cheng et al. show that
TPDF enhances the predictions of the no-model approach for
flamelet-like flames. Hence, even though TPDF cannot represent
the microstructure of flamelet-like premixed flames,
it can
Xprovide adequate predictions for such flames, and do so without
flamelet models such as Eq. (6.14) but with the simple IEM model.
Regarding the F1 flame which is closer to the distributed-reac-
tion-zone regime, Fig. 24 shows that predictions of TPDF and the
no-model are close to each other, and the latter appears to be
more accurate. It is not clear why such is the case, but it might be
related to the following TPDF results for distributed-reaction-like
flames.

PMoving onto high-turbulence-intensity premixed flames, TPDF
studies have considered the challenging premixed piloted flames of
Dunn et al. [11,24] shown in Fig. 3 [131,237,238]. The study of Row-
inski et al. [131] is considered here since it is comprehensive. Rowin-
ski et al. uses both RANS and LES, but the following refers only to
their LES results. They simulate the four flames of Dunn et al. [11,24]
using a Eulerian-mesh-Lagrangian-particle method with the IEM
model and a sixteen-species chemical mechanism. Overall, Rowinski
et al. obtains very accurate predictions for radial profiles of thermo-
chemical quantities for the flame PM1-50 which is near the bound-
ary between the thickened-reaction-zone and distributed-reaction-
zone regimes, cf. the filled circle in Fig. 4 at the lowest ordinate
value. However, these good predictions degrade as one moves fur-
ther into the distributed-reaction-zone regime when going from
flame PM1-100, to PM1-150, and finally to PM1-200. In fact, Rowin-
ski et al. documents the need to increase the IEM mixing model con-
stant, Ciem in Eq. (6.11), from a typical value of 5 (e.g., Koo et al. [125]
and Donde et al. [126] discussed above use 3 and 5 respectively) to
50 or 100 in order to get fair agreement between their predictions
and measurements for flames PM1-150 and PM1-200. The need to
do so is demonstrated in Fig. 25 which shows how the streamwise
variation of the fuel-consumption index predicted by the simula-
tions gets closer to the experimental values by increasing the IEM
constant (moving from dark to light grey lines). The fuel-consump-
tion index is a useful indicator of how much the reaction has pro-
gressed and it has a value of 0 in the reactants and 1 in the products.
Thus, Fig. 25 indicates that TPDF simulations burn more vigorously
than the experiments. The need to increase the values of Ciem in this
way could be an indication that the assumptions of the micromixing
model are inconsistent with the physics of distributed-reaction-like
combustion, or that it is compensating for flaws in other parts of the
model. Note that such assumptions include micromixing and macro-
mixing processes unaffected by combustion at the subgrid level. In
fact, Rowinski et al. acknowledges that in this problem “the mixing

Pfrequency is dominated by scales different from that in [Eq. (6.11) of
the present paper]”. In such case, further study and perhaps a revi-
sion of the TPDF submodels is needed to simulate distributed-reac-
tion-like flames.

PThe studies reviewed in this section and their corresponding dis-

cussions lead to the following conclusions:

P1. TPDF simulations give predictions more accurate than the no-
model approach in three [124,126,130] out of five case studies
[124(cid:1)126,130].

P2. In two of these three studies [124,126], which includes a case
where the TPDF accuracy is significantly superior to that of the
no-model approach [126], TPDF provides enhanced predictions
due to its capability to approximate scalar fluctuations in (not
highly-resolved) LES and RANS.

P3. The ability of TPDF to capture the multiple physics of high-
speed-combustion problems is demonstrated in a pair of TPDF
simulations [125] showing a change of flame behavior from
(predominantly) premixed to nonpremixed that is consistent
with those seen in experiments.

P4. Studies of premixed flames under moderate turbulence intensi-
ties show that it cannot be said that in general the lack of micro-
structure of TPDF leads to inaccurate predictions [130,131].
P5. TPDF studies of scramjet-like geometries do not compare quan-
titatively their predictions for combustion metrics with experi-
ments [125,126]. In addition, a study of a distributed-reaction-
like flame shows predictions that cannot be deemed satisfactory
[131]. Thus, it appears necessary to further test and improve the
TPDF framework for the simulation of high-speed combustion.
P6. The effect of submodels for the subgrid (LES) or fluctuating
(RANS) level interaction between combustion and flow com-
pressions and expansions has not been documented. Therefore,
since modeling this interaction appears to be necessary for prac-
tical simulations, as discussed in Section 3, it seems worthwhile
to study such an effect. For this purpose, because available mod-
els assumed a nonreacting flow, it appears reasonable to develop
new ones for reacting flows, cf. also Section 2.

P7. TPDF simulations of a distributed-reaction-like flame obtain fair
predictions, but only with the use of an IEM mixing model con-
stant an order of magnitude larger than typical values. Hence,
further study or potential new development of micromixing
models might be needed.

P8. As seen in the above flamelet studies, care must be taken in not
attributing the overall modeling error only to the turbulent-
combustion model, cf. above discussions of Refs. [124] and
[129].

PThe key challenge TPDF faces to simulate high-speed-combustion
problem is the development of the submodels just mentioned. To
explain the above challenge, it is important to reiterate that TPDF
has “no explicit representation of the micro-structure” [239]. As a
result, all terms in Eq. (6.2) containing conditioned gradients need
closure, which leads to the need of submodels for phenomena such
as micromixing and subgrid (LES) or fluctuating (RANS) interactions
between combustion and strong flow compressions and expansions.
The design of these submodels is not trivial. D
XAlthough the IEM model
is simple, later ones such as MMC are fairly complex. This can be
seen by a comparison of Eq. (6.11) for IEM and Eqs. (6.12)(cid:1)(6.13) for
MMC. Moreover, as the discussion of Zeman’s model for flow com-
pression and expansions in Section 3 shows, numerous assumptions
need to be taken to simplify the model formulation. For instance, in
Zeman’s model it becomes convenient to neglect combustion, an
assumption which is taken by other similar models, cf. Section 3.
XFurthermore, the subgrid (in LES) or fluctuating (in RANS) time and
length scales dictated by the fluid mechanics and combustion need
to be inserted into these submodels. The need for this practice is evi-
dent based, for example, on the results from Poludnenko [155], Kolla
et al. [156] and Luo [26] discussed in Section 2 showing the effect of
turbulence on combustion and vice versa. Inserting such scales is
done, for instance, by doing the following: designing an adequate
form of the tensor Gij in the macromixing model given by Eq. (6.7)
through, say, the use of relevant DNS data; providing a representa-
tive turbulent time-scale tT to be used in the macromixing model
represented by Eq. (6.8) or the micromixing models given by Eqs.
(6.11) or (6.13); or providing the characteristic length-scales lx or lcr
in Eq. (6.12) of the MMC micromixing model. Another example on
how these turbulent and combustion scales are inserted is the use of
flamelet solutions in the micromixing model given by Eq. (6.14),
although, as explained, above this appears to be unnecessary in

some cases. D
XIn contrast,
late high-speed combustion will be very challenging.
neither flamelets nor LEM and ODT need such type of submodels.
XHowever, in defense of TPDF, there is no fundamental reason why
such submodels cannot be developed. D

reason why the hybrid-model idea discussed at the end of Section 5.4

(6.13) and (6.14) implied a hybridization. In such case, a base TPDF
formulation could be used everywhere and, if a local error in, say, a
region where the interaction between combustion and strong flow
compressions and expansions is important is deemed too large, then
a local DNS or highly-resolved no-model LES simulation could be
conducted there. In this way, the need to develop submodels for this
interaction is replaced by conducting another type of simulation.

PThere is another challenge when using TPDF in high-speed-com-
bustion problems that is not discussed above: TPDF is computation-
ally expensive. TPDF typically uses notional-fluid particles to
represent the joint PDF of Na thermochemical quantities and advan-
ces equations for each of these particles. Thus, when using the com-
mon Lagrangian-particle-Eulerian-mesh approach, the cost of TPDF
scales with the number of particles per LES or RANS cell Np. Follow-
ing a similar reasoning, the cost of TPDF when using instead the sto-
chastic-Eulerian-field method scales with the number of stochastic
fields Nf [240]. As a result, TPDF is Np or Nf times more expensive
than the no-model approach, which is used as a benchmark here. In
practice, values used for Np are 20(cid:1)30 with composition PDFs, and
roughly 100 with velocity-composition PDFs [47]. Thus, TPDF is

Pabout an order of magnitude more computationally expensive than
the no-model approach. One way to reduce the cost of TPDF is to
combine it with a model of less cost, such as the no-model approach,
using the hybrid-model idea discussed at the end of Section 5.4.
Another way is to rely on moment methods [63], also called multi-
environment PDF methods, such as those used in the simulations of
Donde et al. [126] and Koo et al. [125] discussed above. With these
methods the PDF is represented as a weighted sum of the product of
various delta functions that includes various parameters with their
own governing equations:

ronments, wn is the probability of the environment n, can is the
mean of the thermochemical quantity ca in the environment n, and
Na is the total number of thermochemical quantities. The computa-
tional cost of this method scales with Ne. Therefore, since the values
of Ne used in practice (2 or 3) are significantly less than the values
used for Np with the popular Lagrangian-particle-Eulerian-mesh
approach, moment methods can make TPDF more computationally
affordable. However, this desirable feature comes with the expense
of reducing the broad-range of applicability characteristic of TPDF,
as discussed elsewhere [142,240]. (For example, with two environ-
ments, i.e. Ne D 2; three-mixing problems and partially-premixing
cannot be captured.) Another method to reduce the cost of TPDF is
to use the MMC micromixing model. In this case, for reasons dis-
cussed in Section 6, it has been demonstrated that the total number
of particles required in the computational domain is roughly an
order of magnitude less than the total number of LES or RANS cells
[224]. In other words, the cost of TPDF is of the order of that of the
no-model approach. This demonstrates the advantage of using low-
dimensional-manifold concepts to reduce computational cost. How-
ever, by the same token, the challenge of properly defining reduced
parameters, discussed in Section 5.4 for flamelets, which in general
is not an issue with TPDF, is brought into the TPDF modeling. There-
fore, ways to reduce the cost of TPDF are available, but they come
with the expense of deteriorating some of the desirable features of
this modeling framework.

7. Linear eddy model and one dimensional turbulence

7.1. Key equations

PThe main feature of the Linear Eddy Model (LEM) and the One-
Dimensional-Turbulence (ODT) approach is a spatial representation
of the reacting flow defined on a 1D domain. This domain is referred
to from now on as LEM domain or LEM array. Early subgrid imple-
mentations of LEM use a circular and periodic 1D domain [49], but

Fig. 26. LEM and ODT simulations use a 1D domain (thin grey line) consisting of a
stack of wafers (LEM elements) per computational LES or RANS cell (thick black line).

Pmore recent subgrid implementations use a 1D domain consisting of
an array or stack of wafers [50], with an inflow at one end, and an
outflow at the other end, as clarified later. These wafers are called
from now on LEM elements. There is one array per computational
LES or RANS cell, as pictured in Fig. 26. There are alternatives to this
arrangement [51,52,140,241,242], but they are not considered until
the end of Section 7. These arrays are isolated from each other dur-
ing a portion of the time advancement of the LEM equations, and
thereafter exchange information at a later portion. This issue is dis-
cussed shortly. In LEM and ODT, it is in these spatial structures
where reaction, micromixing, and macromixing (subgrid turbulence
in LES and turbulence in general in RANS) take place, and can do so
in a fully-coupled way at the subgrid or fluctuating level.

PTo explain how this happens, consider the most complete formu-
lation in the LEM and ODT framework: compressible ODT [136].
Note that this formulation has not been coupled yet with LES or
RANS but has been used only in stand-alone mode. This formulation
is used here for explanation purposes because it helps to highlight
the various assumptions made by typical formulations. This com-
pressible ODT formulation can be seen as composed by the following
equations and algorithms:

P(cid:4) The averaged fields are computed from the LES or RANS conser-
vation equations, e.g. Eqs. (3.1)(cid:1)(3.4). In LES (RANS) these fields
can be thought as large-scale (mean) fields, to which LEM and
ODT provide subgrid-scale (fluctuating) information.

P(cid:4) The subgrid (in LES) or fluctuating (in RANS) part of the flow is
governed by, among others, the conservation equations in their
1D form:

A pictorial continuous and discrete definition of the triplet is
given in Fig. 27. The effect of the triplet map on a flow property
profile defined in 1⁄2x0; x0 C l(cid:6) is to replace the profile with three
compressed images of the original with the middle image
flipped. This is how the compressive and rotational motions
observed in turbulent flows are represented in LEM and ODT
[244]. This mapping is selected because it is the simplest one
satisfying physical and mathematical constraints such as obey-
ing conservation laws, having continuous property profiles and
preventing multiplicative increases of property gradients of
order greater than one. The kernel function K(x) is given by KðxÞ
D x¡MðxÞ and, together with the coefficients cx, cy, and cz, rep-
resents the energy redistribution between velocity components
induced by pressure.

P(cid:4) Triplet maps are parameterized by a location x0 and a length l, cf.
Fig. 27. They are implemented in a stochastic way as follows.
(This is done in a stochastic way because it is computationally
efficient, but could also be done in a deterministic way.) First, x0
is sampled from a uniform (random-number) distribution. Sec-
ond, in LEM l is sampled from a distribution such as

which results from Kolmogorov’s scalings in the inertial range
[245]. Reasonable assumptions are to take lp as the Kolmogorov
length scale and l max as a characteristic local grid spacing (tur-
bulence length scale) of the LES (RANS). In ODT l can be sampled
from [246]

where l min is the minimum size of the triplet map and typical val-
ues are b D ¡2 and g D ¡b=ðb C 1Þ. Finally, having sampled x0
and l, the triplet map is implemented if its overall eddy rate per
unit domain length, defined by the later Eqs. (7.11) and (7.12), is
large enough, otherwise it is not implemented. In this way, the
distributions of x0 and l can take different forms (i.e. different
assumptions can be made to design them), since the physics are
embodied in this eddy rate.

P(cid:4) In LEM the overall eddy rate per unit domain length, λlem, is
obtained through dimensional reasoning and by invoking Kol-
mogorov’s scalings in the inertial subrange (e.g. the time scale of
an eddy t scales as t » l2/3). It is computed with

Here r0 is a reference density (computed from the local density),
Ekin and Ebaroclinic represent, respectively, the kinetic energy and
potential energy of an eddy event (triplet map), and Evisc is a cor-
rection that prevents the implementation of eddies (much)
smaller than Kolmogorov eddies. Codt and Z are model constants.
It is important to note that Ekin, Ebaroclinic and Evisc are functions
dependent on the local state of the flow in the 1D array. Their
form is discussed elsewhere [136,246].

P(cid:4) Another ingredient of a LEM or ODT formulation is an algorithm
that transfers subgrid (in LES) or fluctuating (in RANS) quantities
that are defined in the LEM array but not necessarily at the LES
or RANS level. In other words, these are quantities that are not
governed by averaged equations but by Eqs. (7.1)(cid:1)(7.7). A typi-
cal example of such quantities are the species mass fractions. Of
the various algorithms proposed [51,52,140,241,242], the splic-
ing algorithm [49,50] has been demonstrated to be robust for
practical combustion implementations. In principle, it is applica-
ble to both LEM and ODT, but has only been implemented in
LEM. Basically, the splicing algorithm cuts and pastes the end
portions of LEM arrays of adjacent LES or RANS cells, resulting in
an upwind and Lagrangian algorithm that enforces mass conser-
vation. Decisions on how much to cut and paste are based on
the values of the mass fluxes across the faces of LES or RANS
computational cells. Thus, the mass transfer produced by the
splicing D
Xapproximates that given by the LES or RANS solution.
For example, consider the face between two adjacent LES or
RANS cells A and B. (Recall there are LEM arrays defined inside
these cells.) If the mass flux at this face is large and directed
from A to B, a large portion of the LEM array in A will be cut and
then pasted onto one of the two endpoints of the array in B. If
this mass flux were small, a small portion would be cut and
pasted. In this way, the LEM arrays get aligned with the local
advective flux given by the LES or RANS. In other words, this
algorithm lets the LEM arrays “see” the LES or RANS flow in the
form of values for the flow properties defined at the end ele-
ments of the array. Having explained the basics, the following
are the five main steps of the splicing algorithm. First, order the
mass fluxes at the faces of a given cell, called from now on cur-
rent cell, from highest (positive outflow) to lowest (negative
inflow). Second, for a given mass flux, compute the number of
LEM elements that need to be fluxed out. Third, if a fraction of a
LEM element or wafer needs to be fluxed out, then split the
wafer according to some constraints. Fourth, paste the LEM ele-
ments, or fraction of a LEM element, from the outflow part of
the LEM (1D) domain in the current cell, to the inflow part of the
corresponding domain in the neighbor cell. Fifth, regrid the LEM
domain to obtain a uniform grid. Finally, repeat this process for
each of the positive outflows.

P(cid:4)
Eqs. (7.1)(cid:1)(7.5) are time advanced by using flow-property values at
the end points of the LEM (1D) domain as set by the splicing algo-
rithm and with zero-flux boundary conditions at these end points.
This type of boundary condition is used because it is consistent with
the idea that these arrays are isolated from each other during this
portion of the time advancement. Note, however, that these arrays
do exchange information between them, but do so through the LES
or RANS fields and the splicing algorithm.

P(cid:4) The last element of a LEM or ODT formulation is a transfer of
information from the LEM arrays to the LES or RANS through

eca

where the summation (index i) is over the elements of the LEM

fractions only.

PA LEM algorithm

P1. RANS/LES ! LEM transfer: Transfer information from the RANS/
LES simulation (ksgs, l max; and face mass-fluxes) to the LEM sim-
ulation.

P2. LEM-level in same RANS/LES cell: Using a time-splitting tech-
nique, iteratively distort the flow-property profiles according to
Eqs. (7.7)(cid:1)(7.12), and time advance Eqs. (7.1)(cid:1)(7.6).

P3. LEM-level among adjacent RANS/LES cells: Transfer information
between LEM arrays in adjacent LES or RANS cells using the
splicing algorithm. This step is usually followed by various algo-
rithms to reduce computational cost.

P4. LEM ! RANS/LES transfer: Transfer LEM information to the

RANS/LES level with Eq. (7.13).

7.2. Basic assumptions

P(cid:4) The building block of LEM and ODT is a 1D spatial structure to
approximately represent the subgrid flow in LES or the fluctuat-
ing flow in RANS. This structure allows the full 1D resolution of
various physical phenomena with Eqs. (7.1)(cid:1)(7.13) while keep-
ing the simulations computationally tractable. By full resolution
it is meant that the time- and length-scales of combustion phys-
ics are captured with the 1D LEM structure, not that solving Eqs.
(7.1)(cid:1)(7.13) is equivalent to a DNS.

P(cid:4) LEM and ODT do not invoke low-dimensional-manifold assump-

tions and they do not need to assume PDF shapes.

P(cid:4) LEM and ODT are based on unsteady equations, Eqs. (7.1)(cid:1)(7.5).
P(cid:4) The chemical source term, Sa, in Eq. (7.5) appears in closed form.
P(cid:4) Macromixing is simulated with a stochastic simulation that
instantaneously distorts property profiles in the LEM arrays
with triplet maps, cf. Eq. (7.7)(cid:1)(7.12).

P(cid:4) In ODT the eddy rate sampling, Eq. (7.12), is derived from
dimensional reasoning and energy conservation. As a result,
ODT reproduces (does not assume) Kolmogorov’s inertial-range
scalings in homogeneous, isotropic turbulence [244].

P(cid:4) ODT allows a two-way coupling at the subgrid (in LES) or fluctu-
ating (in RANS) levels between macromixing and phenomena
such as reaction and strong flow compressions and expansions
because the functions Ekin, Ebaroclinic and Evisc in Eq. (7.12) depend
on the local state of the subgrid or fluctuating flow in the LEM
array.

P(cid:4) In addition, the anisotropy due to the interaction of combustion
and strong flow compressions and expansions, cf. Section 2,
could be modeled in ODT with the quantities K(x), cx, cy, and cz
in Eq. (7.7). This idea has not been demonstrated, though.

or

RANS

P(cid:4) Because macromixing is usually forced to occur only within a
LES
above
(with
[51,52,140,241,242]), it has to be complemented with an algo-
rithm, such as the splicing algorithm, that implements the mass
transfer between adjacent LES or RANS cells.

exceptions

noted

cell

P(cid:4) Implied in the splicing algorithm is that the transport of mass
between adjacent LES or RANS cells is dominated by advection,
not molecular transport. Thus, a LES using LEM or ODT does not
approximate a DNS when the grid is refined.

P(cid:4) Micromixing is fully-resolved in the LEM or ODT grid with Eqs.
(7.1)(cid:1)(7.5). Hence, the effects of reaction, Schmidt number, and
Prandtl number on micromixing can be captured.

P(cid:4) LEM and ODT can capture flamelet regimes because Eqs. (7.1)(cid:1)
(7.5) without the triplet-mapping are the same as the flamelet
equations (when M ?
a

D 0), Eq. (5.3).

P(cid:4) In low-speed formulations, it is reasonable to neglect spatial
D 0 in

variations of pressure in the LEM arrays, and to take Shspd
Eq. (7.5).

P(cid:4) For high-speed combustion, LEM and ODT could be designed to
fully resolve (as defined in the first item), within the 1D approxi-
mation, subgrid (LES) or turbulent (RANS) interactions between
combustion and flow compressions and expansions with Eqs.
(7.5) and (7.6).

7.3. Further assumptions made by LEM

P(cid:4) In LEM the eddy size distribution, Eq. (7.9), and eddy sampling,
Eq. (7.11), are derived from dimensional reasoning and inertial-
range scaling laws. In other words, these scalings are built into
LEM.

P(cid:4) LEM typically does not evolve any velocity, i.e., ux D uy D uz D 0 in

Eqs. (7.1)(cid:1)(7.7). An exception is discussed shortly.

P(cid:4) As a result of the above two items, the LEM eddy rate per length
given by Eq. (7.11) depends only on the LES or RANS flow. Conse-
quently, LEM does not allow a two-way coupling at the subgrid
(in LES) or fluctuating (in RANS) level between macromixing
and phenomena such as reaction and strong flow compressions
and expansions.

P(cid:4) The approximation of subgrid (in LES) or fluctuating (in RANS)
interactions between combustion and flow compressions and
expansions is captured in LEM to some extent by the splicing, as
explain in one example of the challenges of LEM and ODT in Sec-
tion 7.5. Furthermore, such interactions can also be approxi-
mated by defining a velocity parallel to the 1D domain, i.e. ux,
and evolving it with Eqs. (7.2) and (7.7).

Psecond or third methods in Table 3. For this purpose, an energy
variable is defined in the LEM (1D) domain, in addition to that
(the averaged energy) defined at the LES or RANS level. More-
over, it is convenient and consistent to neglect pressure gra-
dients in the LEM (1D) domain, and assume that the pressure in
this domain is equal to that of its corresponding LES or RANS
cell. As a result there is no need for Eqs. (7.2) and (7.6) and the
formulation is significantly simplified. In this way, an increase of
temperature due to the combined effects of reaction and com-
pression, say, is captured with reaction being computed via Sa in
Eq. (7.5), and compression being modeled with Shspd
Shspd.
With this approach,
inconsistencies between the averaged
energy in the LES or RANS level and the average of the energy in
the LEM (1D) domain should be small. This is the case because
the same high-speed source term is being used in both levels, as
mentioned previously for TPDF in Section 6. Potential inconsis-
tencies should be monitored in practice, however. This approach
has been implemented, for example, by neglecting viscous heat-
ing [249] and by using the following temperature equation
instead of Eq. (7.5) (in which ca represents the energy variable):

Dm e

where cp is the heat capacity, qx is the heat flux and ST is the

P2. The most complete level of description in the LEM and ODT
framework computes Shspd in Eq. (7.5) using information from
the LEM (1D) domain:
@u
@x

rShspd

ð7:15Þ

C txx

:

With this approach, in contrast with the one above, it is neces-
sary to solve an equation for the velocity component parallel to
the LEM (1D) domain, Eq. (7.2), and for the pressure, Eq. (7.6).
Note that the terms in the right hand side of Eq. (7.15) are
approximations to the 3D terms ¡p@ui=@xi and tij(@ui/@xj),
approximations that imply modeling errors. (With ODT, how-
ever, two terms other than txx(@u/@x) can be added.) One exam-
ple of these errors is discussed in Section 7.5. An important
component of this way to compute Shspd is a method to prevent
the unphysical triplet-mapping of shocks. The prevention of this
artifact has been done by adding one more term inside the
square root of Eq. (7.12) [136]. This formulation is not typical in
LEM and has been tested in stand-alone simulations [136] but
not in those coupled with LES or RANS. For such coupling, con-
sistency between the averaged energy of the LES or RANS and
the average of the energy defined in the LEM (1D) domains could
be achieved, for example, by enforcing

Z

ð7:16Þ

where the integration is done over the LEM (1D) domain. In com-
parison with the previous approach, the present one resolves
with the LEM grid high-speed phenomena. Such type of resolu-
tion is only allowed by this formulation and that in the last col-
umn of Table 4 for flamelets. Thus, since high-speed-effects
submodels are unavailable for reacting flows, cf. Section 3, it is
advantageous to have a turbulent-combustion model with a
spatial structure to approximately capture these effects.

7.4. Ways to model Shspd

P1. One way to include the interaction between combustion and
flow compressions and expansions and viscous heating into
LEM and ODT is to model the Shspd term in Eq. (7.5) using only
information from the averaged fields. This corresponds to the

etries [132,133,145,146,250]. The following discusses two studies
that compare LEM predictions with those from a variation of the no-
model approach and experimental measurements. This variation of
the no-model approach is called the Eddy-Break-Up (EBU) model

Pfirst approach of Section 7.4 to model Shspd, by neglecting the subgrid
pressure-dilatation and viscous-heating terms in Table 2, and a two-
step mechanism for hydrogen. Fig. 11 shows the mean temperature
predictions of Genin et al. for LEM and EBU, as well as those from
other studies. Notice that at the xD11 mm station LEM underpre-
dicts the temperature, while EBU provides a better prediction. At the
two stations downstream EBU produces two symmetric reacting
layers (two peaks of mean temperature) that are not seen in the
experiments. Such a feature is also observed at the xD58 mm station
in the flamelet simulations of Berglund et al. [106]. In contrast, LEM
produces a single reacting wake as in the experiments. These differ-
ent predictions suggests the LEM produces a more intense mixing
near the centerline than EBU. In comparison, the LES-no-model sim-
ulations shown in Fig. 11 also produce a single reacting wake at
xD58 and xD156 mm, as well as the LES-PaSR simulations of Fureby
et al. [100] (not shown). However, this result is achieved by using
meshes 3(cid:1)20 times finer than that used by the LEM and EBU simula-
tions of Genin et al. [133]. Therefore, it can be said that there is some
intense mixing near the centerline that is not captured by the EBU
simulations of Genin et al. [133] because the grid is too coarse to
resolve the relevant flow structures there. Furthermore, this intense
mixing appears to be captured by their LEM simulations, but this is
done by using triplet maps and the splicing to approximately repre-
sent such flow structures. A grid sensitivity study by Genin et al.
[133] would have helped in making the previous statement more
convincing. Genin et al. [133] also shows that LEM gives a reaction-
zone width broader than the experiments and other simulations.
Thus, perhaps the mixing-representation of LEM, which provides
adequate predictions near the centerline, is mixing too much the
fluid at the edges of the wake. On the other hand, the wall boundary
conditions could also be responsible for this predictive error, as dis-
cussed in Section 4.2. (Genin et al. [133] does not document their
wall boundary conditions.) Further inspection of Fig. 11 shows that
in overall the LEM simulation does not produce more accurate pre-
dictions than similar LES-no-model simulations. However, as already
discussed, it is difficult to draw conclusions from simulations with
different meshes, numerics, and chemical mechanisms. Nonetheless,
at least for the two simulations in which various parameters other
than those related to the turbulent-combustion model are kept the
same, Genin et al. [133] observes that LEM predicts a single reacting
wake as seen in the experiments while EBU produces a double react-
ing layer.

PIn addition to the above scramjet simulations, LEM has been
applied to difficult detonation and shock prolems. D

studies discussed above do. EBU computes the average chemical

PChoi et al. [132] considers two operating conditions of the AD
XFRL-
cell-18 scramjet test. Notably, this study and that by Koo et al. [125]
are the only ones among those discussed here that simulate more
than one operating condition in scramjet problems. Choi et al. uses
LES with the first approach of Section 7.4 to model Shspd, which
neglects the subgrid pressure-dilatation and viscous-heating terms
in Table 2, and a seven-step mechanism for ethylene. In the scramjet
considered, fuel is injected at the wall at some angle with the wall
normal, and this is done at a location upstream of a cavity which sta-
bilizes the flame. The two operating conditions differ on the level of
fuel-injection pressure and consequent value of the global equiva-
lence ratio. In the high-fuel-injection-pressure case the combustion
is seen to occur closer to the injector than at the lower-pressure
case, presumably due to better mixing in that region due to the high
fuel-injection pressure. As a result, the experiments show that in the
former case an increase of wall pressure occurs closer to the fuel-
injection location than in the latter case. Choi et al. observes that
both EBU and LEM predict a streamwise variation of wall pressure
consistent with this experimental trend, and that both predictions
are close to each other. (Note that in Fig. 2 of Choi et al. the red solid
line should be replaced by a red dashed line and vice versa [251].)
Nonetheless, they also see that both models underpredict the wall
pressure. In addition, Choi et al. observes that LEM gives larger val-
ues of the combustion efficiency than EBU, a result which indicates
more vigorous burning in the former, and that near the fuel injector
LEM produces small-scale pockets of high-temperature fluid not
seen with EBU. It cannot be determined which of these two sets of
combustion predictions is more accurate because there appears to
be no measurements of combustion metrics. Therefore, LEM and
EBU predict different combustion features, but produce very similar
streamwise variation of wall pressures that are consistent with two
operating conditions, although they underpredict the experimental
values. Since two different predictions of the combustion process
produce almost the same wall pressure variations, it can be conjec-
tured that the wall-pressure underprediction may be due to errors
from the modeling of physics other than turbulent combustion. In
fact, Choi et al. attributes this inaccuracy to a lack of resolution of
the shock upstream of the fuel injection location, in the isolator
region. Results from a grid sensitivity study would have been useful
in order to support this hypothesis. In addition, referring to a similar
underprediction of wall pressure discussed in Section 5.4, the near-
wall modeling and the neglect of the subgrid viscous-heating could
be considered as other causes of this underprediction seen by Choi
et al. Therefore, Choi et al. provides yet another example that model-
ing errors from sources other than the turbulent-combustion model
can be very important in scramjet-like problems.

PIn contrast with the AD

XFRL-cell-18 scramjet test, the combustion is
experimentally characterized in the DLR-wedge scramjet. This
allows a more precise discussion. Genin et al. [133] (also discussed
in Menon et al. [250]) considers this latter test and uses LES with the

PEq. (7.14) as the energy LEM equation. Note that Eq. (7.14) includes
the effect of average-pressure transients on the subgrid representa-
tion of the flow. Maxwell simulates the propagation of detonation
waves in unobstructed ambients, as well as in obstructed ambients
where deflagration-to-detonation transitions happen. The former
problem is considered here. (Detonation problems have also been
simulated with the no-model approach [252,253] and flamelet mod-
els [254,255].) It consists of a detonation wave propagating in a
channel filled with a methane-oxygen mixture. This propagation
results in an irregular pattern of cells produced by the presence of
turbulence. The irregularity can be appreciated in time-traces of the
speed of the detonation front along a particular streamwise line,
such as that shown in Fig. 28. Thus, this problem poses a stringent
test to model the interactions between turbulence, combustion and
strong flow compressions and expansions. Maxwell observes that
LEM predicts shock and vortical flow structures in good qualitative
agreement with experiments (not shown here) [135], although the
LEM simulations tend to show larger cell structures. Fig. 29a com-
pares PDFs of the speed of the detonation wave predicted with LEM
and the no-model approach with those from experiments with a
channel height of 193.6 mm [135]. These PDFs are constructed from
timetraces such as that in Fig. 28. Both LEM and no-model simula-
tions predict a most-probable speed, the largest peak in the PDF,
that is within that of the experimental value. However, at speeds
larger than this value the no-model approach predicts another PDF
peak not seen with LEM or in the experiments. Fig. 29b is similar to
Fig. 29a but for a channel with a width of 96.3 mm [256]. In this

Pcase, the agreement between LEM and experiments is better than
that seen in the wider channel. This better agreement, as explained
by Maxwell, may be due to the less variation of the detonation cell
sizes (less irregularity) in the narrow channel. The interpretation of
these comparisons of predictions with measurements, however,
should consider the following. First, the simulations use slip and adi-
abatic wall boundary conditions that do not represent the dissipative
processes happening in the experiments. Second, the experimental
PDF in the wider channel is computed from only four different
experiments. Finally, to obtain the LEM predictions in Fig. 29 the
model constant, Ck, of the closure model for the subgrid stress, tsgs
;
ij
used by Maxwell is increased from its typical values of 1:4¡2 to 6:7
¡10; an increase which produces more turbulent fluctuations. Note
that the same value of Ck is used in LEM and no-model simulations.
As in the discussion of Rowinski et al. [131], the use of constant val-
ues significantly different than those typically used usually (but not
always) indicates some missing physics. Maxwell explains that the
need of higher values of Ck is consistent with what is done in two-
dimensional-turbulence simulations, and the present experiments
are quasi-two-dimensional. In this case the need to increase D
XCk does
not imply some missing physics. On the other hand, he also argues
that this need to artificially generate more turbulent fluctuations is
consistent with the fact that the turbulence generation via barocli-
nicity, cf. Section 2, which is important in the interaction of detona-
tion waves with turbulence, is not taken into account by model
constants that are obtained from nonreacting, incompressible turbu-
lence. Therefore, Maxwell shows the capability of LEM to capture
several features of irregular detonation problems, but also indicates
that various open questions in the modeling of this difficult problem
remain, an interesting one being: Is there an effect of the interac-
tions between combustion, strong flow compressions and expan-
sions on the features of the turbulence and if so how can such be
modeled? An attempt on such modeling is conducted by Jozefik
et al. [136].

PJozefik et al. [136] uses the most general LEM and ODT model for
high-speed combustion, which is the compressible ODT model
explained above. They use it, however, in 1D simulations that are
not coupled to RANS or LES. In contrast, note that Maxwell [134]
conducts coupled LEM-with-LES simulations. Jozefik et al. simulates
the propagation of a shock in a tube in which initially a laminar
flame sits at a distance downstream of the shock but upstream from
the tube’s end wall. The flow consists of an initial interaction of the
shock with the laminar flame and, after the shock reflects from the
wall, a second interaction with what is now a turbulent flame. Thus,
the premixed flame is struck by shocks twice and, as a result, flame
instabilities develop, the flame surface is increased, which results in
an increase of the burning rate. This process is shown in Fig. 30 in
the form of the time trace of heat release. Results from both ODT and
the high-resolution 2D simulations of Khokhlov et al. [137] are
shown. The increases of heat release near 0.35 and 0.7 ms are pro-
duced when the shock interacts with the flame. The later sharp

Pincrease by 1.2 ms in ODT and 1.25 ms in the 2D simulations happen
due to a deflagration-to-detonation transition. Fig. 30 shows that
predictions of ODT and the simulations of Khokhlov et al. [137] for
the events just described are in good agreement, although the timing
of the events differ. Thus, the ODT simulations of Jozefik et al. are
approximately capturing the physics of interest. ODT is able to do so
because of its use of the set of 1D gas dynamic equations (Eqs. (7.1)(cid:1)
(7.6)) that allow for the propagation of shocks and their interaction
with combustion, and the inclusion of Ebaroclinic in Eq. (7.12), which
emulates the generation or destruction of turbulence from shock/
flame interactions via a baroclinic-generation term. (Jozefik et al.
[136] discusses further the physical interpretation of Ebaroclinic and
the need to use another term to prevent the unphysical triplet-map-
ping of shocks.) In fact, it is through the Ebaroclinic term that ODT could
represent the nonnegligible baroclinic torque and its effects in prob-
lems such as those considered by Poludnenko [155] (cf. Section 2)
and Maxwell [134] (discussed right above). Furthermore, by averag-
ing Eq. (7.15) ODT could be used to close the high-speed source term
for the LES or RANS equations. This closure can only be carried on
with ODT and perhaps flamelet modeling when using the fourth
approach of Section 5.3 to model Shspd. The latter approach, though,
has not been used to model the interaction of flames with strong
flow compressions and expansions. In addition, ODT could be use to
close other unclosed terms in Table 2 such as the subgrid stress ten-
sor, tsgs
[246,257]. Nonetheless, such a discussion is deemed outside
ij
the present scope for reasons explained in Section 3. To conclude,
the LEM and ODT framework has been capable of capturing complex
interactions among combustion, turbulence, and strong flow com-
pressions and expansions, and allows for the closure of the high-
speed source term in the LES or RANS equations. It is the use of its
characteristic 1D structure what allows such capabilities. Nonethe-
less, coupling simulations such as those by Jozefik et al. [136] with
LES or RANS must face the following difficult challenge.

PThe splicing algorithm relies on a cutting-and-pasting process
between 1D LEM domains using 3D information from the face-fluxes
of LES or RANS cells. With hexahedral cells for example, there are
two ends in a 1D domain and six faces in a cell. As a result, the splic-
ing could bring into contact fluid elements with very different com-
positions, violating composition locality. (For example, in the mixing
of two passive scalars an unmixed fluid blob could be brought imme-
diately adjacent in physical space to a fully-mixed fluid blob.) Such
artifacts can be expected to be mild if property-gradients at the LES
or RANS level are not too sharp [258]. However, this is not the case
when strong flow compressions and expansions occur. Thus, con-
sider a shock moving in a turbulent ambient. Furthermore, notice
that the LEM-and-ODT formulation explained above does not pre-
scribe any direction to the 1D domain, and recall that the splicing
sets the conditions at the ends of this domain using face mass fluxes.
Hence it is useful for the following to envision the LEM domains as
aligning themselves with the flow of mass. Such an alignment is not
known a priori and difficult to interpret in a complex flow. With
these clarifications, when using compressible ODT in this shock-flow
problem the splicing could bring a high-pressure LEM element in
between two low-pressure LEM elements. This could happen for the
same reason that the above violation of composition-locality could.
Moreover, for adequate conditions, this event could create a shock in
the 1D domain that propagates nearly in the same direction as that
at the LES or RANS level. A propagation in the exact same direction
cannot always be guaranteed with a 1D approximation of a 3D flow.
More importantly, the above event could also create a shock in the
1D domain propagating nearly in the opposite direction of the shock
at the RANS or LES level. Such artifacts could be accepted on the
grounds that all that ODT attempts to do there is to approximate the
interaction of combustion with flow compressions and expansions,
and that the proper propagation of a shock is being handled by the
RANS or LES. However, noticing that in the problems of present

tions of Srinivasan & Menon [138]. This is adapted from Fig. 5 in Ref. [138]. It is

Pinterest such interactions can significantly enhance the combustion,
as shown in the discussion of Fig. 6, ways to assess and mitigate
these artifacts must be devised. Furthermore, for this same reason,
these potential LEM-level-shock artifacts could be expected to be
more detrimental than the above issue of composition locality. Note
that the above LEM simulations by Choi et al. [132], Genin et al.
[133], and Maxwell et al. [134] do not have this problem because
they do not use compressible ODT but assume that different LEM
elements in the same LES cell have the same pressure. This problem
is one of several examples discussed here about the challenges to
reconcile a 1D description with a 3D flow. It is not clear yet how to
mitigate it, but perhaps a starting point is the set of approaches to
prevent artifacts from violation of composition locality [259(cid:1)261].

PSrinivasan & Menon [138] use LEM uncoupled to LES or RANS to
simulate turbulent flames over a wide range of conditions going
from flamelet-like flames to distributed-reaction-like flames. Fig. 31
(top) shows that for a flame with low turbulence intensity (Ka D 1:4),
at conditions denoted by the lower cross in Fig. 4, LEM produces a
flame structure similar to that of a laminar flame. Note that in Fig. 31
the red line is a solution for a laminar flame, and other lines are
instantaneous profiles produced by LEM. Such a reproduction of a
laminar flame structure, also seen elsewhere [262,263], results from
the fact that at low turbulence intensities the triplet maps are either

Pthe solution of Eq. (5.3). However, the solution of this 1D equation
cannot capture the curving of a flame front, which is also not cap-
tured by the 1D flamelet equations but can be approximated in
flamelet modeling with, for example, corresponding sources and
sinks in Eq. (5.5). The failure of LEM and ODT to capture flame curva-
ture in flamelet-like flames is shown in Fig. 32 (top-left frame),
which shows that the PDF of the flame curvature predicted by LEM
when coupled with LES (dashed dotted line) differs significantly
from that of DNS (solid line). Another example of such a failure is
found in ODT simulations uncoupled to LES or RANS which show a
significant underprediction of flame surface density when compared
with DNS [264]. This type of result is another example of the chal-
lenge of reconciling a 1D description with the 3D flow.

PMoving to flames of moderate turbulence intensity (Ka < 37), Sri-
nivasan & Menon [138] document a flame-thickness-versus-turbu-
lence-intensity curve that is consistent with one set of experiments,
and another one that is inconsistent with its corresponding set of
experiments. Since in the former comparisons the experiments use
no swirl, but do in the latter comparison, Srinivasan & Menon
explains that this discrepancy may be due to large-scale features of
the flow, such as the reduction of flame thickness due to the mean
strain, that cannot be captured by their LEM simulations. Therefore,
it would be interesting to make such a comparison using LEM when
coupled to LES or RANS.

PAt even higher turbulence intensities (Ka D 1193), for the condi-
tion denoted by the upper cross in Fig. 4, Fig. 31 (bottom) shows a
markedly different structure from that of a laminar flame. Further-
more, notice that such a structure, result of solving reaction-diffu-
sion equations and implementing triplet maps (Eqs. (7.1)(cid:1)(7.6)),
resembles that of a distributed-reaction-like flame shown in Fig. 5
from the experiments of Zhou et al. [25]. This type of distributed-
reaction-like flame structure has also been observed in LEM simula-
tions uncoupled to LES or RANS of supernovae flames [265] (their
Figs. 9(cid:1)11 and 14). In addition, Srinivasan & Menon show a broaden-
ing of the preheat zone when moving from flamelet-like flames to
distributed-reaction-like flames. This observation can be seen by
comparing the two frames in Fig. 31 but is more clear in Fig. 6d of
Srinivasan & Menon. More importantly, such an observation is con-
sistent with the experimental results of Skiba et al. [151] (their

PFig. 14). Lastly, it is interesting to notice that, at least for the condi-
tions considered by Ranjan et al. [139], Fig. 32 shows that the dis-
crepancy between LEM predictions (dashed-dotted lines) and DNS
(solid lines) for the PDF of the flame curvature, which is large at low
turbulence intensities, is not large anymore at higher turbulence
intensities. Thus, the studies of Srinivasan & Menon and Ranjan et al.
show that the LEM and ODT framework can capture premixed flames
from the flamelet-like regime to the distributed-reaction regime,
although some significant errors can be seen in the former regime.
Such errors could be reduced by accounting for flame curvature in
the LEM equations as done in other models [69] or by using an
approach discussed later on.

PThe present discussion of LEM and ODT modeling of high-speed

combustion leads to the following conclusions:

P1. A LEM study shows that, whereas a variation of the no-model
approach predicts a double reacting layer, LEM predicts a single
reacting wake as seen in the experiments [133]. This favorable
result is likely due to the use by LEM of a 1D subgrid structure to
approximately represent flow structures not captured with the
LES or RANS mesh.

P2. LEM and ODT simulations capture interactions between com-
bustion, turbulence, and strong flow compressions and expan-
sions consistent with those observed in experiments [134] and
high-resolution simulations [136]. Again this is due to their use
of a 1D subgrid structure.

P3. ODT can close both the average chemical source term and, nota-
bly, the average high-speed source term in the LES or RANS
equations, the latter of which implies using the fourth approach
to close Shspd in Table 3.

P4. LEM simulations not coupled with a LES or RANS predict various
features of premixed flames ranging from flamelet-like to dis-
tributed-reaction-like [138], although in the former type some
significant inaccuracies are seen.

P5. In spite of the above favorable outcomes, LEM and ODT has not
been tested to the same extent of flamelets or TPDF in high-
speed-combustion problems. Furthermore, one of the above
simulations of flame/shock interactions, and the above simula-
tions of distributed-reaction-like flames are not coupled to a LES

Por RANS. Thus, considerable work remains to demonstrate the
capabilities of LEM and ODT to simulate high-speed combustion.
P6. As seen in the above flamelet and TPDF studies, care must be
taken in not attributing the overall modeling error only to the
turbulent-combustion model, cf. above discussion of Refs. [132]
and [134].

P7. Coupling the 1D description of the subgrid (LES) or fluctuating
(RANS) flow in LEM and ODT with the 3D flow at the LES or
RANS level is perhaps the key challenge of applying LEM and
ODT to high-speed-combustion problems. This challenge of cou-
pling two (or more) different descriptions of physical phenom-
ena is common in multi-scale modeling [202].

POne approach to address this challenge is to follow the idea dis-
cussed at the end of Section 5.4: Compensate for the deficiencies of
one model in a particular physical regime by switching to another
one that would perform better. This idea is followed in the hybrid
model of Ranjan et al. [139] which differs from the classic implemen-
tation of LEM in LES in the following ways. First, LEM is used not to
compute the averaged thermophysical quantities with Eq. (7.13) but
to compute an average chemical source term, called from now on
the LEM chemical source term. Second, the conservation equations
for the averaged species, Eq. (3.4), which are not solved in classic
LEM, are time advanced. Third, the splicing is discarded since Eq.
(3.4) is being solved. Finally, the average chemical source term in Eq.
(3.4) is computed as a weighted average of the LEM chemical source
term and that computed with the no-model approach, Eq. (4.1).
With this hybrid approach, Fig. 32 shows that LEM (dashed-solid
lines) can be corrected into a formulation (dotted lines) that pro-
vides a more accurate PDF of flame curvature in a flamelet-like flame
interacting with decaying turbulence in a box when compared with
DNS (solid line). Nonetheless, it is important to note that it is unclear
how well this approach would work in highly-unsteady problems
(cf. Section 2) because, by dispensing with the splicing, the time-his-
tory of the LEM simulations happening inside the LES or RANS cells
is lost. However, the splicing could be well brought back into this
formulation.

PTo explain a second approach to address the above challenge,
consider a reacting flow moving predominantly parallel to an iso-
thermal cold wall. In this flow, the splicing brings into a LES or RANS
cell LEM elements from cells upwind in a direction parallel to the
wall. As a result, following a previous explanation, the LEM 1D struc-
ture can be envisioned as aligned in directions parallel to the wall.
Therefore, it cannot model large gradients in the wall-normal direc-
tion and, thus, it cannot be used to capture flame quenching. To cap-
ture this phenomenon it seems then reasonable to use, say, three
LEM domains inside the LES or RANS cell. In a more general sense,
such an approach would solve the inconsistency, discussed above, of
having a 1D description of the subgrid or fluctuating flow and a 3D
flow at the LES or RANS level, allowing thus to capture direction-
dependent physics such as flame quenching near a wall, buoyancy,
and shocks. However, a new problem arises: How to transfer the
information between three different LEM domains in a way that is
consistent with the physics at hand and does not introduce artifacts?
At first sight this appears to replace one problem with another one,
but an approach that could capture direction dependent physics at
the subgrid or fluctuating level perhaps should not be dismissed in
this way. In fact, preliminary studies have shown ways how to use
three LEM domains per LES or RANS cell [140,266], or even go fur-
ther and use a more complex arrangement that allows to dispense
with the LES or RANS altogether [241,242]. The following discusses
the former approach.

PSannan et al. [140] uses three LEM domains per RANS cell in an
approach they call LEM3D. Since three LEM domains are used, the
splicing as explained above is replaced by a different algorithm.
Sannan et al. simulates a round jet in which two heated and

Sannan et al. [140]. The two sets of results shown are for the 20 and 40 mm ring pair
(dashed line and closed symbols) and the 10 and 30 mm pair (dotted line and open

Pconcentric rings are placed with their faces lying on a plane parallel
to the jet-exit plane but at some distance downstream [141]. This
problem is a classic one of passive-scalar mixing and poses a strin-
gent test to turbulence models. In such a problem two passive sca-
lars can be defined and a key observable is the cross-correlation
between them. Since the scalars are passive, the information is
transferred only from the LES or RANS to the LEM. Thus, a steady-
state RANS solution may be sufficient to simulate this problem.
However, to focus on the errors of the LEM3D formulation and avoid
potential errors from RANS, Sannan et al. uses the velocity field pro-
vided by the experimentalists and maps it into a “RANS” mesh.
Fig. 33 shows predictions for the center-line cross-correlation coeffi-
cient obtained with LEM3D and experimental results for two differ-
ent conditions which depend on the diameters of the pair of rings
used. Overall the predictions are fairly accurate and the trends of
varying conditions are well captured. However, there is some con-
siderable discrepancy downstream where the cross-correlation
given by LEM3D gets closer to one at a faster rate than that seen in
the experiments. Sannan et al. explains that this discrepancy may be
due to dominant turbulent length-scales in the LEM3D simulations
slightly different from those in the experiments. However, judging
the accuracy of LEM3D in Fig. 33 must take into account the fact that
the RANS mesh used is very coarse since it has a spacing (8 mm) of
the order of the main device length-scales (10 mm separation
between the rings, and 30 mm jet diameter). Therefore, these
results show that LEM3D is a promising approach to face the above
challenge of the LEM and ODT framework. It remains to be seen how
well it performs in combustion problems, and if its further complex-
ity in comparison with classic LEM coupled with LES (LEM3D has
nine main steps while the splicing has five) indeed produces more
accurate results.

PAs in the case of TPDF, the high computational cost of LEM and
ODT simulations is another challenge when using them for high-
speed-combustion problems. In LEM and ODT, the cost of solving
Eqs. (7.1)(cid:1)(7.11) scales with the number of thermochemical quanti-
ties, Na, times the number of LEM elements needed for a given LES
or RANS cell, Nlem. Therefore, a LEM or ODT simulation is Nlem times
more expensive than an equivalent one with the no-model
approach, which is considered as a benchmark here. With LEM, val-
D 10¡20 have been used [258,267]. Thus, LEM simula-
ues of Nlem
tions are an order of magnitude more expensive than equivalent no-
model-approach simulations. One approach to reduce their

Pcomputational cost is to follow the hybrid-model idea discussed at
the end of Section 5.4. Such an approach could be based on the above
method by Ranjan et al. [139], consisting of dual LEM-no-model sim-
ulations, and enhanced by defining an appropriate approximate
error and a run-time measure of a cost function, as done by Wu et al.
[121] for flamelets. In this way, the cost of LEM could be reduced by
switching to a simulation that is an order of magnitude less costly
whenever and wherever the error of using the latter type of simula-
tion is deemed acceptable. Another approach is based in the fact that
usually the number of species is much larger than the number of
fluid-mechanical quantities. Taking this into account, this approach
would use a dual-mesh: a fine mesh for the fluid-mechanical quanti-
ties, and a coarse mesh for thermochemical quantities. LES or RANS
equations are solved in the fine mesh, and LEM equations (Eqs.
(7.1)(cid:1)(7.12)) are solved by considering a coarse mesh. In this way,
the cost of the LEM simulations is approximately reduced by a factor
equal to the ratio of the number of cells in the coarse and fine
meshes. Thus, although computationally expensive, there are avail-
able approaches to reduce the cost of LEM simulations, one based on
a multi-model approach, another based on a multi-mesh approach.
Furthermore, both approaches can be combined to reduce the cost
even further.

8. Conclusions

P1. Experiments and simulation studies of flow problems that are
simple but representative of the combustion environments of
propulsion systems such as aero-gas-turbine engines, augmen-
tors, ramjets and scramjets indicate that such environments can
have the following features: they have non-premixed and pre-
mixed zones; they span multiple combustion regimes including
distributed-reaction-like combustion; they can have significant
interactions between combustion and strong flow compressions
and expansions; and, the turbulence may have different features
than those typical of nonreacting, low-speed turbulence. These
flow environments are termed here high-speed combustion.
P2. TPDF, LEM and ODT could use the same turbulent-combustion-
model formulation without problem-dependent changes to sim-
ulate the multi-physics and multi-regime nature of high-speed-
combustion problems. Flamelet models are challenged by this
task due to their low-dimensional-manifold assumption, but a
promising methodology to overcome this challenge has been
discussed.

P3. While TPDF, LEM and ODT provide a closure for the average
chemical source term and need to rely on other methods to
compute the instantaneous chemical source term in a computa-
tionally affordable way, flamelet models solve both of these
problems at once because of their low-dimensional-manifold
assumption.

P4. TPDF submodels for the subgrid or fluctuating interaction
between turbulent combustion and flow compressions and
expansions and viscous heating need revision because they
assume that the flow is nonreacting, among other simplifica-
tions. There is no empirical evidence, however, to support this
need. Submodels for micromixing need further study and per-
haps revision due to unexplained discrepancies between TPDF
predictions and measurements of distributed-reaction-like
flames.

P5. LEM and ODT require methods to mitigate artifacts resulting
from coupling a 1D subgrid or fluctuating description of the flow
with the 3D resolved flow because these artifacts could be more
detrimental in high-speed flows than in low-speed flows due to
strong flow compressions and expansions in the former.

P6. The prevalent idea of closing various terms of the averaged con-
servation equations as if the closure of one term can be dealt

Pindependently from the closure of other terms may need revi-
sion if enough empirical evidence is brought to support the
hypothesis that the features of the turbulence in high-speed
combustion are strongly affected by combustion. Some of this
evidence is discussed here, but is scant and not from experi-
ments.

P7. Many high-speed-combustion simulations reviewed in this
paper, using either the no-model approach or the above models,
provide predictions that, although not poor at all locations,
exhibit local discrepancies such as reaction where it is not seen
in experiments, O(100) K deviations, and O(10) % errors in wall
pressure in scramjet-like geometries.

P8. It is not clear that these modeling errors are due to the turbu-
lent-combustion model, nor that they can be reduced by
improving the turbulent-combustion model, because in at least
eleven studies, errors from other models, unknown boundary
conditions, or numerics are likely to be critically important.
Thus, to assess the modeling error due to the turbulent-combus-
tion model, a minimal requirement is to try to isolate it by, say,
keeping all parameters the same except for those of the turbu-
lent-combustion model.

P9. When this is done, several studies discussed here show that
making a turbulent-combustion model more consistent with
the physics at hand improves its accuracy, although not always.
Thus, the above modeling challenges of making the models
more consistent with the physics should not be discarded
because D

Xthey are conceptual.

P10. Furthermore, when the above isolation is done, five reviewed
studies (four LES, one RANS) show that simulations with flame-
lets, TPDF, or LEM provide significantly more accurate predic-
tions than equivalent ones using the no-model approach. In one
of these studies, no-model-approach simulations exhibit com-
bustion where it is not seen in experiments, and in another one
they show reaction zones qualitatively different from those
observed experimentally. In contrast, equivalent simulations
with a turbulent-combustion model do not exhibit these arti-
facts. Furthermore, these two enhancements in accuracy have
been explained to be due to capturing physics that are missed
with the no-model approach. However, one study does not
show a significant improvement of accuracy by using a turbu-
instead of the no-model approach.
lent-combustion model
Therefore, these studies suggest that using a turbulent-combus-
tion model tends to lead to more accurate results in comparison
with the use of the no-model approach, but not always.

P11. To interpret the conclusion from the previous item and its corre-
sponding studies, the reader is left with two points of view. On
one hand, it can be speculated that by using coarser (and more
practically relevant) meshes the above studies would have
shown a larger enhancement of accuracy by using a turbulent-
combustion model. None of these studies documents (with
plots) a mesh-sensitivity analysis. On the other hand, none of
these studies is a blind test in which experimental data other
than the boundary conditions are unknown to the modeler, and
only one of them documents a limited model-constant-sensitiv-
ity analyses. (In fact, of all the reviewed studies the only one
that is partially a blind test uses the no-model approach.) As a
result, the comparisons of the above item could be deemed
unfair because the no-model approach has no model constants.

P12. From an empirical point of view, no conclusions can be made
about the accuracy and computational cost for high-speed-com-
bustion problems of at least two models among flamelets, TPDF,
and LEM and ODT because they have not been compared in this
way. A workD
Xaround to this preferable direct comparison is then
needed. A simple one could be to document the accuracy and
computational cost of one of these models in comparison with a
approach.

PFurthermore, this should be done with at least two levels of
mesh refinement, one of which should be as coarse as those that
would be used in practical devices.

Experiments and high-resolution simulations have provided signifi-
cant insight into high-speed combustion. The picture is certainly
more complex than that of the classic review of Ferri. Furthermore,
simulations with flamelets, TPDF, LEM and ODT demonstrate the
capability of these approaches to capture some of the difficult phys-
ics of this problem. However, their current predictions for high-
speed combustion show discrepancies with experiments that are
hard to overlook. Nonetheless, it is perhaps impractical to demand
from these models the sort of accuracy observed in simpler prob-
lems such as the Sydney-Sandia nonpremixed flames. Hence it is left
to propulsion engineers using these models to decide if the disagree-
ments documented here are acceptable or not to design propulsion
systems. In the opinion of the authors they are not. In such case, it is
reasonable to propose that work should be conducted in addressing
the above modeling challenges by, for example, developing some of
the ideas reviewed here. However, if this path is followed, it is of
utmost importance to fairly assess if these models are actually pro-
viding enhanced predictions over some benchmark.
