Underground coal thermal treatment (UCTT) is a promising concept that was recently proposed for extract-
ing high-value hydrocarbon fuels from deep coal seams, which are economically unattractive for mining.
UCTT is essentially an in situ pyrolysis process that converts underground coals into synthetic liquid and
gaseous fuels, while leaving most of the carbon underground as a char matrix. The produced synthetic fuels
have higher H/C ratios than coals. The remaining char matrix is an ideal reservoir for CO2 sequestration
because pyrolysis significantly increases the surface area of the char. The UCTT concept is relatively new,
and there is little research in this area. However, underground oil shale retorting, which is also an in-situ
hydrocarbon fuels conversion process, shares key features with UCTT and has gained momentum in demon-
stration and commercial development. As such, there is a large body of literature available in this area. A
review of the studies on underground oil shale retorting that are closely related to UCTT will shed light on
the UCTT process. This paper presents a review of the recent literature on underground oil shale retorting
that are most relevant to UCTT process. The review provides a background to the reader by comparing the
properties of coal with oil shale, with an emphasis on the feasibility of applying oil shale retorting techni-
ques to UCTT process. The review further discusses the coal and oil shale conversion issues and uses the
knowledge of the latter as guidance for the development of UCTT. Published data on pyrolysis of large coal
blocks at conditions relevant to UCTT process is scarce. Therefore, literature on conventional coal pyrolysis
is reviewed for optimization of the UCTT process. Despite the abundant studies on pulverized coal pyrolysis,
there are still many open questions on whether they can be directly applied to UCTT. A comparison of the
unique environment of UCTT with conditions of conventional pulverized coal pyrolysis clearly shows there
are knowledge gaps. Future research needs are then proposed to close these gaps.

1. Introduction

PCoal is the most abundant fossil fuel on the earth, comprising
over 50% of the world's total resources of fossil fuels [1]. It is the sec-
ond largest part (about 30%) of the world's energy supply and main-
tains the largest share (about 43% in 2014) of the electricity
generation in the world [1]. Coal will continue to be a major energy
resource in the foreseeable future, particularly in some developing
countries such as China and India, where natural gas is not abundant.
Most of the coal resources, however, are economically unminable
because these coals are buried too deep [2]. For example, China has
60% of coal located more than 1000 meters below the surface [3].
Estimates also suggest that tapping deeply buried coals could help

recoverable coal

Pincrease the U.S.
reserves by as much as
300%(cid:1)400% [4,5]. On the other hand, coal has a bad image because
of the high pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions associated with
its combustion. According to International Energy Agency [6], coal
accounted for 46% of the global CO2 emissions in 2014, the largest
contributor among fossil fuels due to its heavy carbon content per
unit of heating value, although it only represented 29% of the world's
total primary energy share. Consequently, new methods are needed
to extract and utilize these deeply buried coals more economically
and cleanly.

PUnderground coal thermal treatment (UCTT) is a recently pro-
posed concept that offers the prospect of converting deeply buried
coals into high-value hydrocarbon fuels that have less CO2 emissions

Pper energy content. In this process, the coal seam is heated by exter-
nal energy and decomposition products are recovered in the form of
gaseous and liquid fuels. Much of the carbon remains underground
and forms a carbon matrix. As such, UCTT is an in situ method that
can extract hydrocarbon fuels from coal seams that are otherwise
economically unattractive through traditional mining methods. The
concept of UCTT is schematically shown in Fig. 1.

PUCTT is essentially an in situ pyrolysis process in a non-oxidizing
environment, which distinguishes itself from underground coal gasi-
fication (UCG). The non-oxidizing environment offers UCTT signifi-
cant environmental advantages over UCG [7-9]. UCTT does not have
the risk of uncontrolled fire spread underground, a major concern in
UCG [10,11]. With pyrolysis taking place at much lower tempera-
tures (usually below 600 °C) than gasification, UCTT is expected to
have much lower sulfur emissions. The inorganic sulfur, which is the
dominant source of coal sulfur emissions, is unlikely to release from
the coal at temperatures below 900 °C [12,13]. UCTT significantly
reduces the risk of underground water contamination compared
with UCG. The mineral matter in coal is unlikely to decompose at the
low pyrolysis temperatures and will remain in the carbon matrix
formed after pyrolysis. The carbon matrix can be envisioned as a
huge molecular sieve that traps almost all contaminants. In contrast,
UCG leaves little carbon in oxidized zones and releases some aro-
matic species to surrounding aquifers [11,14]. The carbon matrix left
by UCTT also is less likely to collapse than the ashes left by UCG. The
collapse of ashes may result in surface subsidence, which is a major
risk in UCG [10,11]. In addition, the remaining carbon matrix has a
significantly increased internal surface area and offers a great poten-
tial for CO2 storage. The carbon emissions from UCTT process itself
plus that from burning the produced fuels could be balanced by uti-
lizing the carbon matrix as a CO2 reservoir, i.e., the process could be
“carbon neutral”.

PUCTT also produces fuels with higher H/C ratio than UCG. Coal
pyrolysis tends to favor hydrogen removal than carbon removal,
compared with gasification [15]. Pollutant and CO2 emissions from
burning these higher H/C ratio fuels will be much less than burning

Pcoals. In summary, UCTT is an attractive concept for underground in
situ fuel extraction in a more environmentally benign way.
It
deserves further investigation to evaluate its economics and techno-
logical issues, and to identify future research needs. This concept,
however, is relatively new, and little literature is available for review
and assessment. Current reviews relevant to UCTT are summarized
in Table 1. Despite the large body of reviews on UCG and conven-
tional coal pyrolysis, to date no reviews address the specific features
of UCTT, i.e., in situ pyrolysis in a non-oxidizing underground (spa-
tially confined) environment. Fortunately, UCTT largely resembles
underground oil shale retorting in that the underground resources
are thermally treated. Only the target resource differs - coal versus
oil shale. In the last decade, underground oil shale retorting has
been pilot-tested and is gaining momentum towards commercializa-
tion. The breakthrough in underground oil shale retorting technolo-
gies will likely provide guidance to a UCTT process, although it must
be tailored to the specific properties of coal. In addition, coal pyroly-
sis has been well studied for conventional applications (pulverized
coal combustion, gasification, coking, et al.). Leveraging the readily
available literature on underground oil shale retorting and conven-
tional pulverized coal pyrolysis, one can preliminarily evaluate the
feasibility, economics, technological and environmental issues of
UCTT.

PIn light of the great potential to address UCTT issues using oil
shale retorting technologies, we present this review. In Section 2, a
comparison on the most relevant properties of coal and oil shale is
made to show the feasibility of UCTT. In Section 3, recent develop-
ment of underground oil shale retorting technologies is reviewed in
the context of tailoring them to UCTT. The review is focused on the
conversion issues of coal and oil shale, leveraging the knowledge of
the latter as guidance for the development of UCTT. In Section 4,
studies on coal pyrolysis that are closely related to UCTT are
reviewed for identifying the key operating parameters. In Section 5,
recommendations are given to optimize the product yield and com-
position of UCTT by adjusting the operating parameters. In Section 6,
economics of UCTT are discussed at system level. In Section 7,

Ptechnical challenges and environmental issues in operation of UCTT
are discussed. In Section 8, the review reveals that there is a big gap
when applying the knowledge of conventional coal pyrolysis to
UCTT, by comparing the unique environment of UCTT with the con-
ditions of conventional coal pyrolysis. Future research perspectives
to address the gap are then proposed. The ultimate objective of the
review is to spur more discussions and research activities on UCTT
by initializing a framework, rather than giving definitive answers to
specific problems.

2. Physical, chemical and geological properties

PBy comparing the properties of coal and oil shale, one can roughly
assess the feasibility and economics of applying underground oil
shale retorting technology to UCTT. The most relevant properties are
rank, formation depth and thickness, permeability, and heat capac-
ity. Coal rank impacts product yield and composition. Formation
depth and thickness impacts the economics. Permeability largely
determines mass transfer, i.e., collection of synthetic fuels from
underground. Heat capacity impacts heating cost and temperature
history in the pyrolysis process, which in turn affects product yield
and composition.

2.1. Rank and elemental composition

PCoal rank and elemental composition are determined by proxi-
mate and ultimate analyses, respectively. For comparison, proximate
and ultimate analyses of representative coal and oil shales are listed
in Table 2 [32] and Table 3, by the rank from high to low. Here we
focus on the most relevant properties concerning UCTT: volatile
matter (VM), moisture, oxygen, and hydrogen contents. For a
detailed description of coal ranks and classification, the readers are
referred to Speight [33] and ASTM standard D388 [34].

P2.1.1. Volatile matter

PVolatile matter content is the most important factor determining
the yield of fuels that can be potentially extracted from coal, because
the gas and liquid fuels are converted from the volatile matter dur-
ing coal pyrolysis. Indeed, pyrolysis is usually not distinguished from
devolatilization when performed in an inert environment [40].
Table 2 shows that high-volatile bituminous coals, as indicated by
the name, contain the highest fraction of volatile matter (>33%).
Medium and low-volatile bituminous coals, subbituminous coals
and lignite, also contain a good amount of volatile matter (26(cid:1)34%).
Anthracite coals contain only 5(cid:1)10%. Table 3 shows that most oil
shales have 20(cid:1)40% volatile matter by weight, which is comparable
to coals (except anthracite). The rich oil shales contain more than
30% volatile matter, similar to the high-volatile bituminous coals.
This comparison, in first principle, indicates that the potential yield

Pof UCTT is comparable to that of underground oil shale retorting. In
turn, the UCTT concept is viable in terms of product yield. Bitumi-
nous coals, especially the high-volatile bituminous coals are most
suited for UCTT considering maximum product yield. In addition,
bituminous coals will consume less heat during UCTT compared to
other lower rank coals, because bituminous coals contain less mois-
ture than the low-rank coals. A significant amount of heat will be
wasted in water vaporization and desorption.

P2.1.2. Water

PMoisture in coal is a significant energy barrier to UCTT, because it
takes a significant amount of heat to vaporize the water. The heat
capacity of liquid water is 3-4 times of dry coal [41] and 4 times of
dry oil shale [42,43]. Moisture can also participate in pyrolysis reac-
tions and affect the final pyrolysis products [44,45]. Therefore, mois-
ture content is a critical property to be considered in the process
design and economic analysis. However, if UCTT is performed on a
coal-bed methane (CBM) production site, the moisture would have
already been removed, which is a substantial energy saving.

PMoisture content in coal decreases with coal rank. Lignite usually
contains highest water content, while anthracite has the lowest
water content. Moisture content in lignite is in the range of
20%(cid:1)40% of the total weight, and is often over 30% [46]. In pyrolysis,
about 50% of energy input is consumed to heat the water in a 20%
moisture content coal, a significant energy penalty. Moisture in sub-
bituminous coals ranges from 15(cid:1)30% [46]. The moisture content is
usually below 10% for bituminous coals except for high-volatile C
[46,47]. In comparison, moisture content of oil shales except for the
Fushun, Maoming and Huadian oil shales, is mostly in the range of
5(cid:1)10%. This value is generally comparable to that of high-volatile B
and C bituminous coals, and higher than that of other bituminous
coals. From energy cost perspective, coals that have ranks higher
than subbituminous-A are recommended for UCTT.

P2.1.3. Elemental composition

PCoal elemental composition is also a concern for the feasibility of
UCTT. The oxygen and hydrogen content significantly affects the
quality of the fuels produced from underground thermal treatment.
Oxygen content correlates closely with CO and CO2 emissions [48],
which are subject to environmental regulations. Low oxygen content
is preferred and is usually found in bituminous and anthracite coals.
Lignite and sub-bituminous coals contain a higher percentage of
oxygen at about 15(cid:1)34% (Table 2), compared to 2(cid:1)13% for bitumi-
nous coals and about 2(cid:1)3% for anthracite coals. High hydrogen con-
tent, however, is desirable because it is essential for producing
premium, high H/C ratio fuels. Liquids obtained from coal conversion
process are often characterized by API gravity [49]. Premium light
crude oils have greater API gravity by definition. A coal liquid with
high hydrogen content has a larger API value and requires less

Pupgrading work. High hydrogen content also results in less CO2
emissions in the utilization of the fuel. The coal hydrogen content is
inversely related to its rank, i.e., a high rank coal has low hydrogen
content. This is because the hydrogen element leaves coal during the
coalification process. The hydrogen content in anthracite coals is
between 2 and 4%, compared to 5%(cid:1)6% for bituminous coals, and
4(cid:1)6% for sub-bituminous and lignite coals.

PSimilar to coal, high oxygen content exists in lean shale samples
that also feature low carbon content (Table 3). In general, rich oil
shales have oxygen content comparable to high-volatile A and
higher-rank bituminous coals. Hydrogen content in shale samples
increases with heating value from 1(cid:1)2% for lean shales to about
5(cid:1)6% for rich shales. Hydrogen content in most coals excluding
some anthracites is about 5(cid:1)7%, comparable to that of rich shales.
Rich oil shales, however, have a slightly higher H/C ratio than most
of the coals. H/C ratio is a key factor in determining the API gravity.
Therefore, it can be inferred that the product quality of UCTT will at
the best approach that of underground oil shale retorting.

P2.1.4. Implications for UCTT

PAnalyses of volatile matter and moisture content suggest that
comparable yield can be obtained from underground thermal treat-
ment of high-volatile bituminous coals and rich oil shales. Analyses
of oxygen and hydrogen content suggest that high-quality pyrolysis
products (e.g., high API gravity oil) can also be obtained from bitumi-
nous coals. More unwanted byproducts, such as CO and CO2 are
emitted from lower rank coals such as subbituminous coals and lig-
nites. The energy cost for bituminous coal underground thermal
treatment is also expected to be less than that for underground oil
shale conversion considering the lower water in coal, although the
exact number depends on the specific heat of coal and oil shale.
Therefore, bituminous coals, especially high-volatile bituminous
coals, are the targets for early-stage UCTT demonstration. The fuel
quality of UCTT, however, will tend to be lower than that of oil shale
because of the lower H/C ratio in coal.

2.2. Formation depth and thickness

P2.2.1. Coal formation

PThe depth of coal seam is an important factor in determining if
mining or in situ thermal treatment should be used [50]. Currently
900(cid:1)1200 m is the maximum depth for mining for coal to be consid-
ered as a reserve, whereas between 1200(cid:1)1800 m it is subeconomic
for mining and the coal is considered as resource only [50]. At such a
subeconomic formation depth, underground thermal treatment is a
promising alternative to extract the energy from coal in the form of
pyrolysis gases and liquids. Using UCTT, the deeply buried coals will
become economically available, and this greatly expands the recov-
erable coal reserves. For example, 60% of the Chinese coal is buried

Pmore than 1000 m below the surface [3]. Estimates also suggest that
tapping deeply buried coals could increase the U.S. recoverable coal
reserves by as much as 300%(cid:1)400% [4].

PThe thickness of the coal seam also significantly impacts the eco-
nomics and technology of UCTT. A thin coal layer tends to waste
energy by losing heat to the surrounding rock layers. Moreover, a
thin coal layer increases infrastructure cost because more heat pipes
are needed per unit volume. This economic consideration is similar
as in coal mining when the formation is too thin or the formation
thickness/depth ratio is too small, it becomes economically unattrac-
tive. The minimum thickness for a coal layer to be counted in as
resources is 0.37 m for anthracite and bituminous coals, and this
number increases for the coal to be classified as reserves [51]. There-
fore, thick coal layer is preferred for UCTT to avoid wasting heat and
save infrastructure investment. The thickness of a majority of coal
seams is usually within 30 m, while the thickest can reach hundred
meters. A record coal seam thickness was reported in Shaer Lake
(Schallsee) field in Hami Basin, China [52] to be 217 m. In the U.S.,
the thickest single coal layer is estimated to be 75 m. It is located in
the Wasatch Formation on the western edge of the Powder River
Basin. However, most of the coal formation is buried deep and not
economically minable. A UCTT approach might be able to extract
these resources in an economical and environmental-friendly way.

P2.2.2. Oil shale formation

POil shale deposits in the western United States are located at
shallower depths than those deeply buried coals. The overburden
layer in the Green River Formation can be up to 300 m, and the
ratio between the overburden and oil shale formation thickness
is around 1:2 [53], indicating that in some locations, one may
find shale deposits of 600 m thick. In Daqing, China, the overbur-
den of oil shale deposit is 30(cid:1)90 m, and the average thickness of
the deposit is only 6 m [54]. The cost for drilling wells and laying
the heat pipes into deeply buried coals is expected to be higher
than that for oil shales.

P2.2.3. Implications for UCTT

PCandidates for UCTT are the deeply buried coals (e.g., more
than 1000 m below the surface), with a minimum thickness that
is economically feasible. The greater depth of coal seams will
increase infrastructure investment, compared with oil shales.
The greater depth, however, also favors methane production and
CO2 sequestration because of the increased hydrostatic pressure
[55]. It might not be economically feasible to apply UCTT to thin
coal seams separated by rock layers.
In comparison, shale is
more uniformly distributed in the rock without separating into
different layers. Thick layers parallel to the surface such as the
Big George Deposit in the Powder River Basin [56] are candidates
for UCTT. A benefit of such a deposit is that it has been tapped
for CBM and has been dewatered.

2.3. Permeability

PPermeability is critical for mass transfer. Sufficient permeability
is required for the produced liquids and gases to transport out of the
coal or shale. There is a huge difference in permeability between
coal and oil shale formations. The permeability of raw oil shale is
very low because oil shale is largely an inorganic rock formation,
and the pores of the rock are filled with nondisplaceable organic
material [57,58]. Rubblization is usually needed for efficient opera-
tion of underground oil shale retorting due to the low permeability
and porosity in oil shale. Thanks to the low content of inorganic mat-
ter and massive internal pore structures, coal usually has much
higher permeability than oil shale.

PCoal can be considered as a dual porosity/permeability system
that consists of porous matrix and cleats, as shown in Fig. 2 [59,60].

Fig. 2. Illustration of the coal porous/fracture system: matrix pores and cleats.
Reprinted from [59] with permission of Elsevier.

PMass transport in coal occurs at two scales: diffusion through the
pores of the coal matrix, and flow through the macroscopic cleats,
the natural fracture system of coal [61(cid:1)63]. Both pore diffusion and
fracture convection contribute to the permeability of coal. Once dif-
fusing out of the matrix pores, gases and liquids form streams in the
cleats. The naturally occurring pores and cleats can change signifi-
cantly in the pyrolysis process. Correspondingly, permeability of a
coal seam can be classified as two categories: naturally occurring
permeability and pyrolysis-induced permeability.

PResearch on the natural permeability of coal started in 1980s
for the production of CBM [64]. The topic is being revisited due
to the recent interest in enhanced CBM production and using
coal seams as CO2 sequestration sites [65(cid:1)67]. Extensive studies
have been performed to identify key factors that influence coal
permeability. For a complete summary of these studies, the
reader is referred to McKee [64] and Pan and Connell [68]. A
general consensus is that coal permeability strongly depends on
the stress and strain from the overburden and matrix swelling/
shrinking, especially when gas adsorption/desorption occurs
[69(cid:1)76]. For deeply buried coal seams, the stress from the over-
burden tends to close the cleats, thus reducing its permeability.
Studies have shown that coal permeability decreases by 1-2
orders of magnitude when effective stress is increased by 14 MPa
[64]. On the other hand, gas desorption increases permeability
by opening the pores, and causing coal matrix to shrink and
cleats to expand. For example, well tests conducted at three
wells in the Valencia Canyon area of the San Juan Basin (subbitu-
minous to bituminous coals) found that permeability, during
CBM production process, increased 2.7(cid:1)7.1 times [71].

PPyrolysis-induced permeability of coal

increases drastically
upon heating, due to the release of moisture, volatiles and
increase of porosity [77(cid:1)85]. When the devolatilization com-
pletes, the permeability of the coal can increase by more than
1000 times for subbituminous and bituminous coals [77(cid:1)81] and
more than 100 times for lignite coals [82]. In fact, rubblization
was deemed unnecessary in Shell's UCTT patent [80,81], because
high permeability and porosity in coal seams will develop during
devolatilization. Studies on the effects of pyrolysis on coal per-
meability mostly target UCG applications. For a detailed review
of the studies, the reader is referred to Akbarzadeh and Chalatur-
nyk [21]. In general, permeability is less of a concern in UCTT
than that in underground oil shale retorting, primarily because
of the low ash content of coal and the remarkable porosity
growth in coal pyrolysis.

2.4. Heat capacity

P2.4.2. Density

H.R. Zhang et al. / Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 62 (2017) 1(cid:1)32

7

PFor both oil shale and coal, density generally increases monotoni-
cally with depth because of the dense packing at the increased litho-
static and hydrostatic pressures from overburden and surrounding
reservoir. The density of oil shale varies depending on the formation,
and is generally in the range of 1.5(cid:1)2.5 g/cm3, as shown in Fig. 4
[94]. The lower the shale's kerogen content, the higher the shale's
density. The Maoming oil shale deposit in China has a bulk density
of about 1.85 g/cm3 [95]. In comparison, coal density is usually lower
than its surrounding sediments, and is in the range of 1.1(cid:1)1.8 g/cm3,
depending on the rank [96]. A general rule is that the density of
coal increases with its rank because the lighter element content
decreases as coal matures.

PCombining the specific heat and density, the specific heat of coal
per volume basis is in the range of 2(cid:1)5.4 J/(cm3 (cid:3) K), while for oil
shale it is 1.5(cid:1)2.5 J/(cm3 (cid:3) K). Therefore, coal will likely need more
heat per unit volume compared to oil shale, to reach the same tem-
perature increase. For conductive heating, this translates into more
heat piping per unit volume or higher temperature of heating source,
which will increase the infrastructure and energy cost of the heating
system.

2.5. Implications for UCTT

PCoal and oil shale properties that are most relevant to under-
ground thermal treatment were compared, and the results suggest
that UCTT is economically and technically feasible. The best suited
candidate for UCTT will be a high-volatile bituminous coal that is
deeply buried and has a reasonable coal seam thickness. Ideally the

temperature, Heat transfer into a unit volume scales with the prod-
uct of specific heat capacity and density. Consequently, specific heat
capacity and density are critical properties to be considered when
heating oil shales and coals for hydrocarbon fuels.

ð1Þ

P2.4.1. Specific heat capacity

PGilliam and Morgan [87] reported that the specific heat of Devo-
nian shale, Pierre shale, and oil shale from the Green River formation
is in the range of 1000(cid:1)1500 J/(kg (cid:3) K). Berkovich et al. [88] reported
that for the kerogen and clay minerals in some Australian oil shales,
the values are in the range of 1820(cid:1)2500 and 690(cid:1)1020 J/(kg (cid:3) K) ,
respectively, at temperatures below 400 °C. Because kerogen is the
minor component of the oil shale, it can be estimated that the spe-
cific heat of these Australian oil shales barely exceeds 1500 J/(kg (cid:3) K)
Model developed by Palmer et al. [89] predicts the specific heat of
oil shale is generally in the range of 1000(cid:1)1500 J/(kg (cid:3) K) depending
on the fraction of kerogen.

PIn comparison, the specific heat of coal

is in the range of
1000(cid:1)3000 J/(kg (cid:3) K) , depending on the composition and tempera-
ture [90(cid:1)92]. Merrick [93] proposed a model for calculating coal
specific heat for coke-making applications, which predicts coal spe-
cific heat increases with temperature. The specific heat of coal is
generally above 2000 J/(kg (cid:3) K) at typical pyrolysis temperatures, as
shown in Fig. 3 [90]. The two peaks occur at about 100 and 400 °C,
corresponding to water vaporization and devolatilization chemical
reactions, respectively. Higher specific heat of coal indicates more
heat input than oil shale for heating the same amount of mass to
achieve the same temperature increase.

Pcoal seam has already undergone CBM production. The pyrolysis
product yield is comparable or even higher than the rich oil shale
due to the higher volatile content of coal. The quality of liquid fuel is
likely lower than that of oil shale because of the lower H/C ratio in
coal. The infrastructure investment and energy cost of UCTT, how-
ever, can be higher than that of oil shale for the same operation tem-
perature, due to the higher heat capacity of coal. To improve product
quality and minimize production cost, the oil shale retorting tech-
nology needs to be tailored to the unique characteristics of UCTT.
Therefore, potential technologies and coal pyrolysis are reviewed
and discussed to provide a background for optimization of the UCTT
process.

3. Potential technologies

PUnlike underground coal gasification, there is very little literature
on UCTT. However, a large number of underground retorting tech-
nologies relevant to UCTT have been explored for in situ fuels pro-
duction from oil shale [42,53,97(cid:1)103]. In addition, progress in
supporting technologies such as directional drilling and hydraulic
fracturing has enabled commercial success of underground shale oil
and shale gas exploration. These existing shale conversion technolo-
gies provide a starting point for developing an underground coal
thermal treatment approach. In the following, we will provide an
overview and discussion on the technologies relevant to UCTT.

3.1. Underground retorting technologies

PThe shale conversion concepts can be divided into four major cat-
egories according to the heating techniques: internal combustion,
wall conduction, externally generated hot gas, and volumetric heat-
ing. Combined technologies of these four categories were also
explored by industrial companies. An overview of these approaches
is presented in Table 4. Comparison of the product quality and
energy balance, advantages and drawbacks are summarized in
Tables 5 and 6, respectively.

P3.1.1. Internal combustion

PThe internal combustion approaches feature the combustion of
oil shale to generate a fire front moving through the oil shale deposit.
The heat of the fire front breaks down macromolecular hydrocarbon
clusters of the oil shale into oils and gases. In 1972, Occidental Petro-
leum became the first company in the U.S. to conduct a viability

Overview of various underground oil shale conversion approaches.

Pstudy of a modified in situ process using the internal combustion
approach at Logan Wash, Colorado [101,104(cid:1)107]. Since then, sev-
eral companies have tested the internal combustion approaches,
including the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)
[108(cid:1)110], and Geokinetics Horizontal [111]. The internal combus-
tion approach requires rubblization of an oil shale formation to cre-
ate porosity that facilitates the flow of gas and oil toward the
extraction wells before the combustion starts. A fraction of the
shale deposit needs to be removed to allow oil shale expansion
during the rubblization. In the LLNL RISE demonstration, 20% of an
oil shale deposit was mined for this purpose. Explosives were often
used for rubblization.

PInternal combustion method is not recommended for UCTT as the
CO2 produced during combustion can cause gasification reactions.
Indeed, internal combustion has been tested in UCG. There are sig-
nificant efforts ongoing on UCG which, are beyond the scope of the
present review. For the current status of UCG development, the
reader is referred to Bhutto et al. [2], and Shafirovich and Varma
[14].

P3.1.2. Wall conduction

PWall conduction in situ technologies use heating elements or
heating pipes inside the oil shale to thermally decompose the kero-
gen. Wall conduction technologies have been explored by several
companies for oil shale conversion, including the Shell in situ conver-
sion process (Shell ICP) in 1997 at Piceance Creek Basin, Colorado
[112(cid:1)114], and the Conduction, Convection, Reflux (CCR) Process by
American Shale Oil (formerly E. G. L. Resources) at Western Colorado
[115]. The Shell ICP uses electrical heating elements to heat the shale
to 340-370°C for a very long time [107,116]. The production volume
is isolated by a freeze wall (Fig. 5) filled with super-chilled fluid to
protect the surrounding water [53,116,117]. Drawbacks of this pro-
cess are the high consumption of electricity and water, and potential
contamination of ground water [107]. The American Shale Oil CCR
process heats the shale using heating pipes in which superheated
steam or other heat carrier keeps circulating [101,115]. In the CCR
process, both vertical and horizontal wells are used to promote heat
transfer and facilitate product collection. A coal seam usually con-
sists of many single coal layers with rock layers in between. There-
fore, when a heating and extraction piping system is designed, the
pipe orientation should consider the structure of the coal seam. To
avoid wasting energy in the rock layers, pipes parallel to the coal
layer make the most sense.

ture for 10 min. Higher pressure, lower temperature, and slower heating leads to lower oil yield and higher gas yield. Synthetic crude has a high H:C ratio of 1.9:1.

PThe wall conduction technique has later been adapted to coal.
Underground coal thermal treatment using wall conduction heating
was proposed by Shell Oil Company [80,81]. In their process, the
coal was heated to 525 °C and gas and oil of very high quality were
produced. The major products include a coal liquid with API gravity
over 30. According to API manual [49], light crude oil has an API
gravity of higher than 31.1 (less than 870 kg/m3), and medium crude
oil has an API gravity between 22.3 and 31.1 (870 to 920 kg/m3).
Therefore, the Shell ICP produces medium oil towards the lighter
end, which can be considered high quality oil. In this process, steam
is supplied by combusting fuels. Since direct heat exchange has a
higher efficiency than electricity generation, the CCR process saves
energy compared to the Shell ICP.

PBoth the electrical heating and steam heating methods can easily
change the operation temperature. The two processes can be easily
tuned to the optimized heating temperature for coal pyrolysis. In
addition, wall conduction using hot pipes leads to very uniform ther-
mal heating, which leads to a uniform distribution of porosity and a
higher permeability. Therefore, wall conduction using heating ele-
ments or heating pipes are promising candidates for UCTT.

P3.1.3. Geothermic Fuel Cell

PAn interesting heating approach was proposed by Independent
Energy Partners [118] by placing a “Geothermic Fuel Cell” stack
within a formation to heat the oil shale. As the formation is heated,
oils and gases are released and collected, which are then partially
transferred to the fuel cell to generate the heat for shale pyrolysis as
well as electricity. External oxidants are supplied to the fuel cell in
the meantime. The advantage of this technology is that the fuel cell
is self-sustained by the pyrolysis gases, once it is started by natural
gas. This technology also has high efficiency and low carbon emis-
sions because the waste heat of fuel cell (when converting chemical
energy of the fuel into electricity) is used to heat the shale formation.
Fuel cell technology, however, is less mature compared to electrical
heating or steam heating [119]. Control of the oxidation rate and
reaction temperature is still an issue. Fuel cell operation is also very
sensitive to the fuel gas composition. Tiny amounts of sulfur gas or
other impurities may cause serious problems to the fuel cell. The
complex composition of pyrolysis gas poses a challenge to the fuel
cell. The operation temperature is relatively fixed for a given type of
fuel cell technology, which may not be flexibly adjusted to achieve

Pas the hot gases flush the coal formation in the horizontal direction,
they tend to go upward and bypass the bottom part of the coal for-
mation, leaving the large part of coal untreated. To overcome this
problem, horizontal wells need to be drilled to facilitate the hot
gases flushing the entire coal formation. Vertical wells are also
needed to inject hot gases at different horizontal locations of the
coal formation.

PCalderon and Laubis [122] proposed an approach of underground
coal pyrolysis using a heated hydrogen-rich recycle gas to extract
syncrude and syngas, and subsequently to convert in situ CO2 to CO,
SO2 to S, NOx to N2 using the residual coal char with a gas stream
consisting of CO2 and air. The hydrogen-rich gas has an advantage of
high specific heat. H2 leakage, however, can be a potential issue
especially under pressurized, heated conditions. The H2, due to its
low density and high diffusivity, has a high tendency to go through
the upper layer of the coal seam and leave the rest of the coal seam
untreated.

PIn general, technologies using externally heat gas save the heat-
ing pipe system compared to wall conduction heating. However,
they have a drawback of incomplete and nonuniform treatment of
the coal formation, due to the propensity of hot gases to go upward.
To overcome this problem, extensive horizontal and vertical wells
are needed to facilitate uniform flush of the coal formation, which
adds the infrastructure cost of the process. In addition, gas heating is
not as good as wall conduction heating in terms of permeability
development of the coal. When a coal formation is heated by the
combustion gases, channeling is usually observed which leads to a
non-uniform porosity distribution [80,81].

P3.1.5. Volumetric heating

PResearchers have also explored the possibilities of using radio
frequency wave and microwave to heat oil shales [123]. In late
1970s, the Illinois Institute of Technology developed an in situ oil
shale radio wave heating technique, which was further developed
by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [124,125]. In the radio
frequency wave method, oil shale is heated by radio waves emitted
from electrodes that are installed underground. Raytheon and CF

approach in conjunction with critical fluid flushing, which was
acquired and patented by Schlumberger [126]. Global Resource Cor-
poration tested a similar concept using microwave heating
[125,117]. Radio wave and microwave deliver heat quickly and uni-
formly, but have the drawbacks of excessive electricity consumption
and wave energy being adsorbed by water and residual chars. Reali-
zation of radio wave and microwave at high pressure conditions,
which are typical of UCTT, demands high electric power.

P3.1.6. ExxonMobil electrofrac

PExxonMobil developed a combined approach of wall conduction
and volumetric heating by injecting an electrically conductive mate-
rial such as calcined petroleum coke into the fractures of an oil shale
formation [127]. This conductive material then forms the heating
element of the electrically heated underground oil shale retort. This
process increases permeability by fracturing and has high thermal
efficiency of planar heating, whereas has a drawback of high electric-
ity consumption.

3.2. Enabling technologies

PTwo important technologies, directional drilling and hydraulic
fracturing, have enabled the recent commercial success of uncon-
ventional oil and gas production, particularly in shale gas prolifera-
tion. The two technologies, having been employed in underground
shale oil production, can be applied to UCTT process.

Pthe optimal heating temperature for coal pyrolysis. Therefore, the
Geothermic Fuel Cell concept still needs development before it can
be applied to UCTT.

PThe “Geothermic fuel cell” concept can be further combined with
in situ carbon capture. This forms the concept of electricity produc-
tion with in situ carbon capture (EPICC). Mulchandani and Brandt
[102] estimate that the life cycle GHG emissions from EPICC amount
to only 50% from those conventional fuel cycles and 33% from other
in situ oil shale conversion processes. A key for low-carbon operation
of the EPICC process is to maintain the shale temperature below the
value that significant decomposition of carbonate minerals occurs.
The optimum operation temperature of fuel cell for electricity gener-
ation may not overlap with this value, which will impair the process
efficiency.

PGiven the fast pace of fuel cell technology development, Geother-
mic Fuel Cell and EPICC type concepts may be attractive for UCTT,
considering their great potential in reducing GHG emissions.

P3.1.4. Externally generated hot gas

PExternally generated hot gas technologies, by the name, use hot
gases that are generated on the ground and then injected under-
ground to heat the oil shale. The gases can be CO2, air, or combustion
exhaust. In 2006, Chevron developed an underground retorting tech-
nique, the Chevron Recovery and Upgrading oil from Shale (CRUSH)
process that circulates heated CO2 through the shale formation
[117,120]. Externally generated hot gases used by other companies
for in situ shale oil production include superheated pressurized air
and shale gas by General Synfuels International's Omnishale tech-
nology [117], and the combustion exhaust of natural gas by Moun-
tain West Energy's in situ Vapor Extraction [121] and alkane gases by
Taiyuan University of Science and Technology (TUST) [78]. The hot
gases in general have a disadvantage of low specific heat compared
to steam. It can be postulated that more piping is needed per unit
volume of coal seam than that for steam heating. Heating the CO2 or
the gases needs expensive gas heat exchanger. In addition, the hot
CO2 and O2 can react with coal via gasification reactions. The hot
gases also have a relatively low density and low viscosity. Therefore,

P3.2.1. Directional drilling

PDirectional drilling is a technique that the well bore can be devi-
ated from the initial perpendicular angle to the surface [128]. It
allows drilling horizontal wells through or under the shale forma-
tion. It also allows multiple horizontal wells from the same vertical
well bore. The horizontal wells enable heating pipes to be installed
horizontally through or under the formation, greatly expanding the
heat transfer surface. The horizontal wells also provide channels for
oil and gas moving into vertical wells, significantly improving the
collection efficiency. Modern directional drilling technology can
even drill along the inclination angle of coal seams. Directional dril-
ling in UCTT process will be broadly used for heating element or
heating pipe installation, heating fluid injection and product collec-
tion.

PIndeed, directional drilling has already been widely used in CBM
production. Horizontal wells are drilled connecting vertical ones to
facilitate methane collection. Substantial studies have been devoted
to the mechanical stability and quality control of both vertical and
horizontal wellbores [129(cid:1)135]. These studies advanced the under-
standing of instability encountered in directional drilling in coal
seams and proposed methods to improve quality control, which can
be readily used by UCTT applications.

P3.2.2. Hydraulic fracturing

PHydraulic fracturing is a recently matured technique that has
been applied in the “unconventional fuel” production, such as shale
gas, tight gas, tight fuel and CBM [136]. As of 2012, 2.5 million "frac-
turing jobs" had been performed worldwide on oil and gas wells,
over one million of which are within the United States [137]. To cre-
ate fractures, a fracturing fluid (often water with additives) is
pumped down to the wellbore to generate pressure to break the for-
mation rock. The fracturing increases permeability of the formation,
thus allows more flow of hydrocarbon to achieve a higher produc-
tion. Water, often mixed with sand, gels, foams and other chemicals,
is commonly used as a fracturing fluid. Conventional approaches
used small volumes of fracturing fluid until the invention of high-
volume horizontal slick-water fracturing in 1990s. The fracturing
fluid in the new technology contains a lower amount of gelling
agents, but adds friction reducers. To maintain the opening after
fracturing, a proppant is usually introduced after the injection. For
understanding the detailed physical mechanisms that control the
efficiency and environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing, the
reader is referred to Hyman et al. [138].

PHydraulic fracturing has been widely used in underground shale
processing such as in ExxonMobil's Electrofrac [127] and TUST's Hot
Alkane Convection [78] technologies. The temperature and pressure
at which a shale rock formation fractures depend on the rock proper-
ties. For example, the Liushuhe oil shale sample fractures under
pressures of 4.5(cid:1)13 atm, in comparison with 80 atm for the Fushun
samples [54].

PObviously hydraulic fracturing adds water into the coal forma-
tion. The added water will likely cause energy penalty when heating
the coal formation. Therefore, care should be exercised in the appli-
cation of hydraulic fraction in UCTT. Unless necessary to increase the
coal permeability, hydraulic fracturing is not recommended.

P3.2.3. Rubblization

PRubblization breaks a rock formation into small pieces or par-
ticles and creates voids, thereby increasing the permeability to pro-
mote mass and heat transfer. In underground oil shale retorting,
rubblization is often required because of the low permeability of oil
shale. Rubblization can be made by explosives or shock waves. For
example, explosives were used to create a rubblized shale formation
in Occidental Petroleum's modified in situ oil shale processing [106].
OP's underground retorts, with a dimension of 50 m wide £ 50 m
deep £ 85 m high, were constructed by mining 3 retort void volumes

P(upper, intermediate, and lower) to provide the expansion space for
the shale formation after the detonation of explosives that were
placed underneath the retort. Shockwaves can also be generated for
oil shale rubblization using a high-pressure gas explosion and
expansion [139]. For example, a combustible gas mixture can be
injected into an oil field, oil shale or sand formation to create a shock
wave after detonation. The particle size after rubblization is usually
on the order of inches. Land distortion and surface subsidence are
often associated with rubblization, although it significantly enhances
convective mass and heat transfer. Therefore, use of rubblization
should be limited in UCTT process unless it is imperative to increase
the permeability by this approach.

3.3. Implications for UCTT

PReview of the potential technologies suggests that wall conduc-
tion is currently the most applicable method for UCTT. Conduction
heating not only offers better process control which produces higher
quality pyrolysis products, but also leads to a uniformly permeabil-
ity. When steam or CO2 injection is used for enhancing oil extraction,
the high, uniform permeability reduces the pressure drop and pro-
vides more contact surface for gas-surface reactions. It also reduces
the number of extraction wells needed, which can be located at the
end of the gas passage through the seam. The Shell ICP, in particular,
is a proven technology that has undergone field test and produced
high quality oil. To improve thermal efficiency, the CCR process can
be considered, since direct heat exchange has a higher efficiency
than electricity generation.

4. Coal pyrolysis

PUnderstanding pyrolysis is instrumental for identifying the most
important parameters influencing product yield and composition,
which determine the economics and product quality of UCTT. Coal
pyrolysis has been well
studied and extensively reviewed
[15,23(cid:1)31]. These reviews have greatly advanced the knowledge
synthesis of coal pyrolysis, mainly for pulverized coal. A new review
of coal pyrolysis is impractical and unnecessary here. Instead, we
review the knowledge and data closely related to UCTT: 1) the pyrol-
ysis yield and product composition, and 2) the porous structure and
permeability development that impact mass and heat transfer. The
results from conventional pulverized coal pyrolysis may not be
directly applied to UCTT, due to the differences in coal size and
pyrolysis conditions. The large coal size in UCTT makes a slow heat-
ing rate more reasonable, considering the heating cost. The large
coal also features a long residence time for volatiles diffusing out,
and has strong influence on the mass and heat transfer. The pyrolysis
atmosphere may also be different if externally heated gas is used as
heat carrier. The review is focused on these respects.

4.1. Pyrolysis yield and product composition

PMost of the pyrolysis reactions are endothermic. Therefore, heat-
ing conditions have strong effects on the pyrolysis yield and product
composition, which are briefly summarized in Table 7. For a detailed
review on this topic, the reader is referred to Yu et al. [31]. In the
current work, these effects are reviewed in the context of UCTT
applications, i.e., large coal size and different pyrolysis atmosphere.

P4.1.1. Coal size

PA distinctive feature of UCTT is the large coal size. The effect of
coal size (especially large coal size) on pyrolysis yield is not well
studied compared with the other effects, such as temperature and
heating rate. Literature in this area is scarce, and sometimes, contra-
dictory [31]. For coal particles smaller than 1 mm, coal size has a
negligible impact on volatile yield. This is probably because the

Pparticle is not big enough to distinguish the heating-rate controlled
(kinetics) and diffusion-controlled (mass transfer) regime. The effect
of coal size on pyrolysis yield can be interpreted from mass transfer
and heating rate perspectives.
Increasing coal size essentially
increases the distance for volatiles diffusing out of the char and the
distance for heat conducting into the char. The former increases the
residence time of volatiles in the char and allows for more secondary
reactions and condensation reactions, which inhibits tar production
and promotes gas production. Overall, increasing coal size can be
considered as having the same effects of increasing pressure or
decreasing heating rate, both of which suppress tar production and
promote light hydrocarbon gases, as shown in Table 7. Studies on
conventional pulverized coal pyrolysis were mostly focused on sub-
millimeter coal particles, far smaller than the coal size encountered
in UCTT.

PGneshin et al. [9] used a fixed-bed reactor to study the global
kinetics of a bituminous coal at sizes relevant to UCTT. For coal cores
of up to 2 cm in diameter and 15 cm in length, they found that coal
size has a strong impact on the tar yield, although its impact is negli-
gible on total volatiles yield. The tar yield of the 2 cm diameter coal
is substantially lower than that of the coal particles of 75 mm, over a
wide range of heating temperatures (400(cid:1)600 °C). Gneshin et al. [9]
also found that the impact of coal size on tar yield is more prominent
at slow heating rates (0.1 K/min) than that at higher heating rates
(10 K/min). Tars were trapped in the pores of the large coals at slow
heating rate, whereas it is not the case at high heating rates. Little
difference, however, was found on the micro and mesoporous struc-
ture of the chars formed at the two different heating rates. Bulk
transport of tars out of the pores is a pressure-driven flow. A Knud-
sen flow analysis in the mesopore system suggests that the pressure
gradient needed to drive the tars out of the pores increases sharply
with coal size. The pressure gradient is built up by the volatiles in
the pores. Therefore, for large coals under slow heating conditions as
encountered in UCTT, the pyrolysis reaction rate is insufficient to
provide the pressure gradient to drive all the tars out of the pores.
Retention of volatile liquids for large coals at slow heating conditions
indicates a decrease of pyrolysis yield, a big difference as compared
to the pyrolysis of pulverized coal particles.

PFor large coal, low heating rates are more realistic considering
the heating cost. The review by J€untgen [26] can be used for inter-
preting low-heating rate pyrolysis. At low heating rates, devolatiliza-
tion tends to occur at lower temperatures. This will result in a
greater retention of fixed carbon and an enhancement of secondary
pyrolysis reactions, which in turn alters the final product yields [9].
A slow heating rate to about 390 °C was found to increase the ratio
of the yield of gas to condensable hydrocarbons [80,81]. As such, the
production of methane and light hydrocarbon gases can be signifi-
cantly enhanced while the yield of condensables can be decreased,
which indicates that the premium-value, high H/C ratio products
can be produced in UCTT process. The effect of heating rate on pyrol-
ysis yield is also dependent on the pyrolysis atmosphere. Khan and

PHshieh [142] compared the pyrolysis weight loss of a Pittsburgh No.
8 coal under steam and helium atmosphere. For pyrolysis under
steam atmosphere, the weight loss (volatiles yield) increased at low
heating rate (Table 8). The low heating rate, which favors more sec-
ondary reactions, In contrast, heating rate has negligible effect on
weight loss under helium atmosphere, indicating that hydrogen ele-
ment in the gas phase is critical to secondary reactions such as steam
reforming and water-gas reaction [44].

PThe large coal size also means a longer residence time for the vol-
atiles to diffuse out of the coal. Khan and Hshieh [142] studied the
weight loss of devolatilization for Pittsburgh No. 8 and Wyodak
coals, and they observed that larger weight loss correlates to a longer
residence time. They concluded that more secondary reactions occur
at longer residence time, which further decompose the coal and coal
liquids in favor of gaseous products. Unless pyrolysis temperature is
sufficiently high (above 1000 °C), the pyrolysis reactions are not fast
enough to reach thermodynamic equilibrium in such a short time.
Therefore, effect of residence time also needs to be taken into
account when analyzing pyrolysis yield. The pyrolysis product yield
(with the same heating temperature) increases with residence time.
As such, the same yield can be reached at a low heating temperature
and long residence, or at a high heating rate and short residence
time. This gives choice for UCTT operation to save energy cost while
reaching the desired yield.

P4.1.2. Pyrolysis atmosphere

PFor a non-oxidizing atmosphere, Tyler [143] reported that substi-
tuting an atmosphere of hydrogen for helium slightly increases the
tar and methane yield. More researchers found significant influence
of hydrogen and steam on pyrolysis yield and composition. These
studies are listed in Table 9.

PThe influence of steam and H2 on volatiles can be explained by
the role of hydrogen in pyrolysis reactions. The molecular structure
of coal can be conceptualized as a network of various polyaromatic
and hydroaromatic rings with aliphatic and functional groups. Pyrol-
ysis is essentially the process of destructing the network by bond-
breaking reactions and formation of new molecules. The most
important pyrolysis reactions determining the volatiles yield are the
ones involving hydrogen evolution, because: 1) hydrogen is the

Pessential element in the hydrocarbon fuel, and 2) hydrogen in the
coal structure is more prone to be depleted than carbon during the
pyrolysis process. Steam and H2 can participate in various pyrolysis
reactions by providing hydrogen, and the overall effect is to increase
pyrolysis yield [31]. For example, steam can participate in the
water-gas reaction to produce CO and H2 [44]. H2 in the pyrolysis
atmosphere can react with radicals (OH, O, and CH2) to form water
and aliphatics, as well as saturating the larger radicals to produce tar
molecules. CO2 can directly react with carbon (the Boudouard reac-
tion) to form CO at high temperatures, increasing volatiles yield. The
presence of hydrogen can result in the largest gain in volatiles yield
since hydrogen stabilizes the primary products from thermal degra-
dation.

PResearchers [144(cid:1)146] also found that the steam treatment pro-
vides a significant desulfurization effect on solid fuels and their liq-
uid products. Sulfur content in the coal is transformed into H2S.
Therefore, pyrolysis of coals and oil shales with steam yields higher
concentrations of H2, CO2, and H2S and lower contents of CO and
CH4. Yardim et al. [147] applied steam pyrolysis to four Turkish sub-
bituminous coals and also reached the same conclusion on the
occurrence of considerable desulfurization effect after steam treat-
ment. They also found that the enhanced production of volatiles
from the coals leads to a significantly higher porosity, specific sur-
face area and adsorption capacity towards iodine of the resultant
semi-cokes (Fig. 6).

PThese studies suggest that, if the retorting technology of exter-
nally generated hot gas is used in UCTT, type of the hot gas needs to
be carefully selected because it can change the yield and composi-
tion of pyrolysis products. For example, if a hydrogen-rich hot gas
(as proposed by Calderon and Laubis [122]) is used, the liquid fuel
yield will be significantly increased. If combustion exhaust gas
(which contains CO2 and steam) is used, more CO and higher H/C
ratio fuels will be produced.

P4.1.3. Implications for UCTT

PParameters that have strong effects on pyrolysis yield and prod-
uct composition are identified by reviewing the literature on con-
ventional pulverized coal pyrolysis. These parameters can be
adjusted in order to selectively promote the desired products. For
example, low heating rate can increase H/C ratio in the pyrolysis
product, and an externally generated hot gas with non-inert compo-
sition such as H2/CO2/steam can significantly increase the pyrolysis
yield and change the composition. Some of the parameters, however,
are essentially not adjustable in the UCTT process. For example, high
pressure operation is almost a natural feature for the deeply-buried
coal seam. Low heating rate is more realistic considering the large
size of coal. These natural restrictions leave only heating tempera-
ture as a tunable parameter. Since the high pressure and slow heat-
ing rate all suppress tar production, the target product of UCTT
should be light aliphatic gases such as methane. The light aliphatic
gases are high-value products with large H/C ratios. These fuels have
a high energy content per mass basis and low CO2 emissions per
energy content, compared with large molecular-weight hydrocar-
bons. A medium heating temperature of 400(cid:1)500 °C favors CH4

Pproduction over tar production, while reducing heating cost.
Although the tar yield can be decreased by a heating temperature
above 600 °C, it comes at a high heating cost. In brief, careful control
of the heating parameters and heating medium not only increases
the premium-value products, but also saves operation cost.

4.2. Porous structure and permeability

PDuring pyrolysis, coal undergoes swelling and pore development,
which subsequently determine the mass and heat transfer charac-
teristics of the coal char. This in turn impacts the pyrolysis behavior
of the coal. The change in porous structure also impacts the perme-
ability of coal seam, a key property for collecting the volatiles. Xie
et al. [155] conducted a comprehensive study on the physical, chem-
ical and thermal properties of a packed coal bed during pyrolysis.
They found that the permeability and thermal conductivity are
strongly related to the swelling and porous structure development.

PBecause of its critical role in coal pyrolysis and oxidation, the
porous structure of coal has been extensively studied and reviewed.
Yu et al. [31] reviewed the formation of porous structure during coal
devolatilization and its thermoproperties. Bar(cid:1)Ziv and Kantorovich
[156] reviewed the mutual effects of porosity and reactivity in char
oxidation. In general, porous structure development during coal
pyrolysis is highly dependent on the heating conditions: tempera-
ture, heating rate, pressure, and coal size and type. Effects of these
parameters on porous structure development are briefly summa-
rized in Table 10. In the following subsections, the review is focused
on conditions relevant to UCTT, i.e., external stress, large coal size,
and permeability development that impact mass and heat transfer.

P4.2.1. External stress

PA unique feature of UCTT is the spatial confinement of the deeply
buried coal by the overburden layer, which exerts stress on the coal.
Recently, with triaxial high pressure experimental apparatus, pyrol-
ysis-induced porosity was studied for coal blocks under strain and
stresses [82,157(cid:1)159]. The triaxial high pressure device is able to
apply mechanical or hydraulic stresses on 3 axes, which simulates
the spatial confinement of the underground environment. Studies
have shown that porosity is strongly dependent on the heating tem-
perature. The porosity decreases slightly with temperature until
200(cid:1)300 °C, and increases sharply with temperature and peaks at
400(cid:1)700 °C. Then the porosity decreases slightly again with temper-
ature. The initial decrease at low temperature can be attributed to
the closing of pores by softening of the coal and filling of the pores
by heavy tars. The sharp increase at intermediate temperature is
associated with the strong bubbling and volatiles release during
pyrolysis. The slight decrease at higher temperature is due to the
shrinking when all volatiles are released, especially under compres-
sion of overburden layer.

PAkbarzadeh and Chalaturnyk [21] attributed the shrinkage at the
final pyrolysis stage to the weakened internal structure of coal when
part of the carbon structure is consumed. Following the breakup of
bubbles and release of volatiles, the swelling loses its driving force.
Meanwhile, the internal structure of coal weakens due to the con-
sumption of organic material. As a result, shrinking occurs when the

Pcoal is compressed by the overburden layer. The shrinking behavior
influences the final porosity of the coal. The evolution of porosity
during pyrolysis is indeed a competition between bubbling and
shrinking. At an intermediate temperature (400(cid:1)650 °C), the devola-
tilization is strong and bubbling dominates the pore development,
thus the porosity increases significantly. At higher temperatures
when most of the volatiles are released, shrinking dominates pore
development, and the porosity decreases slightly.

P4.2.2. Coal size

PCoal size has a big impact on heating rate. The large coal size in
UCTT makes it hard to achieve high heating rates. Increasing heating
rate, however, leads to greater porosity. Gneshin et al. [9] found that
heating rate mainly influences the macroporous structure, provided
that the heating temperature is above 400 °C. For a bituminous coal
core of 2 cm size, a substantial
increase in macroporosity was
observed for chars produced at 10 K/min, whereas little change
occurred to the chars produced at 0.1 K/min. The macroporosity is
responsible for the mass transfer in the coal. This indicates that a
threshold heating rate exists to enhance the mass transfer by
increasing macroporosity. Realization of higher heating rates, how-
ever, requires higher heating temperature or more heating elements
per unit volume of coal. Therefore, it is important to balance this
threshold value against the costs of additional heating.

P4.2.3. New techniques for characterizing porous structure

PRecently, new techniques have successfully characterized the
coal structure. X-ray computed tomography (CT) is capable of in situ
characterization of the structural deformation of the coal sample
[160(cid:1)164]. The CT imaging allows a quantitative mapping of the
specific features inside the coal and a 3-dimensional reconstruction
of the coal structure. Following the structure reconstruction, the
swelling/shrinking strain can be calculated. CT imaging of coal core
generated by Pone et al. [163] under stress conditions is shown in
Fig. 7 as an example. Of course, the resolution of CT imaging is not as
high as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which can reach a few
nanometers. But CT imaging is capable of non-destructive probing of
the internal structure, whereas SEM imaging requires the sample to
be sliced to be able to measure its internal structure.

PLow-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) provides a quick
means of measuring the pore size distribution and porosity of shale
and coal samples [165(cid:1)170]. NMR does not suffer from many of the
inherent disadvantages of mercury porosimetry or nitrogen conden-
sation, such as the inaccuracy caused by a pore shape assumption,
long measurement time required by gas adsorption/desorption, lim-
ited pore size range caused by gas molecule size, and sample com-
pression. At present, the echo time (TE) and the waiting time (TW)
are considered as two of the key parameters when the rock porosity
is measured with low-field NMR instruments, and different litholo-
gies require different NMR experimental parameters [171(cid:1)173]. A
systematic comparison of coal pore size distribution characterization
using low-field NMR and mercury intrusion porosimetry was pro-
vided by Yao and Liu [174].

P4.2.4. Permeability development

PPermeability is the most critical measure of the mass transport
capability of a coal seam. Akbarzadeh and Chalaturnyk [21] provided
a summary of porosity and permeability development during the
pyrolysis process. In general, coal permeability can increase by 2-3
orders of magnitude due to the pyrolysis, depending on the coal
rank and heating temperature. For example, Thorsness et al. [77]
reported that the permeability of a Wyodak subbituminous coal
increases from 10 mD at 30 °C to 1200 mD at 400 °C, and further
increases to 16,000 mD at 650 °C. Comparable trends were reported
for four U.S. bituminous coals [79] and two U.K. bituminous coals
[84,85]. Zhao et al. [158] observed that the permeability of a China

Psteam coal (a coal between bituminous and anthracite) increased
moderately in 200(cid:1)300 °C and then increased exponentially at 400 °
C. The increase of permeability is less significant for the China steam
coal, whereas it is still in the range of 1000 times. In contrast, the
permeability of a China lignite coal only increases about 100 times
after pyrolysis [82]. This clearly shows that coal rank and heating
temperature are major factors influencing permeability develop-
ment, similar to the porosity development.

PSimilar trend of coal permeability and coal porosity during pyrol-
ysis suggests that the two properties are correlated. Xie et al. [155]
concluded that the rapid increase of permeability after tars have
fully evolved indicated that char structure became porous. Exponen-
tial correlations were developed to predict the coal permeability
with porosity [21,77,79]. For example, Akbarzadeh and Chalaturnyk
[21] combined the data of Zhao et al. [158] and Thorsness et al. [77]
and plotted the logarithm of permeability against the change in
porosity (Fig. 8). It must be kept in mind that initial softening of the
coal and entrapping of heavy tars can partially close or fill the pores,
leading to decreased porosity and permeability [155].

P4.2.5. Permeability modeling

PCoal permeability modeling is an active research area because of
the rising interest in using coal seams for CO2 sequestration and

Penhanced coal bed methane (ECBM) production. Various permeabil-
ity models have been developed for reservoir simulation of gas and
liquid flow in a coal bed. The models have been extensively reviewed
[60,68,175(cid:1)178]. Palmer [175] conducted a detailed review on four
of the most widely used models. Ma et al. [176] introduced their
own model based on matchstick strain and constant volume the-
ory, in addition to the review of other models. Liu et al. [60] evalu-
ated the models against laboratory data at free swelling/shrinking
conditions and field data at constant volume conditions. They con-
cluded that previous models have limited success in explaining
the field data, because of the lack of understanding of the coal
matrix-cleat interactions. Pan and Connell [68] recently provided a
complete review of a broad variety of permeability models, and
tested the models against laboratory and field data. They con-
cluded that the coupling of gas adsorption/desorption induced
swelling and shrinking is important for the accuracy of the model.
Peng et al. [178] performed a benchmark assessment of the per-
meability models against the lab and in situ data. They also found
that
the permeability models failed to explain experimental
results at conditions of the lab-controlled stresses, and only par-
tially succeeded in explaining in situ data. In light of the existing
reviews, we focus on the validity of the permeability models in
UCTT simulation, by examining their basic approaches and major
assumptions, and by comparing the CBM production conditions
with the UCTT environment.

PA consensus among the reviews is that the permeability is
linked to coal porosity, stress, and the strain of swelling/shrinking.
Coal permeability modeling is generally based on the dual porosity/
permeability concept, as shown in Fig. 2. Gas and liquid are stored
in the pores of the coal matrix, and diffuse into the cleats in
CBM production. The flow in the cleats is modeled as Darcy
flow, similar to the shale gas reservoir simulation approach. The
most widely used model to describe the coal cleat system is the
bundled matchstick concept, as shown in Fig. 9 [179]. For this
model, the flow in the cleat can be calculated by the cubic law
[180] as

meability becomes k 1⁄4 1
els the anisotropic nature and complex structure of cleats would be
considered, the above process shows the basic approach how to
relate the permeability to the porosity. The permeability is corre-
lated to the porosity with a cubic factor.

PBy examining the derivation, one can see that in the calculation
only the cleat's porosity is used, and the model assumes no contribu-
tion from the matrix porosity. This is valid in CBM or ECBM produc-
tion because the matrix porosity is relatively small compared with
the cleat porosity when there is no pyrolysis. In the UCTT process,
however, the matrix porosity increases significantly due to the
pyrolysis-induced porous structure development. In fact, an expo-
nential correlation to porosity was found for permeability develop-
ment during pyrolysis, as reviewed in the previous section.
Therefore, the current models cannot predict the significant change
in permeability during pyrolysis. Pyrolysis-induced porosity of the
coal matrix needs to be incorporated into simulations of the UCTT
process. This can be done by combining the non-pyrolysis based per-
meability models with pore models. In addition, the pyrolysis-
induced matrix swelling is stronger than the gas adsorption-induced
swelling. Correspondingly, the cleats will be compressed to an
extent larger than non-pyrolysis conditions. The parameters for
modeling the swelling effect on permeability thus need to be reeval-
uated against experimental data. The triaxial pyrolysis test cell will
be able to provide such data, by applying mechanical loading and
strain to various axes of the coal sample during pyrolysis process.

P4.2.6. Implications for mass transfer

PIn general, mass transport in coal occurs at two scales: convective
flow through the macroscopic cleats (the natural fracture system of
coal) and diffusion through the pores of the coal matrix [61(cid:1)63].
The fractures and cleats are responsible for the collection of devolati-
lization products. The macropores and mesopores are mostly
responsible for the mass transport into the cleats from the coal
matrix [31]. In principle, the diffusion resistance decreases with the

Pporosity of the coal and the pore size [182]. Therefore, the evolution
of porous structure plays a key role in determining the transport
rate of volatiles in the coal. Gneshin et al. [9] summarized the major
categories of mass transfer in coal pyrolysis as internal flow and
Knudsen flow. Internal flow mainly occurs through macropore trans-
port and bubbling, and it is the major mechanism for volatiles trans-
fer out of the coal matrix [28]. The time scale for gases moving out of
coal particles less than 100 mm is in the order of 1 ms [183]. This
suggests that as long as heating rate is below 1000 K/s, there is suffi-
cient time for gaseous volatiles transfer out of the coal particle. For
liquid volatiles, however, the situation is different. As heavy mole-
cules move through the pores, secondary reactions and coking reac-
tions may take place if the residence time is long enough, thereby
reducing the tar yield and increasing gas yield [31]. In the UCTT pro-
cess, the coal is in a large block, and the residence time for volatiles
moving into the collection wells is significantly longer than that in
particles. The extended residence time certainly is expected to affect
secondary reactions and tar coking reactions, and subsequently the
yield of tars and gases. Therefore, research on the mass transfer in
large coal blocks is necessary to understand the impact of coal size
on volatiles yield.

PThe phenomenon of Knudsen flow was first applied to petroleum
engineering problems by Klinkenberg [184], known as Klinkenberg
effect or gas slippage. Knudsen flow occurs when the mean flow
path of gas molecules is longer than the diameter of the pores.
Therefore, it mainly takes place in micropores and mesopores of coal
[68], which are generally below 50 nm. When the mean flow path of
gas molecules is longer than the pore diameter, collision between
gas molecules and pore walls becomes frequent. This significantly
increases the mass transfer resistance. Therefore, it plays an impor-
tant role when pore transport is dominant, such as the case in UCTT
in which slow heating and overburden confinement all tend to sup-
press bubbling and swelling. Studies [185(cid:1)188] on Knudsen flow of
CBM have been published. There is also abundant
literature
[189(cid:1)194] on the Knudsen flow occurring in nano-scale pores of
shale gas formations. These studies provide insight into the contri-
bution of Knudsen flow to total gas flow and lead to the develop-
ment of improved permeability models [195] including Knudsen
flow. They found that the gas flow in nano-scale pores of the shale
can be modeled with a diffusive transport regime with a constant
diffusion coefficient and negligible viscous effects. The obtained dif-
fusion coefficient is consistent with the Knudsen diffusivity which
supports the slip boundary condition at the nano-scale pore surfaces.
These studies show that Knudsen flow plays a critical role in deter-
mining the total flow, especially when the nano-scale pores are in
abundance compared to large pores. Therefore, the Knudsen flow
needs to be considered for UCTT process, where the slow heating

Pconditions do not favor the growth of large pores, especially during
the drying stage.

PIn general, coal permeability increases significantly over the
course of pyrolysis. Hydraulic fracturing or rubblization is thus not
likely to be required. Studies on coal permeability show that there is
an optimal temperature range that maximizes the permeability,
depending on the coal rank. Comprehensive consideration should be
given to the heating temperature in terms of balancing the perme-
ability, volatile yields and heating cost. For example, a bituminous
coal exposed to a heating temperature of 600(cid:1)650 °C generates a
permeability that is on the order of 10,000 mD, while this tempera-
ture also favors tar production. If a permeability of 1000 mD can
meet the production requirement, lowering the temperature to
400(cid:1)500 °C can promote gas production and save heating costs.

Pthe dimensions of the microcrystals forming the microskeleton of
char; 2) changes in the connections between the microcrystals.
Swelling and fragmentation can increase the voids in the porous
char, or narrow or even break the connections between the micro-
crystals. Therefore, for a coal particle that is free to swell, the ther-
mal conductivity can decrease significantly. For coal in UCTT, which
is constrained by the surrounding formation, swelling will close the
cleats and other fractures and lead to an increase in the thermal con-
ductivity. Furthermore, the narrowing or breaking of the connec-
tions of the microcrystals may not be as significant as in a free
swelling coal because shrinking may occur at the final stage of pyrol-
ysis. Therefore, research is needed to understand the effect of a con-
strained environment on the evolution of thermal conductivity of
the coal during pyrolysis.

P4.2.7. Implications for heat transfer

PThe porous structure development influences the heat transfer
properties of the char in two ways: heat convection through the
pores and heat conduction via the pore connections. Heat convection
increases with porosity, because increased porosity allows more
gases and liquids carrying heat into pores. Pore development is
accompanied by pore growth, carbon skeleton reorganization, and
char fragmentation. Heat conduction of porous char is proportional
to the thermal conductivity of the basal plane of microcrystals, and
is also dependent on the porosity, pore size distribution, orientation
of the microcrystals and nature of the inter-connections between
microcrystals. These structural changes certainly have great impact
on the thermal conductivity of coal during pyrolysis.

PThermal conductivity of coal particles has been extensively stud-
ied. For a review on these studies, the readers are referred to Kantor-
ovich and Bar(cid:1)Ziv [196]. In general, thermal conductivity of coal
particles decreases with organic content and porosity, whereas it
increases with temperature. Thermal conductivity of coal particles
increases with temperature in the initial pyrolysis process, due to
the structural changes [92,197]. Void space, or a pore filled with air,
essentially has zero thermal conductivity. Therefore, high porosity
results in low thermal conductivity. Zhang et al. [198] reported that
the thermal conductivity of a highly porous char significantly
decreases at the initial oxidation stage, due to narrowing or breaking
of interconnections of pores. Therefore, it is expected that the ther-
mal conductivity of coal particles will decrease during pyrolysis.

PThermal conductivity in a coal block, however, can be strikingly
different if the coal is confined to a constant volume. For a bitumi-
nous coal, the thermal conductivity at around 350 °C will increase
from 0.3(cid:1)0.4 W/(m (cid:3) K) if unconstrained [90] to 0.6 W/(m (cid:3) K) if
constrained [80,81]. For a packed coal bed that is partially confined
in a tube, the thermal conductivity can rapidly increase at the onset
of swelling because the void space between bed particles is reduced
[155]. The dewatering and devolatilization of coal lead to significant
increase of void volumes, which tend to decrease thermal conduc-
tivity. Heating rate also strongly influences thermal conductivity
because porous structure is strongly dependent on heating rate.
Slow heating allows full development of pores and rearrangement
of microcrystals that interconnect the pores. Fast heating tends to
cause thermal fragmentation [31] of the particle and break the
microcrystals that link the pores, which are the conductive media
of pores. Therefore, slow heating tends to increase the thermal con-
ductivity of coal. The thermal conductivity of a coal block under
slow heating conditions can reach 0.9 W/(m (cid:3) K) , which is 3 times
of that in an unstrained coal block with fast heating. In general,
thermal conductivity of coal is lower than that of oil shales, which
is in the range of 1-2 W/(m (cid:3) K) [199(cid:1)201]. The low thermal con-
ductivity of coal will lead to low heating rate in UCTT, compared to
underground oil shale retorting.

PBar-Ziv and Kantorovich [156] summarized that the main factors
influencing thermal conductivity of porous char are: 1) changes in

5. Process parameters, products and optimization

PA literature review on coal pyrolysis reveals the key parameters
influencing volatile yield and product composition. Dependence of
product composition on heating conditions creates opportunities for
selectively producing products. Heating conditions can be adjusted
in favor of high-value, high H/C ratio products. For example, injec-
tion of steam and H2 increases both coal conversion and tar yield.
From a mass transfer perspective, high temperature, fast heating
and medium pressure are preferred because higher permeability is
created at such conditions. From a heat transfer perspective, low
temperature and slow heating are preferred because decrease in
thermal conductivity is minimized. In addition, operation cost is
strongly associated with heating requirements. For example, high
temperature and high heating rate needs high energy input. There-
fore, heating parameters must be carefully optimized for the UCTT
process, considering the yield, quality, and heating cost.

5.1. Temperature and heating rate

PFor oil shale, kinetic data [202(cid:1)204] show that the time needed
to decompose the kerogen depends strongly on temperature. For
example, Berchenko et al. [203] found that for one sample at 370 °C,
90% decomposition occurs within 5000 minutes, while at 500 °C, it
was within 2 min. To maximize the decomposition yield, a high heat-
ing temperature is desired. However, slowly heating to a relatively
low temperature can reduce heating and facility costs. In Shell's oil
shale ICP [113], the heating period is 2(cid:1)4 years, corresponding to
less than 0.5 °C/day. The heating period for Shell's ICP process is typi-
cal among shale conversion approaches, i.e., 7-8 years for ExxonMo-
bil's Electrofrac [127] and 1-2 years for Mountain West Energy's IVE
[205]. The operation temperatures for underground oil shale process-
to a range of 340(cid:1)400 °C
ing in most approaches were set
[113,114,127,205]. It is noted that in TUST's Hot Alkane Convection
and Western Research Institute's TREE approaches, the convection
gases were heated to 700 °C. This gas temperature will probably lead
to similar shale temperatures as other approaches, considering the
temperature drop between hot gas and shale formation.

PSimilar principles apply to coal. A tradeoff must be made
between volatile yield and energy cost by adjusting temperature
and heating rate. In addition, the proportion of liquid and gaseous
yields is strongly dependent on temperature and heating rate. Maxi-
mum yield is reached at high temperatures, whereas tar production
is promoted at mild heating temperatures of 450(cid:1)650 °C [206]. A
slow heating rate to 390 °C increases the ratio of gas to condensable
hydrocarbons [80,81]. The production of methane also can be signifi-
cantly enhanced by minimizing the yield of condensables. This is a
huge advantage because methane is a high hydrogen fuel that mini-
mizes CO2 emissions. It also needs to be kept in mind that UCTT will
require a higher temperature than oil shale retorting, because coal is
shale [122].

PConsidering all these factors, a heating temperature of 400(cid:1)500 °C
with a slow to medium heating rate is recommended for UCTT pro-
cess. This temperature range will yield most of the aliphatic gases,
tar and other liquid hydrocarbons at a balanced energy cost. Detailed
breakdown of temperature ranges for different products are listed in
Table 11 [141].

Poften used as the heat source. This stream of gases with hydrogen
rich content is also recommended to augment coal conversion even
when electrical heating is used. The recycled gas can diffuse into the
formation and be exhausted to the surface after heat exchange with
coal. Pyrolysis gases can be used to fire a gas turbine to generate
electricity in addition to being used as a carrier for recycling energy.
PRecently, solar and wind technologies have undergone significant
development for meeting future energy needs. The levelized costs of
electricity by solar photovoltaic and land-based wind turbine are
projected to becoming comparable (with tax credits) to natural gas-
fired combined cycle power plants in 2022 [207]. In addition, solar
thermal technologies can be directly utilized for providing heat for
the energy conversion process. For example, concentrated solar sys-
tem with a fluidized bed core [208] can provide high-temperature
heating gases at relatively low cost. Therefore, wind and solar have
great potential for UCTT. In addition, the intermittent supply of
energy from solar and wind is less of a concern for UCTT than in gen-
erating electricity for the grid.

5.2. Pressure

5.4. Product yield

PIn general, increasing pressure reduces total yield, particularly for
high-volatile coals. As pressure increases, the tar yield and total yield
drops sharply, while the gaseous volatiles increase significantly. In
UCTT process, the coal is deeply buried and the pressure can reach
30(cid:1)100 atm. At such high pressures, the tar yield can be reduced by
50% while the light hydrocarbon gas yield can be increased by 50%
[141].

PFor UCTT, the lithostatic pressure can reach 30(cid:1)300 atm in deeply
buried coal seams. As such, a high-pressure pyrolysis process is often
chosen by default. Shell reported its UCTT process is maintained under
pressures of up to 30 atm [80,81]. When a stream of gaseous fuels is
produced from UCTT, it can be used to fire a gas turbine for electricity.
The produced gas stream needs to be pressurized for transport and
power generation. Therefore, a selection of a high operating pressure
(of steam, CO2, air or O2) in underground thermal treatment does not
increase the overall cost much. For underground oil shale retorting,
due to different overburden thickness and operational considerations,
the operation pressure was 2(cid:1)30 atm in the Shell
ICP process
[42,203], 160 atm in the ExxonMobil's Electrofrac process [127], and
88 atm in the Mountain West Energy's IVE process [205].

PSelection of operating pressure is also influenced by other design
considerations, such as safety of personnel and equipment. During
the underground heating stage, the porosity inside the coal forma-
tion increases dramatically as volatiles leave the coal. Subsidence
and compaction of the formation becomes a possible issue, which
could endanger the surface workers and underground equipment. A
high operating pressure in the formation will prevent the subsi-
dence, thus protecting the workers and equipment.

5.3. Heating sources

PHeating sources can be obtained off site or on site, and the heat-
ing cost can be quite high depending on the sources. In Shell's ICP,
electrical heating was used and the electricity cost for oil shale
retorting is estimated to be $12(cid:1)15 per barrel [53]. The electricity
can be purchased from grid, i.e., off site. In this manner, the loss dur-
ing long-distance transmission will increase the cost. The electricity
can also be generated onsite using coal, gas, nuclear power and
renewable energy sources. The produced gas generated from under-
ground oil shale thermal treatment is a natural source of fuel for a
gas-fired power-plant. Similar conclusions can be reached for UCTT.
PWaste gases generated during the coal conversion can be heated
and injected into the coal seam as a heat carrier. For approaches
using externally generated hot gases, gaseous hydrocarbon fuels are

reactions of hydrogen to form water, light aliphatic gases, and even
H2 [28,31] makes it impossible to completely convert the coal into
gaseous and liquid fuels, with much of its carbon remaining as char.
Conversion ratios of other coal-to-liquid technologies (direct lique-
faction, syngas-to-liquid) are generally in the range of 1-2 barrel of
oil per ton of coal. The conversion ratio of pyrolysis is obviously
lower than direct liquefaction because much of the carbon remains
as char. Even for a high-volatile bituminous coal that has a volatile
fraction of 40%, the maximum pyrolysis yield in theory is about 2
barrels of oil equivalent per ton of coal.

PCoal pyrolysis yield is strongly dependent on heating conditions.
Although increasing heating temperature and heating rate can
increase product yield, a low-to-medium temperature is recom-
mended in the UCTT process considering the heating cost. Product
yield also is influenced by other operating parameters. For example,
the composition of an externally generated hot gas may determine
the decomposition rate and product distribution. Injection of steam,
H2 or CO2 will alter both the yield and composition of the pyrolysis
product. Graff and Brandes [154] and Sharma et al. [148,149] reported
the increase of tar yields with steam in coal devolatilization.

5.5. Product composition and quality

PHigh valuable oils are the most desired product of underground
thermal treatment of oil shale and coal. In particular, light oils that
need little upgrading have the highest value as transportation fuels.
POil and gas are the main products in oil shale retorting. The syn-
thetic crude obtained from underground oil shale retorting can have
a H/C ratio of 1.9 [42], which has very high quality and high volatility
compared to same molecular weight species. The quality of the syn-
thetic crude obtained from kerogen is often characterized by the API
gravity. According to API manual [49], light crude oil has an API grav-
ity of higher than 31.1 (less than 870 kg/m3), and medium crude oil
has an API gravity between 22.3 and 31.1 (870 to 920 kg/m3). The
Shell ICP syncrude has an API gravity larger than 30, and General
Synfuels International’ Omnishale technology claimed their API
gravity to be about 45 [98]. These are in high quality, light crude oil
range. Water is also a byproduct no matter how good the de-water-
ing operation is before the extraction. Not much information is avail-
able for the synthesis gas composition, although it should be very
similar to coal derived syngas that consists of CH4, H2, CO and other
light gases [209,210].

PFor UCTT, the selection of final products would be based on the
economics and demand for products. Kelly et al. [7] reported the
pyrolysis yield of a Utah Sufco coal (a high-volatile, low-moisture
bituminous coal) using a high pressure rubblized-bed reactor to sim-
ulate the effect of overburden pressure at 333 m depth. The gaseous
and liquid volatiles are listed in Table 12 and Table 13, respectively.
The gaseous product is a low-to-medium heating value syngas, while
the liquid product has an elemental composition similar to conven-
tional crude oil. Uncertainty analysis [7] shows that the LHV of the
gaseous and liquid product combined ranges from 1.22 £ 104 to
1.93 £ 104 kJ/kg. The moderate content of CO2 in the gaseous prod-
uct reduces the flame speed (a risk of flashback) of the syngas and
suppresses NOx formation when burning in gas turbines, although it
lowers the heating value of the product.

PKhan and Hshieh [142] reported that rapidly heating coal leads to
poorer quality tars in terms of H/C ratio. Primary products obtained
at higher heating rates contain loosely bounded fragments of coal
that inherit many functional characteristics of the parent structures.
Rapid heating rate also leads to less volatile pyrolysis liquids, with
relative higher fractions of poly-phenolic compounds and a lower
content of alkane/neutral aromatic compounds. In comparison, slow

Pheating improves the quality of liquid products with less rings,
although slow heating yields a higher amount of gaseous volatiles.

PVinegar et al. [80,81] in their in situ coal pyrolysis obtained coal
liquids with an API gravity of 23(cid:1)36 by slow heating, and found that
the API gravity increases with decreasing heating rate. Furthermore,
no tar was formed because of the slow heating, as shown in Table 14.
Therefore, many disadvantages of tar formation are eliminated,
including the clogging of pores, the low quality of coal liquids, and
higher levels of air pollution. Tar formation in the two fluidized bed
experiments [211] resulted in an API gravity of 2(cid:1)17 (specific grav-
ity of 1.061(cid:1)1.240). These products contain significant fraction of
devolatilization bottoms (fractional distillation temperature above
370 °C), which need to be upgraded.

PTable 14 shows that UCTT results in a comparable yield of gas-
eous products as a fluidized bed gasification process. The total gas
yield subtracting CO2 is about 10% for all three processes. Despite
the similar yield, the gas composition and quality have dramatic dif-
ferences, as shown in Table 15. Coal gasification with oxygen pres-
ence (air or pure oxygen) results in a high content of oxygenated
gases [80,81]. CO from gasification is about 2(cid:1)5 times that from
UCTT, and CO2 is 1-2 times. If air is used, then almost 50% of the
product is nitrogen. UCTT results in negligible N2, with a small per-
centage of CO and CO2. The major components from UCTT in an inert
atmosphere are CH4 (43%), H2 (26.9%), and C2+ (10.8%) [7]. The syn-
thesis gas from UCTT has a high heating value of 24702.3 MJ/Nm3,
which is 2(cid:1)4 times of that from gasification processes. Pyrolysis in a
reducing atmosphere [80,81] can make the CH4 content and heating
value even higher, approaching substitute natural gas (SNG).

PTable 14 also suggests that the liquids proportion is a not a major
contributor to the total yield. This is particularly true for large coal
blocks under slow heating conditions, due to the retention of liquids
in the pores [9,206]. In addition, the liquids often need further
upgrading to be able to meet refinery requirements. The gaseous
products are easier to collect compared to liquids, due to the lower
resistance in mass transport. Therefore, the UCTT process should tar-
get maximizing gaseous fuels. As shown in Table 15, synthesis gas
produced in UCTT has a much higher CH4 content compared to the
synthesis gas produced by coal gasification. Gasification syngas con-
sists of mainly CO and H2 with a lower heat content. The heating
value of syngas from UCTT is 2(cid:1)5 times that of syngas from gasifica-
tion. Therefore, UCTT leads to a high quality gas stream, which off-
sets its lower liquid yield in. It is well documented in the literature
that higher operating pressures correlate to higher yield of gaseous
products and improve the quality of liquids. Fortunately, the deeply
buried coal seam provides a natural environment for high pressure
operation.

6. Economics

Penergy consumed in extraction and processing of that resource,
"Energy Returned on Energy Invested" (EROEI). Significant variation
exists in the energy returns for different technologies. In addition,
care must be taken when comparing EROEIs to ensure that the sys-
tem boundaries, internal energy, and end products are well defined.
For example, EREOIs are significantly higher for wellhead products
than for refined fuels because upgrading and refining require addi-
tional energy. Internal energy is generated during shale and UCTT
resource extraction and processing, and this can be used to power
the process itself.

PCleveland and O'Connor [212] summarized EROEI estimates for
oil shale processing technologies in the range of 2(cid:1)16 for products
at the wellhead, considering only the external energy. Depending on
the specifics of the process, EROEIs for oil shale products decrease to
less than 1-2 if one considers refined products and internal energy is
included in the calculation. According to the Brandt et al.
[42,213,214], the EROEI of ex-situ oil shale processing is 1(cid:1)3, and
the EROEI for in situ shale processing is 1.2(cid:1)2.5.

PThe same evaluation approach can be applied to coal conversion.
Coal liquefaction has an estimated EROEI of 0.5(cid:1)8.2 [215], based on
the General Accounting Office report [216]. Wellington et al. [217]
estimated the EROEI of a UCTT process in Shell's patents. They pro-
pose to apply conduction to heat the coal to 390 °C for gas and oil
production and then gasify the remaining char underground for syn-
gas production (i.e., UCTT + UCG). They estimated the total energy
output from the synthesis natural gas and synthetic crude to be
more than 20 times the energy input needed for heating elements.
This EROEI is surprisingly high although it is for the wellhead prod-
uct, uses the product from gasifying the char to provide process
energy, and excludes this internal energy from EROEI calculation. In
contrast, Kelly et al. [7] estimated a net energy return (NER) for gaso-
line produced by UCTT for a low-moisture, high-volatile coal ranged
from 0.4(cid:1)4.5. Their NER accounts for the energy needed to drill
wells, heat the formation, and recover, refine, and transport the
products. It does not account for electricity transmission loss, gas
separation, and environmental protection. They found that the NER
decreases after 1 year because large volumes of coal are heated to
low temperatures, resulting in little product. Consequently, the
operation time would need to be balanced with capital costs. In sum-
mary, they concluded that the NER and GHG emissions for UCTT are
less favorable than those for oil sands and are in the general range of
that for oil shale.

PIt can be difficult to compare energy return for different pro-
cesses, such as coal and oil shale in situ approaches. Even for the
same process, researchers provided drastically different estimations.
For example, the Shell ICP originally claimed a very favorable energy
return of 3(cid:1)3.5. The energy return was revised down by Brandt et al.
[42,213,214] to 1.2(cid:1)1.6 for the refined product, including internal
energy and up to 2.5 excluding internal energy. The large difference
resulted from the inclusion of additional, necessary energy inputs,
from using refined gasoline as the product, and from including the
internal energy in the calculation. Shell only considered the well-
head product and the electricity cost in estimating their energy bal-
ance, leaving out energy needs in preliminary operations, drilling,
pumping, freezing wall, and remediation. Such differences are com-
mon because the cost estimation is usually overly optimistic when a
new technology is trying to gain acceptance. Merrow et al. [218]
estimated that the actual capital investments of new energy pro-
cesses have been routinely understated by 100%.

6.2. Process optimization

PThe UCTT process can be optimized to reduce the operation costs
and enhance product values products. Heating conditions can be
adjusted in favor of high-value, high H/C ratio products. A demon-
strative control parameter is the selection of operating pressure. It is

Pwell documented in the coal literature that higher operating pres-
sures increase the yield of gaseous products (SNG) and improve the
quality of liquids. High pressure operation also reduces the size of
collection conduits and the cost of product gas compression.

POther operating parameters, such as temperature and heating
rate, can be adjusted to achieve a better return on the investment.
However, market demands change over time and UCTT takes a long
operation time. Therefore, the process design should incorporate
flexibility so that key parameters can be adjusted when the market
changes.

PCost can also be reduced if some of the costly steps in coal con-
version can be eliminated or reduced. This is the basic incentive
behind the UCTT process by greatly reducing the costly reclamation
of the mining pit and treatment of spent char. Although environ-
mental damages cannot be completely eliminated by in situ produc-
tion, the burdens are lighter. Another cost-reduction strategy is to
minimize the need for upgrading products. Retorting with air and/or
oxygen will lead to very heavy fuel liquids (specific gravity of
1.061(cid:1)1.240) with an API gravity of 2(cid:1)17 that need to be upgraded,
which certainly increases the cost [211,219]. Shell claimed a cost
reduction of $6(cid:1)10 per barrel from their in situ coal conversion pro-
cess [80,81] by eliminating the upgrading step. However, their in
situ method has lower yields of liquid fuels compared to direct com-
bustion conversion. It is also possible to convert the remaining char
into syngas as suggested by Shell, which may reduce cost but
increase GHG emissions.

PUsing the remaining char matrix as a CO2 reservoir can also pro-
vide incentives for cost reduction. The porous structure of the char
matrix needs to be characterized for accurate prediction of its capac-
ity for CO2 adsorption.

7. Technical challenges and environmental issues

PChallenges and issues in the development of UCTT process can be
anticipated to be largely similar to those encountered in under-
ground oil shale retorting and UCG processes. These challenges and
issues, however, are inevitably influenced by the unique characteris-
tics of coal seam compared to oil shale and the differences between
pyrolysis and gasification. The technical challenges and environmen-
tal issues are described in this section.

7.1. Site selection and exploration

PSite selection for a UCTT process is primarily determined by two
factors: economics and environmental impact. Because UCTT targets
deeply buried coal, the thickness of coal must meet a minimum
requirement for the process to be economically feasible. The depth
also poses challenges for gathering geology and hydrogeology data
for the coal surrounding formations, and for directional drilling that
is in parallel to the coal seam. Regarding site selection criteria, those
of underground coal gasification can be used as a reference [2]: (1)
minimum 4.2 m thick; (2) depth of 600(cid:1)1200 m; (3) 4500 m away
from abandoned mine working license areas and (4) greater than
100 m vertical separation from major aquifers. The minimum coal
thickness may need to increase because UCTT has much lower yield
and thermal efficiency than UCG. The restrictions on separation dis-
tances, however, may not be as strict as UCG because UCTT has lower
subsidence and water-contamination risks. The thermal heating of
coal seams may cause surrounding formations to crack or fracture,
or change the mechanical properties of rocks. Such changes are asso-
ciated with risks of gas leakage, land distortion and overburden layer
collapse. All these potential risks need to be thoroughly evaluated in
selecting the appropriate site. A geological survey is a necessary step
in this evaluation.

PThe heating value and physical properties of the coal need to be
considered. High-volatile bituminous coal is the ideal candidate for a

PUCTT process. Selection criteria of the site also need to include the
potential for CO2 sequestration. The massive pore network after coal
pyrolysis is an attractive candidate for CO2 storage. The geology data
of the surrounding formations need to be evaluated for potential
CO2 leakage or reactions with CO2.

7.2. Heat management

PConsidering the lower yield of valuable oils and the higher heat-
ing temperature of UCTT compared to underground oil shale retort-
ing, the energy return of UCTT is likely lower than underground oil
shale retorting. Therefore, heat management is critical to ensure
thermal efficiency and economics of the process. Heat transfer is
probably the biggest challenge in UCTT because: (1) coal has a
greater heat capacity than oil shale while it requires higher pyrolysis
temperature than oil shale; (2) the evolution of thermal conductivity
in large coal blocks during the pyrolysis process is not well under-
stood; (3) the increase in porosity of coal during pyrolysis creates
void space for heat convection. The large heat capacity and high
heating temperature requires vast heat input. The evolution of heat
transfer properties requires dynamic adjustment of heat input and
intensity along with the progress of the process. This requirement
poses great challenges to the transient response of the heating sys-
tem and real-time assessment of the coal properties, which are
inherently slow given the large scale of the heating system and the
huge depth of the coal seam. The wall conduction and volumetric
heating methods (electric, radio frequency or microwave) have the
advantage in fast response to the requirement of adjusting heating
temperature and intensity. In comparison, externally heated gas
method has much slower response because it takes a long time for
the gas temperature to be changed and to be transported to the
deeply buried coal. The fuel cell method inherently lacks the flexibil-
ity in adjusting the operating temperature.

PThe increase of void space during pyrolysis process creates the
opportunity for convective heating, which is more efficient than con-
ductive heating. Good use of convective heating can significantly
reduce the heating cost and turn-around time of the UCTT process.
Externally heated gas method has significant advantage in convec-
tive heating, especially when the coal is heated by direct contact
with the heated gas. For example, heated CO2 can easily diffuse into
the micropores of the coal [220], making it an ideal candidate for
convective heating. In contrast, N2 takes a much longer time to dif-
fuse into the micropores of the coal [220]. Use of externally heated
gas also improves volatiles collection by promoting convective mass
transfer. While the diffusion of heating gases into pores brings in
heat, it also helps drive the volatiles out of the pores.

PSelection of the heating scheme is driven by comprehensive con-
siderations of the unique heat transfer properties of coal and its
dynamic evolution with pyrolysis process, as well as the characteris-
tics of the heating methods.

7.3. Environmental issues

PThe primary environmental concerns for UCTT are water con-
sumption, water contamination, GHG and air pollutant emissions,
and land disturbance. The UCTT process has lower environmental
burdens compared with UCG, and it offers benefits over traditional
coal mining and above-ground combustions. It eliminates the min-
ing process, coal transportation, ash disposal, particulate matter
emissions and air pollutant emissions of coal combustion. It also
avoids the mining hazards that coal miners face, such as coal dust
explosions, firedamp explosions, roof collapsing, and lung diseases.

PUCTT has similar types of environmental concerns compared to
UCG and underground oil shale retorting, as these processes share
some common features. The impact of UCTT, however, can be much
smaller than UCG because of UCTT's non-oxidizing environment.

PTable 16 provides a brief summary of the environmental issues of
UCTT compared to UCG and underground oil shale retorting. The
potential solutions are also suggested by leveraging the solutions for
UCG and underground oil shale retorting. Detailed discussions are
presented in subsections.

PWhen comparing fuels derived from UCTT to other transportation
fuel sources, it is important to consider the fuel's entire life cycle,
from raw material extraction to transportation, processing (includ-
ing upgrading), refining, and delivery to the pump. Comparisons of
life-cycle metrics, such as CO2 footprint, can be difficult between
UCTT, oil shale, and conventional crude sources. Even for the same
process, researchers sometimes provide drastically different estima-
tions because of different assumptions and system boundaries.
Table 17 provides a summary of life-cycle assessment (LCA) metrics
for benchmarking UCTT to more widely-studied processes. These
metrics are discussed in more detail in the following subsections.

P7.3.1. Water consumption and disposal

PLife-cycle water consumption for UCTT could not be identified.
However, because of process similarities, UCTT's water consumption
is anticipated to be in the same ballpark as underground oil shale
processing. Extensive water consumption is not uncommon during
underground oil shale processing. The Shell ICP requires 3 barrels of
water per barrel of oil equivalent produced [98]. Water is usually
consumed in underground thermal treatment of coal and oil shale in
two ways: heat carrier (steam) and flush agent. If steam is used for
heating the coal or oil shale, large quantities of clean water are
needed for producing steam. Water is also used to recover the
remaining hydrocarbons at the end of the thermal treatment pro-
cess. In the Shell ICP, water equivalent to 20 times of pore volumes
was injected into the production wells for oil recovery [112]. Once
the process finishes, clean water is pumped underground to drive
the contaminated water out for cleanup. This step repeats until the
water meets environmental regulations. Large consumption of water
is a serious problem in water-scarce region. If CO2 sequestration fol-
lows the UCTT process, the remaining hydrocarbon products can be
driven out of coal by CO2 instead of water. This will reduce the con-
sumption of clean water and the cost associated with water cleanup.
Separation of CO2 with hydrocarbon fuels and reusing is a common
practice in CO2-enhanced oil recovery. Water is also required for the
generation of electricity, needed to heat the formation, and for
upgrading and refining the UCTT product. Over its life cycle, the Shell
ICP process is estimated to require 10 to 20% more water than con-
ventional crude [212], as shown in Table 17.

PIn addition, water can be produced during underground thermal
treatment. Underground water often fills pores and fractures, and
water in large void volumes may even form subterranean aquifers.
Liquid water's heat capacity is 4 times of that of oil shale rock, and
water absorbs a large amount of heat that could be used to heat the
shale [42,43]. Therefore, water needs to be removed before heating
and extraction operation starts. Dewatering wells are drilled to
remove formation water although some of the water will remain.
For example, the remaining undrainable water accounts for about
7% of the shale bulk volume after dewatering [112]. Similar issues
are present in underground coal thermal treatment. Water needs to
be pumped out before heat treatment. If hydraulic fracturing is used
to increase the permeability of the coal seam, water needs to be
processed before it can be disposed. This is because chemical addi-
tives are often used in the fracturing water to prevent pipe corrosion
or as a proppant.

P7.3.2. Water contamination and treatment

PContamination of underground or ground water is probably the
most prominent environmental concern in underground thermal
treatment of oil shale and coal. For example, in the Shell ICP the
remaining water occupies about 7% of shale bulk volume after the

contamination to surrounding aquifers. As in UCG, typical hydrocar-
bon pollutants include phenols, benzene, PAHs and heterocyclics
[2,222]. Among the inorganic species, heavy metals, ammonia and
cyanides were the most serious group of contaminants [222]. Forma-
tion and transport of these contaminants is strongly dependent upon
heating conditions and the site. For example, formation of PAHs is
accelerated at high heating rates. In a two-week UCG field test at the
experimental mine Barbara in Poland, Kapusta et al. [222] observed
these major hydrocarbon and inorganic contaminants in the process
water and nearby ground water. They also observed an interesting
phenomenon that the ground water self-restored to original condi-
tions 200 days after the test ended.

PGround water contamination by UCTT, however, should be a
much lower concern than for UCG because of the slow heating rate
and the remaining char behaving as a huge molecular sieve to hold
the contaminants. As long as the remaining water does not leak into

Pthe surroundings, the contamination of ground water by UCTT can
be minimized. In UCG, the char is converted to syngas and only
the ash remains. The remaining ash has little capability to hold
contaminants, and may even collapse causing ground subsidence.
The most well-known case is the UCG site in Hoe Creek, Wyom-
ing, where poor siting and operation led to cavity roof collapse

PAnother source of water contamination is hydraulic fracturing. If
hydraulic fracturing is used for enhancing permeability, additives
are often used for various purposes such as anti-corrosion and fric-
tion reduction. When the fracturing fluids return to the surface, they
can bring trace contaminants to the surface from the underground.
These fracturing-fluids can contaminate surface and ground water,
and they require treatment before disposal or reuse. For a detailed
summary of chemical additives used in hydraulic fracturing and
water management issues arising from hydraulic fracturing, the

Pprovided an overview of the public health risks due to hydraulic
fracturing.

PThe major water protection strategies include prevention and
post-processing cleanup. Shell proposed an innovative technique to
prevent water contamination [113]. A freeze wall was established in
their demonstration case by drilling wells 2.5 m apart from each
other and circulating a refrigerant at ¡40 °C through the wells [42].
The freeze wall stopped the flow of water between the established
retorting cell and the surrounding volume, and contained the water
contamination within the boundary of the heating zone. Shell ICP
also employed another water treatment technique involving a
cleanup step after retorting. At the end of the process, underground
water was pumped to the surface for hydrocarbon and water separa-
tion. The cleaned water was injected back into the underground cell,
and the process repeated until the water met environmental stand-
ards. Monitoring wells should also be drilled to examine the changes
in underground ecosystems, including water, temperature, pressure
and bacterial populations.

PCareful evaluation of the UCTT site is the first step in minimizing
water contamination. A drinking water-quality aquifer should be
avoided. In UK, a minimum of 100 m separation distance was pro-
posed for UCG [236]. Although the UCTT process has significant
advantages over UCG in terms of potential water contamination, the
100 m separation distance should be used a first approximate.

P7.3.3. Greenhouse gas and pollutant emissions

PProducing fuels from underground oil shale processing generates
more GHG emissions than from regular oil extraction on a per barrel
oil equivalent basis, because hydrocarbon fuels are burned to heat
the oil shale to recover products, as shown in Table 17. Brandt et al.
[42,213,214] concluded that fuel produced from the Shell ICP pro-
cess generates 21(cid:1)47% more GHG emissions than conventional
petroleum production. Kelly et al. [7] reported that gasoline pro-
duced from UCTT generated at least 1.4 times more GHG emissions
than a refined fuel from the Shell ICP process, although UCTT's GHG
emissions are highly dependent on the properties of the coal forma-
tion. The UCTT GHG emissions are generally within the wider range
of GHG emissions reported for fuels produced from oil shale or from
coal-to-liquid fuel production via the Fischer Tropsch process
(Table 17). Using the waste heat of a fuel cell as heating source, how-
ever, can significantly improve the process efficiency and reduce CO2
emissions [102]. However, oil shales tend to have larger quantities of
carbonate minerals than coal, and when oil shale is heated to 565 °C
or higher these carbonate minerals begin to decompose and release
CO2 [108,230].

PThe porous char network left by the UCTT process is an ideal CO2
sequestration site. Injection of CO2 into UCTT site can actually help
drive the remaining hydrocarbons out of the char network, thus
improving production yield.
Indeed, studies [186,237,238] have
already started on enhancing CBM recovery via CO2 sequestration.
White et al. [74] provided a review on the previous work in this
area. CO2 is also a common flushing agent for enhanced oil recovery
[226]. However, public concerns exist over the long-term safety of
CO2 storage.

PA UCTT process would result in air pollution emissions from site
preparation, well drilling, power generation, product separation and
transport. These burdens would be similar to those from an in situ
oil shale development process, which are discussed in detail in Kelly
et al. [8]. Fugitive gas leakage is a concern for a UCTT process similar
to an oil shale process. The high-pressure gaseous products may leak
through the cracks or fractures in the overburden layer. Coal con-
tains more oxygen than oil shale. It can be expected that more oxy-
genated species will be formed during UCTT. Liu et al. [239] reported
that in addition to CO and CO2, nitrogen-containing species such as
HCN, NH3, and NOx can also be produced during coal pyrolysis. Coal
also contains more sulfur content than oil shale, and this sulfur will

Pbe converted to H2S or other species during pyrolysis, which are sig-
nificant pollutants.

PThe operating pressure for underground thermal treatment
needs to be maintained below the lithostatic pressure of the over-
burden formation to prevent out-leakage of gas. Precise control of
the heating temperature can also reduce the formation of sulfur
gases and oxygenated gases, as these gases are favored at a relatively
high temperature range [12,13]. As in UCG, installation of monitor-
ing wells in permeable strata above the pyrolysis zone will provide
early detection of gas escape [17]. Regular water sampling and moni-
toring will also help detect leakage of gases into underground water.

P7.3.4. Land use and restoration

PRubblization, hydraulic fracturing, heating, and site preparation/
operation all lead to land disturbance. When UCTT operations com-
plete, land-restoration will be necessary. Most underground oil shale
thermal treatment techniques require a rubblization step that often
uses explosions. Underground rubblization can cause surface distor-
tion or even subsidence, and surface damage to the surface need to
be restored production. In some modified in situ processes [106], oil
shale was mined to create void space for rock expansion during
rubblization. The mined rock was often processed ex situ for oil and
gas. Due to the higher permeability of coal, rubblization is often not
necessary in UCTT. Therefore, the damage of UCTT to landscape and
underground formations is much smaller compared to underground
oil shale retorting.

PHeating the coal formation may cause coal swelling, release of
volatiles, and/or fracturing of the overburden and underburden
rocks, potentially leading to land distortion. Real-time monitor-
ing of the subsurface pressure is necessary to adjust heating rate
and prevent over-expansion of the surrounding formations and
overburden layer. Hydraulic fracturing can also cause surface dis-
tortion and land damage. The recent large-scale shale-gas opera-
tions have led to increased experience with hydraulic fracturing,
which can be leveraged in UCTT to minimize environmental
impact.

PThe stability of overburden is also dependent upon the mechani-
cal properties of the coal layer, particularly the strength and stiff-
ness. Akbarzadeh and Chalaturnyk [21] reviewed the influence of
temperature on coal strength and stiffness. They concluded that the
shear strength and stiffness generally decrease with temperature, as
evidenced by the decrease of shear modulus and elastic modulus
with temperature. As a result, the overall coal structure is expected
to be weakened. Akbarzadeh and Chalaturnyk [21] suggest that the
influence of temperature on mechanical properties be included in
geomechanical simulation to better predict the effect of under-
ground coal thermal conversion on the strata. As coal is being
heated, it undergoes softening, thermoplastic transformation, swell-
ing and porous structure development. When devolatilization com-
pletes, gas leaves the porous structure and the coal shrinks,
exhibiting compressional deformation [90,157,195]. Heating the
coal also generates cracks and fractures [240,241]. At higher temper-
ature, coal specimens generally fail under smaller compressive (or
shear) stress while exhibiting larger axial
(or shear) strain
[90,240,242]. To alleviate the impacts of UCTT on overburden layer,
slow heating is recommended. Slow heating results in a mild change
in coal structure by reducing the extent of swelling and formation of
cracks, because of the lower devolatilization rate and smaller ther-
mal gradient in coal.

8. Future research perspectives

PA literature review of coal pyrolysis shows that although
there are numerous studies on coal pyrolysis, they were mostly
conducted on micron-to-millimeter sized coal particles for con-
ventional pulverized coal combustion and gasification. For these

Psize ranges, the effects of temperature, heating rate, and pressure
on pyrolysis yield and composition of coal particles are well
understood. Mass transfer effects, however, did not receive much
attention because of the small particle size. Applicability of the
results of pulverized coal pyrolysis in underground coal pyrolysis
has yet to be validated. Pyrolysis of large-size coals in an under-
ground environment has distinctive features that are not typi-
cally present in conventional pulverized coal pyrolysis [141]. The
coal size is several orders of magnitude larger than coal powders,
which introduces non-negligible heat and mass transfer effects.
Coal swelling and pore growth that are characteristic in pulver-
ized coal pyrolysis are spatially constrained by the overburden
layer and surrounding formations. At the onset of pyrolysis,
mass transfer is limited to native pores and cleats, making prod-
uct diffusion and collection far more difficult than in a high-
porosity particle. Swelling of coal under the spatial constraints
may close the cleats and fractures, further reducing the perme-
ability of coal seam. Heat transfer in coal blocks is also hindered
due to the reliance on conduction over larger length scales. Ther-
mal conductivity of coal, which strongly depends on the pore
structure, is not well understood because pore growth is limited
by the spatial constraint. The largely different pore growth and
transport properties

in turn impact

PThese distinctive characteristics create a knowledge gap in the
fundamental understanding of coal pyrolysis in UCTT environment.
For devolatilization of coal blocks, there is scarcity in literature
regarding the kinetics and transport phenomena under slow heating
and mechanical loading conditions. Furthermore, literature is scarce
regarding the life-cycle impacts of UCTT, with a particular lack of
information on water consumption. In addition, because UCTT is a
relatively new concept, challenges exist in correlating the lab-scale
data to system level towards field operation. The knowledge gap and
challenges are defined in this review. Research needs are proposed
to bridge the gap and solve the challenges.

8.1. Heat transfer

PHeat transfer in underground coal pyrolysis heavily depends on
coal properties. A signature of coal pyrolysis is the porous structure
evolution. Pores open up and grow as volatiles form bubbles and
leave the coal. The evolution of coal's pore structure during pyrolysis
determines the thermal conductivity of the coal [196]. The narrow-
ing and breaking of microcrystals that occurs during pore growth
tends to reduce the thermal conductivity. The pore growth, however,
is suppressed by the overburden layer and surrounding formation.
Therefore, the spatial constraint of underground coal pyrolysis helps
ease the reduction of thermal conductivity caused by pyrolysis.
Meanwhile, the suppression of pore growth also undermines the
potential benefit of convective heating. Therefore, the overall impact
of spatial constraint on heat transfer of the coal during pyrolysis pro-
cess depends on whether conduction or convection dominates the
heat transfer.

PFor wall conduction heating and pipe heating methods, heat is
mainly transferred to coal by conduction from the heating elements.
Suppression of pore growth helps keep the microcrystal structure
and pore connections, thus minimizing the reduction of thermal
conductivity. For gas heating methods, coal is mainly heated by con-
vection of the hot gases. Suppression of pore growth limits the gas
flow. Furthermore, swelling of coal under spatial constraints may
close the cleats and other fractures, hindering convective flow.
Understanding heat transfer properties is essential for the heat man-
agement in UCTT. Therefore, pore growth and coal swelling behavior
during pyrolysis need to be characterized under physically con-
strained conditions, as a function of coal conversion, temperature
and heating rate. Thermal conductivity needs to be measured in situ
for providing reference data for heat transfer calculations in a UCTT
environment.

PIn addition, because the thermal conductivity strongly correlates
to the porous structure [196,198], the evolution of thermal conduc-
tivity can be used to infer the porous structure changes during coal
conversion. This provides an in-situ method to monitor the porous
structure changes of coal during the UCTT process because the elec-
trical signal used to calculate thermal conductivity responds in a
real-time manner. Therefore, research is needed to develop a
method for measuring the thermal conductivity of coal blocks during
the conversion process and establish the correlation between ther-
mal conductivity and porous structure (or coal conversion).

8.2. Mass transfer

PAnalogous to heat transfer, mass transfer in UCTT is strongly
dependent on the evolution of pore structures. In conventional pul-
verized coal pyrolysis, mass transfer time scale of gaseous volatiles
(1 ms) is usually smaller than the heating time scale for a high heat-
ing rate (1000(cid:1)10,000 K/s). Therefore, mass transfer is usually not
the rate-limiting step in conventional pulverized coal pyrolysis, and
the reactions can be described as kinetics controlled, unless the tem-
perature and heating rate are extremely high. In underground coal
pyrolysis that features large coal blocks, the mass transfer time may
exceed the heating time scale, depending on the heating conditions
and heat transfer properties of the coal. Under such conditions, the
mass transfer effects on pyrolysis cannot be neglected. Pyrolysis reac-
tions can shift from a kinetics-controlled regime to a diffusion-
controlled regime or a regime between the two. Gneshin et al. [9]
used a coal block reactor to study the heat and mass transfer in large
coal blocks. The block reactor (Fig. 10) was designed to accommodate
coal blocks up to 15 cm square and physically confine the coal, mim-
icking the spatial confinement conditions of UCTT process. Prelimi-
nary results showed that retention of tars in pores and fractures
occurred to a coal block of 15 cm3 (»5 kg) at 10 K/min heating rate,
partly contributing to a reduction of tar yields. In contrast, such
retention was not found in a coal core of 2 cm diameter pyrolyzed at
the same heating rate in a fixed-bed reactor. This demonstrates the
effect of large coal size in retaining the tars due to its extended length
scale (and time scale) of mass transfer. In addition, mass transfer also
affects product evolution. For example, secondary reactions and tar
coking become more prominent at extended mass transfer time.

Pconstrained conditions is thus determined by the overall effects of
coal swelling, pore growth and fracturing. Indeed, Xie et al. [155]
observed that the permeability of a packed coal bed initially
decreased due to swelling, which closes the voids between coal par-
ticles, and then started increasing rapidly once tar release com-
pleted. The rapid increase in permeability is obviously due to the
pyrolysis-induced porosity.

PIn a UCTT environment, pyrolysis takes place within large coal
blocks. Fu et al. [245] compared the swelling and shrinking behavior
of raw coal blocks and processed coal cakes (made by pressing pul-
verized coal particles) heated in a coke oven. These coal blocks and
cakes are about 10(cid:1)20 mm in diameter and 10(cid:1)14 mm in height.
They found that the swelling ratio of raw coal blocks is much larger
than that of processed coal cakes, while the shrinkage ratio has the
opposite behavior. The swelling ratio also increases with the size of
the coal block. These differences were attributed to the laminated
macrostructure of the raw coal, which was broken in pulverized coal
particles. These findings suggest that the swelling and shrinkage
behavior of coals blocks in a UCTT environment can be quite differ-
ent from the conventional pulverized coal particles, although these
results were obtained at unconfined conditions.

PA unique feature of UCTT is the spatial confinement and mechani-
cal loading from the overburden and surrounding formation. The
spatial confinement suppresses the coal swelling, while the mechan-
loading tends to cause coal deformation. The confinement
ical
imposed on coal body will certainly have an impact on the bubbling
mechanism, which subsequently determines the porous structure
during pyrolysis. Gneshin et al. [9] found that confinement has a pro-
nounced effect on both pore size distribution and pore morphology
when coal swelling is suppressed, as shown in Fig. 11. They used an
aluminum tube enclosing a coal core of 2 cm in diameter to mimic
the physical confinement in UCTT environment, and compared the
effects of confinement at two different heating rates. At a heating
rate of 10 K/min, pore size distribution moves towards the larger
end while strong metaplastic deformation and violent bubble rup-
tures occurs. This is because higher pore pressure builds up to resist
the spatial confinement. At 0.1 K/min, however, pore size distribu-
tion and pore morphology remain essentially unchanged because
coal swelling and thermoplastic deformation did not occur at such a
slow heating rate. In summary, confinement of coal tends to result
in more violent swelling at fast heating conditions while having little
impact at slow heating. Alternatively, swelling of coal in a con-
strained space tends to close the cleats and other fractures. These
factors suggest that the swelling and shrinkage behavior of coal
blocks in a UCTT environment may be quite different from conven-
tional pulverized coal pyrolysis.

PThe mechanical loading exerted by the overburden layer influen-
ces the coal structure development and gas transport property. He
et al. [246] studied the gas transport and deformation behavior of
coal blocks under stressed conditions. They used a uniaxial test
apparatus to apply mechanical loading to the cylindrical coal block
(5 cm in diameter and 10 cm in height) after slow heating the sample
to 45 °C, and used X-ray CT to examine the coal structure before and
after the test. Results show that micro and meso cracks (Fig. 12)
formed due to mechanical loading, and gas transport were strongly
associated with the formation of the cracks. The researchers suggest
that coal under mechanical loading can be considered as a brittle
material, which tends to crack. The cracks may promote the defor-
mation of the coal, and lead to non-uniform pressure and gas trans-
port in the deformed region. For example, some clustered cracks
may act as a gas reservoir, while other cracks may interconnect the
fractures and serve as flow channels. The cracks will in turn affect
the gas transport in the coal.

PThe conditions relevant to a UCTT process have unique impacts
on permeability development. Spatial confinement on coal swelling
favors the formation of macropores of a bituminous coal heated at

PSince UCTT will most likely be conducted at low temperature and
slow heating conditions, the pyrolysis reaction rates are expected to
be slow. Mass transfer will also be slow, considering the large size of
coal blocks. It is unclear which factor, heat transfer or mass transfer,
will determine pyrolysis reaction rates. Studies on mass transfer of
large-size coals under slow heating conditions will provide insight
into the controlling mechanism. Studies on this topic will also be
instrumental by providing reference data for the design and opera-
tion of heating and hydrocarbon collection systems in a UCTT pro-
cess. If mass transfer needs to be improved, hydraulic fracturing can
be employed to enhance the permeability of the coal seams. Alterna-
tively, if heat transfer is the limiting factor, heating system needs to
provide more heating elements or higher heating temperature, or to
use convective heating methods. Due to the high complexity and
cost, field test is premature at this time. Thus, lab-scale studies are
recommended using a coal block reactor [9], a triaxial test cell [158],
or a uniaxial loading cell [195] to obtain pyrolysis kinetics and
porosity data. These apparatus are capable of applying thermal and
mechanical loadings simultaneously, in a way that closely represents
the spatially confined environment in UCTT process while providing
well-controlled experimental conditions. The X-ray CT and low-field
NMR are powerful tools for in situ characterization of the porous
structure development.

8.3. Permeability modeling

i.e., non-reacting conditions. For example,

PCoal permeability plays a crucial role in the production and col-
lection of the pyrolysis yields. The permeability model is essential
for the predictions of the convective mass and heat transfer during
pyrolysis. Such predictions are critical for resolving the physics that
impact the reactions rates of pyrolysis and the convection of pyroly-
sis products. Previous studies on coal permeability modeling were
mostly focused on CBM production and CO2 sequestration applica-
tions,
researchers
[66,76,243,244] have attempted to describe the evolution of perme-
ability caused by coal matrix shrinking when CBM leaves the pore.
They found that coal permeability strongly correlates to strain and
stress. The evolution of coal permeability during pyrolysis is also
expected to be impacted by strain and stress. Wang et al. [195] also
observed that both thermal swelling and desorption of gas flow are
strongly affected by mechanical loading when heating coal blocks in
a specially designed reactor. The coal undergoes thermal swelling,
and the pores open up as being heated. Swelling of the coal may
close the cleats and other fractures, reducing the permeability of the
coal seam. On the other side, opening-up of the pores increases coal
permeability. Evolution of coal permeability under physically

P10 K/min (Fig. 11, A), which tends to increase the permeability. In
contrast, pores remain essentially unchanged because no thermo-
plastic swelling or deformation occurred at a slow heating rate of
0.1 K/min, which indicates that the native pores are capable of han-
dling the mass transfer at slow heating rate. Furthermore, it indi-
cates that the native pore distribution of raw coals can be used in
modeling the mass transfer at slow heating conditions, thus signifi-
cantly simplifying the modeling effort. Thermal-stress-induced

Pfracturing, however, occurred to a large coal block (15 cm cubed)
even if the coal was slowly heated at 0.1 K/min. The fractures obvi-
ously contribute to permeability development. These results,
although obtained at atmospheric pressure, suggest that heating
rate and temperature can be adjusted to control the permeability
development of the coal. Further, modeling of mass transfer at UCTT
conditions need to be adjusted accordingly. For example, a steep
temperature gradient can be applied to the coal block to induce large

Pthermal stress and fractures. Meanwhile, these results suggest that
previous coal permeability models need to be revised taking into
account the interaction of coal swelling with spatial confinement
and the effect of thermal stress, in addition to the mechanical stress
imposed by the overburden. Fundamental understanding of the
transient behavior of coal permeability as a function of coal conver-
sion is critical for capturing the physics of convective heat and mass
transfer in UCTT process. Permeability studies under conditions
closely resembling UCTT process (large size, high pressure, slow
heating, spatial confinement, mechanical loading) will provide more
precise data for describing the mass transfer in UCTT process.

8.4. Pyrolysis kinetics and modeling

PPyrolysis kinetics has been well studied for coal particles. In addi-
tion to temperature, heating rate and pressure, pyrolysis kinetics is
also dependent on the porous structure. The pyrolysis yields drive
pore growth and coal swelling. Meanwhile, the porous structure
determines heat and mass transfer. The relative time scales of heat
transfer and mass transfer determine if the reaction is kinetically
controlled or mass transfer controlled. The wealth of pyrolysis data
on coal particles provides a fairly good understanding on the correla-
tion between pyrolysis yields and heating conditions. The extrapola-
tion of these data to coal blocks in underground in situ pyrolysis,
however,
is not well understood. Westmoreland and Dickerson
[247] suggest that pyrolysis data for large coal blocks are essential to
perform such an extrapolation.

PFor underground coal pyrolysis, the effects of coal size and spatial
confinement on porous structure evolution cannot be neglected, as
discussed in previous sections. The much larger coal size drastically
increases heat and mass transfer time. The slow heating rate, which
is characteristic of a UCTT process, may also shift the reaction path-
ways of tar formation. Decrease in liquids yield that occurred to
slowly heated large coals was partly attributed to the change in tar-
formation pathways [9]. Secondary reactions, tar coking, cross-link-
ing and reticulation reactions become more pronounced at extended
residence times [248], which is typical for large size coal blocks. The
measurement of secondary reactions has large uncertainty [249].
The confinement of overburden layer suppresses pore growth and
coal swelling, resulting in complex effects on heat transfer and mass
transfer. The discussion in Sections 8.1 and 8.2 shows that the rela-
tive time scales of heat transfer and mass transfer are not well
understood for large coal that is pyrolyzed at slow heating condi-
tions. This underscores the importance of studying the effects of spa-
tial confinement and slow heating on pyrolysis kinetics of large coal
blocks.

PFor coal pyrolysis models, the prediction accuracy is dependent
on the heating conditions [250(cid:1)253]. Previous coal devolatilization
models were developed targeting pulverized coal combustion and
gasification; i.e., high temperature and high heating rate conditions.
Their accuracy and prediction capability have yet to be tested at con-
ditions relevant to underground thermal treatment. For example,
even for the Sommariva model [254], which was tested in a very
wide range of heating conditions, the lowest heating rate was 30 K/
min. In UCTT, the heating rate is expected to be much lower and the
coal size is much larger. Residence time of volatiles in the large coal
block is much longer than that in coal particles. Retention of volatiles
in the char at extended residence time was found to increase the
proportion of CH4 and H2 in the gaseous products in a fixed-bed
reactor experiment [255]. Secondary reactions, tar coking, cross-
linking and reticulation reactions become more important at
extended residence time [31,25,42,48]. These reactions affect the tar
yield and gas species yield. Therefore, the pyrolysis models need to
be validated against experimental data at conditions relevant to
UCTT process; i.e., large blocks, low temperature, slow heating and
high pressure with spatial confinement. Kinetic parameters need to

Pbe tuned to optimize the performance of the models at the specific
conditions. To perform such a validation, experimental data using
coal block reactors or fixed-bed reactors are recommended.

PAnother important difference between in situ coal pyrolysis and
conventional pulverized coal pyrolysis is the self-gasification by
inherent moisture of
the coal. Westmoreland and Dickerson
[247,256] found that the yield of CO and CO2 could not be recon-
ciled from the oxygen content of the parent coal, when they stud-
ied the in situ pyrolysis of large blocks of bituminous and lignite
coals. The more-than-expected yield of CO and CO2 was attributed
to the self-gasification of coal with moisture. In addition, the high
pressure of the UCTT environment also impacts reaction kinetics,
favoring gas yields. The work by Gneshin et al. [9] was performed
at atmospheric pressure. Kinetic studies of large coal under pressur-
ized conditions will provide more accurate data for UCTT process
design and optimization.

8.5. Heating technique

PThe heating technique is the key for cost reduction in heat
management. Wall conduction using electricity is associated
with a high energy penalty because a large fraction of the energy
is wasted in power generation. Although state-of-the-art com-
bined cycle power plants have thermal efficiency over 60%, the
thermal efficiency of power plants at the scale for UCTT is likely
lower [257]. Therefore, heating using an externally generated hot
gas circulating through pipes or directly injected into coal seams
is recommended in underground coal thermal treatment in order
to improve the thermal efficiency and the energy return. The hot
gas directly injected into coal seams promotes convective heat
and mass transfer.

PHowever, the wall conduction approach has advantages of
generating uniform porosity and enhancing permeability of coal
formation. It also leads to less swelling in the coal seam due to
the more uniform and mild heating. Wall conduction provides
better process control, which may lead to higher quality pyroly-
sis products. Volumetric heating provides a unique advantage for
the short time delay between process initiation and production.
Within 1-2 months, the extraction wells can be yielding coal
liquids. Volumetric heating also provides an even temperature
profile so that the coal conversion rate is uniform and the pro-
cess is more controlled.

PWaste gases generated during the coal conversion can be heated
and injected into the coal seam as a heat carrier. This stream of
hydrogen-rich gases can also augment coal conversion even when
electric heating is used. The recycled gases can diffuse into the for-
mation and be extracted to surface after exchanging heat with coal.
Product gases can be used to fire a gas turbine to generate electricity
in addition to providing a carrier for recycling energy.

PUsing the heat from fuel cell operation is an energy-saving way to
heat the coal formation. It utilizes the heat that otherwise would be
wasted in conventional internal combustion engine when burning
the fuels. The geothermic fuel cell and EPICC concepts are thus high
efficiency and low-carbon in nature. Given the potential to reach
70% thermodynamic efficiency [119], they offer great promise for
UCTT. Major barriers towards the application of fuel cell technology
in UCTT are the subsurface operation and maintenance of fuel cell,
degradation of cathodes, high operating temperature, and the signif-
icantly high cost [119]. System integration can also be a problem
when electricity generation and heat generation of the fuel cell need
to be balanced.

PRecently, solar and wind have gained more market share and
show great future for energy demand. Cost of these renewable
energies is dropping sharply as technology advances. Therefore,
besides the onsite generation of energy sources, wind and solar
have a great potential in coal and oil shale underground thermal

wind is less of a problem for UCTT than in providing electricity to
the grid.

9. Summary

PThis review provides a general description of the UCTT pro-
cess and discusses its feasibility by comparing it with under-
ground oil shale retorting and UCG. A comparison of the physical
properties of coal with oil shale suggests that UCTT is a promis-
ing technology for extracting high-value hydrocarbon fuels from
deeply buried coal seams while leaving behind an ideal site for
CO2 sequestration. Leveraging the readily available literature on
underground oil shale retorting, promising technologies that can
be adapted to UCTT have been identified. Challenges and issues
of the UCTT process are discussed from systems-level and opera-
tional perspectives. Studies on conventional pulverized coal
pyrolysis are reviewed in the context of identifying the key pro-
cess parameters and their impacts on product yield and composi-
tion. The review is then extended to whether these studies can
be readily applied to a UCTT environment. It clearly shows that
there are knowledge gaps between conventional pulverized coal
pyrolysis and underground in situ thermal treatment. To bridge
these gaps, future research needs are identified.

PIn brief, underground coal thermal treatment is a slow-heat-
low-to-medium temperature, high-pressure pyrolysis pro-
ing,
cess that takes place in large coal blocks. The ideal site for UCTT
is a deeply-buried high-volatile bituminous coal that has under-
gone CBM production. Light hydrocarbon gases dominate the
pyrolysis products with a composition similar to SNG. The
underground environment imposes spatial constraints and litho-
static pressures on the coal, which suppress the swelling and
pore growth that are typical
in conventional pulverized coal
pyrolysis. This distinctive feature of UCTT gives rise to the ques-
tion whether the previous literature on pulverized coal pyrolysis
can be directly applied to the UCTT process. In particular, the
evolution of pore structure determines heat and mass transfer
behavior, which will strongly impact the pyrolysis kinetics and
product transport in large coal blocks. In addition, the heat and
mass transfer properties are the prerequisite for design of the
heating and product collection systems. Therefore, fundamental
studies need to focus on pyrolysis of physically-constrained coal,
with an objective to understand the impact of spatial constraints
on the evolution of porous structure, and its effects on heat and
mass transfer properties. Kinetic studies at slow-heating and
high-pressure conditions also deserve to be revisited for large
coal blocks.
