    "question_text": "How do pressure conditions in CVD reactors affect the resulting graphene domain sizes and layer structures, based on experimental evidence from atmospheric pressure and low-pressure CVD processes? Analyze the relationship between pressure conditions and graphene characteristics using principles of fluid mechanics and heat transfer.",
    "standard_answer": "Pressure conditions in CVD reactors significantly influence graphene characteristics through their effects on gas dynamics and thermal transport. At atmospheric pressure, the higher gas density leads to different precursor transport characteristics compared to low-pressure conditions. Experimental evidence shows that Lee et al. achieved wafer-scale graphene films on 3-inch diameter substrates under ambient pressure conditions, where few-layer graphene (3-8 layers) formed on Ni catalysts while mono- and bi-layer graphene formed on Cu catalysts. In contrast, Li et al. demonstrated that low-pressure CVD produced graphene with average domain sizes of approximately 140 mm² on Cu foils at 1025°C, with domains having areas of tens of square micrometers. The transition from atmospheric to low-pressure conditions alters the gas-phase transport mechanisms, where higher pressure environments with greater gas density affect precursor delivery to the substrate surface, while reduced pressure conditions modify the thermal boundary layer characteristics and surface reaction kinetics. These pressure-dependent variations in fluid transport and heat transfer directly impact nucleation density and carbon precursor availability, ultimately determining the final graphene domain sizes and layer structures observed in experimental results.",

      "1": "Lee et al. [56] obtained wafer-scale, ambient-pressure CVD growth of high-quality graphene films on 3 in. diameter SiO2/Si substrates coated with Cu (700 nm thick) or Ni (300 nm thick). The substrates were heated up to 1000 °C under ambient pressure with flowing H2 and Ar (or He). Graphene growth proceeded by flowing reaction gas mixtures (CH4: H2: Ar = 250: 325: 1000 sccm for Ni and CH4: H2: He = 50: 15: 1000 sccm for Cu) for »5 min. The FLG grew on the Ni catalyst (3(cid:1)8 layers), while mono- and bi-layer graphene was formed on the Cu catalyst.",
