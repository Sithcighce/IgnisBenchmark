    "question_text": "Calculate the mass loss rate of active cellulose during pyrolysis at 500 K using the Banyasz scheme kinetics, given pre-exponential factors and activation energies for reactions R1, R2, and R3. Assume initial cellulose mass is 1 mg and active cellulose mass is 0.5 mg at this instant.",
    "standard_answer": "Using the Banyasz scheme, the mass loss rate of active cellulose (dm_AC/dt) is governed by its formation from cellulose (R1) and consumption via ring fragmentation (R2) and transglycosylation (R3). The rate equation is: dm_AC/dt = m_CELL * A1 * exp(-E1/(R*T)) - m_AC * [A2 * exp(-E2/(R*T)) + A3 * exp(-E3/(R*T))]. Given kinetics from the paper: A1 = 3.2e14 s⁻¹, E1 = 198 kJ/mol; A2 = 1.0e14 s⁻¹, E2 = 195.9 kJ/mol; A3 = 4.0e10 s⁻¹, E3 = 151.1 kJ/mol; R = 8.314 J/(mol·K); T = 500 K; m_CELL = 1 mg; m_AC = 0.5 mg. First, compute exponential terms: exp(-E1/(R*T)) = exp(-198000/(8.314*500)) = exp(-47.62) ≈ 5.6e-21; exp(-E2/(R*T)) = exp(-195900/(8.314*500)) = exp(-47.12) ≈ 7.4e-21; exp(-E3/(R*T)) = exp(-151100/(8.314*500)) = exp(-36.34) ≈ 2.4e-16. Then, calculate rates: Formation rate = 1 * 3.2e14 * 5.6e-21 = 1.792e-6 mg/s; Consumption rate = 0.5 * [1.0e14 * 7.4e-21 + 4.0e10 * 2.4e-16] = 0.5 * [7.4e-7 + 9.6e-6] = 0.5 * 1.034e-5 = 5.17e-6 mg/s. Thus, dm_AC/dt = 1.792e-6 - 5.17e-6 = -3.378e-6 mg/s. The negative value indicates net consumption of active cellulose, primarily driven by transglycosylation (R3) due to its lower activation energy at this temperature, consistent with the scheme's prediction of dominant tar formation under moderate conditions.",

    "question_text": "How do alkali and alkaline earth metallic (AAEM) species catalyze cellulose pyrolysis to favor char formation over levoglucosan production, and what are the mechanistic pathways involved?",
    "standard_answer": "AAEM species such as potassium, sodium, and calcium catalyze cellulose pyrolysis by promoting fragmentation and dehydration reactions over transglycosylation, thereby increasing char yield and reducing levoglucosan (LGA) production. These inorganics act as Lewis acids that coordinate with oxygen atoms in the cellulose glucosidic bonds, lowering the activation energy for bond scission and facilitating ring-opening reactions. This shifts the competitive pathways: transglycosylation (which produces LGA) is suppressed, while fragmentation to low molecular weight compounds (LMWC) like hydroxyacetaldehyde (HAA) is enhanced. Additionally, AAEM species promote secondary charring reactions by catalyzing the decomposition of primary tars on char surfaces or in the vapor phase, leading to increased cross-linking and aromatization. For instance, potassium ions can catalyze dehydration reactions that form unsaturated intermediates, which subsequently polymerize into char. The catalytic effect is concentration-dependent; even trace amounts (e.g., 0.05% NaCl) can reduce LGA yields by a factor of 6 and increase HAA yields by over 40 times, demonstrating the profound impact of inorganics on product distribution.",

    "standard_answer": "Multi-scale modeling of biomass pyrolysis integrates three hierarchical levels: molecular, particle, and reactor, to accurately describe the process. At the molecular level, detailed reaction mechanisms for cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin are employed, including primary pyrolysis and secondary charring reactions, often using schemes like Ranzi or RAC that account for competitive pathways and product composition. At the particle level, intra-particle phenomena such as heat and mass transfer, chemical reactions, and drying are modeled. Critical phenomena include: (1) Heat transfer limitations, where internal temperature gradients affect reaction rates; (2) Mass transfer of volatiles through porous char, influencing secondary reactions and char yield; (3) Evaporation of intermediate liquid compounds (ILC) and their reactive boiling ejection; and (4) Catalytic effects of inorganics on reaction pathways. These are governed by non-dimensional numbers (e.g., Biot for heat transfer, Thiele for reaction-diffusion). At the reactor level, models for fixed or fluidized beds incorporate particle-level submodels into computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulate hydrodynamics, heat exchange, and product distribution. This multi-scale approach ensures that molecular kinetics inform particle behavior, which in turn affects reactor performance, enabling predictive design of pyrolysis systems for optimized bio-oil and char production.",

    "question_text": "Explain how vapor retention time and pressure influence char yield during cellulose pyrolysis through secondary charring reactions, based on the provided paper content.",
    "standard_answer": "Secondary charring reactions play a crucial role in determining char yield during cellulose pyrolysis by converting primary volatiles into additional char. The extent of these reactions is strongly influenced by vapor retention time and pressure conditions. When the retention time of volatiles in the solid matrix is increased, secondary reactions are promoted, leading to higher char yield. This occurs because longer residence times allow more primary tars to undergo secondary decomposition reactions that form additional char. Pressure also significantly affects char yield through its impact on secondary reactions. At lower pressures, fewer secondary reactions take place, which reduces the char yield. This pressure effect is attributed to reduced molecular collision frequency and altered reaction kinetics under vacuum conditions. The combined influence of retention time and pressure demonstrates that char yield is not solely determined by temperature but is governed by transport limitations and reaction conditions that control the extent of secondary charring processes.",

Discuss the role of activation energies in this competition while avoiding unsupported numerical values.",
    "standard_answer": "In cellulose pyrolysis, active cellulose undergoes decomposition through two competitive pathways: transglycosylation and ring fragmentation. Transglycosylation involves depolymerization through glycosidic bond cleavage, producing primarily levoglucosan (LGA) and other sugars, while ring fragmentation entails scission of the glucose ring to form low molecular weight compounds (LMWC) such as hydroxyacetaldehyde (HAA), formaldehyde, and CO. The ring fragmentation pathway has a higher activation energy than transglycosylation, making it more temperature-sensitive according to Arrhenius kinetics. Consequently, at higher temperatures, ring fragmentation becomes dominant, leading to increased production of LMWC and permanent gases. Conversely, transglycosylation prevails at moderate temperatures, maximizing tar yields. Optimal conditions for LGA and liquid production occur at medium temperatures/heating rates, where charring is minimized and fragmentation is not yet dominant. This temperature-dependent competition directly impacts bio-oil composition, with transglycosylation favoring liquid bio-oil production and fragmentation shifting product distribution toward gaseous species at elevated temperatures.",
    "original_text": {
      "1": "Active cellulose, with a low degree of polymerisation, can be decomposed by two competitive reactions: a slow reaction that produces char plus permanent gases (reaction R2), and the main reaction that produces a tarry pyrolyzate containing levoglucosan (LGA) and other sugars (reaction R3).",
