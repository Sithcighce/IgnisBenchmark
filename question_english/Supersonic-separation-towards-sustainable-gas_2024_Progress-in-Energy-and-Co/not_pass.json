    "question_text": "How do heavy hydrocarbons and CO₂ affect the heating value of natural gas, and what role does supersonic separation technology play in optimizing natural gas quality for energy conversion systems?",
    "standard_answer": "Heavy hydrocarbons such as ethane, propane, and butane contain more energy per volume than methane, the main constituent of natural gas. The gas benefits from their presence as it boosts the overall energy content, which is particularly useful for applications needing greater heating values. However, contaminants such as CO₂ can decrease the heating value of natural gas. The decrease in heating value can affect how efficiently appliances and equipment that use natural gas for heating function. CO₂ in natural gas also contributes to its overall carbon footprint. Prioritizing efforts to reduce CO₂ emissions from natural gas is crucial, which can be achieved through implementing CCS or other mitigation technologies. Supersonic separators (SSs) have emerged as a promising technology for gas purification and carbon capture, offering advantages such as cleaner processing, simplicity, reliability, safety, and cost-effectiveness. These separators utilize converging-diverging nozzles to generate supersonic flows, resulting in lower temperatures during expansion and subsequent condensation of impurities. By removing CO₂ and other impurities, supersonic separators help optimize natural gas for efficient combustion while supporting carbon capture and storage goals.",
