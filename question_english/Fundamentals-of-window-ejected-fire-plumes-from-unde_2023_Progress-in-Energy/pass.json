    "question_text": "What is the significance of the neutral plane height in compartment fire dynamics, and how is it derived from the static pressure difference across the window?",
    "standard_answer": "The neutral plane height (Hn) is a critical parameter in compartment fire dynamics, representing the level at the window where the static pressure difference between the interior and exterior is zero, resulting in no net flow. It divides the window into an upper section where hot gases exit and a lower section where fresh air enters. The derivation starts from Bernoulli's equation applied to the buoyancy-driven flow, assuming a uniform temperature inside the compartment (Tg). The pressure difference at height z is ΔP(z) = (ρ∞ - ρg)g(z - Hn), where ρ∞ and ρg are the ambient and interior gas densities, respectively. Setting ΔP(Hn) = 0 gives Hn/H = 1 / [1 + (ρg/ρ∞)^(1/3)]. Using the ideal gas law, ρg/ρ∞ = T∞/Tg, so Hn/H = 1 / [1 + (Tg/T∞)^(1/3)]. This relationship shows that the neutral plane rises as the interior temperature increases, reducing the effective area for outflow and influencing the air inflow rate, which directly affects the HRR inside the compartment and the conditions for flame ejection.",

      "1": "The position of the neutral plane height above the bottom of the window (Hn, a reference height with theoretically no relative flow of gas, where ΔP (z=Hn)=0), is found to be determined solely by the ratio of the temperatures inside and outside of the compartment [52,53]",

    "question_text": "How does sub-atmospheric pressure at high altitudes affect the combustion processes and entrainment dynamics in window-ejected fire plumes?",
    "standard_answer": "Sub-atmospheric pressure at high altitudes reduces both the oxygen partial pressure and the ambient air density, significantly impacting combustion and entrainment in window-ejected fire plumes. The lower oxygen availability decreases the combustion rate inside the compartment and in the ejected plume, leading to longer flame heights as more vertical travel is needed to entrain sufficient oxygen for complete combustion. The reduced air density (ρ∞) diminishes the buoyancy force, since buoyancy is proportional to (ρ∞ - ρ_g), slowing the plume's vertical acceleration and extending its horizontal reach. Entrainment is also affected; the entrainment coefficient α decreases under sub-atmospheric conditions because the lower density reduces the momentum-driven mixing at the plume interface. This results in poorer air-fuel mixing, lower temperatures due to reduced combustion intensity, and altered flame stability. Experiments at high altitudes (e.g., 0.64 atm) show that the air entrainment coefficient is lower than at standard pressure, necessitating adjustments in scaling laws for flame height and temperature profiles to account for these pressure-dependent effects.",

    "question_text": "How does the presence of side walls or facing walls constrain air entrainment into window-ejected fire plumes, and what are the resulting effects on flame height and temperature profiles?",
    "standard_answer": "The presence of side walls or facing walls physically restricts the lateral and frontal air entrainment into the window-ejected fire plume, reducing the available perimeter for ambient air to mix with the hot, fuel-rich gases. This constraint alters the entrainment dynamics by limiting the turbulent mixing at the plume boundaries, which is critical for combustion completeness. Reduced entrainment decreases the dilution of unburned fuel and lowers the combustion efficiency, leading to a longer flame height as the plume must travel further vertically to entrain sufficient oxygen for complete combustion. Additionally, the constrained entrainment reduces heat losses to the surroundings, resulting in higher temperatures within the plume due to less convective cooling. The flame becomes more attached to the facade, intensifying heat transfer to adjacent surfaces. Quantitatively, the entrainment restriction can be characterized by dimensionless parameters like K, which accounts for side wall separation distances, and models show that flame height Zf increases under these conditions due to the reduced entrainment coefficient.",

      "1": "A ‘constrained’ boundary, such as a facing wall [61,76–78] or side walls [10,43,79,80] (in Fig. 2 (a)), reduces the entrainment of air into the fire plume (and the smoke plume above), leading to larger flame heights and increased temperatures.",

    "standard_answer": "Wind alters window-ejected fire plume behavior through momentum interactions with buoyancy-driven flows, significantly affecting flame morphology and heat transfer. The wind-induced momentum competes with and modifies the buoyancy-induced momentum of the fire plume, leading to changes in flame position, shape, and thermal characteristics. For all wind directions, this interaction can push the fire plume closer to the facade, which increases convective heat transfer to the building surface despite potential reductions in flame temperature. The pressure differences induced by wind also modify the neutral plane height at the window and alter air inflow rates, impacting the critical heat release rate required for flame ejection. These mechanisms operate differently depending on wind direction due to varying momentum vectors relative to the window opening, but the fundamental physics involves the competition between externally imposed wind momentum and internally generated buoyancy momentum in the fire plume system.",

Discuss how these length scales relate to the outflow characteristics and air entrainment mechanisms of under-ventilated compartment fires.",
    "standard_answer": "The characteristic length scales l₁ and l₂ are fundamental parameters in window-ejected fire plume analysis. l₁ = (AH¹/²)²/⁵ represents the characteristic length parallel to the window and relates to the convective heat flow through the ventilation opening. This scale emerges from the mass flow rate balance where the outflowing hot gas equals the inflowing fresh air (ṁg = ṁa = 0.5A√H), and the convective heat flow rate (Q̇conv = ṁgcpΔTg) at the window. The dimensionless expression Q̇conv/(ρ∞cpT∞√g l₁⁵/²) = 7.54(ΔTg/T∞) indicates l₁'s role in normalizing flame height and convective heat transfer parameters. l₂ = (AH²)¹/⁴ represents the characteristic length normal to the window and captures the horizontal distance before the flow transitions from horizontal to vertical. This scale arises from the competition between momentum flux (M₀ ≈ ṁgvg) and buoyancy flux (J₀ ≈ ṁgΔTg/T∞g) at the window outlet, specifically l₂ ≈ (M₀/ρ∞)³/⁴/(J₀/ρ∞)¹/². Physically, l₁ governs the vertical development and convective heat transfer scaling of the plume, while l₂ determines the flame depth and horizontal extension before buoyancy dominates. These scales collectively describe how the window dimensions (area A, height H) control the initial outflow conditions, with l₁ relating to thermal energy transport and l₂ to the momentum-buoyancy transition that affects air entrainment patterns and flame attachment to the facade.",
